                    <head>CHAPTER FIRST: Burzee</head>

                    <p>HAVE you heard of the great Forest of Burzee? Nurse used to sing of it when I
                        was a child. She sang of the big tree-trunks, standing close together, with
                        their roots intertwining below the earth and their branches intertwining
                        above it; of their rough coating of bark and queer, gnarled limbs; of the
                        bushy foliage that roofed the entire forest, save where the sunbeams found a
                        path through which to touch the ground in little spots and to cast <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0025" n="2"/> weird and curious shadows over the
                        mosses, the lichens and the drifts of dried leaves. </p>
                    <p>The Forest of Burzee is mighty and grand and awesome to those who steal
                        beneath its shade. Coming from the sunlit meadows into its mazes it seems at
                        first gloomy, then pleasant, and afterward filled with never-ending
                        delights. </p>
                    <p>For hundreds of years it has flourished in all its magnificence, the silence
                        of its inclosure unbroken save by the chirp of busy chipmunks, the growl of
                        wild beasts and the songs of birds. </p>
                    <p>Yet Burzee has its inhabitants&mdash;for all this. Nature peopled it in
                        the beginning with Fairies, Knooks, Ryls and Nymphs. As long as the Forest
                        stands it will be a home, a refuge and a playground to these sweet
                        immortals, who revel undisturbed in its depths. </p>
                    <p>Civilization has never yet reached Burzee Will it ever, I wonder? </p>

                    <head>CHAPTER SECOND: The Child of the Forest</head>
                    <p> ONCE, so long ago our great-grandfathers could scarcely have heard it
                        mentioned, there lived within the great Forest of Burzee a wood-nymph named
                        Necile. She was closely related to the mighty Queen Zurline, and her home
                        was beneath the shade of a widespreading oak. Once every year, on Budding
                        Day, when the trees put forth their new buds, Necile held the Golden Chalice
                        of Ak to the lips of the Queen, who drank therefrom to the prosperity of the
                        Forest. So you see she was a nymph of some importance, and, moreover, it is
                        said she was highly regarded because of her beauty and grace. </p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0029" n="4"/>
                    <p>When she was created she could not have told; Queen Zurline could not have
                        told; the great Ak himself could not have told. It was long ago when the
                        world was new and nymphs were needed to guard the forests and to minister to
                        the wants of the young trees. Then, on some day not remembered, Necile
                        sprang into being; radiant, lovely, straight and slim as the sapling she was
                        created to guard. </p>
                    <p>Her hair was the color that lines a chestnut-bur; her eyes were blue in the
                        sunlight and purple in the shade; her cheeks bloomed with the faint pink
                        that edges the clouds at sunset; her lips were full red, pouting and sweet.
                        For costume she adopted oak-leaf green; all the wood-nymphs dress in that
                        color and know no other so desirable. Her dainty feet were sandal-clad,
                        while her head remained bare of covering other than her silken tresses. </p>
                    <p>Necile's duties were few and simple. She kept hurtful weeds from growing
                        beneath her trees <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0030" n="5"/> and sapping the
                        earth-food required by her charges. She frightened away the Gadgols, who
                        took evil delight in flying against the tree-trunks and wounding them so
                        that they drooped and died from the poisonous contact. In dry seasons she
                        carried water from the brooks and pools and moistened the roots of her
                        thirsty dependents. </p>
                    <p>That was in the beginning. The weeds had now learned to avoid the forests
                        where woodnymphs dwelt; the loathsome Gadgols no longer dared come nigh; the
                        trees had become old and sturdy and could bear the drought better than when
                        fresh-sprouted. So Necile's duties were lessened, and time grew laggard,
                        while succeeding years became more tiresome and uneventful than the nymph's
                        joyous spirit loved. </p>
                    <p>Truly the forest-dwellers did not lack amusement. Each full moon they danced
                        in the Royal Circle of the Queen. There were also the Feast of Nuts, the
                        Jubilee of Autumn Tintings, the solemn ceremony of Leaf Shedding and the <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0031" n="6"/> revelry of Budding Day. But these
                        periods of enjoyment were far apart, and left many weary hours between. </p>
                    <p>That a wood-nymph should grow discontented was not thought of by Necile's
                        sisters. It came upon her only after many years of brooding. But when once
                        she had settled in her mind that life was irksome she had no patience with
                        her condition, and longed to do something of real interest and to pass her
                        days in ways hitherto undreamed of by forest nymphs. The Law of the Forest
                        alone restrained her from going forth in search of adventure. </p>
                    <p>While this mood lay heavy upon pretty Necile it chanced that the great Ak
                        visited the Forest of Burzee and allowed the wood-nymphs as was their
                        wont&mdash;to lie at his feet and listen to the words of wisdom that
                        fell from his lips. Ak is the Master Woodsman of the world; he sees
                        everything, and knows more than the sons of men. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0032" n="7"/>
                    <p>That night he held the Queen's hand, for he loved the nymphs as a father
                        loves his children; and Necile lay at his feet with many of her sisters and
                        earnestly harkened as he spoke. </p>
                    <p>"We live so happily, my fair ones, in our forest glades,'' said Ak, stroking
                        his grizzled beard thoughtfully, "that we know nothing of the sorrow and
                        misery that fall to the lot of those poor mortals who inhabit the open
                        spaces of the earth. They are not of our race, it is true, yet compassion
                        well befits beings so fairly favored as ourselves. Often as I pass by the
                        dwelling of some suffering mortal I am tempted to stop and banish the poor
                        thing's misery. Yet suffering, in moderation, is the natural lot of mortals,
                        and it is not our place to interfere with the laws of Nature.'' </p>
                    <p>"Nevertheless,'' said the fair Queen, nodding her golden head at the Master
                        Woodsman, "it would not be a vain guess that Ak has often assisted these
                        hapless mortals.'' </p>
                    <p>Ak smiled. </p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0033" n="8"/>
                    <p>"Sometimes,'' he replied, "when they are very young&mdash;`children,' the
                        mortals call them&mdash; have stopped to rescue them from misery. The
                        men and women I dare not interfere with; they must bear the burdens Nature
                        has imposed upon them. But the helpless infants, the innocent children of
                        men, have a right to be happy until they become full-grown and able to bear
                        the trials of humanity. So I feel I am justified in assisting them. Not long
                        ago&mdash;a year, maybe&mdash;I found four poor children huddled in
                        a wooden hut, slowly freezing to death. Their parents had gone to a
                        neighboring village for food, and had left a fire to warm their little ones
                        while they were absent. But a storm arose and drifted the snow in their
                        path, so they were long on the road. Meantime the fire went out and the
                        frost crept into the bones of the waiting children.'' </p>
                    <p>"Poor things!'' murmured the Queen softly. "What did you do?'' </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0034" n="9"/>
                    <p>"I called Nelko, bidding him fetch wood from my forests and breathe upon it
                        until the fire blazed again and warmed the little room where the children
                        lay. Then they ceased shivering and fell asleep until their parents came.'' </p>
                    <p>"I am glad you did thus,'' said the good Queen, beaming upon the Master; and
                        Necile, who had eagerly listened to every word, echoed in a whisper: "I,
                        too, am glad!'' </p>
                    <p>"And this very night,'' continued Ak, "as I came to the edge of Burzee I
                        heard a feeble cry, which I judged came from a human infant. I looked about
                        me and found, close to the forest, a helpless babe, lying quite naked upon
                        the grasses and wailing piteously. Not far away, screened by the forest,
                        crouched Shiegra, the lioness, intent upon devouring the infant for her
                        evening meal.'' </p>
                    <p>"And what did you do, Ak?'' asked the Queen, breathlessly. </p>
                    <p>"Not much, being in a hurry to greet my <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0035"
                            n="10"/> nymphs. But I commanded Shiegra to lie close to the babe, and
                        to give it her milk to quiet its hunger. And I told her to send word
                        throughout the forest, to all beasts and reptiles, that the child should not
                        be harmed.'' </p>
                    <p>"I am glad you did thus,'' said the good Queen again, in a tone of relief;
                        but this time Necile did not echo her words, for the nymph, filled with a
                        strange resolve, had suddenly stolen away from the group. </p>
                    <p>Swiftly her lithe form darted through the forest paths until she reached the
                        edge of mighty Burzee, when she paused to gaze curiously about her. Never
                        until now had she ventured so far, for the Law of the Forest had placed the
                        nymphs in its inmost depths. </p>
                    <p>Necile knew she was breaking the Law, but the thought did not give pause to
                        her dainty feet. She had decided to see with her own eyes this infant Ak had
                        told of, for she had never yet beheld a child of man. All the immortals are
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0036" n="Illustration"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0037"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0038" n="11"/> full-grown; there are no children
                        among them. Peering through the trees Necile saw the child lying on the
                        grass. But now it was sweetly sleeping, having been comforted by the milk
                        drawn from Shiegra. It was not old enough to know what peril means; if it
                        did not feel hunger it was content. </p>


                    <p>Softly the nymph stole to the side of the babe and knelt upon the sward, her
                        long robe of rose leaf color spreading about her like a gossamer cloud. Her
                        lovely countenance expressed curiosity and surprise, but, most of all, a
                        tender, womanly pity. The babe was new-born, chubby and pink. It was
                        entirely helpless. While the nymph gazed the infant opened its eyes, smiled
                        upon her, and stretched out two dimpled arms. In another instant Necile had
                        caught it to her breast and was hurrying with it through the forest paths.

                    <head> CHAPTER THIRD: The Adoption</head>
                    <p> THE Master Woodsman suddenly rose, with knitted brows. "There is a strange
                        presence in the Forest,'' he declared. Then the Queen and her nymphs turned
                        and saw standing before them Necile, with the sleeping infant clasped
                        tightly in her arms and a defiant look in her deep blue eyes. </p>
                    <p>And thus for a moment they remained, the nymphs filled with surprise and
                        consternation, but the brow of the Master Woodsman gradually clearing as he
                        gazed intently upon the beautiful immortal who had wilfully broken the Law.
                        Then the great Ak, to the wonder of all, laid his hand softly on Necile's
                        flowing locks and kissed her on her fair forehead. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0040" n="13"/>
                    <p>"For the first time within my knowledge,'' said he, gently, "a nymph has
                        defied me and my laws; yet in my heart can I find no word of chiding. What
                        is your desire, Necile?'' </p>
                    <p>"Let me keep the child!'' she answered, beginning to tremble and falling on
                        her knees in supplication. </p>
                    <p>"Here, in the Forest of Burzee, where the human race has never yet
                        penetrated?'' questioned Ak. </p>
                    <p>"Here, in the Forest of Burzee,'' replied the nymph, boldly. "It is my home,
                        and I am weary for lack of occupation. Let me care for the babe! See how
                        weak and helpless it is. Surely it can not harm Burzee nor the Master
                        Woodsman of the World!'' </p>
                    <p>"But the Law, child, the Law!'' cried Ak, sternly. </p>
                    <p>"The Law is made by the Master Woodsman,'' returned Necile; "if he bids me
                        care for the babe he himself has saved from death, who <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0041" n="14"/> in all the world dare oppose me?''
                        Queen Zurline, who had listened intently to this conversation, clapped her
                        pretty hands gleefully at the nymph's answer. </p>
                    <p>"You are fairly trapped, O Ak!'' she exclaimed, laughing. "Now, I pray you,
                        give heed to Necile's petition.'' </p>
                    <p>The Woodsman, as was his habit when in thought, stroked his grizzled beard
                        slowly. Then he said: </p>
                    <p>"She shall keep the babe, and I will give it my protection. But I warn you
                        all that as this is the first time I have relaxed the Law, so shall it be
                        the last time. Never more, to the end of the World, shall a mortal be
                        adopted by an immortal. Otherwise would we abandon our happy existence for
                        one of trouble and anxiety. Good night, my nymphs!'' </p>
                    <p>Then Ak was gone from their midst, and Necile hurried away to her bower to
                        rejoice over her new-found treasure. </p>

                    <head> CHAPTER FOURTH: Claus</head>
                    <p> ANOTHER day found Necile's bower the most popular place in the Forest. The
                        nymphs clustered around her and the child that lay asleep in her lap, with
                        expressions of curiosity and delight. Nor were they wanting in praises for
                        the great Ak's kindness in allowing Necile to keep the babe and to care for
                        it. Even the Queen came to peer into the innocent childish face and to hold
                        a helpless, chubby fist in her own fair hand. </p>
                    <p>"What shall we call him, Necile?'' she asked, smiling. "He must have a name,
                        you know.'' </p>
                    <p>"Let him be called Claus,'' answered Necile, "for that means `a little one.'
                        '' </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0045" n="16"/>
                    <p>"Rather let him be called Neclaus,''<ref n="1" target="n1">[1]</ref> returned
                        the Queen, "for that will mean `Necile's little one.' '' <note id="n1" n="1">
                            <seg type="note-symbol">[1]</seg>
                            <p>Some people have spelled this name Nicklaus, and others Nicolas,
                                which is the reason that Santa Claus is still known in some lands as
                                St. Nicolas. But, of course, Neclaus is his right name, and Claus
                                the nickname given him by his adopted mother, the fair nymph
                            Necile.</p>
                        </note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The nymphs clapped their hands in delight, and Neclaus became the infant's
                        name, although Necile loved best to call him Claus, and in afterdays many of
                        her sisters followed her example. </p>
                    <p>Necile gathered the softest moss in all the forest for Claus to lie upon, and
                        she made his bed in her own bower. Of food the infant had no lack. The
                        nymphs searched the forest for bell-udders, which grow upon the goa-tree and
                        when opened are found to be filled with sweet milk. And the soft-eyed does
                        willingly gave a share of their milk to support the little stranger, while
                        Shiegra, the lioness, often crept stealthily <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0046" n="17"/> into Necile's bower and purred
                        softly as she lay beside the babe and fed it. </p>
                    <p>So the little one flourished and grew big and sturdy day by day, while Necile
                        taught him to speak and to walk and to play. </p>
                    <p>His thoughts and words were sweet and gentle, for the nymphs knew no evil and
                        their hearts were pure and loving. He became the pet of the forest, for Ak's
                        decree had forbidden beast or reptile to molest him, and he walked
                        fearlessly wherever his will guided him. </p>
                    <p>Presently the news reached the other immortals that the nymphs of Burzee had
                        adopted a human infant, and that the act had been sanctioned by the great
                        Ak. Therefore many of them came to visit the little stranger, looking upon
                        him with much interest. First the Ryls, who are first cousins to the
                        wood-nymphs, although so differently formed. For the Ryls are required to
                        watch over the flowers and plants, as the nymphs watch over the forest <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0047" n="18"/> trees. They search the wide world
                        for the food required by the roots of the flowering plants, while the
                        brilliant colors possessed by the full-blown flowers are due to the dyes
                        placed in the soil by the Ryls, which are drawn through the little veins in
                        the roots and the body of the plants, as they reach maturity. The Ryls are a
                        busy people, for their flowers bloom and fade continually, but they are
                        merry and light-hearted and are very popular with the other immortals. </p>
                    <p>Next came the Knooks, whose duty it is to watch over the beasts of the world,
                        both gentle and wild. The Knooks have a hard time of it, since many of the
                        beasts are ungovernable and rebel against restraint. But they know how to
                        manage them, after all, and you will find that certain laws of the Knooks
                        are obeyed by even the most ferocious animals. Their anxieties make the
                        Knooks look old and worn and crooked, and their natures are a bit rough from
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0048" n="19"/> associating with wild
                        creatures continually; yet they are most useful to humanity and to the world
                        in general, as their laws are the only laws the forest beasts recognize
                        except those of the Master Woodsman. </p>
                    <p>Then there were the Fairies, the guardians of mankind, who were much
                        interested in the adoption of Claus because their own laws forbade them to
                        become familiar with their human charges. There are instances on record
                        where the Fairies have shown themselves to human beings, and have even
                        conversed with them; but they are supposed to guard the lives of mankind
                        unseen and unknown, and if they favor some people more than others it is
                        because these have won such distinction fairly, as the Fairies are very just
                        and impartial. But the idea of adopting a child of men had never occurred to
                        them because it was in every way opposed to their laws; so their curiosity
                        was intense to <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0049" n="20"/> behold the little
                        stranger adopted by Necile and her sister nymphs. </p>
                    <p>Claus looked upon the immortals who thronged around him with fearless eyes
                        and smiling lips. He rode laughingly upon the shoulders of the merry Ryls;
                        he mischievously pulled the gray beards of the low-browed Knooks; he rested
                        his curly head confidently upon the dainty bosom of the Fairy Queen herself.
                        And the Ryls loved the sound of his laughter; the Knooks loved his courage;
                        the Fairies loved his innocence. </p>
                    <p>The boy made friends of them all, and learned to know their laws intimately.
                        No forest flower was trampled beneath his feet, lest the friendly Ryls
                        should be grieved. He never interfered with the beasts of the forest, lest
                        his friends the Knooks should become angry. The Fairies he loved dearly,
                        but, knowing nothing of mankind, he could not understand that he <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0050" n="21"/> was the only one of his race
                        admitted to friendly intercourse with them. </p>
                    <p>Indeed, Claus came to consider that he alone, of all the forest people, had
                        no like nor fellow. To him the forest was the world. He had no idea that
                        millions of toiling, striving human creatures existed. </p>
                    <p>And he was happy and content. </p>

                    <p> YEARS pass swiftly in Burzee, for the nymphs have no need to regard time in
                        any way. Even centuries make no change in the dainty creatures; ever and
                        ever they remain the same, immortal and unchanging. </p>
                    <p>Claus, however, being mortal, grew to manhood day by day. Necile was
                        disturbed, presently, to find him too big to lie in her lap, and he had a
                        desire for other food than milk. His stout legs carried him far into
                        Burzee's heart, where he gathered supplies of nuts and berries, as well as
                        several sweet and wholesome roots, which suited his stomach better than the
                        belludders. He sought Necile's bower less <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0052"
                            n="23"/> frequently, till finally it became his custom to return thither
                        only to sleep. </p>
                    <p>The nymph, who had come to love him dearly, was puzzled to comprehend the
                        changed nature of her charge, and unconsciously altered her own mode of life
                        to conform to his whims. She followed him readily through the forest paths,
                        as did many of her sister nymphs, explaining as they walked all the
                        mysteries of the gigantic wood and the habits and nature of the living
                        things which dwelt beneath its shade. </p>
                    <p>The language of the beasts became clear to little Claus; but he never could
                        understand their sulky and morose tempers. Only the squirrels, the mice and
                        the rabbits seemed to possess cheerful and merry natures; yet would the boy
                        laugh when the panther growled, and stroke the bear's glossy coat while the
                        creature snarled and bared its teeth menacingly. The growls and snarls were
                        not for Claus, he well knew, so what did they matter? </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0053" n="24"/>
                    <p>He could sing the songs of the bees, recite the poetry of the wood-flowers
                        and relate the history of every blinking owl in Burzee. He helped the Ryls
                        to feed their plants and the Knooks to keep order among the animals. The
                        little immortals regarded him as a privileged person, being especially
                        protected by Queen Zurline and her nymphs and favored by the great Ak
                        himself. </p>
                    <p>One day the Master Woodsman came back to the forest of Burzee. He had
                        visited, in turn, all his forests throughout the world, and they were many
                        and broad. </p>
                    <p>Not until he entered the glade where the Queen and her nymphs were assembled
                        to greet him did Ak remember the child he had permitted Necile to adopt.
                        Then he found, sitting familiarly in the circle of lovely immortals, a
                        broad-shouldered, stalwart youth, who, when erect, stood fully as high as
                        the shoulder of the Master himself. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0054" n="Illustration"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0055"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0056" n="25"/>
                    <p>Ak paused, silent and frowning, to bend his piercing gaze upon Claus. The
                        clear eyes met his own steadfastly, and the Woodsman gave a sigh of relief
                        as he marked their placid depths and read the youth's brave and innocent
                        heart. Nevertheless, as Ak sat beside the fair Queen, and the golden
                        chalice, filled with rare nectar, passed from lip to lip, the Master
                        Woodsman was strangely silent and reserved, and stroked his beard many times
                        with a thoughtful motion. </p>
                    <p>With morning he called Claus aside, in kindly fashion, saying: </p>
                    <p>"Bid good by, for a time, to Necile and her sisters; for you shall accompany
                        me on my journey through the world.'' </p>
                    <p>The venture pleased Claus, who knew well the honor of being companion of the
                        Master Woodsman of the world. But Necile wept for the first time in her
                        life, and clung to the boy's neck as if she could not bear to let him go.
                        The nymph who had mothered this sturdy <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0057"
                            n="26"/> youth was still as dainty, as charming and beautiful as when
                        she had dared to face Ak with the babe clasped to her breast; nor was her
                        love less great. Ak beheld the two clinging together, seemingly as brother
                        and sister to one another, and again he wore his thoughtful look. </p>

                    <head> CHAPTER SIXTH: Claus Discovers Humanity</head>
                    <p> TAKING Claus to a small clearing in the forest, the Master said: "Place your
                        hand upon my girdle and hold fast while we journey through the air; for now
                        shall we encircle the world and look upon many of the haunts of those men
                        from whom you are descended.'' </p>
                    <p>These words caused Claus to marvel, for until now he had thought himself the
                        only one of his kind upon the earth; yet in silence he grasped firmly the
                        girdle of the great Ak, his astonishment forbidding speech. </p>
                    <p>Then the vast forest of Burzee seemed to fall away from their feet, and the
                        youth found <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0059" n="28"/> himself passing
                        swiftly through the air at a great height. </p>
                    <p>Ere long there were spires beneath them, while buildings of many shapes and
                        colors met their downward view. It was a city of men, and Ak, pausing to
                        descend, led Claus to its inclosure. Said the Master: </p>
                    <p>"So long as you hold fast to my girdle you will remain unseen by all mankind,
                        though seeing clearly yourself. To release your grasp will be to separate
                        yourself forever from me and your home in Burzee.'' </p>
                    <p>One of the first laws of the Forest is obedience, and Claus had no thought of
                        disobeying the Master's wish. He clung fast to the girdle and remained
                        invisible. </p>
                    <p>Thereafter with each moment passed in the city the youth's wonder grew. He,
                        who had supposed himself created differently from all others, now found the
                        earth swarming with creatures of his own kind. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0060"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0061"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0062" n="29"/>
                    <p>"Indeed,'' said Ak, "the immortals are few; but the mortals are many.'' </p>
                    <p>Claus looked earnestly upon his fellows. There were sad faces, gay and
                        reckless faces, pleasant faces, anxious faces and kindly faces, all mingled
                        in puzzling disorder. Some worked at tedious tasks; some strutted in
                        impudent conceit; some were thoughtful and grave while others seemed happy
                        and content. Men of many natures were there, as everywhere, and Claus found
                        much to please him and much to make him sad. </p>
                    <p>But especially he noted the children&mdash;first curiously, then eagerly,
                        then lovingly. Ragged little ones rolled in the dust of the streets, playing
                        with scraps and pebbles. Other children, gaily dressed, were propped upon
                        cushions and fed with sugar-plums. Yet the children of the rich were not
                        happier than those playing with the dust and pebbles, it seemed to Claus. </p>
                    <p>"Childhood is the time of man's greatest <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0063"
                            n="30"/> content,'' said Ak, following the youth's thoughts. " 'Tis
                        during these years of innocent pleasure that the little ones are most free
                        from care.'' </p>
                    <p>"Tell me,'' said Claus, "why do not all these babies fare alike?'' </p>
                    <p>"Because they are born in both cottage and palace,'' returned the Master.
                        "The difference in the wealth of the parents determines the lot of the
                        child. Some are carefully tended and clothed in silks and dainty linen;
                        others are neglected and covered with rags.'' </p>
                    <p>"Yet all seem equally fair and sweet,'' said Claus, thoughtfully. </p>
                    <p>"While they are babes&mdash;yes;'' agreed Ak. "Their joy is in being
                        alive, and they do not stop to think. In after years the doom of mankind
                        overtakes them, and they find they must struggle and worry, work and fret,
                        to gain the wealth that is so dear to the hearts of men. Such things are
                        unknown in the Forest where <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0064" n="31"/> you
                        were reared.'' Claus was silent a moment. Then he asked: </p>
                    <p>"Why was I reared in the forest, among those who are not of my race?'' </p>
                    <p>Then Ak, in gentle voice, told him the story of his babyhood: how he had been
                        abandoned at the forest's edge and left a prey to wild beasts, and how the
                        loving nymph Necile had rescued him and brought him to manhood under the
                        protection of the immortals. </p>
                    <p>"Yet I am not of them,'' said Claus, musingly. </p>
                    <p>"You are not of them,'' returned the Woodsman. "The nymph who cared for you
                        as a mother seems now like a sister to you; by and by, when you grow old and
                        gray, she will seem like a daughter. Yet another brief span and you will be
                        but a memory, while she remains Necile.'' </p>
                    <p>"Then why, if man must perish, is he born?'' demanded the boy </p>
                    <p>"Everything perishes except the world itself <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0065"
                            n="32"/> and its keepers,'' answered Ak. "But while life lasts
                        everything on earth has its use. The wise seek ways to be helpful to the
                        world, for the helpful ones are sure to live again.'' </p>
                    <p>Much of this Claus failed to understand fully, but a longing seized him to
                        become helpful to his fellows, and he remained grave and thoughtful while
                        they resumed their journey </p>
                    <p>They visited many dwellings of men in many parts of the world, watching
                        farmers toil in the fields, warriors dash into cruel fray, and merchants
                        exchange their goods for bits of white and yellow metal. And everywhere the
                        eyes of Claus sought out the children in love and pity, for the thought of
                        his own helpless babyhood was strong within him and he yearned to give help
                        to the innocent little ones of his race even as he had been succored by the
                        kindly nymph. </p>
                    <p>Day by day the Master Woodsman and his pupil traversed the earth, Ak speaking
                        but seldom to the youth who clung steadfastly to his <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0066" n="33"/> girdle, but guiding him into all
                        places where he might become familiar with the lives of human beings. </p>
                    <p>And at last they returned to the grand old Forest of Burzee, where the Master
                        set Claus down within the circle of nymphs, among whom the pretty Necile
                        anxiously awaited him. </p>
                    <p>The brow of the great Ak was now calm and peaceful; but the brow of Claus had
                        become lined with deep thought. Necile sighed at the change in her
                        foster-son, who until now had been ever joyous and smiling, and the thought
                        came to her that never again would the life of the boy be the same as before
                        this eventful journey with the Master. </p>

                    <head> CHAPTER SEVENTH: Claus Leaves the Forest</head>
                    <p> WHEN good Queen Zurline had touched the golden chalice with her fair lips
                        and it had passed around the circle in honor of the travelers' return, the
                        Master Woodsman of the World, who had not yet spoken, turned his gaze
                        frankly upon Claus and said: </p>
                    <p>"Well?'' </p>
                    <p>The boy understood, and rose slowly to his feet beside Necile. Once only his
                        eyes passed around the familiar circle of nymphs, every one of whom he
                        remembered as a loving comrade; but tears came unbidden to dim his sight, so
                        he gazed thereafter steadfastly at the Master. </p>
                    <p>"I have been ignorant,'' said he, simply, <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0068"
                            n="35"/> "until the great Ak in his kindness taught me who and what I
                        am. You, who live so sweetly in your forest bowers, ever fair and youthful
                        and innocent, are no fit comrades for a son of humanity. For I have looked
                        upon man, finding him doomed to live for a brief space upon earth, to toil
                        for the things he needs, to fade into old age, and then to pass away as the
                        leaves in autumn. Yet every man has his mission, which is to leave the world
                        better, in some way, than he found it. I am of the race of men, and man's
                        lot is my lot. For your tender care of the poor, forsaken babe you adopted,
                        as well as for your loving comradeship during my boyhood, my heart will ever
                        overflow with gratitude. My foster-mother,'' here he stooped and kissed
                        Necile's white forehead, "I shall love and cherish while life lasts. But I
                        must leave you, to take my part in the endless struggle to which humanity is
                        doomed, and to live my life in my own way.'' </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0069" n="36"/>
                    <p>"What will you do?'' asked the Queen, gravely. </p>
                    <p>"I must devote myself to the care of the children of mankind, and try to make
                        them happy,'' he answered. "Since your own tender care of a babe brought to
                        me happiness and strength, it is just and right that I devote my life to the
                        pleasure of other babes. Thus will the memory of the loving nymph Necile be
                        planted within the hearts of thousands of my race for many years to come,
                        and her kindly act be recounted in song and in story while the world shall
                        last. Have I spoken well, O Master?'' </p>
                    <p>"You have spoken well,'' returned Ak, and rising to his feet he continued:
                        "Yet one thing must not be forgotten. Having been adopted as the child of
                        the Forest, and the playfellow of the nymphs, you have gained a distinction
                        which forever separates you from your kind. Therefore, when you go forth
                        into the world of men you shall retain the protection <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0070" n="37"/> of the Forest, and the powers you
                        now enjoy will remain with you to assist you in your labors. In any need you
                        may call upon the Nymphs, the Ryls, the Knooks and the Fairies, and they
                        will serve you gladly. I, the Master Woodsman of the World, have said it,
                        and my Word is the Law!'' </p>
                    <p>Claus looked upon Ak with grateful eyes. </p>
                    <p>"This will make me mighty among men,'' he replied. "Protected by these kind
                        friends I may be able to make thousands of little children happy. I will try
                        very hard to do my duty, and I know the Forest people will give me their
                        sympathy and help.'' </p>
                    <p>"We will!'' said the Fairy Queen, earnestly. </p>
                    <p>"We will!'' cried the merry Ryls, laughing. </p>
                    <p>"We will!'' shouted the crooked Knooks, scowling. </p>
                    <p>"We will!'' exclaimed the sweet nymphs, proudly. But Necile said nothing. She
                        only folded Claus in her arms and kissed him tenderly. </p>

                    <p>"The world is big,'' continued the boy, turning again to his loyal friends,
                        "but men are everywhere. I shall begin my work near my friends, so that if I
                        meet with misfortune I can come to the Forest for counsel or help.'' </p>
                    <p>With that he gave them all a loving look and turned away. There was no need
                        to say good by, but for him the sweet, wild life of the Forest was over. He
                        went forth bravely to meet his doom&mdash;the doom of the race of
                        man&mdash; the necessity to worry and work. </p>
                    <p>But Ak, who knew the boy's heart, was merciful and guided his steps. </p>
                    <p>Coming through Burzee to its eastern edge Claus reached the Laughing Valley
                        of Hohaho. On each side were rolling green hills, and a brook wandered
                        midway between them to wind afar off beyond the valley. At his back was the
                        grim Forest; at the far end of the valley a broad <pb

                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0074" n="39"/> plain. The eyes of the young man,
                        which had until now reflected his grave thoughts, became brighter as he
                        stood silent, looking out upon the Laughing Valley. Then on a sudden his
                        eyes twinkled, as stars do on a still night, and grew merry and wide. </p>

                    <p>For at his feet the cowslips and daisies smiled on him in friendly regard;
                        the breeze whistled gaily as it passed by and fluttered the locks on his
                        forehead; the brook laughed joyously as it leaped over the pebbles and swept
                        around the green curves of its banks; the bees sang sweet songs as they flew
                        from dandelion to daffodil; the beetles chirruped happily in the long grass,
                        and the sunbeams glinted pleasantly over all the scene. </p>
                    <p>"Here,'' cried Claus, stretching out his arms as if to embrace the Valley,
                        "will I make my home!'' </p>
                    <p>That was many, many years ago. It has been his home ever since. It is his
                        home now. </p>

                    <head> CHAPTER FIRST: The Laughing Valley</head>
                    <p> WHEN Claus came the Valley was empty save for the grass, the brook, the
                        wild-flowers, the bees and the butterflies. If he would make his home here
                        and live after the fashion of men he must have a house. This puzzled him at
                        first, but while he stood smiling in the sunshine he suddenly found beside
                        him old Nelko, the servant of the Master Woodsman. Nelko bore an ax, strong
                        and broad, with blade that gleamed like burnished silver. This he placed in
                        the young man's hand, then disappeared without a word. </p>
                    <p>Claus understood, and turning to the Forest's edge he selected a number of
                        fallen tree-trunks, <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0079" n="44"/> which he began
                        to clear of their dead branches. He would not cut into a living tree. His
                        life among the nymphs who guarded the Forest had taught him that a live tree
                        is sacred, being a created thing endowed with feeling. But with the dead and
                        fallen trees it was different. They had fulfilled their destiny, as active
                        members of the Forest community, and now it was fitting that their remains
                        should minister to the needs of man. </p>
                    <p>The ax bit deep into the logs at every stroke. It seemed to have a force of
                        its own, and Claus had but to swing and guide it. </p>
                    <p>When shadows began creeping over the green hills to lie in the Valley
                        overnight, the young man had chopped many logs into equal lengths and proper
                        shapes for building a house such as he had seen the poorer classes of men
                        inhabit. Then, resolving to await another day before he tried to fit the
                        logs together, Claus ate some of the sweet roots he well knew how to find,
                        drank <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0080" n="45"/> deeply from the laughing
                        brook, and lay down to sleep on the grass, first seeking a spot where no
                        flowers grew, lest the weight of his body should crush them. </p>
                    <p>And while he slumbered and breathed in the perfume of the wondrous Valley the
                        Spirit of Happiness crept into his heart and drove out all terror and care
                        and misgivings. Never more would the face of Claus be clouded with
                        anxieties; never more would the trials of life weigh him down as with a
                        burden. The Laughing Valley had claimed him for its own. </p>
                    <p>Would that we all might live in that delightful place!&mdash;but then,
                        maybe, it would become over-crowded. For ages it had awaited a tenant. Was
                        it chance that led young Claus to make his home in this happy vale? Or may
                        we guess that his thoughtful friends, the immortals, had directed his steps
                        when he wandered away from Burzee to seek a home in the great world? </p>
                    <p>Certain it is that while the moon peered over the <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0081" n="46"/> hilltop and flooded with its soft
                        beams the body of the sleeping stranger, the Laughing Valley was filled with
                        the queer, crooked shapes of the friendly Knooks. These people spoke no
                        words, but worked with skill and swiftness. The logs Claus had trimmed with
                        his bright ax were carried to a spot beside the brook and fitted one upon
                        another, and during the night a strong and roomy dwelling was built. </p>
                    <p>The birds came sweeping into the Valley at daybreak, and their songs, so
                        seldom heard in the deep wood, aroused the stranger. He rubbed the web of
                        sleep from his eyelids and looked around. The house met his gaze. </p>
                    <p>"I must thank the Knooks for this,'' said he, gratefully. Then he walked to
                        his dwelling and entered at the doorway. A large room faced him, having a
                        fireplace at the end and a table and bench in the middle. Beside the
                        fireplace was a cupboard. Another doorway was beyond. Claus entered here,
                        also, and saw a smaller <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0082" n="47"/> room with
                        a bed against the wall and a stool set near a small stand. On the bed were
                        many layers of dried moss brought from the Forest. </p>
                    <p>"Indeed, it is a palace!'' exclaimed the smiling Claus. "I must thank the
                        good Knooks again, for their knowledge of man's needs as well as for their
                        labors in my behalf.'' </p>
                    <p>He left his new home with a glad feeling that he was not quite alone in the
                        world, although he had chosen to abandon his Forest life. Friendships are
                        not easily broken, and the immortals are everywhere. </p>
                    <p>Upon reaching the brook he drank of the pure water, and then sat down on the
                        bank to laugh at the mischievous gambols of the ripples as they pushed one
                        another against rocks or crowded desperately to see which should first reach
                        the turn beyond. And as they raced away he listened to the song they sang:</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0083" n="48"/>


                    <lg type="verse">
                        <l>"Rushing, pushing, on we go!</l>
                        <l>Not a wave may gently flow&mdash;</l>
                        <l>All are too excited.</l>
                        <l>Ev'ry drop, delighted,</l>
                        <l>Turns to spray in merry play</l>
                        <l>As we tumble on our way!''</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>Next Claus searched for roots to eat, while the daffodils turned their little
                        eyes up to him laughingly and lisped their dainty song:</p>

                    <lg type="verse">
                        <l>"Blooming fairly, growing rarely,</l>
                        <l> Never flowerets were so gay!</l>
                        <l>Perfume breathing, joy bequeathing,</l>
                        <l>As our colors we display.''</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>It made Claus laugh to hear the little things voice their happiness as they
                        nodded gracefully on their stems. But another strain caught his ear as the
                        sunbeams fell gently across his face and whispered:</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0084" n="Illustration"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0085"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0086" n="49"/>

                    <lg type="verse">
                        <l>"Here is gladness, that our rays</l>
                        <l>Warm the Valley through the days;</l>
                        <l> Here is happiness, to give</l>
                        <l>Comfort unto all who live!''</l>
                    </lg>


                    <p>"Yes!'' cried Claus in answer, "there is happiness and joy in all things
                        here. The Laughing Valley is a valley of peace and good-will.'' </p>
                    <p>He passed the day talking with the ants and beetles and exchanging jokes with
                        the light-hearted butterflies. And at night he lay on his bed of soft moss
                        and slept soundly. </p>
                    <p>Then came the Fairies, merry but noiseless, bringing skillets and pots and
                        dishes and pans and all the tools necessary to prepare food and to comfort a
                        mortal. With these they filled cupboard and fireplace, finally placing a
                        stout suit of wool clothing on the stool by the bedside. </p>
                    <p>When Claus awoke he rubbed his eyes again, and laughed, and spoke aloud his
                        thanks to the <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0087" n="50"/> Fairies and the
                        Master Woodsman who had sent them. With eager joy he examined all his new
                        possessions, wondering what some might be used for. But, in the days when he
                        had clung to the girdle of the great Ak and visited the cities of men, his
                        eyes had been quick to note all the manners and customs of the race to which
                        he belonged; so he guessed from the gifts brought by the Fairies that the
                        Master expected him hereafter to live in the fashion of his
                        fellow-creatures. </p>
                    <p>"Which means that I must plow the earth and plant corn,'' he reflected; "so
                        that when winter comes I shall have garnered food in plenty.'' </p>
                    <p>But, as he stood in the grassy Valley, he saw that to turn up the earth in
                        furrows would be to destroy hundreds of pretty, helpless flowers, as well as
                        thousands of the tender blades of grass. And this he could not bear to do. </p>
                    <p>Therefore he stretched out his arms and <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0088"
                            n="51"/> uttered a peculiar whistle he had learned in the Forest,
                        afterward crying: </p>
                    <p>"Ryls of the Field Flowers&mdash;come to me!'' </p>
                    <p>Instantly a dozen of the queer little Ryls were squatting upon the ground
                        before him, and they nodded to him in cheerful greeting. </p>
                    <p>Claus gazed upon them earnestly. </p>
                    <p>"Your brothers of the Forest,'' he said, "I have known and loved many years.
                        I shall love you, also, when we have become friends. To me the laws of the
                        Ryls, whether those of the Forest or of the field, are sacred. I have never
                        wilfully destroyed one of the flowers you tend so carefully; but I must
                        plant grain to use for food during the cold winter, and how am I to do this
                        without killing the little creatures that sing to me so prettily of their
                        fragrant blossoms? </p>
                    <p>The Yellow Ryl, he who tends the buttercups, made answer: </p>
                    <p>"Fret not, friend Claus. The great Ak has <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0089"
                            n="52"/> spoken to us of you. There is better work for you in life than
                        to labor for food, and though, not being of the Forest, Ak has no command
                        over us, nevertheless are we glad to favor one he loves. Live, therefore, to
                        do the good work you are resolved to undertake. We, the Field Ryls, will
                        attend to your food supplies.'' </p>
                    <p>After this speech the Ryls were no longer to be seen, and Claus drove from
                        his mind the thought of tilling the earth. </p>
                    <p>When next he wandered back to his dwelling a bowl of fresh milk stood upon
                        the table; bread was in the cupboard and sweet honey filled a dish beside
                        it. A pretty basket of rosy apples and new-plucked grapes was also awaiting
                        him. He called out "Thanks, my friends!'' to the invisible Ryls, and
                        straightway began to eat of the food. </p>
                    <p>Thereafter, when hungry, he had but to look into the cupboard to find goodly
                        supplies brought by the kindly Ryls. And the Knooks <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0090" n="Illustration"/>

                        fireplace. And the Fairies brought him warm blankets and clothing. </p>
                    <p>So began his life in the Laughing Valley with the favor and friendship of the
                        immortals to minister to his every want. </p>

                    <head> CHAPTER SECOND: How Claus Made the First Toy</head>
                    <p> TRULY our Claus had wisdom, for his good fortune but strengthened his
                        resolve to befriend the little ones of his own race. He knew his plan was
                        approved by the immortals, else they would not have favored him so greatly. </p>
                    <p>So he began at once to make acquaintance with mankind. He walked through the
                        Valley to the plain beyond, and crossed the plain in many directions to
                        reach the abodes of men. These stood singly or in groups of dwellings called
                        villages, and in nearly all the houses, whether big or little, Claus found
                        children. </p>
                    <p>The youngsters soon came to know his merry, laughing face and the kind glance
                        of his bright <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0094" n="55"/> eyes; and the
                        parents, while they regarded the young man with some scorn for loving
                        children more than their elders, were content that the girls and boys had
                        found a playfellow who seemed willing to amuse them. </p>
                    <p>So the children romped and played games with Claus, and the boys rode upon
                        his shoulders, and the girls nestled in his strong arms, and the babies
                        clung fondly to his knees. Wherever the young man chanced to be, the sound
                        of childish laughter followed him; and to understand this better you must
                        know that children were much neglected in those days and received little
                        attention from their parents, so that it became to them a marvel that so
                        goodly a man as Claus devoted his time to making them happy. And those who
                        knew him were, you may be sure, very happy indeed. The sad faces of the poor
                        and abused grew bright for once; the cripple smiled despite his misfortune;
                        the ailing ones hushed their moans and the grieved <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0095" n="56"/> ones their cries when their merry
                        friend came nigh to comfort them. </p>
                    <p>Only at the beautiful palace of the Lord of Lerd and at the frowning castle
                        of the Baron Braun was Claus refused admittance. There were children at both
                        places; but the servants at the palace shut the door in the young stranger's
                        face, and the fierce Baron threatened to hang him from an iron hook on the
                        castle walls. Whereupon Claus sighed and went back to the poorer dwellings
                        where he was welcome. </p>
                    <p>After a time the winter drew near. </p>
                    <p>The flowers lived out their lives and faded and disappeared; the beetles
                        burrowed far into the warm earth; the butterflies deserted the meadows; and
                        the voice of the brook grew hoarse, as if it had taken cold. </p>
                    <p>One day snowflakes filled all the air in the Laughing Valley, dancing
                        boisterously toward the earth and clothing in pure white raiment the roof of
                        Claus's dwelling. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0096" n="57"/>
                    <p>At night Jack Frost rapped at the door. </p>
                    <p>"Come in!'' cried Claus. </p>
                    <p>"Come out!'' answered Jack, "for you have a fire inside. </p>
                    <p>So Claus came out. He had known Jack Frost in the Forest, and liked the jolly
                        rogue, even while he mistrusted him. </p>
                    <p>"There will be rare sport for me to-night, Claus!'' shouted the sprite.
                        "Isn't this glorious weather? I shall nip scores of noses and ears and toes
                        before daybreak.'' </p>
                    <p>"If you love me, Jack, spare the children,'' begged Claus. </p>
                    <p>"And why?'' asked the other, in surprise. </p>
                    <p>"They are tender and helpless,'' answered Claus. </p>
                    <p>"But I love to nip the tender ones!'' declared Jack. "The older ones are
                        tough, and tire my fingers.'' </p>
                    <p>"The young ones are weak, and can not fight you,'' said Claus. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0097" n="58"/>
                    <p>"True,'' agreed Jack, thoughtfully. "Well, I will not pinch a child this
                        night&mdash;if I can resist the temptation,'' he promised. "Good night,
                        Claus!'' </p>
                    <p>"Good night.'' </p>
                    <p>The young man went in and closed the door, and Jack Frost ran on to the
                        nearest village. </p>
                    <p>Claus threw a log on the fire, which burned up brightly. Beside the hearth
                        sat Blinkie, a big cat given him by Peter the Knook. Her fur was soft and
                        glossy, and she purred never-ending songs of contentment. </p>
                    <p>"I shall not see the children again soon,'' said Claus to the cat, who kindly
                        paused in her song to listen. "The winter is upon us, the snow will be deep
                        for many days, and I shall be unable to play with my little friends.'' </p>
                    <p>The cat raised a paw and stroked her nose thoughtfully, but made no reply. So
                        long as the fire burned and Claus sat in his easy chair by the hearth she
                        did not mind the weather. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0098" n="59"/>
                    <p>So passed many days and many long evenings. The cupboard was always full, but
                        Claus became weary with having nothing to do more than to feed the fire from
                        the big wood-pile the Knooks had brought him. </p>
                    <p>One evening he picked up a stick of wood and began to cut it with his sharp
                        knife. He had no thought, at first, except to occupy his time, and he
                        whistled and sang to the cat as he carved away portions of the stick. Puss
                        sat up on her haunches and watched him, listening at the same time to her
                        master's merry whistle, which she loved to hear even more than her own
                        purring songs. </p>
                    <p>Claus glanced at puss and then at the stick he was whittling, until presently
                        the wood began to have a shape, and the shape was like the head of a cat,
                        with two ears sticking upward. </p>
                    <p>Claus stopped whistling to laugh, and then both he and the cat looked at the
                        wooden image in some surprise. Then he carved out the eyes <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0099" n="60"/> and the nose, and rounded the
                        lower part of the head so that it rested upon a neck. </p>
                    <p>Puss hardly knew what to make of it now, and sat up stiffly, as if watching
                        with some suspicion what would come next. </p>
                    <p>Claus knew. The head gave him an idea. He plied his knife carefully and with
                        skill, forming slowly the body of the cat, which he made to sit upon its
                        haunches as the real cat did, with her tail wound around her two front legs. </p>
                    <p>The work cost him much time, but the evening was long and he had nothing
                        better to do. Finally he gave a loud and delighted laugh at the result of
                        his labors and placed the wooden cat, now completed, upon the hearth
                        opposite the real one. </p>
                    <p>Puss thereupon glared at her image, raised her hair in anger, and uttered a
                        defiant mew. The wooden cat paid no attention, and Claus, much amused,
                        laughed again. </p>
                    <p>Then Blinkie advanced toward the wooden <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0100"
                            n="Illustration"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0101"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0102" n="61"/> image to eye it closely and smell
                        of it intelligently: Eyes and nose told her the creature was wood, in spite
                        of its natural appearance; so puss resumed her seat and her purring, but as
                        she neatly washed her face with her padded paw she cast more than one
                        admiring glance at her clever master. Perhaps she felt the same satisfaction
                        we feel when we look upon good photographs of ourselves. </p>
                    <p>The cat's master was himself pleased with his handiwork, without knowing
                        exactly why. Indeed, he had great cause to congratulate himself that night,
                        and all the children throughout the world should have joined him in
                        rejoicing. For Claus had made his first toy. </p>

                    <head> CHAPTER THIRD: How the Ryls Colored the Toys</head>
                    <p> A HUSH lay on the Laughing Valley now. Snow covered it like a white spread
                        and pillows of downy flakes drifted before the dwelling where Claus sat
                        feeding the blaze of the fire. The brook gurgled on beneath a heavy sheet of
                        ice and all living plants and insects nestled close to Mother Earth to keep
                        warm. The face of the moon was hid by dark clouds, and the wind, delighting
                        in the wintry sport, pushed and whirled the snowflakes in so many directions
                        that they could get no chance to fall to the ground. </p>
                    <p>Claus heard the wind whistling and shrieking in its play and thanked the good
                        Knooks again for his comfortable shelter. Blinkie washed her <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0104" n="63"/> face lazily and stared at the
                        coals with a look of perfect content. The toy cat sat opposite the real one
                        and gazed straight ahead, as toy cats should. </p>
                    <p>Suddenly Claus heard a noise that sounded different from the voice of the
                        wind. It was more like a wail of suffering and despair. </p>
                    <p>He stood up and listened, but the wind, growing boisterous, shook the door
                        and rattled the windows to distract his attention. He waited until the wind
                        was tired and then, still listening, he heard once more the shrill cry of
                        distress. </p>
                    <p>Quickly he drew on his coat, pulled his cap over his eyes and opened the
                        door. The wind dashed in and scattered the embers over the hearth, at the
                        same time blowing Blinkie's fur so furiously that she crept under the table
                        to escape. Then the door was closed and Claus was outside, peering anxiously
                        into the darkness. </p>
                    <p>The wind laughed and scolded and tried to <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0105"
                            n="64"/> push him over, but he stood firm. The helpless flakes stumbled
                        against his eyes and dimmed his sight, but he rubbed them away and looked
                        again. Snow was everywhere, white and glittering. It covered the earth and
                        filled the air. </p>
                    <p>The cry was not repeated. </p>
                    <p>Claus turned to go back into the house, but the wind caught him unawares and
                        he stumbled and fell across a snowdrift. His hand plunged into the drift and
                        touched something that was not snow. This he seized and, pulling it gently
                        toward him, found it to be a child. The next moment he had lifted it in his
                        arms and carried it into the house. </p>
                    <p>The wind followed him through the door, but Claus shut it out quickly. He
                        laid the rescued child on the hearth, and brushing away the snow he
                        discovered it to be Weekum, a little boy who lived in a house beyond the
                        Valley. </p>
                    <p>Claus wrapped a warm blanket around the little one and rubbed the frost from
                        his limbs. <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0106" n="65"/> Before long the child
                        opened his eyes and, seeing where he was, smiled happily. Then Claus warmed
                        milk and fed it to the boy slowly, while the cat looked on with sober
                        curiosity. Finally the little one curled up in his friend's arms and sighed
                        and fell asleep, and Claus, filled with gladness that he had found the
                        wanderer, held him closely while he slumbered. </p>
                    <p>The wind, finding no more mischief to do, climbed the hill and swept on
                        toward the north. This gave the weary snowflakes time to settle down to
                        earth, and the Valley became still again. </p>
                    <p>The boy, having slept well in the arms of his friend, opened his eyes and sat
                        up. Then, as a child will, he looked around the room and saw all that it
                        contained. </p>
                    <p>"Your cat is a nice cat, Claus,'' he said, at last. "Let me hold it.'' </p>
                    <p>But puss objected and ran away. </p>
                    <p>"The other cat won't run, Claus,'' continued the boy. "Let me hold that
                        one.'' Claus placed <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0107" n="66"/> the toy in his
                        arms, and the boy held it lovingly and kissed the tip of its wooden ear. </p>
                    <p>"How did you get lost in the storm, Weekum?'' asked Claus. </p>
                    <p>"I started to walk to my auntie's house and lost my way,'' answered Weekum. </p>
                    <p>"Were you frightened?'' </p>
                    <p>"It was cold,'' said Weekum, "and the snow got in my eyes, so I could not
                        see. Then I kept on till I fell in the snow, without knowing where I was,
                        and the wind blew the flakes over me and covered me up.'' </p>
                    <p>Claus gently stroked his head, and the boy looked up at him and smiled. </p>
                    <p>"I'm all right now,'' said Weekum. </p>
                    <p>"Yes,'' replied Claus, happily. "Now I will put you in my warm bed, and you
                        must sleep until morning, when I will carry you back to your mother.'' </p>
                    <p>"May the cat sleep with me?'' asked the boy. </p>
                    <p>"Yes, if you wish it to,'' answered Claus. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0108" n="67"/>
                    <p>"It's a nice cat!'' Weekum said, smiling, as Claus tucked the blankets around
                        him; and presently the little one fell asleep with the wooden toy in his
                        arms. </p>
                    <p>When morning came the sun claimed the Laughing Valley and flooded it with his
                        rays; so Claus prepared to take the lost child back to its mother. </p>
                    <p>"May I keep the cat, Claus?'' asked Weekum. "It's nicer than real cats. It
                        doesn't run away, or scratch or bite. May I keep it?'' </p>
                    <p>"Yes, indeed,'' answered Claus, pleased that the toy he had made could give
                        pleasure to the child. So he wrapped the boy and the wooden cat in a warm
                        cloak, perching the bundle upon his own broad shoulders, and then he tramped
                        through the snow and the drifts of the Valley and across the plain beyond to
                        the poor cottage where Weekum's mother lived. </p>
                    <p>"See, mama!'' cried the boy, as soon as they entered, "I've got a cat!'' </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0109" n="68"/>
                    <p>The good woman wept tears of joy over the rescue of her darling and thanked
                        Claus many times for his kind act. So he carried a warm and happy heart back
                        to his home in the Valley. </p>
                    <p>That night he said to puss: "I believe the children will love the wooden cats
                        almost as well as the real ones, and they can't hurt them by pulling their
                        tails and ears. I'll make another.'' </p>
                    <p>So this was the beginning of his great work. </p>
                    <p>The next cat was better made than the first. While Claus sat whittling it out
                        the Yellow Ryl came in to make him a visit, and so pleased was he with the
                        man's skill that he ran away and brought several of his fellows. </p>
                    <p>There sat the Red Ryl, the Black Ryl, the Green Ryl, the Blue Ryl and the
                        Yellow Ryl in a circle on the floor, while Claus whittled and whistled and
                        the wooden cat grew into shape. </p>
                    <p>"If it could be made the same color as the real cat, no one would know the
                        difference,'' said the Yellow Ryl, thoughtfully. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0110" n="Illustration"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0111"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0112" n="69"/>


                    <p>"The little ones, maybe, would not know the difference,'' replied Claus,
                        pleased with the idea. </p>
                    <p>"I will bring you some of the red that I color my roses and tulips with,''
                        cried the Red Ryl; "and then you can make the cat's lips and tongue red.'' </p>
                    <p>"I will bring some of the green that I color my grasses and leaves with,''
                        said the Green Ryl; "and then you can color the cat's eyes green.'' </p>
                    <p>"They will need a bit of yellow, also,'' remarked the Yellow Ryl; "I must
                        fetch some of the yellow that I use to color my buttercups and goldenrods
                        with.'' </p>
                    <p>"The real cat is black,'' said the Black Ryl; "I will bring some of the black
                        that I use to color the eyes of my pansies with, and then you can paint your
                        wooden cat black.'' </p>
                    <p>"I see you have a blue ribbon around Blinkie's neck,'' added the Blue Ryl. "I
                        will get some of the color that I use to paint the <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0113" n="70"/> bluebells and forget-me-nots with,
                        and then you can carve a wooden ribbon on the toy cat's neck and paint it
                        blue.'' </p>
                    <p>So the Ryls disappeared, and by the time Claus had finished carving out the
                        form of the cat they were all back with the paints and brushes. </p>
                    <p>They made Blinkie sit upon the table, that Claus might paint the toy cat just
                        the right color, and when the work was done the Ryls declared it was exactly
                        as good as a live cat. </p>
                    <p>"That is, to all appearances,'' added the Red Ryl. </p>
                    <p>Blinkie seemed a little offended by the attention bestowed upon the toy, and
                        that she might not seem to approve the imitation cat she walked to the
                        corner of the hearth and sat down with a dignified air. </p>
                    <p>But Claus was delighted, and as soon as morning came he started out and
                        tramped through the snow, across the Valley and the plain, until <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0114" n="71"/> he came to a village. There, in a
                        poor hut near the walls of the beautiful palace of the Lord of Lerd, a
                        little girl lay upon a wretched cot, moaning with pain. </p>
                    <p>Claus approached the child and kissed her and comforted her, and then he drew
                        the toy cat from beneath his coat, where he had hidden it, and placed it in
                        her arms. </p>
                    <p>Ah, how well he felt himself repaid for his labor and his long walk when he
                        saw the little one's eyes grow bright with pleasure! She hugged the kitty
                        tight to her breast, as if it had been a precious gem, and would not let it
                        go for a single moment. The fever was quieted, the pain grew less, and she
                        fell into a sweet and refreshing sleep. </p>
                    <p>Claus laughed and whistled and sang all the way home. Never had he been so
                        happy as on that day. </p>
                    <p>When he entered his house he found Shiegra, the lioness, awaiting him. Since
                        his babyhood <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0115" n="72"/> Shiegra had loved
                        Claus, and while he dwelt in the Forest she had often come to visit him at
                        Necile's bower. After Claus had gone to live in the Laughing Valley Shiegra
                        became lonely and ill at ease, and now she had braved the snow-drifts, which
                        all lions abhor, to see him once more. Shiegra was getting old and her teeth
                        were beginning to fall out, while the hairs that tipped her ears and tail
                        had changed from tawny-yellow to white. </p>
                    <p>Claus found her lying on his hearth, and he put his arms around the neck of
                        the lioness and hugged her lovingly. The cat had retired into a far corner.
                        She did not care to associate with Shiegra. </p>
                    <p>Claus told his old friend about the cats he had made, and how much pleasure
                        they had given Weekum and the sick girl. Shiegra did not know much about
                        children; indeed, if she met a child she could scarcely be trusted not to
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0116" n="73"/> devour it. But she was
                        interested in Claus new labors, and said: </p>
                    <p>"These images seem to me very attractive. Yet I can not see why you should
                        make cats, which are very unimportant animals. Suppose, now that I am here,
                        you make the image of a lioness, the Queen of all beasts. Then, indeed, your
                        children will be happy&mdash;and safe at the same time!'' </p>
                    <p>Claus thought this was a good suggestion. So he got a piece of wood and
                        sharpened his knife, while Shiegra crouched upon the hearth at his feet.
                        With much care he carved the head in the likeness of the lioness, even to
                        the two fierce teeth that curved over her lower lip and the deep, frowning
                        lines above her wide-open eyes. </p>
                    <p>When it was finished he said: </p>
                    <p>"You have a terrible look, Shiegra.'' </p>
                    <p>"Then the image is like me,'' she answered; "for I am indeed terrible to all
                        who are not my friends.'' </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0117" n="74"/>
                    <p>Claus now carved out the body, with Shiegra's long tail trailing behind it.
                        The image of the crouching lioness was very life-like. </p>
                    <p>"It pleases me,'' said Shiegra, yawning and stretching her body gracefully.
                        "Now I will watch while you paint.'' </p>
                    <p>He brought the paints the Ryls had given him from the cupboard and colored
                        the image to resemble the real Shiegra. </p>
                    <p>The lioness placed her big, padded paws upon the edge of the table and raised
                        herself while she carefully examined the toy that was her likeness. </p>
                    <p>"You are indeed skillful!'' she said, proudly. "The children will like that
                        better than cats, I'm sure.'' </p>
                    <p>Then snarling at Blinkie, who arched her back in terror and whined fearfully,
                        she walked away toward her forest home with stately strides. </p>

                    <head> CHAPTER FOURTH: How Little Mayrie Became Frightened</head>
                    <p> THE winter was over now, and all the Laughing Valley was filled with joyous
                        excitement. The brook was so happy at being free once again that it gurgled
                        more boisterously than ever and dashed so recklessly against the rocks that
                        it sent showers of spray high in the air. The grass thrust its sharp little
                        blades upward through the mat of dead stalks where it had hidden from the
                        snow, but the flowers were yet too timid to show themselves, although the
                        Ryls were busy feeding their roots. The sun was in remarkably good humor,
                        and sent his rays dancing merrily throughout the Valley. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0119" n="76"/>
                    <p>Claus was eating his dinner one day when he heard a timid knock on his door. </p>
                    <p>"Come in!'' he called. </p>
                    <p>No one entered, but after a pause came another rapping. </p>
                    <p>Claus jumped up and threw open the door. Before him stood a small girl
                        holding a smaller brother fast by the hand. </p>
                    <p>"Is you Tlaus?'' she asked, shyly. </p>
                    <p>"Indeed I am, my dear!'' he answered, with a laugh, as he caught both
                        children in his arms and kissed them. "You are very welcome, and you have
                        come just in time to share my dinner.'' </p>
                    <p>He took them to the table and fed them with fresh milk and nut-cakes. When
                        they had eaten enough he asked: </p>
                    <p>"Why have you made this long journey to see me?'' </p>
                    <p>"I wants a tat!'' replied little Mayrie; and her brother, who had not yet
                        learned to speak <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0120" n="Illustration"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0121"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0122" n="77"/> many words, nodded his head and
                        exclaimed like an echo: "Tat!'' </p>

                    <p>"Oh, you want my toy cats, do you?'' returned Claus, greatly pleased to
                        discover that his creations were so popular with children. </p>
                    <p>The little visitors nodded eagerly. </p>
                    <p>"Unfortunately,'' he continued, "I have but one cat now ready, for I carried
                        two to children in the town yesterday. And the one I have shall be given to
                        your brother, Mayrie, because he is the smaller; and the next one I make
                        shall be for you.'' </p>
                    <p>The boy's face was bright with smiles as he took the precious toy Claus held
                        out to him; but little Mayrie covered her face with her arm and began to sob
                        grievously. </p>
                    <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I wants a t&mdash;t&mdash;tat now!'' she
                        wailed. </p>
                    <p>Her disappointment made Claus feel miserable for a moment. Then he suddenly
                        remembered Shiegra. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0123" n="78"/>
                    <p>"Don't cry, darling!'' he said, soothingly; "I have a toy much nicer than a
                        cat, and you shall have that.'' </p>
                    <p>He went to the cupboard and drew out the image of the lioness, which he
                        placed on the table before Mayrie. </p>
                    <p>The girl raised her arm and gave one glance at the fierce teeth and glaring
                        eyes of the beast, and then, uttering a terrified scream, she rushed from
                        the house. The boy followed her, also screaming lustily, and even dropping
                        his precious cat in his fear. </p>
                    <p>For a moment Claus stood motionless, being puzzled and astonished. Then he
                        threw Shiegra's image into the cupboard and ran after the children, calling
                        to them not to be frightened. </p>
                    <p>Little Mayrie stopped in her flight and her brother clung to her skirt; but
                        they both cast fearful glances at the house until Claus had assured them
                        many times that the beast had been locked in the cupboard. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0124" n="79"/>
                    <p>"Yet why were you frightened at seeing it?'' he asked. "It is only a toy to
                        play with!'' </p>
                    <p>"It's bad!'' said Mayrie, decidedly, "an'&mdash; an'&mdash;just
                        horrid, an' not a bit nice, like tats!'' </p>
                    <p>"Perhaps you are right,'' returned Claus, thoughtfully. "But if you will
                        return with me to the house I will soon make you a pretty cat.' </p>
                    <p>So they timidly entered the house again having faith in their friend's words;
                        and afterward they had the joy of watching Claus carve out a cat from a bit
                        of wood and paint it in natural colors. It did not take him long to do this,
                        for he had become skillful with his knife by this time, and Mayrie loved her
                        toy the more dearly because she had seen it made. </p>
                    <p>After his little visitors had trotted away on their journey homeward Claus
                        sat long in deep thought. And he then decided that such fierce creatures as
                        his friend the lioness would never do as models from which to fashion his
                        toys. </p>
                    <p>"There must be nothing to frighten the dear <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0125"
                            n="80"/> babies,'' he reflected; "and while I know Shiegra well, and am
                        not afraid of her, it is but natural that children should look upon her
                        image with terror. Hereafter I will choose such mild-mannered animals as
                        squirrels and rabbits and deer and lambkins from which to carve my toys, for
                        then the little ones will love rather than fear them.'' </p>
                    <p>He began his work that very day, and before bedtime had made a wooden rabbit
                        and a lamb. They were not quite so lifelike as the cats had been, because
                        they were formed from memory, while Blinkie had sat very still for Claus to
                        look at while he worked. </p>
                    <p>But the new toys pleased the children nevertheless, and the fame of Claus'
                        playthings quickly spread to every cottage on plain and in village. He
                        always carried his gifts to the sick or crippled children, but those who
                        were strong enough walked to the house in the Valley to ask for them, so a
                        little path was soon worn from the plain to the door of the toy-maker's
                        cottage. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0126" n="81"/>
                    <p>First came the children who had been playmates of Claus, before he began to
                        make toys. These, you may be sure, were well supplied. Then children who
                        lived farther away heard of the wonderful images and made journeys to the
                        Valley to secure them. All little ones were welcome, and never a one went
                        away empty-handed. </p>
                    <p>This demand for his handiwork kept Claus busily occupied, but he was quite
                        happy in knowing the pleasure he gave to so many of the dear children. His
                        friends the immortals were pleased with his success and supported him
                        bravely. </p>
                    <p>The Knooks selected for him clear pieces of soft wood, that his knife might
                        not be blunted in cutting them; the Ryls kept him supplied with paints of
                        all colors and brushes fashioned from the tips of timothy grasses; the
                        Fairies discovered that the workman needed saws and chisels and hammers and
                        nails, as well as <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0127" n="82"/> knives, and
                        brought him a goodly array of such tools. </p>
                    <p>Claus soon turned his living room into a most wonderful workshop. He built a
                        bench before the window, and arranged his tools and paints so that he could
                        reach everything as he sat on his stool. And as he finished toy after toy to
                        delight the hearts of little children he found himself growing so gay and
                        happy that he could not refrain from singing and laughing and whistling all
                        the day long. </p>
                    <p>"It's because I live in the Laughing Valley, where everything else laughs!''
                        said Claus. </p>
                    <p>But that was not the reason. </p>

                    <head> CHAPTER FIFTH: How Bessie Blithesome Came to the Laughing Valley</head>
                    <p> ONE day, as Claus sat before his door to enjoy the sunshine while he busily
                        carved the head and horns of a toy deer, he looked up and discovered a
                        glittering cavalcade of horsemen approaching through the Valley. </p>
                    <p>When they drew nearer he saw that the band consisted of a score of
                        men-at-arms, clad in bright armor and bearing in their hands spears and
                        battle-axes. In front of these rode little Bessie Blithesome, the pretty
                        daughter of that proud Lord of Lerd who had once driven Claus from his
                        palace. Her palfrey was pure white, its bridle was covered with glittering
                        gems, and its saddle draped with cloth of gold, richly <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0129" n="84"/> broidered. The soldiers were sent
                        to protect her from harm while she journeyed. </p>
                    <p>Claus was surprised, but he continued to whittle and to sing until the
                        cavalcade drew up before him. Then the little girl leaned over the neck of
                        her palfrey and said: </p>
                    <p>"Please, Mr. Claus, I want a toy!'' </p>
                    <p>Her voice was so pleading that Claus jumped up at once and stood beside her.
                        But he was puzzled how to answer her request. </p>
                    <p>"You are a rich lord's daughter,'' said he, "and have all that you desire.'' </p>
                    <p>"Except toys,'' added Bessie. "There are no toys in all the world but
                        yours.'' </p>
                    <p>"And I make them for the poor children, who have nothing else to amuse
                        them,'' continued Claus. </p>
                    <p>"Do poor children love to play with toys more than rich ones?'' asked Bessie. </p>
                    <p>"I suppose not,'' said Claus, thoughtfully. </p>

                    <p>"Am I to blame because my father is a lord? <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0130"
                            n="Illustration"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0131"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0132" n="85"/> Must I be denied the pretty toys I
                        long for because other children are poorer than I?'' she inquired,
                        earnestly. </p>
                    <p>"I'm afraid you must, dear,'' he answered; "for the poor have nothing else
                        with which to amuse themselves. You have your pony to ride, your servants to
                        wait on you, and every comfort that money can procure.'' </p>
                    <p>"But I want toys!'' cried Bessie, wiping away the tears that forced
                        themselves into her eyes. "If I can not have them I shall be very unhappy.'' </p>
                    <p>Claus was troubled, for her grief recalled to him the thought that his desire
                        was to make all children happy, without regard to their condition in life.
                        Yet, while so many poor children were clamoring for his toys he could not
                        bear to give one of them to Bessie Blithesome, who had so much already to
                        make her happy. </p>
                    <p>"Listen, my child,'' said he, gently; "all the toys I am now making are
                        promised to others. <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0133" n="86"/> But the next
                        shall be yours, since your heart so longs for it. Come to me again in two
                        days and it shall be ready for you.'' </p>
                    <p>Bessie gave a cry of delight, and leaning over her pony's neck she kissed
                        Claus prettily upon his forehead. Then, calling to her men-at-arms, she rode
                        gaily away, leaving Claus to resume his work. </p>
                    <p>"If I am to supply the rich children as well as the poor ones,'' he thought,
                        "I shall not have a spare moment in the whole year! But is it right I should
                        give to the rich? Surely I must go to Necile and talk with her about this
                        matter.'' </p>
                    <p>So when he had finished the toy deer, which was very like a deer he had known
                        in the Forest glades, he walked into Burzee and made his way to the bower of
                        the beautiful Nymph Necile, who had been his foster mother. </p>
                    <p>She greeted him tenderly and lovingly, listening with interest to his story
                        of the visit of Bessie Blithesome. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0134" n="87"/>
                    <p>"And now tell me,'' said he, "shall I give toys to rich children?'' </p>
                    <p>"We of the Forest know nothing of riches,'' she replied. "It seems to me that
                        one child is like another child, since they are all made of the same clay,
                        and that riches are like a gown, which may be put on or taken away, leaving
                        the child unchanged. But the Fairies are guardians of mankind, and know
                        mortal children better than I. Let us call the Fairy Queen.'' </p>
                    <p>This was done, and the Queen of the Fairies sat beside them and heard Claus
                        relate his reasons for thinking the rich children could get along without
                        his toys, and also what the Nymph had said. </p>
                    <p>"Necile is right,'' declared the Queen; "for, whether it be rich or poor, a
                        child's longings for pretty playthings are but natural. Rich Bessie's heart
                        may suffer as much grief as poor Mayrie's; she can be just as lonely and
                        discontented, and just as gay and happy. I think, <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0135" n="88"/> friend Claus, it is your duty to
                        make all little ones glad, whether they chance to live in palaces or in
                        cottages.'' </p>
                    <p>"Your words are wise, fair Queen,'' replied Claus, "and my heart tells me
                        they are as just as they are wise. Hereafter all children may claim my
                        services.'' </p>
                    <p>Then he bowed before the gracious Fairy and, kissing Necile's red lips, went
                        back into his Valley. </p>
                    <p>At the brook he stopped to drink, and afterward he sat on the bank and took a
                        piece of moist clay in his hands while he thought what sort of toy he should
                        make for Bessie Blithesome. He did not notice that his fingers were working
                        the clay into shape until, glancing downward, he found he had unconsciously
                        formed a head that bore a slight resemblance to the Nymph Necile! </p>
                    <p>At once he became interested. Gathering more of the clay from the bank he
                        carried it to <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0136" n="89"/> his house. Then,
                        with the aid of his knife and a bit of wood he succeeded in working the clay
                        into the image of a toy nymph. With skillful strokes he formed long, waving
                        hair on the head and covered the body with a gown of oakleaves, while the
                        two feet sticking out at the bottom of the gown were clad in sandals. </p>
                    <p>But the clay was soft, and Claus found he must handle it gently to avoid
                        ruining his pretty work. </p>
                    <p>"Perhaps the rays of the sun will draw out the moisture and cause the clay to
                        become hard,'' he thought. So he laid the image on a flat board and placed
                        it in the glare of the sun. </p>
                    <p>This done, he went to his bench and began painting the toy deer, and soon he
                        became so interested in the work that he forgot all about the clay nymph.
                        But next morning, happening to notice it as it lay on the board, he found
                        the sun had baked it to the hardness of stone, and it was strong enough to
                        be safely handled. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0137" n="90"/>
                    <p>Claus now painted the nymph with great care in the likeness of Necile, giving
                        it deep-blue eyes, white teeth, rosy lips and ruddy-brown hair. The gown he
                        colored oak-leaf green, and when the paint was dry Claus himself was charmed
                        with the new toy. Of course it was not nearly so lovely as the real Necile;
                        but, considering the material of which it was made, Claus thought it was
                        very beautiful. </p>
                    <p>When Bessie, riding upon her white palfrey, came to his dwelling next day,
                        Claus presented her with the new toy. The little girl's eyes were brighter
                        than ever as she examined the pretty image, and she loved it at once, and
                        held it close to her breast, as a mother does her child. </p>
                    <p>"What is it called, Claus?'' she asked. </p>
                    <p>Now Claus knew that Nymphs do not like to be spoken of by mortals, so he
                        could not tell Bessie it was an image of Necile he had given her. But as it
                        was a new toy he searched his mind for a new name to call it by, and the
                        first <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0138" n="91"/> word he thought of he
                        decided would do very well. </p>
                    <p>"It is called a dolly, my dear,'' he said to Bessie. </p>
                    <p>"I shall call the dolly my baby,'' returned Bessie, kissing it fondly; "and I
                        shall tend it and care for it just as Nurse cares for me. Thank you very
                        much, Claus; your gift has made me happier than I have ever been before!'' </p>
                    <p>Then she rode away, hugging the toy in her arms, and Claus, seeing her
                        delight, thought he would make another dolly, better and more natural than
                        the first. </p>
                    <p>He brought more clay from the brook, and remembering that Bessie had called
                        the dolly her baby he resolved to form this one into a baby's image. That
                        was no difficult task to the clever workman, and soon the baby dolly was
                        lying on the board and placed in the sun to dry. Then, with the clay that
                        was left, he <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0139" n="92"/> began to make an
                        image of Bessie Blithesome herself. </p>
                    <p>This was not so easy, for he found he could not make the silken robe of the
                        lord's daughter out of the common clay. So he called the Fairies to his aid,
                        and asked them to bring him colored silks with which to make a real dress
                        for the clay image. The Fairies set off at once on their errand, and before
                        nightfall they returned with a generous supply of silks and laces and golden
                        threads. </p>
                    <p>Claus now became impatient to complete his new dolly, and instead of waiting
                        for the next day's sun he placed the clay image upon his hearth and covered
                        it over with glowing coals. By morning, when he drew the dolly from the
                        ashes, it had baked as hard as if it had lain a full day in the hot sun. </p>

                    <p>Now our Claus became a dressmaker as well as a toymaker. He cut the lavender
                        silk, and neatly sewed it into a beautiful gown that just <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0140" n="Illustration"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0141"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0142" n="93"/> fitted the new dolly. And he put a
                        lace collar around its neck and pink silk shoes on its feet. The natural
                        color of baked clay is a light gray, but Claus painted the face to resemble
                        the color of flesh, and he gave the dolly Bessie's brown eyes and golden
                        hair and rosy cheeks. </p>
                    <p>It was really a beautiful thing to look upon, and sure to bring joy to some
                        childish heart. While Claus was admiring it he heard a knock at his door,
                        and little Mayrie entered. Her face was sad and her eyes red with continued
                        weeping. </p>
                    <p>"Why, what has grieved you, my dear?'' asked Claus, taking the child in his
                        arms. </p>
                    <p>"I've&mdash;I've bwoke my tat!'' sobbed Mayrie. </p>
                    <p>"How?'' he inquired, his eyes twinkling. </p>
                    <p>"I&mdash;I dwopped him, an' bwoke off him's tail;
                        an'&mdash;an'&mdash;then I dwopped him an' bwoke off him's ear!
                        An'&mdash;an' now him's all spoilt!'' </p>
                    <p>Claus laughed. </p>
                    <p>"Never mind, Mayrie dear,'' he said. "How <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0143"
                            n="94"/> would you like this new dolly, instead of a cat?'' </p>
                    <p>Mayrie looked at the silk-robed dolly and her eyes grew big with
                        astonishment. </p>
                    <p>"Oh, Tlaus!'' she cried, clapping her small hands together with rapture; "tan
                        I have 'at boo'ful lady?'' </p>
                    <p>"Do you like it?'' he asked. </p>
                    <p>"I love it!'' said she. "It's better 'an tats!'' </p>
                    <p>"Then take it, dear, and be careful not to break it.'' </p>
                    <p>Mayrie took the dolly with a joy that was almost reverent, and her face
                        dimpled with smiles as she started along the path toward home. </p>

                    <p> I MUST now tell you something about the Awgwas, that terrible race of
                        creatures which caused our good Claus so much trouble and nearly succeeded
                        in robbing the children of the world of their earliest and best friend. </p>
                    <p>I do not like to mention the Awgwas, but they are a part of this history, and
                        can not be ignored. They were neither mortals nor immortals, but stood
                        midway between those classes of beings. The Awgwas were invisible to
                        ordinary people, but not to immortals. They could pass swiftly through the
                        air from one part of the world to another, and had the power of <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0145" n="96"/> influencing the minds of human
                        beings to do their wicked will. </p>
                    <p>They were of gigantic stature and had coarse, scowling countenances which
                        showed plainly their hatred of all mankind. They possessed no consciences
                        whatever and delighted only in evil deeds. </p>
                    <p>Their homes were in rocky, mountainous places, from whence they sallied forth
                        to accomplish their wicked purposes. </p>
                    <p>The one of their number that could think of the most horrible deed for them
                        to do was always elected the King Awgwa, and all the race obeyed his orders.
                        Sometimes these creatures lived to become a hundred years old, but usually
                        they fought so fiercely among themselves that many were destroyed in combat,
                        and when they died that was the end of them. Mortals were powerless to harm
                        them and the immortals shuddered when the Awgwas were mentioned, and always
                        avoided them. So they <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0146" n="97"/> flourished
                        for many years unopposed and accomplished much evil. </p>
                    <p>I am glad to assure you that these vile creatures have long since perished
                        and passed from earth; but in the days when Claus was making his first toys
                        they were a numerous and powerful tribe. </p>
                    <p>One of the principal sports of the Awgwas was to inspire angry passions in
                        the hearts of little children, so that they quarreled and fought with one
                        another. They would tempt boys to eat of unripe fruit, and then delight in
                        the pain they suffered; they urged little girls to disobey their parents,
                        and then would laugh when the children were punished. I do not know what
                        causes a child to be naughty in these days, but when the Awgwas were on
                        earth naughty children were usually under their influence. </p>
                    <p>Now, when Claus began to make children happy he kept them out of the power of
                        the Awgwas; for children possessing such lovely <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0147" n="98"/> playthings as he gave them had no
                        wish to obey the evil thoughts the Awgwas tried to thrust into their minds. </p>
                    <p>Therefore, one year when the wicked tribe was to elect a new King, they chose
                        an Awgwa who proposed to destroy Claus and take him away from the children. </p>
                    <p>"There are, as you know, fewer naughty children in the world since Claus came
                        to the Laughing Valley and began to make his toys,'' said the new King, as
                        he squatted upon a rock and looked around at the scowling faces of his
                        people. "Why, Bessie Blithesome has not stamped her foot once this month,
                        nor has Mayrie's brother slapped his sister's face or thrown the puppy into
                        the rain-barrel. Little Weekum took his bath last night without screaming or
                        struggling, because his mother had promised he should take his toy cat to
                        bed with him! Such a condition of affairs is awful for any Awgwa to think
                        of, and the only way we <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0148" n="99"/> can direct
                        the naughty actions of children is to take this person Claus away from
                        them.'' </p>
                    <p>"Good! good!'' cried the big Awgwas, in a chorus, and they clapped their
                        hands to applaud the speech of the King. </p>
                    <p>"But what shall we do with him?'' asked one of the creatures. </p>
                    <p>"I have a plan,'' replied the wicked King; and what his plan was you will
                        soon discover. </p>
                    <p>That night Claus went to bed feeling very happy, for he had completed no less
                        than four pretty toys during the day, and they were sure, he thought, to
                        make four little children happy. But while he slept the band of invisible
                        Awgwas surrounded his bed, bound him with stout cords, and then flew away
                        with him to the middle of a dark forest in far off Ethop, where they laid
                        him down and left him. </p>
                    <p>When morning came Claus found himself thousands of miles from any human
                        being, a prisoner in the wild jungle of an unknown land. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0149" n="100"/>
                    <p>From the limb of a tree above his head swayed a huge python, one of those
                        reptiles that are able to crush a man's bones in their coils. A few yards
                        away crouched a savage panther, its glaring red eyes fixed full on the
                        helpless Claus. One of those monstrous spotted spiders whose sting is death
                        crept stealthily toward him over the matted leaves, which shriveled and
                        turned black at its very touch. </p>
                    <p>But Claus had been reared in Burzee, and was not afraid. </p>
                    <p>"Come to me, ye Knooks of the Forest!'' he cried, and gave the low, peculiar
                        whistle that the Knooks know. </p>
                    <p>The panther, which was about to spring upon its victim, turned and slunk
                        away. The python swung itself into the tree and disappeared among the
                        leaves. The spider stopped short in its advance and hid beneath a rotting
                        log. </p>
                    <p>Claus had no time to notice them, for he was surrounded by a band of
                        harsh-featured Knooks, <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0150" n="101"/> more
                        crooked and deformed in appearance than any he had ever seen. </p>
                    <p>"Who are you that call on us?'' demanded one, in a gruff voice. </p>
                    <p>"The friend of your brothers in Burzee,'' answered Claus. "I have been
                        brought here by my enemies, the Awgwas, and left to perish miserably. Yet
                        now I implore your help to release me and to send me home again.'' </p>
                    <p>"Have you the sign?'' asked another. </p>
                    <p>"Yes,'' said Claus. </p>
                    <p>They cut his bonds, and with his free arms he made the secret sign of the
                        Knooks. </p>
                    <p>Instantly they assisted him to stand upon his feet, and they brought him food
                        and drink to strengthen him. </p>
                    <p>"Our brothers of Burzee make queer friends,'' grumbled an ancient Knook whose
                        flowing beard was pure white. "But he who knows our secret sign and signal
                        is entitled to our help, whoever he may be. Close your eyes, stranger, <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0151" n="102"/> and we will conduct you to your
                        home. Where shall we seek it?'' </p>
                    <p>" 'Tis in the Laughing Valley,'' answered Claus, shutting his eyes. </p>
                    <p>"There is but one Laughing Valley in the known world, so we can not go
                        astray,'' remarked the Knook. </p>
                    <p>As he spoke the sound of his voice seemed to die away, so Claus opened his
                        eyes to see what caused the change. To his astonishment he found himself
                        seated on the bench by his own door, with the Laughing Valley spread out
                        before him. That day he visited the Wood-Nymphs and related his adventure to
                        Queen Zurline and Necile. </p>
                    <p>"The Awgwas have become your enemies,'' said the lovely Queen, thoughtfully;
                        "so we must do all we can to protect you from their power. </p>
                    <p>"It was cowardly to bind him while he slept,'' remarked Necile, with
                        indignation. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0152" n="103"/>
                    <p>"The evil ones are ever cowardly,'' answered Zurline, "but our friend's
                        slumber shall not be disturbed again.'' </p>
                    <p>The Queen herself came to the dwelling of Claus that evening and placed her
                        Seal on every door and window, to keep out the Awgwas. And under the Seal of
                        Queen Zurline was placed the Seal of the Fairies and the Seal of the Ryls
                        and the Seal of the Knooks, that the charm might become more powerful. </p>
                    <p>And Claus carried his toys to the children again, and made many more of the
                        little ones happy. </p>
                    <p>You may guess how angry the King Awgwa and his fierce band were when it was
                        known to them that Claus had escaped from the Forest of Ethop. </p>
                    <p>They raged madly for a whole week, and then held another meeting among the
                        rocks. </p>
                    <p>"It is useless to carry him where the Knooks reign,'' said the King, "for he
                        has their <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0153" n="104"/> protection. So let us
                        cast him into a cave of our own mountains, where he will surely perish.'' </p>
                    <p>This was promptly agreed to, and the wicked band set out that night to seize
                        Claus. But they found his dwelling guarded by the Seals of the Immortals and
                        were obliged to go away baffled and disappointed. </p>
                    <p>"Never mind,'' said the King; "he does not sleep always!'' </p>
                    <p>Next day, as Claus traveled to the village across the plain, where he
                        intended to present a toy squirrel to a lame boy, he was suddenly set upon
                        by the Awgwas, who seized him and carried him away to the mountains. </p>
                    <p>There they thrust him within a deep cavern and rolled many huge rocks against
                        the entrance to prevent his escape. </p>
                    <p>Deprived thus of light and food, and with little air to breathe, our Claus
                        was, indeed, in a pitiful plight. But he spoke the mystic words of the
                        Fairies, which always command their <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0154" n="105"
                        /> friendly aid, and they came to his rescue and transported him to the
                        Laughing Valley in the twinkling of an eye. </p>
                    <p>Thus the Awgwas discovered they might not destroy one who had earned the
                        friendship of the immortals; so the evil band sought other means of keeping
                        Claus from bringing happiness to children and so making them obedient. </p>
                    <p>Whenever Claus set out to carry his toys to the little ones an Awgwa, who had
                        been set to watch his movements, sprang upon him and snatched the toys from
                        his grasp. And the children were no more disappointed than was Claus when he
                        was obliged to return home disconsolate. Still he persevered, and made many
                        toys for his little friends and started with them for the villages. And
                        always the Awgwas robbed him as soon as he had left the Valley. </p>
                    <p>They threw the stolen playthings into one of their lonely caverns, and quite
                        a heap of toys <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0155" n="106"/> accumulated before
                        Claus became discouraged and gave up all attempts to leave the Valley. Then
                        children began coming to him, since they found he did not go to them; but
                        the wicked Awgwas flew around them and caused their steps to stray and the
                        paths to become crooked, so never a little one could find a way into the
                        Laughing Valley. </p>
                    <p>Lonely days now fell upon Claus, for he was denied the pleasure of bringing
                        happiness to the children whom he had learned to love. Yet he bore up
                        bravely, for he thought surely the time would come when the Awgwas would
                        abandon their evil designs to injure him </p>
                    <p>He devoted all his hours to toy-making, and when one plaything had been
                        completed he stood it on a shelf he had built for that purpose. When the
                        shelf became filled with rows of toys he made another one, and filled that
                        also. So that in time he had many shelves filled with gay and beautiful toys
                        representing horses, <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0156" n="107"/> dogs, cats,
                        elephants, lambs, rabbits and deer, as well as pretty dolls of all sizes and
                        balls and marbles of baked clay painted in gay colors. </p>
                    <p>Often, as he glanced at this array of childish treasures, the heart of good
                        old Claus became sad, so greatly did he long to carry the toys to his
                        children. And at last, because he could bear it no longer, he ventured to go
                        to the great Ak, to whom he told the story of his persecution by the Awgwas,
                        and begged the Master Woodsman to assist him. </p>

                    <head> CHAPTER SEVENTH: The Great Battle Between Good and Evil</head>
                    <p> AK LISTENED gravely to the recital of Claus, stroking his beard the while
                        with the slow, graceful motion that betokened deep thought. He nodded
                        approvingly when Claus told how the Knooks and Fairies had saved him from
                        death, and frowned when he heard how the Awgwas had stolen the children's
                        toys. At last he said: </p>
                    <p>"From the beginning I have approved the work you are doing among the children
                        of men, and it annoys me that your good deeds should be thwarted by the
                        Awgwas. We immortals have no connection whatever with the evil creatures who
                        have attacked you. Always have we <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0158" n="109"/>
                        avoided them, and they, in turn, have hitherto taken care not to cross our
                        pathway. But in this matter I find they have interfered with one of our
                        friends, and I will ask them to abandon their persecutions, as you are under
                        our protection.'' </p>
                    <p>Claus thanked the Master Woodsman most gratefully and returned to his Valley,
                        while Ak, who never delayed carrying out his promises, at once traveled to
                        the mountains of the Awgwas. </p>
                    <p>There, standing on the bare rocks, he called on the King and his people to
                        appear. </p>
                    <p>Instantly the place was filled with throngs of the scowling Awgwas, and their
                        King, perching himself on a point of rock, demanded fiercely: </p>
                    <p>"Who dares call on us?'' </p>
                    <p>"It is I, the Master Woodsman of the World,'' responded Ak. </p>
                    <p>"Here are no forests for you to claim,'' cried the King, angrily. "We owe no
                        allegiance to you, nor to any immortal!'' </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0159" n="110"/>
                    <p>"That is true,'' replied Ak, calmly. "Yet you have ventured to interfere with
                        the actions of Claus, who dwells in the Laughing Valley, and is under our
                        protection.'' </p>
                    <p>Many of the Awgwas began muttering at this speech, and their King turned
                        threateningly on the Master Woodsman. </p>
                    <p>"You are set to rule the forests, but the plains and the valleys are ours!''
                        he shouted. "Keep to your own dark woods! We will do as we please with
                        Claus.'' </p>
                    <p>"You shall not harm our friend in any way!'' replied Ak. </p>
                    <p>"Shall we not?'' asked the King, impudently. "You will see! Our powers are
                        vastly superior to those of mortals, and fully as great as those of
                        immortals.'' </p>
                    <p>"It is your conceit that misleads you!'' said Ak, sternly. "You are a
                        transient race, passing from life into nothingness. We, who live forever,
                        pity but despise you. On earth you are <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0160"
                            n="111"/> scorned by all, and in Heaven you have no place! Even the
                        mortals, after their earth life, enter another existence for all time, and
                        so are your superiors. How then dare you, who are neither mortal nor
                        immortal, refuse to obey my wish?'' </p>
                    <p>The Awgwas sprang to their feet with menacing gestures, but their King
                        motioned them back. </p>
                    <p>"Never before,'' he cried to Ak, while his voice trembled with rage, "has an
                        immortal declared himself the master of the Awgwas! Never shall an immortal
                        venture to interfere with our actions again! For we will avenge your
                        scornful words by killing your friend Claus within three days. Nor you, nor
                        all the immortals can save him from our wrath. We defy your powers! Begone,
                        Master Woodsman of the World! In the country of the Awgwas you have no
                        place.'' </p>
                    <p>"It is war!'' declared Ak, with flashing eyes. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0161" n="112"/>
                    <p>"It is war!'' returned the King, savagely. "In three days your friend will be
                        dead.'' </p>
                    <p>The Master turned away and came to his Forest of Burzee, where he called a
                        meeting of the immortals and told them of the defiance of the Awgwas and
                        their purpose to kill Claus within three days. </p>
                    <p>The little folk listened to him quietly. </p>
                    <p>"What shall we do?'' asked Ak. </p>
                    <p>"These creatures are of no benefit to the world,'' said the Prince of the
                        Knooks; "we must destroy them.'' </p>
                    <p>"Their lives are devoted only to evil deeds,'' said the Prince of the Ryls.
                        "We must destroy them. </p>
                    <p>"They have no conscience, and endeavor to make all mortals as bad as
                        themselves,'' said the Queen of the Fairies. "We must destroy them.'' </p>
                    <p>"They have defied the great Ak, and threaten the life of our adopted son,''
                        said beautiful Queen Zurline. "We must destroy them.'' </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0162" n="113"/>
                    <p>The Master Woodsman smiled. </p>
                    <p>"You speak well,'' said he. "These Awgwas we know to be a powerful race, and
                        they will fight desperately; yet the outcome is certain. For we who live can
                        never die, even though conquered by our enemies, while every Awgwa who is
                        struck down is one foe the less to oppose us. Prepare, then, for battle, and
                        let us resolve to show no mercy to the wicked!'' </p>
                    <p>Thus arose that terrible war between the immortals and the spirits of evil
                        which is sung of in Fairyland to this very day. </p>
                    <p>The King Awgwa and his band determined to carry out the threat to destroy
                        Claus. They now hated him for two reasons: he made children happy and was a
                        friend of the Master Woodsman. But since Ak's visit they had reason to fear
                        the opposition of the immortals, and they dreaded defeat. So the King sent
                        swift messengers to all parts of the world to summon every evil creature to
                        his aid. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0163" n="114"/>
                    <p>And on the third day after the declaration of war a mighty army was at the
                        command of the King Awgwa. There were three hundred Asiatic Dragons,
                        breathing fire that consumed everything it touched. These hated mankind and
                        all good spirits. And there were the three-eyed Giants of Tatary, a host in
                        themselves, who liked nothing better than to fight. And next came the Black
                        Demons from Patalonia, with great spreading wings like those of a bat, which
                        swept terror and misery through the world as they beat upon the air. And
                        joined to these were the Goozzle-Goblins, with long talons as sharp as
                        swords, with which they clawed the flesh from their foes. Finally, every
                        mountain Awgwa in the world had come to participate in the great battle with
                        the immortals. </p>
                    <p>The King Awgwa looked around upon this vast army and his heart beat high with
                        wicked pride, for he believed he would surely triumph over his gentle
                        enemies, who had never before <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0164" n="115"/>
                        been known to fight. But the Master Woodsman had not been idle. None of his
                        people was used to warfare, yet now that they were called upon to face the
                        hosts of evil they willingly prepared for the fray. </p>
                    <p>Ak had commanded them to assemble in the Laughing Valley, where Claus,
                        ignorant of the terrible battle that was to be waged on his account, was
                        quietly making his toys. </p>
                    <p>Soon the entire Valley, from hill to hill, was filled with the little
                        immortals. The Master Woodsman stood first, bearing a gleaming ax that shone
                        like burnished silver. Next came the Ryls, armed with sharp thorns from
                        bramblebushes. Then the Knooks, bearing the spears they used when they were
                        forced to prod their savage beasts into submission. The Fairies, dressed in
                        white gauze with rainbow-hued wings, bore golden wands, and the Wood-nymphs,
                        in their uniforms of oak-leaf green, carried switches from ash trees as
                        weapons. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0165" n="116"/>
                    <p>Loud laughed the Awgwa King when he beheld the size and the arms of his foes.
                        To be sure the mighty ax of the Woodsman was to be dreaded, but the
                        sweet-faced Nymphs and pretty Fairies, the gentle Ryls and crooked Knooks
                        were such harmless folk that he almost felt shame at having called such a
                        terrible host to oppose them. </p>
                    <p>"Since these fools dare fight,'' he said to the leader of the Tatary Giants,
                        "I will overwhelm them with our evil powers!'' </p>
                    <p>To begin the battle he poised a great stone in his left hand and cast it full
                        against the sturdy form of the Master Woodsman, who turned it aside with his
                        ax. Then rushed the three-eyed Giants of Tatary upon the Knooks, and the
                        Goozzle-Goblins upon the Ryls, and the firebreathing Dragons upon the sweet
                        Fairies. Because the Nymphs were Ak's own people the band of Awgwas sought
                        them out, thinking to overcome them with ease. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0166" n="Illustration"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0167"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0168" n="117"/>

                    <p>But it is the Law that while Evil, unopposed, may accomplish terrible deeds,
                        the powers of Good can never be overthrown when opposed to Evil. Well had it
                        been for the King Awgwa had he known the Law! </p>
                    <p>His ignorance cost him his existence, for one flash of the ax borne by the
                        Master Woodsman of the World cleft the wicked King in twain and rid the
                        earth of the vilest creature it contained. </p>
                    <p>Greatly marveled the Tatary Giants when the spears of the little Knooks
                        pierced their thick walls of flesh and sent them reeling to the ground with
                        howls of agony. </p>
                    <p>Woe came upon the sharp-taloned Goblins when the thorns of the Ryls reached
                        their savage hearts and let their life-blood sprinkle all the plain. And
                        afterward from every drop a thistle grew. </p>
                    <p>The Dragons paused astonished before the Fairy wands, from whence rushed a
                        power that <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0169" n="118"/> caused their fiery
                        breaths to flow back on themselves so that they shriveled away and died. </p>
                    <p>As for the Awgwas, they had scant time to realize how they were destroyed,
                        for the ash switches of the Nymphs bore a charm unknown to any Awgwa, and
                        turned their foes into clods of earth at the slightest touch! </p>
                    <p>When Ak leaned upon his gleaming ax and turned to look over the field of
                        battle he saw the few Giants who were able to run disappearing over the
                        distant hills on their return to Tatary. The Goblins had perished every one,
                        as had the terrible Dragons, while all that remained of the wicked Awgwas
                        was a great number of earthen hillocks dotting the plain. </p>
                    <p>And now the immortals melted from the Valley like dew at sunrise, to resume
                        their duties in the Forest, while Ak walked slowly and thoughtfully to the
                        house of Claus and entered. </p>
                    <p>"You have many toys ready for the children,'' said the Woodsman, "and now you
                        may carry <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0170" n="119"/> them across the plain
                        to the dwellings and the villages without fear.'' </p>
                    <p>"Will not the Awgwas harm me?'' asked Claus, eagerly. </p>
                    <p>"The Awgwas,'' said Ak, "have perished!'' </p>
                    <p>Now I will gladly have done with wicked spirits and with fighting and
                        bloodshed. It was not from choice that I told of the Awgwas and their
                        allies, and of their great battle with the immortals. They were part of this
                        history, and could not be avoided. </p>
                </div2>

                <div2 id="d23" n="8" type="chapter">
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0171" n="120"/>
                    <head> CHAPTER EIGHTH: The First Journey with the Reindeer</head>
                    <p> THOSE were happy days for Claus when he carried his accumulation of toys to
                        the children who had awaited them so long. During his imprisonment in the
                        Valley he had been so industrious that all his shelves were filled with
                        playthings, and after quickly supplying the little ones living near by he
                        saw he must now extend his travels to wider fields. </p>
                    <p>Remembering the time when he had journeyed with Ak through all the world, he
                        knew children were everywhere, and he longed to make as many as possible
                        happy with his gifts. </p>
                    <p>So he loaded a great sack with all kinds of toys, slung it upon his back that
                        he might carry <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0172" n="121"/> it more easily,
                        and started off on a longer trip than he had yet undertaken. </p>
                    <p>Wherever he showed his merry face, in hamlet or in farmhouse, he received a
                        cordial welcome, for his fame had spread into far lands. At each village the
                        children swarmed about him, following his footsteps wherever he went; and
                        the women thanked him gratefully for the joy he brought their little ones;
                        and the men looked upon him curiously that he should devote his time to such
                        a queer occupation as toy-making. But every one smiled on him and gave him
                        kindly words, and Claus felt amply repaid for his long journey. </p>
                    <p>When the sack was empty he went back again to the Laughing Valley and once
                        more filled it to the brim. This time he followed another road, into a
                        different part of the country, and carried happiness to many children who
                        never before had owned a toy or guessed that such a delightful plaything
                        existed. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0173" n="122"/>
                    <p>After a third journey, so far away that Claus was many days walking the
                        distance, the store of toys became exhausted and without delay he set about
                        making a fresh supply. </p>
                    <p>From seeing so many children and studying their tastes he had acquired
                        several new ideas about toys. </p>
                    <p>The dollies were, he had found, the most delightful of all playthings for
                        babies and little girls, and often those who could not say "dolly'' would
                        call for a "doll'' in their sweet baby talk. So Claus resolved to make many
                        dolls, of all sizes, and to dress them in bright-colored clothing. The older
                        boys&mdash;and even some of the girls&mdash;loved the images of
                        animals, so he still made cats and elephants and horses. And many of the
                        little fellows had musical natures, and longed for drums and cymbals and
                        whistles and horns. So he made a number of toy drums, with tiny sticks to
                        beat them with; and he made whistles from <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0174"
                            n="123"/> the willow trees, and horns from the bog-reeds, and cymbals
                        from bits of beaten metal. </p>
                    <p>All this kept him busily at work, and before he realized it the winter season
                        came, with deeper snows than usual, and he knew he could not leave the
                        Valley with his heavy pack. Moreover, the next trip would take him farther
                        from home than ever before, and Jack Frost was mischievous enough to nip his
                        nose and ears if he undertook the long journey while the Frost King reigned.
                        The Frost King was Jack's father and never reproved him for his pranks. </p>
                    <p>So Claus remained at his work-bench; but he whistled and sang as merrily as
                        ever, for he would allow no disappointment to sour his temper or make him
                        unhappy. </p>
                    <p>One bright morning he looked from his window and saw two of the deer he had
                        known in the Forest walking toward his house. </p>
                    <p>Claus was surprised; not that the friendly deer should visit him, but that
                        they walked on <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0175" n="124"/> the surface of the
                        snow as easily as if it were solid ground, notwithstanding the fact that
                        throughout the Valley the snow lay many feet deep. He had walked out of his
                        house a day or two before and had sunk to his armpits in a drift. </p>
                    <p>So when the deer came near he opened the door and called to them: </p>
                    <p>"Good morning, Flossie! Tell me how you are able to walk on the snow so
                        easily.'' </p>
                    <p>"It is frozen hard,'' answered Flossie. </p>
                    <p>"The Frost King has breathed on it,'' said Glossie, coming up, "and the
                        surface is now as solid as ice.'' </p>
                    <p>"Perhaps,'' remarked Claus, thoughtfully, "I might now carry my pack of toys
                        to the children.'' </p>
                    <p>"Is it a long journey?'' asked Flossie. </p>
                    <p>"Yes; it will take me many days, for the pack is heavy,'' answered Claus. </p>
                    <p>"Then the snow would melt before you <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0176" n="125"
                        /> could get back,'' said the deer. "You must wait until spring, Claus.'' </p>
                    <p>Claus sighed. "Had I your fleet feet,'' said he, "I could make the journey in
                        a day.'' </p>
                    <p>"But you have not,'' returned Glossie, looking at his own slender legs with
                        pride. </p>
                    <p>"Perhaps I could ride upon your back,'' Claus ventured to remark, after a
                        pause. </p>
                    <p>"Oh, no; our backs are not strong enough to bear your weight,'' said Flossie,
                        decidedly. "But if you had a sledge, and could harness us to it, we might
                        draw you easily, and your pack as well.'' </p>
                    <p>"I'll make a sledge!'' exclaimed Claus. "Will you agree to draw me if I do?'' </p>
                    <p>"Well,'' replied Flossie, "we must first go and ask the Knooks, who are our
                        guardians, for permission; but if they consent, and you can make a sledge
                        and harness, we will gladly assist you. </p>
                    <p>"Then go at once!'' cried Claus, eagerly. <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0177"
                            n="126"/> "I am sure the friendly Knooks will give their consent, and by
                        the time you are back I shall be ready to harness you to my sledge.'' </p>
                    <p>Flossie and Glossie, being deer of much in-telligence, had long wished to see
                        the great world, so they gladly ran over the frozen snow to ask the Knooks
                        if they might carry Claus on his journey. </p>
                    <p>Meantime the toy-maker hurriedly began the construction of a sledge, using
                        material from his wood-pile. He made two long runners that turned upward at
                        the front ends, and across these nailed short boards, to make a platform. It
                        was soon completed, but was as rude in appearance as it is possible for a
                        sledge to be. </p>
                    <p>The harness was more difficult to prepare, but Claus twisted strong cords
                        together and knotted them so they would fit around the necks of the deer, in
                        the shape of a collar. From these ran other cords to fasten the deer to the
                        front of the sledge. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0178" n="127"/>
                    <p>Before the work was completed Glossie and Flossie were back from the Forest,
                        having been granted permission by Will Knook to make the journey with Claus
                        provided they would return to Burzee by daybreak the next morning. </p>
                    <p>"That is not a very long time,'' said Flossie; "but we are swift and strong,
                        and if we get started by this evening we can travel many miles during the
                        night.'' </p>
                    <p>Claus decided to make the attempt, so he hurried on his preparations as fast
                        as possible. After a time he fastened the collars around the necks of his
                        steeds and harnessed them to his rude sledge. Then he placed a stool on the
                        little platform, to serve as a seat, and filled a sack with his prettiest
                        toys. </p>
                    <p>"How do you intend to guide us?'' asked Glossie. "We have never been out of
                        the For-est before, excet{sic} to visit your house, so we shall not know the
                        way.'' </p>
                    <p>Claus thought about that for a moment. <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0179"
                            n="123"/> Then he brought more cords and fastened two of them to the
                        spreading antlers of each deer, one on the right and the other on the left. </p>
                    <p>"Those will be my reins,'' said Claus, "and when I pull them to the right or
                        to the left you must go in that direction. If I do not pull the reins at all
                        you may go straight ahead.'' </p>
                    <p>"Very well,'' answered Glossie and Flossie; and then they asked: "Are you
                        ready?'' </p>
                    <p>Claus seated himself upon the stool, placed the sack of toys at his feet, and
                        then gathered up the reins. </p>
                    <p>"All ready!'' he shouted; "away we go!'' </p>
                    <p>The deer leaned forward, lifted their slender limbs, and the next moment away
                        flew the sledge over the frozen snow. The swiftness of the motion surprised
                        Claus, for in a few strides they were across the Valley and gliding over the
                        broad plain beyond. </p>

                    <p>The day had melted into evening by the time they started; for, swiftly as
                        Claus had worked, <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0180" n="Illustration"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0181"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0182" n="124"/> many hours had been consumed in
                        making his preparations. But the moon shone brightly to light their way, and
                        Claus soon decided it was just as pleasant to travel by night as by day. </p>
                    <p>The deer liked it better; for, although they wished to see something of the
                        world, they were timid about meeting men, and now all the dwellers in the
                        towns and farmhouses were sound asleep and could not see them. </p>
                    <p>Away and away they sped, on and on over the hills and through the valleys and
                        across the plains until they reached a village where Claus had never been
                        before. </p>
                    <p>Here he called on them to stop, and they immediately obeyed. But a new
                        difficulty now presented itself, for the people had locked their doors when
                        they went to bed, and Claus found he could not enter the houses to leave his
                        toys. </p>
                    <p>"I am afraid, my friends, we have made our journey for nothing,'' said he,
                        "for I shall be obliged to carry my playthings back home again <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0183" n="130"/> without giving them to the
                        children of this village.'' </p>
                    <p>"What's the matter?'' asked Flossie. </p>
                    <p>"The doors are locked,'' answered Claus, "and I can not get in.'' </p>
                    <p>Glossie looked around at the houses. The snow was quite deep in that village,
                        and just before them was a roof only a few feet above the sledge. A broad
                        chimney, which seemed to Glossie big enough to admit Claus, was at the peak
                        of the roof. </p>
                    <p>"Why don't you climb down that chimney?'' asked Glossie. </p>
                    <p>Claus looked at it. </p>
                    <p>"That would be easy enough if I were on top of the roof,'' he answered. </p>
                    <p>"Then hold fast and we will take you there,'' said the deer, and they gave
                        one bound to the roof and landed beside the big chimney. </p>
                    <p>"Good!'' cried Claus, well pleased, and he <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0184"
                            n="131"/> slung the pack of toys over his shoulder and got into the
                        chimney. </p>
                    <p>There was plenty of soot on the bricks, but he did not mind that, and by
                        placing his hands and knees against the sides he crept down-ward until he
                        had reached the fireplace. Leaping lightly over the smoldering coals he
                        found himself in a large sitting-room, where a dim light was burning. </p>
                    <p>From this room two doorways led into smaller chambers. In one a woman lay
                        asleep, with a baby beside her in a crib. </p>
                    <p>Claus laughed, but he did not laugh aloud for fear of waking the baby. Then
                        he slipped a big doll from his pack and laid it in the crib. The little one
                        smiled, as if it dreamed of the pretty plaything it was to find on the
                        morrow, and Claus crept softly from the room and entered at the other
                        doorway. </p>
                    <p>Here were two boys, fast asleep with their arms around each other's neck.
                        Claus gazed at <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0185" n="132"/> them lovingly a
                        moment and then placed upon the bed a drum, two horns and a wooden elephant. </p>
                    <p>He did not linger, now that his work in this house was done, but climbed the
                        chimney again and seated himself on his sledge. </p>
                    <p>"Can you find another chimney?'' he asked the reindeer. </p>
                    <p>"Easily enough,'' replied Glossie and Flossie. </p>
                    <p>Down to the edge of the roof they raced, and then, without pausing, leaped
                        through the air to the top of the next building, where a huge, old-fashioned
                        chimney stood. </p>
                    <p>"Don't be so long, this time,'' called Flossie, "or we shall never get back
                        to the Forest by daybreak.'' </p>

                    <p>Claus made a trip down this chimney also and found five children sleeping in
                        the house, all of whom were quickly supplied with toys. </p>
                    <p>When he returned the deer sprang to the next roof, but on descending the
                        chimney Claus <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0186" n="133"/> found no children
                        there at all. That was not often the case in this village, however, so he
                        lost less time than you might suppose in visiting the dreary homes where
                        there were no little ones. </p>
                    <p>When he had climbed down the chimneys of all the houses in that village, and
                        had left a toy for every sleeping child, Claus found that his great sack was
                        not yet half emptied. </p>
                    <p>"Onward, friends!'' he called to the deer; "we must seek another village.'' </p>
                    <p>So away they dashed, although it was long past midnight, and in a
                        surprisingly short time they came to a large city, the largest Claus had
                        ever visited since he began to make toys. But, nothing daunted by the throng
                        of houses, he set to work at once and his beautiful steeds carried him
                        rapidly from one roof to another, only the highest being beyond the leaps of
                        the agile deer. </p>
                    <p>At last the supply of toys was exhausted and Claus seated himself in the
                        sledge, with the <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0187" n="134"/> empty sack at
                        his feet, and turned the heads of Glossie and Flossie toward home. </p>
                    <p>Presently Flossie asked: </p>
                    <p>"What is that gray streak in the sky?'' </p>
                    <p>"It is the coming dawn of day,'' answered Claus, surprised to find that it
                        was so late. </p>
                    <p>"Good gracious!'' exclaimed Glossie; "then we shall not be home by daybreak,
                        and the Knooks will punish us and never let us come again.'' </p>
                    <p>"We must race for the Laughing Valley and make our best speed,'' returned
                        Flossie; "so hold fast, friend Claus!'' </p>
                    <p>Claus held fast and the next moment was flying so swiftly over the snow that
                        he could not see the trees as they whirled past. Up hill and down dale,
                        swift as an arrow shot from a bow they dashed, and Claus shut his eyes to
                        keep the wind out of them and left the deer to find their own way. </p>
                    <p>It seemed to him they were plunging through <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0188"
                            n="135"/> space, but he was not at all afraid. The Knooks were severe
                        masters, and must be obeyed at all hazards, and the gray streak in the sky
                        was growing brighter every moment. </p>
                    <p>Finally the sledge came to a sudden stop and Claus, who was taken unawares,
                        tumbled from his seat into a snowdrift. As he picked himself up he heard the
                        deer crying: </p>
                    <p>"Quick, friend, quick! Cut away our harness!'' </p>
                    <p>He drew his knife and rapidly severed the cords, and then he wiped the
                        moisture from his eyes and looked around him. </p>
                    <p>The sledge had come to a stop in the Laughing Valley, only a few feet, he
                        found, from his own door. In the East the day was breaking, and turning to
                        the edge of Burzee he saw Glossie and Flossie just disappearing in the
                        Forest. </p>

                    <head> CHAPTER NINTH: "Santa Claus!''</head>
                    <p> CLAUS thought that none of the children would ever know where the toys came
                        from which they found by their bedsides when they wakened the following
                        morning. But kindly deeds are sure to bring fame, and fame has many wings to
                        carry its tidings into far lands; so for miles and miles in every direction
                        people were talking of Claus and his wonderful gifts to children. The sweet
                        generousness of his work caused a few selfish folk to sneer, but even these
                        were forced to admit their respect for a man so gentle-natured that he loved
                        to devote his life to pleasing the helpless little ones of his race. </p>
                    <p>Therefore the inhabitants of every city and village had been eagerly watching
                        the coming of <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0190" n="137"/> Claus, and
                        remarkable stories of his beautiful playthings were told the children to
                        keep them patient and contented. </p>
                    <p>When, on the morning following the first trip of Claus with his deer, the
                        little ones came running to their parents with the pretty toys they had
                        found, and asked from whence they came, there was but one reply to the
                        question. </p>
                    <p>"The good Claus must have been here, my darlings; for his are the only toys
                        in all the world!'' </p>
                    <p>"But how did he get in?'' asked the children. </p>
                    <p>At this the fathers shook their heads, being themselves unable to understand
                        how Claus had gained admittance to their homes; but the mothers, watching
                        the glad faces of their dear ones, whispered that the good Claus was no
                        mortal man but assuredly a Saint, and they piously blessed his name for the
                        happiness he had bestowed upon their children. </p>
                    <p>"A Saint,'' said one, with bowed head, "has <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0191"
                            n="138"/> no need to unlock doors if it pleases him to enter our
                        homes.'' </p>
                    <p>And, afterward, when a child was naughty or disobedient, its mother would
                        say: </p>
                    <p>"You must pray to the good Santa Claus for forgiveness. He does not like
                        naughty children, and, unless you repent, he will bring you no more pretty
                        toys.'' </p>
                    <p>But Santa Claus himself would not have approved this speech. He brought toys
                        to the children because they were little and helpless, and because he loved
                        them. He knew that the best of children were sometimes naughty, and that the
                        naughty ones were often good. It is the way with children, the world over,
                        and he would not have changed their natures had he possessed the power to do
                        so. </p>
                    <p>And that is how our Claus became Santa Claus. It is possible for any man, by
                        good deeds, to enshrine himself as a Saint in the hearts of the people. </p>

                    <head> CHAPTER TENTH: Christmas Eve</head>
                    <p> THE day that broke as Claus returned from his night ride with Glossie and
                        Flossie brought to him a new trouble. Will Knook, the chief guardian of the
                        deer, came to him, surly and ill-tempered, to complain that he had kept
                        Glossie and Flossie beyond daybreak, in opposition to his orders. </p>
                    <p>"Yet it could not have been very long after daybreak, said Claus. </p>
                    <p>"It was one minute after,'' answered Will Knook, "and that is as bad as one
                        hour. I shall set the stinging gnats on Glossie and Flossie, and they will
                        thus suffer terribly for their disobedience.'' </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0193" n="140"/>
                    <p>"Don't do that!'' begged Claus. "It was my fault.'' </p>
                    <p>But Will Knook would listen to no excuses, and went away grumbling and
                        growling in his ill-natured way. </p>
                    <p>For this reason Claus entered the Forest to consult Necile about rescuing the
                        good deer from punishment. To his delight he found his old friend, the
                        Master Woodsman, seated in the circle of Nymphs. </p>
                    <p>Ak listened to the story of the night journey to the children and of the
                        great assistance the deer had been to Claus by drawing his sledge over the
                        frozen snow. </p>
                    <p>"I do not wish my friends to be punished if I can save them,'' said the
                        toy-maker, when he had finished the relation. "They were only one minute
                        late, and they ran swifter than a bird flies to get home before daybreak.'' </p>
                    <p>Ak stroked his beard thoughtfully a moment, and then sent for the Prince of
                        the Knooks, <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0194" n="Illustration"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0195"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0196" n="141"/> who rules all his people in
                        Burzee, and also for the Queen of the Fairies and the Prince of the Ryls. </p>
                    <p>When all had assembled Claus told his story again, at Ak's command, and then
                        the Master addressed the Prince of the Knooks, saying: </p>
                    <p>"The good work that Claus is doing among mankind deserves the support of
                        every honest immortal. Already he is called a Saint in some of the towns,
                        and before long the name of Santa Claus will be lovingly known in every home
                        that is blessed with children. Moreover, he is a son of our Forest, so we
                        owe him our encouragement. You, Ruler of the Knooks, have known him these
                        many years; am I not right in saying he deserves our friendship?'' </p>
                    <p>The Prince, crooked and sour of visage as all Knooks are, looked only upon
                        the dead leaves at his feet and muttered: "You are the Master Woodsman of
                        the World!'' </p>
                    <p>Ak smiled, but continued, in soft tones: "It <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0197"
                            n="142"/> seems that the deer which are guarded by your people can be of
                        great assistance to Claus, and as they seem willing to draw his sledge I beg
                        that you will permit him to use their services whenever he pleases.'' </p>
                    <p>The Prince did not reply, but tapped the curled point of his sandal with the
                        tip of his spear, as if in thought. </p>
                    <p>Then the Fairy Queen spoke to him in this way: "If you consent to Ak's
                        request I will see that no harm comes to your deer while they are away from
                        the Forest.'' </p>
                    <p>And the Prince of the Ryls added: "For my part I will allow to every deer
                        that assists Claus the privilege of eating my casa plants, which give
                        strength, and my grawle plants, which give fleetness of foot, and my marbon
                        plants, which give long life.'' </p>
                    <p>And the Queen of the Nymphs said: "The deer which draw the sledge of Claus
                        will be permitted to bathe in the Forest pool of Nares, <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0198" n="143"/> which will give them sleek coats
                        and wonderful beauty.'' </p>
                    <p>The Prince of the Knooks, hearing these promises, shifted uneasily on his
                        seat, for in his heart he hated to refuse a request of his fellow immortals,
                        although they were asking an unusual favor at his hands, and the Knooks are
                        unaccustomed to granting favors of any kind. Finally he turned to his
                        servants and said: </p>
                    <p>"Call Will Knook.'' </p>
                    <p>When surly Will came and heard the demands of the immortals he protested
                        loudly against granting them. </p>
                    <p>"Deer are deer,'' said he, "and nothing but deer. Were they horses it would
                        be right to harness them like horses. But no one harnesses deer because they
                        are free, wild creatures, owing no service of any sort to mankind. It would
                        degrade my deer to labor for Claus, who is only a man in spite of the
                        friendship lavished on him by the immortals.'' </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0199" n="144"/>
                    <p>"You have heard,'' said the Prince to Ak. "There is truth in what Will
                        says.'' </p>
                    <p>"Call Glossie and Flossie,'' returned the Master. </p>
                    <p>The deer were brought to the conference and Ak asked them if they objected to
                        drawing the sledge for Claus. </p>
                    <p>"No, indeed!'' replied Glossie; "we enjoyed the trip very much.'' </p>
                    <p>"And we tried hard to get home by daybreak,'' added Flossie, "but were
                        unfortunately a minute too late.'' </p>
                    <p>"A minute lost at daybreak doesn't matter,'' said Ak. "You are forgiven for
                        that delay.'' </p>
                    <p>"Provided it does not happen again,'' said the Prince of the Knooks, sternly. </p>
                    <p>"And will you permit them to make another journey with me?'' asked Claus,
                        eagerly. </p>
                    <p>The Prince reflected while he gazed at Will, who was scowling, and at the
                        Master Woodsman, who was smiling. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0200" n="145"/>
                    <p>Then he stood up and addressed the company as follows: </p>
                    <p>"Since you all urge me to grant the favor I will permit the deer to go with
                        Claus once every year, on Christmas Eve, provided they always return to the
                        Forest by daybreak. He may select any number he pleases, up to ten, to draw
                        his sledge, and those shall be known among us as Reindeer, to distinguish
                        them from the others. And they shall bathe in the Pool of Nares, and eat the
                        casa and grawle and marbon plants and shall be under the especial protection
                        of the Fairy Queen. And now cease scowling, Will Knook, for my words shall
                        be obeyed!'' </p>
                    <p>He hobbled quickly away through the trees, to avoid the thanks of Claus and
                        the approval of the other immortals, and Will, looking as cross as ever,
                        followed him. </p>
                    <p>But Ak was satisfied, knowing that he could rely on the promise of the
                        Prince, however grudgingly given; and Glossie and Flossie ran <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0201" n="146"/> home, kicking up their heels
                        delightedly at every step. </p>
                    <p>"When is Christmas Eve?'' Claus asked the Master. </p>
                    <p>"In about ten days,'' he replied. </p>
                    <p>"Then I can not use the deer this year,'' said Claus, thoughtfully, "for I
                        shall not have time enough to make my sackful of toys.'' </p>
                    <p>"The shrewd Prince foresaw that,'' responded Ak, "and therefore named
                        Christmas Eve as the day you might use the deer, knowing it would cause you
                        to lose an entire year.'' </p>
                    <p>"If I only had the toys the Awgwas stole from me,'' said Claus, sadly, "I
                        could easily fill my sack for the children.'' </p>
                    <p>"Where are they?'' asked the Master. </p>
                    <p>"I do not know,'' replied Claus, "but the wicked Awgwas probably hid them in
                        the mountains.'' </p>
                    <p>Ak turned to the Fairy Queen. </p>
                    <p>"Can you find them?'' he asked. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0202" n="147"/>
                    <p>"I will try,'' she replied, brightly. </p>
                    <p>Then Claus went back to the Laughing Valley, to work as hard as he could, and
                        a band of Fairies immediately flew to the mountain that had been haunted by
                        the Awgwas and began a search for the stolen toys. </p>
                    <p>The Fairies, as we well know, possess wonderful powers; but the cunning
                        Awgwas had hidden the toys in a deep cave and covered the opening with
                        rocks, so no one could look in. Therefore all search for the missing
                        playthings proved in vain for several days, and Claus, who sat at home
                        waiting for news from the Fairies, almost despaired of getting the toys
                        before Christmas Eve. </p>
                    <p>He worked hard every moment, but it took considerable time to carve out and
                        to shape each toy and to paint it properly, so that on the morning before
                        Christmas Eve only half of one small shelf above the window was filled with
                        playthings ready for the children. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0203" n="148"/>
                    <p>But on this morning the Fairies who were searching in the mountains had a new
                        thought. They joined hands and moved in a straight line through the rocks
                        that formed the mountain, beginning at the topmost peak and working
                        downward, so that no spot could be missed by their bright eyes. And at last
                        they discovered the cave where the toys had been heaped up by the wicked
                        Awgwas. </p>
                    <p>It did not take them long to burst open the mouth of the cave, and then each
                        one seized as many toys as he could carry and they all flew to Claus and
                        laid the treasure before him. </p>
                    <p>The good man was rejoiced to receive, just in the nick of time, such a store
                        of playthings with which to load his sledge, and he sent word to Glossie and
                        Flossie to be ready for the journey at nightfall. </p>
                    <p>With all his other labors he had managed to find time, since the last trip,
                        to repair the harness and to strengthen his sledge, so that when <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0204" n="149"/> the deer came to him at twilight
                        he had no difficulty in harnessing them. </p>
                    <p>"We must go in another direction to-night,'' he told them, "where we shall
                        find children I have never yet visited. And we must travel fast and work
                        quickly, for my sack is full of toys and running over the brim!'' </p>
                    <p>So, just as the moon arose, they dashed out of the Laughing Valley and across
                        the plain and over the hills to the south. The air was sharp and frosty and
                        the starlight touched the snowflakes and made them glitter like countless
                        diamonds. The reindeer leaped onward with strong, steady bounds, and Claus'
                        heart was so light and merry that he laughed and sang while the wind
                        whistled past his ears:</p>
                    <lg type="verse">
                        <l>"With a ho, ho, ho!</l>
                        <l>And a ha, ha, ha!</l>
                        <l>And a ho, ho! ha, ha, hee</l>

                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0205" n="150"/>

                        <l>Now away we go</l>
                        <l>O'er the frozen snow,</l>
                        <l>As merry as we can be!''</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>Jack Frost heard him and came racing up with his nippers, but when he saw it
                        was Claus he laughed and turned away again. </p>
                    <p>The mother owls heard him as he passed near a wood and stuck their heads out
                        of the hollow places in the tree-trunks; but when they saw who it was they
                        whispered to the owlets nestling near them that it was only Santa Claus
                        carrying toys to the children. It is strange how much those mother owls
                        know. </p>
                    <p>Claus stopped at some of the scattered farm-houses and climbed down the
                        chimneys to leave presents for the babies. Soon after he reached a village
                        and worked merrily for an hour distributing playthings among the sleeping
                        little ones. Then away again he went, singing his joyous carol:</p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0206" n="151"/>

                    <lg type="verse">
                        <l>"Now away we go</l>
                        <l>O'er the gleaming snow,</l>
                        <l>While the deer run swift and free!</l>
                        <l>For to girls and boys</l>
                        <l>We carry the toys</l>
                        <l>That will fill their hearts with glee!''</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>The deer liked the sound of his deep bass voice and kept time to the song
                        with their hoofbeats on the hard snow; but soon they stopped at another
                        chimney and Santa Claus, with sparkling eyes and face brushed red by the
                        wind, climbed down its smoky sides and left a present for every child the
                        house contained. </p>
                    <p>It was a merry, happy night. Swiftly the deer ran, and busily their driver
                        worked to scatter his gifts among the sleeping children. </p>
                    <p>But the sack was empty at last, and the sledge headed homeward; and now again
                        the race with daybreak began. Glossie and Flossie had no mind to be rebuked
                        a second time for tardiness, <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0207" n="152"/> so
                        they fled with a swiftness that enabled them to pass the gale on which the
                        Frost King rode, and soon brought them to the Laughing Valley. </p>
                    <p>It is true that when Claus released his steeds from their harness the eastern
                        sky was streaked with gray, but Glossie and Flossie were deep in the Forest
                        before day fairly broke. </p>
                    <p>Claus was so wearied with his night's work that he threw himself upon his bed
                        and fell into a deep slumber, and while he slept the Christmas sun appeared
                        in the sky and shone upon hundreds of happy homes where the sound of
                        childish laughter proclaimed that Santa Claus had made them a visit. </p>
                    <p>God bless him! It was his first Christmas Eve, and for hundreds of years
                        since then he has nobly fulfilled his mission to bring happiness to the
                        hearts of little children. </p>

                    <head> CHAPTER ELEVENTH: How the First Stockings Were Hung by the Chimneys</head>
                    <p> WHEN you remember that no child, until Santa Claus began his travels, had
                        ever known the pleasure of possessing a toy, you will understand how joy
                        crept into the homes of those who had been favored with a visit from the
                        good man, and how they talked of him day by day in loving tones and were
                        honestly grateful for his kindly deeds. It is true that great warriors and
                        mighty kings and clever scholars of that day were often spoken of by the
                        people; but no one of them was so greatly beloved as Santa Claus, because
                        none other was so unselfish as to devote himself to making others happy. For
                        a generous deed lives longer <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0209" n="154"/> than
                        a great battle or a king's decree or a scholar's essay, because it spreads
                        and leaves its mark on all nature and endures through many generations. </p>
                    <p>The bargain made with the Knook Prince changed the plans of Claus for all
                        future time; for, being able to use the reindeer on but one night of each
                        year, he decided to devote all the other days to the manufacture of
                        playthings, and on Christmas Eve to carry them to the children of the world. </p>
                    <p>But a year's work would, he knew, result in a vast accumulation of toys, so
                        he resolved to build a new sledge that would be larger and stronger and
                        better-fitted for swift travel than the old and clumsy one. </p>
                    <p>His first act was to visit the Gnome King, with whom he made a bargain to
                        exchange three drums, a trumpet and two dolls for a pair of fine steel
                        runners, curled beautifully at the ends. For the Gnome King had children of
                        his <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0210" n="155"/> own, who, living in the
                        hollows under the earth, in mines and caverns, needed something to amuse
                        them. </p>
                    <p>In three days the steel runners were ready, and when Claus brought the
                        playthings to the Gnome King, his Majesty was so greatly pleased with them
                        that he presented Claus with a string of sweet-toned sleigh-bells, in
                        addition to the runners. </p>
                    <p>"These will please Glossie and Flossie,'' said Claus, as he jingled the bells
                        and listened to their merry sound. "But I should have two strings of bells,
                        one for each deer.'' </p>
                    <p>"Bring me another trumpet and a toy cat,'' replied the King, "and you shall
                        have a second string of bells like the first.'' </p>
                    <p>"It is a bargain!'' cried Claus, and he went home again for the toys. </p>
                    <p>The new sledge was carefully built, the Knooks bringing plenty of strong but
                        thin boards to use in its construction. Claus made <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0211" n="156"/> a high, rounding dash-board to
                        keep off the snow cast behind by the fleet hoofs of the deer; and he made
                        high sides to the platform so that many toys could be carried, and finally
                        he mounted the sledge upon the slender steel runners made by the Gnome King. </p>
                    <p>It was certainly a handsome sledge, and big and roomy. Claus painted it in
                        bright colors, although no one was likely to see it during his midnight
                        journeys, and when all was finished he sent for Glossie and Flossie to come
                        and look at it. </p>
                    <p>The deer admired the sledge, but gravely declared it was too big and heavy
                        for them to draw. </p>
                    <p>"We might pull it over the snow, to be sure,'' said Glossie; "but we could
                        not pull it fast enough to enable us to visit the far-away cities and
                        villages and return to the Forest by daybreak.'' </p>
                    <p>"Then I must add two more deer to my <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0212" n="157"
                        /> team,'' declared Claus, after a moment's thought. </p>
                    <p>"The Knook Prince allowed you as many as ten. Why not use them all?'' asked
                        Flossie. "Then we could speed like the lightning and leap to the highest
                        roofs with ease.'' </p>
                    <p>"A team of ten reindeer!'' cried Claus, delightedly. "That will be splendid.
                        Please return to the Forest at once and select eight other deer as like
                        yourselves as possible. And you must all eat of the casa plant, to become
                        strong, and of the grawle plant, to become fleet of foot, and of the marbon
                        plant, that you may live long to accompany me on my journeys. Likewise it
                        will be well for you to bathe in the Pool of Nares, which the lovely Queen
                        Zurline declares will render you rarely beautiful. Should you perform these
                        duties faithfully there is no doubt that on next Christmas Eve my ten
                        reindeer will be the most powerful and beautiful steeds the world has ever
                        seen!'' </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0213" n="158"/>
                    <p>So Glossie and Flossie went to the Forest to choose their mates, and Claus
                        began to consider the question of a harness for them all. </p>
                    <p>In the end he called upon Peter Knook for assistance, for Peter's heart is as
                        kind as his body is crooked, and he is remarkably shrewd as well. And Peter
                        agreed to furnish strips of tough leather for the harness. </p>
                    <p>This leather was cut from the skins of lions that had reached such an
                        advanced age that they died naturally, and on one side was tawny hair while
                        the other side was cured to the softness of velvet by the deft Knooks. When
                        Claus received these strips of leather he sewed them neatly into a harness
                        for the ten reindeer, and it proved strong and serviceable and lasted him
                        for many years. </p>
                    <p>The harness and sledge were prepared at odd times, for Claus devoted most of
                        his days to the making of toys. These were now much better than his first
                        ones had been, for the immortals <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0214" n="159"/>
                        often came to his house to watch him work and to offer suggestions. It was
                        Necile's idea to make some of the dolls say "papa'' and "mama.'' It was a
                        thought of the Knooks to put a squeak inside the lambs, so that when a child
                        squeezed them they would say "baa-a-a-a!'' And the Fairy Queen advised Claus
                        to put whistles in the birds, so they could be made to sing, and wheels on
                        the horses, so children could draw them around. Many animals perished in the
                        Forest, from one cause or another, and their fur was brought to Claus that
                        he might cover with it the small images of beasts he made for playthings. A
                        merry Ryl suggested that Claus make a donkey with a nodding head, which he
                        did, and afterward found that it amused the little ones immensely. And so
                        the toys grew in beauty and attractiveness every day, until they were the
                        wonder of even the immortals. </p>
                    <p>When another Christmas Eve drew near there was a monster load of beautiful
                        gifts for the <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0215" n="160"/> children ready to
                        be loaded upon the big sledge. Claus filled three sacks to the brim, and
                        tucked every corner of the sledge-box full of toys besides. </p>
                    <p>Then, at twilight, the ten reindeer appeared and Flossie introduced them all
                        to Claus. They were Racer and Pacer, Reckless and Speckless, Fearless and
                        Peerless, and Ready and Steady, who, with Glossie and Flossie, made up the
                        ten who have traversed the world these hundreds of years with their generous
                        master. They were all exceedingly beautiful, with slender limbs, spreading
                        antlers, velvety dark eyes and smooth coats of fawn color spotted with
                        white. </p>
                    <p>Claus loved them at once, and has loved them ever since, for they are loyal
                        friends and have rendered him priceless service. </p>
                    <p>The new harness fitted them nicely and soon they were all fastened to the
                        sledge by twos, with Glossie and Flossie in the lead. These wore the strings
                        of sleigh-bells, and were so <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0216" n="161"/>
                        delighted with the music they made that they kept prancing up and down to
                        make the bells ring. </p>
                    <p>Claus now seated himself in the sledge, drew a warm robe over his knees and
                        his fur cap over his ears, and cracked his long whip as a signal to start. </p>
                    <p>Instantly the ten leaped forward and were away like the wind, while jolly
                        Claus laughed gleefully to see them run and shouted a song in his big,
                        hearty voice:</p>

                    <lg type="verse">
                        <l>"With a ho, ho, ho!</l>
                        <l>And a ha, ha, ha!</l>
                        <l>And a ho, ho, ha, ha, hee</l>
                        <l>Now away we go</l>
                        <l>O'er the frozen snow,</l>
                        <l>As merry as we can be!</l>
                    </lg>

                    <lg type="verse">
                        <l>There are many joys</l>
                        <l>In our load of toys,</l>
                        <l>As many a child will know;</l>

                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0217" n="162"/>
                        <l>We'll scatter them wide</l>
                        <l>On our wild night ride</l>
                        <l>O'er the crisp and sparkling snow!''</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>Now it was on this same Christmas Eve that little Margot and her brother Dick
                        and her cousins Ned and Sara, who were visiting at Margot's house, came in
                        from making a snow man, with their clothes damp, their mittens dripping and
                        their shoes and stockings wet through and through. They were not scolded,
                        for Margot's mother knew the snow was melting, but they were sent early to
                        bed that their clothes might be hung over chairs to dry. The shoes were
                        placed on the red tiles of the hearth, where the heat from the hot embers
                        would strike them, and the stockings were carefully hung in a row by the
                        chimney, directly over the fireplace. That was the reason Santa Claus
                        noticed them when he came down the chimney that <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0218" n="163"/> night and all the household were
                        fast asleep. He was in a tremendous hurry and seeing the stockings all
                        belonged to children he quickly stuffed his toys into them and dashed up the
                        chimney again, appearing on the roof so suddenly that the reindeer were
                        astonished at his agility. </p>
                    <p>"I wish they would all hang up their stockings,'' he thought, as he drove to
                        the next chimney. "It would save me a lot of time and I could then visit
                        more children before daybreak.'' </p>
                    <p>When Margot and Dick and Ned and Sara jumped out of bed next morning and ran
                        downstairs to get their stockings from the fireplace they were filled with
                        delight to find the toys from Santa Claus inside them. In fact, I think they
                        found more presents in their stockings than any other children of that city
                        had received, for Santa Claus was in a hurry and did not stop to count the
                        toys. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0219" n="164"/>
                    <p>Of course they told all their little friends about it, and of course every
                        one of them decided to hang his own stockings by the fireplace the next
                        Christmas Eve. Even Bessie Blithesome, who made a visit to that city with
                        her father, the great Lord of Lerd, heard the story from the children and
                        hung her own pretty stockings by the chimney when she returned home at
                        Christmas time. </p>
                    <p>On his next trip Santa Claus found so many stockings hung up in anticipation
                        of his visit that he could fill them in a jiffy and be away again in half
                        the time required to hunt the children up and place the toys by their
                        bedsides. </p>
                    <p>The custom grew year after year, and has always been a great help to Santa
                        Claus. And, with so many children to visit, he surely needs all the help we
                        are able to give him. </p>

                    <head> CHAPTER TWELFTH: The first Christmas Tree</head>
                    <p> CLAUS has always kept his promise to the Knooks by returning to the Laughing
                        Valley by daybreak, but only the swiftness of his reindeer has enabled him
                        to do this, for he travels over all the world. </p>
                    <p>He loved his work and he loved the brisk night ride on his sledge and the gay
                        tinkle of the sleigh-bells. On that first trip with the ten reindeer only
                        Glossie and Flossie wore bells; but each year thereafter for eight years
                        Claus carried presents to the children of the Gnome King, and that
                        good-natured monarch gave him in return a string of bells at each visit, so
                        that finally every one of the ten deer was supplied, <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0221" n="166"/> and you may imagine what a merry
                        tune the bells played as the sledge sped over the snow. </p>
                    <p>The children's stockings were so long that it required a great many toys to
                        fill them, and soon Claus found there were other things besides toys that
                        children love. So he sent some of the Fairies, who were always his good
                        friends, into the Tropics, from whence they returned with great bags full of
                        oranges and bananas which they had plucked from the trees. And other Fairies
                        flew to the wonderful Valley of Phunnyland, where delicious candies and
                        bonbons grow thickly on the bushes, and returned laden with many boxes of
                        sweetmeats for the little ones. These things Santa Claus, on each Christmas
                        Eve, placed in the long stockings, together with his toys, and the children
                        were glad to get them, you may be sure. </p>
                    <p>There are also warm countries where there is no snow in winter, but Claus and
                        his reindeer visited them as well as the colder climes, for <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0222" n="167"/> there were little wheels inside
                        the runners of his sledge which permitted it to run as smoothly over bare
                        ground as on the snow. And the children who lived in the warm countries
                        learned to know the name of Santa Claus as well as those who lived nearer to
                        the Laughing Valley. </p>
                    <p>Once, just as the reindeer were ready to start on their yearly trip, a Fairy
                        came to Claus and told him of three little children who lived beneath a rude
                        tent of skins on a broad plain where there were no trees whatever. These
                        poor babies were miserable and unhappy, for their parents were ignorant
                        people who neglected them sadly. Claus resolved to visit these children
                        before he returned home, and during his ride he picked up the bushy top of a
                        pine tree which the wind had broken off and placed it in his sledge. </p>
                    <p>It was nearly morning when the deer stopped before the lonely tent of skins
                        where the poor children lay asleep. Claus at once planted the <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0223" n="168"/> bit of pine tree in the sand and
                        stuck many candles on the branches. Then he hung some of his prettiest toys
                        on the tree, as well as several bags of candies. It did not take long to do
                        all this, for Santa Claus works quickly, and when all was ready he lighted
                        the candles and, thrusting his head in at the opening of the tent, he
                        shouted: </p>
                    <p>"Merry Christmas, little ones!'' </p>
                    <p>With that he leaped into his sledge and was out of sight before the children,
                        rubbing the sleep from their eyes, could come out to see who had called
                        them. </p>

                    <p>You can imagine the wonder and joy of those little ones, who had never in
                        their lives known a real pleasure before, when they saw the tree, sparkling
                        with lights that shone brilliant in the gray dawn and hung with toys enough
                        to make them happy for years to come! They joined hands and danced around
                        the tree, shouting and laughing, until they were obliged to pause for <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0224" n="Illustration"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0225"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0226" n="169"/> breath. And their parents, also,
                        came out to look and wonder, and thereafter had more respect and
                        consideration for their children, since Santa Claus had honored them with
                        such beautiful gifts. </p>
                    <p>The idea of the Christmas tree pleased Claus, and so the following year he
                        carried many of them in his sledge and set them up in the homes of poor
                        people who seldom saw trees, and placed candles and toys on the branches. Of
                        course he could not carry enough trees in one load for all who wanted them,
                        but in some homes the fathers were able to get trees and have them all ready
                        for Santa Claus when he arrived; and these the good Claus always decorated
                        as prettily as possible and hung with toys enough for all the children who
                        came to see the tree lighted. </p>
                    <p>These novel ideas and the generous manner in which they were carried out made
                        the children long for that one night in the year when their friend Santa
                        Claus should visit them, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0227" n="170"/> as
                        such anticipation is very pleasant and comforting the little ones gleaned
                        much happiness by wondering what would happen when Santa Claus next arrived. </p>
                    <p>Perhaps you remember that stern Baron Braun who once drove Claus from his
                        castle and forbade him to visit his children? Well, many years afterward,
                        when the old Baron was dead and his son ruled in his place, the new Baron
                        Braun came to the house of Claus with his train of knights and pages and
                        henchmen and, dismounting from his charger, bared his head humbly before the
                        friend of children. </p>
                    <p>"My father did not know your goodness and worth,'' he said, "and therefore
                        threatened to hang you from the castle walls. But I have children of my own,
                        who long for a visit from Santa Claus, and I have come to beg that you will
                        favor them hereafter as you do other children.'' </p>
                    <p>Claus was pleased with this speech, for Castle <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0228" n="171"/> Braun was the only place he had
                        never visited, and he gladly promised to bring presents to the Baron's
                        children the next Christmas Eve. </p>
                    <p>The Baron went away contented, and Claus kept his promise faithfully. </p>
                    <p>Thus did this man, through very goodness, conquer the hearts of all; and it
                        is no wonder he was ever merry and gay, for there was no home in the wide
                        world where he was not welcomed more royally than any king. </p>

                    <head> CHAPTER FIRST: The Mantle of Immortality</head>
                    <p> AND now we come to a turning-point in the career of Santa Claus, and it is
                        my duty to relate the most remarkable circumstance that has happened since
                        the world began or mankind was created. </p>
                    <p>We have followed the life of Claus from the time he was found a helpless
                        infant by the Wood-Nymph Necile and reared to manhood in the great Forest of
                        Burzee. And we know how he began to make toys for children and how, with the
                        assistance and goodwill of the immortals, he was able to distribute them to
                        the little ones throughout the world. </p>
                    <p>For many years he carried on this noble <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0233"
                            n="176"/> work; for the simple, hard-working life he led gave him
                        perfect health and strength. And doubtless a man can live longer in the
                        beautiful Laughing Valley, where there are no cares and everything is
                        peaceful and merry, than in any other part of the world. </p>
                    <p>But when many years had rolled away Santa Claus grew old. The long beard of
                        golden brown that once covered his cheeks and chin gradually became gray,
                        and finally turned to pure white. His hair was white, too, and there were
                        wrinkles at the corners of his eyes, which showed plainly when he laughed.
                        He had never been a very tall man, and now he became fat, and waddled very
                        much like a duck when he walked. But in spite of these things he remained as
                        lively as ever, and was just as jolly and gay, and his kind eyes sparkled as
                        brightly as they did that first day when he came to the Laughing Valley. </p>
                    <p>Yet a time is sure to come when every mortal <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0234"
                            n="177"/> who has grown old and lived his life is required to leave this
                        world for another; so it is no wonder that, after Santa Claus had driven his
                        reindeer on many and many a Christmas Eve, those stanch friends finally
                        whispered among themselves that they had probably drawn his pledge for the
                        last time. </p>
                    <p>Then all the Forest of Burzee became sad and all the Laughing Valley was
                        hushed, for every living thing that had known Claus had used to love him and
                        to brighten at the sound of his footsteps or the notes of his merry whistle. </p>
                    <p>No doubt the old man's strength was at last exhausted, for he made no more
                        toys, but lay on his bed as in a dream. </p>
                    <p>The Nymph Necile, she who had reared him and been his foster-mother, was
                        still youthful and strong and beautiful, and it seemed to her but a short
                        time since this aged, gray bearded man had lain in her arms and smiled on
                        her with his innocent, baby lips. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0235" n="178"/>
                    <p>In this is shown the difference between mortals and immortals. </p>
                    <p>It was fortunate that the great Ak came to the Forest at that time. Necile
                        sought him with troubled eyes and told him of the fate that threatened their
                        friend Claus. </p>
                    <p>At once the Master became grave, and he leaned upon his ax and stroked his
                        grizzled beard thoughtfully for many minutes. Then suddenly he stood up
                        straight, and poised his powerful head with firm resolve, and stretched out
                        his great right arm as if determined on doing some mighty deed. For a
                        thought had come to him so grand in its conception that all the world might
                        well bow before the Master Woodsman and honor his name forever! </p>
                    <p>It is well known that when the great Ak once undertakes to do a thing he
                        never hesitates an instant. Now he summoned his fleetest messengers, and
                        sent them in a flash to many parts of the earth. And when they were gone he
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0236" n="179"/> turned to the anxious Necile
                        and comforted her, saying: </p>
                    <p>"Be of good heart, my child; our friend still lives. And now run to your
                        Queen and tell her that I have summoned a council of all the immortals of
                        the world to meet with me here in Burzee this night. If they obey, and
                        harken unto my words, Claus will drive his reindeer for countless ages yet
                        to come.'' </p>
                    <p>At midnight there was a wondrous scene in the ancient Forest of Burzee, where
                        for the first time in many centuries the rulers of the immortals who inhabit
                        the earth were gathered together. </p>
                    <p>There was the Queen of the Water Sprites, whose beautiful form was as clear
                        as crystal but continually dripped water on the bank of moss where she sat.
                        And beside her was the King of the Sleep Fays, who carried a wand from the
                        end of which a fine dust fell all around, so that no mortal could keep awake
                        long enough to <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0237" n="180"/> see him, as mortal
                        eyes were sure to close in sleep as soon as the dust filled them. And next
                        to him sat the Gnome King, whose people inhabit all that region under the
                        earth's surface, where they guard the precious metals and the jewel stones
                        that lie buried in rock and ore. At his right hand stood the King of the
                        Sound Imps, who had wings on his feet, for his people are swift to carry all
                        sounds that are made. When they are busy they carry the sounds but short
                        distances, for there are many of them; but sometimes they speed with the
                        sounds to places miles and miles away from where they are made. The King of
                        the Sound Imps had an anxious and careworn face, for most people have no
                        consideration for his Imps and, especially the boys and girls, make a great
                        many unnecessary sounds which the Imps are obliged to carry when they might
                        be better employed. </p>
                    <p>The next in the circle of immortals was the King of the Wind Demons, slender
                        of frame, <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0238" n="181"/> restless and uneasy at
                        being confined to one place for even an hour. Once in a while he would leave
                        his place and circle around the glade, and each time he did this the Fairy
                        Queen was obliged to untangle the flowing locks of her golden hair and tuck
                        them back of her pink ears. But she did not complain, for it was not often
                        that the King of the Wind Demons came into the heart of the Forest. After
                        the Fairy Queen, whose home you know was in old Burzee, came the King of the
                        Light Elves, with his two Princes, Flash and Twilight, at his back. He never
                        went anywhere without his Princes, for they were so mischievous that he
                        dared not let them wander alone. </p>
                    <p>Prince Flash bore a lightning-bolt in his right hand and a horn of gunpowder
                        in his left, and his bright eyes roved constantly around, as if he longed to
                        use his blinding flashes. Prince Twilight held a great snuffer in one hand
                        and a big black cloak in the other, and it is well known <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002462_0239" n="182"/> that unless Twilight is carefully
                        watched the snuffers or the cloak will throw everything into darkness, and
                        Darkness is the greatest enemy the King of the Light Elves has. </p>
                    <p>In addition to the immortals I have named were the King of the Knooks, who
                        had come from his home in the jungles of India; and the King of the Ryls,
                        who lived among the gay flowers and luscious fruits of Valencia. Sweet Queen
                        Zurline of the Wood-Nymphs completed the circle of immortals. </p>
                    <p>But in the center of the circle sat three others who possessed powers so
                        great that all the Kings and Queens showed them reverence. </p>
                    <p>These were Ak, the Master Woodsman of the World, who rules the forests and
                        the orchards and the groves; and Kern, the Master Husbandman of the World,
                        who rules the grain fields and the meadows and the gardens; and Bo, the
                        Master Mariner of the World, who rules the seas and all the craft that float
                        thereon. <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0240" n="183"/> And all other immortals
                        are more or less subject to these three. </p>
                    <p>When all had assembled the Master Woodsman of the World stood up to address
                        them, since he himself had summoned them to the council. </p>
                    <p>Very clearly he told them the story of Claus, beginning at the time when as a
                        babe he had been adopted a child of the Forest, and telling of his noble and
                        generous nature and his lifelong labors to make children happy. </p>
                    <p>"And now,'' said Ak, "when he has won the love of all the world, the Spirit
                        of Death is hovering over him. Of all men who have inhabited the earth none
                        other so well deserves immortality, for such a life can not be spared so
                        long as there are children of mankind to miss him and to grieve over his
                        loss. We immortals are the servants of the world, and to serve the world we
                        were permitted in the Beginning to exist. But what one of us is more worthy
                        of immortality than this man Claus, who so sweetly ministers to the little
                        children?'' </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0241" n="184"/>
                    <p>He paused and glanced around the circle, to find every immortal listening to
                        him eagerly and nodding approval. Finally the King of the Wind Demons, who
                        had been whistling softly to himself, cried out: </p>
                    <p>"What is your desire, O Ak?'' </p>
                    <p>"To bestow upon Claus the Mantle of Immortality!'' said Ak, boldly. </p>
                    <p>That this demand was wholly unexpected was proved by the immortals springing
                        to their feet and looking into each other's face with dismay and then upon
                        Ak with wonder. For it was a grave matter, this parting with the Mantle of
                        Immortality. </p>
                    <p>The Queen of the Water Sprites spoke in her low, clear voice, and the words
                        sounded like raindrops splashing upon a window-pane. </p>
                    <p>"In all the world there is but one Mantle of Immortality,'' she said. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0242" n="185"/>
                    <p>The King of the Sound Fays added: </p>
                    <p>"It has existed since the Beginning, and no mortal has ever dared to claim
                        it.'' </p>
                    <p>And the Master Mariner of the World arose and stretched his limbs, saying: </p>
                    <p>"Only by the vote of every immortal can it be bestowed upon a mortal.'' </p>
                    <p>"I know all this,'' answered Ak, quietly. "But the Mantle exists, and if it
                        was created, as you say, in the Beginning, it was because the Supreme Master
                        knew that some day it would be required. Until now no mortal has deserved
                        it, but who among you dares deny that the good Claus deserves it? Will you
                        not all vote to bestow it upon him?'' </p>
                    <p>They were silent, still looking upon one another questioningly. </p>
                    <p>"Of what use is the Mantle of Immortality unless it is worn?'' demanded Ak.
                        "What will it profit any one of us to allow it to remain in its lonely
                        shrine for all time to come?'' </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0243" n="186"/>
                    <p>"Enough!'' cried the Gnome King, abruptly. "We will vote on the matter, yes
                        or no. For my part, I say yes!'' </p>
                    <p>"And I!'' said the Fairy Queen, promptly, and Ak rewarded her with a smile. </p>
                    <p>"My people in Burzee tell me they have learned to love him; therefore I vote
                        to give Claus the Mantle,'' said the King of the Ryls. </p>
                    <p>"He is already a comrade of the Knooks,'' announced the ancient King of that
                        band. "Let him have immortality!'' </p>
                    <p>"Let him have it&mdash;let him have it!'' sighed the King of the Wind
                        Demons. </p>
                    <p>"Why not?'' asked the King of the Sleep Fays. "He never disturbs the slumbers
                        my people allow humanity. Let the good Claus be immortal!'' </p>
                    <p>"I do not object,'' said the King of the Sound Imps. </p>
                    <p>"Nor I,'' murmured the Queen of the Water Sprites. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0244" n="187"/>
                    <p>"If Claus does not receive the Mantle it is clear none other can ever claim
                        it,'' remarked the King of the Light Elves, "so let us have done with the
                        thing for all time.'' </p>
                    <p>"The Wood-Nymphs were first to adopt him,'' said Queen Zurline. "Of course I
                        shall vote to make him immortal.'' </p>
                    <p>Ak now turned to the Master Husbandman of the World, who held up his right
                        arm and said "Yes!'' </p>
                    <p>And the Master Mariner of the World did likewise, after which Ak, with
                        sparkling eyes and smiling face, cried out: </p>
                    <p>"I thank you, fellow immortals! For all have voted `yes,' and so to our dear
                        Claus shall fall the one Mantle of Immortality that it is in our power to
                        bestow!'' </p>
                    <p>"Let us fetch it at once,'' said the Fay King; "I'm in a hurry.'' </p>
                    <p>They bowed assent, and instantly the Forest glade was deserted. But in a
                        place midway <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0245" n="188"/> between the earth
                        and the sky was suspended a gleaming crypt of gold and platinum, aglow with
                        soft lights shed from the facets of countless gems. Within a high dome hung
                        the precious Mantle of Immortality, and each immortal placed a hand on the
                        hem of the splendid Robe and said, as with one voice: </p>
                    <p>"We bestow this Mantle upon Claus, who is called the Patron Saint of
                        Children!'' </p>
                    <p>At this the Mantle came away from its lofty crypt, and they carried it to the
                        house in the Laughing Valley. </p>
                    <p>The Spirit of Death was crouching very near to the bedside of Claus, and as
                        the immortals approached she sprang up and motioned them back with an angry
                        gesture. But when her eyes fell upon the Mantle they bore she shrank away
                        with a low moan of disappointment and quitted that house forever. </p>
                    <p>Softly and silently the immortal Band dropped upon Claus the precious Mantle,
                        and it closed 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0246" n="Illustration" />
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0247"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0248" n="189"/>
                        about him and sank into the outlines of his body and
                        disappeared from view. It became a part of his being, and neither mortal nor
                        immortal might ever take it from him. </p>
                    <p>Then the Kings and Queens who had wrought this great deed dispersed to their
                        various homes, and all were well contented that they had added another
                        immortal to their Band. </p>
                    <p>And Claus slept on, the red blood of everlasting life coursing swiftly
                        through his veins; and on his brow was a tiny drop of water that had fallen
                        from the ever-melting gown of the Queen of the Water Sprites, and over his
                        lips hovered a tender kiss that had been left by the sweet Nymph Necile. For
                        she had stolen in when the others were gone to gaze with rapture upon the
                        immortal form of her foster son. </p>

                    <head> CHAPTER SECOND: When the World Grew Old</head>
                    <p> THE next morning, when Santa Claus opened his eyes and gazed around the
                        familiar room, which he had feared he might never see again, he was
                        astonished to find his old strength renewed and to feel the red blood of
                        perfect health coursing through his veins. He sprang from his bed and stood
                        where the bright sunshine came in through his window and flooded him with
                        its merry, dancing rays. He did not then understand what had happened to
                        restore to him the vigor of youth, but in spite of the fact that his beard
                        remained the color of snow and that wrinkles still lingered in the corners
                        of his bright eyes, old Santa Claus 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0250" n="191"/>
                        felt as brisk and merry as a boy of
                        sixteen, and was soon whistling contentedly as he busied himself fashioning
                        new toys. </p>
                    <p>Then Ak came to him and told of the Mantle of Immortality and how Claus had
                        won it through his love for little children. </p>
                    <p>It made old Santa look grave for a moment to think he had been so favored;
                        but it also made him glad to realize that now he need never fear being
                        parted from his dear ones. At once he began preparations for making a
                        remarkable assortment of pretty and amusing playthings, and in larger
                        quantities than ever before; for now that he might always devote himself to
                        this work he decided that no child in the world, poor or rich, should
                        hereafter go without a Christmas gift if he could manage to supply it. </p>
                    <p>The world was new in the days when dear old Santa Claus first began
                        toy-making and won, by his loving deeds, the Mantle of Immortality. And the
                        task of supplying cheering 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0251" n="192"/>
                        words, sympathy and pretty playthings to all the
                        young of his race did not seem a difficult undertaking at all. But every
                        year more and more children were born into the world, and these, when they
                        grew up, began spreading slowly over all the face of the earth, seeking new
                        homes; so that Santa Claus found each year that his journeys must extend
                        farther and farther from the Laughing Valley, and that the packs of toys
                        must be made larger and ever larger. </p>
                    <p>So at length he took counsel with his fellow immortals how his work might
                        keep pace with the increasing number of children that none might be
                        neglected. And the immortals were so greatly interested in his labors that
                        they gladly rendered him their assistance. Ak gave him his man Kilter, "the
                        silent and swift.'' And the Knook Prince gave him Peter, who was more
                        crooked and less surly than any of his brothers. And the Ryl Prince gave him
                        Nuter, the sweetest tempered Ryl ever known. And the Fairy 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0252" n="193"/>
                        Queen gave him
                        Wisk, that tiny, mischievous but lovable Fairy who knows today almost as
                        many children as does Santa Claus himself. </p>
                    <p>With these people to help make the toys and to keep his house in order and to
                        look after the sledge and the harness, Santa Claus found it much easier to
                        prepare his yearly load of gifts, and his days began to follow one another
                        smoothly and pleasantly. </p>
                    <p>Yet after a few generations his worries were renewed, for it was remarkable
                        how the number of people continued to grow, and how many more children there
                        were every year to be served. When the people filled all the cities and
                        lands of one country they wandered into another part of the world; and the
                        men cut down the trees in many of the great forests that had been ruled by
                        Ak, and with the wood they built new cities, and where the forests had been
                        were fields of grain and herds of browsing cattle. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0253" n="194"/>
                    <p>You might think the Master Woodsman would rebel at the loss of his forests;
                        but not so. The wisdom of Ak was mighty and farseeing. </p>
                    <p>"The world was made for men,'' said he to Santa Claus, "and I have but
                        guarded the forests until men needed them for their use. I am glad my strong
                        trees can furnish shelter for men's weak bodies, and warm them through the
                        cold winters. But I hope they will not cut down all the trees, for mankind
                        needs the shelter of the woods in summer as much as the warmth of blazing
                        logs in winter. And, however crowded the world may grow, I do not think men
                        will ever-come to Burzee, nor to the Great Black Forest, nor to the wooded
                        wilderness of Braz; unless they seek their shades for pleasure and not to
                        destroy their giant trees.'' </p>
                    <p>By and by people made ships from the tree-trunks and crossed over oceans and
                        built cities in far lands; but the oceans made little difference to the
                        journeys of Santa Claus. His 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0254" n="195"/>
                        reindeer sped over the waters as swiftly as
                        over land, and his sledge headed from east to west and followed in the wake
                        of the sun. So that as the earth rolled slowly over Santa Claus had all of
                        twenty-four hours to encircle it each Christmas Eve, and the speedy reindeer
                        enjoyed these wonderful journeys more and more. </p>
                    <p>So year after year, and generation after generation, and century after
                        century, the world grew older and the people became more numerous and the
                        labors of Santa Claus steadily increased. The fame of his good deeds spread
                        to every household where children dwelt. And all the little ones loved him
                        dearly; and the fathers and mothers honored him for the happiness he had
                        given them when they too were young; and the aged grandsires and granddames
                        remembered him with tender gratitude and blessed his name. </p>

                    <head> CHAPTER THIRD: The Deputies of Santa Claus</head>
                    <p> HOWEVER, there was one evil following in the path of civilization that
                        caused Santa Claus a vast amount of trouble before he discovered a way to
                        overcome it. But, fortunately, it was the last trial he was forced to
                        undergo. </p>
                    <p>One Christmas Eve, when his reindeer had leaped to the top of a new building,
                        Santa Claus was surprised to find that the chimney had been built much
                        smaller than usual. But he had no time to think about it just then, so he
                        drew in his breath and made himself as small as possible and slid down the
                        chimney. </p>
                    <p>"I ought to be at the bottom by this time,'' 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0256" n="197"/>
                        he thought, as he continued to
                        slip downward; but no fireplace of any sort met his view, and by and by he
                        reached the very end of the chimney, which was in the cellar. </p>
                    <p>"This is odd!'' he reflected, much puzzled by this experience. "If there is
                        no fireplace, what on earth is the chimney good for?'' </p>
                    <p>Then he began to climb out again, and found it hard work&mdash;the space
                        being so small. And on his way up he noticed a thin, round pipe sticking
                        through the side of the chimney, but could not guess what it was for. </p>
                    <p>Finally he reached the roof and said to the reindeer: </p>
                    <p>"There was no need of my going down that chimney, for I could find no
                        fireplace through which to enter the house. I fear the children who live
                        there must go without playthings this Christmas.'' </p>
                    <p>Then he drove on, but soon came to another new house with a small chimney.
                        This caused 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0257" n="198"/>
                        Santa Claus to shake his head doubtfully, but he tried the
                        chimney, nevertheless, and found it exactly like the other. Moreover, he
                        nearly stuck fast in the narrow flue and tore his jacket trying to get out
                        again; so, although he came to several such chimneys that night, he did not
                        venture to descend any more of them. </p>
                    <p>"What in the world are people thinking of, to build such useless chimneys?''
                        he exclaimed. "In all the years I have traveled with my reindeer I have
                        never seen the like before.'' </p>
                    <p>True enough; but Santa Claus had not then discovered that stoves had been
                        invented and were fast coming into use. When he did find it out he wondered
                        how the builders of those houses could have so little consideration for him,
                        when they knew very well it was his custom to climb down chimneys and enter
                        houses by way of the fireplaces. Perhaps the men who built those houses had
                        outgrown their own love for toys, and were indifferent whether Santa 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0258" n="199"/>
                        Claus
                        called on their children or not. Whatever the explanation might be, the poor
                        children were forced to bear the burden of grief and disappointment. </p>
                    <p>The following year Santa Claus found more and more of the new-fashioned
                        chimneys that had no fireplaces, and the next year still more. The third
                        year, so numerous had the narrow chimneys become, he even had a few toys
                        left in his sledge that he was unable to give away, because he could not get
                        to the children. </p>
                    <p>The matter had now become so serious that it worried the good man greatly,
                        and he decided to talk it over with Kilter and Peter and Nuter and Wisk. </p>
                    <p>Kilter already knew something about it, for it had been his duty to run
                        around to all the houses, just before Christmas, and gather up the notes and
                        letters to Santa Claus that the children had written, telling what they
                        wished put in their stockings or hung on their 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0259" n="200"/>
                        Christmas trees. But Kilter
                        was a silent fellow, and seldom spoke of what he saw in the cities and
                        villages. The others were very indignant. </p>
                    <p>"Those people act as if they do not wish their children to be made happy!''
                        said sensible Peter, in a vexed tone. "The idea of shutting out such a
                        generous friend to their little ones!'' </p>
                    <p>"But it is my intention to make children happy whether their parents wish it
                        or not,'' returned Santa Claus. "Years ago, when I first began making toys,
                        children were even more neglected by their parents than they are now; so I
                        have learned to pay no attention to thoughtless or selfish parents, but to
                        consider only the longings of childhood.'' </p>
                    <p>"You are right, my master,'' said Nuter, the Ryl; "many children would lack a
                        friend if you did not consider them, and try to make them happy.'' </p>
                    <p>"Then,'' declared the laughing Wisk, "we must abandon any thought of using
                        these new, 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0260" n="201"/>
                        fashioned chimneys, but become burglars, and break into the
                        houses some other way.'' </p>
                    <p>"What way?'' asked Santa Claus. </p>
                    <p>"Why, walls of brick and wood and plaster are nothing to Fairies. I can
                        easily pass through them whenever I wish, and so can Peter and Nuter and
                        Kilter. Is it not so, comrades?'' </p>
                    <p>"I often pass through the walls when I gather up the letters,'' said Kilter,
                        and that was a long speech for him, and so surprised Peter and Nuter that
                        their big round eyes nearly popped out of their heads. </p>
                    <p>"Therefore,'' continued the Fairy, "you may as well take us with you on your
                        next journey and when we come to one of those houses with stoves instead of
                        fireplaces we will distribute the toys to the children without the need of
                        using a chimney.'' </p>
                    <p>"That seems to me a good plan,'' replied Santa Claus, well pleased at having
                        solved the problem. "We will try it next year.'' </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0261" n="202"/>
                    <p>That was how the Fairy, the Pixie, the Knook and the Ryl all rode in the
                        sledge with their master the following Christmas Eve; and they had no
                        trouble at all in entering the new fashioned houses and leaving toys for the
                        children that lived in them. </p>
                    <p>And their deft services not only relieved Santa Claus of much labor, but
                        enabled him to complete his own work more quickly than usual, so that the
                        merry party found themselves at home with an empty sledge a full hour before
                        daybreak. </p>
                    <p>The only drawback to the journey was that the mischievous Wisk persisted in
                        tickling the reindeer with a long feather, to see them jump; and Santa Claus
                        found it necessary to watch him every minute and to tweak his long ears once
                        or twice to make him behave himself. </p>
                    <p>But, taken all together, the trip was a great success, and to this day the
                        four little folk always accompany Santa Claus on his yearly ride and help
                        him in the distribution of his gifts. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0262" n="203"/>
                    <p>But the indifference of parents, which had so annoyed the good Saint, did not
                        continue very long, and Santa Claus soon found they were really anxious he
                        should visit their homes on Christmas Eve and leave presents for their
                        children. </p>
                    <p>So, to lighten his task, which was fast becoming very difficult indeed, old
                        Santa decided to ask the parents to assist him. </p>
                    <p>"Get your Christmas trees all ready for my coming,'' he said to them; "and
                        then I shall be able to leave the presents without loss of time, and you can
                        put them on the trees when I am gone. </p>
                    <p>And to others he said: "See that the children's stockings are hung up in
                        readiness for my coming, and then I can fill them as quick as a wink.'' </p>
                    <p>And often, when parents were kind and good-natured, Santa Claus would simply
                        fling down his package of gifts and leave the fathers and 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0263" n="204"/>
                        mothers to fill
                        the stockings after he had darted away in his sledge. </p>
                    <p>"I will make all loving parents my deputies!'' cried the jolly old fellow,
                        "and they shall help me do my work. For in this way I shall save many
                        precious minutes and few children need be neglected for lack of time to
                        visit them.'' </p>
                    <p>Besides carrying around the big packs in his swift-flying sledge old Santa
                        began to send great heaps of toys to the toy-shops, so that if parents
                        wanted larger supplies for their children they could easily get them; and if
                        any children were, by chance, missed by Santa Claus on his yearly rounds,
                        they could go to the toy-shops and get enough to make them happy and
                        contented. For the loving friend of the little ones decided that no child,
                        if he could help it, should long for toys in vain. And the toy-shops also
                        proved convenient whenever a child fell ill, and needed a new toy to amuse
                        it; and sometimes, on birthdays, the fathers and mothers go to the toy-shops
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0264" n="Illustration"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0265"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0266" n="205"/>
                        
                        and get pretty gifts for their children in honor of the happy event </p>
                    <p>Perhaps you will now understand how, in spite of the bigness of the world,
                        Santa Claus is able to supply all the children with beautiful gifts. To be
                        sure, the old gentleman is rarely seen in these days; but it is not because
                        he tries to keep out of sight, I assure you. Santa Claus is the same loving
                        friend of children that in the old days used to play and romp with them by
                        the hour; and I know he would love to do the same now, if he had the time.
                        But, you see, he is so busy all the year making toys, and so hurried on that
                        one night when he visits our homes with his packs, that he comes and goes
                        among us like a flash; and it is almost impossible to catch a glimpse of
                        him. </p>
                    <p>And, although there are millions and millions more children in the world than
                        there used to be, Santa Claus has never been known to complain of their
                        increasing numbers. </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002462_0267" n="206"/>
                    <p>"The more the merrier!'' he cries, with his jolly laugh; and the only
                        difference to him is the fact that his little workmen have to make their
                        busy fingers fly faster every year to satisfy the demands of so many little
                        ones. </p>
                    <p>"In all this world there is nothing so beautiful as a happy child,'' says
                        good old Santa Claus; and if he had his way the children would all be
                        beautiful, for all would be happy. </p>
