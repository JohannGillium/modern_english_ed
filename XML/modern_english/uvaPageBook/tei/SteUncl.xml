                    <p>It is unclear exactly which edition Charles Keller used to create the
                        electronic text. The 1905 edition (same pagination) used to verify the
                        electronic text does not contain advertisements in the original etext. Thus,
                        the advertisements included herein have not been checked by the Electronic
                        Text Center. Otherwise, the text has been made to conform to the 1905
                        edition.</p>

                <p>The one particular object in writing this book is to furnish you with an
                    occasional laugh, and the writer with an occasional dollar. If you get the laugh
                    you have your equivalent, and the writer has his.</p>

                <p>In Uncle Josh Weathersby you have a purely imaginary character, yet one true to
                    life. A character chuck full of sunshine and rural simplicity. Take him as you
                    find him, and in his experiences you will observe there is a bright side to
                    everything.</p>

                </head>

                <p>THE author was born in Virginia, on a little patch of land, so poor we had to
                    fertilize it to make brick. Our family, while having cast their fortunes with
                    the South, was not a family ruined by the war; we did not have anything when the
                    war commenced, and so we held our own. I secured a common school education, and
                    at the age of twelve I left home, or rather home left me&mdash;things just
                    petered out. I was slush cook on an Ohio River Packet; check clerk in a stave
                    and heading camp in the knobs of Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia; I helped lay
                    the track of the M. K. &amp; T. R. R., and was chambermaid in a livery
                    stable. Made my first appearance on the stage at the National Theatre in
                    Cincinnati, Ohio, and have since then chopped cord wood, worked in a coal mine,
                    made cross ties (and walked them), worked on a farm, taught a district school
                    (made love to the big girls), run a <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0021" n="8"/> threshing machine, cut bands,
                    fed the machine and ran the engine. Have been a freight and passenger brakeman,
                    fired and ran a locomotive; also a freight train conductor and check clerk in a
                    freight house; worked on the section; have been a shot gun messenger for the
                    Wells, Fargo Company. Have been with a circus, minstrels, farce comedy,
                    burlesque and dramatic productions; have been with good shows, bad shows,
                    medicine shows, and worse, and some shows where we had landlords singing in the
                    chorus. Have played variety houses and vaudeville houses; have slept in a box
                    car one night, and a swell hotel the next; have been a traveling salesman (could
                    spin as many yarns as any of them). For the past four years have made the Uncle
                    Josh stories for the talking machine. The Lord only knows what next!</p>

                </head>

                <p>WALL, fer a long time I had my mind made up that I'd cum down to New York, and so
                    a short time ago, as I had my crops all gathered in and produce sold I
                    calculated as how it would be a good time to come down here. Folks at home said
                    I'd be buncoed or have my pockets picked fore I'd bin here mor'n half an hour;
                    wall, I fooled 'em a little bit, I wuz here three days afore they buncoed me. I
                    spose as how there are a good many of them thar bunco fellers around New York,
                    but I tell you them thar street keer conductors take mighty good care on you. I
                    wuz ridin' along in one of them keers, had my pockit book right in my hand, I
                    alowed no feller would pick my pockits and git it long as I had it in my hand,
                    and it shet up tight as a barrel when the cider's workin'. Wall that conductor
                    feller <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0029" n="16"/> he jest kept his eye on me, and every little bit he'd put
                    his head in the door and say "hold fast." But I'm transgressin' from what I
                    started to tell ye. I wuz ridin' along in one of them sleepin' keers comin'
                    here, and along in the night some time I felt a feller rummagin' around under my
                    bed, and I looked out jest in time to see him goin' away with my boots, wall I
                    knowed the way that train wuz a runnin' he couldn't git off with them without
                    breakin' his durned neck, but in about half an hour he brot them back, guess
                    they didn't fit him. Wall I wuz sort of glad he took em cause he hed em all
                    shined up slicker 'n a new tin whistle. Wall when I got up in the mornin' my
                    trubbles commenced. I wuz so crouded up like, durned if I could git my clothes
                    on, and when I did git em on durned if my pants wa'nt on hind side afore, and my
                    socks got all tangled up in that little fish net along side of the bed and I
                    couldn't git em out, and I lost a bran new collar button that I traded Si
                    Pettingill a huskin' peg fer, and I got my right boot on my left foot and the
                    left one on the right foot, and I wuz so durned badly mixed up I didn't know
                    which way the train wuz a runnin', and I bumped my head on the roof <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0030" n="17"/>
                    of the bed over me, and then sot down right suddin like to think it over when
                    some feller cum along and stepped right squar on my bunion and I let out a war
                    whoop you could a heerd over in the next county. Wall, along cum that durned
                    porter and told me I wuz a wakin' up everybody in the keer. Then I started in to
                    hunt fer my collar button, cause I sot a right smart store by that button, thar
                    warns another one like it in Punkin Centre, and I thought it would be kind of
                    doubtful if they'd have any like it in New York, wall I see one stuck right in
                    the wall so I tried to git it out with my jack knife, when along came that
                    durned black jumpin' jack dressed in soldier clothes and ast me what I wanted,
                    and I told him I didn't want anything perticler, then he told me to quit ringin'
                    the bell, guess he wuz a little crazy, I didn't see no bell. Wall, finally I got
                    my clothes on and went into a room whar they had a row of little troughs to wash
                    in, and fast as I could pump water in the durned thing it run out of a little
                    hole in the bottom of the trough so I jest had to grab a handful and then pump
                    some more. Wall after that things went along purty well fer a right smart while,
                    then I et a snack out of my carpet bag and <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0031" n="18"/> felt purty good. Wall
                    that train got to runnin' slower and slower 'till it stopped at every house and
                    when it cum to a double house it stopped twice. I hed my ticket in my hat and I
                    put my head out of the window to look at suthin' when the wind blew my hat off
                    and I lost the durned old ticket, wall the conductor made me buy another one. I
                    hed to buy two tickets to ride once, but I fooled him, he don't know a durned
                    thing about it and when he finds it out he's goin to be the maddest conductor on
                    that railroad, I got a round trip ticket and I ain't a goin' back on his durned
                    old road. When I got off the ferry boat down here I commenced to think I wuz
                    about the best lookin' old feller what ever cum to New York, thar wuz a lot of
                    fellers down thar with buggies and kerridges and one thing and another, and jest
                    the minnit they seen me they all commenced to
                    holler&mdash;handsome&mdash;handsome. I didn't know I wuz so durned good
                    lookin'. One feller tried to git my carpet bag and another tried to git my
                    umbreller, and I jest told 'em to stand back or durned if I wouldn't take a
                    wrestle out of one or two of them, then I asked one of 'em if he could haul me
                    up to the Sturtevessant hotel, and by gosh I never <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0032" n="19"/> heered a feller stutter like that feller did in all my life, he said
                    ye-ye-ye-yes sir, and I said wall how much air you a goin' to charge me, and he
                    said f-f-f-fif-fif-fifty c-c-cents, and I sed wall I guess I'll ride with you,
                    but don't <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0033" n="20"/> stop to talk about it any more cause I'd kinder like to
                    git thar. Wall we started out and when we stopped we wuz away up at the other
                    end of the town whar thar warn't many houses, and I sed to him, this here ain't
                    the Sturtevessant hotel, and he sed n-n-n-no s-s-n-n-no sir, I sed why didn't
                    you let me out at the hotel like I told ye, and he sed, b-b-b-be c-c-c
                    b-b-because I c-c-c-c-couldn't s-s-s-say w-w-w-whoa q-q-q-q-quick enough. Wall I
                    hed a great time with that feller, but I got here at last.</p>

                <p>WALL, I did'nt suppose when I cum down here to New York that I wuz a goin to flop
                    right into the middle of high toned society, but I guess that's jist about what
                    I done. You see I had an old friend a livin' down here named Henry Higgins, and
                    I wanted to see Henry mighty bad. Henry and me, we wuz boys together down home
                    at Punkin Centre, and I hadn't seen him in a long time. Wall, I got a feller to
                    look up his name in the city almanac, and he showed me whar Henry lived, away up
                    on a street called avenue five. Wall when I seen Henry's house it jist about
                    took my breath away, I wuz that clar sot back. Henry's house is a good deal
                    bigger'n the court house at Punkin Centre. Wall at first I didn't know whether
                    to go in or not, but finally I mustered up my courage, and I went up and rang
                    some new fangled door bell, when a feller with knee britches on cum out and <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0035"
                        n="22"/> wanted to know who it wuz I wanted to see. Gosh I couldn't say
                    anything fer about a minnit, that feller jist looked to me like a picter I'd
                    seen in a story book. Wall finally I told him I wanted to see Henry Higgins, if
                    it wuz the same Henry I used to know down home at Punkin Centre. Wall I guess
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0036" n="23"/> Henry he must a heered me talkin', cause he jist cum out and
                    grabbed me by both hands and sed, "why Josh Weathersby, how do you do, cum right
                    in." Wall he took me into the house and introduced me to more wimmin folks than
                    I ever seen before in all my life at one time. I guess they were havin' some
                    kind of society doins at Henry's house, one old lady sed to me, "my dear Mr.
                    Weathersby, I am so pleased to meet you, I've heered Mr. Higgins speak about you
                    so often." Wall by chowder, I got to blushin' so it cum pretty near settin' my
                    hair on fire, but I sed, wall now I'm right glad to know you, you kind-er put me
                    in mind of old Nancy Smith down hum, and Nancy, she's bin tryin' to git married
                    past forty seasons that I kin remember on. Wall Henry took me off into a room by
                    myself, and when I got on my store clothes and my new calf skin boots, I tell
                    you I looked about as scrimptious as any of them. Wall they had a dance, I think
                    they called it a cowtillion, and that wuz whar I wuz right to hum, I jist hopped
                    out on the floor, balanced to partners, swung on the corners, and cut up more
                    capers than any young feller thar, it jist looked as if all the ladies wanted to
                    dance <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0037" n="24"/> with me. One lady wanted to know if I danced the german, but
                    I told her I only danced in English.</p>

                <p>Wall after that we had something to eat in the dinin' room, and I hadn't any
                    more'n got sot down and got to eatin right good, when that durn fool with the
                    knee britches on insulted me, he handed me a little wash bowl with a towel round
                    it, and I told him he needn't cast any insinuations at me, cause I washed my
                    hands afore I cum in. If it hadn't a bin in Henry's house I'd took a wrestle out
                    of him. Wall they had a lot of furrin dishes, sumthin what they called beef all
                    over mud, and another what they called a-charlotte russia-a little shavin' mug
                    made out of cake and full of sweetened lather, wall that was mighty good eatin',
                    though it took a lot of them, they wasn't very fillin'. Then they handed me
                    somethin' what they called ice cream, looked to me like a hunk of casteel soap,
                    wall I stuck my fork in it and tried to bite it, and it slipped off and got
                    inside my vest, and in less than a minnit I wuz froze from my chin to my toes. I
                    guess I cut a caper at Henry's house.</p>

                <p>I S'POSE I got tangled up the other day with the dogondest lookin' critter I
                    calculate I ever seen in all my born days, and I've bin around purty
                    considerable. I'd seen all sorts of cooriosoties and monstrosities in cirkuses
                    and meenagerys, but that wuz the fust time I'd ever seen a critter with his head
                    and tail on the same end. You see I sed to a feller, now whar abouts in New York
                    do you folks git your washin' done; when I left hum to come down here I lowed I
                    had enuff with me to do me, but I've stayed here a little longer than I
                    calculated to, and if I don't git some washin' done purty soon, I'll have to go
                    and jump in the river.</p>

                <p>Wall he wuz a bligin sort of a feller, and he told me thar wuz a place round the
                    corner whar a feller done all the washin', so I went round, and there was a sine
                    on the winder what sed Hop Quick, or Hop Soon, <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0039" n="26"/> or jump up and hop, or some other kind of a durned hop; and then thar
                    wuz a lot of figers on the winder that I couldn't make head nor tail on; it jist
                    looked to me like a chicken with mud on its feet had walked over that winder.</p>

                <p>Wall I went in to see bout gittin' my <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0040" n="27"/> washin' done, and gosh all
                    spruce gum, thar was one of them pig tailed heathen Chineeze, he jist looked fer
                    all the world like a picter on Aunt Nancy Smith's tea cups. I wuz sort of sot
                    back fer a minnit, coz 'I sed to myself&mdash;I don't spose this durned
                    critter can talk English; but seein' as how I'm in here, I might as well find
                    out. So I told him I'd like to git him to do some washin' fer me, and he
                    commenced a talkin' some outlandish lingo, sounded to me like cider runnin' out
                    of a jug, somethin' like&mdash;ung tong oowong lang kai moi oo ung wa, velly
                    good washee. Wall I understood the last of it and jist took his word fer the
                    rest, so I giv him my clothes and he giv me a little yaller ticket that he
                    painted with a brush what he had, and I'll jist bet a yoke of steers agin the
                    holler in a log, that no livin' mortal man could read that ticket; it looked
                    like a fly had fell into the ink bottle and then crawled over the paper. Wall I
                    showed it to a gentleman what was a standin' thar when I cum out, and I sed to
                    him&mdash;mister, what in thunder is this here thing, and he sed "Wall sir
                    that's a sort of a lotery ticket; every time you leave your clothes thar to have
                    them washed you git one of them tickets, and then you have a <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0041" n="28"/> chance
                    to draw a prize of some kind." So I sed&mdash;wall now I want to know, how
                    much is the blamed thing wuth, and he sed "I spose bout ten cents," and I told
                    him if he wanted my chants for ten cents he could hav it, I didn't want to get
                    tangled up in any lotery gamblin' bizness with that saucer faced scamp. So he
                    giv me ten cents and he took the ticket, and in a couple of days I went round to
                    git my washin', and that pig tailed heathen he wouldn't let me hev em, coz I'd
                    lost that lotery ticket. So I sed&mdash;now look here Mr. Hop Soon, if you
                    don't hop round and git me my collars and ciffs and other clothes what I left
                    here, I'll be durned if I don't flop you in about a minnit, I will by chowder.
                    Wall that critter he commenced hoppin around and a talkin faster 'n a buzz saw
                    could turn, and all I could make out wuz&mdash;mee song lay tang moo me oo
                    lay ung yong wo say mee tickee. Wall I seen jist as plain as could be that he
                    wuz a tryin' to swindle me outen my clothes, so I made a grab fer him, and in
                    less 'n a minnit we wuz a rollin' round on the floor; fust I wuz on top, and
                    then Mr. Hop Soon wuz on top, and you couldn't hav told which one of us the pig
                    tail belonged to. We upset the stove <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0042" n="29"/> and kicked out the winder, and
                    I sot Mr. Hop Soon in the wash tub, and when I got out of thar I had somebody's
                    washin' in one hand and about five yards of that pig tail in tother, and Mr. Hop
                    Soon, he wuz standin' thar yellin'&mdash;ung wa moo ye song ki le yung noy
                    song oowe pelecee, pelecee, pelecee. I had quite a time with that heathen
                    critter.</p>

                <p>WHEN I wuz in New York one day I wuz a walkin' along down the street when I cum
                    to a theater or play doins' of some kind or other, so I got to lookin' at the
                    picters, and I noticed whar it sed it only cost ten cents to go in, and I alowed
                    I might as well go in and see it. Wall I don't spose I'd bin in thar over five
                    minutes afore I made myself the laffin' stock of every one in thar. I noticed a
                    feller a sottin' thar gittin' his boots blacked, and thar was a durned little
                    pick pockit a pickin' his pockits. Wall I didn't want to see him git robbed, so
                    I went right up to him and I sed&mdash;look out mister, you air gittin' your
                    pockits picked, wall sir, that durned cuss never sed a word and every body
                    commenced to laff, and I looked round to see what they wuz a laffin' at, and it
                    wan't no man at all, nothin' only a durned old wax figger. I never felt so
                    durned foolish since the day I popped the question to Samantha. <pb

                    Wall then I looked round a spell longer, and thar wuz a feller what they called
                    the human pin cushion, and he wuz stuck chock full of needles and pins and
                    looked like a hedge hog; he'd be a mighty handy feller at a quiltin'. Wall, then
                    a feller cum along and sed, "everybody over to this end of the hall." Wall, I
                    went along with the rest of them, and durn my buttins if thar wa'nt a feller
                    what had more picters painted on him than thar is in a story book. Wall, I'd
                    jist got to lookin' at him when that feller what had charge sed, "right this way
                    everybody," and we all went into whar they wuz havin' the theater doins', and I
                    got sot down and a feller cum out and sung a song I hadn't heered since I wuz a
                    youngster. Neer as I kin remember it wuz this way&mdash;</p>

                    talked! He wuz a whole show all to himself. Wall, I bought one of them birds
                    from a feller one time&mdash;he said it wuz a good talker. Wall, I took it
                    hum and hed it about three months, and it never sed a durned word. I put in most
                    of my spare time tryin' to git it to say "Uncle Josh," but the durned critter
                    wouldn't do it, so I got mad at him one day and throwed him out in the barn yard
                    amongst the chickens, and left him thar. Wall, when I went out the next mornin',
                    I tell you thar wuz a sight. Half of them chickens wuz dead, and the rest of 'em
                    wuz skeered to death, and that durned parrit had a rooster by the neck up agin
                    the barn, and jist a givin' him an awful whippin', and every time he'd hit him
                    he'd say, "Now you say Uncle Josh, gol durn you, you say Uncle Josh."</p>

                <p>I USED to read in our town paper down home at Punkin Centre a whole lot about
                    Wall street and them bulls and bears, and one thing and another, so I jist sed
                    to myself&mdash;now Joshua, when you git down to New York City, that's jist
                    what you want to see. Wall, when I got to New York, I got a feller to show me
                    whar it wuz, and I'll be durned if I know why they call it Wall street; it
                    didn't hav any wall round it. I walked up and down it bout an hour and a half,
                    and I couldn't find any stock exchange or see any place fer watterin' any stock.
                    I couldn't see a pig nor a cow, nor a sheep nor a calf, or anything else that
                    looked like stock to me. So finally I sed to a gentleman&mdash;Mister, whar
                    do they keep the menagery down here. He sed "what menagery?" I sed the place
                    whar they've got all them bulls and bears a fitin'. Wall he looked at me as
                    though he thought I wuz crazy, <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0049" n="36"/> and I guess he did, but he sed "you
                    cum along with me, guess I can show you what you want to see." Wall I went along
                    with him, and he took me up to some public institushun, near as I could make out
                    it wuz a loonytick asylem. Wall he took me into a room about two akers and a
                    half squar, and thar wuz about two thousand of the crazyest men in thar I ever
                    seen in all my life. The minnit I sot eyes on them I knowed they wuz all crazy,
                    and I'd hav to umer them if I got out of thar alive. One feller wuz a standin'
                    on the top of a table with a lot of papers in his hand, and a yellin' like a
                    Comanche injin, and all the rest of them wuz tryin' to git at him. Finally I sed
                    to one of 'em&mdash;Mister, what are you a tryin' to do with that feller up
                    thar on the table? And he sed, "Wall he's got five thousand bushels of wheat and
                    we are tryin' to git it away from him." Wall, jist the minnit he sed that I
                    knowed fer certain they wuz all crazy, cos nobody but a crazy man would ever
                    think he had five thousand bushels of wheat in his coat and pants pockits. Wall
                    when they wan't a looking I got out of thar, and I felt mighty thankful to git
                    out. There wuz a feller standin' on the front steps; he had a <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0050" n="37"/> sort
                    of a unyform on; I guess he wuz Superintendent of the institushun; he talked
                    purty sassy to me. I sed, Mister, what time does the fust car go up town. He sed
                    "the fust one went about twenty-five years ago." I sed to him&mdash;is that
                    my car over thar? He sed "no sir, that car belongs to the street car company." I
                    sez, wall guess I'll take it anyhow. He says "you'd better not, thar's bin a
                    good many cars missed around here lately." I sed, wall now, I want to know, is
                    thar anything round here any fresher than you be? He sed, "yes, sir, that bench
                    you're a sotten on is a little fresher; they painted it about ten minnits ago."
                    Wall, I got up and looked, and durned if he wasn't right.</p>

                <p>ONE day in New York, I thot I'd rite a letter home. Wall after I'd got it all
                    writ, I sed to the landlord of the tavern&mdash;now, whar abouts in New York
                    do you keep the post offis? And he sed, "what do you want with the post offis?"
                    So I told him I'd jist writ a letter home to mother and Samantha Ann, and I'd
                    like to go to the post offis and mail it. And he told me "you don't have to go
                    to the post offis, do you see that little box on the post thar on the corner?" I
                    alowed as how I did. Wall he says, "You jist go out thar and put your letter in
                    that box, and it will go right to the post offis." I sed&mdash;wall now, gee
                    whiz, ain't that handy. Wall I went out thar, and I had a good deal of trouble
                    in gittin' the box open, and when I did git it open, thar wan't any place to put
                    my letter, thar wuz a lot of nobs and hooks <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0053" n="40"/> and hinges, and a lot
                    of readin,' it sed&mdash;"pull on the hook twice and turn the knob," or
                    somethin, like that, I couldn't jist rightly make it out. Wall I yanked on that
                    hook 'till I tho't I'd pull it out by the roots, but I couldn't git the durned
                    thing open, then I turned on the knob two or three times, and that didn't do any
                    good, so I pulled on the hook and turned on the knob at the same time, and jist
                    then I think all the fire bells in New York commenced to ringin' all to onct.
                    Wall I looked round to see whar the fire wuz, and a lot of fire ingines and hook
                    and ladder wagons cum a gallopin' up to whar I stood, and they had a big sody
                    water bottle on wheels, and it busted and squirted sody water all over me. Wall
                    one of them fire fellers, lookin' jist like I'd seen them in picters in Ezra
                    Hoskin's insurance papers, he cum up to me madder'n a hornet, and he sed "what
                    are you tryin' to do with that box?" So I told him I'd jist writ a letter home,
                    and I wuz a tryin' to mail it. He sed "why you durned old green horn, you've
                    called out the hull fire department of New York City." Wall I guess you could
                    have knocked me down with a feather. I sed&mdash;wall you'r a purty healthy
                    lookin' lot of <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0054" n="41"/> fellers, it won't hurt ye any to go back, will it?
                    Wall he sed, "thars your letter box over on thother corner, now you let this box
                    alone." Wall they all drove away, and I went over to the other box, but I didn't
                    know whether to touch it or not, I didn't know but maybe I'd call out the state
                    legislater if I opened it. Wall while I wuz a standin' thar a feller cum along
                    and looked all round, and when he thot thar wan't any body watchin' him, he
                    opened that box and commenced takin' the letters out. Wall I'd heered a whole
                    lot 'bout them post offis robbers, when I wuz post master down home at Punkin
                    Center, so jist arrested him right thar, I took him by the nap of the neck and
                    flopped him right down on the side walk, and sot on him, I
                        hollered&mdash;<hi rend="italic">murder! perlees!</hi> and every other
                    thing I could think of, and a lot of constables and town marshalls cum a runnin'
                    up, and one of them sed "what are you holdin' this man fer?" and I told him I'd
                    caught him right in the act of robbin' the United States Post Offis, and by gosh
                    I arrested him. Wall they all commenced a laffin', and I found out I'd arrested
                    one of the post masters of New York City.</p>

                <p>I'D seen a good many funny things in New York at one time and another, so the
                    last day I wuz thar, I wuz a packin' up my traps, a gittin' ready to go home,
                    when I jist conclooded I'd go out and buy somethin' to remember New York by.</p>

                <p>Wall I wuz a walkin' along down the street when I cum to a place whar they wuz
                    auckshuneerin' off a lot of things. I stopped to see what they had to sell. Wall
                    that place wuz jist chuck full of old-fashioned cooriositys. I saw an old book
                    thar, they sed it wuz five hundred years old, and it belonged at one time to
                    Loois the Seventeenth or Eighteenth, or some of them old rascals; durned if I
                    believe anybody could read it.</p>

                <p>Wall I commenced a biddin' on different things, but it jist looked as though
                    everybody had more money than I did, and they sort of out-bid me; but finally
                    they put up <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0057" n="44"/> an old-fashioned shugar bowl fer sale, and I wanted to
                    git that mighty bad, cos I thought as how mother would like it fust rate. Wall I
                    commenced a biddin' on it, and it wuz knocked down to me fer three dollars and
                    fifty cents. I put my hand in my pockit to git my pockit book to pay fer it, and
                    by gosh it was gone. So I went up to the feller what wuz a sellin' the things,
                    and I sed&mdash;now look here mister, will you jist wait a minnit with your
                    "goin' at thirty make it thirty-five, once, twice, three times a goin' ", and he
                    sed "wall now what's the matter with you?" And I sed, there's matter enuff, by
                    gosh; when I cum in here I had a pockit book in my pockit, had fifty dollars in
                    it, and I lost it somewhars round here; I wish you'd say to the feller what
                    found it that I'll give five dollars fer it; another feller sed "make it ten,"
                    another sed "give you twenty," and another sed "go you twenty-five."</p>

                <p>Durned if I know which one of 'em got it; when I left they wuz still a biddin' on
                    it.</p>

                <p>I WUZ always sort of fond of ridin', so I guess while I wuz down in New York I
                    rode on about everything they've got to ride on thar. I wuz on hoss cars and hot
                    air cars, and them sky light elevated roads. Wall, I had jist about cum to the
                    conclushun that every street in New York had a different kind of a street car on
                    it, but I found one that didn't have care of any kind, I think they call it
                    Avenoo Five. Wall, I wuz a standin' thar one day a watchin' the people and
                    things go by, when all to onct along cum the durndest lookin' contraption I
                    calculate I ever seen in my life. It wuz a sort of a wagon, kind of a cross
                    between a band wagon and a hay rack, and it had a pair of stairs what commenced
                    at the hind end and rambled around all over the wagon. I sed to a gentleman
                    standin' thar: "Mr. in the name of all that's good and bad, what do you call <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0059"
                        n="46"/> that thing?" He sed: "Wall, sir, that's a Fifth Avenoo 'bus." I
                    sed: "Wall, now, I want to know, kin I ride on it?" And he sed: "You kin if
                    you've got a nickel." Wall, I got in and sot down, and I jist about busted my
                    buttins a laffin' at things what happened in that 'bus. Thar wuz a young 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0060" n="47"/> lady cum in and sot down, and she had a little valise in her hand,
                    'bout a foot squar. Wall, she opened the valise and took out a purse and shet
                    the valise, then she opened the purse and took out a dime, and shet the purse,
                    opened the valise and put in the purse, and shet the valise, then she handed the
                    dime to a feller sottin' out on the front of the 'bus, and he give her a nickel
                    back. Then she opened the valise and took out the purse, shet the valise and
                    opened the purse and put in the nickel and shet the purse, opened the valise and
                    put in the purse and shet the valise, then sed, "Stop the bus, please." Wall, I
                    had to snicker right out, though I done my best not to, but I jist couldn't help
                    it. I didn't have any small change so I handed the feller a five-dollar bill.
                    Wall, that feller jist sot and looked at it fer a spell, then he sed "whoa!"
                    stopped the hosses, cum round to the hind end of the 'bus and he sed: "Who give
                    me that five-dollar bill?" I sed: "I did, and it was a good one, too." He sed:
                    "Wall, you cum out here, I want to see you." Wall, I didn't know what he wanted,
                    but I jist made up my mind if he indulged in any foolishness with me I'd flop
                    him in about a <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0061" n="48"/> minnit. Wall, I got out thar, and he sed: "Now look
                    here, honest injun, did you give me that five-dollar bill?" I sed: "Yes, sir,
                    that's jist what I done," and he sed, "Wall, now, which one of the hosses do you
                    want?" Gosh, I don't believe I'd gin him five dollars fer the whole durned

                    and he sed "I guess you mean a department store, don't you?" I sed, wall I don't

                    to git is some muzlin and some caliker. Wall he showed me which way to go, and I
                    started out, and wuz walkin' along down the street lookin' at things, when some
                    feller throwed a bananer peelin' on the sidewalk. Wall now I don't think much of
                    a man what throws a bananer peelin' on the sidewalk, and I don't think much of a
                    bananer what throws a man on the sidewalk, neether. Wall, by chowder, my foot
                    hit that bananer peelin' and I went up in the air, and cum down ker-plunk, and
                    fer about <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0063" n="50"/>
                    a minnit I seen all the stars what stronomy tells about, and some that
                    haint been discovered yit. Wall jist as I wuz pickin' myself up a little boy cum
                    runnin' cross the street and he sed "Oh mister, won't you please do that agin,
                    my mother didn't see you do it." Wall I wish I could a got my hands on that <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0064"
                        n="51"/> little rascal fer about a minnit, and his mother would a seen me do
                    it.</p>

                <p>I found one of them stores finally, and I got on the inside and told a feller
                    what I wanted, and he sent me over to a red-headed girl, and she sent me over to
                    a bald-headed feller; she sed he didn't have anythin' to do only walk the floor
                    and answer questions. Wall I went up to him and I sed, mister I'm sort of a
                    stranger round here, wish you'd show me round 'til I do a little bargainin'. And
                    he sed "Oh you git out, you've got hay seed in your hair." Wall I jist looked at
                    that bald head of hisn, and I sed, wall now, you haint got any hay seed in <hi
                        rend="italic">your</hi> hair, hav you? Everybody commenced a laffin', and he
                    got purty riled, so he sed, smart like, "jist step this way, please." Wall he
                    showed me round and I bought what I wanted, and when I cum to pay the feller
                    what I had to pay, it didn't look as though I wuz a goin' to git any of my money
                    back. I handed him a ten dollar bill, and he jist took it and put it in a little
                    baskit and hitched it onto a wire, and the durned thing commenced runnin' all
                    over the store. Wall now you can jist bet your boots I lit out right after it; I
                    chased it up one side and down the other, I knocked <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0065" n="52"/> down five or
                    six wimmin clerks, and I upsot five or six bargain counters; I took a wrastle
                    out of that bald-headed feller, and jist then some one commenced to holler <hi
                        rend="italic">"cash"</hi> and I sed yep, that's what I'm after. Wall I
                    chased that durned little baskit round 'til I got up to it, and when I did I was
                    right thar whar I started from. Gee whiz, I never felt more foolish in all my
                    life.</p>

                    <hi rend="bold">Uncle Josh's Comments on the Signs Seen in New York</hi>
                </head>

                <p>I SEEN a good many funny things when I wuz in New York, but I think some of the
                    sines what they've got on some of the bildins' are 'bout as funny as anything I
                    ever seen in my life.</p>

                <p>I wuz walkin' down the street one day and I seen a sine, it sed "Quick Lunch."
                    Wall, I felt a little hungry, so I went into the resturant or bordin' house, or
                    whatever they call it, and they had some sines hangin' on the walls in thar that
                    jist about made me laff all over. I noticed one sine sed "Put your trust in the
                    Lord," and right under it wuz another sine what sed "Try our mince pies." Wall,
                    I tried one of them, and I want to tell you right now, if you eat many of them
                    mince pies you want to put your trust in the Lord.</p>

                <p>Wall, I got out of thar, and I walked along fer quite a spell, and finally I cum
                    to a store what had a lot of red, white and blue, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0067" n="54"/> and yaller and
                    purple lights in the winder. Wall, I stopped to look at it, cos it wuz a purty
                    thing, and they had a sine in that winder that jist tickled me, it sed, "Frog in
                      
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0068" n="55"/> your throat 10C." I wouldn't put one of them critters in my throat
                    fer ten dollars.</p>

                <p>Wall, jist a little further up the street I seen another sine what sed "Boots
                    blacked on the inside." Now, any feller what gits his boots blacked on the
                    inside ain't got much respect fer his socks. I git mine blacked on the outside.
                    Then I cum to a sine what had a lot of 'lectric lights shinin' on it, and I
                    could read it jist as plain as day; so I happened to turn round and when I
                    looked at that sine agin, it wa'nt the same sine at all, and jist then it
                    changed right in front of my very eyes, and I cum to the conclooshun that some
                    feller on the inside wuz a turnin' on it jist to have fun with folks, so I cum
                    away; but I had a mighty good laff or two watchin' other folks git fooled, cos
                    it would turn fust one way and then the t'other, and 'fore you could make up
                    your mind what it wuz, the durned thing wouldn't be that at all.</p>

                <p>A little further up the street I seen a sine what sed, "This is the door." Now,
                    any durned fool could see it wuz a door. And then I seen another sine what sed
                    "Walk in." Wall, now, I wunder how in thunder they thought a feller wuz a goin'
                    to cum in, <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0069" n="56"/> on hoss back, or on a bisickle, or how. And then I seen
                    another sine, it wuz in a winder and had a lot of tools around it, and the sine
                    sed, "Cast iron sinks." Wall, now, any durned fool what don't know that cast
                    iron sinks, ought to have some one feel his head and find out what ails him.</p>

                </head>

                <p>NOW I'll jist bet I had more fun to the squar inch while I wuz in New York, than
                    any old feller what ever broke out of a New England smoke house. I had a little
                    the durnd'st time a ridin' on them street cars what they got thar. Wall I wa'nt
                    a ridin' on 'em near as much as I wuz a runnin' after 'em tryin' to ketch 'em.
                    Gosh, I wuz a runnin' after street cars and fire ingines, and every durned thing
                    with red wheels on it, I calculate I run about a mile and a half after a feller
                    one day to tell him the water what he had in his wagon wuz all leakin' out, and
                    when I caught up to him I found out it wuz a durned old sprinklin' cart.</p>

                <p>Wall I got on one of them street cars one day, and it wuz purty crowded, and thar
                    wa'nt any place fer me to sot down, so I had to hang onto one of them little
                    harness straps along side of the car. So I got holt of a strap and I wuz hangin'
                    on, when the conductor <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0071" n="58"/>
                     sed "old man, you'r goin' to be in the road thar, you'd better move up
                    a little further, wall I moved up a little ways and I stepped on a feller's toe,
                    and gee whiz, he got madder'n a wet hen, he sed, `can't you see whar you'r a
                    steppin'?" I sed, "guess <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0072" n="59"/> I kin, but you brought them feet in here,
                    and I've got to step some whar." Wall every one begin to laff, and the conductor
                    sed, "old man you'r makin' too much trouble, you'll have to move for'ard again,"
                    and I got off 'n the gosh durned old car; I paid him a nickel to ride, but I
                    guess I might as well have walked, I wuz a walkin' purty much all the time I wuz
                    in thar.</p>

                <p>Wall I got onto another car, and I got sot down, and I never laffed so much in
                    all my life. Up in one end of the car thar wuz a little slim lady, and right
                    along side of her wuz a big fleshy lady, and it didn't look as though the little
                    slim lady wuz a gittin' more'n about two cents and a half worth of room, so
                    finally she turned round to the fleshy lady and sed, "they ought to charge by
                    weight on this line," and the big lady sed "Wall if they did they wouldn't stop
                    fer you." Gosh I had to snicker right out loud.</p>

                <p>Thar wuz a little boy a sottin' alongside of the big lady, and three ladys got
                    onto the car all to onct, and thar wa'nt any place fer 'em to sot down, and so
                    the big lady sed&mdash;"little boy, you'd oughter git up and let one of them
                    ladys sot down," and the little boy sed, "you git up and they can all sot down."
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0073" n="60"/> Wall by that time your uncle wuz a laffin' right out.</p>

                <p>Sottin' right alongside of me wuz a lady and she had the purtiest little baby I
                    calculate I'd ever seen in all my born days, I wanted to be sociable with the
                    little feller so I jist sort of waved my hand at him, and sed how-d'e-do baby,
                    and that lady just looked et me scornful like and sed "rubber," wall I wuz never
                    more sot back, I guess you could have knocked me down with a feather, I thought
                    it was a genuine baby, I didn't know the little thing was rubber.</p>

                <p>Wall I noticed up in one end of the car thar wuz a little round masheen, and the
                    conductor had a clothes line tied to it, and every time he got a nickel he'd
                    yank on that clothes line, and fust it sed in and then it sed out, I couldn't
                    tell what all them little ins and outs meant, but I jist cum to the conclusion
                    it showed how much the conductor wuz in and the company wuz out.</p>

                <p>Wall I got to talkin' to that feller on the front end of the car, and he wuz a
                    purty nice sort of a feller, he showed me how every thing worked and told me all
                    about it, wall when I got off I sed&mdash;good bye, mister, hope I'll see
                    you agin some time, and he <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0074" n="61"/> sed, "oh, I'll run acrost you one of
                    these days," I told him by gosh he wouldn't run acrost me if I seen him a
                    comin'.</p>

                <p>I NEVER wuz in a town in my life what had as many cort houses in it as New York
                    has got. It jist seemed to me like every judge in New York had a cort house of
                    his own, and most of them cort houses seemed to be along side of some markit
                    house. Thar wuz the Jefferson Markit Cort, and the Essicks Markit Cort, and
                    several other corts and markits, and markits and corts, I can't remember now.
                    Wall, I used to be Jestice of the Peece down home at Punkin Center, and I wuz a
                    little anxious to see how they handled law and jestice in New York City, so one
                    mornin' I went down to one of them cort houses, and thar wuz more different
                    kinds of people in thar than I ever seen afore. Thar wuz all kinds of
                    nationalitys&mdash;Norweegans, Germans, Sweeds, Hebrews, and Skandynavians,
                    Irish and colored folks, old and young, dirty and clean, good, bad and worse.
                    The Judge, he wuz a sottin' up <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0079" n="66"/>
                     on the bench, and a sayin,: "Ten days; ten dollars; Geery society;
                    foundlin' asylum; case dismissed; bring in the next prisoner," and the Lord only
                    knows what else. Wall, some of the cases they tried in that cort house made me
                    snicker right out loud. They brought in a little Irish feller, and the Judge
                    sed: "Prisoner, what is your name?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0080" n="67"/> And the little Irish feller
                    sed: "Judge, your honor, my name is McGiness, Patrick McGiness." And the Judge
                    sed: "Mr. McGiness, what is your occupation?" And the little Irish feller sed:
                    "Judge, your honor, I am a sailor." The Judge sed: "Mr. McGiness, you don't look
                    to me as though you ever saw a ship in all your life." And the little Irish
                    feller sed: "Wall Judge, your honor, if I never saw a ship in me life, do you
                    think I cum over from Ireland in a wagon?" The Judge sed: "Case dismissed. Bring
                    in the next prisoner."</p>

                <p>Wall, the next prisoner what they brought in had sort of an impediment in his
                    talk, and the way he stuttered jist beat all. The Judge sed: "Prisoner, what is
                    your name?" And the prisoner sed: "Jd-Jd-J-J-Judge, yr-yr-yo-yo-your
                    h-h-h-hon-hon-honor, m-m-m-my-my n-n-na-na-name is-is-is&mdash;." The Judge
                    sed: "Never mind, that will do. Officer, what is this prisoner charged with?"
                    And the officer sed: "Judge, your honor, the way he talks sounds o me like he
                    might be charged with sody water." Gosh, I got to laffin' so I had to git right
                    out of the cort house.</p>

                <p>It sort of made me think of a law soot we <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0081" n="68"/> had down hum when Jim
                    Lawson wuz Jestice of the Peece. You see it wuz like this: One spring Si
                    Pettingill wuz goin' out to Mizoori to be gone 'bout a year, and he'd sold off
                    'bout all his things 'cept one cow, and he didn't want to part with the cow,
                    'cause she wuz a mighty good milker, so he struck a bargin with Lige Willet.
                    Lige wuz to keep the cow, paster and feed her, and generally take keer on her
                    fer the milk she giv. Wall, finally Si cum hum, and he went to Lige's place one
                    day and sed: "Wall, Lige, I've cum over to git my cow." And Lige sed: "Cum after
                    your cow? Wall, if you've got any cow round here I'll be durned if I know it."
                    Si sed: "Wall, Lige, I left my cow with you." And Lige sed: "Wall, that's a year
                    ago, and she's et her head off two or three times since then." So Si sed: "Wall,
                    Lige, you've had her milk fer her keep." And Lige sed: "Milk be durned, she went
                    dry three weeks after you left, and she ain't give any milk since, and near as I
                    can figger it out, seems to me as how I've pestered her and fed her all this
                    time, she's my cow." Si sed: "No, Lige, that wa'nt the bargin." But Lige sed:
                    "Bargin or no bargin, I've got her, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0082" n="69"/> seein' as how posession is
                    'bout nine points in the law, I'm goin' to keep her."</p>

                <p>So they went to law about it, and all Punkin Centre turned out to heer the trial.
                    Wall, after Jim Lawson had heered both sides of the case, he sed: "The Cort is
                    compelled, from the evidence sot forth in this case, to find for the plaintiff,
                    the aforesaid Silas Pettingill, as agin' the defendant, the aforesaid Elijah
                    Willet. We find from the evidence sot forth that the cow critter in question is
                    a valuable critter, and wuth more 'n a year's paster and keep, and, tharfore, it
                    is the verdict of this cort that the aforesaid defendant, Elijah Willet, shall
                    keep the cow two weeks longer, and then she is hisn."</p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0084" n="71"/>

                <p>I'D heerd tell a whole lot at various times 'bout that place what they call Coney
                    Iland, and while I wuz down In New York, I jist made up my mind I wuz a goin' to
                    see it, so one day I got on one of them keers what goes acrost the Brooklyn
                    bridge, and I started out for Coney Iland. Settin' right along side of me in the
                    keer wuz an old lady, and she seemed sort of figity 'bout somethin' or other,
                    and finaly she sed to me "mister, do these cars stop when we git on the other
                    side of the bridge?" I sed, wall now if they don't you'll git the durndest bump
                    you ever got in your life.</p>

                <p>Wall we got on the other side, and I got on one of them tra-la-lu cars what goes
                    down to Coney Iland. I give the car feller a dollar, and he put it in his pockit
                    jist the same as if it belonged to him. Wall, when I wuz gittin' purty near thar
                    I sed, Mister, don't I git any change? He sed, "didn't you see that <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0085" n="72"/>
                    sign on the car?" I sed, no sir. Wall he sez "you better go out and look at it."</p>

                <p>Wall I went out and looked at it, and that settled it. It sed "This car goes to
                    Coney Iland without change." Guess it did; I'll be durned if I got any.</p>

                <p>Wall we got down thar, and I must say of all the pandemonium and hubbub I ever
                    heered in my life, Coney Iland beats it all. Bout the fust thing I seen thar wuz
                    a place what they called "Shoot the Shoots." It looked like a big hoss troff
                    stood on end, one end in a duck pond and tother end up in the air, and they
                    would haul a boat up to the top and all git in and then cum scootin' down the
                    hoss troff into the pond. Wall I alowed that ud be right smart fun, so I got
                    into one of the boats along with a lot of other folks I never seed afore and
                    don't keer if I never see agin. They yanked us up to the top of that troff and
                    then turned us loose, and I jist felt as though the whole earth had run off and
                    left us. We went down that troff lickety split, and a woman what wuz settin'
                    alongside of me, got skeered and grabbed me round the neck; and I sed, you let
                    go of me you brazen female critter. But she jist hung on and hollered to beat
                    thunder, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0086" n="73"/> everybody wuz a yellin' all to onct, and that durned
                    boat wuz a goin' faster'n greased lightnin' and I had one hand on my pockit book
                    and tother on my hat, and we went kerslap dab into that duck pond, and the
                    durned boat upsot and we went into the water, and that durned female critter
                    hung onto me and hollered "save me, I'm jist a drownin'." Wall the water wasn't
                    very deep and I jist started to wade out when along cum another boat and run
                    over us, and under we went ker-souse. Wall I managed to get out to the bank, and
                    that female woman sed I was a base vilian to not rescue a lady from a watery
                    grave. And I jist told her if she had kept her mouth shet she wouldn't hav
                    swallered so much of the pond.</p>

                <p>Wall they had one place what they called the <hi rend="italic">Middle Way
                        Plesumps</hi>, and another place what they called <hi rend="italic">The
                        Streets of Caro</hi>, and they had a lot of shows a goin' on along thar.
                    Wall I went into one of 'em and sot down, and I guess if they hadn't of shet up
                    the show I'd a bin sottin' thar yet. I purty near busted my buttins a laffin'.
                    They had a lot of gals a dancin' some kind of a dance; I don't know what they
                    called it, but it sooted me fust rate. When I got home, the more <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0087" n="74"/> I
                    thought about it the more I made up my mind I'd learn that dance. Wall I went
                    out in the corn field whar none of the neighbors could see me, and I'll be
                    durned if I didn't knock down about four akers of corn, but I never got that
                    dance right. I wuz the talk of the whole community; mother didn't speak to me
                    fer about a week, and Aunt Nancy Smith sed I wuz a burnin' shame and a disgrace
                    to the village, but I notice Nancy has asked me a good many questions about jist
                    how it was, and I wouldn't wonder if we didn't find Nancy out in the cornfield
                    one of these days.</p>

                </head>

                <p>WALL, I sed to mother when I left hum, now mother, when I git down to New York
                    City I'm goin' to see a regular first-class theater. We never had many theater
                    doin's down our way. Wall, thar wuz a theater troop cum to Punkin Centre along
                    last summer, but we couldn't let 'em hav the Opery House to show in 'cause it
                    wuz summer time and the Opery House wuz full of hay, and we couldn't let 'em hav
                    it 'cause we hadn't any place to put the hay. An then about a year and a half
                    ago thar wuz a troop cum along that wuz somethin' about Uncle Tom's home; they
                    left a good many of their things behind 'em when they went away. Ezra Hoskins he
                    got one of the mules, and he tried to hitch it up one day; Doctor says he thinks
                    Ezra will be around in about six weeks. I traded one of the dogs to Ruben
                    Hendricks fer a shot gun; Rube cum over t'other day, borrowed the gun and shot
                    the dog.</p>


                <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0089" n="76"/>

                <p>Wall, I got into one of your theaters here, got sot down and wuz lookin' at it;
                    and it wuz a mighty fine lookin' pictur with a lot of lights shinin' on it, and
                    I wuz enjoyin' it fust rate, when a lot of fellers cum out with horns and
                    fiddles, and they all started in to fiddlin' and tootin', end all to once they
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0090" n="77"/> pulled the theatre up, and thar wuz a lot of folks having a
                    regular family quarrel. I knowed that wasn't any of my business, and I sort of
                    felt uneasy like; but none of the rest of the folks seemed to mind it any, so I
                    calculated I'd see how it cum out, though my hands sort of itched to get hold of
                    one feller, 'cause I could see if he would jest go 'way and tend to his own
                    business thar wouldn't be any quarrel. Wall, jest then a young feller handed me
                    a piece of paper what told all about the theater doin's, and I got to lookin' at
                    that and I noticed on it whar it sed thar wuz five years took place 'tween the
                    fust part and the second part. I knowed durned well I wouldn't have time to wait
                    and see the second part, so I got up and went out. Wall, them theater doin's
                    jest put me in mind of somethin' what happened down hum on the last day of
                    school. You see the school teacher got all the big boys and the big girls, and
                    the boys they read essays and the girls recited poetry. One of the Skinner girls
                    recited a piece that sooted me fust rate. Neer as I kin remember it went
                    somethin' like this:</p>


                <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0091" n="78"/>

                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>How nice to hear the bumble-bee</l>
                    <l>When you go out a fishin',</l>
                    <l>But if you happen to sot down on him,</l>
                    <l>He'll spoil your disposition.</l>
                </lg>

                <p>I liked that; thar wuz somethin' so touchin' about it. Then the school teacher he
                    got all the girls in the 'stronomy class and he dressed them up to represent the
                    different kinds of planits. He had one girl to represent the sun&mdash;she
                    wuz red-headed; and another one to represent the moon, and another one fer Mars,
                    and another one fer Jerupetir, and it looked mighty fine, and everythin' wuz a
                    gettin' along fust rate 'til old Jim Lawson 'lowed he could make an improvement
                    on it; so he went out and got a colord girl, and he wanted to sot her between
                    the sun and the moon and make an eklips. And as usual he busted up the whole
                    doin's.</p>

                </head>

                <p>I USED to hear the summer boarders tell a whole lot about a place here in New
                    York kept by Mr. Delmonico. Thar's bin about ten thousand summer boarders down
                    to Punkin Centre one time and another, and I guess I've carried the bundles and
                    stood the grumblin' from about all of them; and when anyone of 'em would find
                    fault with anythin' I used to ast him whar he boarded at in New York, and they
                    all told me at Mr. Delmonico's; so I'd cum to the conclusion that Mr. Delmonico
                    must hav a right smart purty good sized tavern; and I sed to
                    mother&mdash;now mother, when I git down to New York that's whar I'm goin'
                    to board, at Mr. Delmonico's.</p>

                <p>Wall, I got a feller to show me whar it wuz, and when I got on the inside I don't
                    s'pose I wuz ever more sot back in all my life; guess you could have knocked my
                    eyes off with a club; they stuck out like bumps on a log. Wall sir, they had
                    flowers and birds everywhere, and trees a settin' in wash <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0093" n="80"/> tubs,
                    didn't look to me as though they would stand much of a gale; and about a hundred
                    and fifty patent wind mills runnin' all to onct, and out in the woods somewhar
                    they had a band a-playin'. I couldn't see 'em but I could hear 'em; guess some
                    of 'em wuz a havin' a dance to settle down their dinner; I couldn't tell whether
                    it wuz a society festival or a camp meetin' at feedin' 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0094" n="81"/> time. Wall, one feller cum up to me and commenced talkin' some
                    furrin language I didn't understand, somethin' about bon-sour, mon-sour. I jist
                    made up my mind he wuz one of them bunco fellers, and I wouldn't talk to him.
                    Then another feller cum up right smart like and wanted to know if I'd hav my
                    dinner table de hotel or all over a card, and I told him if it wuz all the same
                    to him he could bring me my dinner on a plate. Wall, he handed me a programme of
                    the dinner and I et about half way down it and drank a bottle of cider pop what
                    he give me, and it got into my head, and I never felt so durn good in all my
                    life. I got to singin' and I danced Old Dan Tucker right thar in the dinin'

                    enjoyin' myself right good, they called in alot of constables, and it cost me
                    sixteen dollars and forty-five cents, and then they took me out ridin' in a
                    little blue wagon with a bell on it, and they kept ringin' the bell every foot
                    of the way to let folks know I wuz one of Mr. Delmonico's boarders.</p>

                <p>WALL, one day jist shortly after sap season wuz over, we wuz all sottin' round
                    Ezra Hoskins's store, talkin' on things in general, when up drove Si Pettingill
                    with a load of brooms. Wall, we all took a long breath, and got ready to see
                    some as tall bargainin' as wuz ever done in Punkin Centre. 'Cause Si, he could
                    see a bargain through a six-inch plank on a dark night, and Ezra could hear a
                    dollar bill rattle in a bag of feathers a mile off, and we all felt mighty
                    sartin suthin' wuz a goin' to happen. Wall, Si, he sort er stood 'round, didn't
                    say much, and Ezra got most uncommonly busy&mdash;he had more business than
                    a town marshal on circus day.</p>

                <p>Wall, after he had sold Aunt Nancy Smith three yards of caliker, and Ruben
                    Hendricks a jack-knife, and swapped Jim Lawson a plug of tobacker fer a muskrat
                    hide, he sed: "How's things over your way, Si?" Si remarked: "Things wuz <pb

                    Fork had busted loose and overflowed everything, Sprosby's mill wuz washed out,
                    and Lige Willits's paster wuz all under water, which made it purty hard on the
                    cows, and Lige had to strain the milk two or three times to git the minnews out
                    of it. Whitaker's young 'uns wuz all havin' measles to onct, and thar wuz a
                    revival goin' on at the Red Top Baptist church, and most every one had got
                    religion, and things wuz a runnin' 'long 'bout as usual."</p>

                <p>Deacon Witherspoon sed: "Did you git religion, Si?" Si sed: "No, Deacon; I got
                    baptized, but it didn't take&mdash;calculated I might as well have it done
                    while thar wuz plenty of water."</p>

                <p>"Thought I'd cum over today, Ezra; I've got some brooms I'd like to sell ye."
                    Ezra sed: "Bring 'em in, Si, spring house cleanin' is comin' on and I'll most
                    likely need right smart of brooms, so jist bring 'em in." Si sed: "Wall, Ezra,
                    don't see as thar's any need to crowd the mourners, can't we dicker on it a
                    little bit; I want cash fer these brooms, Ezra, I don't want any store trade fer
                    'em." Ezra sed: "Wall, I don't <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0102" n="89"/> know 'bout that, Si; seems to me
                    that's a gray hoss of another color, I always gin ye store trade fer your eggs,
                    don't I?" Si sed: "Y-a-s&mdash;, and that's a gray hoss of another color; ye
                    never seen a hen lay brooms, did ye? Brooms is sort of article of commerce,
                    Ezra, and I want cash fer 'em." Wall, Ezra, he looked 'round the store and thot
                    fer a spell, and then he sed: "Tell ye what I'll do, Si; I'll gin ye half cash
                    and the other half trade, how'll that be?" Si sed: "Guess that'll be all right,
                    Ezra. Whar will I put the brooms?" Ezra sed: "Put them in the back end of the
                    store, Si, and stack 'em up good; I hadn't got much room, and I've got a lot of
                    things comin' in from Boston and New York." Wall, after Si had the brooms all
                    in, he sed: "Wall, thar they be, five dozen on 'em." Ezra sed: "Sure thar's five
                    dozen?" Si sed: "Yas; counted 'em on the wagon, counted 'em off agin, and
                    counted 'em when I made 'em." So Ezra sed: "Wall, here's your money; now what do
                    you want in trade?" Si looked 'round fer a spell and sed: "I don't know, Ezra;
                    don't see anything any of our folks pertickerly stand in need on. If it's all
                    the same to you, Ezra, I'll take <hi rend="italic">brooms</hi>."</p>

                </head>

                <p>WALL, about two weeks ago the boys sed to me, Uncle we'd like to hav you cum out
                    and play a game of golf. Wall, they took me out behind the woodshed whar mother
                    couldn't see us and them durned boys dressed your uncle up in the dogondest suit
                    of clothes I ever had on in my life. I had on a pair of socks that had more
                    different colors in 'em than in Joseph's coat. I looked like a cross atween a
                    monkey and a cirkus rider, and a-goin' acrost the medder our turkey gobbler took
                    after me and I had an awful time with that fool bird. I calculate as how I'll
                    git even with him 'bout Thanksgiving time.</p>

                <p>Wall, the boys took me into the paster, and they had it all dug up into what they
                    called a "T," and they had a wheelbarrer full of little Injun war clubs. They
                    called one a nibbler, and another a brassie, and a lot of other fool names I
                    never heerd afore, <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0105" n="92"/> and can't remember now. Then they brought out a
                    little wooden ball 'bout as big as a hen's egg, and they stuck it up on a little
                    hunk of mud. Then they told me to take one of them thar war clubs and stand
                    alongside of the ball and hit it. Wall, I jist peeled off my coat and got a good
                    holt on that war club and I jist whaled away at that durned little ball, and by
                    gum I missed it, and the boys all commenced to holler "foozle."</p>

                <p>Wall, I got a little bit riled and I whaled away at it again, and I hit it right
                    whar I missed it the fust time, and I whirled round and sot down so durned hard
                    I sot four back teeth to akin, and I pawed round in the air and knocked a lot of
                    it out of place. I hit myself on the shin and on the pet corn at the same time,
                    and them durned boys wuz jist a-rollin' round on the ground and a-hollerin' like
                    Injuns. Wall, I begun to git madder 'n a wet hen, and I 'lowed I'd knock that
                    durned little ball way over into the next county. So I rolled up my sleeves and
                    spit on my hands and got a good holt on that war club and I whaled away at that
                    little ball agin, and by chowder I hit it. I knocked it clar over into Deacon
                    Witherspoon's paster, <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0106" n="93"/> and hit his old muley cow, and she got
                    skeered and run away, jumped the fence and went down the road, and the durned
                    fool never stopped a-runnin' 'til she went slap dab into Ezra Hoskins' grocery
                    store, upsot four gallons of apple butter into a keg of soft soap, and sot one
                    foot into a tub of mackral, and t'other foot into a box of winder glass, and
                    knocked over Jim Lawson who wuz sottin' on a cracker barrel, and broke his
                    durned old wooden leg, and then she went right out through the winder and
                    skeered Si Pettingill's hosses that wuz a standin' thar, and they run away and
                    smashed his wagon into kindlin' wood' and Silas has sued me fer damages, and
                    mother won't speak to me, and Jim he wants me to buy him a new wooden leg, and
                    the neighbors all say as how I ought to be put away some place fer safe keepin',
                    and Aunt Nancy Smith got so excited she lost her glass eye and didn't find it
                    for three or four days, and when she did git it the boys wuz a-playin' marbles
                    with it and it wuz all full of gaps, and Jim Lawson he trimmed it up on the
                    grindstane and it don't fit Nancy any more, and she has to sort of put it in
                    with cotton round it to bold it, and the cotton works <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0107" n="94"/> out at the
                    corners and skeers the children and every time I see Nancy that durned eye seems
                    to look at me sort of reproachful like, and all I know about playin' golf is,
                    the feller what knocks the ball so durned far you can't find it or whar it does
                    the most damage, wins the game.</p>

                    Centre that had quite so much trouble as Jim Lawson. One fall Jim had a right
                    likely bunch of shoats, but somehow or other he couldn't git 'em fat, it jist
                    seemed like the more he fed 'em the poorer they got, and Jim he wuz jist about
                    worried clar down to a shadder. He kept givin' them hogs medecin' and feedin' of
                    'em everything he could think on, but it wan't no use; every day or so one of
                    'em would lay down and die. All the neighbors would cum and lean over the fence,
                    and talk to Jim, and give him advice, but somehow them hogs jist kept on
                    a-dyin', and nobody could see what wuz alin' of 'em, 'til one day Jim cum over
                    to Ezra Hoskins's store, and he looked as tickled as though he'd found a dollar,
                    and he sed: "I want you all to cum over to my place; I've found out what's alin'

                    Jim sed: "Wall, you see the ground over in my hog lot is purty soft, and when it
                    rains it gits right smart muddy, and the mud gits on them hogs' tails, and that
                    mud it gits more mud, and finally they git so much mud on their tails that it
                    draws their skin so tight that they can't shet their eyes, and them hogs air
                    jist a-dyin' fer the want of sleep."</p>

                <p>Wall, the followin' winter Jim had his hogs all fat and ready fer markit, and he
                    jist conclooded he'd drive 'em to Concord. Wall, he started out, and when he'd
                    druv 'em two whole days he met old Jabez Whitaker. Jabe sed: "Whar you goin'
                    with your hogs, Jim?" Jim sed: "Goin' to Concord, Jabez." Jabez sed "Wall, now,
                    I want to know. That's what cums from not readin' the papers. Why, Jim, they've
                    got more hogs up Concord way than they know what to do with. Lige Willit took
                    his hogs up thar, and Eben Sprosby took his'n, and Concord's jist chuck full of
                    hogs, and so consequintly the markit's away down in Concord. But the paper sez
                    it's good in Manchester, and you'd make money, Jim, by goin' thar." So Jim
                    shifted his <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0110" n="97"/> chew of terbacker over to the northeast, and sed:
                    "Wall, boys, I calculate we'll hav to go to Manchester, so jist head the hogs
                    off and turn them round." Wall, they druv them hogs 'bout three days towards
                    Manchester, and jist 'bout when they wuz gittin' thar, along cum Caleb Skinner,
                    and he sed: "Wall, thunder and fish-hooks, whar be you a-goin', Jim." And Jim
                    sed: "As near as he could figure it out from his present bearin's, he wuz most
                    likely goin' to Manchester." And Caleb sed: "What fer?" Jim sed: "Didn't know
                    exactly what all he wuz goin' fer, but if he ever got thar, he'd most likely
                    sell his hogs." And Caleb sed: "Wall, your goin' to the wrong town. Manchester
                    has got a quarantine agin' any more hogs comin' in, 'cos what hogs they is thar
                    has all got colery, and you'd better go to Concord. Besides the paper says
                    markit is purty well up in Concord." Wall, Jim sed a good many things that
                    wouldn't sound good at a prayer meetin', and then he sed: "Wall, boys, gess
                    we'll start back fer Concord, so turn round." Wall, they went along 'bout two
                    days, and them poor hogs couldn't stand it no longer 'cos they wuz jist clean
                    tuckered out, so Jim had to sell <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0111" n="98"/> 'em to Josiah Martin fer what he
                    could git, 'cos it wuz jist right at Josiah's place whar the hogs gin out, and
                    thar wan't no way of moovin' them from thar fer some time to cum.</p>

                <p>Wall, along 'bout two weeks after that we wuz all over to Ezra Hoskins's store,
                    and some one sed: "Jim, you didn't do very well with your hogs this year, did
                    you?" And Jim sed: "Oh, I don't know; that's jist owin' to how you look at it. I
                    never caught up to that blamed markit, but I had the society of the hogs fer two
                    weeks."</p>

                <p>WALL I s'pose I git buncode offener than any feller what ever lived in Punkin
                    Centre. A short time ago we wanted to build a new town hall, and calculated we'd
                    have a brick building; and some one sed, "Wall now, if you'll jist wait 'til
                    Josh Weathersby makes another trip or two down to New York thar'll be gold
                    bricks enuff a-layin' 'round Punkin Centre to build a new town hall."</p>

                <p>Wall, one day last summer I wuz a sottin' out on my back porch, when along cum
                    one of them thar lightning rod agents. Wall, he jist cum right up and commenced
                    a-talkin' at me jist as if he'd bin the town marshal or a tax assessor, or like
                    he'd known me all his life. He sed, "My dear sir, I am astonished at you. I've
                    looked over your entire premises and I find you haven't got a lightning rod on
                    any buildin' that you possess. Why, my dear sir, don't you know you are <pb

                    lightning may strike at any time and demolish everything within the sound of my
                    voice? Don't you know you are criminally negligent? Why, my dear sir, I am
                    astonished to think that a man of your jedgment and good common sense should
                    allow yourself to&mdash;" Wall, about that time I'd got my breath and wits
                    at the same time, and I sed, "Now hold on, gosh durn ye, what hav ye got to sell
                    anyhow?" Wall, he told me he had some lightnin' rods, and he brought out a
                    little masheen and told me to take hold of the handles and he'd show me what a
                    powerful thing 'lectricity wuz. Wall, I took hold of them handles and he turned
                    on a crank, and that durned masheen jist made me dance all over the porch, and
                    it wouldn't let go. Gee whiz, I felt as though I'd fell in a yaller jacket's
                    nest, and about four thousand of 'em wuz a stingin' me all to onct. Wall, I told
                    him I guessed he could put up a lightning rod or two, seein' as how I didn't hav
                    any. Wall, he went to work and I went over to Ezra Hoskins', and when I got back
                    home my place wuz a sight to behold; it looked like a harrer turned upside down.
                    Thar wuz seven <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0114" n="101"/>
                     lightning rods on the barn, one on the hen house, one on the corn
                    crib, one on the smoke house, two on the granery, three on the kitchen, six on
                    my house, and one on the crab apple tree, and when I got thar that durned fool
                    had the old muley cow cornered up a-tryin' to put a lightnin' rod on her. Wall,
                    I paid him fer what he had done, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0115" n="102"/> thanked the Lord he hadn't
                    done any more. Wall, he got me to sine a paper what sed he had done a good job,
                    and he sed he had to show that to the company.</p>

                <p>Wall, about a week after that we had a thunder storm, and I think the lightnin'
                    struck everything on the place except the spring wagon and old muley cow, and
                    they didn't have any lightnin' rod on 'em. Wall I thought I wuz a-gittin' off
                    mighty lucky til next day, when along cum a feller with that paper what I had
                    sined, and durned if it wan't a note fer six hundred dollars, and by gosh if I
                    didn't hav to pay it!</p>

                </head>

                <p>WALL, sometimes a lot of us old codgers used to git down to Ezra Hoskins'
                    grossery store and we'd sot 'round and chaw terbacker and whittle sticks and eat
                    crackers and cheese and proons and anything Ezra happened to have layin' 'round
                    loos, and then we'd git to spinnin' yarns that would jist about put Annanias and
                    Safiry right out of business if they wuz here now. Wall, one afternoon we wuz
                    all settin' 'round spinnin' yarns when Deacon Witherspoon sed that eckos wuz
                    mighty peculiar things, cos down whar he wuz born and raised thar wuz a passell
                    of hills cum together and you couldn't git out thar and talk louder 'n a whisper
                    on account of the ecko. But one day a summer boarder what wuz thar remarked as
                    how he wasn't afraid to talk right out in meetin' in front of any old lot of
                    hills what wuz ever created; so he went out and hollered jist as loud as he <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0117"
                        n="104"/> could holler, and he started a ecko a-goin' and it flew up agin
                    one hill and bounced off onto another one and gittin' bigger and louder all the
                    time 'til it got back whar it started from and hit a stone quarry and knocked
                    off a piece of stone and hit that feller in the head, and he didn't cum too fer
                    over three hours. Wall, we thought that wuz purty good fer a Deacon. Wall, none
                    of us sed anything fer a right smart spell and then Si Pettingill remarked "he
                    didn't know anything about eckos, but he calculated he'd seen some mighty
                    peculiar things; sed he guessed he'd seen it rain 'bout as hard as anybody ever
                    seen it rain." Someone sed, "Wall, Si, how hard did you ever see it rain?" and
                    he sed, "Wall one day last summer down our way it got to rainin' and it rained
                    so hard that the drops jist rubbed together comin' down, which made them so
                    allfired hot that they turned into steam; why, it rained so gosh dinged hard,
                    thar wuz a cider bar'l layin' out in the yard that had both heads out'n it and
                    the bung hole up; wall, it rained so hard into that bung hole that the water
                    couldn't run out of both ends of the bar'l fast enough, and it swelled up and
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0118" n="105"/> busted." Wall, we all took a fresh chew of terbacker and
                    nudged each other; and Ezra Hoskins sed he didn't remember as how he'd ever seen
                    it rain quite so hard as that, but he'd seen some mighty dry weather; he sed one
                    time when he wuz out in Kansas it got so tarnation dry that fish a-swimmin' up
                    the river left a cloud of dust behind them. And hot, too; why, it got so
                    allfired hot that one day he tied his mule to a pen of popcorn out behind the
                    barn, and it got so hot that the corn got to poppin' and flyin' 'round that old
                    mule's ears and he thought it wuz snow and laid down and froze to death. Wall,
                    about that time old Jim Lawson commenced to show signs of uneasiness, and
                    someone sed, "What is it, Jim?" and Jim remarked, as he shifted his terbacker
                    and cut a sliver off from his wooden leg, "I wuz a-thinkin' about a cold spell
                    we had one winter when we wuz a-livin' down Nantucket way. It wuz hog killin'
                    time, if I remember right; anyhow, we had a kittle of bilin' water sottin' on
                    the fire, and we sot it out doors to cool off a little, and that water froze so
                    durned quick that the ice wuz hot."</p>

                <p>SPEAKIN' of hoss tradin', now Jim Lawson was calculated to be about the best hoss
                    trader in Punkin Centre. Yes, Jim he could sot up on a fence, chew terbacker,
                    whittle a stick, and jist about swap ye outen your eye-teeth, if you'd listen to
                    him.</p>

                <p>Yas, Jim wuz some punkins on a swap; Jim 'd swap anything he had fer anything he
                    didn't want, jist to be swappin'.</p>

                <p>Wall, a gypsy cum along one day and tackled Jim fer a swap; and about that time
                    Jim he'd got hold of a critter that had more cussedness in him to the squar inch
                    than any critter we'd ever sot eyes on, 'cept a cirkus mule that Ezra Hoskins
                    owned.</p>

                <p>Wall, the gypsy traded Jim a mighty fine lookin' critter, and we all calculated
                    that Jim had right smart of a bargain, 'til one day Jim went to ride him, 'n he
                    found out if he tetched the peskey critter on the sides he'd squat right down.
                    Wall, Jim knowed if he didn't git rid of that hoss, his reputation as a <pb

                        n="108"/> hoss trader wuz forever gone; so he went over in t'other township
                    to see old Deacon Witherspoon. You see the Deacon he wuz mighty fond of goin'
                    a-huntin', and as he had rheumatiz purty bad it wuz sort of hard fer him to git
                    'round, so he had to do his huntin' on hoss back. Wall, Jim didn't say much to
                    fust, just kinder hinted around that huntin' was a-goin' to be mighty good this
                    fall, cos he'd seen one or two flocks of partridges over back of Sprosby's
                    medder, and some right smart of quail over by Buttermilk ford, and finally he
                    sed: "Deacon, I've got a hoss you ought to hev; he's a setter." Wall, you could
                    hav knocked the Deacon's eyes off with a club, they stuck out like bumps on a
                    log, and he sed, "Why, Jim, I never heered tell of sech a thing in all my life;
                    the idea of a horse being a setter!" Jim sed, "Yes, Deacon, he's bin trained to
                    set for all kinds of game. I calculated as how I'd git a shotgun this fall and
                    do right smart of hunting." So the Deacon sed, "Wall, now, I want to know; bring
                    him over, Jim, I'd like to see him."</p>

                <p>Wall, Jim took the hoss over, and all Punkin Centre jest sort of held its breath
                    to see how it would cum out.</p>

                <p>Jim and the Deacon went a-hunting, and as they wuz a-ridin' along through the
                    timber down by Ruben Hendrick's paster, Jim keepin' his eyes peeled and not
                    sayin' much, when all to onct he seen a rabbit settin' in a brush heap, and he
                    jist tetched the old hoss on the sides and he squatted right down. The Deacon
                    sed, "Why, what's the matter of your hoss, Jim, look what he be a doin'." Jim
                    sed, "'Sh, Deacon, don't you see that rabbit over thar in the brush heap? the
                    old hoss is a-settin' of him." Deacon sed, "Wall, now that's the most remarkable
                    thing I ever seen in my life; how'd you like to trade, Jim?" Jim sed, "Wall,
                    Deacon, I hadn't calculated on disposin' of the hoss, but I ain't much of a hand
                    at huntin', and seein' as how it's you, if you want him I'll trade you, Deacon,
                    fifty dollars to boot."</p>

                <p>Wall, the Deacon had a mighty fine animal, but he sed, "I'll trade you, Jim."
                    They traded hosses, and when they wuz a-comin' home they had to ford the crick
                    what runs back of Punkin Centre, and when the old hoss wuz a-wadin' through the
                    water, Deacon went to pull his feet up to keep them from gettin' wet, and he
                    tetched the old boss on the sides and he squatted right <pb

                </head>

                <p>WE had bin havin' a good deal of argufyin' about the school house. You see it had
                    got to be a sort of a tumble-down ramshackle sort of an affair, and when it wuz
                    bad weather we couldn't have school in it, 'cause you might jist as well be a
                    sittin' under a siv when it rained as to be a settin' in that school house.
                    Wall, it wuz a-cummin' along the fall term, and we wanted our boys and girls to
                    git all the schoolin' an' eddication what they could; so we called a meetin' of
                    the school directors to devise ways and means of buildin' a new school-house
                    without stoppin' school. Wall, we all met down at the school-house; thar wuz
                    Deacon Witherspoon, Ezra Hoskins, Ruben Hendricks, Si Pettingill, old Jim Lawson
                    and me. Before we commenced debatin' and argufyin' on the matter, Si Pettingill
                    alowed he'd sing a song. Wall, he got up and sang the durndest old-fashioned <pb

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0126" n="113"/> song I calculate I ever heered in my life; went somethin' like
                    this:</p>

                <lg type="verse">

                    <l>Oh a frog went a courtin' and he did ride,</l>
                    <l>oohoo&mdash;oohoo.</l>
                    <lb/>
                    <l>Oh a frog went a courtin' and he did ride,</l>
                    <l>With a sword and a pistol by his side,</l>
                    <l>oohoo&mdash;oohoo.</l>
                    <lb/>
                    <l>He rode till he came to the mouse's door,</l>
                    <l>oohoo&mdash;oohoo,</l>
                    <lb/>
                    <l>He rode till he came to the mouse's door,</l>
                    <l>And there he knelt upon the floor,</l>
                    <l>oohoo&mdash;oohoo.</l>
                    <lb/>
                    <l>He took Miss Mousey on his knee,</l>
                    <l>oohoo&mdash;oohoo.</l>
                    <lb/>
                    <l>He took Miss Mousey on his knee,</l>
                    <l>Said he, Missy Mouse will you marry me?</l>
                    <l>oohoo&mdash;oohoo.</l>
                </lg>

                <p>Wall, we headed Si off right thar; I guess if we hadn't he'd bin singin' about
                    that frog and the mouse yet. Wall, jist then old Jim Lawson he sed, "I make a
                    moshen;" and Deacon Witherspoon, he wuz chairman, and he sed, "Now look here,
                    young feller, don't you make any moshens at me or durned if I don't git down
                    thar and flop you in about a minnit. You take your feet off'n that desk and that
                    corncob pipe out'n your mouth, and conduct yourself with dignity and decorum,
                    and address the chairman of <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0127" n="114"/> this yere meetin' in a manner
                    befittin' to his station." Wall, Jim he got right smart riled over the matter,
                    and he sed, "Wall, you gosh durned old gospel pirate, I want you to understand
                    that I'm a member of this body, a citizen, a taxpayer and a honorably discharged
                    servant of the government, and I make a moshen that we build a new school-house
                    out of the bricks of the old school-house, and I do further offer an amendment
                    to the original moshen, that we don't tear down the old schoolhouse until the
                    new one is built."</p>

                <p>Wall, Deacon Witherspoon sed, "The gentleman is out of order;" and Jim sed, "I
                    ain't so durned much out of order but that I kin trim you in about two shakes of
                    a dead sheep's tail." Wall, before we knowed it, them two old cusses wuz at it.
                    The Deacon he grabbed Jim and Jim he grabbed the Deacon, and when we got 'em
                    separated the Deacon he wuz stuck fast 'tween a desk and the woodbox, and Jim
                    had his wooden leg through a knot hole in the floor and couldn't get it out, and
                    they've both gone to law about it. Jim says he's goin' to git out a writ of
                    corpus cristy fer the Deacon, and the Deacon says he's goin' to prosecute Jim
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0128" n="115"/> for bigamy and arson and have him read out of the church.</p>

                <p>Wall, we've got the same old schoolhouse.</p>

                <p>WALL, t'other day, down in New York, I wuz a-walkin' along on that street what
                    they call the broad way, when I cum to the Herald squar noospaper buildin', and
                    it wuz all winders and masheenery. Wall, I wuz jist flobgasted; I jist stood
                    thar lookin' at it. On the front thar wuz a bell and a couple of fellers
                    standin' along side of it with slege hammers in their hands, and every onct in a
                    while they would go to poundin' on that bell, and folks 'd stand 'round and
                    watch 'em do it; they reminded me of a couple of fellers splittin' rales. And
                    all 'round the edge of the buildin' they had hoot owls sottin', with electric
                    lites in their ize, and thar wuz no end to the masheenery in that buildin'. If
                    anyone hed ever told me thar wuz that much masheenery in the whole world durned
                    if I'd a-beleeved them; biggest masheen I'd ever seen <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0131" n="118"/> before wuz
                    Si Pettingill's new thrashin' masheen. Wall, I jist stood thar a-watchin' them
                    printin' presses a-runnin'; paper goin' in to one end and cumin' out at t'other
                    all printed and full of picters and folded up ready to sell; it jist beat all
                    the way they done it. Wall, we never had but one paper down home at Punkin
                    Centre; we called it "The Punkin Centre Weakly Bugle;" old Jim Lawson he wuz
                    editor of it. You see Jim he wuz sort of a triflin' no 'count old cuss, so to
                    keep him out of mischief we made him editor. Wall, Jim he had his place up over
                    Ezra Hoskins' grossery store. He never got any money for the
                    noospaper&mdash;always got paid in produce, and Ezra's store wuz a mighty
                    good place fer him to take in his subskriptions. Wall, things went along pretty
                    smooth fer quite a spell 'til one day a feller he cum in and give Jim a keg of
                    hard cider fer a year's subskription to the noospaper, and we all calculated
                    right then that somethin' wuz a-goin' to happen; and sure enough it did. You see
                    'bout that time Jim had got two advertisements; one wuz fer Ruben Jackson's
                    resterant and the other wuz the time table of the Punkin Centre and Paw Paw
                    Valley Railroad. Wall, Jim he got to <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0132" n="119"/> drinkin' the hard cider and
                    settin' type at the same time, and when the paper cum out on Thursday it wuz
                    wuth goin' miles to see. Neer as I kin remember it sed that: "Ruben Jackson's
                    resterant would leave the depo every mornin' at eight o'clock fer beefstake and
                    mutton stews, and would change cars at White River Junkshen for mins and punkin
                    pise, and cottage puddin' would be a flag stashen fer coffy and do nuts like
                    mother used to make, and the train wouldn't run on Sundays cos the stashun agint
                    what done the cookin' would have to run an extra on that day over the chicken
                    and ham sandwitch divishion."</p>

                <p>WALL, we've jist bin havin' a camp meeting at Punkin Centre. Yes, fer several
                    days we wuz purty busy bakin' and cookin and makin' preparations fer the camp
                    meetin', and some of the committee alowed we ought to have lemonade fer the
                    Sunday school children. Wall, as we wanted to git it jist as cheap as possible,
                    we damed up the crick what runs back of the camp meeting grounds, and put in ten
                    pounds of brown sugar and half a dozen lemons, and let the Sunday school
                    children drink right out of the crick, free of charge. Wall, we had right smart
                    difficulty in gittin' a pulpit fixed up fer the ministers, but finally we sawed
                    down a hemlock tree and used the stump fer a pulpit. Wall, some of the sarmons
                    preached at that camp meetin' beat anything I ever heered in my life afore. You
                    see we 'd bin havin' a good many argyments 'bout corporations, monopolies and
                    trusts, and one <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0135" n="122"/> minister got up and sed, "Ah, my dear beloved
                    brethren and sisters, we should not be too severe on the monopolists. If we read
                    the scripters closely we observe our forefathers wuz all monopolists. Adam and
                    Eve had a monopoly upon the garden of Eden, and would have had it 'til this day,
                    no doubt, had not Mother Eve got squeezed in the apple market. Yea, verily,
                    Lot's wife had a corner on the salt market. And while Pharoe's daughter was not
                    in the milk business, yet we observe she took a great proffit out of the water;
                    yea, verrily." Most on us cum to the conclusion he wuz ridin' on a free pass.</p>

                <p>Samantha Hoskins concluded she would have to sing her favorit hymn; it went
                    something like this:</p>

                <lg type="verse">

                    <l>"Oh you need not cum in the mornin',</l>
                    <l>And neither in the heat of the day;</l>
                    <l>But cum along in the evenin', Lord,</l>
                    <l>And wash my sins away.</l>

                    <l>Standin' on the walls of Zion,</l>
                    <l>Lookin' at my ship cum a sailin' over;</l>
                    <l>Standin' on the walls of Zion,</l>
                    <l>To see my ship cum in."</l>
                </lg>

                <p>Jist about that time Ruben Hendricks <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0136" n="123"/> skeered a skunk out of a
                    holler log. Si Pettingill stirred up a hornet's nest, Deacon Witherspoon sot
                    down in a huckleberry pie and Aunt Nancy Smith got a spider on her, and she
                    started in to yellin' and jumpin' like she had a fit, and two dogs got to
                    fitin', and old Jim Lawson he tried to git 'em apart and he stumped 'round and
                    got his old wooden leg into a post hole and fell down, and the dogs got on top
                    of him, and you couldn't tell which wuz Jim nor which wuz dog; and durned if it
                    didn't bust up the camp meetin'.</p>

                    <l>But Jim, the poor old feller,</l>
                    <l>Had one besettin' sin,</l>
                    <l>A fondness fer hard cider</l>
                    <l>Which he'd bin indulgin' in.</l>
                    <lb/>
                    <l>But he sot down at that organ,</l>
                    <l>Planked his feet upon the pedals,</l>
                    <l>And he showed us he could play it</l>
                    <l>Though he hadn't any medals;</l>
                    <l>He dwelt upon the treble</l>
                    <l>And he flirted with the base,</l>
                    <l>He almost made that organ</l>
                    <l>Jump right out of its case.</l>
                    <lb/>
                    <l>Wall, the cider got in old Jim's head</l>
                    <l>And in his fingers, too,</l>
                    <l>So he played some dancin' music</l>
                    <l>And old Yankee Doodle Doo;</l>
                    <l>He shocked old Deacon Witherspoon</l>
                    <l>And scared poor Sister Morgan,</l>
                    <l>And jist busted up the meetin'</l>
                    <l>At the unveilin' of the organ.</l>

                    <hi rend="bold">Uncle Josh Plays a Game of Base Ball</hi>
                </head>

                <p>I HAD heered a whole lot 'bout them games of foot ball they have in New York, so
                    while I was thar I jist cum to the conclusion I'd see a game of it, so went out
                    to one of their city pasters to see a game of foot ball. Wall now I must say I
                    didn't see much ball playin' of any kind. All I got to see wuz about fifty or
                    sixty ambulances, and I think about that many surgons and phisicians. Wall, from
                    what I could see of the game I calculate they needed all of them. I saw one
                    feller and 'bout fifty others had him down, and it jist looked as though they
                    wuz all trying to get a kick at him. They had a half back and a quarter back; I
                    suppose when they got through with that feller he wuz a hump back. Anyhow, if
                    that's what they call foot ball playin', your Uncle Josh don't want any foot
                    ball in his'n.</p>

                <p>I never played but one game of ball in <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0141" n="128"/>
                     my life that I kin remember on, and don't believe that I ever will
                    forgit that. You see it wuz along in the spring time of the yeer, and the
                    weather wuz purty warm and sunshiny, and the boys sed to me, "Uncle, we'd like
                    to have you help us play a game of base ball." I sed, "Boys, I'm gittin' a
                    little too old fer those kinds of passtimes, but I'll help you play one game,
                    I'll be durned if I don't." Wall, we got out in the paster and <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0142" n="129"/> wuz
                    gittin' ready to play; we got the bases and bats put around in thar places, and
                    a buckit of drinkin' water up in the fence corner, whar we could get a drink
                    when we wanted it. We didn't have any bleechers, but we had thirty or forty
                    hogs, and they wuz the best rooters you ever seen; jist then I happened to look
                    around and thar wuz the biggest billy goat I ever saw in all my life. You ought
                    to seen the boys a-gittin' out of the paster; I would hav got out too, but I got
                    stuck in the fence. Wall, you ought to hav seen that billy goat a-gittin' me
                    through the fence. He didn't git me all the way through, cos I wuz half way
                    through when he got thar; but he got the last half through. I didn't make any
                    home run, but I wuz the only feller what had a score of the game; I couldn't see
                    the score, but I had it. Every time I'd go to sot down I knowed jist exactly how
                    the game stood.</p>

                <p>They hav a good many new fangled games now, but when they git anything that can
                    beet a game of base ball with a billy goat fer a battery, durned if I don't want
                    to see it.</p>

                <p>WONDERS will never cease&mdash;we've got a railroad in Punkin Centre now; oh,
                    we're gittin' to be right smart cityfied. I guess that's about the crookedest
                    railroad that ever wuz bilt. I think that railroad runs acrost itself in one or
                    two places; it runs past one station three times. It's so durned crooked they
                    hav to burn crooked wood in the ingine. Wall, the fust ingine they had on the
                    Punkin Centre wuz a wonderful piece of masheenery. It had a five-foot boiler and
                    a seven-foot whissel, and every time they blowed the whissel the durned old
                    ingine would stop.</p>

                <p>Wall, we've got the railroad, and we're mighty proud of it; but we had an awful
                    time a-gittin' it through. You see, most everybody give the right of way 'cept
                    Ezra Hoskins, and he didn't like to see it go through his medder field, and it
                    seemed as <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0145" n="132"/> though they'd hav to go 'round fer quite a ways, and
                    maybe they wouldn't cum to Punkin Centre at all. Wall, one mornin' Ezra saw a
                    lot of fellers down in the medder most uncommonly busy like; so he went down to
                    them and he sed, "Wat be you a-doin' down here?" And they sed, "Wall, Mr.
                    Hoskins, we're surveyin' fer the railroad." And Ezra sed, "So we're goin' to hav
                    a railroad, be we? Is it goin' right through here?" And they sed, "Yes, Mr.
                    Hoskins, that's whar it's a-goin', right through here." Ezra sed, "Wall, I
                    s'pose you'll have a right smart of ploughin' and diggin', and you'll jist about
                    plow up my medder field, won't ye?" They sed, "Yes, Mr. Hoskins, we'll hav to do
                    some gradin'." Ezra sed, "Wall, now, let me see, is it a-goin' jist the way
                    you've got that instrument p'inted?" They sed, "Yes, sir, jist thar." And Ezra
                    sed, "Wall, near as I kin calculate from that, I should jedge it wuz a-goin'
                    right through my barn." They sed, "Yes, Mr. Hoskins, we're sorry, but the
                    railroad is a-goin' right through your barn."</p>

                <p>Wall, Ezra didn't say much fer quite a spell, and we all expected thar would be
                    trouble; but finally he sed, "Wall, I s'pose <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0146" n="133"/> the community of
                    Punkin Centre needs a railroad and I hadn't oughter offer any objections to its
                    goin' through, but I'm goin' to tell ye one thing right now, afore you go any
                    further. When you git it bilt and a-runnin', you've got to git a man to cum down
                    here and take keer on it, cos it's a-cumin' along hayin' and harvestin' time,
                    and I'll be too durned busy to run down here and open and shet them barn doors
                    every time one of your pesky old trains wants to go through."</p>

                <p>A LONG last summer Ruben Hoskins, that is Ezra Hoskins' boy, he cum home from
                    college and bro't one of them new fangled bisickle masheens hum with him, and I
                    think ever since that time the whole town of Punkin Centre has got the bisickle
                    fever. Old Deacon Witherspoon he's bin a-ridin' a bisickle to Sunday school, and
                    Jim Lawson he couldn't ride one of them 'cause he's got a wooden leg; but he
                    jist calculated if he could git it hitched up to the mowin' masheen, he could
                    cut more hay with it than any man in Punkin Centre. Somebody sed Si Pettingill
                    wuz tryin' to pick apples with a bisickle.</p>

                <p>Wall, all our boys and girls are ridin' bisickles now, and nothin' would do but I
                    must learn how to ride one of them. Wall, I didn't think very favorably on it,
                    but in order to keep peace in the family I told them I would learn. Wall, gee
                    whilikee, by gum. I wish you had bin thar when I commenced. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0149" n="136"/> I took
                    that masheen by the horns and I led it out into the middle of the road, and I
                    got on it sort of unconcerned like, and then I got off sort of unconcerned like.
                    Wall, I sot down a minnit to think it over, and then the trouble commenced. I
                    got on that durned masheen and it jumped up in the front and kicked up behind,
                    and bucked up in the middle, and shied and balked and jumped sideways, and
                    carried on worse 'n a couple of steers the fust time they're yoked. Wall, I
                    managed to hang on fer a spell, and then I went up in the air and cum down all
                    over that bisickle. I fell on top of it and under it and on both sides of it; I
                    fell in front of the front wheel and behind the hind wheel at the same time.
                    Durned if I know how I done it but I did. I run my foot through the spokes, and
                    put about a hundred and fifty punctures in a hedge fence, and skeered a hoss and
                    buggy clar off the highway. I done more different kinds of tumblin' than any
                    cirkus performer I ever seen in my life, and I made more revolutions in a
                    fifteen-foot circle than any buzz-saw that ever wuz invented. Wall, I lost the
                    lamp, I lost the clamp, I lost my patience, I lost my temper, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0150" n="137"/> I
                    lost my self-respect, my last suspender button and my standin' in the community.
                    I broke the handle bars, I broke the sprockets, I broke the ten commandments, I
                    broke my New Year's pledge and the law agin loud and abusive language, and Jim
                    Lawson got so excited he run his wooden leg through a knot-hole in the porch and
                    couldn't git it out agin. Wall, I'm through with it; once is enough fer me. You
                    kin all ride your durned old bisickles that want to, but fer my part I'd jist as
                    soon stand up and walk as to sit down and walk. No more bisickles fer your Uncle
                    Josh, not if he knows it, and your Uncle Josh sort of calculates as how he do.</p>

                <p>A LONG about two summers ago we had a baptizin' at the Hickory Corners Church,
                    and before the baptizin' we had preachin', and before the preachin' we had
                    Sunday school. Wall now, some of them questions and answers in that Sunday
                    school jist made me snicker right out loud. You see, old Deacon Witherspoon wuz
                    a-teachin' the Sunday school class, and he sed, "Now let me see what little boy
                    can tell me who slew the Philistines and whar at?" Wall, no one sed anything fer
                    about a minnit, then a little red-headed feller down at the foot of the class
                    sed, "Commodore Dewey, at Manila." The Deacon sed, "No, Henry, it wasn't
                    Commodore Dewey what slew the Philistines, it wuz Sampson." Another little
                    feller sed, "No, Deacon, I think you've sort of got it mixed up; he wasn't
                    there; Schley is the feller what done the job, at Santiague." <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0153" n="140"/> The
                    Deacon sed, "Now, boys, you've bin readin' too much about them war doin's in the
                    papers. Now what little boy can tell me what is the first commandment?" And Ezra
                    Hoskins' boy sed, "Remember the main." Gosh, I had to go right out of the
                    meetin' house, whar I could have a good laugh. Wall, I wouldn't have bin down
                    thar in the fust place, or the second place, fer that matter, if it hadn't bin
                    fer old Jim Lawson. You see, Jim he's a peculiar old critter. He's got one eye
                    out; lost it lookin' fer a pension, I believe. Wall, Jim he cum over to my house
                    and he sed, "Josh, let's you and me go down to the baptizin'." I sed, "What do
                    you want to go down thar fer, Jim; you can't git any pension thar, kin ye?" Jim
                    sed, "Wall, you see, Josh, thar wuz a pedler left some hymn books at my house,
                    and I want to go down thar and see if I can't sell 'em." Wall, we hadn't bin
                    thar more 'n a minnit when Jim he told the minister he had the hymn books to
                    sell, and the minister sed he'd tell the congregation all about it. Then Jim he
                    sot right down in the meetin' house and went to sleep; and then he went to
                    snorin'; you could hear him clar acrost a forty acre lot. I wouldn't <pb

                    /> a-keered a gosh durn, but he woke me up Wall, about the time the minister wuz
                    a-gittin' through with his sarmon, he sed, "Now all members of the congregation
                    having babies here to-day and wantin' of them baptized after the sarmon is over,
                    bring them up to the pulpit and I will baptize them." Wall, Jim he woke up about
                    that time, and be thought the minister wuz a-talkin' about his hymn books; so he
                    stood up and sed, Now all you folks what ain't got any I'll let ye have 'em,
                    twenty-five cents apiece."</p>

                <p>Dedicated to Engineer John Hoolihan, Pittsburg and Lake Erie Railroad, Pittsburg,
                    Pa.</p>

                <lg type="verse">

                    <l>WALL, John, I read your poetry,</l>
                    <l>And laughed till I nearly</l>
                    <l>cried,</l>
                    <l>Seein' how you became an engineer,</l>
                    <l>And got on the right hand</l>
                    <l>side.</l>
                    <l>It made me think of the days gone by,</l>
                    <l>When I wuz one of you fellers, too,</l>
                    <l>What used to run an old machine,</l>
                    <l>And go tootin' the country through.</l>
                    <l>But the engine that I had then, John,</l>
                    <l>Wuz far from a "Nancy Hanks;"</l>
                    <l>She wuz old and worn and loggy,</l>
                    <l>And jist chuck full of pranks;</l>
                    <l>And she wuz wonderfully got up, John,</l>
                    <l>Full of bolts and valves and knobs,</l>
                    <l>And the boiler wouldn't hold water;</l>
                    <l>Gosh, it wouldn't hold cobs.</l>


                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0157" n="144"/>

                    <l>But I wuz younger then, John,</l>
                    <l>And I didn't care a cuss;</l>
                    <l>So I'd pull the throttle open</l>
                    <l>And jist let her wheeze and fuss.</l>
                    <l>The road that I wuz a-runnin' on</l>
                    <l>Wuz out in the woolly west;</l>
                    <l>Two streaks of rust and the right of way</l>
                    <l>Wuz puttin' it at its best.</l>
                    <l>So we sort of plugged along, John.</l>
                    <l>And didn't put on any frills,</l>
                    <l>Never thought of doin' anything</l>
                    <l>But doublin' all the hills.</l>
                    <l>I tell you those were rocky times,</l>
                    <l>And we hadn't no air brake;</l>
                    <l>And fifteen miles an hour, John,</l>
                    <l>Wuz durn good time to make.</l>
                    <lb/>
                    <l>And thar wuz as good a lot of boys</l>
                    <l>As you could meet with anywhere;</l>
                    <l>Rough and ready open up,</l>
                    <l>And always on the square.</l>
                    <l>And I'd like to see them all again,</l>
                    <l>And grasp each honest hand;</l>
                    <l>But some of them, like me, have quit,</l>
                    <l>Some have gone to another land.</l>
                    <l>I have changed somewhat since then, John,</l>
                    <l>Jist a little more steady grown;</l>
                    <l>But I often think of my railroad days</l>
                    <l>As the happiest ones I've known.</l>


                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0158" n="145"/>

                    <l>And, John, I often watch the trains</l>
                    <l>As they go whizzing by;</l>
                    <l>As I think of Bill, or Jim, or Jack,</l>
                    <l>Thar's a tear comes in my eye.</l>
                    <lb/>
                    <l>Perhaps you'd like to know, John,</l>
                    <l>Just why I quit the rail,</l>
                    <l>And as some feller one time sed,</l>
                    <l>"Thereby hangs a tale."</l>
                    <l>I wuz goin' along one night, John,</l>
                    <l>At a purty lively rate,</l>
                    <l>The old machine a-doin' her best,</l>
                    <l>And me forty minutes late,</l>
                    <l>When all at once there came a crash,</l>
                    <l>I felt the old track yield,</l>
                    <l>And fireman, machine and I</l>
                    <l>Went into a farmer's field.</l>
                    <l>There's little more to say, John,</l>
                    <l>They laid me up for repairs,</l>
                    <l>But my fireman, poor fellow,</l>
                    <l>Hadn't time to say his prayers.</l>
                    <lb/>
                    <l>So now you have my story, John;</l>
                    <l>Still, you don't know how it feels</l>
                    <l>To know you've got to plug around</l>
                    <l>On a couple of flat wheels.</l>
                    <l>But it doesn't bother me, John,</l>
                    <l>Gosh, not fer a minnit;</l>


                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0159" n="146"/>

                    <l>I'm as happy as the day is long,</l>
                    <l>And feel jist strictly in it.</l>
                    <l>But sometimes I like to meet the boys,</l>
                    <l>And talk them days all over,</l>
                    <l>And I feel as gay and chipper</l>
                    <l>As a calf in a field of clover</l>
                    <l>But the happiest days I've known, John,</l>
                    <l>The ones that to me see best,</l>
                    <l>Wuz when I run an old machine</l>
                    <l>Way out in the woolly west.</l>

                    <hi rend="bold">Uncle Josh at a Circus</hi>
                </head>

                <p>WALL, 'long last year, 'bout harvest time, thar wuz a cirkus cum to Punkin
                    Centre, and I think the whole population turned out to see it. They cum paradin'
                    into town, the bands a-playin' and banners flying, and animals pokin' their
                    heads out of the cages, and all sorts of jim cracks. Deacon Witherspoon sed they
                    wuz a sinful lot of men and wimmin, and no one aughter go and see them, but
                    seein' as how they wuz thar, he alowed he'd take the children and let them see
                    the lions and tigers and things. Si Pettingill remarked, "Guess the Deacon won't
                    put blinders on himself when he gits thar." We noticed afterwards that the
                    Deacon had a front seat whar he could see and hear purty well.</p>

                <p>Wall, I sed to Ezra Hoskins, "Let's you and me go down to the cirkus," and Ezra
                    sed, "All right, Joshua." So we got on our store clothes, our new boots, and put
                    some money in our pockits, and went down to the <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0161" n="148"/>
                    cirkus. Wall, I never seen any one in my life cut up more fool capers
                    than Ezra did. We got in whar the animals wuz, and Ezra he walked around the
                    elefant three or four times, and then he sed, "By gum, Josh, that's a durned
                    handy critter&mdash;he's got two tails, and he's eatin' with one and keepin'
                    the flies off with t'other." Durned old fool! <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0162" n="149"/> Wall, we went on a
                    little ways further, and all to onct Ezra he sed, "Geewhiz, Josh, thar's Steve
                    Jenkins over thar in one of them cages." I sed, "Cum along you silly fool, that
                    ain't Steve Jenkins." Ezra sed, "Wall, now, guess I'd oughter know Steve Jenkins
                    when I see him; I jist about purty near raised Steve." Wall, we went over to the
                    cage, and it wan't no man at all, nuthin' only a durned old baboon; and Ezra
                    wanted to shake hands with him jist 'cause he looked like Steve. Ezra sed he'd
                    bet a peck of pippins that baboon belonged to Steve's family a long ways back.</p>

                <p>Wall then we went into whar they wuz havin' the cirkus doin's, and I guess us two
                    old codgers jist about busted our buttins a-laffin at that silly old clown.
                    Wall, he cut up a lot of didos, then he went out and sot down right alongside of
                    Aunt Nancy Smith; and Nancy she'd like to had histeericks. She sed, "You go 'way
                    from me you painted critter," and that clown he jist up and yelled to beat
                    thunder&mdash;sed Nancy stuck a pin in him. Wall, everybody laffed, and
                    Nancy she jist sot and giggled right out. Wall, they brought a trick mule into
                    the ring, and the ring master sed he'd give any one five <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0163" n="150"/> dollars
                    what could ride the mule; and Ruben Hoskins alowed he could ride anything with
                    four legs what had hair on. So he got into the ring, and that mule he took after
                    Ruben and chased him 'round that ring so fast Ruben could see himself goin'
                    'round t'other side of the ring. He wuz mighty glad to git out of thar. Then a
                    gal cum out on hoss back and commenced ridin' around. Nancy Smith sed she wuz a
                    brazen critter to cum out thar without clothes enough on her to dust a fiddle.
                    But Deacon Witherspoon sed that wuz the art of 'questrinism; we all alowed it,
                    whatever he meant. And then that silly old clown he told the ring master that
                    his uncle committed sooiside different than any man what ever committed
                    sooiside; and the ring master sed, "Wall, sir, how did your uncle commit
                    sooiside?" and that silly old clown sed, "Why, he put his nose in his ear and
                    blowed his head off." Then he sang an old-fashioned song I hadn't heered in a
                    long time; went something like this:</p>

                <lg type="verse">

                    <l>From Widdletown to Waddletown is fifteen miles,</l>
                    <l>From Waddletown to Widdletown is fifteen miles,</l>
                    <l>From Widdletown to Waddletown, from Waddletown</l>
                    <l>to Widdletown,</l>
                    <l>Take it all together and its fifteen miles.</l>
                </lg>


                <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0164" n="151"/>

                <p>He wuz about the silliest cuss I ever seen. Wall, I noticed a feller a rummagin'
                    'round among the benches as though he might a-lost somethin'. So I sed to him,
                    "Mister, did you lose anythin' 'round here any place?" He sed, "Yes, sir, I lost
                    a ten dollar bill; if you find it I'll give you two dollars." Wall, I jist made
                    up my mind he wuz one of them cirkus sharpers, and when he wan't a-lookin' I
                    pulled a ten dollar bill out of my pockit and give it to him; and the durned
                    fool didn't know but what it wuz the same one that he lost. Gosh, I jist fooled
                    him out of his two dollars slicker 'n a whistle. I tell you cirkus day is a
                    great time in Punkin Centre.</p>

                <p>I DIDN'T s'pose when I wuz gittin' ready to go home, that all you folks would be
                    down here to the depo' to see me off. Wall, now, that's purty good of ye, I'll
                    be durned it it ain't. Yes, I guess I'll have to be goin' home now; I've stayed
                    here this time 'bout as long as I kin afford to. I must say, some of you folks
                    have made it purty warm fer me since I've bin here in New York; but I guess I've
                    enjoyed it 'bout as much as you have.</p>

                <p>I'd like to have you all cum down to Punkin Centre and see <hi rend="italic"
                    >mee</hi> some time this summer, if you hain't got nuthin' else to do. Lots of
                    fun down thar on that farm of mine, huntin', fishin', and shootin', and other
                    things. Wall, I never shot but one bird in my life, and that wuz a squirrel;
                    yes, sir, a flyin' squirrel.</p>

                <p>I had a feller workin' fer me on the farm last summer, and he was cross-eyed, and
                    I <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0167" n="154"/> sent him out in the paster to dig a well fer me, and what do you
                    s'pose? Wall he dug it so tarnal allfired crooked that he fell out of it and
                    sprained his ankel. Then one day I sent him out in the garden to plant some
                    pertaters and some unyuns fer me, and it jist seemed like that feller didn't
                    have good hoss sense. He planted them unyuns and pertaters right alongside of
                    each other, and the unyuns got into the pertaters' eyes and they couldn't see to
                    grow. Oh, yes, lots of fun down home onct in a while. I calculate I've got the
                    funnyest lot of chickens you ever heerd tell on. I've got sixty old hens and
                    they lay an egg every day; but they don't lay any at nite, cos when nite comes
                    every one of them is roosters. I had one old hen, she went into the woodshed and
                    sot down on the ax and tried to hatch-it. I had another one sottin' on a door
                    knob, tryin' to hatch out a house and lot, but she didn't. While she wuz
                    a-sottin' there along cum a rooster, and he sed, "We're having a little party
                    down behind the barn; will you dance with me this set?" and she sed, "No, sir,
                    I'm engaged to his nobs for this set." Gosh, I wuz afraid to go out in the
                    barnyard one while, cos one day when I wuz out thar I <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002546_0168" n="155"/> heerd a hen
                    say to a rooster, "Thar's that old gray-headed cuss we've bin a-layin' fer."</p>

                <p>Guess that's my train; s'pose I'll have to be a-goin'; good-bye; cum down and see
                    me some time if you kin, ev'ry one of ye; cum down about apple-butter time and
                    jist butt in&mdash;good bye.</p>

                    <l>Happened thar whar the trail runs into the sky;</l>

                    <l>His eyes are too shifty and yaller,</l>

                    <lb/>
                    <l>One day when the mercury wuz way out of sight,</l>

                    <l>With jist the mail sack and specie box,</l>

                    <l>We picked two passengers up at Big Pine,</l>
                    <l>And while the broncos were changed that day</l>
                    <l>I noticed them havin' a sneakin' chat</l>

                    <l>No man wants to see it twice;</l>
                    <l>White and grim as a funeral shroud,</l>
                    <l>A mass of mist and ice.</l>

                    <l>Wall, we hadn't got far from the Big Pine relay</l>
                    <l>When my hair it commenced to rise,</l>
                    <l>For I saw across by the Lone Bear spur</l>
                    <l>A cloud of most monstrous size.</l>
                    <l>And the greaser acted sort of peculiar,</l>
                    <l>And the broncos commenced to neigh;</l>
                    <l>Wall, some thoughts went through my mind jist then</l>

                    <l>The greaser from down Monterey</l>
                    <l>Tried to sneak off with the specie box,</l>

                    <lb/>
                    <l>All at once a figure on hossback</l>
                    <l>Cum a-whoopin' it down the trail,</l>
                    <l>And bullets from out of a Winchester</l>
                    <l>Commenced to fly like hail.</l>

                    <l>The greaser and them two passengers</l>
                    <l>Cashed in their chips to him,</l>
                    <l>Fer the feller what wuz doin' the shootin'</l>
                    <l>Wuz my friend, Yosemite Jim.</l>
                    <lb/>
                    <l>Wall, we planted them thar together,</l>
                    <l>When the cloud had passed away;</l>
                    <l>And all they've got fer a tombstone</l>
                    <l>Is the mountains, dull and gray.</l>

                            the effect of bringing on acute congestion of the lungs, from which few
                            rarely recover. Viewed at a distance it is a magnificent sight, each and
                            every particle of the frozen moisture being a miniature prism, which
                            reflects the sun's rays in a manner once seen never to be

                <p>FER a long time I had my mind made up to go down to Boston, so a short time ago,
                    as I had all my crops and produce mostly sold, I alowed it would be a good time
                    to go down thar, and I sed to mother, "I'll start early in the mornin' and take
                    a load of produce with me, and that will sort of pay expenses of the trip."</p>

                <p>Wall, I got into Boston next mornin' bright and early, 'bout time they had their
                    breakfast, and I looked 'round fer a spell; then finally I picked out a right
                    likely lookin' store, and jist conclooded I'd sell my load of produce thar.
                    Wall, I went in and I met a feller 'nd I sed, "Good mornin', be you the
                    storekeeper?" And he sed, "No, sir, I'm only one of the clerks." So I sed,
                    "Wall, be the storekeeper to hum?" And he sed, "Yes, sir, would you like to see
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0177" n="164"/> him?" And I told him as how I would, and he turned 'round and
                    commenced to hollerin' <hi rend="italic">"front,"</hi> and a boy cum up what had
                    more brass buttins on him than a whole regiment of soljers. I thought that wuz a
                    durned funny name fer a boy&mdash;front&mdash;and that clerk feller he
                    wuz about the most importent thing I'd seen in Boston so far, less maybe it wuz
                    the Bunker Hill monument that I druv past cummin' to town. He had on a biled
                    collar that sort of put me in mind of the whitewashed fence 'round the fair
                    grounds down hum. I'll bet if he'd ever sneeze it would cut his ears off.</p>

                <p>Wall, anyhow, he sed to that front boy, "Show the gentleman to the proprietor's
                    offis." Wall, I went along with that boy, and presently we cum to a place in one
                    corner of that store; it wuz made out of iron and had bars in front of the
                    winders, and looked like the county jale. The front boy p'inted to a man and
                    sed, "Go in," and I sed, "I gessed I wouldn't go in thar, cos I hadn't done
                    anything to be locked up fer." And that front boy commenced to laffin' tho'
                    durned if I could see what he wuz a-laffin' about, and the storekeeper he opened
                    the door and cum out, and he sed, "Good mornin', <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0178" n="165"/> what can I do fer
                    you?" I sed, "Be you the storekeeper?" and he sed he wuz. So I sed, "Do you want
                    to buy any pertaters?" And he sed, "No, sir, we don't buy pertaters here; this a
                    dry goods store." So I sed, "Wall, don't want any cabbage, do ye?" And he sed,
                    "No, sir, this is a dry goods store." So I sed, "Wall, now, I want to know; do
                    you need any onions?" And by chowder, he got madder 'n a wet hen. He sed, "Now
                    look a-heer, I want you to understand onct fer all, this is a dry goods store,
                    and we don't buy anything but dry goods and don't sell anything but dry goods;
                    do you understand me now? <hi rend="italic">Dry Goods</hi>." And I sed, "Yes,
                    gess I understand you; you don't need to git so tarnaly riled about the matter;
                    neer as I can figure it out you jist buy dry goods and sell 'em." And he sed,
                    "Yes, sir, only dry goods." So I sed, "Do you want to buy some mighty good dried
                    apples?"</p>

                <p>Wall, that front boy got to laffin, and a lot of wimmin clerks giggled right out,
                    and the storekeeper he commenced a-laffin', too, and fer about a minnit I
                    thought they'd all went crazy to onct. Wall, he told a feller to show me whar I
                    could sell my <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0179" n="166"/> produce, and I disposed of it at a good bargain.</p>

                <p>I like them Boston folks, they try to make you feel to hum, and enjoy yourself
                    and be soshable, and I wuz chuck full of soshability, too; I wuz goin' up one
                    street and down t'other, jist a-gettin' soshability at ten cents a soshable.</p>

                <p>Wall, I gess I seen about everything wuth seein' in Boston, and I wuz a-standin'
                    alongside of one of their old churches, a-lookin' at the semetry, and I gess
                    thar wuz folks in thar burried nigh unto three hundred years. And I wuz jist
                    a-thinkin' what they'd say if they could wake up and see Boston now, when I
                    noticed a row of little toomstones, and one of them it sed, "Hester Brown,
                    beloved wife of James Brown," and on another it sed, "Prudence Brown, beloved
                    wife of James Brown," and on another it sed, "Thankful Brown, beloved wife of
                    James Brown." Wall, I couldn't jist make out what she had to be thankful about,
                    but I sed, "Jimmy, you had a right lively time while you wuz in Boston, didn't
                    you?" Then I seen another toomstone and on it it sed, "Matilda Brown, beloved
                    wife of James Brown," and another one what sed,</p>


                <pb entity="DSSR_000002546_0180" n="167"/>

                <p>"Sara Ann Brown, beloved wife of James Brown," and over in a little corner, all
                to itself, I seen a toomstone, and on it it sed, "James Brown, At Rest."</p>

                    <l>Who marched in sixty one.</l>

                    <l>I heered the band play Dixie,</l>
                    <l>And my old heart swelled with pride,</l>
                    <l>A-thinkin' of the boys in gray</l>
                    <l>Who marched on the other side.</l>
                    <l>And when my time it comes, mother,</l>
                    <l>The Lord's will it be done,</l>
                    <l>I hope he'll take me to the boys</l>

                <p>&mdash;</p>
                <p>The other books in the series are uniform with this. It is hard to say which one
                    is the funniest. Jackie Coogan's picture was composed of episodes selected from
                    all of the books. Each book is running over with harmless fun, and brings great
                    joy to everyone.</p>
