<head>A Dialogue on Art.</head> 
<div2 type="subsection" id="d9"> 
<p>[*** The following paper had been sent as a contribution to this 
publication scarcely more than a week before its author, Mr. John 
Orchard, died. It was written to commence a series of "Dialogues 
on Art," which death has rendered for ever incomplete: 
nevertheless, the merits of this commencement are such that they 
seemed to warrant its publication as a fragment; and in order 
that the chain of argument might be preserved, so far as it goes, 
uninterrupted, the dialogue is printed entire in the present 
number, despite its length. Of the writer, but little can be 
said. He was an artist; but ill health, almost amounting to 
infirmity&mdash;his portion from childhood&mdash;rendered him unequal to the 
bodily labour inseparable from his profession: and in the course 
of his short life, whose youth was scarcely consummated, he 
exhibited, from time to time, only a very few small pictures, and 
these, as regards public recognition, in no way successfully. In 
art, however, he gave to the "seeing eye," token of that ability 
and earnestness which the "hearing ear" will not fail to 
recognize in the dialogue now published; where the vehicle of  
expression, being more purely intellectual, was more within his 
grasp than was the physical and toilsome embodiment of art.</p> 
<p>  It is possible that a search among the papers he has left, may 
bring to light a few other fugitive pieces, which will, in such 
event, as the Poem succeeding this Dialogue, be published in 
these pages. </p> 
<p>  To the end that the Author's scheme may be, as far as is now 
possible, understood and appreciated, we subjoin, in his own 
words, some explanation of his further intent, and of the views 
and feelings which guided him in the composition of the dialogue:</p> 
<p>  "I have adopted the form of dialogue for several, to me, 
cogent 
reasons; 1st, because it gives the writer the power of exhibiting 
the question, Art, on all its sides; 2nd, because the great 
phases of Art could be represented idiosyncratically; and, to 
make this clear, I have named the several speakers accordingly; 
3rd, because dialogue secures the attention; and, that secured, 
deeper things strike, and go deeper than otherwise they could be 
made to; and, 4th and last, because all my earliest and most 
delightful pleasures associate themselves with dialogue,&mdash;(the old 
dramatists, Lucian, Walter Savage Landor, &amp;c.) </p> 
<p>  "You will find that I have not made one speaker say a thing on 
purpose for another to condemn it; but that I make each one utter 
his wisest in the very wisest manner he can, or rather, that I 
can for him.</p> 
<p>  "The further continuation of this 1st dialogue embraces the 
question <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi>, and its processes, invention and imitation, 
imitation chiefly. Kosmon begins by showing, in illustration of 
the truth of Christian's concluding sentences, how imperfectly 
all the Ancients, excepting the Hebrews, loved, understood, or 
felt Nature, &amp;c. This is not an unimportant portion of Art 
knowledge.</p> 
<p>  "I must not forget to say that the last speech of Kosmon will 
be answered by Christian when they discourse of imitation. It 
properly belongs to imitation; and, under that head, it can be 
most effectively and perfectly confuted. Somewhat after this 
idea, the "verticalism" and "involution" will be shown to be 
direct from Nature; the gilding, &amp;c., disposed of on the ground 
of the old piety using the most precious materials as the most 
religious and worthy of them; and hence, by a very easy and 
probable transition, they concluded that that which was most  
soul-worthy, was also most natural."]</p>

<head>Dialogue I., in the House of Kalon.</head> 
 
<sp>  <speaker>KALON.</speaker><p> Welcome, my friends:&mdash;this day 
above all others; to-day 
is the first day of spring. May it be the herald of a bountiful 
year,&mdash;not alone in harvests of seeds. Great impulses are moving 
through man; swift as the steam-shot shuttle, weaving some mighty 
pattern, goes the new birth of mind. As yet, hidden from eyes is 
the design: whether it be poetry, or painting, or music, or 
architecture, or whether it be a divine harmony of all, no manner 
of mind can tell; but that it is mighty, all manners of minds, 
moved to involuntary utterance, affirm. The intellect has at last 
again got to work upon thought: too long fascinated by matter and 
prisoned to motive geometry, genius &mdash; wisdom seem once more to 
have become human, to have put on man, and to speak with divine 
simplicity. Kosmon, Sophon, again welcome! your journey is 
well-timed; Christian, my young friend, of whom I have often 
written to you, this morning tells me by letter that to-day he 
will pay me his long-promised visit. You, I know, must rejoice to 
meet him: this interchange of knowledge cannot fail to improve 
us, both by knocking down and building up: what is true we shall 
hold in common; what is false not less in common detest. The 
debateable ground, if at last equally debateable as it was at 
first, is yet ploughed; and some after-comer may sow it with 
seed, and reap therefrom a plentiful harvest. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>SOPHON.</speaker><p> Kalon, you speak 
wisely. Truth hath many sides like a 
diamond with innumerable facets, each one alike brilliant and 
piercing. Your information respecting your friend Christian has 
not a little interested me, and made me desirous of knowing him. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KOSMON.</speaker><p> And I, no less than 
Sophon, am delighted to hear that 
we shall both see and taste your friend. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>SOPHON.</speaker><p> Kalon, by what you 
just now said, you would seem to 
think a dearth of original thought in the world, at any time, was 
an evil: perhaps it is not so; nay, perhaps, it is a good! Is not 
an interregnum of genius necessary somewhere? A great genius, 
sun-like, compels lesser suns to gravitate with and to him; and 
this is subversive of originality. Age is as visible in thought 
as it is in man. Death is indispensably requisite for a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> 
life. 
Genius is like a tree, sheltering and affording support to 
numberless creepers and climbers, which latter die and live many 
times before their protecting tree does; flourishing even whilst 
that decays, and thus, lending to it a greenness not its own; but 
no new life can come out of that

  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0014" n="148"/>
expiring tree; 
it must die: and it is not until it is dead, and fallen, and 
<hi rend="italic">rotted into compost</hi>, that another tree can grow 
there; and many years will elapse before the new birth can 
increase and occupy the room the previous one occupied, and 
flourish anew with a greenness all its own. This on one side. On 
another; genius is essentially imitative, or rather, as I just 
now said, gravitative; it gravitates towards that point 
peculiarly important at the moment of its existence; as air, more 
rarified in some places than in others, causes the winds to rush 
towards <hi rend="italic">them</hi> as toward a centre: so that if poetry, painting, or 
music slumbers, oratory may ravish the world, or chemistry, or 
steam-power may seduce and rule, or the sciences sit enthroned. 
Thus, nature ever compensates one art with another; her balance 
alone is the always just one; for, like her course of the 
seasons, she grows, ripens, and lies fallow, only that stronger, 
larger and better food may be reared. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KALON.</speaker><p> By your speaking of 
chemistry, and the mechanical arts 
and sciences, as periodically ruling the world along with poetry, 
painting, and music,&mdash;am I to understand that you deem them powers 
intellectually equal, and to require of their respective 
professors as mighty, original, and <hi rend="italic">human</hi> a genius for their 
successful practice? 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KOSMON.</speaker><p> Human genius! why not? 
Are they not equally human?&mdash;nay, 
are they not&mdash;especially steam-power, chemistry and the electric 
telegraph&mdash;more&mdash;eminently more&mdash;useful to man, more radically 
civilizers, than music, poetry, painting, sculpture, or 
architecture? 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KALON.</speaker><p> Stay, Kosmon! whither 
do you hurry? Between chemistry 
and the mechanical arts and sciences, and between poetry, 
painting, and music, there exists the whole totality of genius&mdash;of 
genius as distinguished from talent and industry. To be useful 
alone is not to be great: <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> only is <hi rend="italic">plus</hi>, and the sum is 
<hi rend="italic">minus</hi> something and <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> in nothing if the most unimaginable 
particle 
only be absent. The fine arts, poetry, painting, sculpture, 
music, and architecture, as thought, or idea, Athene-like, are 
complete, finished, revelations of wisdom at once. Not so the 
mechanical arts and sciences: they are arts of growth; they are 
shaped and formed gradually, (and that, more by a blind sort of 
guessing than by intuition,) and take many men's lives to win 
even to one true principle. On all sides they are the exact 
opposites of each other; for, in the former, the principles from 
the first are mature, and only the manipulation immature; in the 
latter, it is the principles that are almost always immature, and 
the manipulation as constantly mature. The fine arts are always 
grounded upon truth; the mechanical arts and sciences almost 
always upon hypothesis; the first are unconfined, infinite, 
immaterial, impossible


  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0015" n="149"/>
of reduction into 
formulas, or of conversion into machines; the last are limited, 
finite, material, can be uttered through 
formulas, worked by arithmetic, tabulated and seen in machines. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>SOPHON.</speaker><p> Kosmon, you see that 
Kalon, true to his nature, prefers 
the beautiful and good, to the good without the beautiful; and 
you, who love nature, and regard all that she, and what man from 
her, can produce, with equal delight,&mdash;true to your's,&mdash;cannot 
perceive wherefore he limits genius to the fine arts. Let me show 
you why Kalon's ideas are truer than yours. You say that 
chemistry, steam-power, and the electric telegraph, are more 
radically civilizers than poetry, painting, or music: but bethink 
you: what emotions beyond the common and selfish ones of wonder 
and fear do the mechanical arts or sciences excite, or 
communicate? what pity, or love, or other holy and unselfish 
desires and aspirations, do they elicit? Inert of themselves in 
all teachable things, they are the agents only whereby teachable 
things,&mdash;the charities, sympathies and love,&mdash;may be more swiftly 
and more certainly conveyed and diffused: and beyond diffusing 
media the mechanical arts or sciences cannot get; for they are 
merely simple facts; nothing more: they cannot induct; for they, 
in or of themselves, have no inductive powers, and their office 
is confined to that of carrying and spreading abroad the powers 
which do induct; which powers make a full, complete, and visible 
existence only in the fine arts. In FACT and THOUGHT we have the 
whole question of superiority decided. Fact is merely physical  
record: Thought is the application of that record to something 
<hi rend="italic">human</hi>. Without application, the fact is only fact, and nothing 
more; the application, thought, then, certainly must be superior 
to the record, fact. Also in thought man gets the clearest 
glimpse he will ever have of soul, and sees the incorporeal make 
the nearest approach to the corporeal that it is possible for it 
to do here upon earth. And hence, these noble acts of wisdom 
are&mdash;far&mdash;far above the mechanical arts and sciences, and are 
properly called fine arts, because their high and peculiar office 
is to refine. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KOSMON.</speaker><p> But, certainly thought 
is as much exercised in 
deducting from physical facts the sciences and mechanical arts as 
ever it is in poetry, painting, or music. The act of inventing 
print, or of applying steam, is quite as soul-like as the 
inventing of a picture, poem, or statue. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KALON.</speaker><p> Quite. The chemist, 
poet, engineer, or painter, alike, 
think. But the things upon which they exercise their several 
faculties are very widely unlike each other; the chemist or 
engineer cogitates only the physical; the poet or painter joins 
to the physical the human, and investigates soul&mdash;scans the world 
in man added to the world
  
  
   
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0016" n="150"/>
  without him&mdash;takes in 
universal creation, its sights, sounds, aspects, and ideas. Sophon 
says that the fine arts are thoughts; 
but I think I know a more comprehensive word; for they are 
something more than thoughts; they are things also; that word is 
NATURE&mdash;Nature fully&mdash;thorough nature&mdash;the world of creation. All 
that is <hi rend="italic">in</hi> man, his mysteries of soul, his thoughts and 
emotions&mdash;deep, wise, holy, loving, touching, and fearful,&mdash;or in 
the world, beautiful, vast, ponderous, gloomy, and awful, moved 
with rhythmic harmonious utterance&mdash;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is Poetry. All that is 
<hi rend="italic">of</hi> 
man&mdash;his triumphs, glory, power, and passions; or of the world&mdash;its 
sunshine and clouds, its plains, hills or valleys, its wind-swept 
mountains and snowy Alps, river and ocean&mdash;silent, lonely, severe, 
and sublime&mdash;mocked with living colours, hue and tone,&mdash;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is 
Painting. Man&mdash;heroic man, his acts, emotions, loves,&mdash;aspirative, 
tender, deep, and calm,&mdash;intensified, purified, 
colourless,&mdash;exhibited peculiarly and directly through his own 
form; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is sculpture. All the voices of nature&mdash;of man&mdash;his 
bursts of rage, pity, and fear&mdash;his cries of joy&mdash;his sighs of 
love; of the winds and the waters&mdash;tumultuous, hurrying, surging, 
tremulous, or gently falling&mdash;married to melodious numbers; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> 
is music. And, the music of proportions&mdash;of nature and man, and 
the harmony and opposition of light and shadow, set forth in the 
ponderous; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is Architecture. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>CHRISTIAN.</speaker><p> [<hi rend="italic">as he enters</hi>] 
Forbear, Kalon! These I know for your 
dear fiends, Kosmon and Sophon. The moment of discoursing with 
them has at last arrived: May I profit by it! Kalon, fearful of 
checking your current of thought, I stood without, and heard that 
which you said: and, though I agree with you in all your 
definitions of poetry, painting, sculpture, music, and 
architecture; yet certainly all things in or of man, or the 
world, are not, however equally beautiful, equally worthy of 
being used by the artist. Fine art absolutely rejects all 
impurities of form; not less absolutely does it reject all 
impurities of passion and expression. Everything throughout a 
poem, picture, or statue, or in music, may be sensuously 
beautiful; but nothing must be sensually so. Sins are only paid 
for in virtues; thus, every sin found is a virtue lost&mdash;lost&mdash;not 
only to the artist, but a cause of loss to others&mdash;to all who look 
upon what he does. He should deem his art a sacred treasure, 
intrusted to him for the common good; and over it he should 
build, of the most precious materials, in the simplest, chastest, 
and truest proportions, a temple fit for universal worship: 
instead of which, it is too often the case that he raises above 
it an edifice of clay; which, as mortal as his life, falls, 
burying both it and himself under a heap of dirt. To preserve him 
from this corruption of his art, let him erect for

  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0017" n="151"/>

his guidance a standard awfully high above himself. Let him 
think of Christ; and what he would not show to as pure a nature as 
His, let him never be seduced to work on, or expose to the world. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KOSMON.</speaker><p> Oh, Kalon, whither do 
we go! Greek art is condemned, 
and Satire hath got its death-stroke. The beautiful is not the 
beautiful unless it is fettered to the moral; and Virtue rejects 
the physical perfections, lest she should fall in love with 
herself, and sin and cause sin. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>CHRISTIAN.</speaker><p> Nay, Kosmon. 
Nothing pure, nothing that is innocent, 
chaste, unsensual,&mdash;whether Greek or satirical, is condemned: but 
everything&mdash;every picture, poem, statue, or piece of music&mdash;which 
elicits the sensual, viceful, and unholy desires of our 
nature&mdash;is, and that utterly. The beautiful was created the true, 
morally as well as physically; vice is a deformment of 
virtue,&mdash;not of form, to which it is a parasitical addition&mdash;an 
accretion which can and must be excised before the beautiful can 
show itself as it was originally made, morally as well as 
formally perfect. How we all wish the sensual, indecent, and 
brutal, away from Hogarth, so that we might show him to the 
purest virgin without fear or blushing. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>SOPHON.</speaker><p> And as well from 
Shakspere. Rotten members, though 
small in themselves, are yet large enough to taint the whole 
body. And those impurities, like rank growths of vine, may be 
lopped away without injuring any vital principle. In perfect art 
the utmost purity of intention, design, and execution, alone is 
wisdom. Every tree&mdash;every flower, in defiance of adverse 
contingencies, grows with perfect will to be perfect: and, shall 
man, who hath what they have not, a soul wherewith he may defy 
all ill, do less? 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KOSMON.</speaker><p> But how may this 
purity be attained? I see everywhere 
close round the pricks; not a single step may be taken in advance 
without wounding something vital. Corruption strews thick both 
earth and ocean; it is only the heavens that are pure, and man 
cannot live upon manna alone. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>CHRISTIAN.</speaker><p> Kosmon, you would 
seem to mistake what Sophon and I 
mean. Neither he nor I wish nature to be used less, or otherwise 
than as it appears; on the contrary, we wish it used more&mdash;more 
directly. Nature itself is comparatively pure; all that we desire 
is the removal of the factitious matter that the vice of fashion, 
evil hearts, and infamous desires, graft upon it. It is not 
simple innocent nature that we would exile, but the devilish and 
libidinous corruptions that sully nature. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KALON.</speaker><p> But, if your ideas were 
strictly carried out, there 
would be but little of worth left in the world for the artist to 
use; for, if
  
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0018" n="152"/>
  
  I understand you rightly, you 
object to his making use of any 
passion, whether heroic, patriotic, or loving, that is not 
rigidly virtuous. 
</p></sp><sp><speaker> CHRISTIAN.</speaker><p> I do. Without he has 
a didactic aim; like as Hogarth 
had. A picture, poem, or statue, unless it speaks some purpose, 
is mere paint, paper, or stone. A work of art must have a 
purpose, or it is not a work of <hi rend="italic">fine</hi> art: thus, then, if it be 
a 
work of fine art, it has a purpose; and, having purpose, it has 
either a good or an evil one: there is no alternative. An 
artist's works are his children, his immortal heirs, to his evil 
as well as to his good; as he hath trained them, so will they 
teach. Let him ask himself why does a parent so tenderly rear his 
children. Is it not because he knows that evil is evil, whether 
it take the shape of angels or devils? And is not the parent's 
example worthy of the artist's imitation? What advantage has a 
man over a child? Is there any preservative peculiar to manhood 
that it alone may see and touch sin, and yet be not defiled? 
Verily, there is none! All mere battles, assassinations, 
immolations, horrible deaths, and terrible situations used by the 
artist solely to excite,&mdash;every passion degrading to man's perfect 
nature,&mdash;should certainly be rejected, and that unhesitatingly. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>SOPHON.</speaker><p>&mdash;Suffer me to extend 
the just conclusions of Christian. 
Art&mdash;true art&mdash;fine art&mdash;cannot be either coarse or 
low. Innocent-like, no taint will cling to it, and a smock frock 
is as pure as "virginal-chaste robes." And,&mdash;sensualism, 
indecency, and brutality, excepted&mdash;sin is not sin, if not in the 
act; and, in satire, with the same exceptions, even sin in the 
act is tolerated when used to point forcibly a moral crime, or to 
warn society of a crying shame which it can remedy. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KALON.</speaker><p> But, my dear Sophon,&mdash;and you, 
Christian,&mdash;you do not 
condemn the oak because of its apples; and, like them, the sin in 
the poem, picture, or statue, may be a wormy accretion grafted 
from without. The spectator often makes sin where the artist 
intended none. For instance, in the nude,&mdash;where perhaps, the 
poet, painter, or sculptor, imagines he has embodied only the 
purest and chastest ideas and forms, the sensualist sees&mdash;what he 
wills to see; and, serpent-like, previous to devouring his prey, 
he covers it with his saliva. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>CHRISTIAN.</speaker><p> The Circean poison, 
whether drunk from the clearest 
crystal or the coarsest clay, alike intoxicates and makes beasts 
of men. Be assured that every nude figure or nudity introduced in 
a poem, picture, or piece of sculpture, merely on physical 
grounds, and only for effect, is vicious. And, where it is boldly 
introduced and forms the central idea, it ought never to have a 
sense
  
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0019" n="153"/> 
  
  of its condition: it is not nudity that is 
sinful, but the 
figure's knowledge of its nudity,(too surely communicated by it 
to the spectator,) that makes it so. Eve and Adam before their 
fall were not more utterly shameless than the artist ought to 
make his inventions. The Turk believes that, at the judgment-day, 
every artist will be compelled to furnish, from his own soul, 
soul for every one of his creations. This thought is a noble one, 
and should thoroughly awake poet, painter, and sculptor, to the 
awful responsibilities they labour under. With regard to the 
sensualist,&mdash;who is omnivorous, and swine-like, assimilates 
indifferently pure and impure, degrading everything he hears or 
sees,&mdash;little can be said beyond this; that for him, if the artist 
<hi rend="italic">be</hi> without sin, he is not answerable. But in this responsibility 
he has two rigid yet just judges, God and himself; let him answer 
there before that tribunal. God will acquit or condemn him only 
as he can acquit or condemn himself. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KALON.</speaker><p> But, under any 
circumstance, beautiful nude flesh 
beautifully painted must kindle sensuality; and, described as 
beautifully in poetry, it will do the like, almost, if not quite, 
as readily. Sculpture is the only form of art in which it can be 
used thoroughly pure, chaste, unsullied, and unsullying. I feel, 
Christian, that you mean this. And see what you do! What a vast 
domain of art you set a Solomon's seal upon! how numberless 
are the poems, pictures, and statues&mdash;the most beautiful 
productions of their authors&mdash;you put in limbo! To me, I confess, 
it appears the very top of prudery to condemn these lovely 
creations, merely because they quicken some men's pulses. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KOSMON.</speaker><p> And, to me, it appears 
hypercriticism to object to 
pictures, poems, and statues, calling them not works of art&mdash;or 
fine art&mdash;because they have no higher purpose than eye or 
ear-delight. If this law be held to be good, very few pictures 
called of the English school&mdash;of the English school, did I 
say?&mdash;very few pictures at all, of any school, are safe from 
condemnation: almost all the Dutch must suffer judgment, and a 
very large proportion of modern sculpture, poetry, and music, 
will not pass. Even "Christabel" and the "Eve of St. Agnes" could 
not stand the ordeal. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>CHRISTIAN.</speaker><p> Oh, Kalon, you 
hardly need an answer! What! shall 
the artist spend weeks and months, nay, sometimes years, in 
thought and study, contriving and perfecting some beautiful 
invention,&mdash;in order only that men's pulses may be quickened? 
What!&mdash;can he, jesuit-like, dwell in the house of soul, only to 
discover where to sap her foundations? Satan-like, does he turn 
his angel of light into a fiend of darkness, and use his 
God-delegated might against its giver, making Astartes and 
Molochs to draw other thousands
  
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0020" n="154"/>
  
  of innocent 
lives into the embrace of sin? And as for you, Kosmon, I regard 
purpose as I regard soul; one is not more the 
light of the thought than the other is the light of the body; and 
both, soul and purpose, are necessary for a complete intellect; 
and intellect, of the intellectual&mdash;of which the fine arts are the 
capital members&mdash;is not more to be expected than demanded. I 
believe that most of the pictures you mean are mere natural 
history paintings from the animal side of man. The Dutchmen may, 
certainly, go Letheward; but for their colour, and subtleties of 
execution, they would not be tolerated by any man of taste. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>SOPHON.</speaker><p> Christian here, I 
think, is too stringent. Though walls 
be necessary round our flower gardens to keep out swine and other 
vile cattle&mdash;yet I can see no reason why, with excluding beasts, 
we should also exclude light and air. Purpose is purpose or not, 
according to the individual capacity to assimilate it. Different 
plants require different soils, and they will rather die than 
grow on unfriendly ones; it is the same with animals; they endure 
existence only through their natural food; and this variety of 
soils, plants, and vegetables, is the world less man. But man, as 
well as the other created forms, is subject to the same law; he 
takes only that aliment he can digest. It is sufficient with some 
men that their sensoria be delighted with pleasurable and 
animated grouping, colour, light, and shade: this feeling or 
desire of their's is, in itself, thoroughly innocent: it is 
true, it is not a great burden for them to carry; no, but it is 
the lightness of the burden that is the merit; for thereby, their 
step is quickened and not clogged, their intellect is exhilarated 
and not oppressed. Thus, then, a purpose is secured, from a 
picture or poem or statue, which may not have in it the smallest 
particle of what Christian and I think necessary for it to 
possess; he reckons a poem, picture, or statue, to be a work of 
fine art by the quality and quantity of thought it contains, by 
the mental leverage it possesses wherewith to move his mind, by 
the honey which he may hive, and by the heavenly manna he may 
gather therefrom. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KOSMON.</speaker><p> Christian wants art 
like Magdalen Hospitals, where the 
windows are so contrived that all of earth is excluded, and only 
heaven is seen. Wisdom is not only shown in the soul, but also in 
the body: the bones, nerves, and muscles, are quite as wonderful 
in idea as is the incorporeal essence which rules them. And the 
animal part of man wants much caring for as the spiritual: God 
made both, and is equally praised through each. And men's souls 
are as much touchable and teachable through their animal feelings 
as ever they are through their mental aspirations; this both 
Orpheus and Amphion knew when they, with their music, made towns 
to rise in
  
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0021" n="155"/> 
  
  savage woods by savage hands.  And 
hence, in that light, nothing 
is without a purpose; and I maintain,&mdash;if they give but the least 
glimpse of happiness to a single human being, that even the Dutch 
masters are useful, I believe that the thought-wrapped 
philosopher, who, in his close-pent study, designs some valuable 
blessing for his lower and more animal brethren, only pursues the 
craving of his nature; and that his happiness is no higher than 
their's in their several occupations and delights.  Sight and 
sense are fully as powerful for happiness as thought and 
ratiocination.  Nature grows flowers wherever she can; she causes 
sweet waters to ripple over stony beds, and living wells to 
spring up in deserts, so that grass and herbs may grow and afford 
nourishment to <hi rend="italic">some</hi> of God's creatures.  Even the granite 
and the lava must put forth blossoms. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KALON.</speaker><p>  Oh Christian, children 
cannot digest strong meats!  
Neither can a blind man be made to see by placing him opposite 
the sun.  The sound of the violin is as innocent as that of the 
organ.  And, though there be a wide difference in the sacredness 
of the occupations, yet dance, song, and the other amusements 
common to society, are quite as necessary to a healthy condition 
of the mind and body, as is to the soul the pursuit and daily 
practice of religion.  The healthy condition of the mind and body 
is, after all, the happy life; and whether that life be most 
mental or most animal it matters little, even before God, so long 
as its delights, amusements, and occupations, be thoroughly 
innocent and chaste. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>CHRISTIAN.</speaker><p>  So long as the 
pursuits, pastimes, and pleasures 
of mankind be innocent and chaste,&mdash;with you all, heartily, I 
believe it matters little how or in what form they be enjoyed. 
Pure water is certainly equally pure, whether it trickle from the 
hill-side or flow through crystal conduits; and equally 
refreshing whether drunk from the iron bowl or the golden goblet; 
only the crystal and gold will better please some natures than 
the hill-side and the iron.  I know also that a star may give 
more light than the moon, but that is up in its own heavens and 
not here on earth.  I know that it is not light and shade which 
make a complete globe, but, as well, the local and neutral tints. 
Thus, my friends, you perceive that I am neither for building a 
wall, nor for contriving windows so as to exclude light, air, and 
earth.  As much as any of you, I am for every man's sitting under 
his own vine, and for his training, pruning, and eating its fruit 
how he pleases.  Let the artist paint, write, or carve, what and 
how he wills, teach the world through sense or through thought,&mdash; 
I will not dissent; I have no patent to entitle me to do so; nay, 
I will be thoroughly satisfied with whatsoever he does, so long 
as it is pure, unsensual, and earnestly true.  But, as the 
mental
  
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0022" n="156"/>
  
  is the peculiar feature that places man 
apart from and above 
animals,&mdash;so ought all that he does to be apart from and above 
their nature;  especially in the fine arts, which are the 
intellectual perfection of the intellectual.  And nothing short 
of this intellectual perfection, however much they may be 
pictures, poems, statues, or music,&mdash;can rank such works to be 
works of Fine Art. They may have merit,&mdash;nay, be useful, and 
hence, in some sort, have a purpose:  but they are as much works 
of Fine Art as Babel was the Temple of Solomon.    
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>SOPHON.</speaker><p>  And man can be made 
to understand these truths&mdash;can 
be drawn to crave for and love the fine arts:  it is only to take 
him in hand as we would take some animal&mdash;tenderly using it&mdash; 
entreating it, as it were, to do its best&mdash;to put forth all its 
powers with all its capable force and beauty.  Nor is it so very 
difficult a task to raise, in the low, conceptions of things 
high:  the mass of men have a fine appreciation of God and his 
goodness:  and as active, charitable, and sympathetic a nurture 
in the beautiful and true as they have given to them in religion, 
would as surely and swiftly raise in them an equally high 
appreciation of the fine arts.  But, if the artist would essay 
such a labour, he must show them what fine art is:  and, in order 
to do this effectually, as a architect clears away from some 
sacred edifice which he restores the shambles and shops, which, 
like filthy toads cowering on a precious monument, have squatted 
themselves round its noble proportions; so must he remove from 
his art-edifice the deformities which hide&mdash;the corruptions which 
shame it. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>CHRISTIAN.</speaker><p>  How truly Sophon 
speaks a retrospective look will 
show.  The disfigurements which both he and I deplore are 
strictly what he compared them to; they are shambles and shops 
grafted on a sacred edifice.  Still, indigenous art is sacred and 
devoted to religious purposes:  this keeps it pure for a time;  
but, like a stream travelling and gathering other streams as it 
goes through wide stretches of country to the sea, it receives 
greater and more numerous impurities the farther it gets from its 
source, until, at last, what was, in its rise, a gentle rilling 
through snows and over whitest stones, roars into the ocean a 
muddy and contentious river.  Men soon long to touch and taste 
all that they see; savage-like, him whom to-day they deem a god 
and worship, they on the morrow get an appetite for and kill, to 
eat and barter.  And thus art is degraded, made a thing of carnal 
desire&mdash;a commodity of the exchange.  Yes, Sophon, to be 
instructive, to become a teaching instrument, the art-edifice 
must be cleansed from its abominations; and, with them, must the 
artist sweep out the improvements and ruthless restorations that 
hang on it like formless botches on peopled tapestry.  
The
  
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0023" n="157"/> 
  
  multitude must be brought to stand face to 
face with the pious 
and earnest builders, to enjoy the severely simple, beautiful, 
aspiring, and solemn temple, in all its first purity, the same as 
they bequeathed it to them as their posterity. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KALON.</speaker><p>  The peasant, upon 
acquaintance, quickly prefers 
wheaten bread to the black and sour mass that formerly served 
him: and when true jewels are placed before him, counterfeit ones 
in his eyes soon lose their lustre, and become things which he 
scorns.  The multitude are teachable&mdash;teachable as a child; but, 
like a child, they are self-willed and obstinate, and will learn 
in their own way, or not at all.  And, if the artist wishes to 
raise them unto a fit audience, he must consult their very 
waywardness, or his work will be a Penelope's web of done and 
undone:  he must be to them not only cords of support staying 
their every weakness against sin and temptation, but also, 
tendrils of delight winding around them.  But I cannot understand 
why regeneration can flow to them through sacred art alone.  All 
pure art is sacred art.  And the artist having soul as well as 
nature&mdash;the lodestar as well as the lodestone&mdash;to steer his path 
by&mdash;and seeing that he must circle earth&mdash;it matters little from 
what quarter he first points his course; all that is necessary is 
that he go as direct as possible, his knowledge keeping him from 
quicksands and sunken rocks. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>CHRISTIAN.</speaker><p>  Yes, Kalon;&mdash;and, 
to compare things humble though 
conceived in the same spirit of love&mdash;with things mighty, the 
artist, if he desires to inform the people thoroughly, must 
imitate Christ, and, like him, stoop down to earth and become 
flesh of their flesh; and his work should be wrought out with all 
his soul and strength in the same world-broad charity, and truth, 
and virtue, and be, for himself as well as for them, a 
justifications for his teaching.  But all art, simply because it 
is pure and perfect, cannot, for those grounds alone, be called 
sacred:  Christian, it may, and that justly; for only since 
Christ taught have morals been considered a religion.  Christian 
and sacred art bear that relation to each other that the circle 
bears to its generating point; the first is only volume, the last 
is power:  and though the first&mdash;as the world includes God&mdash; 
includes with it the last, still, the last is the greatest, for 
it makes that which includes it:  thus all pure art is Christian, 
but not all is sacred.  Christian art comprises the earth and its 
humanities, and, by implication, God and Christ also; and sacred 
art is the emanating idea&mdash;the central causating power&mdash;the 
jasper throne, whereon sits Christ, surrounded by the prophets, 
apostles, and saints, administering judgement, wisdom, and 
holiness.  In this sense, then, the art you would call sacred is 
not sacred, but Christian:  and, as <hi rend="italic">all perfect art</hi>

  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0024" n="158"/>

<hi rend="italic"> is Christian</hi>, regeneration necessarily can only flow thence; 
and thus it is, as you say, that, from whatever quarter the artist 
steers his course, he steers aright. 
</p></sp><sp> <speaker>KOSMON.</speaker><p>  And, Christian, is a 
return to this sacred or 
Christian art by you deemed possible?  I question it.  How can 
you get the art of one age to reflect that of another, when the 
image to be reflected is without the angle of reflection?  The 
sun cannot be seen of us when it is night!  and that class of art 
has got its golden age too remote&mdash;its night too long set&mdash;for it 
to hope ever to grasp rule again, or again to see its day break 
upon it.  You have likened art to a river rising pure, and 
rolling a turbid volume into the ocean.  I have a comparison 
equally just.  The career of one artist contains in itself the 
whole of art-history; its every phase is presented by him in the 
course of his life.  Savage art is beheld in his childish 
scratchings and barbarous glimmerings;  Indian, Egyptian, and 
Assyrian art in his boyish rigidity and crude fixedness of idea 
and purpose;  Mediaeval, or pre-Raffaelle art is seen in his 
youthful timid darings, his unripe fancies oscillating between 
earth and heaven; there where we expect truth, we see conceit; 
there where we want little, much is given&mdash;now a blank eye 
riddle,&mdash;dark with excess of self, now a giant thought&mdash;vast but 
repulsive,&mdash;and now angel visitors startling us with wisdom and 
touches of heavenly beauty.  Every where is seen exactness; but 
it is the exactness of hesitation, and not of knowledge&mdash;the line 
of doubt, and not of power:  all the promises for ripeness are 
there; but, as yet, all are immature.  And mature art is 
presented when all these rude scaffoldings are thrown down&mdash;when 
the man steps out of the chrysalis a complete idea&mdash;both Psyche 
and Eros free-thoughted, free-tongued, and free-handed; a being 
whose soul moves through the heavens and the earth&mdash;now choiring 
it with angels&mdash;and now enthroning it, bay-crowned, among the 
men-kings;&mdash;whose hand passes over all earth, spreading forth its 
beauties unerring as the seasons&mdash;stretches through cloudland, 
revealing its delectable glories, or, eagle-like, soars right up 
against the sun;&mdash;or seaward goes seizing the cresting foam as it 
leaps&mdash;the ships and their crews as they wallow in the watery 
valleys or climb their steeps, or hang over their flying ridges:  
daring and doing all whatsoever it shall dare to do, with 
boundless fruitfullness of idea, and power, and line; that is 
mature art&mdash;art of the time of Phidias, of Raffaelle, and of 
Shakspere.  And, Christian, in preferring the art of the period 
previous to Raffaelle to the art of his time, you set up the 
worse for the better, elevate youth above manhood, and tell us 
that the half-formed and unripe berry is wholesomer than the 
perfect and ripened fruit.

  <sp>  <speaker>CHRISTIAN.</speaker><p>  
Kosmon, your thoughts seduce you; or rather, your 
nature prefers the full and rich to the exact and simple: you do 
not go deep enough&mdash;do not penetrate beneath the image'sgilt 
overlay, and see that it covers only worm-devoured wood. Your, 
very comparison tells against you.  What you call ripeness, 
other, with as much truth, may call over-ripeness, nay, even 
rottenness; when all the juices are drunk with their 
lusciousness, sick with over-sweetness.  And the art which you 
call youthful and immature&mdash;may be, most likely is, mature and 
wholesome in the same degree that it is tasteful, a perfect round 
of beautiful, pure, and good.  You call youth immature; but in 
what does it come short of manhood.  Has it not all that man can 
have,&mdash;free, happy, noble, and spiritual thoughts?  And are not 
those thoughts newer, purer, and more unselfish in the youth than 
in the man?  What eye has the man, that the youth's is not as 
comprehensive, keen, rapid, and penetrating?  or what hand, that 
the youth's is not as swift, forceful, cunning, and true?  And 
what does the youth gain in becoming man?  Is it freshness, or 
deepness, or power, or wisdom?  nay rather&mdash;is it not languor&mdash; 
the languor of satiety&mdash;of indifferentism?  And thus soul-rusted 
and earth-charmed, what mate is he for his former youth?  Drunken 
with the world-lees, what can he do but pourtray nature drunken 
as well, and consumed with the same ferver or stupor that 
consumes himself, making up with gilding and filigree what he 
lacks in truth and sincerity?  and what comparison shall exist 
here and between what his youth might or could have done, with a 
soul innocent and untroubled as heaven's deep calm of blue, 
gazing on earth with seraph eyes&mdash;looking, but not longing&mdash;or, 
in the spirit rapt away before the emerald-like rainbow-crowned 
throne, witnessing "things that shall be hereafter," and drawing 
them down almost as stainless as he beheld them?  What an array 
of deep, earnest, and noble thinkers, like angels armed with a 
brightness that withers, stand between Giotto and Raffaelle; to 
mentions only Oreagna, Ghiberti, Masaccio, Lippi, Fra Beato 
Angelico, and Francia.  Parallel <hi rend="italic">them</hi> with post-Raffaelle 
artists?  If you think you can, you have dared a labour of which 
the fruit shall be to you as Dead Sea apples, golden and sweet to 
the eye, but, in the mouth, ashes and bitterness.  And the 
Phidian era was a youthful one&mdash;the highest and purest period of 
Hellenic art:  after that time they added no more gods or heroes, 
but took for models instead the Alcibiadeses and Phyrnes, and 
made Bacchuses and Aphrodites;  not as Phidias would have&mdash; 
clothed with the greatness of thought, or girded with valour, or 
veiled with modesty; but dissolved with the voluptuousness of the 
bath, naked, wanton, and shameless. 
  </p></sp>
  
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0026" n="160"/>
  
  <sp> <speaker>SOPHON.</speaker><p>  You 
hear, Kosmon, that Christian prefers ripe youth 
to ripe manhood:  and he is right.  Early summer is nobler than 
early autumn; the head is wiser than the hand.  You take the hand 
to mean too much:  you should not judge by quantity, or 
luxuriance, or dexterity, but by quality, chastity, and fidelity. 
And colour and tone are only a fair setting to thought and 
virtue.  Perhaps it is the fate, or rather the duty, of mortals 
to make a sacrifice for all things, withheld as well as given.  
Hand sometimes succumbs to head, and head in its turn succumbs to 
hand; the first is the lot of youth, the last of manhood.  The 
question is&mdash;which of the two we can best afford to do without.  
Narrowed down to this, I think but very few men would be found 
who would not sacrifice in the loss of hand in preference to its 
gain at the loss of head. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KOSMON.</speaker><p>  But, Christian, in 
advocating a return to this pre-Raffaelle art, are you not&mdash;you yourself&mdash;urging the committal of 
"ruthless restorations" and "improvements,"  new and vile as any 
that you have denounced?  You tell the artist, that he should 
restore the sacred edifice to its first purity&mdash; the same as it 
was bequeathed by its pious and earnest builders.  But can he do 
this and be himself original?  For myself, I would above all 
things urge him to study how to <hi rend="italic">reproduce</hi>, and not how to 
represent&mdash;to imitate no past perfection, but to create for 
himself another, as beautiful, wise, and true.  I would say to 
him, "build not on old ground, profaned, polluted, trod into 
slough by filthy animals; but break new ground&mdash;virgin ground&mdash; 
ground that thought has never imagined or eye seen, and dig into 
our hearts a foundation, deep and broad as our humanity.  Let it 
not be a temple formed of hands only, but built up of 
<hi rend="italic">us</hi>&mdash;us of the present&mdash;body of our body, soul of our 
soul." 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>CHRISTIAN.</speaker><p>  When men wish to 
raise a piece of stone, or to 
move it along, they seek for a fulcrum to use their lever from; 
and, this obtained, they can place the stone wheresoever they 
please.  And world-perfections come into existence too slowly for 
men to reject all the teaching and experience of 
theirpredecessors:  the labour of learning is trifling compared 
to the labour of finding out; the first implies only days, the 
last, hundreds of years.  The discovery of the new world without 
the compass would have been sheer chance; but with it, it became 
an absolute certainty.  So, and in such manner, the modern artist 
seeks to use early mediaeval art, as a fulcrum to raise through, 
but only as a fulcrum; for he himself holds the lever, whereby he 
shall both guide and fix the stones of his art temple; as 
experience, which shall be to him a 
  
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0027" n="161"/>
  
  rudder 
directing the motion of his ship, but in subordination to his 
control; and as a compass, which shall regulate his journey, 
but which, so far from taking away his liberty, shall even add to 
it, because through it his course is set so fast in the ways of 
truth as to allow him, undividedly, to give up his whole soul to 
the purpose of his voyage, and to steer a wider and freer path 
over the trackless, but to him, with his rudder and compass, no 
longer the trackless or waste ocean; for, God and his endeavours 
prospering him, that shall yield up unto his hands discoveries as 
man-worthy as any hitherto beheld by men, or conceived by poets. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KALON.</speaker><p>  But, Christian, 
another artist with equal justness 
might use Hellenic art as a means toward making happy 
discoveries; formatively, there is nothing in it that is not both 
beautiful and perfect; and beautiful things, rainbow-like, are 
once and for ever beautiful; and the contemplation and study of 
its dignified, graceful, and truthful embodiments&mdash;which, by 
common consent, it only is allowed to possess in an eminent and 
universal degree&mdash;is full as likely to awaken in the mind of its 
student as high revelations of wisdom, and cause him to bear to 
earth as many perfections for man, as ever the study of pre-Raffaelle art can reveal or give, through its votary. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>CHRISTIAN.</speaker><p>  But beautiful 
things, to be beautiful in the 
highest degree, like the rainbow, must have a spiritual as well 
as a physical voice.  Lovely as it is, it is not the arch of 
colours that glows in the heavens of our hearts; what does, is 
the inner and invisible sense for which it was set up of old by 
God, and of which its many-hued form is only the outward and 
visible sign.  Thus, beautiful things alone, of themselves, are 
not sufficient for this task; to be sufficient they must be as 
vital with soul as they are with shape.  To be formatively 
perfect is not enough; they must also be spiritually perfect, and 
this not <hi rend="italic">locally</hi> but universally.  The art of the Greeks 
was a local art; and hence, now, it has no spiritual.  Their gods 
speak to us no longer as gods, or teach us divinely:  they have 
become mere images of stone&mdash;profane embodiments.  False to our 
spiritual, Hellenic art wants every thing that Christian art is 
full of.  Sacred and universal, this clasps us, as Abraham's 
bosom did Lazarus, within its infinite embraces, causing every 
fibre of our being to quicken under its heavenly truths.  
Ithuriel's golden spear was not more antagonistic to Satan's 
loathly transformation&mdash;than is Christian opposed to pagan art.  
The wide, the awful gulf, separating one from the other, will be 
felt instantly in its true force by first thinking ZEUS, and then 
thinking CHRIST.  How pale, shadowy, and shapeless the vision of 
lust, 
  
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0028" n="162"/>
  
  revenge, and impotence, that rises at the 
thought of Zeus; but at 
the thought of Christ, how overwhelming the inrush of sublime and 
touching realities; what height and depth of love and power; what 
humility, and beauty, and immaculate purity are made ours at the 
mention of his name; the Saviour, the Intercessor, the Judge, the 
Resurrection and the Life.  These&mdash;these are the divinely awful 
truths taught by our faith; and which should also be taught by 
our art.  Hellenic art, like the fig tree that only bore leaves, 
withered at Christ's coming; and thus no "happy discoveries" can 
flow thence, or "revelations of wisdom," or other perfections be 
borne to earth for man. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>SOPHON.</speaker><p>  Christian thinks and 
says, that if the spiritual be 
not <hi rend="italic">in</hi> a thing, it cannot be put upon it; and hence, if a 
work of art be not a god, it must be a man, or a mere image of 
one; and that the faith of the Pagan is the foolishness of the 
Christian. Nor does he utter unreason; for, notwithstanding their 
perfectforms, their gods are not gods to us, but only perfect 
forms: Apollo, Theseus, the Ilissus, Aphrodite, Artemis, Psyche, 
and Eros, are only shapeful manhood, womanhood, virginhood, and 
youth, and move us only by the exact amount of humanity they 
possess in common with ourselves.  <hi rend="italic">Homer and AEschylys, and 
Sophocles, and Phidias, live not by the sacred in them, but by 
the human</hi>:  and, but for this common bond, Hellenic art would 
have been submerged in the same Lethe that has drowned the 
Indian, Egyptian, and Assyrian Theogonies and arts.  And, if we 
except form, what other thing does Hellenic art offer to the 
modern artist, that is not thoroughly opposed to his faith, 
wants, and practice?  And thought&mdash;thought in accordance with all 
the lines of his knowledge, temperament, and habits&mdash;thought 
through which he makes and shapes for men, and is understood by 
them&mdash;it is as destitute of, as inorganic matter of soul and 
reason.  But Christian art, because of the faith upon which it is 
built, suffers under no such drawbacks, for that faith is as 
personal and vigorous now as ever it was at its origin&mdash;every 
motion and principle of our being moves to it like a singing 
harmony; it is the breath which brings out of us, AEolian-harp-like, our most penetrating and heavenly music&mdash;the river of the 
water of life, which searches all our dry parts and nourishes 
them, causing them to spring up and bear abundantly the happy 
seed which shall enrich and make fat the earth to the uttermost 
parts thereof. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KALON.</speaker><p>  With you both I 
believe, that faith is necessary to 
a man, and that without faith sight even is feeble:  but I also 
believe that a man is as much a part of the religious, moral, and 
social system in which he lives, as is a plant of the soil, 
situation, and
  
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0029" n="163"/>
  
  climate in which it exists:  and 
that external applications have 
just as much power to change the belief of the man, as they have 
to alter the structure of the plant.  A faith once in a man, it 
is there always; and, though unfelt even by himself, works 
actively:  and Hellenic art, so far from being an impediment to 
the Christian belief, is the exact reverse; for it is the 
privilege of that belief, through its sublime alchymy, to be able 
to transmute all it touches into itself:  and tho perfect forms 
of Hellenic art, so touched, move our souls only the more 
energetically upwards, because of their transcendent beauty; for 
through them alone can we see how wonderfully and divinely God 
wrought&mdash;how majestic, powerful, and vigorous he made man&mdash;how 
lovely, soft, and winning, he made woman:  and in beholding these 
things, we are thankful to him that we are permitted to see them--not as Pagans, but altogether as Christians.  Whether Christian 
or Pagan, the highest beauty is still the highest beauty;  and 
the highest beauty alone, to the total exclusion of gods and 
their myths, compels our admiration. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KOSMON.</speaker><p>  Another thing we 
ought to remember, when judging 
Hellenic Art, is, but for its existence, all other kinds&mdash;pre-Raffaelle as well&mdash;could not have had being.  The Greeks were, by 
far, more inclined to worship nature as contained in themselves, 
than the gods,&mdash;if the gods are not reflexes of themselves, which 
is most likely.  And, thus impelled, they broke through the 
monstrous symbolism of Egypt, and made them gods after their own 
hearts; that is, fashioned them out of themselves.  And herein, I 
think we may discern something of providence; for, suppose their 
natures had not been so powerfully antagonistic to the traditions 
and conventions of their religion, what other people in the world 
could or would have done their work?  Cast about a brief while in 
your memories, and endeavor to find whether there has ever 
existed a people who in their nature, nationality, and religion, 
have been so eminently fitted to perform such a task as the 
Hellenic?  You will then feel that we have reason to be thankful 
that they were allowed to do what else had never been done; and 
which not done, all posterity would have suffered to the last 
throe of time.  And, if they have not made a thorough perfection
&mdash; a spiritual as well as a physical one&mdash;forget not that, at 
least, they have made this physical representation a finished 
one.  They took it from the Egyptians, rude clumsy, and seated; 
its head stony&mdash;pinned to its chest; its hands tied to its side, 
and its legs joined; they shaped it beautiful, majestic, and 
erect; elevated its head; breathed into it animal fire; gave 
movement and action to its arms and hands; opened its legs and 
made it walk&mdash;made it human at all points&mdash;the radical

  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0030" n="164"/>
impersonation of physical and sensuous beauty.  And, if the 
god 
has receded into the past and become a "pale, shadowy, and 
shapeless vision of lust, revenge, and impotence," the human 
lives on graceful, vigorous, and deathless, as at first, and 
excites in us admiration as unbounded as ever followed it of old 
in Greece or Italy. 
 </p></sp>
<sp>  <speaker>CHRISTIAN.</speaker><p>  Yes, Kosmon, yes!  
they are flourished all over 
with the rhetoric of the body; but nowhere is to be seen in them 
that diviner poetry, the oratory of the soul!  Truly they are a 
splendid casket enclosing nothing&mdash;at least nothing now of 
importance to us; for what they once contained, the world, when 
stirred with nobler matter, disregarded, and left to perish.  
But, Kosmon, we cannot discuss probabilities.  Our question is&mdash; 
not whether the Greeks only could have made such masterpieces of 
nature and art; but whether their works of that kind the <hi rend="italic">most 
fitted</hi> to carry forward to a more ultimate perfection that 
idea which is peculiarly our's.  All art, more or less, is a 
species of symbolism; and the Hellenic, notwithstanding its more 
universal method of typification, was fully as symbolic as the 
Egyptian; and hence its language is not only dead, but forgotten, 
and is now past recovery: and, if it were not, what purpose would 
be served by its republication?  For, for whom does the artist 
work?  The inevitable answer is, "For his nation!"  His statue, 
or picture, poem, or music, must be made up and out of them; they 
are at once his exemplars, his audience, and his worshippers; and 
he is their mirror in which they behold themselves as they are:  
he breathes them vitally as an atmosphere, and they breathe him.  
Zeus, Athene, Heracles, Prometheus, Agamemnon, Orestes, the House 
of OEdipus, Clytemnestra, Iphigenia, and Antigone, spoke 
something to the Hellenic nations; woke their piety, pity, or 
horror,&mdash;thrilled, soothed, or delighted them; but they have no 
charm for our ears; for us, they are literally disembodied 
ghosts, and voiceless as shapeless.  But not so are Christ, and 
the holy Apostles and saints, and the Blessed Virgin; and not so 
is Hamlet, or Richard the Third, or Macbeth, or Shylock, or the 
House of Lear, Ophelia, Desdemona, Grisildis, or Una, or 
Genevieve. No: <hi rend="italic">they</hi> all speak and move real and palpable 
before our eyes, and are felt deep down in the heart's core of 
every thinking soul among us:&mdash;they all grapple to us with holds 
that only life will loose.  Of all this I feel assured, because, 
a brief while since, we agreed together that man could only be 
raised through an incarnation of himself.  Tacitly, we would also 
seem to have limited the uses of Hellenic art to the serving as 
models of proportion, or as a gradus for form:  and, though I 
cannot deny them any merit they may have in this respect, still, 
I would wish to deal cautiously with them:  the 
artist,&mdash;most
  
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0031" n="165"/>
  especially the young one, and who 
is and would be most subject to 
them and open to their influence,&mdash;should never have his soul 
asleep when his hand is awake; but, like voice and instrument, 
one should always accompany the other harmoniously. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KOSMON.</speaker><p>  But surely you will 
deal no less cautiously with 
early mediaeval art.  Archaisms are not more tolerable in 
pictures than they are in statues, poems, or music; and the 
archaisms of this kind of art are so numerous as to be at first 
sight the most striking feature belonging to it.  Most remarkable 
among these unnatural peculiarities are gilded backgrounds, 
gilded hair, gilded ornaments and borders to draperies and 
dresses, the latter's excessive verticalism of lines and tedious 
involution of folds, and the childlike passivity of countenance 
and expression:  all of which are very prominent, and operate as 
serious drawbacks to their merits; which&mdash;as I have freely 
admitted&mdash;are in truth not a few, nor mean. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>CHRISTIAN.</speaker><p>  The artist is only 
a man, and living with other 
men in a state of being called society; and,&mdash;though perhaps in a 
lesser degree&mdash;he is as subject to its influences&mdash;its fashions 
and customs&mdash;as they are.  But in this respect his failings may 
be likened to the dross which the purest metal in its molten 
state continually throws up to its surface, but which is mere 
excrement, and so little essential that it can be skimmed away: 
and, as the dross to the metal, just so little essential are the 
archaisms you speak of to the early art, and just so easily can 
they be cast aside.  But bethink you, Kosmon.  Is Hellenic art 
without archaisms?  And that feature of it held to be its 
crowning perfection&mdash;its head&mdash;is not that a very marked one?  
And, is it not so completely opposed to the artist's experience 
in the forms of nature that&mdash;except in subjects from Greek 
history and mythology&mdash;he dares not use it&mdash;at least without 
modifying it so as to destroy its Hellenism? 
 </p></sp><sp>  <speaker>SOPHON.</speaker><p>  Then Hellenic Art is 
like a musical bell with a flaw 
in it; before it can be serviceable it must be broken up and 
recast.  If its sum of beauty&mdash;its line of lines, the facial 
angle, must be destroyed&mdash;as it undoubtedly must,&mdash;before it can 
be used for the general purposes of art, then its claims over 
early mediaeval art, in respect of form, are small indeed.  But 
is it not altogether a great archaism? 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>KALON.</speaker><p>  Oh, Sophon! weighty as 
are the reasons urged against 
Hellenic art by Christian and yourself, they are not weighty 
enough to outbalance its beauty, at least to me:  at present they 
may have set its sun in gloom; yet I know that obscuration, like 
a dark foreground to a bright distance, will make its rising 
again only the more surpassingly glorious.  I admire its 
exquisite creations, because
 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0032" n="166"/> 
  
  they are beautiful, 
and noble, and perfect, and they elevate me because I think them 
so; and their silent capabilities, like the 
star-dust of heaven before the intellectual insight, resolve 
themselves into new worlds of thoughts and things so ever as I 
contemplate their perfections:  like a prolonged music, full of 
sweet yet melancholy cadences, they have sunk into my heart&mdash;my 
brain&mdash;my soul&mdash;never, never to cease while life shall hold with 
me.  But, for all that, my hands are not full; and, whithersoever 
the happy seed shall require me, I am not for withholding plough 
or spade, planting or watering; and that which I am called in the 
spirit to do&mdash;will I do manfully and with my whole strength. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>SOPHON.</speaker><p>  Kalon, the conclusion 
of your speech is better than 
the commencement.  It is better to sacrifice myrrh and 
frankincense than virtue and wisdom, thoughts than deeds.  Would 
that all men were as ready as yourself to dispark their little 
selfish enclosures, and burn out all their hedges of prickly 
briers and brambles&mdash;turning the evil into the good&mdash;the seed-catching into the seed-nourishing.  Of the too consumptions let 
us prefer the active, benevolent, and purifying one of fire, to 
the passive, self-eating, and corrupting one of rust:  one half 
minute's clear shining may touch some watching and waiting soul, 
and through him kindle whole ages of light. 
</p></sp><sp>  <speaker>CHRISTIAN.</speaker><p>  Men do not stumble 
over what they know; and the 
day fades so imperceptibly into night that were it not for 
experience, darkness would surprise us long before we believed 
the day done:  and, in relation to art, its revolutions are still 
more imperceptible in their gradations; and, in fulfilling 
themselves, they spread over such an extent of time, that in 
their knowledge the experience of one artist is next to nothing; 
and its twilight is so lengthy, that those who never saw other, 
believe its gloom to be day; nor are their successors more aware 
that the deepening darkness is the contrary, until night drops 
big like a great clap of thunder, and awakes them staringly to a 
pitiable sense of their condition.  But, if we cannot have this 
experience through ourselves, we can through others; and that 
will show us that Pagan art has once&mdash;nay twice&mdash;already brought 
over Christian art a "darkness which might be felt;" from a 
little handful cloud out of the studio of Squarcione, it gathered 
density and volume through his scholar Mantegna&mdash;made itself a  
nucleus in the Academy of the Medici, and thence it issued in 
such a flood of "heathenesse" that Italy finally became covered 
with one vast deep and thick night of Pagandom.  But in every 
deep there is a lower deep; and, through the same gods-worship, a 
night intenser still fell upon art when the pantomime of 
David


  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0033" n="167"/>

 made its appearance.  With these two 
fearful lessons before his 
eyes, the modern artist can have no other than a settled 
conviction that Pagan art, Devil-like, glozes but to seduce&mdash; 
tempts but to betray; and hence, he chooses to avoid that which 
he believes to be bad, and to follow that which he holds to be 
good, and blots out from his eye and memory all art between the 
present and its first taint of heathenism, and ascends to the art 
previous to Raffaelle; and he ascends thither, not so much for 
its forms as he does for its THOUGHT and NATURE&mdash;the root and 
trunk of the art-tree, of whose numerous branches form is only 
one&mdash;though the most important one:  and he goes to pre-Raffaelle 
art for those two things, because the stream at that point is 
clearer and deeper, and less polluted with animal impurities, 
than at any other in its course.  And, Kalon and Kosmon, had you 
remembered this, and at the same time recollected that the words, 
"Nature" and "Thought" express very peculiar ideas to modern eyes 
and ears&mdash;ideas which are totally unknown to Hellenic Art&mdash;you 
would have instantly felt, that the artist cannot study from it 
things chiefest in importance to him&mdash;of which it is destitute, 
even as is a shore driven boulder of life and verdure.</p></sp>

<head>Modern Giants.</head> 
<p>  Yes! there are Giants on the earth in these days; but it is 
their great bulk, and the nearness of our view, which prevents us 
from perceiving their grandeur.  This is how it is that the glory 
of the present is lost upon the contemporaries of the greatest 
men; and, perhaps this was Swift's meaning, when he said that 
Gulliver could not discover exactly what it was that strode among 
the corn-ridges in the Brobdignagian field: thus, we lose the 
brightness of things of our own time in consequence of their 
proximity.</p> 
<p>  It is of the development of our individual perceptions, and 
the 
application thereof to a good use, that the writer humbly 
endeavours to treat.  We will for this purpose take as an 
example, that which may be held to indicate the civilization of a 
period more than any thing else; namely, the popular perception 
of the essentials of


  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0036" n="170"/>


Poetry; and endeavour to show that while the 
beauties of old 
writers are acknowledged, (tho' not in proportion to the 
attention of each individual in his works to nature alone) the 
modern school is contemned and unconsidered; and also that much 
of the active poetry of modern life is neglected by the majority 
of the writers themselves.</p> 
<p>  There seems to be an opinion gaining ground fast, in spite of 
all the shaking of conventional heads, that the Poets of the 
present day are equal to all others, excepting one: however this 
may be, it is certain we are not fair judges, because of the 
natural reason stated before; and there is decidedly one great 
fault in the moderns, that not only do they study models with 
which they can never become intimately acquainted, but that they 
neglect, or rather reject as worthless, that which they alone can 
carry on with perfect success: I mean the knowledge of 
themselves, and the characteristics of their own actual living.  
Thus, if a modern Poet or Artist (the latter much more culpably 
errs) seeks a subject exemplifying charity, he rambles into 
ancient Greece or Rome, awakening not one half the sympathy in 
the spectator, as do such incidents as may be seen in the streets 
every day.  For instance; walking with a friend the other day, we 
met an old woman, exceedingly dirty, restlessly pattering along 
the kerb of a crowded thoroughfare, trying to cross: her eyes 
were always wandering here and there, and her mouth was never 
still; her object was evident, but for my own part, I must needs 
be fastidious and prefer to allow her to take the risk of being 
run over, to overcoming my own disgust.  Not so my friend; he 
marched up manfully, and putting his arm over the old woman's 
shoulder, led her across as carefully as though she were a 
princess.  Of course, I was ashamed: ashamed! I was frightened; I 
expected to see the old woman change into a tall angel and take 
him off to heaven, leaving me her original shape to repent in.  
On recovering my thoughts, I was inclined to take up my friend 
and carry him home in triumph, I felt so strong.  Why should not 
this thing be as poetical as any in the life of Saint Elizabeth 
of Hungary or any one else?  for, so we look at it with a pure 
thought, we shall see about it the same light the Areopagite saw 
at Jerusalem surround the Holy Virgin, and the same angels 
attending and guarding it.</p> 
<p>  And there is something else we miss; there is the poetry of 
the 
things about us; our railways, factories, mines, roaring cities, 
steam vessels, and the endless novelties and wonders produced 
every day; which if they were found only in the Thousand and One 
Nights, or in any poem classical or romantic, would be gloried 
over without end; for as the majority of us know not a bit more 
about them,


  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0037" n="171"/>


 but merely their names, we keep up the same mystery, 
the main 
thing required for the surprise of the imagination.</p> 
<p>  Next to Poetry, Painting and Music have most power over the 
mind; and how do you apply this influence?  In what direction is 
it forced?  Why, for the last, you sit in your drawing-rooms, and 
listen to a quantity of tinkling of brazen marches of going to 
war; but you never see before your very eyes, the palpable 
victory of leading nature by her own power, to a conquest of 
blessings; and when the music is over, you turn to each other, 
and enthusiastically whisper, "How fine!"&mdash;You point out to 
others, (as if they had no eyes) the sentiment of a flowing river 
with the moon on it, as an emblem of the after-peace, but you see 
not this in the long white cloud of steam, the locomotive pours 
forth under the same moon, rushing on; the perfect type of the 
same, with the presentment of the struggle beforehand.  The 
strong engine is never before you, sighing all night, with the 
white cloud above the chimney-shaft, escaping like the spirits 
Solomon put his seal upon, in the Arabian Tales; these mightier 
spirits are bound in a faster vessel; and then let forth, as of 
little worth, when their work is done.</p> 
<p>  The Earth shakes under you, from the footfall of the Genii man 
has made, and you groan about the noise.  Vast roads draw 
together the Earth, and you say how they spoil the prospect, 
which you never cared a farthing about before.</p> 
<p>  You revel in Geology: but in chemistry, the modern science, 
possessing thousands of powers as great as any used yet, you see 
no glory:&mdash;the only thought is so many Acids and Alkalies.  You 
require a metaphor for treachery, and of course you think of our 
puny old friend the Viper; but the Alkaline, more searching and 
more unknown, that may destroy you and your race, you have never 
heard of,&mdash;and yet this possesses more of the very quality 
required, namely, mystery, than any other that is in your hands.</p> 
<p>  The only ancient character you have retained in its proper 
force is Love; but you seem never to see any light about the 
results of long labour of mind, the most intense Love.  
Devotedness, magnanimity, generosity, you seem to think have left 
the Earth since the Crusades.  In fact, you never go out into 
Life: living only in the past world, you go on repeating in new 
combinations the same elements for the same effect.  You have 
taught an enlightened Public, that the province of Poetry is to 
reproduce the Ancients; not as Keats did, with the living heart 
of our own Life; but so as to cause the impression that you are 
not aware that they had wives and families like yourselves, and 
laboured and rested like us all.</p> 
<p> The greatest, perhaps, of modern poets seeming to take 
refuge

from this, has looked into the heart of man, and shown you its 
pulsations, fears, self-doubts, hates, goodness, devotedness, and 
noble world-love; this is not done under pretty flowers of 
metaphor in the lispings of a pet parson, or in the strong but 
uncertain fashion of the American school; still less in the dry 
operose quackery of professed doctors of psychology, mere chaff 
not studied from nature, and therefore worthless, never felt, and 
therefore useless; but with the firm knowing hand of the 
anatomist, demonstrating and making clear to others, that the 
knowledge may be applied to purpose.  All this difficult task is 
achieved so that you may read till your own soul is before you, 
and you know it; but the enervated public complains that the work 
is obscure forsooth: so we are always looking for green 
grass&mdash;verdant meads, tall pines, vineyards, etc., as the 
essentials of poetry; these are all very pretty and very 
delicate, the dust blows not in your eyes, but Chaucer has told 
us all this, and while it was new, far better than any one else; 
why are we not to have something besides?  Let us see a little of 
the poetry of man's own works,</p> 
<lg type="verse"> 
   <l>"Visibly in his garden walketh God."</l> 
</lg> 
<p>  The great portion of the public take a morbid delight in such 
works as Frankenstein, that "Poor, impossible moster abhorred," 
who would be disgusting if he were not so extremely ludicrous: 
and all this search after impossible mystery, such trumpery! 
growing into the popular taste, is fed with garbage; doing more 
harm than all the preachings and poundings of optimistic Reviews 
will be able to remedy in an hundred years.</p> 
<p>  The study of such matters as these does other harm than merely 
poisoning the mind in one direction; it renders us sceptical of 
virtue in others, and we lose the power of pure perception.  So&mdash; 
reading the glorious tale of Griselda and looking about you, you 
say there never was such a woman; your wise men say she was a 
fool; are there no such fools round about you?  pray look close:--so the result of this is, you see no lesson in such things, or 
at least cannot apply it, and therefore the powers of the author 
are thrown away.  Do you think God made Boccaccio and Chaucer to 
amuse you in your idle hours, only that you might sit listening 
like crowned idiots, and then debate concerning their 
faithfulness to truth?  You never can imagine but they knew more 
of nature than any of us, or that they had less reverence for 
her.</p> 
<p>  In reference to Painting, the Public are taught to look with 
delight upon murky old masters, with dismally demoniac trees, and 
dull

  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0039" n="173"/>
waters of lead, colourless and like ice; upon rocks that make 
geologists wonder, their angles are so impossible, their 
fractures are so new. Thousands are given for uncomfortable Dutch 
sun-lights; but if you are shown a transcript of day itself, with 
the purple shadow upon the mountains, and across the still lake, 
you know nothing of it because your fathers never bought such: so 
you look for nothing in it; nay, let me set you in the actual 
place, let the water damp your feet, stand in the chill of the 
shadow itself, and you will never tell me the colour on the hill, 
or where the last of the crows caught the sinking sunlight.  
Letting observation sleep, what can you know of nature? and you 
<hi rend="italic">are</hi> a judge of landscape indeed.  So it is that the world is 
taught to think of nature, as seen through other men's eyes, 
without any reference to its own original powers of perception, 
and much natural beauty is lost.</p>

  Should weigh upon it, vertical at noon. </l><l> 
  My path lay thro' green open fields at first, </l><l> 
  With now and then trees rising statelily</l><l> 
  Out of the grass; and afterwards came lanes</l><l>

  Peaked by its rooted Castle, like a part</l><l>

  <l>Fragments that lie about, some on the top, </l><l> 
  Some fallen half down on either side the hill, </l><l> 
  Uncared for, well nigh grown into the ground. </l><l> 
  The tower is grey, and brown, and black, with green</l><l> 
  Patches of mildew and of ivy woven</l><l> 
  Over the sightless loopholes and the sides: </l><l>

  The ancient door, cut deep into the wall, </l><l>

  Here was no need of thinking:&mdash;merely sense</l><l>

  And what at first seemed silence, being roused</l><l> 
  By callings of the cuckoo from far off, </l><l>

    Close by his feet he saw it shake</l><l> 
    With wind in pools that the rains make: </l><l> 
    The ripple set his eyes to ache. </l><l> 
  He said, "Calm hath its peace outside." </l> 


  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0043" n="177"/>


<l>He stood within the mystery</l><l> 
    Giving God's blessed Eucharist: </l><l> 
    The organ and the chaunt had ceased: </l><l> 
  A few words paused against his ear, </l><l> 
    Said from the altar: drawn round him, </l><l> 
    The silence was at rest and dim. </l><l> 
  He could not pray.  The bell shook clear</l><l> 
    And ceased.  All was great awe,&mdash;the breath</l><l> 
    Of God in man, that warranteth</l><l> 
    Wholly the inner things of Faith. </l><l> 
  He said: "There is the world outside." </l></lg>

<lg type="verse"> 
<l>"Pride clings to age, for few and withered powers, </l><l> 
  Which fall on youth in pleasures manifold, </l><l> 
Like some bright dancer with a crowd of flowers</l><l> 
  And scented presents more than she can hold: </l></lg> 
<lg type="verse"> 
<l>"Or as it were a child beneath a tree, </l><l>

Beneath the shaken boughs, and eagerly</l><l> 
  Expects the fruit to fall into his lap." </l></lg> 
<lg type="verse"> 
<l>So thought I while my cousin sat alone, </l><l> 
Moving with many leaves in under tone, </l><l> 
And, sheened as snow lit by a pale moonlight,</l><l> 
Her childish dress struck clearly on the sight: </l><l> 
That, as the lilies growing by her side</l><l> 
Casting their silver radiance forth with pride, </l><l> 
She seemed to dart an arrowy halo round, </l><l> 
Brightening the spring time tress, brightening the ground; </l><l> 
And beauty, like keen lustre from a star, </l><l> 
Glorified all the garden near and far. </l><l> 
The sunlight smote the grey and mossy wall</l><l> 
Where, 'mid the leaves, the peaches one and all, </l><l> 
Most like twin cherubim entranced above, </l><l> 
Leaned their soft cheeks together, pressed in love. </l> 
 

  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0044" n="178"/> 


<l>As the child sat, the tendrils shook round her; </l><l> 
And, blended tenderly in middle air, </l><l> 
Gleamed the long orchard through the ivied gate: </l><l> 
And slanting sunbeams made the heart elate, </l><l> 
Startling it into gladness like the sound, </l><l> 
Which echo childlike mimicks faintly round</l><l> 
Blending it with the lull of some far flood, </l><l> 
Of one long shout heard in a quiet wood. </l><l> 
A gurgling laugh far off the fountain sent, </l><l> 
As if the mermaid shape that in it bent</l><l> 
Spoke with subdued and faintest melody: </l><l> 
And birds sang their whole hearts spontaneously. </l></lg> 
<lg type="verse"> 
<l>When from your books released, pass here your hours, </l><l> 
Dear child, the sweet companion of these flowers, </l><l> 
These poplars, scented shrubs, and blossomed boughs</l><l> 
Of fruit-trees, where the noisy sparrows house, </l><l> 
Shaking from off the leaves the beaded dew. </l><l> 
Now while the air is warm, the heavens blue, </l><l> 
Give full abandonment to all your gay</l><l> 
Swift childlike impulses in rompish play; </l><l> 
The while your sisters in shrill laughter shout, </l><l> 
Whirling above the leaves and round about, </l><l> 
Until at length it drops behind the wall, </l><l> 
With awkward jerks, the particoloured ball: </l><l> 
Winning a smile even from the stooping age</l><l> 
Of that old matron leaning on her page, </l><l> 
Who in the orchard takes a stroll or two, </l><l> 
Watching you closely yet unseen by you. </l></lg> 
<lg type="verse"><l>Then, tired of gambols, turn into the dark</l><l> 
Fir-skirted margins of your father's park; </l><l> 
And watch the moving shadows, as you pass, </l><l> 
Trace their dim network on the tufted grass, </l><l> 
And how on birch-trunks smooth and branches old, </l><l> 
The velvet moss bursts out in green and gold, </l><l> 
Like the rich lustre full and manifold</l><l> 
On breasts of birds that star the curtained gloom</l><l> 
From their glass cases in the drawing room. </l><l> 
Mark the spring leafage bend its tender spray</l><l> 
Gracefully on the sky's aerial grey; </l><l> 
And listen how the birds so voluble</l><l> 
Sing joyful paeans winding to a swell, </l> 


  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0045" n="179"/>


<l>And how the wind, fitful and mournful, grieves</l><l> 
In gusty whirls among the dry red leaves; </l><l> 
And watch the minnows in the water cool, </l><l> 
And floating insects wrinkling all the pool. </l></lg> 
 
<lg type="verse"><l>So in your ramblings bend your earnest eyes. </l><l> 
  High thoughts and feelings will come unto you, </l><l> 
  Gladness will fall upon your heart like dew, </l><l> 
Because you love the earth and love the skies.</l></lg> 
<lg type="verse"> 
<l>Fair pearl, the pride of all our family: </l><l>

Mary and Martha with bowed faces kept</l><l>

<l>A remote sky, prolonged to the sea's brim: </l><l> 
  One rock-point standing buffetted alone, </l><l> 
  Vexed at its base with a foul beast unknown, </l><l> 
Hell-spurge of geomaunt and teraphim: </l><l> 
A knight, and a winged creature bearing him, </l><l> 
  Reared at the rock: a woman fettered there, </l><l> 
  Leaning into the hollow with loose hair</l><l> 
And throat let back and heartsick trail of limb. </l><l> 
The sky is harsh, and sea shrewd and salt. </l><l> 
  Under his lord, the griffin-horse ramps blind</l><l> 
    With rigid wings and tail.  The spear's lithe stem</l><l> 
  Thrills in the roaring of those jaws: behind, </l><l>

<p>  There are occasions when the office of the critic becomes 
almost simply that of an expositor; when his duty is not to 
assert, but to interpret.  It is his privilege to have been the 
first to study a subject, and become familiar with it; what 
remains is to state facts, and to suggest considerations; not to 
lay down dogmas.  That which he speaks of is to him itself a 
dogma; he starts from conviction: his it is to convince others, 
and, as far as may be, by the same means as satisfied himself; to 
incite to the same study, doing his poor best, meanwhile, to supply 
the present want of it.</p> 
<p>  Thus much, indeed, is the critic's duty always; but he 
generally feels the right, and has it, of speaking with authority.  
He condemns, 
or gives praise; and his judgment, though merely individual and 
subject to 
revision, is judgment.  Before the certainty of genius and 
deathless power, 
in the contemplation of consummate art, his position changes: and 
well 
for him if he knows, and is contented it should be so.  Here he 
must follow, 
happy if he only follows and serves; and while even here he will 
not 
shelve his doubts, or blindly refuse to exercise a candid 
discrimination, 
his demur at unquestioning assent, far from betraying any 
arrogance, will be 
discreetly advanced, and on clearly stated grounds.</p> 
<p>  Of all poets, there is none more than Robert Browning, in 
approaching whom diffidence is necessary.  The mere extent of his 
information 
cannot pass unobserved, either as a fact, or as a title to respect.  
No 
one who has read the body of his works will deny that they are 
replete 
with mental and speculative subtlety, with vivid and most 
diversified 
conception of character, with dramatic incident and feeling; with 
that intimate 
knowledge of outward nature which makes every sentence of 
description a 
living truth; replete with a most human tenderness and pathos.  
Common as is 
the accusation of "extravagance," and unhesitatingly as it is 
applied, in a general off-hand style, to the entire character of 
Browning's 
poems, it would require some jesuitism of self-persuasion to induce 
any one 
to affirm his belief in the existence of such extravagance in the 
conception of the poems, or in the sentiments expressed; of any 
want of 
concentration in thought, of national or historical keeping.  far 
from this, 
indeed, a deliberate unity of purpose is strikingly apparent.  
Without 
referring for the present
 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0054" n="188"/>
  to what are assumed to be perverse faults 
of execution&mdash;a 
question the principles and bearing of which will shortly be 
considered&mdash;assuredly the mention of the names of a few among 
Browning's poems&mdash;of "Paracelsus," "Pippa Passes," "Luria," the 
"Souls's Tragedy," "King Victor and King Charles," even of the less 
perfect achievement," "Strafford"; or, 
passing to the smaller poems, of "The Soliloquy of the Spanish 
Cloister," 
"The Laboratory," and "The Bishop orders his Tomb at St. 
Praxed's";&mdash;will at once realize to the memory of all readers an 
abstruse ideal never lostsight of, and treated to the extreme of 
elaboration.  As regards 
this point, we address all in any manner acquainted with the poet's 
works, certain of receiving an affirmative answer even from those 
who 
"can't read Sordello, or understand the object of writing in that 
style."</p> 
<p>   If so many exceptions to Browning's "system of extravagance" 
be admitted,&mdash;and we again refer for confirmation or refutation t 
all who have sincerely read him, and who, valuing written criticism 
at its 
worth, value also at <hi rend="italic">its</hi> worth the criticism of individual 
conviction,&mdash;wherein are we to seek this extravagance?  The ground 
work exempted, the imputation attaches, if anywhere, to the 
framework; to the body, if not to the soul. And we are thus left to 
consider the style, or mode of 
expression.</p> 
<p>   Style is not stationary, or, <hi rend="italic">in the concrete</hi>, matter 
of 
principle: style is, firstly, national; next, chronological; and 
lastly, individual.  To try the oriental system by the European, 
and 
pronounce either wrong by so much as it exceeds or falls short, 
would imply 
so entire a want of comprehensive appreciation as can scarcely fail 
to 
induce the conviction, that the two are distinct and independent, 
each to be 
tested on its own merits.  Again, were the Elizabethan dramatists 
right, or 
are those our own day?  Neither absolutely, as by comparison alone; 
his 
period speaks in each; and each must be judged by this: not whether 
he is true 
to any given type, but whether his own type be a true one for 
himself.  
And this, which holds good between nations and ages, holds good 
also 
between individuals.  Very different from Shelley's are 
Wordsworth's 
nature in description, his sentiment, his love; Burn's and Keats's 
different from these and from each other: yet are all these, 
nature, and 
sentiment, and love.</p> 
<p>  But here it will be urged: by this process any and every style 
is pronounced good, so that it but find a measure of recognition in 
its own age and country; nay, even the author's self-approval will 
be 
sufficient. And, as a corollary, each age must and ought to reject 
its 
predecessor; and Voltaire was no less than right in dubbing 

  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0055" n="189"/>
  
  Shakspere barbarian.  That it is not so, however, will appear when 
the last 
element of truth in style, that with which all others combine, 
which 
includes and implies consistency with the author's self, with his 
age and 
his country, is taken into account.  Appropriateness of treatment 
to 
subject it is which lies at the root of all controversy on style: 
that is 
the last and the whole test.  And the fact that none other is 
requisite, 
or, more strictly, that all others are but aspects of this one, 
will very 
easily be allowed when it is reflected that the subject, to be of 
an 
earnest and sincere ideal, must be an emanation of the poet's most 
secret 
soul; and that the soul receives teaching from circumstance, which 
is the 
time when and place where.</p> 
<p>  This promised, it must next be borne in mind that the poet's 
conception 
of his subject is not identical with, and, in the majority of 
cases, will 
be unlike, his reader's.  And, the question of style (manner) being 
necessarily subordinate to that of subject (matter), it is not for 
the 
reader to dispute with the author on his mode of rendering, 
provided that 
should be accepted as embodying (within the bounds of grammatical 
logic) 
the intention preconceived.  The object of the poet in writing, why 
he 
attempts to describe an event as resulting from this cause or this, 
or why 
he assumes such as the effect; all these considerations the reader 
is 
competent to entertain: any two men may deduce from the same 
premises, and 
may probably arrive at different conclusions: but, these 
conclusions 
reached, what remains is a question of resemblance, which each must 
determine for himself, as best conscious of his own intention. To 
take an 
instance.  Shakspere's conception of Macbeth as a man capable of  
uttering a pompous conceit&mdash;</p> 
<lg type="verse"> 
<l>("Here lay Duncan,</l> 
  <l>His silver skin laced with his golden blood&mdash;")</l></lg> 
<p>in a moment, to him, and to all present, of startling purport, 
may be a correct or an impressive conception, or it may be the 
reverse. That the rendering of the momentary intention is adequate 
here there is no reason to doubt.  If so, in what respect is the 
reader called upon to 
investigate a matter of style?  He must simply return to the 
question of 
whether this point of character be consistent with others imagined 
of the same 
person; this, answered affirmatively, is an approval,&mdash;negatively, 
a 
condemnation, of <hi rend="italic">intention</hi>; the merit of <hi rend="italic">style</hi>, in 
either case, 
being mere competence, and that admitted irrespectively of the 
reader's 
liking or disliking of the passage <hi rend="italic">per se</hi>, or as part of a 
context.  
Why, in this same tragedy of Macbeth, is a drunken porter 
introduced 
between a murder and its discovery?  Did Shakspere really intend 
him to be 
a sharp-witted
 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0056" n="190"/>
  
  man?  These questions are pertinent and necessary.  
There is no 
room for disputing that this scene is purposely a comic scene: and, 
if 
this is certain, the style of the speech is appropriate to the 
scene, and 
of the scene, to the conception of the drama?  Is <hi rend="italic">that 
conception</hi> 
admirable?</p> 
<p>  We have entered thus at length on the investigation of 
adequacy and 
appropriateness of style, and of the mode by which entire classes 
of 
disputable points, usually judged under that name, may be reduced 
to the more essential element of conception; because it will be 
almost 
invariably found, that a mere arbitrary standard of irresponsible 
private 
predilection is then resorted to.  Nor can this be well guarded 
against.  The 
concrete, <hi rend="italic">style</hi>, being assumed as always constituting an 
entity 
auxiliary to, but not of necessity modified by, and representing 
subject,&mdash;as 
something substantially pre-existing in the author's mind or 
practice, and 
belonging to him individually; the reader will, not without show of 
reason, 
betake himself to the trial of personality by personality, 
another's by 
his own; and will thus pronounce on poems or passages of poems not 
as 
elevated, or vigorous, or well-sustained, or the opposite, in idea, 
but, 
according to certain notions of his own, as attractive, original, 
or 
conventional writing.</p> 
<p>  Thus far as regards those parts of execution which concern 
human<ref target="rev1" n="1">*</ref> embodiment&mdash;the metaphysical and 
dramatic or epic faculties.  Of style in description the reader is 
more nearly as 
competent a judge as the writer.  In the one case, the poet is 
bound to 
realize an idea, which is his own, and the justness of which, and 
therefore 
of the form of its expression, can be decided only by reasoning and 
analogy; in the other, having for his type material phaenomena, 
he must 
reproduce the things as cognizable by all, though not hereby in any 
way exempt 
from adhering absolutely to his proper perception of them.  Here, 
even 
as to ideal description or simile, the reader can assert its truth 
or 
falsehood of purpose, its sufficiency or insufficiency of means: 
but here 
again he must beware of exceeding his rights, and of substituting 
himself 
to his author.  He must not dictate under what aspect nature is to 
be 
considered, stigmatizing the one chosen, because his own bent is 
rather 
towards some other.  In the exercise of censure, he cannot fairly 
allow any 
personal <hi rend="italic">peculiarities</hi> of view to influence him; but will 
have to 
decide from common grounds of perception, unless clearly conscious 
of
  
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0057" n="191"/>
  
  short-coming, or of the extreme of any corresponding peculiarity on 
the author's part.</p> 
<p>  In speaking of the adaptation of style to conception, we 
advanced that, 
details of character and of action being a portion of the latter, 
the real 
point to determine in reference to the former is, whether such 
details are 
completely rendered in relation to the general purpose.  And here, 
to 
return to Robert Browning, we would enforce on the attention of 
those among 
his readers who assume that he spoils fine thoughts by a vicious, 
extravagant, and involved style, a few analytical questions, to be 
answered 
unbiassed by hearsay evidence.  Concerning the dramatic works: Is 
the 
leading idea conspicuously brought forward throughout each work? Is 
the 
language of the several speakers such as does not create any 
impression 
other than warranted by the subject matter of each?  If so, does it 
create 
the impression apparently intended?  Is the character of speech 
varied 
according to that of the speaker?  Are the passages of description 
and 
abstract reflection so introduced as to add to poetic, without 
detracting 
from dramatic, excellence?  About the narrative poems, and those of 
a more 
occasional and personal quality the same questions may be asked 
with some 
obvious adaptation; and this about all: Are the versification 
strong, the 
sound sharp or soft, monotonous, hurried, in proportion to the 
requirement 
of sense; the illustrative thoughts apt and new; the humour quaint 
and 
relishing?  Finally, is not in many cases that which is spoken  of 
as 
something extraneous, dragged in aforethought, for the purpose of 
singularity, the result more truly of a most earnest and 
single-minded labor after the utmost rendering of idiomatic 
conversational truth; the rejection of all stop-gap words; about 
the most literal transcript of fact compatible with the ends of 
poetry and true feeling for Art? This a point worthy note, and not 
capable of contradiction.<ref target="rev2" n="2">**</ref></p> 
<p>  These questions answered categorically will, we believe, be 
found to 
establish the assurance that Browning's style is copious, and 
certainly not 
other than appropriate, instance contrasted with instance&mdash;as the 
form of 
expression bestowed on the several phases of certain ever-present 
form of 
thought.  We have already endeavored to show that, where style is 
not 
inadequate, its object as a means being attained, the mind must 
revert to its decision as to relative and collective value of 
intention: and we will again leave
  
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002625_0058" n="192"/>
  Browning's manifestations of intellectual purpose, as such, for the 
verdict 
of his reader.</p> 
<p>  To those who yet insist: "Why cannot I read Sordello?" we can 
only answer:&mdash;Admitted a leading idea, not only metaphysical but 
subtle and complicated to the highest degree; how work out this 
idea, unless 
through the finest intricacy of shades of mental development?  
Admitted a 
philosophic comprehensiveness of historical estimate and a 
minuteness of 
familiarity with details, with the added assumption, besides, of 
speaking 
with the very voice of the times; how present this position, unless 
by 
standing at an eminent point, and addressing thence a not 
unprepared 
audience?  Admitted an intense arching concentration of thought; 
how be 
self-consistent, unless uttering words condensed to the limits of 
language?&mdash;And let us at last say: Read Sordello again.  Why hold 
firm that you ought to be able at once to know Browning's stops, 
and to pluck out the heart of his mystery?  Surely, if you do not 
understand him, the fact tells two ways.  But, if you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> 
understand him, you shall.</p> 
<p>  We have been desirous to explain and justify the state of 
feeling in which we enter on the consideration of a new poem by 
Robert Browning. Those who already feel with us will scarcely be 
disposed to forgive the prolixity which, for the present, has put 
it out of our power to come at the work itself: but, if earnestness 
of intention will plead our excuse, we need seek for no other.</p> 
 
<note id="rev1" n="1"><p>In employing the word "human," we would have our

Art and Poetry,<lb/> 
Being Thoughts towards Nature.</head> 

<p>Conducted principally by Artists.</p> 
 
<p>OF the little worthy the name of writing that has ever been 
written upon 
the principles of Art, (of course excepting that on the mere 
mechanism), a 
very small portion is by Artists themselves; and that is so 
scattered, that 
one scarcely knows where to find the ideas of an Artist except in 
his pictures.</p> 
<p>  With a view to obtain the thoughts of Artists, upon Nature as 
evolved in Art, in another language besides their <hi rend="italic">own proper</hi> 
one, 
this Periodical has been established.  Thus, then, it is not open 
to the 
conflicting opinions of all who handle the brush and palette, nor 
is it 
restricted to actual practitioners; but is intended to enunciate 
the principles of those who, in the true spirit of Art, enforce a 
rigid adherence to the simplicity of Nature either in Art or 
Poetry, and consequently regardless whether emanating from 
practical Artists, or from those who have studied nature in the 
Artists School.</p> 
<p>  Hence this work will contain such original Tales (in prose or 
verse), 
Poems, Essays, and the like, as may seem conceived in the spirit, 
or with 
the intent, of exhibiting a pure and unaffected style, to which 
purpose analytical Reviews of current Literature&mdash;especially 
Poetry&mdash;will be introduced; as also illustrative Etchings, one of 
which latter, executed with the utmost care and completeness, will 
appear in each number.</p>
