                <p>H. R. H. the Princess Aline of Hohenwald came into the life of Morton Carlton
                    &mdash; or "Morney" Carlton, as men called him &mdash; of New York city,
                    when that young gentleman's affairs and affections were best suited to receive
                    her. Had she made her appearance three years sooner or three years later, it is
                    quite probable that she would have passed on out of his life with no more
                    recognition from him than would have been expressed in a look of admiring
                    curiosity.</p>
                <p>But coming when she did, when his time and heart were both unoccupied, she had an
                    influence upon young Mr. Carlton which led him into doing several wise and many
                    foolish <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0019" n="2"/> things, and which remained with
                    him always. Carlton had reached a point in his life, and very early in his life,
                    when he could afford to sit at ease and look back with modest satisfaction to
                    what he had forced himself to do, and forward with pleasurable anticipations to
                    whatsoever he might choose to do in the future. The world had appreciated what
                    he had done, and had put much to his credit, and he was prepared to draw upon
                    this grandly.</p>
                <p>At the age of twenty he had found himself his own master, with excellent family
                    connections, but with no family, his only relative being a bachelor uncle, who
                    looked at life from the point of view of the Union Club's windows, and who
                    objected to his nephew's leaving Harvard to take up the study of art in Paris.
                    In that city (where at Julian's he was nicknamed the junior Carlton, for the
                    obvious reason that he was the older of the two Carltons in the class, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0020" n="3"/> and because he was well dressed) he had
                    shown himself a harder worker than others who were less careful of their
                    appearance and of their manners. His work, of which he did not talk, and his
                    ambitions, of which he also did not talk, bore fruit early, and at twenty-six he
                    had become a portrait-painter of international reputation. Then the French
                    government purchased one of his paintings at an absurdly small figure, and
                    placed it in the Luxembourg, from whence it would in time depart to be buried in
                    the hall of some provincial city; and American millionaires, and English Lord
                    Mayors, members of Parliament, and members of the Institute, masters of hounds
                    in pink coats, and ambassadors in gold lace, and beautiful women of all
                    nationalities and conditions sat before his easel. And so when he returned to
                    New York he was welcomed with an enthusiasm which showed that his countrymen had
                    feared that <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0021" n="4"/> atmosphere of the Old World
                    had stolen him from them forever. He was particularly silent, even at this date,
                    about his work, and listened to what others had to say of it with much awe, not
                    unmixed with some amusement, that it should be he who was capable of producing
                    anything worthy of such praise. We have been told what the mother duck felt when
                    her ugly duckling turned into a swan, but we have never considered how much the
                    ugly duckling must have marvelled also.</p>
                <p>"Carlton is probably the only living artist," a brother artist had said of him,
                    "who fails to appreciate how great his work is." And on this being repeated to
                    Carlton by a good-natured friend, he had replied cheerfully, "Well, I'm sorry,
                    but it is certainly better to be the only one who doesn't appreciate it than to
                    be the only one who does."</p>
                <p>He had never understood why such a <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0022" n="5"/>
                    responsibility had been intrusted to him. It was, as he expressed it, not at all
                    in his line, and young girls who sought to sit at the feet of the master found
                    him making love to them in the most charming manner in the world, as though he
                    were not entitled to all the rapturous admiration of their very young hearts,
                    but had to sue for it like any ordinary mortal. Carlton always felt as though
                    some day some one would surely come along and say: "Look here, young man, this
                    talent doesn't belong to you; it's mine. What do you mean by pretending that
                    such an idle good-natured youth as yourself is entitled to such a gift of
                    genius?" He felt that he was keeping it in trust, as it were; that it had been
                    changed at birth, and that the proper guardian would eventually relieve him of
                    his treasure.</p>
                <p>Personally Carlton was of the opinion that he should have been born in the active
                    days of knights-errant &mdash; to have had nothing more <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0023" n="6"/> serious to do than to ride abroad with
                    a blue ribbon fastened to the point of his lance, and with the spirit to unhorse
                    any one who objected to its color, or to the claims of superiority of the noble
                    lady who had tied it there. There was not, in his opinion, at the present day
                    any sufficiently pronounced method of declaring admiration for the many lovely
                    women this world contained. A proposal of marriage he considered to be a mean
                    and clumsy substitute for the older way, and was uncomplimentary to the many
                    other women left unasked, and marriage itself required much more constancy than
                    he could give. He had a most romantic and old-fashioned ideal of women as a
                    class, and from the age of fourteen had been a devotee of hundreds of them as
                    individuals; and though in that time his ideal had received several severe
                    shocks, he still believed that the "not impossible she" existed somewhere, and
                    his conscientious efforts to <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0024" n="7"/> find out
                    whether every women he met might not be that one had led him not unnaturally
                    into many difficulties.</p>
                <p>"The trouble with me is," he said, "that I care too much to make Platonic
                    friendship possible, and don't care enough to marry any particular woman
                    &mdash; that is, of course, supposing that any particular one would be so
                    little particular as to be willing to marry me. How embarrassing it would be,
                    now," he argued, "if, when you were turning away from the chancel after the
                    ceremony, you should look at one of the bridesmaids and see the woman whom you
                    really should have married! How distressing that would be! You couldn't very
                    well stop and say: `I am very sorry, my dear, but it seems I have made a
                    mistake. That young woman on the right has a most interesting and beautiful
                    face. I am very much afraid that she is the one.' It would be too late then;
                    while now, in my free state, I can continue <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0025"
                        n="8"/> my, search without any sense of responsibility."</p>
                <p>"Why" &mdash; he would exclaim &mdash; "I have walked miles to get a
                    glimpse of a beautiful woman in a suburban window, and time and time again when
                    I have seen a face in a passing brougham I have pursued it in a hansom, and
                    learned where the owner of the face lived, and spent weeks in finding some one
                    to present me, only to discover that she was self-conscious or uninteresting or
                    engaged. Still I had assured myself that she was not the one. I am very
                    conscientious, and I consider that it is my duty to go so far with every woman I
                    meet as to be able to learn whether she is or is not the one, and the sad result
                    is that I am like a man who follows the hounds but is never in at the death."</p>
                <p>"Well," some married woman would say, grimly, "I hope you will get your deserts
                    some day; and you <hi rend="italic">will</hi>, too. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0026" n="9"/> Some day some girl will make you suffer
                    for this."</p>
                <p>"Oh, that's all right," Carlton would answer, meekly. "Lots of women have made me
                    suffer, if that's what you think I need."</p>
                <p>"Some day," the married woman would prophesy, "you will care for a woman so much
                    that you will have no eyes for any one else. That's the way it is when one is
                    married."</p>
                <p>"Well, when that's the way it is with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>," Carlton would
                    reply, "I certainly hope to get married; but until it is, I think it is safer
                    for all concerned that I should not."</p>
                <p>Then Carlton would go to the club and complain bitterly to one of his friends.</p>
                <p>"How unfair married women are!" he would say. "The idea of thinking a man could
                    have no eyes but for one woman! Suppose I had never heard a note of music until
                    I was twenty-five years of age, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0027" n="10"/>
                    was then given my hearing. Do you suppose my pleasure in music would make me
                    lose my pleasure in everything else? Suppose I met and married a girl at
                    twenty-five. Is that going to make me forget all the women I knew before I met
                    her? I think not. As a matter of fact, I really deserve a great deal of credit
                    for remaining single, for I am naturally very affectionate; but when I see what
                    poor husbands my friends make, I prefer to stay as I am until I am sure that I
                    will make a better one. It is only fair to the woman."</p>
                <p>Carlton was sitting in the club alone. He had that sense of superiority over his
                    fellows and of irresponsibility to the world about him that comes to a man when
                    he knows that his trunks are being packed and that his state-room is engaged. He
                    was leaving New York long before most of his friends could get away. He did not
                    know just where he was going, and preferred not to <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0028" n="11"/> know. He wished to have a complete
                    holiday, and to see Europe as an idle tourist, and not as an artist with an eye
                    to his own improvement. He had plenty of time and money; he was sure to run
                    across friends in the big cities, and acquaintances he could make or not, as he
                    pleased, <hi rend="italic">en route</hi>. He was not sorry to go. His going
                    would serve to put an end to what gossip there might be of his engagement to
                    numerous young women whose admiration for him as an artist, he was beginning to
                    fear, had taken on a more personal tinge. "I wish," he said, gloomily, "I didn't
                    like people so well. It seems to cause them and me such a lot of trouble."</p>
                <p>He sighed, and stretched out his hand for a copy of one of the English
                    illustrated papers. It had a fresher interest to him because the next number of
                    it that he would see would be in the city in which it was printed. The paper in
                    his hands was the <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0029" n="12"/>
                    <hi rend="italic">St. James Budget</hi>, and it contained much fashionable
                    intelligence concerning the preparations for a royal wedding which was soon to
                    take place between members of two of the reigning families of Europe. There was
                    on one page a half-tone reproduction of a photograph, which showed a group of
                    young people belonging to several of these reigning families, with their names
                    and titles printed above and below the picture. They were princesses, archdukes,
                    or grand-dukes, and they were dressed like young English men and women, and with
                    no sign about them of their possible military or social rank.</p>
                <p>One of the young princesses in the photograph was looking out of it and smiling
                    in a tolerant, amused way, as though she had thought of something which she
                    could not wait to enjoy until after the picture was taken. She was not posing
                    consciously, as were some of the others, but was sitting in a natural attitude,
                    with one arm over the <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0030" n="13"/> back of her
                    chair, and with her hands clasped before her. Her face was full of a fine
                    intelligence and humor, and though one of the other princesses in the group was
                    far more beautiful, this particular one had a much more high-bred air, and there
                    was something of a challenge in her smile that made any one who looked at the
                    picture smile also. Carlton studied the face for some time, and mentally
                    approved of its beauty; the others seemed in comparison wooden and unindividual,
                    but this one looked like a person he might have known, and whom he would
                    certainly have liked. He turned the page and surveyed the features of the Oxford
                    crew with lesser interest, and then turned the page again and gazed critically
                    and severely at the face of the princess with the high-bred smile. He had hoped
                    that he would find it less interesting at a second glance, but it did not prove
                    to be so.</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0031" n="14"/>
                <p>"`The Princess Aline of Hohenwald,'" he read. "She's probably engaged to one of
                    those Johnnies beside her, and the Grand-Duke of Hohenwald behind her must be
                    her brother." He put the paper down and went into luncheon, and diverted himself
                    by mixing a salad dressing; but after a few moments he stopped in the midst of
                    this employment, and told the waiter, with some unnecessary sharpness, to bring
                    him the last copy of the <hi rend="italic">St. James Budget</hi>.</p>
                <p>"Confound it!" he added, to himself.</p>
                <p>He opened the paper with a touch of impatience and gazed long and earnestly at
                    the face of the Princess Aline, who continued to return his look with the same
                    smile of amused tolerance. Carlton noted every detail of her tailor-made gown,
                    of her high mannish collar, of her tie, and even the rings on her hand. There
                    was nothing about her of which he could fairly disapprove. He wondered why it
                    was that she could not <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0032" n="15"/> have been born
                    an approachable New York girl instead of a princess of a little German duchy,
                    hedged in throughout her single life, and to be traded off eventually in
                    marriage with as much consideration as though she were a princess of a real
                    kingdom.</p>
                <p>"She looks jolly too," he mused, in an injured tone; "and so very clever; and of
                    course she has a beautiful complexion. All those German girls have. Your Royal
                    Highness is more than pretty," he said, bowing his head gravely. "You look as a
                    princess should look. I am sure it was one of your ancestors who discovered the
                    dried pea under a dozen mattresses." He closed the paper, and sat for a moment
                    with a perplexed smile of consideration. "Waiter," he exclaimed, suddenly, "send
                    a messenger-boy to Brentano's for a copy of the <hi rend="italic">St. James
                        Budget</hi>, and bring me the Almanach de Gotha from the library. It is a
                    little fat red book on the table near the window." <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0033" n="16"/> Then Carlton opened the paper again
                    and propped it up against a carafe, and continued his critical survey of the
                    Princess Aline. He seized the Almanach, when it came, with some eagerness.</p>
                <p>"Hohenwald (Maison de Grasse)," he read, and in small type below it: </p>
                <p>"1. Ligne cadette (r&eacute;gnante) grand-ducale: Hohenwald et de Grasse.</p>
                <p>"Guillaume-Albert-Frederick-Charles-Louis, Grand-Duc de Hohenwald et de Grasse,
                    etc., etc., etc." </p>
                <p>"That's the brother, right enough," muttered Carlton.</p>
                <p>And under the heading "S&oelig;urs" he read: </p>
                <p>"4. <hi rend="italic">Psse Aline</hi>. &mdash;
                    Victoria-Beatrix-Louise-Helene, Alt. Gr.-Duc. Ne&eacute; &agrave;
                    Grasse, Juin, 1872." </p>
                <p>"Twenty-two years old," exclaimed Carlton. "What a perfect age! I could not have
                    invented a better one." He looked from the <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0034"
                        n="17"/> book to the face before him. "Now, my dear young lady," he said, "I
                    know all about <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. You live at Grasse, and you are
                    connected, to judge by your names, with all the English royalties; and very
                    pretty names they are, too &mdash; Aline, Helene, Victoria, Beatrix. You
                    must be much more English than you are German; and I suppose you live in a
                    little old castle, and your brother has a standing army of twelve men, and some
                    day you are to marry a Russian Grand-Duke, or whoever your brother's Prime
                    Minister if he has a Prime Minister-decides is best for the politics of your
                    little toy kingdom. Ah! to think," exclaimed Carlton, softly, "that such a
                    lovely and glorious creature as that should be sacrificed for so insignificant a
                    thing as the peace of Europe when she might make some young man happy?"</p>
                <p>He carried a copy of the paper to his room, and cut the picture of the group out
                    of the page and pasted it carefully on a stiff <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0035"
                        n="18"/> piece of card-board. Then he placed it on his dressing-table, in
                    front of a photograph of a young woman in a large silver frame-which was a sign,
                    had the young woman but known it, that her reign for the time being was over.</p>
                <p>Nolan, the young Irishman who "did for" Carlton, knew better than to move it when
                    he found it there. He had learned to study his master since he had joined him in
                    London, and understood that one photograph in the silver frame was entitled to
                    more consideration than three others on the writing-desk or half a dozen on the
                    mantel-piece. Nolan had seen them come and go; he had watched them rise and
                    fall; he had carried notes to them, and books and flowers; and had helped to
                    dispose them from the silver frame and move them on by degrees down the line,
                    until they went ingloriously into the big brass bowl on the side table. Nolan
                    approved highly of this last choice. <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0036"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0037"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0038" n="19"/> He did not know which one of the three
                    in the group it might be; but they were all pretty, and their social standing
                    was certainly distinguished.</p>
                <p>Guido, the Italian model who ruled over the studio, and Nolan were busily packing
                    when Carlton entered. He always said that Guido represented him in his
                    professional and Nolan in his social capacity. Guido cleaned the brushes and
                    purchased the artists' materials; Nolan cleaned his riding-boots and bought his
                    theatre and railroad tickets.</p>
                <p>"Guido," said Carlton, "there are two sketches I made in Germany last year, one
                    of the Prime Minister, and one of Ludwig the actor; get them out for me, will
                    you, and pack them for shipping. Nolan," he went on, "here is a telegram to
                    send."</p>
                <p>Nolan would not have read a letter, but he looked upon telegrams as public
                    documents, the reading of them as part of his <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0039"

                    Secretary, German Embassy, Washington, D.C., and the message read: </p>
                <p>"Please telegraph me full title and address Princess Aline of Hohenwald. Where
                    would a letter reach her?<lb/> "MORTON CARLTON."</p>

                <p>The next morning Nolan carried to the express office a box containing two
                    oil-paintings on small canvases. They were addressed to the man in London who
                    attended to the shipping and forwarding of Carlton's pictures in that town. </p>
                <p>There was a tremendous crowd on the <hi rend="italic">New York</hi>. She sailed
                    at the obliging hour of eleven in the morning, and many people, in consequence,
                    whose affection would not have stood in the way of their breakfast, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0040" n="21"/> made it a point to appear and to say
                    goodbye. Carlton, for his part, did not notice them; he knew by experience that
                    the attractive-looking people always leave a steamer when the whistle blows, and
                    that the next most attractive-looking, who remain on board, are ill all the way
                    over. A man that he knew seized him by the arm as he was entering his cabin, and
                    asked if he were crossing or just seeing people off.</p>
                <p>"Well, then, I want to introduce you to Miss Morris and her aunt, Mrs. Downs;
                    they are going over, and I should be glad if you would be nice to them. But you
                    know her, I guess?" he asked, over his shoulder, as Carlton pushed his way after
                    him down the deck.</p>
                <p>"I know who she is," he said.</p>
                <p>Miss Edith Morris was surrounded by a treble circle of admiring friends, and
                    seemed to be holding her own. They all stopped when Carlton came up, and looked
                    at him <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0041" n="22"/> rather closely, and those whom
                    he knew seemed to mark the fact by a particularly hearty greeting. The man who
                    had brought him up acted as though he had successfully accomplished a somewhat
                    difficult and creditable feat. Carlton bowed himself away, leaving Miss Morris
                    to her friends, and saying that she would probably have to see him later,
                    whether she wished it or not. He then went to meet the aunt, who received him
                    kindly, for there were very few people on the passenger list, and she was glad
                    they were to have his company. Before he left she introduced him to a young man
                    named Abbey, who was hovering around her most anxiously, and whose interest, she
                    seemed to think it necessary to explain, was due to the fact that he was engaged
                    to Miss Morris. Mr. Abbey left the steamer when the whistle blew, and Carlton
                    looked after him gratefully. He always enjoyed meeting attractive <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0042" n="23"/> girls who were engaged, as it left him
                    no choice in the matter, and excused him from finding out whether or not that
                    particular young woman was the one.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Downs and her niece proved to be experienced sailors, and faced the heavy
                    sea that met the <hi rend="italic">New York</hi> outside of Sandy Hook with
                    unconcern. Carlton joined them, and they stood together leaning with their backs
                    to the rail, and trying to fit the people who flitted past them to the names on
                    the passenger list.</p>
                <p>"The young lady in the sailor suit," said Miss Morris, gazing at the top of the
                    smoke-stack, "is Miss Kitty Flood, of Grand Rapids. This is her first voyage,
                    and she thinks a steamer is something like a yacht, and dresses for the part
                    accordingly. She does not know that it is merely a moving hotel."</p>
                <p>"I am afraid," said Carlton, "to judge from her agitation, that hers is going to
                    be <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0043" n="24"/> what the professionals call
                    a`dressing-room' part. Why is it," he asked, "that the girls on a steamer who
                    wear gold anchors and the men in yachting-caps are always the first to
                    disappear? That man with the sombrero," he went on, "is James M. Pollock, United
                    States Consul to Mauritius; he is going out to his post. I know he is the
                    consul, because he comes from Fort Worth, Texas, and is therefore admirably
                    fitted to speak either French or the native language of the island."</p>
                <p>"Oh, we don't send consuls to Mauritius," laughed Miss Morris. "Mauritius is one
                    of those places from which you buy stamps, but no one really lives or goes
                    there."</p>
                <p>"Where are you going, may I ask?" inquired Carlton.</p>
                <p>Miss Morris said that they were making their way to Constantinople and Athens,
                    and then to Rome; that as they had not had the time to take the southern route,
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0044"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0045"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0046" n="25"/> they purposed to journey across the
                    Continent direct from Paris to the Turkish capital by the Orient Express.</p>
                <p>"We shall be a few days in London, and in Paris only long enough for some
                    clothes," she replied.</p>
                <p>"The trousseau," thought Carlton. "Weeks is what she should have said."</p>
                <p>The three sat together at the captain's table, and as the sea continued rough,
                    saw little of either the captain or his other guests, and were thrown much upon
                    the society of each other. They had innumerable friends and interests in common;
                    and Mrs. Downs, who had been everywhere, and for long seasons at a time, proved
                    as alive as her niece, and Carlton conceived a great liking for her. She seemed
                    to be just and kindly minded, and, owing to her age, to combine the wider
                    judgment of a man with the sympathetic interest of a woman. Sometimes they sat
                    together in a row and <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0047" n="26"/> read, and
                    gossiped over what they read, or struggled up the deck as it rose and fell and
                    buffeted with the wind; and later they gathered in a corner of the saloon and
                    ate late suppers of Carlton's devising, or drank tea in the captain's cabin,
                    which he had thrown open to them. They had started knowing much about one
                    another, and this and the necessary proximity of the ship hastened their
                    acquaintance.</p>
                <p>The sea grew calmer the third day out, and the sun came forth and showed the
                    decks as clean as bread-boards. Miss Morris and Carlton seated themselves on the
                    huge iron riding-bits in the bow, and with their elbows on the rail looked down
                    at the whirling blue water, and rejoiced silently in the steady rush of the
                    great vessel, and in the uncertain warmth of the March sun. Carlton was sitting
                    to leeward of Miss Morris, with a pipe between his teeth. He was warm, and at
                    peace with the world. <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0048" n="27"/> He had found his
                    new acquaintance more than entertaining. She was even friendly, and treated him
                    as though he were much her junior, as is the habit of young women lately married
                    or who are about to be married. Carlton did not resent it; on the contrary, it
                    made him more at his ease with her, and as she herself chose to treat him as a
                    youth, he permitted himself to be as foolish as he pleased.</p>
                <p>"I don't know why it is," he complained, peering over the rail, "but whenever I
                    look over the side to watch the waves a man in a greasy cap always sticks his
                    head out of a hole below me and scatters a barrelful of ashes or potato peelings
                    all over the ocean. It spoils the effect for one. Next time he does it I am
                    going to knock out the ashes of my pipe on the back of his neck." Miss Morris
                    did not consider this worthy of comment, and there was a long lazy pause.</p>
                <p>"You haven't told us where you go after <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0049" n="28"/>
                    London," she said; and then, without waiting for him to reply, she asked, "Is it
                    your professional or your social side that you are treating to a trip this
                    time?"</p>
                <p>"Who told you that?" asked Carlton, smiling.</p>
                <p>"Oh, I don't know. Some man. He said you were a Jekyll and Hyde. Which is Jekyll?
                    You see, I only know your professional side."</p>
                <p>"You must try to find out for yourself by deduction," he said, "as you picked out
                    the other passengers. I am going to Grasse," he continued. "It's the capital of
                    Hohenwald. Do you know it?"</p>
                <p>"Yes," she said; "we were there once for a few days. We went to see the pictures.
                    I suppose you know that the old Duke, the father of the present one, ruined
                    himself almost by buying pictures for the Grasse gallery. We were there at a bad
                    time, though, when the palace was closed to <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0050"
                        n="29"/> visitors, and the gallery too. I suppose that is what is taking you
                    there?"</p>
                <p>"No," Carlton said, shaking his head. "No, it is not the pictures. I am going to
                    Grasse," he said, gravely, "to see the young woman with whom I am in love."</p>
                <p>Miss Morris looked up in some surprise, and smiled consciously, with a natural
                    feminine interest in an affair of love, and one which was a secret as well.</p>
                <p>"Oh," she said, "I beg your pardon; we &mdash; I had not heard of it."</p>
                <p>"No, it is not a thing one could announce exactly," said Carlton; "it is rather
                    in an embryo state as yet &mdash; in fact, I have not met the young lady so
                    far, but I mean to meet her. That's why I am going abroad."</p>
                <p>Miss Morris looked at him sharply to see if he were smiling, but he was, on the
                    contrary, gazing sentimentally at the horizon-line, and puffing meditatively on
                    his pipe. <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0051" n="30"/> He was apparently in
                    earnest, and waiting for her to make some comment.</p>
                <p>"How very interesting!" was all she could think to say.</p>
                <p>"Yes, when you know the details, it is,&mdash;<hi rend="italic">very</hi>
                    interesting," he answered. "She is the Princess Aline of Hohenwald," he
                    explained, bowing his head as though he were making the two young ladies known
                    to one another. "She has several other names, six in all, and her age is
                    twenty-two. That is all I know about her. I saw her picture in an illustrated
                    paper just before I sailed, and I made up my mind I would meet her, and here I
                    am. If she is not in Grasse, I intend to follow her to wherever she may be." He
                    waved his pipe at the ocean before him, and recited, with mock seriousness:</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l> `Across the hills and far away,</l>
                    <l> Beyond their utmost purple rim,</l>
                    <l> And deep into the dying day,</l>
                    <l> The happy Princess followed him.'</l>
                </lg>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0052" n="31"/>
                <p>"Only in this case, you see," said Carlton, "I am following the happy Princess."</p>
                <p>"No; but seriously, though," said Miss Morris, "what is it you mean? Are you
                    going to paint her portrait?"</p>
                <p>"I never thought of that," exclaimed Carlton. "I don't know but what your idea is
                    a good one. Miss Morris, that's a great idea." He shook his head approvingly. "I
                    did not do wrong to confide in you," he said. "It was perhaps taking a liberty;
                    but as you have not considered it as such, I am glad I spoke."</p>
                <p>"But you don't really mean to tell me," exclaimed the girl, facing about, and
                    nodding her head at him, "that you are going abroad after a woman whom you have
                    never seen, and because you like a picture of her in a paper?"</p>
                <p>"I do," said Carlton. "Because I like her picture, and because she is a
                    Princess."</p>
                <p>"Well, upon my word," said Miss Morris, <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0053" n="32"/>
                    gazing at him with evident admiration, "that's what my younger brother would
                    call a distinctly sporting proposition. Only I don't see," she added, "what her
                    being a Princess has to do with it."</p>
                <p>"You don't?" laughed Carlton, easily. That's the best part of it &mdash;
                    that's the plot. The beauty of being in love with a Princess, Miss Morris," he
                    said, "lies in the fact that you can't marry her; that you can love her deeply
                    and forever, and nobody will ever come to you and ask your intentions, or hint
                    that after such a display of affection you ought to do something. Now, with a
                    girl who is not a Princess, even if she understands the situation herself, and
                    wouldn't marry you to save her life, still there is always some one &mdash;
                    a father, or a mother, or one of your friends &mdash; who makes it his
                    business to interfere, and talks about it, and bothers you both. But with a
                    Princess, you see, that is all eliminated. You can't <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0054" n="33"/> marry a Princess, because they won't
                    let you. A Princess has got to marry a real royal chap, and so you are perfectly
                    ineligible and free to sigh for her, and make pretty speeches to her, and see
                    her as often as you can, and revel in your devotion and unrequited affection."</p>
                <p>Miss Morris regarded him doubtfully. She did not wish to prove herself too
                    credulous. "And you honestly want me, Mr. Carlton, to believe that you are going
                    abroad just for this?"</p>
                <p>"You see," Carlton answered her, "if you only knew me better you would have no
                    doubt on the subject at all. It isn't the thing some men would do, I admit, but
                    it is exactly what any one who knows me would expect of me. I should describe
                    it, having had acquaintance with the young man for some time, as being eminently
                    characteristic. And besides, think what a good story it makes! Every other man
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0055" n="34"/> who goes abroad this summer will
                    try to tell about his travels when he gets back to New York, and, as usual, no
                    one will listen to him. But they will <hi rend="italic">have</hi> to listen to
                    me. `You've been across since I saw you last. What did you do?' they'll ask,
                    politely. And then, instead of simply telling them that I have been in Paris or
                    London, I can say, `Oh, I've been chasing around the globe after the Princess
                    Aline of Hohenwald.' That sounds interesting, doesn't it? When you come to think
                    of it," Carlton continued, meditatively, "it is not so very remarkable. Men go
                    all the way to Cuba and Mexico, and even to India, after orchids, after a nasty
                    flower that grows in an absurd way on the top of a tree. Why shouldn't a young
                    man go as far as Germany after a beautiful Princess, who walks on the ground,
                    and who can talk and think and feel? She is much more worth while than an
                    orchid."</p>
                <p>Miss Morris laughed indulgently. "Well, <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0056" n="35"/>
                    I didn't know such devotion existed at this end of the century," she said; "it's
                    quite nice and encouraging. I hope you will succeed, I am sure. I only wish we
                    were going to be near enough to see how you get on. I have never been a
                    confidante when there was a real Princess concerned," she said; "it makes it so
                    much more amusing. May one ask what your plans are?"</p>
                <p>Carlton doubted if he had any plans as yet. "I have to reach the ground first,"
                    he said, "and after that I must reconnoitre. I may possibly adopt your idea, and
                    ask to paint her portrait, only I dislike confusing my social and professional
                    sides. As a matter of fact, though," he said, after a pause, laughing guiltily,
                    "I have done a little of that already. I prepared her, as it were, for my
                    coming. I sent her studies of two pictures I made last winter in Berlin. One of
                    the Prime Minister, and one of Ludwig, the tragedian at the Court Theatre. I <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0057" n="36"/> sent them to her through my London
                    agent, so that she would think they had come from some one of her English
                    friends, and I told the dealer not to let any one know who had forwarded them.
                    My idea was that it might help me, perhaps, if she knew something about me
                    before I appeared in person. It was a sort of letter of introduction written by
                    myself."</p>
                <p>"Well, really," expostulated Miss Morris, you certainly woo in a royal way. Are
                    you in the habit of giving away your pictures to any one whose photograph you
                    happen to like? That seems to me to be giving new lamps for old to a degree. I
                    must see if I haven't some of my sister's photographs in my trunk. She is
                    considered very beautiful."</p>
                <p>"Well, you wait until you see this particular portrait, and &mdash; you will
                    understand it better," said Carlton.</p>
                <p>The steamer reached Southampton early <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0058" n="37"/>
                    in the afternoon, and Carlton secured a special compartment on the express to
                    London for Mrs. Downs and her niece and himself, with one adjoining for their
                    maid and Nolan. It was a beautiful day, and Carlton sat with his eyes fixed upon
                    the passing fields and villages, exclaiming with pleasure from time to time at
                    the white roads and the feathery trees and hedges, and the red roofs of the inns
                    and square towers of the village churches.</p>
                <p>"Hedges are better than barbed-wire fences, aren't they?" he said. "You see that
                    girl picking wild flowers from one of them? She looks just as though she were
                    posing for a picture for an illustrated paper. She couldn't pick flowers from a
                    barbed-wire fence, could she? And there would probably be a tramp along the road
                    somewhere to frighten her; and see &mdash; the chap in knickerbockers
                    farther down the road leaning on the stile. I am sure he is waiting <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0059" n="38"/> for her; and here comes a coach," he
                    ran on. "Don't the red wheels look well against the hedges? It's a pretty little
                    country, England, isn't it? &mdash; like a private park or a model village.
                    I am glad to get back to it &mdash; I am glad to see the three-and-six signs
                    with the little slanting dash between the shillings and pennies. Yes, even the
                    steam-rollers and the man with the red flag in front are welcome." </p>
                <p>"I suppose," said Mrs. Downs, "it's because one has been so long on the ocean
                    that the ride to London seems so interesting. It always pays me for the entire
                    trip. Yes," she said, with a sigh, "in spite of the patent-medicine signs they
                    have taken to putting up all along the road. It seems a pity they should adopt
                    our bad habits instead of our good ones."</p>
                <p>"They are a bit slow at adopting anything," commented Carlton. "Did you know,
                    Mrs. Downs, that electric lights are <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0060" n="39"/>
                    still as scarce in London as they are in Timbuctoo? Why, I saw an electric-light
                    plant put up in a Western town in three days once; there were over a hundred
                    burners in one saloon, and the engineer who put them up told me in confidence
                    that &mdash; "</p>
                <p>What the chief engineer told him in confidence was never disclosed, for at that
                    moment Miss Morris interrupted him with a sudden sharp exclamation.</p>
                <p>"Oh, Mr. Carlton," she exclaimed, breathlessly, "listen to this!" She had been
                    reading one of the dozen papers which Carlton had purchased at the station, and
                    was now shaking one of them at him, with her eyes fixed on the open page.</p>
                <p>"My dear Edith," remonstrated her aunt, Mr. Carlton was telling us &mdash; "</p>
                <p>"Yes, I know," exclaimed Miss Morris, laughing, "but this interests him much more
                    than electric lights. "Who do you think is in London?" she cried, raising her
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0061" n="40"/> eyes to his, and pausing for
                    proper dramatic effect. "The Princess Aline of Hohenwald!"</p>
                <p>"No?" shouted Carlton.</p>
                <p>"Yes," Miss Morris answered, mocking his tone. "Listen. `The Queen's
                    Drawing-room' &mdash; em &mdash; e &mdash; m &mdash; `on her
                    right was the Princess of Wales' &mdash; em &mdash; m. Oh, I can't find
                    it &mdash; no &mdash; yes, here it is. `Next to her stood the Princess
                    Aline of Hohenwald. She wore a dress of white silk, with train of silver brocade
                    trimmed with fur. Ornaments &mdash; emeralds and diamonds; orders
                    &mdash; Victoria and Albert, jubilee Commemoration Medal, Coburg and Gotha,
                    and Hohenwald and Grasse.'"</p>
                <p>"By Jove!" cried Carlton, excitedly. "I say, is that really there? Let me see it,
                    please, for myself."</p>
                <p>Miss Morris handed him the paper, with her finger on the paragraph, and picking
                    up another, began a search down its columns.</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0062" n="41"/>
                <p>"You are right," exclaimed Carlton, solemnly; "it's she, sure enough. And here
                    I've been within two hours of her and didn't know it?"</p>
                <p>Miss Morris gave another triumphant cry, as though she had discovered a vein of
                    gold.</p>
                <p>"Yes, and here she is again," she said, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gentlewoman:</hi> `The Queen's dress was of black, as usual, but relieved by a
                    few violet ribbons in the bonnet; and Princess Beatrice, who sat by her mother's
                    side, showed but little trace of the anxiety caused by Princess Ena's accident.
                    Princess Aline, on the front seat, in a light brown jacket and a becoming
                    bonnet, gave the necessary touch to a picture which Londoners would be glad to
                    look upon more often.'"</p>
                <p>Carlton sat staring forward, with his hands on his knees, and with his eyes open
                    wide from excitement. He presented <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0063" n="42"/> so
                    unusual an appearance of bewilderment and delight that Mrs. Downs looked at him
                    and at her niece for some explanation. "The young lady seems to interest you,"
                    said she, tentatively.</p>
                <p>"She is the most charming creature in the world, Mrs. Downs," cried Carlton, it
                    and I was going all the way to Grasse to see her, and now it turns out that she
                    is here in England, within a few miles of us." He turned and waved his hands at
                    the passing landscape. "Every minute brings us nearer together."</p>
                <p>And you didn't feel it in the air!" mocked Miss Morris, laughing. "You are a
                    pretty poor sort of a man to let a girl tell you where to find the woman you
                    love."</p>
                <p>Carlton did not answer, but stared at her very seriously and frowned intently.
                    "Now I have got to begin all over again and readjust things," he said. "We might
                    have <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0064" n="43"/> guessed she would be in London,
                    on account of this royal wedding. It is a great pity it isn't later in the
                    season, when there would be more things going on and more chances of meeting
                    her. Now they will all be interested in themselves, and, being extremely
                    exclusive, no one who isn't a cousin to the bridegroom or an Emperor would have
                    any chance at all. Still, I can see her! I can look at her, and that's
                    something."</p>
                <p>"It is better than a photograph, anyway," said Miss Morris.</p>
                <p>"They will be either at Buckingham Palace or at Windsor, or they will stop at
                    Brown's," said Carlton. "All royalties go to Brown's. I don't know why, unless
                    it is because it is so expensive; or maybe it is expensive because royalties go
                    there; but, in any event, if they are not at the palace, that is where they will
                    be, and that is where I shall have to go too."</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0065" n="44"/>
                <p>When the train drew up at Victoria Station, Carlton directed Nolan to take his
                    things to Brown's Hotel, but not to unload them until he had arrived. Then he
                    drove with the ladies to Cox's, and saw them settled there. He promised to
                    return at once to dine, and to tell them what he had discovered in his absence.
                    "You've got to help me in this, Miss Morris," he said, nervously. "I am
                    beginning to feel that I am not worthy of her."</p>
                <p>"Oh yes, you are!" she said, laughing; "but don't forget that `it's not the lover
                    who comes to woo, but the lover's <hi rend="italic">way</hi> of wooing,' and
                    that `faint heart' &mdash; and the rest of it."</p>
                <p>"Yes, I know," said Carlton, doubtfully; but it's a bit sudden, isn't it?"</p>
                <p>"Oh, I am ashamed of you! You are frightened."</p>
                <p>"No, not frightened, exactly," said the painter. "I think it's just natural
                    emotion."</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0066" n="45"/>
                <p>As Carlton turned into Albemarle Street he noticed a red carpet stretching from
                    the doorway of Brown's Hotel out across the sidewalk to a carriage, and a
                    bareheaded man bustling about apparently assisting several gentlemen to get into
                    it. This and another carriage and Nolan's four-wheeler blocked the way; but
                    without waiting for them to move up, Carlton leaned out of his hansom and called
                    the bareheaded man to its side.</p>
                <p>"Is the Duke of Hohenwald stopping at your hotel?" he asked. The bareheaded man
                    answered that he was.</p>
                <p>"All right, Nolan," cried Carlton. "They can take in the trunks."</p>
                <p>Hearing this, the bareheaded man hastened to help Carlton to alight. "That was
                    the Duke who just drove off, sir; and those," he said, pointing to three muffled
                    figures who were stepping into a second carriage, " are his sisters, the
                    Princesses."</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0067" n="46"/>
                <p>Carlton stopped midway, with one foot on the step and the other in the air.</p>
                <p>"The deuce they are!" he exclaimed; and which is &mdash; " he began, eagerly,
                    and then remembering himself, dropped back on the cushions of the hansom.</p>
                <p>He broke into the little dining-room at Cox's in so excited a state that two
                    dignified old gentlemen who were eating there sat open-mouthed in astonished
                    disapproval. Mrs. Downs and Miss Morris had just come down stairs.</p>
                <p>"I have seen her!" Carlton cried, ecstatically; "only half an hour in the town,
                    and I've seen her already!"</p>
                <p>"No, really?" exclaimed Miss Morris. "And how did she look? Is she as beautiful
                    as you expected?"</p>
                <p>"Well, I can't tell yet," Carlton answered.</p>
                <p>There were three of them, and they were all muffled up, and which one of the
                    three she was I don't know. She wasn't labelled, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0068"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0069"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0070" n="47"/> as in the picture, but she was there,
                    and I saw her. The woman I love was one of that three, and I have engaged rooms
                    at the hotel, and this very night the same roof shelters us both."</p>
            </div1>
            <div1 id="d4" n="2" type="chapter">
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0071" n="48"/>
                <p>"The course of true love certainly runs smoothly with you," said Miss Morris, as
                    they seated themselves at the table. "What is your next move? What do you mean
                    to do now?"</p>
                <p>"The rest is very simple," said Carlton. "To-morrow morning I will go to the Row;
                    I will be sure to find some one there who knows all about them &mdash; where
                    they are going, and who they are seeing, and what engagements they may have.
                    Then it will only be a matter of looking up some friend in the Household or in
                    one of the embassies who can present me."</p>
                <p>"Oh," said Miss Morris, in the tone of keenest disappointment, "but that is such
                    a commonplace ending! You started out so <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0072" n="49"
                    /> romantically. Couldn't you manage to meet her in a less conventional way?"</p>
                <p>"I am afraid not," said Carlton. "You see, I want to meet her very much, and to
                    meet her very soon, and the quickest way of meeting her, whether it's romantic
                    or not, isn't a bit too quick for me. There will be romance enough after I am
                    presented, if I have my way."</p>
                <p>But Carlton was not to have his way; for he had overlooked the fact that it
                    requires as many to make an introduction as a bargain, and he had left the Duke
                    of Hohenwald out of his considerations. He met many people he knew in the Row
                    the next morning; they asked him to lunch, and brought their horses up to the
                    rail, and he patted the horses' heads, and led the conversation around to the
                    royal wedding, and through it to the Hohenwalds. He learned that they had
                    attended a reception at the German Embassy on the previous night, and it was one
                    of the <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0073" n="50"/> secretaries of that embassy who
                    informed him of their intended departure that morning on the eleven o'clock
                    train to Paris.</p>
                <p>"To Paris!" cried Carlton, in consternation. "What! all of them?"</p>
                <p>"Yes, all of them, of course. Why?" asked the young German. But Carlton was
                    already dodging across the tan-bark to Piccadilly and waving his stick at a
                    hansom.</p>
                <p>Nolan met him at the door of Brown's Hotel with an anxious countenance.</p>
                <p>"Their Royal Highnesses have gone, sir," he said. "But I've packed your trunks
                    and sent them to the station. Shall I follow them sir?"</p>
                <p>"Yes," said Carlton. "Follow the trunks and follow the Hohenwalds. I will come
                    over on the Club train at four. Meet me at the station, and tell me to what
                    hotel they have gone. Wait; if I miss you, you can find me at the Hotel
                    Continental; but if they go straight on through Paris, you go with <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0074" n="51"/> them, and telegraph me here and to the
                    Continental. Telegraph at every station, so I can keep track of you. Have you
                    enough money?"</p>
                <p>"I have, sir &mdash; enough for a long trip, sir."</p>
                <p>"Well, you'll need it," said Carlton, grimly. This is going to be a long trip. It
                    is twenty minutes to eleven now; you will have to hurry. Have you paid my bill
                    here?"</p>
                <p>"I have, sir," said Nolan.</p>
                <p>"Then get off, and don't lose sight of those people again."</p>
                <p>Carlton attended to several matters of business, and then lunched with Mrs. Downs
                    and her niece. He had grown to like them very much, and was sorry to lose sight
                    of them, but consoled himself by thinking he would see them a few days at least
                    in Paris. He judged that he would be there for some time, as he did not think
                    the Princess Aline and her sisters would pass through that city <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0075" n="52"/> without stopping to visit the shops on
                    the Rue de la Paix.</p>
                <p>"All women are not princesses," he argued, but all princesses are women."</p>
                <p>"We will be in Paris on Wednesday," Mrs. Downs told him. "The Orient Express
                    leaves there twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays, and we have taken an
                    apartment for next Thursday, and will go right on to Constantinople."</p>
                <p>"But I thought you said you had to buy a lot of clothes there?" Carlton
                    expostulated.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Downs said that they would do that on their way home.</p>
                <p>Nolan met Carlton at the station, and told him that he had followed the
                    Hohenwalds to the Hotel Meurice. "There is the Duke, sir, and the three
                    Princesses," Nolan said, "and there are two German gentlemen acting as
                    equerries, and an English captain, a sort of A.D.C. to the Duke, and two elderly
                    ladies, <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0076" n="53"/> and eight servants. They
                    travel very simple, sir, and their people are in undress livery. Brown and red,
                    sir."</p>
                <p>Carlton pretended not to listen to this. He had begun to doubt but that Nolan's
                    zeal would lead him into some indiscretion, and would end disastrously to
                    himself. He spent the evening alone in front of the Cafe de la Paix, pleasantly
                    occupied in watching the life and movement of that great meeting of the
                    highways. It did not seem possible that he had ever been away. It was as though
                    he had picked up a book and opened it at the page and place at which he had left
                    off reading it a moment before. There was the same type, the same plot, and the
                    same characters, who were doing the same characteristic things. Even the waiter
                    who tipped out his coffee knew him; and he knew, or felt as though he knew, half
                    of those who passed, or who shared with him the half of the sidewalk. The women
                    at the next table <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0077" n="54"/> considered the slim,
                    good-looking young American with friendly curiosity, and the men with them
                    discussed him in French, until a well-known Parisian recognized Carlton in
                    passing, and hailed him joyously in the same language, at which the women
                    laughed and the men looked sheepishly conscious.</p>
                <p>On the following morning Carlton took up his post in the open court of the
                    Meurice, with his coffee and the <hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi> to excuse his
                    loitering there. He had not been occupied with these over-long before Nolan
                    approached him, in some excitement, with the information that their Royal
                    Highnesses &mdash; as he delighted to call them &mdash; were at that
                    moment "coming down the lift."</p>
                <p>Carlton could hear their voices, and wished to step around the corner and see
                    them; it was for this chance he had been waiting; but he could not afford to act
                    in so undignified a manner before Nolan, so he <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0078"
                        n="55"/> merely crossed his legs nervously, and told the servant to go back
                    to the rooms.</p>
                <p>"Confound him!" he said; "I wish he would let me conduct my own affairs in my own
                    way. If I don't stop him, he'll carry the Princess Aline off by force and send
                    me word where he has hidden her."</p>
                <p>The Hohenwalds had evidently departed for a day's outing, as up to five o'clock
                    they had not returned; and Carlton, after loitering all the afternoon, gave up
                    waiting for them, and went out to dine at Laurent's, in the Champs Elysees. He
                    had finished his dinner, and was leaning luxuriously forward, with his elbows on
                    the table, and knocking the cigar ashes into his coffee-cup. He was pleasantly
                    content. The trees hung heavy with leaves over his head, a fountain played and
                    overflowed at his elbow, and the lamps of the fiacres passing and repassing on
                    the Avenue of the Champs Elysees shone like giant fire-flies through the
                    foliage. The <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0079" n="56"/> touch of the gravel
                    beneath his feet emphasized the free, out-of-door charm of the place, and the
                    faces of the others around him looked more than usually cheerful in the light of
                    the candles flickering under the clouded shades. His mind had gone back to his
                    earlier student days in Paris, when life always looked as it did now in the
                    brief half-hour of satisfaction which followed a cold bath or a good dinner, and
                    he had forgotten himself and his surroundings. It was the voices of the people
                    at the table behind him that brought him back to the present moment. A man was
                    talking; he spoke in English, with an accent.</p>
                <p>"I should like to go again through the Luxembourg," he said; "but you need not be
                    bound by what I do."</p>
                <p>"I think it would be pleasanter if we all keep together," said a girl's voice,
                    quietly. She also spoke in English, and with the same accent.</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0080"/>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0081"/>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0082" n="57"/>
                <p>The people whose voices had interrupted him were sitting and standing around a
                    long table, which the waiters had made large enough for their party by placing
                    three of the smaller ones side by side; they had finished their dinner, and the
                    women, who sat with their backs towards Carlton, were pulling on their gloves.</p>
                <p>"Which is it to be, then?" said the gentleman, smiling. "The pictures or the
                    dressmakers?"</p>
                <p>The girl who had first spoken turned to the one next to her.</p>
                <p>"Which would you rather do, Aline?" she asked.</p>
                <p>Carlton moved so suddenly that the men behind him looked at him curiously; but he
                    turned, nevertheless, in his chair and faced them, and in order to excuse his
                    doing so beckoned to one of the waiters. He was within two feet of the girl who
                    had been called "Aline." She raised her head to <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0083"
                        n="58"/> speak, and saw Carlton staring open-eyed at her. She glanced at him
                    for an instant, as if to assure herself that she did not know him, and then,
                    turning to her brother, smiled in the same tolerant, amused way in which she had
                    so often smiled upon Carlton from the picture.</p>
                <p>"I am afraid I had rather go to the Bon March," she said.</p>
                <p>One of the waiters stepped in between them, and Carlton asked him for his bill;
                    but when it came he left it lying on the plate, and sat staring out into the
                    night between the candles, puffing sharply on his cigar, and recalling to his
                    memory his first sight of the Princess Aline of Hohenwald.</p>
                <p>That night, as he turned into bed, he gave a comfortable sigh of content. "I am
                    glad she chose the dressmakers instead of the pictures," he said.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Downs and Miss Morris arrived in Paris on Wednesday, and expressed their <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0084"/> anxiety to have Carlton lunch with them, and
                    to hear him tell of the progress of his love-affair. There was not much to tell;
                    the Hohenwalds had come and gone from the hotel as freely as any other tourists
                    in Paris, but the very lack of ceremony about their movements was in itself a
                    difficulty. The manner of acquaintance he could make in the court of the Hotel
                    Meurice with one of the men over a cup of coffee or a glass of bock would be as
                    readily discontinued as begun, and for his purpose it would have been much
                    better if the Hohenwalds had been living in state with a visitors' book and a
                    chamberlain.</p>
                <p>On Wednesday evening Carlton took the ladies to the opera, where the Hohenwalds
                    occupied a box immediately opposite them. Carlton pretended to be surprised at
                    this fact, but Mrs. Downs doubted his sincerity.</p>
                <p>"I saw Nolan talking to their courier today," <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0085"
                        n="60"/> she said, "and I fancy he asked a few leading questions."</p>
                <p>"Well, he didn't learn much if he did," he said. "The fellow only talks German."</p>
                <p>"Ah, then he has been asking questions!" said Miss Morris.</p>
                <p>"Well, he does it on his own responsibility," said Carlton, "for I told him to
                    have nothing to do with servants. He has too much zeal, has Nolan; I'm afraid of
                    him."</p>
                <p>"If you were only half as interested as he is," said Miss Morris, "you would have
                    known her long ago."</p>
                <p>"Long ago?" exclaimed Carlton. "I only saw her four days since."</p>
                <p>"She is certainly very beautiful," said Miss Morris, looking across the
                    auditorium.</p>
                <p>"But she isn't there," said Carlton.</p>
                <p>That's the eldest sister; the two other sisters went out on the coach this
                    morning to Versailles, and were too tired to come tonight. At least, so Nolan
                    says. He seems <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0086" n="61"/> to have established a
                    friendship for their English maid, but whether it's on my account or his own I
                    don't know. I doubt his unselfishness."</p>
                <p>"How disappointing of her!" said Miss Morris. And after you had selected a box
                    just across the way, too. It is such a pity to waste it on us." Carlton smiled,
                    and looked up at her impudently, as though he meant to say something; but
                    remembering that she was engaged to be married, changed his mind, and lowered
                    his eyes to his programme.</p>
                <p>"Why didn't you say it?" asked Miss Morris, calmly, turning her glass to the
                    stage. "Wasn't it pretty?" </p>
                <p>"No," said Carlton &mdash; " not pretty enough."</p>
                <p>The ladies left the hotel the next day to take the Orient Express, which left
                    Paris at six o'clock. They had bidden Carlton goodbye at four the same
                    afternoon, and as he had come to their rooms for that purpose, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0087" n="62"/> they were in consequence a little
                    surprised to see him at the station, running wildly along the platform, followed
                    by Nolan and a porter. He came into their compartment after the train had
                    started, and shook his head sadly at them from the door.</p>
                <p>"Well, what do you think of this?" he said. "You can't get rid of me, you see.
                    I'm going with you."</p>
                <p>"Going with us?" asked Mrs. Downs. "How far?"</p>
                <p>Carlton laughed, and, coming inside, dropped onto the cushions with a sigh. "I
                    don't know," he said, dejectedly. "All the way, I'm afraid. That is, I mean, I'm
                    very glad I am to have your society for a few days more; but really I didn't
                    bargain for this."</p>
                <p>"You don't mean to tell me that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are on this train?"
                    said Miss Morris.</p>
                <p>"They are," said Carlton. "They have a car to themselves at the rear. They only
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0088" n="63"/> made up their minds to go this
                    morning, and they nearly succeeded in giving me the slip again; but it seems
                    that their English maid stopped Nolan in the hall to bid him good-bye, and so he
                    found out their plans. They are going direct to Constantinople, and then to
                    Athens. They had meant to stay in Paris two weeks longer, it seems, but they
                    changed their minds last night. It was a very close shave for me. I only got
                    back to the hotel in time to hear from the concierge that Nolan had flown with
                    all of my things, and left word for me to follow. Just fancy! Suppose I had
                    missed the train, and had had to chase him clear across the continent of Europe
                    with not even a razor &mdash; "</p>
                <p>"I am glad," said Miss Morris, that Nolan has not taken a fancy to <hi
                        rend="italic">me</hi>. I doubt if I could resist such impetuosity."</p>
                <p>The Orient Express, in which Carlton and the mistress of his heart and fancy were
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0089" n="64"/> speeding towards the horizon's
                    utmost purple rim, was made up of six cars, one dining-car with a
                    smoking-apartment attached, and five sleeping-cars, including the one reserved
                    for the Duke of Hohenwald and his suite. These cars were lightly built, and
                    rocked in consequence, and the dust raised by the rapid movement of the train
                    swept through cracks and open windows, and sprinkled the passengers with a fine
                    and irritating coating of soot and earth. There was one servant to the entire
                    twenty-two passengers. He spoke eight languages, and never slept; but as his
                    services were in demand by several people in as many different cars at the same
                    moment he satisfied no one, and the complaint-box in the smoking-car was stuffed
                    full to the slot in consequence before they had crossed the borders of France.</p>
                <p>Carlton and Miss Morris went out upon one of the platforms and sat down upon a
                    tool-box. "It's isn't as comfortable here <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0090"
                        n="65"/> as in an observation-car at home," said Carlton, "but it's just as
                    noisy."</p>
                <p>He pointed out to her from time to time the peasants gathering twigs, and the
                    blue-bloused gendarmes guarding the woods and the fences skirting them. "Nothing
                    is allowed to go to waste in this country," he said. "It looks as though they
                    went over it once a month with a lawn-mower and a pruning-knife. I believe they
                    number the the trees as we number the houses."</p>
                <p>"And did you notice the great fortifications covered with grass?" she said. "We
                    have passed such a lot of them."</p>
                <p>Carlton nodded.</p>
                <p>"And did you notice that they all faced only one way?"</p>
                <p>Carlton laughed, and nodded again. "Towards Germany," he said.</p>
                <p>By the next day they had left the tall poplars and white roads behind them, and
                    were crossing the land of low shiny black <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0091"
                        n="66"/> helmets and brass spikes. They had come into a country of low
                    mountains and black forests, with old fortified castles topping the hills, and
                    with red-roofed villages scattered around the base.</p>
                <p>"How very military it all is!" Mrs. Downs said. "Even the men at the lonely
                    little stations in the forests wear uniforms; and do you notice how each of them
                    rolls up his red flag and holds it like a sword, and salutes the train as it
                    passes?"</p>
                <p>They spent the hour during which the train shifted from one station in Vienna to
                    the other driving about in an open carriage, and stopped for a few moments in
                    front of a cafe to drink beer and to feel solid earth under them again,
                    returning to the train with a feeling which was almost that of getting back to
                    their own rooms. Then they came to great steppes covered with long thick grass,
                    and flooded in places with little lakes of broken ice; great horned cattle <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0092" n="67"/> stood knee-deep in this grass, and at
                    the villages and way-stations were people wearing sheepskin jackets and
                    waistcoats covered with silver buttons. In one place there was a wedding
                    procession waiting for the train to pass, with the friends of the bride and
                    groom in their best clothes, the women with silver breastplates, and boots to
                    their knees. It seemed hardly possible that only two days before they had seen
                    another wedding party in the Champs Elysees, where the men wore evening dress,
                    and the women were bareheaded and with long trains. In forty-eight hours they
                    had passed through republics, principalities, empires, and kingdoms, and from
                    spring to winter. It was like walking rapidly over a painted panorama of Europe.</p>
                <p>On the second evening Carlton went off into the smoking-car alone. The Duke of
                    Hohenwald and two of his friends had finished a late supper, and were seated in
                    the <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0093" n="68"/> apartment adjoining it. The Duke
                    was a young man with a heavy beard and eyeglasses. He was looking over an
                    illustrated catalogue of the Salon, and as Carlton dropped on the sofa opposite
                    the Duke raised his head and looked at him curiously, and then turned over
                    several pages of the catalogue and studied one of them, and then back at
                    Carlton, as though he were comparing him with something on the page before him.
                    Carlton was looking out at the night, but he could follow what was going
                    forward, as it was reflected in the glass of the car window. He saw the Duke
                    hand the catalogue to one of the equerries, who raised his eyebrows and nodded
                    his head in assent. Carlton wondered what this might mean, until he remembered
                    that there was a portrait of himself by a French artist in the Salon, and
                    concluded it had been reproduced in the catalogue. He could think of nothing
                    else which would explain the interest <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0094"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0095"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0096" n="69"/> the two men showed in him. On the
                    morning following he sent Nolan out to purchase a catalogue at the first station
                    at which they stopped, and found that his guess was a correct one. A portrait of
                    himself had been reproduced in black and white, with his name below it.</p>
                <p>"Well, they know who I am now," he said to Miss Morris, "even, if they don't know
                    me. That honor is still in store for them."</p>
                <p>"I wish they did not lock themselves up so tightly," said Miss Morris. "I want to
                    see her very much. Cannot we walk up and down the platform at the next station?
                    She may be at the window."</p>
                <p>"Of course," said Carlton. "You could have seen her at Buda-Pesth if you had
                    spoken of it. She was walking up and down then. The next time the train stops we
                    will prowl up and down and feast our eyes upon her."</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0097" n="70"/>
                <p>But Miss Morris had her wish gratified without that exertion. The Hohenwalds were
                    served in the dining-car after the other passengers had finished, and were in
                    consequence only to be seen when they passed by the doors of the other
                    compartments. But this same morning, after luncheon, the three Princesses,
                    instead of returning to their own car, seated themselves in the compartment
                    adjoining the dining-car, while the men of their party lit their cigars and sat
                    in a circle around them.</p>
                <p>"I was wondering how long they could stand three men smoking in one of the boxes
                    they call cars," said Mrs. Downs. She was seated between Miss Morris and
                    Carlton, directly opposite the Hohenwalds, and so near them that she had to
                    speak in a whisper. To avoid doing this Miss Morris asked Carlton for a pencil,
                    and scribbled with it in the novel she held on her lap. Then she passed them
                    both back to him, <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0098" n="71"/> and said, aloud:
                    "Have you read this? It has such a pretty dedication." The dedication read,
                    "Which is Aline?" And Carlton, taking the pencil in his turn, made a rapid
                    sketch of her on the fly-leaf, and wrote beneath it: "This is she. Do you wonder
                    I travelled four thousand miles to see her?"</p>
                <p>Miss Morris took the book again, and glanced at the sketch, and then at the three
                    Princesses, and nodded her head. "It is very beautiful," she said, gravely,
                    looking out at the passing landscape.</p>
                <p>"Well, not beautiful exactly," answered Carlton, surveying the hills critically,
                    "but certainly very attractive. It is worth travelling a long way to see, and I
                    should think one would grow very fond of it."</p>
                <p>Miss Morris tore the fly-leaf out of the book, and slipped it between the pages.
                    "May I keep it?" she said. Carlton nodded. "And will you sign it?" she asked,
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0099" n="72"/> smiling. Carlton shrugged his
                    shoulders, and laughed. "If you wish it," he answered.</p>
                <p>The Princess wore a gray cheviot travelling dress, as did her sisters, and a gray
                    Alpine hat. She was leaning back, talking to the English captain who accompanied
                    them, and laughing. Carlton thought he had never seen a woman who appealed so
                    strongly to every taste of which he was possessed. She seemed so sure of
                    herself, so alert, and yet so gracious, so easily entertained, and yet, when she
                    turned her eyes towards the strange, dismal landscape, so seriously intent upon
                    its sad beauty. The English captain dropped his head, and with the pretence of
                    pulling at his mustache, covered his mouth as he spoke to her. When he had
                    finished he gazed consciously at the roof of the car, and she kept her eyes
                    fixed steadily at the object towards which they had turned when he had ceased
                    speaking, and then, after a <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0100" n="73"/> decent
                    pause, turned her eyes, as Carlton knew she would, towards him.</p>
                <p>"He was telling her who I am," he thought, "and about the picture in the
                    catalogue."</p>
                <p>In a few moments she turned to her sister and spoke to her, pointing out at
                    something in the scenery, and the same pantomime was repeated, and again with
                    the third sister.</p>
                <p>"Did you see those girls talking about you, Mr. Carlton?" Miss Morris asked,
                    after they had left the car.</p>
                <p>Carlton said it looked as though they were.</p>
                <p>"Of course they were," said Miss Morris.</p>
                <p>That Englishman told the Princess Aline something about you, and then she told
                    her sister, and she told the eldest one. It would be nice if they inherit their
                    father's interest in painting, wouldn't it?"</p>
                <p>"I would rather have it degenerate into an interest in painters myself," said
                    Carlton.</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0101" n="74"/>
                <p>Miss Morris discovered, after she had returned to her own car, that she had left
                    the novel where she had been sitting, and Carlton sent Nolan back for it. It had
                    slipped to the floor, and the fly-leaf upon which Carlton had sketched the
                    Princess Aline was lying face down beside it. Nolan picked up the leaf, and saw
                    the picture, and read the inscription below: "This is she. Do you wonder I
                    travelled four thousand miles to see her?"</p>
                <p>He handed the book to Miss Morris, and was backing out of the compartment, when
                    she stopped him.</p>
                <p>"There was a loose page in this, Nolan," she said. "It's gone; did you see it?"</p>
                <p>"A loose page, miss?" said Nolan, with some concern. "Oh, yes, miss; I was going
                    to tell you; there was a scrap of paper blew away when I was passing between the
                    carriages. Was it something you wanted, miss?"</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0102" />
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0103" />
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0104" n="75"/>
                <p>"Something I wanted!" exclaimed Miss Morris, in dismay.</p>
                <p>Carlton laughed easily. "It is just as well I didn't sign it, after all," he
                    said. "I don't want to proclaim my devotion to any Hungarian gypsy who happens
                    to read English."</p>
                <p>You must draw me another, as a souvenir," Miss Morris said.</p>
                <p>Nolan continued on through the length of the car until he had reached the one
                    occupied by the Hohenwalds, where he waited on the platform until the English
                    maidservant saw him and came to the door of the carriage.</p>
                <p>What hotel are your people going to stop at in Constantinople?" Nolan asked.</p>
                <p>"The Grande-Bretagne, I think," she answered.</p>
                <p>"That's right," said Nolan, approvingly. That's the one we are going to. I
                    thought <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0105" n="76"/> I would come and tell you
                    about it. And, by-the-way," he said, "here's a picture somebody's made of your
                    Princess Aline. She dropped it, and I picked it up. You had better give it back
                    to her. Well," he added, politely, "I'm glad you are coming to our hotel in
                    Constantinople; it's pleasant having some one to talk to who can speak your own
                    tongue."</p>
                <p>The girl returned to the car, and left Nolan alone upon the platform. He exhaled
                    a long breath of suppressed excitement, and then gazed around nervously upon the
                    empty landscape.</p>
                <p>"I fancy that's going to hurry things up a bit," he murmured, with an anxious
                    smile; "he'd never get along at all if it wasn't for me.</p>
                <p>For reasons possibly best understood by the German ambassador, the state of the
                    Hohenwalds at Constantinople differed greatly from that which had obtained at
                    the French <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0106" n="77"/> capital. They no longer
                    came and went as they wished, or wandered through the show-places of the city
                    like ordinary tourists. There was, on the contrary, not only a change in their
                    manner towards others, but there was an insistence on their part of a difference
                    in the attitude of others towards themselves. This showed itself in the
                    reserving of the half of the hotel for their use, and in the haughty bearing of
                    the equerries, who appeared unexpectedly in magnificent uniforms. The visitors'
                    book was covered with the autographs of all of the important people in the
                    Turkish capital, and the Sultan's carriages stood constantly before the door of
                    the hotel, awaiting their pleasure, until they became as familiar a sight as the
                    street dogs, or as cabs in a hansom-cab rank.</p>
                <p>And in following out the programme which had been laid down for her, the Princess
                    Aline became even less accessible <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0107" n="78"/> to
                    Carlton than before, and he grew desperate and despondent.</p>
                <p>"If the worst comes," he said to Miss Morris, "I shall tell Nolan to give an
                    alarm of fire some night, and then I will run in and rescue her before they find
                    out there is no fire. Or he might frighten the horses some day, and give me a
                    chance to stop them. We might even wait until we reach Greece, and have her
                    carried off by brigands, who would only give her up to me."</p>
                <p>"There are no more brigands in Greece," said Miss Morris; "and besides, why do
                    you suppose they would only give her up to you?"</p>
                <p>"Because they would be imitation brigands," said Carlton, "and would be paid to
                    give her up to no one else."</p>
                <p>"Oh, you plan very well," scoffed Miss Morris, "but you don't <hi rend="italic"
                        >do</hi> anything."</p>
                <p>Carlton was saved the necessity of doing anything that same morning, when the
                    English <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0108" n="79"/> captain in attendance on the
                    Duke sent his card to Carlton's room. He came, he explained, to present the
                    Prince's compliments, and would it be convenient for Mr. Carlton to meet the
                    Duke that afternoon? Mr. Carlton suppressed an unseemly desire to shout, and
                    said, after a moment's consideration, that it would. He then took the English
                    captain down stairs to the smoking-room, and rewarded him for his agreeable
                    message.</p>
                <p>The Duke received Carlton in the afternoon, and greeted him most cordially, and
                    with as much ease of manner as it is possible for a man to possess who has never
                    enjoyed the benefits of meeting other men on an equal footing. He expressed his
                    pleasure in knowing an artist with whose work he was so familiar, and
                    congratulated himself on the happy accident which had brought them both to the
                    same hotel.</p>
                <p>"I have more than a natural interest in <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0109" n="80"/>
                    meeting you," said the Prince, "and for a reason which you may or may not know.
                    I thought possibly you could help me somewhat. I have within the past few days
                    come into the possession of two of your paintings; they are studies, rather, but
                    to me they are even more desirable than the finished work; and I am not correct
                    in saying that they have come to me exactly, but to my sister, the Princess
                    Aline."</p>
                <p>Carlton could not withhold a certain start of surprise. He had not expected that
                    his gift would so soon have arrived, but his face showed only polite attention.</p>
                <p>"The studies were delivered to us in London," continued the Duke. "They are of
                    Ludwig the tragedian, and of the German Prime Minister, two most valuable works,
                    and especially interesting to us. They came without any note or message which
                    would inform us who had sent them, and when my people made inquiries, the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0110" n="81"/> dealer refused to tell them from whom they had come. He had been
                    ordered to forward them to Grasse, but, on learning of our presence in London,
                    sent them direct to our hotel there. Of course it is embarrassing to have so
                    valuable a present from an anonymous friend, especially so for my sister, to
                    whom they were addressed, and I thought that, besides the pleasure of meeting
                    one of whose genius I am so warm an admirer, I might also learn something which
                    would enable me to discover who our friend may be." He paused, but as Carlton
                    said nothing, continued: "As it is now, I do not feel that I can accept the
                    pictures; and yet I know no one to whom they can be returned, unless I send them
                    to the dealer."</p>
                <p>"It sounds very mysterious," said Carlton smiling; "and I am afraid I cannot help
                    you. What work I did in Germany was sold in Berlin before I left, and in a year
                    may have changed hands several times. <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0111" n="82"/>
                    The studies of which you speak are unimportant, and merely studies, and could
                    pass from hand to hand without much record having been kept of them; but
                    personally I am not able to give you any information which would assist you in
                    tracing them."</p>
                <p>"Yes," said the Duke. "Well, then, I shall keep them until I can learn more; and
                    if we can learn nothing, I shall return them to the dealer."</p>
                <p>Carlton met Miss Morris that afternoon in a state of great excitement. "It's
                    come!" he cried &mdash; "it's come! I am to meet her this week. I have met
                    her brother, and he has asked me to dine with them on Thursday night; that's the
                    day before they leave for Athens; and he particularly mentioned that his sisters
                    would be at the dinner, and that it would be a pleasure to present me. It seems
                    that the eldest paints, and all of them love art for art's sake, as their father
                    taught them to do; and, for all we know, <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0112" n="83"
                    /> he may make me court painter, and I shall spend the rest of my life at Grasse
                    painting portraits of the Princess Aline, at the age of twenty-two, and at all
                    future ages. And if he does give me a commission to paint her, I can tell you
                    now in confidence that that picture will require more sittings than any other
                    picture ever painted by man. Her hair will have turned white by the time it is
                    finished, and the gown she started to pose in will have become forty years
                    behind the fashion!"</p>
                <p>On the morning following, Carlton and Mrs. Downs and her niece, with all the
                    tourists in Constantinople, were placed in open carriages by their dragomans,
                    and driven in a long procession to the Seraglio to see the Sultan's treasures.
                    Those of them who had waited two weeks for this chance looked aggrieved at the
                    more fortunate who had come at the eleventh hour on the last night's steamer,
                    and seemed to <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0113" n="84"/> think these latter had
                    attained the privilege without sufficient effort. The ministers of the different
                    legations &mdash; as is the harmless custom of such gentlemen &mdash;
                    had impressed every one for whom they had obtained permission to see the
                    treasures with the great importance of the service rendered, and had succeeded
                    in making every one feel either especially honored or especially uncomfortable
                    at having given them so much trouble. This sense of obligation, and the fact
                    that the dragomans had assured the tourists that they were for the time being
                    the guests of the Sultan, awed and depressed most of the visitors to such an
                    extent that their manner in the long procession of carriages suggested a funeral
                    cortege, with the Hohenwalds in front, escorted by Beys and Pashas, as chief
                    mourners. The procession halted at the palace, and the guests of the Sultan were
                    received by numerous effendis in single-button frock-coats and freshly <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0114" n="85"/> ironed fezzes, who served them with
                    glasses of water, and a huge bowl of some sweet stuff, of which every one was
                    supposed to take a spoonful. There was at first a general fear among the Cook's
                    tourists that there would not be enough of this to go round, which was succeeded
                    by a greater anxiety lest they should be served twice. Some of the tourists put
                    the sweet stuff in their mouths direct and licked the spoon, and others dropped
                    it off the spoon into the glass of water, and stirred it about and sipped at it,
                    and no one knew who had done the right thing, not even those who happened to
                    have done it. Carlton and Miss Morris went out on to the terrace while this
                    ceremony was going forward, and looked out over the great panorama of waters,
                    with the Sea of Marmora on one side, the Golden Horn on the other, and the
                    Bosporus at their feet. The sun was shining mildly, and the waters were <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0115" n="86"/> stirred by great and little vessels; before them on the opposite
                    bank rose the dark green cypresses which marked the grim cemetery of England's
                    dead, and behind them were the great turtle-backed mosques and pencil-like
                    minarets of the two cities, and close at hand the mosaic walls and beautiful
                    gardens of Constantine.</p>
                <p>"Your friends the Hohenwalds don't seem to know you this morning," she said.</p>
                <p>"Oh yes; he spoke to me as we left the hotel," Carlton answered. "But they are on
                    parade at present. There are a lot of their countrymen among the tourists."</p>
                <p>"I feel rather sorry for them," Miss Morris said, looking at the group with an
                    amused smile. "Etiquette cuts them off from so much innocent amusement. Now, you
                    are a gentleman, and the Duke presumably is, and why should you not go over and
                    say, `Your Highness, I wish you would present me to your sister, whom I am to
                    meet at dinner <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0116" n="87"/> to-morrow night. I
                    admire her very much,' and then you could point out the historical features to
                    her, and show her where they have finished off a blue and green tiled wall with
                    a rusty tin roof, and make pretty speeches to her. It wouldn't hurt her, and it
                    would do you a lot of good. The simplest way is always the best way, it seems to
                    me."</p>
                <p>"Oh yes, of course," said Carlton. "Suppose he came over here and said: `Carlton,
                    I wish you would present me to your young American friend. I admire her very
                    much,' I would probably say: `Do you? Well, you will have to wait until she
                    expresses some desire to meet you.' No; etiquette is all right in itself, only
                    some people don't know its laws, and that is the one instance to my mind where
                    ignorance of the law is no excuse.</p>
                <p>Carlton left Miss Morris talking with the Secretary of the American Legation, and
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0117" n="88"/> went to look for Mrs. Downs. When
                    he returned he found that the young Secretary had apparently asked and obtained
                    permission to present the Duke's equerries and some of his diplomatic confreres,
                    who were standing now about her in an attentive semicircle, and pointing out the
                    different palaces and points of interest. Carlton was somewhat disturbed at the
                    sight, and reproached himself with not having presented any one to her before.
                    He was sure now that she must have had a dull time of it; but he wished,
                    nevertheless, that if she was to meet other men, the Secretary had allowed him
                    to act as master of ceremonies.</p>
                <p>"I suppose you know," that gentleman was saying as Carlton came up, "that when
                    you pass by Abydos, on the way to Athens, you will see where Leander swam the
                    Hellespont to meet Hero. That little white light-house is called Leander in
                    honor of him. It makes rather an interesting contrast&mdash; <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0118" n="89"/> does it not? &mdash; to think of
                    that chap swimming along in the dark, and then to find that his monument to-day
                    is a lighthouse, with revolving lamps and electric appliances, and with ocean
                    tramps and bridges and men-of-war around it. We have improved in our mechanism
                    since then," he said, with an air, "but I am afraid the men of to-day don't do
                    that sort of thing for the women of to-day."</p>
                <p>"Then it is the men who have deteriorated," said one of the equerries, bowing to
                    Miss Morris; "it is certainly not the women."</p>
                <p>The two Americans looked at Miss Morris to see how she received this, but she
                    smiled good-naturedly.</p>
                <p>"I know a man who did more than that for a woman," said Carlton, innocently. "He
                    crossed an ocean and several countries to meet her, and he hasn't met her yet."</p>
                <p>Miss Morris looked at him and laughed, <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0119" n="90"/>
                    in the safety that no one understood him but herself.</p>
                <p>"But he ran no danger," she answered.</p>
                <p>"He didn't, didn't he?" said Carlton, looking at her closely and laughing. "I
                    think he was in very great danger all the time."</p>
                <p>"Shocking!" said Miss Morris, reprovingly; "and in her very presence, too." She
                    knitted her brows and frowned at him. "I really believe if you were in prison
                    you would make pretty speeches to the jailer's daughter."</p>
                <p>"Yes," said Carlton, boldly, "or even to a woman who was a prisoner herself."</p>
                <p>"I don't know what you mean," she said, turning away from him to the others. "How
                    far was it that Leander swam?" she asked.</p>
                <p>The English captain pointed out two spots on either bank, and said that the
                    shores of Abydos were a little over that distance apart.</p>
                <p>"As far as that?" said Miss Morris. "How <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0120" n="91"
                    /> much he must have cared for her!" She turned to Carlton for an answer.</p>
                <p>"I beg your pardon," he said. He was measuring the distance between the two
                    points with his eyes.</p>
                <p>"I said how much he must have cared for her! You wouldn't swim that far for a
                    girl."</p>
                <p>"For a girl!" laughed Carlton, quickly. I was just thinking I would do it for
                    fifty dollars."</p>
                <p>The English captain gave a hasty glance at the distance he had pointed out, and
                    then turned to Carlton. "I'll take you," he said, seriously. "I'll bet you
                    twenty pounds you can't do it." There was an easy laugh at Carlton's expense,
                    but he only shook his head and smiled.</p>
                <p>"Leave him alone, captain," said the American Secretary. "It seems to me I
                    remember a story of Mr. Carlton's swimming out from Navesink to meet an ocean
                    liner. It was about three miles, and the ocean was <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0121" n="92"/> rather rough, and when they slowed up
                    he asked them if it was raining in London when they left. They thought he was
                    mad."</p>
                <p>"Is that true, Carlton?" asked the Englishman.</p>
                <p>"Something like it," said the American, except that I didn't ask them if it was
                    raining in London. I asked them for a drink, and it was they who were mad. They
                    thought I was drowning, and slowed up to lower a boat, and when they found out I
                    was just swimming around they were naturally angry.</p>
                <p>"Well, I'm glad you didn't bet with me," said the captain, with a relieved laugh.</p>
                <p>That evening, as the Englishman was leaving the smoking-room, and after he had
                    bidden Carlton good-night, he turned back and said: "I didn't like to ask you
                    before those men this morning, but there was something about your swimming
                    adventure I wanted to know: Did you get that drink?"</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0122" n="93"/>
                <p>I did," said Carlton &mdash; "in a bottle. They nearly broke my shoulder."</p>
                <p>As Carlton came into the breakfast-room on the morning of the day he was to meet
                    the Princess Aline at dinner, Miss Morris was there alone, and he sat down at
                    the same table, opposite to her. She looked at him critically, and smiled with
                    evident amusement.</p>
                <p>"`To-day,'" she quoted, solemnly, "`the birthday of my life has come.'"</p>
                <p>Carlton poured out his coffee, with a shake of his head, and frowned. "Oh, you
                    can laugh," he said, "but I didn't sleep at all last night. I lay awake making
                    speeches to her. I know they are going to put me between the wrong sisters," he
                    complained, "or next to one of those old ladies-in-waiting, or whatever they
                    are."</p>
                <p>How are you going to begin?" said Miss Morris. "Will you tell her you have
                    followed her from London &mdash; or from New York, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0123" n="94"/> rather &mdash; that you are young
                    Lochinvar, who came out of the West, and &mdash; "</p>
                <p>"I don't know," said Carlton, meditatively, "just how I shall begin; but I know
                    the curtain is going to rise promptly at eight o'clock &mdash; about the
                    time the soup comes on, I think. I don't see how she can help but be impressed a
                    little bit. It isn't every day a man hurries around the globe on account of a
                    girl's photograph; and she <hi rend="italic">is</hi> beautiful, isn't she?"</p>
                <p>Miss Morris nodded her head encouragingly.</p>
                <p>"Do you know, sometimes," said Carlton, glancing over his shoulders to see if the
                    waiters were out of hearing, "I fancy she has noticed me. Once or twice I have
                    turned my head in her direction without meaning to, and found her looking
                    &mdash; well, looking my way, at least. Don't you think that is a good
                    sign?" he asked, eagerly.</p>
                <p>"It depends on what you call a `good sign,`" said Miss Morris, judicially. "It is
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0124" n="95"/> a sign you're good to look at, if
                    that's what you want. But you probably know that already, and it's nothing to
                    your credit. It certainly isn't a sign that a person cares for you because she
                    prefers to look at your profile rather than at what the dragomans are trying to
                    show her."</p>
                <p>Carlton drew himself up stiffly. "If you knew your <hi rend="italic">Alice</hi>
                    better," he said, with severity, "you would understand that it is not polite to
                    make personal remarks. I ask you, as my confidante, if you think she has noticed
                    me, and you make fun of my looks! That's not the part of a confidante."</p>
                <p>"Noticed you!" laughed Miss Morris, scornfully. "How could she help it? You are
                    always in the way. You are at the door whenever they go out or come in, and when
                    we are visiting mosques and palaces you are invariably looking at her instead of
                    the tombs and things, with a wistful far-away look, as though you saw a vision.
                    The first time <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0125" n="96"/> you did it, after you
                    had turned away I saw her feel to see if her hair was all right. You quite
                    embarrassed her."</p>
                <p>"I didn't &mdash; I don't!" stammered Carlton, indignantly!" I wouldn't be so
                    rude. Oh, I see I'll have to get another confidante; you are most unsympathetic
                    and unkind."</p>
                <p>But Miss Morris showed her sympathy later in the day, when Carlton needed it
                    sorely; for the dinner towards which he had looked with such pleasurable
                    anticipations and lover-like misgivings did not take place. The Sultan, so the
                    equerry informed him, had, with Oriental unexpectedness, invited the Duke to
                    dine that night at the Palace, and the Duke, much to his expressed regret, had
                    been forced to accept what was in the nature of a command. He sent word by his
                    equerry, however, that the dinner to Mr. Carlton was only a pleasure deferred,
                    and that at Athens, where he understood Carlton <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0126"
                        n="97"/> was also going, he hoped to have the pleasure of entertaining him
                    and making him known to his sisters.</p>
                <p>"He is a selfish young egoist," said Carlton to Mrs. Downs. "As if I cared
                    whether he was at the dinner or not! Why couldn't he have fixed it so I might
                    have dined with his sisters alone? We would never have missed him. I'll never
                    meet her now. I know it; I feel it. Fate is against me. Now I will have to
                    follow them on to Athens, and something will turn up there to keep me away from
                    her. You'll see; you'll see. I wonder where they go from Athens?"</p>
                <p>The Hohenwalds departed the next morning, and as their party had engaged all the
                    state-rooms in the little Italian steamer, Carlton was forced to wait over for
                    the next. He was very gloomy over his disappointment, and Miss Morris did her
                    best to amuse him. She and her aunt were never idle now, and spent the last few
                    days of their stay in Constantinople <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0127" n="98"/>
                    in the bazars or in excursions up and down the river.</p>
                <p>"These are my last days of freedom," Miss Morris said to him once, "and I mean to
                    make the most of them. After this there will be no more travelling for me. And I
                    love it so!" she added, wistfully.</p>
                <p>Carlton made no comment, but he felt a certain contemptuous pity for the young
                    man in America who had required such a sacrifice. "She is too nice a girl to let
                    him know she is making a sacrifice," he thought, "or giving up anything for him,
                    but <hi rend="italic">she</hi> won't forget it." And Carlton again commended
                    himself for not having asked any woman to make any sacrifices for him.</p>
                <p>They left Constantinople for Athens one moonlight night, three days after the
                    Hohenwalds had taken their departure, and as the evening and the air were warm,
                    they remained upon the upper deck until the boat had entered the Dardanelles.
                    There were <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0128" n="99"/> few passengers, and Mrs.
                    Downs went below early, leaving Miss Morris and Carlton hanging over the rail,
                    and looking down upon a band of Hungarian gypsies, who were playing the weird
                    music of their country on the deck beneath them. The low receding hills lay
                    close on either hand, and ran back so sharply from the narrow waterway that they
                    seemed to shut in the boat from the world beyond. The moonlight showed a little
                    mud fort or a thatched cottage on the bank fantastically, as through a mist, and
                    from time to time as they sped forward they saw the camp-fire of a sentry, and
                    his shadow as he passed between it and them, or stopped to cover it with wood.
                    The night was so still that they could hear the waves in the steamer's wake
                    washing up over the stones on either shore, and the muffled beat of the engines
                    echoed back from either side of the valley through which they passed. There was
                    a great lantern hanging midway from <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0129" n="100"/>
                    the mast, and shining down upon the lower deck. It showed a group of Greeks,
                    Turks, and Armenians, in strange costumes, sleeping, huddled together in
                    picturesque confusion over the bare boards, or wide-awake and voluble, smoking
                    and chatting together in happy company. The music of the tizanes rose in notes
                    of passionate ecstasy and sharp, unexpected bursts of melody. It ceased and
                    be-an again, as though the musicians were feeling their way, and then burst out
                    once more into shrill defiance. It stirred Carlton with a strange turbulent
                    unrest. From the banks the night wind brought soft odors of fresh earth and of
                    heavy foliage.</p>
                <p>"The music of different countries," Carlton said at last, "means many different
                    things. But it seems to me that the music of Hungary is the music of love."</p>
                <p>Miss Morris crossed her arms comfortably on the rail, and he heard her laugh
                    softly. "Oh no, it is not," she said, undisturbed. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0130" n="101"/> "It is a passionate, gusty, heady
                    sort of love, if you like, but it's no more like the real thing than burgundy is
                    like clear, cold, good water. It's not the real thing at all."</p>
                <p>"I beg your pardon," said Carlton, meekly.</p>
                <p>"Of course I don't know anything about it." He had been waked out of the spell
                    which the night and the tizanes had placed upon him as completely as though some
                    one had shaken him sharply by the shoulder. "I bow," he said, "to your superior
                    knowledge. I know nothing about it."</p>
                <p>"No; you are quite right. I don't believe you do know anything about it," said
                    the girl, "or you wouldn't have made such a comparison."</p>
                <p>"Do you know, Miss Morris," said Carlton, seriously, "that I believe I'm not able
                    to care for a woman as other men do &mdash; at least as some men do; it's
                    just lacking in me, and always will be lacking. It's like an <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0131" n="102"/> ear for music; if you haven't got it,
                    if it isn't born in you, you'll never have it. It's not a thing you can
                    cultivate, and I feel that it's not only a misfortune, but a fault. Now I
                    honestly believe that I care more for the Princess Aline, whom I have never met,
                    than many other men could care for her if they knew her well; but what they feel
                    would last, and I have doubts from past experience that what I feel would. I
                    don't doubt it while it exists, but it never does exist long, and so I am afraid
                    it is going to be with me to the end of the chapter." He paused for a moment,
                    but the girl did not answer. "I am speaking in earnest now," he added, with a
                    rueful laugh.</p>
                <p>"I see you are," she replied, briefly. She seemed to be considering his condition
                    as he had described it to her, and he did not interrupt her. From below them
                    came the notes of the waltz the gypsies played. It was full of the undercurrent
                    of sadness that a waltz <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0132" n="103"/> should have,
                    and filled out what Carlton said as the music from the orchestra in a theatre
                    heightens the effect without interrupting the words of the actor on the stage.</p>
                <p>"It is strange," said Miss Morris. "I should have thought you were a man who
                    would care very much and in just the right way. But I don't believe really
                    &mdash; I'm sorry, but I don't believe you do know what love means at all."</p>
                <p>"Oh, it isn't as bad as that," said Carlton. "I think I know what it is, and what
                    it means to other people, but I can't feel it myself. The best idea I ever got
                    of it &mdash; the thing that made it clear to me &mdash; was a line in a
                    play. It seemed to express it better than any of the love-poems I ever read. It
                    was in <hi rend="italic">Shenandoah</hi>."</p>
                <p>Miss Morris laughed.</p>
                <p>"I beg your pardon," said Carlton.</p>
                <p>"I beg yours," she said. "It was only the incongruity that struck me. It seemed
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0133" n="104"/> so odd to be quoting <hi
                        rend="italic">Shenandoah</hi> here in the Dardanelles, with these queer
                    people below us and ancient Troy on one hand &mdash; it took me by surprise,
                    that's all. Please go on. What was it impressed you?"</p>
                <p>"Well, the hero in the play," said Carlton, is an officer in the Northern army,
                    and he is lying wounded in a house near the Shenandoah Valley. The girl he loves
                    lives in this house, and is nursing him; but she doesn't love him, because she
                    sympathizes with the South. At least she says she doesn't love him. Both armies
                    are forming in the valley below to begin the battle, and he sees his own
                    regiment hurrying past to join them, So he gets up and staggers out on the
                    stage, which is set to show the yard in front of the farm-house, and he calls
                    for his horse to follow his men. Then the girl runs out and begs him not to go;
                    and he asks why, what does it matter to her whether he goes or not? And she
                    says, <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0134" n="105"/> `But I cannot let you go; you
                    may be killed.' And he says again, `What is that to you?' And she says: `It is
                    everything to me. I love you.' And he makes a grab at her with his wounded arm,
                    and at that instant both armies open fire in the valley below, and the whole
                    earth and sky seem to open and shut, and the house rocks. The girl rushes at him
                    and crowds up against his breast, and cries: `What is that? Oh, what is that?'
                    and he holds her tight to him and laughs, and says: `<hi rend="italic"
                    >That?</hi> That's only a battle &mdash; you love me.'"</p>
                <p>Miss Morris looked steadfastly over the side of the boat at the waters rushing by
                    beneath, smiling to herself. Then she turned her face towards Carlton, and
                    nodded her head at him. "I think," she said, dryly, "that you have a fair idea
                    of what it means; a rough working-plan at least &mdash; enough to begin on."</p>
                <p>"I said that I knew what it meant to <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0135" n="106"/>
                    others. I am complaining that I cannot feel it myself."</p>
                <p>"That will come in time, no doubt," she said, encouragingly, with the air of a
                    connoisseur; "and let me tell you," she added, "that it will be all the better
                    for the woman that you have doubted yourself so long."</p>
                <p>"You think so?" said Carlton, eagerly.</p>
                <p>Miss Morris laughed at his earnestness, and left him to go below to ask her aunt
                    to join them, but Mrs. Downs preferred to read in the saloon, and Miss Morris
                    returned alone. She had taken off her Eton jacket and pulled on a heavy blue
                    football sweater, and over this a reefer. The jersey clung to her and showed the
                    lines of her figure, and emphasized the freedom and grace with which she made
                    every movement. She looked, as she walked at his side with her hands in the
                    pockets of her coat and with a flat sailor hat on her head, like a tall,
                    handsome <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0136" n="107"/> boy; but when they stopped
                    and stood where the light fell full on her hair and the exquisite coloring of
                    her skin, Carlton thought her face had never seemed so delicate or fair as it
                    did then, rising from the collar of the rough jersey, and contrasted with the
                    hat and coat of a man's attire. They paced the deck for an hour later, until
                    every one else had left it, and at midnight were still loath to give up the
                    beautiful night and the charm of their strange surroundings. There were long
                    silent places in their talk, during which Carlton tramped beside her with his
                    head half turned, looking at her and noting with an artist's eye the free light
                    step, the erect carriage, and the unconscious beauty of her face. The captain of
                    the steamer joined them after midnight, and falling into step, pointed out to
                    Miss Morris where great cities had stood, where others lay buried, and where
                    beyond the hills were the almost inaccessible monasteries <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0137" n="108"/> of the Greek Church. The moonlight
                    turned the banks into shadowy substances, in which the ghosts of former days
                    seemed to make a part; and spurred by the young girl's interest, the Italian, to
                    entertain her, called up all the legends of mythology and the stories of Roman
                    explorers and Turkish conquerors.</p>
                <p>"I turn in now," he said, after Miss Morris had left them. "A most charming young
                    lady. Is it not so?" he added, waving his cigarette in a gesture which expressed
                    the ineffectiveness of the adjective.</p>
                <p>"Yes, very," said Carlton. "Good-night, sir."</p>
                <p>He turned, and leaned with both elbows on the rail, and looked out at the misty
                    banks, puffing at his cigar. Then he dropped it hissing into the water, and,
                    stifling a yawn, looked up and down the length of the deserted deck. It seemed
                    particularly bare and empty.</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0138" n="109"/>
                <p>What a pity she's engaged!" Carlton said. "She loses so much by it."</p>
                <p>They steamed slowly into the harbor of the Pir&aelig;us at an early hour the
                    next morning, with a flotilla of small boats filled with shrieking porters and
                    hotel-runners at the sides. These men tossed their painters to the crew, and
                    crawled up them like a boarding crew of pirates, running wildly about the deck,
                    and laying violent hands on any piece of baggage they saw unclaimed. The
                    passengers' trunks had been thrown out in a heap on the deck, and Nolan and
                    Carlton were clambering over them, looking for their own effects, while Miss
                    Morris stood below, as far out of the confusion as she could place herself, and
                    pointed out the different pieces that belonged to her. As she stood there one of
                    the hotel-runners, a burly, greasy Levantine in pursuit of a possible victim,
                    shouldered her intentionally and roughly out of the way. He shoved <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0139" n="110"/> her so sharply that she lost her
                    balance and fell back against the rail. Carlton saw what had happened, and made
                    a flying leap from the top of the pile of trunks, landing beside her, and in
                    time to seize the escaping offender by the collar. He jerked him back off his
                    feet.</p>
                <p>"How dare you &mdash; " he began.</p>
                <p>But he did not finish. He felt the tips of Miss Morris's fingers laid upon his
                    shoulder, and her voice saying, in an annoyed tone: "Don't; please don't." And,
                    to his surprise, his fingers lost their grip on the man's shirt, his arms
                    dropped at his side, and his blood began to flow calmly again through his veins.
                    Carlton was aware that he had a very quick temper. He was always engaging in
                    street rows, as he called them, with men who he thought had imposed on him or on
                    some one else, and though he was always ashamed of himself later, his temper had
                    never been satisfied <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0140" n="111"/> without a blow
                    or an apology. Women had also touched him before, and possibly with a greater
                    familiarity; but these had stirred him, not quieted him; and men who had laid
                    detaining hands on him had had them beaten down for their pains. But this girl
                    had merely touched him gently, and he had been made helpless. It was most
                    perplexing; and while the custom-house officials were passing his luggage, he
                    found himself rubbing his arm curiously, as though it were numb, and looking
                    down at it with an amused smile. He did not comment on the incident, although he
                    smiled at the recollection of his prompt obedience several times during the day.
                    But as he was stepping into the cab to drive to Athens, he saw the offending
                    ruffian pass, dripping with water, and muttering bitter curses. When he saw
                    Carlton he disappeared instantly in the crowd. Carlton stepped over to where
                    Nolan sat beside the <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0141" n="112"/> driver on the
                    box. "Nolan," he said, in a low voice, "isn't that the fellow who &mdash; "</p>
                <p>"Yes, sir," said Nolan, touching his hat gravely. "He was pulling a valise one
                    way, and the gentleman that owned it, sir, was pulling it the other, and the
                    gentleman let go sudden, and the Italian went over backwards off the pier."</p>
                <p>Carlton smiled grimly with secret satisfaction.</p>
                <p>"Nolan," he said, "you're not telling the truth. You did it yourself." Nolan
                    touched his cap and coughed consciously. There had been no detaining fingers on
                    Nolan's arm.</p>

                <p>You are coming now, Miss Morris," exclaimed Carlton from the front of the
                    carriage in which they were moving along the sunny road to Athens, "into a land
                    where one restores his lost illusions. Anybody who wishes to get back his belief
                    in beautiful things should come here to do it, just as he would go to a German
                    sanitarium to build up his nerves or his appetite. You have only to drink in the
                    atmosphere and you are cured. I know no better antidote than Athens for a siege
                    of cable-cars and muddy asphalt pavements and a course of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Robert Elsmeres</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Heavenly Twins</hi>. Wait
                    until you see the statues of the young athletes in the Museum," he cried,
                    enthusiastically, "and get a glimpse of the blue <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0143" n="114"/> sky back of Mount Hymettus, and the
                    moonlight some evening on the Acropolis, and you'll be convinced that nothing
                    counts for much in this world but health and straight limbs, and tall marble
                    pillars, and eyes trained to see only what is beautiful. Give people a love for
                    beauty and a respect for health, Miss Morris, and the result is going to be,
                    what they once had here, the best art and the greatest writers and satirists and
                    poets. The same audience that applauded Euripides and Sophocles in the open
                    theatre used to cross the road the same day to applaud the athletes who ran
                    naked in the Olympian games, and gave them as great honor. I came here once on a
                    walking tour with a chap who wasn't making as much of himself as he should have
                    done, and he went away a changed man, and became a personage in the world, and
                    you would never guess what it was that did it. He saw a statue of one <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0144" n="115"/> of the Greek gods in the Museum which
                    showed certain muscles that he couldn't find in his own body, and he told me he
                    was going to train down until they did show; and he stopped drinking and loafing
                    to do it, and took to exercising and working; and by the time the muscles showed
                    out clear and strong he was so keen over life that he wanted to make the most of
                    it, and, as I said, he has done it. That's what a respect for his own body did
                    for him."</p>
                <p>The carriage stopped at the hotel on one side of the public square of Athens,
                    with the palace and its gardens blocking one end, and yellow houses with red
                    roofs, and gay awnings over the cafes, surrounding it. It was a bright sunny
                    day, and the city was clean and cool and pretty.</p>
                <p>"Breakfast?" exclaimed Miss Morris, in answer to Carlton's inquiry; "yes, I
                    suppose so, but I won't feel safe until I have my feet on that rock." She was
                    standing <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0145" n="116"/> on the steps of the hotel,
                    looking up with expectant, eager eyes at the great Acropolis above the city.</p>
                <p>"It has been there for a long time now," suggested Carlton, "and I think you can
                    risk its being there for a half-hour longer."</p>
                <p>"Well," she said, reluctantly, "but I don't wish to lose this chance. There might
                    be an earthquake, for instance."</p>
                <p>"We are likely to see <hi rend="italic">them</hi> this morning," said Carlton, as
                    he left the hotel with the ladies and drove towards the Acropolis. "Nolan has
                    been interviewing the English maid, and she tells him they spend the greater
                    part of their time up there on the rock. They are living very simply here, as
                    they did in Paris; that is, for the present. On Wednesday the King gives a
                    dinner and a reception in their honor."</p>
                <p>"When does your dinner come off asked Miss Morris. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0146" n="117"/>
                <p>"Never," said Carlton, grimly.</p>
                <p>"One of the reasons why I like to come back to Athens so much," said Mrs. Downs,
                    "is because there are so few other tourists here to spoil the local color for
                    you, and there are almost as few guides as tourists, so that you can wander
                    around undisturbed and discover things for yourself. They don't label every
                    fallen column, and place fences around the temples. They seem to put you on your
                    good behavior. Then I always like to go to a place where you are as much of a
                    curiosity to the people as they are to you. It seems to excuse your staring
                    about you."</p>
                <p>"A curiosity!" exclaimed Carlton; "I should say so! The last time I was here I
                    tried to wear a pair of knickerbockers around the city, and the people stared so
                    that I had to go back to the hotel and change them. I shouldn't have minded it
                    so much in any other country, but I <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0147" n="118"/>
                    thought men who wore Jaeger underclothing and women's petticoats for a national
                    costume might have excused so slight an eccentricity as knickerbockers. <hi
                        rend="italic">They</hi> had no right to throw the first stone."</p>
                <p>The rock upon which the temples of the Acropolis are built is more of a hill than
                    a rock. It is much steeper upon one side than the other, with a sheer fall a
                    hundred yards broad; on the opposite side there are the rooms of the Hospital of
                    Aesculapius and the theatres of Dionysus and Herodes Atticus. The top of the
                    rock holds the Parthenon and the other smaller temples, or what yet remains of
                    them, and its surface is littered with broken marble and stones and pieces of
                    rock. The top is so closely built over that the few tourists who visit it can
                    imagine themselves its sole occupants for a half-hour at a time. When Carlton
                    and his friends arrived, the place appeared quite deserted. They left the
                    carriage <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0148" n="119"/> at the base of the rock, and
                    climbed up to the entrance on foot.</p>
                <p>"Now, before I go on to the Parthenon," said Miss Morris, "I want to walk around
                    the sides, and see what is there. I shall begin with that theatre to the left,
                    and I warn you that I mean to take my time about it. So you people who have been
                    here before can run along by yourselves, but I mean to enjoy it leisurely. I am
                    safe by myself here, am I not?" she asked.</p>
                <p>"As safe as though you were in the Metropolitan Museum," said Carlton, as he and
                    Mrs. Downs followed Miss Morris along the side of the hill towards the ruined
                    theatre of Herodes, and stood at its top, looking down into the basin below.
                    From their feet ran a great semicircle of marble seats, descending tier below
                    tier to a marble pavement, and facing a great ruined wall of pillars and arches
                    which in <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0149" n="120"/> the past had formed the
                    background for the actors. From the height on which they stood above the city
                    they could see the green country stretching out for miles on every side and
                    swimming in the warm sunlight, the dark groves of myrtle on the hills, the
                    silver ribbon of the inland water, and the dark blue &AElig;gean Sea. The
                    bleating of sheep and the tinkling of the bells came up to them from the
                    pastures below, and they imagined they could hear the shepherds piping to their
                    flocks from one little hill-top to another.</p>
                <p>"The country is not much changed," said Carlton, "And when you stand where we are
                    now, you can imagine that you see the procession winding its way over the road
                    to the Eleusinian Mysteries, with the gilded chariots, and the children carrying
                    garlands, and the priestesses leading the bulls for the sacrifice."</p>
                <p>What can we imagine is going on <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0150" n="121"/> here?"
                    said Miss Morris, pointing with her parasol to the theatre below.</p>
                <p>"Oh, this is much later," said Carlton. "This was built by the Romans. They used
                    to act and to hold their public meetings here. This corresponds to the top row
                    of our gallery, and you can imagine that you are looking down on the bent backs
                    of hundreds of bald-headed men in white robes, listening to the speakers
                    strutting about below there."</p>
                <p>"I wonder how much they could hear from this height?" said Mrs. Downs.</p>
                <p>"Well, they had that big wall for a sounding-board, and the air is so soft here
                    that their voices should have carried easily, and I believe they wore masks with
                    mouth-pieces, that conveyed the sound like a fireman's trumpet. If you like, I
                    will run down there and call up to you, and you can hear how it sounded. I will
                    speak in my natural voice first, and if <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0151" n="122"
                    /> that doesn't reach you, wave your parasol, and I will try it a little
                    louder."</p>
                <p>"Oh, do!" said Miss Morris. "It will be very good of you. I should like to hear a
                    real speech in the theatre of Herodes," she said, as she seated herself on the
                    edge of the marble crater.</p>
                <p>"I'll have to speak in English," said Carlton, as he disappeared; "my Greek isn't
                    good enough to carry that far."</p>
                <p>Mrs. Downs seated herself beside her niece, and Carlton began scrambling down the
                    side of the amphitheatre. The marble benches were broken in parts, and where
                    they were perfect were covered with a fine layer of moss as smooth and soft as
                    green velvet, so that Carlton, when he was not laboriously feeling for his next
                    foothold with the toe of his boot, was engaged in picking spring flowers from
                    the beds of moss and sticking them, for safe-keeping, in his button-hole. He was
                    several minutes in making <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0152" n="123"/> the
                    descent, and so busily occupied in doing it that he did not look up until he had
                    reached the level of the ground, and jumped lightly from the first row of seats
                    to the stage, covered with moss, which lay like a heavy rug over the marble
                    pavement. When he did look up he saw a tableau that made his heart, which was
                    beating quickly from the exertion of the descent, stand still with
                    consternation. The Hohenwalds had, in his short absence, descended from the
                    entrance of the Acropolis, and had stopped on their way to the road below to
                    look into the cool green and white basin of the theatre. At the moment Carlton
                    looked up the Duke was standing in front of Mrs. Downs and Miss Morris, and all
                    of the men had their hats off. Then, in pantomime, and silhouetted against the
                    blue sky behind them, Carlton saw the Princesses advance beside their brother,
                    and Mrs. Downs and her niece courtesied three times, and then the whole party
                    faced about <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0153" n="124"/> in a line and looked down
                    at him. The meaning of the tableau was only too plain.</p>
                <p>"Good heavens!" gasped Carlton. "Everybody's getting introduced to everybody
                    else, and I've missed the whole thing! If they think I'm going to stay down here
                    and amuse them, and miss all the fun myself, they are greatly mistaken." He made
                    a mad rush for the front first row of seats; but there was a cry of remonstrance
                    from above, and, looking up, he saw all of the men waving him back.</p>
                <p>"Speech!" cried the young English Captain, applauding loudly, as though welcoming
                    an actor on his first entrance. "Hats off!" he cried. "Down in front! Speech!"</p>
                <p>"Confound that ass!" said Carlton, dropping back to the marble pavement again,
                    and gazing impotently up at the row of figures outlined against the sky. "I must
                    look like a bear in the bear-pit at the Zoo," he growled. "They'll be throwing
                    buns to <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0154" n="125"/> me next." He could see the
                    two elder sisters talking to Mrs. Downs, who was evidently explaining his
                    purpose in going down to the stage of the theatre, and he could see the Princess
                    Aline bending forward, with both hands on her parasol, and smiling. The captain
                    made a trumpet of his hands, and asked why be didn't begin.</p>
                <p>"Hello! how are you?" Carlton called back, waving his hat at him in some
                    embarrassment. "I wonder if I look as much like a fool as I feel?" he muttered.</p>
                <p>"What did you say? We can't hear you," answered the captain.</p>
                <p>"Louder! louder!" called the equerries. Carlton swore at them under his breath,
                    and turned and gazed round the hole in which he was penned in order to make them
                    believe that he had given up the idea of making a speech, or had ever intended
                    doing so. He tried to think of something clever to shout back at them, and
                    rejected "Ye men <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0155" n="126"/> of Athens" as being
                    too flippant, and Friends, Countrymen, Romans," as requiring too much effort.
                    When he looked up again the Hohenwalds were moving on their way, and as he
                    started once more to scale the side of the theatre the Duke waved his hand at
                    him in farewell, and gave another hand to his sisters, who disappeared with him
                    behind the edge of the upper row of seats. Carlton turned at once and dropped
                    into one of the marble chairs and bowed his head. When he did reach the top Miss
                    Morris held out a sympathetic hand to him and shook her head sadly, but he could
                    see that she was pressing her lips tightly together to keep from smiling.</p>
                <p>"Oh, it's all very funny for you," he said, refusing her hand. "I don't believe
                    you are in love with anybody. You don't know what it means."</p>
                <p>They revisited the rock on the next day and on the day after, and then left
                    Athens <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0156" n="127"/> for an inland excursion to
                    stay overnight. Miss Morris returned from it with the sense of having done her
                    duty once, and by so doing having earned the right to act as she pleased in the
                    future. What she best pleased to do was to wander about over the broad top of
                    the Acropolis, with no serious intent of studying its historical values, but
                    rather, as she explained it, for the simple satisfaction of feeling that she was
                    there. She liked to stand on the edge of the low wall along its top and look out
                    over the picture of sea and plain and mountains that lay below her. The sun
                    shone brightly, and the wind swept by them as though they were on the bridge of
                    an ocean steamer, and there was the added invigorating sense of pleasure that
                    comes to us when we stand on a great height. Carlton was sitting at her feet,
                    shielded from the wind by a fallen column, and gazing up at her with critical
                    approval.</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0157" n="128"/>
                <p>"You look like a sort of a `Winged Victory' up there," he said, "with the wind
                    blowing your skirts about and your hair coming down."</p>
                <p>"I don't remember that the `Winged Victory' has any hair to blow about,"
                    suggested Miss Morris.</p>
                <p>"I'd like to paint you," continued Carlton, "just as you are standing now, only I
                    would put you in a Greek dress; and you could stand a Greek dress better than
                    almost any one I know. I would paint you with your head up and one hand
                    shielding your eyes, and the other pressed against your breast. It would be
                    stunning." He spoke enthusiastically, but in quite an impersonal tone, as though
                    he were discussing the posing of a model.</p>
                <p>Miss Morris jumped down from the low wall on which she had been standing, and
                    said, simply, "Of course I should like to have you paint me very much."</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0158" n="129"/>
                <p>Mrs. Downs looked up with interest to see if Mr. Carlton was serious.</p>
                <p>"When?" said Carlton, vaguely. "Oh, I don't know. Of course this is entirely too
                    nice to last, and you will be going home soon, and then when I do get back to
                    the States you will &mdash; you will have other things to do."</p>
                <p>"Yes," repeated Miss Morris, "I shall have something else to do besides gazing
                    out at the &AElig;gean Sea." She raised her head and looked across the rock
                    for a moment with some interest. Her eyes, which had grown wistful, lighted
                    again with amusement. "Here are your friends," she said, smiling.</p>
                <p>"No!" exclaimed Carlton, scrambling to his feet.</p>
                <p>"Yes," said Miss Morris. "The Duke has seen us, and is coming over here."</p>
                <p>When Carlton had gained his feet and turned to look, his friends had separated in
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0159" n="130"/> different directions, and were
                    strolling about alone or in pairs among the great columns of the Parthenon. But
                    the Duke came directly towards them, and seated himself on a low block of marble
                    in front of the two ladies. After a word or two about the beauties of the place,
                    he asked if they would go to the reception which the King gave to him on the day
                    following. They answered that they should like to come very much, and the Prince
                    expressed his satisfaction, and said that he would see that the chamberlain sent
                    them invitations. "And you, Mr. Carlton, you will come also, I hope. I wish you
                    to be presented to my sisters. They are only amateurs in art, but they are great
                    admirers of your work, and they have rebuked me for not having already presented
                    you. We were all disappointed," he continued, courteously, "at not having you to
                    dine with us that night in Constantinople, but now I trust I shall see something
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0160" n="131"/> of you here. You must tell us
                    what we are to admire."</p>
                <p>"That is very easy," said Carlton. "Everything."</p>
                <p>"You are quite right," said the Prince, bowing to the ladies as he moved away. It
                    is all very beautiful."</p>
                <p>"Well, now you certainly will meet her," said Miss Morris.</p>
                <p>"Oh no, I won't," said Carlton, with resignation. "I have had two chances and
                    lost them, and I'll miss this one too."</p>
                <p>"Well, there is a chance you shouldn't miss," said Miss Morris, pointing and
                    nodding her head. "There she is now, and all alone. She's sketching, isn't she,
                    or taking notes? What is she doing?"</p>
                <p>Carlton looked eagerly in the direction Miss Morris had signified, and saw the
                    Princess Aline sitting at some distance from them, with a book on her lap. She
                    glanced up from this now and again to look <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0161"
                        n="132"/> at something ahead of her, and was apparently deeply absorbed in
                    her occupation.</p>
                <p>"There is your opportunity," said Mrs. Downs; "and we are going back to the
                    hotel. Shall we see you at luncheon?"</p>
                <p>"Yes," said Carlton, "unless I get a position as drawing-master; in that case I
                    shall be here teaching the three amateurs in art. Do you think I can do it?" he
                    asked Miss Morris.</p>
                <p>"Decidedly," she answered. "I have found you a most educational young person."</p>
                <p>They went away together, and Carlton moved cautiously towards the spot where the
                    Princess was sitting. He made a long and roundabout detour as he did so, in
                    order to keep himself behind her. He did not mean to come so near that she would
                    see him, but he took a certain satisfaction in looking at her when she was
                    alone, though her loneliness was only a matter of <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0162" />
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0163" />
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0164" n="133"/> the moment, and though he knew that
                    her people were within a hundred yards of her. He was in consequence somewhat
                    annoyed and surprised to see another young man dodging in and out among the
                    pillars of the Parthenon immediately ahead of him, and to find that this young
                    man also had his attention centred on the young girl, who sat unconsciously
                    sketching in the foreground.</p>
                <p>"Now what the devil can he want?" muttered Carlton, his imagination taking alarm
                    at once. "If it would only prove to be some one who meant harm to her," he
                    thought &mdash; "a brigand, or a beggar, who might be obligingly insolent,
                    or even a tipsy man, what a chance it would afford for heroic action!"</p>
                <p>With this hope he moved forward quickly but silently, hoping that the stranger
                    might prove even to be an anarchist with a grudge against royalty. And as he
                    advanced he <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0165" n="134"/> had the satisfaction of
                    seeing the Princess glance over her shoulder, and, observing the man, rise and
                    walk quickly away towards the edge of the rock. There she seated herself with
                    her face towards the city, and with her back firmly set against her pursuer.</p>
                <p>" He <hi rend="italic">is</hi> annoying her!" exclaimed Carlton, delightedly, as
                    he hurried forward. "It looks as though my chance had come at last." But as he
                    approached the stranger he saw, to his great disappointment, that he had nothing
                    more serious to deal with than one of the international army of amateur
                    photographers, who had been stalking the Princess as a hunter follows an elk, or
                    as he would have stalked a race-horse or a prominent politician, or a Lord
                    Mayor's show, everything being fish that came within the focus of his camera. A
                    helpless statue and an equally helpless young girl were both good subjects and
                    at his mercy. He was bending over, with an anxious expression of <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0166" n="135"/> countenance, and focussing his camera
                    on the back of the Princess Aline, when Carlton approached from the rear. As the
                    young man put his finger on the button of the camera, Carlton jogged his arm
                    with his elbow, and pushed the enthusiastic tourist to one side.</p>
                <p>"say," exclaimed that individual, "look where you're going, will you? You spoiled
                    that plate."</p>
                <p>"I'll spoil your camera if you annoy that young lady any longer," said Carlton,
                    in a low voice.</p>
                <p>The photographer was rapidly rewinding his roll, and the fire of pursuit was
                    still in his eye.</p>
                <p>"She's a Princess," he explained, in an excited whisper.</p>
                <p>"Well," said Carlton, "even a Princess is entitled to some consideration.
                    Besides," he said, in a more amicable tone, "you haven't a permit to photograph
                    on the <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0167" n="136"/> Acropolis. You know you
                    haven't." Carlton was quite sure of this, because there were no such permits.</p>
                <p>The amateur looked up in some dismay. I didn't know you had to have them," he
                    said. "Where can I get one?"</p>
                <p>"The King may give you one," said Carlton. "He lives at the palace. If they catch
                    you up here without a license, they will confiscate your camera and lock you up.
                    You had better vanish before they see you."</p>
                <p>"Thank you. I will," said the tourist, anxiously.</p>
                <p>"Now," thought Carlton, smiling pleasantly, "when he goes to the palace with that
                    box and asks for a permit, they'll think he is either a dynamiter or a crank,
                    and before they are through with him his interest in photography will have
                    sustained a severe shock."</p>
                <p>As Carlton turned from watching the rapid flight of the photographer, he observed
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0168" n="137"/> that the Princess had remarked it
                    also, as she had no doubt been a witness of what had passed, even if she had not
                    overheard all that had been said. She rose from her enforced position of refuge
                    with a look of relief, and came directly towards Carlton along the rough path
                    that led through the debris on the top of the Acropolis. Carlton had thought, as
                    he watched her sitting on the wall, with her chin resting on her hand, that she
                    would make a beautiful companion picture to the one he had wished to paint of
                    Miss Morris &mdash; the one girl standing upright, looking fearlessly out to
                    sea, on the top of the low wall, with the wind blowing her skirts about her, and
                    her hair tumbled in the breeze, and the other seated, bending intently forward,
                    as though watching for the return of a long-delayed vessel; a beautifully sad
                    face, fine and delicate and noble, the face of a girl on the figure of a woman.
                    And when she rose he made no effort to <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0169" n="138"
                    /> move away, or, indeed, to pretend not to have seen her, but stood looking at
                    her as though he had the right to do so, and as though she must know he had that
                    right. As she came towards him the Princess Aline did not stop, nor even shorten
                    her steps; but as she passed opposite to him she bowed her thanks with a sweet
                    impersonal smile and a dropping of the eyes, and continued steadily on her way.</p>
                <p>Carlton stood for some short time looking after her, with his hat still at his
                    side. She seemed farther from him at that moment than she had ever been before,
                    although she had for the first time recognized him. But he knew that it was only
                    as a human being that she had recognized him. He put on his hat, and sat down on
                    a rock with his elbows on his knees, and filled his pipe.</p>
                <p>"If that had been any other girl," he thought, "I would have gone up to her and
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0170" />
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0171" />
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0172" n="139"/> said, `Was that man annoying you?'
                    and she would have said, `Yes; thank you,' or something; and I would have walked
                    along with her until we had come up to her friends, and she would have told them
                    I had been of some slight service to her, and they would have introduced us, and
                    all would have gone well. But because she is a Princess she cannot be approached
                    in that way. At least she does not think so, and I have to act as she has been
                    told I should act, and not as I think I should. After all, she is only a very
                    beautiful girl, and she must be very tired of her cousins and grandmothers, and
                    of not being allowed to see any one else. These royalties make a very
                    picturesque show for the rest of us, but indeed it seems rather hard on them. A
                    hundred years from now there will be no more kings and queens, and the writers
                    of that day will envy us, just as the writers of this day envy the men who wrote
                    of chivalry and tournaments, <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0173" n="140"/> and they will have to choose their
                    heroes from bank presidents, and their heroines from lady lawyers and girl
                    politicians and type-writers. What a stupid world it will be then!"</p>
                <p>The next day brought the reception to the Hohenwalds; and Carlton, entering the
                    reading-room of the hotel on the same afternoon, found Miss Morris and her aunt
                    there together taking tea. They both looked at him with expressions of such
                    genuine commiseration that he stopped just as he was going to seat himself and
                    eyed them defiantly.</p>
                <p>"Don't tell me," he exclaimed, "that this has fallen through too!"</p>
                <p>Miss Morris nodded her head silently.</p>
                <p>Carlton dropped into the chair beside them, and folded his arms with a frown of
                    grim resignation. "What is it?" he asked. Have they postponed the reception?"</p>
                <p>"No," Miss Morris said; "but the Princess Aline will not be there."</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0174" n="141"/>
                <p>Of course not," said Carlton, calmly, "of course not. May I ask why? I knew that
                    she wouldn't be there, but I may possibly be allowed to express some curiosity."</p>
                <p>"She turned her ankle on one of the loose stones on the Acropolis this
                    afternoon," said Miss Morris, "and sprained it so badly that they had to carry
                    her &mdash; "</p>
                <p>"Who carried her?" Carlton demanded, fiercely.</p>
                <p>"Some of her servants."</p>
                <p>"Of course, of course!" cried Carlton.</p>
                <p>That's the way it always will be. I was there the whole afternoon, and I didn't
                    see her. I wasn't there to help her. It's Fate, that's what it is &mdash;
                    Fate! There's no use in my trying to fight against Fate. Still," he added,
                    anxiously, with a sudden access of hope, "she may be well by this evening."</p>
                <p>"I hardly think she will," said Miss Morris, "but we will trust so."</p>
                <p>The King's palace and gardens stretch <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0175" n="142"/>
                    along one end of the public park, and are but just across the street from the
                    hotel where the Hohenwalds and the Americans were staying. As the hotel was the
                    first building on the left of the square, Carlton could see from his windows the
                    illuminations, and the guards of honor, and the carriages arriving and
                    departing, and the citizens of Athens crowding the parks and peering through the
                    iron rails into the King's garden. It was a warm night, and lighted grandly by a
                    full moon that showed the Acropolis in silhouette against the sky, and gave a
                    strangely theatrical look to the yellow house fronts and red roofs of the town.
                    Every window in the broad front of the palace was illuminated, and through the
                    open doors came the sound of music, and one without could see rows of tall
                    servants in the King's blue and white livery, and the men of his guard in their
                    white petticoats and black and white jackets and red caps. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0176" n="143"/> Carlton pulled a light coat over his
                    evening dress, and, with an agitation he could hardly explain, walked across the
                    street and entered the palace. The line of royalties had broken by the time he
                    reached the ballroom, and the not over-severe etiquette of the Greek court left
                    him free, after a bow to those who still waited to receive it, to move about as
                    he pleased. His most earnest desire was to learn whether or not the Princess
                    Aline was present, and with that end he clutched the English adjutant as that
                    gentleman was hurrying past him, and asked eagerly if the Princess had recovered
                    from her accident.</p>
                <p>"No," said the officer; "she's able to walk about, but not to stand, and sit out
                    a dinner, and dance, and all this sort of thing. Too bad, wasn't it?"</p>
                <p>"Yes," said Carlton, "very bad." He released his hand from the other's arm, and
                    dropped back among the men grouped <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0177" n="144"/>
                    about the doorway. His disappointment was very keen. Indeed, he had not known
                    how much this meeting with the Princess had meant to him until he experienced
                    this disappointment, which was succeeded by a wish to find Miss Morris, and have
                    her sympathize and laugh with him. He became conscious, as he searched with
                    growing impatience the faces of those passing and repassing before him, of how
                    much the habit of going to Miss Morris for sympathy in his unlucky love-affair
                    had grown of late upon him. He wondered what he would have done in his travels
                    without her, and whether he should have had the interest to carry on his pursuit
                    had she not been there to urge him on, and to mock at him when he grew
                    fainthearted.</p>
                <p>But when he finally did discover her he stood quite still, and for an instant
                    doubted if it were she. The girl he saw seemed to be a more beautiful sister of
                    the Miss Morris <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0178" n="145"/> he knew &mdash; a
                    taller, fairer, and more radiant personage; and he feared that it was not she,
                    until he remembered that this was the first time he had ever seen her with her
                    hair dressed high upon her head, and in the more distinguished accessories of a
                    d&eacute;collet&eacute; gown and train. Miss Morris had her hand on the
                    arm of one of the equerries, who was battling good-naturedly with the crowd, and
                    trying to draw her away from two persistent youths in diplomatic uniform who
                    were laughing and pressing forward in close pursuit on the other side. Carlton
                    approached her with a certain feeling of diffidence, which was most unusual to
                    him, and asked if she were dancing.</p>
                <p>"Mr. Carlton shall decide for me," Miss Morris said, dropping the equerry's arm
                    and standing beside the American. "I have promised all of these gentlemen," she
                    explained, "to dance with them, and now they won't agree as to which is to dance
                    first. <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0179" n="146"/> They've wasted half this waltz
                    already in discussing it, and they make it much more difficult by saying that no
                    matter how I decide, they will fight duels with the one I choose, which is most
                    unpleasant for me.</p>
                <p>"Most unpleasant for the gentleman you choose, too," suggested Carlton.</p>
                <p>"So," continued Miss Morris, "I have decided to leave it to you."</p>
                <p>"Well, if I am to arbitrate between the powers," said Carlton, with a glance at
                    the three uniforms, "my decision is that as they insist on fighting duels in any
                    event, you had better dance with me until they have settled it between them, and
                    then the survivor can have the next dance."</p>
                <p>"That's a very good idea," said Miss Morris; and taking Carlton's arm, she bowed
                    to the three men and drew away.</p>
                <p>"Mr. Carlton," said the equerry, with a bow," has added another argument in favor
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0180" n="147"/> of maintaining standing armies,
                    and of not submitting questions to arbitration."</p>
                <p>"Let's get out of this," said Carlton. "You don't want to dance, do you? Let us
                    go where it's cool."</p>
                <p>He led her down the stairs, and out on to the terrace. They did not speak again
                    until they had left it, and were walking under the trees in the Queen's garden.
                    He had noticed as they made their way through the crowd how the men and women
                    turned to look at her and made way for her, and how utterly unconscious she was
                    of their doing so, with that unconsciousness which comes from familiarity with
                    such discrimination, and Carlton himself held his head a little higher with the
                    pride and pleasure the thought gave him that he was in such friendly sympathy
                    with so beautiful a creature. He stopped before a low stone bench that stood on
                    the edge of the path, surrounded by a screen of tropical trees, and <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0181" n="148"/> guarded by a marble statue. They were
                    in deep shadow themselves, but the moonlight fell on the path at their feet, and
                    through the trees on the other side of the path they could see the open terrace
                    of the palace, with the dancers moving in and out of the lighted windows. The
                    splash of a fountain came from some short distance behind them, and from time to
                    time they heard the strains of a regimental band alternating with the softer
                    strains of a waltz played by a group of Hungarian musicians. For a moment
                    neither of them spoke, but sat watching the white dresses of the women and the
                    uniforms of the men moving in and out among the trees, lighted by the lanterns
                    hanging from the branches, and the white mist of the moon.</p>
                <p>"Do you know," said Carlton, "I'm rather afraid of you to-night!" He paused, and
                    watched her for a little time as she sat upright, with her hands folded on her
                    lap.</p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0182" />
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0183" />
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0184" n="149"/>
                <p>"You are so very resplendent and queenly and altogether different," he added. The
                    girl moved her bare shoulders slightly and leaned back against the bench.</p>
                <p>"The Princess did not come," she said.</p>
                <p>"No," Carlton answered, with a sudden twinge of conscience at having forgotten
                    that fact. "That's one of the reasons I took you away from those men," he
                    explained. "I wanted you to sympathize with me."</p>
                <p>Miss Morris did not answer him at once. She did not seem to be in a sympathetic
                    mood. Her manner suggested rather that she was tired and troubled.</p>
                <p>"I need sympathy myself to-night," she said. "We received a letter after dinner
                    that brought bad news for us. We must go home at once."</p>
                <p>"Bad news!" exclaimed Carlton, with much concern. "From home?"</p>
                <p>"Yes, from home," she replied; "but there is nothing wrong there; it is only bad
                    news <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0185" n="150"/> for us. My sister has decided to
                    be married in June instead of July, and that cuts us out of a month on the
                    Continent. That's all. We shall have to leave immediately &mdash; tomorrow.
                    It seems that Mr. Abbey is able to go away sooner than he had hoped, and they
                    are to be married on the first."</p>
                <p>"Mr. Abbey!" exclaimed Carlton, catching at the name. "But your sister isn't
                    going to marry him, is she?"</p>
                <p>Miss Morris turned her head in some surprise. "Yes &mdash; why not?" she
                    said.</p>
                <p>"But I say!" cried Carlton, "I thought your aunt told me that <hi rend="italic"
                        >you</hi> were going to marry Abbey; she told me so that day on the steamer
                    when he came to see you off."</p>
                <p>"I marry him &mdash; my aunt told you &mdash; impossible!" said Miss
                    Morris, smiling. "She probably said that `her niece' was going to marry him; she
                    meant my sister. They had been engaged some time."</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0186" n="151"/>
                <p>"Then who are <hi rend="italic">you</hi> going to marry?" stammered Carlton.</p>
                <p>"I am not going to marry any one," said Miss Morris.</p>
                <p>Carlton stared at her blankly in amazement. Well, that's most absurd!" he
                    exclaimed.</p>
                <p>He recognized instantly that the expression was hardly adequate, but he could not
                    readjust his mind so suddenly to the new idea, and he remained looking at her
                    with many confused memories rushing through his brain. A dozen questions were on
                    his tongue. He remembered afterwards how he had noticed a servant trimming the
                    candle in one of the orange-colored lanterns, and that he had watched him as he
                    disappeared among the palms.</p>
                <p>The silence lasted for so long a time that it had taken on a significance in
                    itself which Carlton recognized. He pulled himself up with a short laugh.
                    "Well," he remonstrated, <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0187" n="152"/> mirthlessly,
                    "I don't think you've treated <hi rend="italic">me</hi> very well."</p>
                <p>"How, not treated you very well?" Miss Morris asked, settling herself more
                    easily. She had been sitting during the pause which followed Carlton's discovery
                    with a certain rigidity, as if she was on a strain of attention. But her tone
                    was now as friendly as always, and held its customary suggestion of amusement.
                    Carlton took his tone from it, although his mind was still busily occupied with
                    incidents and words of hers that she had spoken in their past intercourse.</p>
                <p>"Not fair in letting me think you were engaged," he said. "I've wasted so much
                    time: I'm not half civil enough to engaged girls," he explained.</p>
                <p>"You've been quite civil enough to us," said Miss Morris, "as a courier,
                    philosopher, and friend. I'm very sorry we have to part company."</p>
                <p>"Part company!" exclaimed Carlton, in <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0188" n="153"/>
                    sudden alarm. "But, I say, we mustn't do that."</p>
                <p>"But we must, you see," said Miss Morris. "We must go back for the wedding, and
                    you will have to follow the Princess Aline."</p>
                <p>"Yes, of course," Carlton heard his own voice say. "I had forgotten the Princess
                    Aline." But he was not thinking of what he was saying, nor of the Princess
                    Aline. He was thinking of the many hours Miss Morris and he had been together,
                    of the way she had looked at certain times, and of how he had caught himself
                    watching her at others; how he had pictured the absent Mr. Abbey travelling with
                    her later over the same route, and without a chaperon, sitting close at her side
                    or holding her hand, and telling her just how pretty she was whenever he wished
                    to do so, and without any fear of the consequences. He remembered how ready she
                    had been to understand what he was going <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0189"
                        n="154"/> to say before he had finished saying it, and how she had always
                    made him show the best of himself, and had caused, him to leave unsaid many
                    things that became common and unworthy when considered in the light of her
                    judgment. He recalled how impatient he had been when she was late at dinner, and
                    how cross he was throughout one whole day when she had kept her room. He felt
                    with a sudden shock of delightful fear that he had grown to depend upon her,
                    that she was the best companion he had ever known; and he remembered moments
                    when they had been alone together at the table, or in some old palace, or during
                    a long walk, when they had seemed to have the whole world entirely to
                    themselves, and how he had consoled himself at such times with the thought that
                    no matter how long she might be Abbey's wife, there had been these moments in
                    her life which were his, with which Abbey had had nothing to do.</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0190" n="155"/>
                <p>Carlton turned and looked at her with strange wide-open eyes, as though he saw
                    her for the first time. He felt so sure of himself and of his love for her that
                    the happiness of it made him tremble, and the thought that if he spoke she might
                    answer him in the old, friendly, mocking tone of good-fellowship filled him with
                    alarm. At that moment it seemed to Carlton that the most natural thing in the
                    world for them to do would be to go back again together over the road they had
                    come, seeing everything in the new light of his love for her, and so travel on
                    and on for ever over the world, learning to love each other more and more each
                    succeeding day, and leaving the rest of the universe to move along without them.</p>
                <p>He leaned forward with his arm along the back of the bench, and bent his face
                    towards hers. Her hand lay at her side, and his own closed over it, but the
                    shock that the touch of her fingers gave him <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0191"
                        n="156"/> stopped and confused the words upon his tongue. He looked
                    strangely at her, and could not find the speech he needed.</p>
                <p>Miss Morris gave his hand a firm, friendly little pressure and drew her own away,
                    as if he had taken hers only in an exuberance of good feeling.</p>
                <p>"You have been very nice to us," she said, with an effort to make her tone sound
                    kindly and approving. "And we &mdash; "</p>
                <p>"You mustn't go; I can't let you go," said Carlton, hoarsely. There was no
                    mistaking his tone or his earnestness now. <hi rend="italic">"If</hi> you go,"
                    he went on, breathlessly, "I must go with you."</p>
                <p>The girl moved restlessly; she leaned forward, and drew in her breath with a
                    slight, nervous tremor. Then she turned and faced him, almost as though she were
                    afraid of him or of herself, and they sat so for an instant in silence. The air
                    seemed to have grown close and heavy, and Carlton saw her <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0192" n="157"/> dimly. In the silence he heard the
                    splash of the fountain behind them, and the rustling of the leaves in the night
                    wind, and the low, sighing murmur of a waltz.</p>
                <p>He raised his head to listen, and she saw in the moonlight that he was smiling.
                    It was as though he wished to delay any answer she might make to his last words.</p>
                <p>That is the waltz," he said, still speaking in a whisper, "that the gypsies
                    played that night &mdash; " He stopped, and Miss Morris answered him by
                    bending her head slowly in assent. It seemed to be an effort for her to even
                    make that slight gesture.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">"You</hi> don't remember it," said Carlton. "It meant nothing
                    to you. I mean that night on the steamer when I told you what love meant to
                    other people. What a fool I was!" he said, with an uncertain laugh.</p>
                <p>"Yes, I remember it," she said &mdash; "last Thursday night, on the steamer."</p>
                <p>"Thursday night!" exclaimed Carlton, <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0193" n="158"/>
                    indignantly. "Wednesday night, Tuesday night, how should I know what night of
                    the week it was? It was the night of my life to me. That night I knew that I
                    loved you as I had never hoped to care for any one in this world. When I told
                    you that I did not know what love meant I felt all the time that I was lying. I
                    knew that I loved you, and that I could never love any one else, and that I had
                    never loved any one before; and if I had thought then you could care for me,
                    your engagement or your promises would never have stopped my telling you so. You
                    said that night that I would learn to love all the better, and more truly, for
                    having doubted myself so long, and, oh, Edith," he cried, taking both her hands
                    and holding them close in his own, "I cannot let you go now! I love you so!
                    Don't laugh at me; don't mock at me. All the rest of my life depends on you."</p>
                <p>And then Miss Morris laughed softly, just <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0194"
                        n="159"/> as he had begged her not to do, but her laughter was so full of
                    happiness, and came so gently and sweetly, and spoke so truly of content, that
                    though he let go of her hands with one of his, it was only that he might draw
                    her to him, until her face touched his, and she felt the strength of his arm as
                    he held her against his breast.</p>
                <p>The Hohenwalds occupied the suite of rooms on the first floor of the hotel, with
                    the privilege of using the broad balcony that reached out from it over the front
                    entrance. And at the time when Mrs. Downs and Edith Morris and Carlton drove up
                    to the hotel from the ball, the Princess Aline was leaning over the balcony and
                    watching the lights go out in the upper part of the house, and the moonlight as
                    it fell on the trees and statues in the public park below. Her foot was still in
                    bandages, and she was wrapped in a long cloak to keep her from <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002129_0195" n="160"/> the cold. Inside of the open windows
                    that led out on to the balcony her sisters were taking off their ornaments, and
                    discussing the incidents of the night just over.</p>
                <p>The Princess Aline, unnoticed by those below, saw Carlton help Mrs. Downs to
                    alight from the carriage, and then give his hand to another muffled figure that
                    followed her; and while Mrs. Downs was ascending the steps, and before the
                    second muffled figure had left the shadow of the carriage and stepped into the
                    moonlight, the Princess Aline saw Carlton draw her suddenly back and kiss her
                    lightly on the check, and heard a protesting gasp, and saw Miss Morris pull her
                    cloak over her head and run up the steps. Then she saw Carlton shake hands with
                    them, and stand for a moment after they had disappeared, gazing up at the moon
                    and fumbling in the pockets of his coat. He drew out a cigar-case and leisurely
                    selected a cigar, and with much apparent <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0196"
                        />
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0197"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0198" n="161"/> content lighted it, and then, with
                    his head, thrown back and his chest expanded, as though he were challenging the
                    world, he strolled across the street and disappeared among the shadows of the
                    deserted park.</p>
                <p>The Princess walked back to one of the open windows, and stood there leaning
                    against the side. "That young Mr. Carlton, the artist," she said to her sisters,
                    "is engaged to that beautiful American girl we met the other day."</p>
                <p>"Really!" said the elder sister. "I thought it was probable. Who told you?"</p>
                <p>"I saw him kiss her good-night," said the Princess, stepping into the window, "as
                    they got out of their carriage just now."</p>
                <p>The Princess Aline stood for a moment looking thoughtfully at the floor, and then
                    walked across the room to a little writing-desk. She unlocked a drawer in this
                    and took from it two slips of paper, which she folded in her hand. Then she
                    returned <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0199" n="162"/> slowly across the room, and
                    stepped out again on to the balcony.</p>
                <p>One of the pieces of paper held the picture Carlton had drawn of her, and under
                    which he had written: "This is she. Do you wonder I travelled four thousand
                    miles to see her?" And the other was the picture of Carlton himself, which she
                    had cut out of the catalogue of the Salon.</p>
                <p>From the edge of the balcony where the Princess stood she could see the glimmer
                    of Carlton's white linen and the red glow of his cigar as he strode proudly up
                    and down the path of the public park, like a sentry keeping watch. She folded
                    the pieces of paper together and tore them slowly into tiny fragments, and let
                    them fall through her fingers into the street below. Then she returned again to
                    the room, and stood looking at her sisters.</p>
                <p>"Do you know," she said, "I think I am a little tired of travelling so much. I
                    want <pb entity="DSSR_000002129_0200" n="163"/> to go back to Grasse." She put
                    her hand to her, forehead and held it there for a moment. "I think I am a little
                    homesick," said the Princess Aline.</p>

                    produces one historical novel of such quality. The characters are instinct with

                    writers excel Conan Doyle in this class of literature. His style, vigorous,
                    terse, and thoughtful, united to a nice knowledge of the human mind, makes every
                    character a profoundly interesting psychological study. The reader who enters
                    upon one of his studies is loath to drop the book until it is concluded.

                    were not for its predecessor, we should assign to "Trilby" a place in fiction
                    absolutely companionless. . . . It is one of the most unconventional and

                <p> We have long admired Miss Wilkins as one of the most powerful, original, and
                    profound writers of America; but we are bound to say that "Pembroke" is entitled
                    to a higher distinction than the critics have awarded to Miss Wilkins's earlier
                    productions. As a picture of New England life and character, as a story of such
                    surpassing interest that he who begins is compelled to finish it, as a work of
                    art without a fault or a deficiency, we cannot see how it could possibly be
                    improved. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">N. Y. Sun</hi>. The simplicity, purity,
                    and quaintness of these stories set them apart in a niche of distinction where
                    they have no rivals. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Literary World</hi>, Boston.
                    Nowhere are there to be found such faithful, delicately drawn, sympathetic,
                    tenderly humorous pictures. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">N. Y. Tribute</hi>.
                    The charm of Miss Wilkins's stories is in her intimate acquaintance and
                    comprehension of humble life, and the sweet human interest she feels and makes
                    her readers partake of, in the simple, common, homely people she draws.
