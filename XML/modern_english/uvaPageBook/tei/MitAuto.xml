        <head>INTRODUCTION</head>

        <p> BOTH of the tales in this little volume appeared originally in the "Atlantic
          Monthly'' as anonymous contributions. I owe to the present owners of that
          journal permission to use them. "The Autobiography of a Quack '' has been recast
          with large additions.</p>
        <p> "The Case of George Dedlow'' was not written with any intention that it should
          appear in print. I lent the manuscript to the Rev. Dr. Furness and forgot it.
          This gentleman sent it to the Rev. Edward Everett Hale. He, presuming, I fancy,
          that every one desired to appear in the "Atlantic,'' offered it to that journal.
          To my surprise, soon afterwards I received a proof and a check. The story was
          inserted as a leading article without my name. It was at once accepted by many
          as the description of a real case. Money was <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0023"
            n="x"/> collected in several places to assist the unfortunate man, and
          benevolent persons went to the "Stump Hospital,'' in Philadelphia, to see the
          sufferer and to offer him aid. The spiritual incident at the end of the story
          was received with joy by the spiritualists as a valuable proof of the truth of
          their beliefs.</p>

        <head>THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A QUACK</head>


        <p>AT this present moment of time I am what the doctors call an interesting case,
          and am to be found in bed No. 10, Ward 11, Massachusetts General Hospital. I am
          told that I have what is called Addison's disease, and that it is this pleasing
          malady which causes me to be covered with large blotches of a dark mulatto tint.
          However, it is a rather grim subject to joke about, because, if I believed the
          doctor who comes around every day, and thumps me, and listens to my chest with
          as much pleasure as if I were music all through&mdash;I say, if I really
          believed him, I should suppose I was going to die. The fact is, I don't believe
          him at all. Some of these days I shall take a turn and get about again; but
          meanwhile it is rather <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0027" n="2"/> dull for a
          stirring, active person like me to have to lie still and watch myself getting
          big brown and yellow spots all over me, like a map that has taken to growing. </p>
        <p>The man on my right has consumption &mdash;smells of cod-liver oil, and
          coughs all night. The man on my left is a down-easter with a liver which has
          struck work; looks like a human pumpkin; and how he contrives to whittle
          jackstraws all day, and eat as he does, I can't understand. I have tried reading
          and tried whittling, but they don't either of them satisfy me, so that yesterday
          I concluded to ask the doctor if he could+n't suggest some other amusement. </p>
        <p>I waited until he had gone through the ward, and then seized my chance, and
          asked him to stop a moment. </p>
        <p>"Well, my man,'' said he, "what do you want!'' </p>
        <p>I thought him rather disrespectful, but I replied, "Something to do, doctor.'' </p>
        <p>He thought a little, and then said: "I+'ll tell you what to do. I think if you
          were to write out a plain account of your life it would be pretty well worth
          reading. If half of what you told me last week be true, you must be about as
          clever a scamp as there is <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0028" n="3"/> to be met
          with. I suppose you would just as lief put it on paper as talk it.'' </p>
        <p>"Pretty nearly,'' said I. "I think I will try it, doctor.'' </p>
        <p>After he left I lay awhile thinking over the matter. I knew well that I was
          what the world calls a scamp, and I knew also that I had got little good out of
          the fact. If a man is what people call virtuous, and fails in life, he gets
          credit at least for the virtue; but when a man is a&mdash;is&mdash;well,
          one of liberal views, and breaks down, somehow or other people don't credit him
          with even the intelligence he has put into the business. This I call hard. If I
          did not recall with satisfaction the energy and skill with which I did my work,
          I should be nothing but disgusted at the melancholy spectacle of my failure. I
          suppose that I shall at least find occupation in reviewing all this, and I
          think, therefore, for my own satisfaction, I shall try to amuse my convalescence
          by writing a plain, straightforward account of the life I have led, and the
          various devices by which I have sought to get my share of the money of my
          countrymen. It does appear to me that I have had no end of bad luck. </p>
        <p>As no one will ever see these pages, I find it <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0029"
            n="4"/> pleasant to recall for my own satisfaction the fact that I am really a
          very remarkable man. I am, or rather I was, very good-looking, five feet eleven,
          with a lot of curly red hair, and blue eyes. I am left-handed, which is another
          unusual thing. My hands have often been noticed. I get them from my mother, who
          was a Fishbourne, and a lady. As for my father, he was rather common. He was a
          little man, red and round like an apple, but very strong, for a reason I shall
          come to presently. The family must have had a pious liking for Bible names,
          because he was called Zebulon, my sister Peninnah, and I Ezra, which is not a
          name for a gentleman. At one time I thought of changing it, but I got over it by
          signing myself "E. Sanderaft.'' </p>
        <p>Where my father was born I do not know, except that it was somewhere in New
          Jersey, for I remember that he was once angry because a man called him a Jersey
          Spaniard. I am not much concerned to write about my people, because I soon got
          above their level; and as to my mother, she died when I was an infant. I get my
          manners, which are rather remarkable, from her. </p>
        <p>My aunt, Rachel Sanderaft, who kept house for us, was a queer character. She
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0030" n="5"/> had a snug little property, about
          seven thousand dollars. An old aunt left her the money because she was
          stone-deaf. As this defect came upon her after she grew up, she still kept her
          voice. This woman was the cause of some of my ill luck in life, and I hope she
          is uncomfortable, wherever she is. I think with satisfaction that I helped to
          make her life uneasy when I was young, and worse later on. She gave away to the
          idle poor some of her small income, and hid the rest, like a magpie, in her
          Bible or rolled in her stockings, or in even queerer places. The worst of her
          was that she could tell what people said by looking at their lips; this I hated.
          But as I grew and became intelligent, her ways of hiding her money proved
          useful, to me at least. As to Peninnah, she was nothing special until she
          suddenly bloomed out into a rather stout, pretty girl, took to ribbons, and
          liked what she called "keeping company.'' She ran errands for every one, waited
          on my aunt, and thought I was a wonderful person&mdash;as indeed I was. I
          never could understand her fondness for helping everybody. A fellow has got
          himself to think about, and that is quite enough. I was told pretty often that I
          was the most <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0031" n="6"/> selfish boy alive. But,
          then, I am an unusual person, and there are several names for things. </p>
        <p>My father kept a small shop for the sale of legal stationery and the like, on
          Fifth street north of Chestnut. But his chief interest in life lay in the
          bell-ringing of Christ Church. He was leader, or No. 1, and the whole business
          was in the hands of a kind of guild which is nearly as old as the church. I used
          to hear more of it than I liked, because my father talked of nothing else. But I
          do not mean to bore myself writing of bells. I heard too much about "back
          shake,'' "raising in peal,'' "scales,'' and "touches,'' and the Lord knows what. </p>
        <p>My earliest remembrance is of sitting on my father's shoulder when he led off
          the ringers. He was very strong, as I said, by reason of this exercise. With one
          foot caught in a loop of leather nailed to the floor, he would begin to pull No.
          1, and by and by the whole peal would be swinging, and he going up and down, to
          my joy; I used to feel as if it was I that was making the great noise that rang
          out all over the town. My familiar acquaintance with the old church and its
          lumber-rooms, where were stored the <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0032" n="7"/>
          dusty arms of William and Mary and George II., proved of use in my later days. </p>
        <p>My father had a strong belief in my talents, and I do not think he was
          mistaken. As he was quite uneducated, he determined that I should not be. He had
          saved enough to send me to Princeton College, and when I was about fifteen I was
          set free from the public schools. I never liked them. The last I was at was the
          high school. As I had to come down-town to get home, we used to meet on Arch
          street the boys from the grammar-school of the university, and there were fights
          every week. In winter these were most frequent, because of the snowballing. A
          fellow had to take his share or be marked as a deserter. I never saw any
          personal good to be had out of a fight, but it was better to fight than to be
          cobbed. That means that two fellows hold you, and the other fellows kick you
          with their bent knees. It hurts. </p>
        <p>I find just here that I am describing a thing as if I were writing for some
          other people to see. I may as well go on that way. After all, a man never can
          quite stand off and look at himself as if he was the only person concerned. He
          must have an audience, <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0033" n="8"/> or make believe
          to have one, even if it is only himself. Nor, on the whole, should I be
          unwilling, if it were safe, to let people see how great ability may be defeated
          by the crankiness of fortune. </p>
        <p>I may add here that a stone inside of a snowball discourages the fellow it
          hits. But neither our fellows nor the grammar-school used stones in snowballs. I
          rather liked it. If we had a row in the springtime we all threw stones, and here
          was one of those bits of stupid custom no man can understand; because really a
          stone outside of a snowball is much more serious than if it is mercifully padded
          with snow. I felt it to be a rise in life when I got out of the society of the
          common boys who attended the high school. </p>
        <p>When I was there a man by the name of Dallas Bache was the head master. He had
          a way of letting the boys attend to what he called the character of the school.
          Once I had to lie to him about taking another boy's ball. He told my class that
          I had denied the charge, and that he always took it for granted that a boy spoke
          the truth. He knew well enough what would happen. It did. After that I was
          careful. </p>
        <p>Princeton was then a little college, not <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0034" n="9"
          /> expensive, which was very well, as my father had some difficulty to provide
          even the moderate amount needed. </p>
        <p>I soon found that if I was to associate with the upper set of young men I
          needed money. For some time I waited in vain. But in my second year I discovered
          a small gold-mine, on which I drew with a moderation which shows even thus early
          the strength of my character. </p>
        <p>I used to go home once a month for a Sunday visit, and on these occasions I was
          often able to remove from my aunt's big Bible a five-or ten-dollar note, which
          otherwise would have been long useless. </p>
        <p>Now and then I utilized my opportunities at Princeton. I very much desired
          certain things like well-made clothes, and for these I had to run in debt to a
          tailor. When he wanted pay, and threatened to send the bill to my father, I
          borrowed from two or three young Southerners; but at last, when they became hard
          up, my aunt's uncounted hoard proved a last resource, or some rare chance in a
          neighboring room helped me out. I never did look on this method as of permanent
          usefulness, and it was only the temporary folly of youth. </p>
        <p>Whatever else the pirate necessity <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0035" n="10"/>
          appropriated, I took no large amount of education, although I was fond of
          reading, and especially of novels, which are, I think, very instructive to the
          young, especially the novels of Smollett and Fielding. </p>
        <p>There is, however, little need to dwell on this part of my life. College
          students in those days were only boys, and boys are very strange animals. They
          have instincts. They somehow get to know if a fellow does not relate facts as
          they took place. I like to put it that way, because, after all, the mode of
          putting things is only one of the forms of self-defense, and is less silly than
          the ordinary wriggling methods which boys employ, and which are generally
          useless. I was rather given to telling large stories just for the fun of it and,
          I think, told them well. But somehow I got the reputation of not being strictly
          definite, and when it was meant to indicate this belief they had an ill-mannered
          way of informing you. This consisted in two or three fellows standing up and
          shuffling noisily with their feet on the floor. When first I heard this I asked
          innocently what it meant, and was told it was the noise of the bearers' feet
          coming to take away Ananias. This was considered a fine joke. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0036" n="11"/>
        </p>
        <p>During my junior year I became unpopular, and as I was very cautious, I cannot
          see why. At last, being hard up, I got to be foolishly reckless. But why dwell
          on the failures of immaturity? </p>
        <p>The causes which led to my leaving Nassau Hall were not, after all, the
          mischievous outbreaks in which college lads indulge. Indeed, I have never been
          guilty of any of those pieces of wanton wickedness which injure the feelings of
          others while they lead to no useful result. When I left to return home, I set
          myself seriously to reflect upon the necessity of greater care in following out
          my inclinations, and from that time forward I have steadily avoided, whenever it
          was possible, the vulgar vice of directly possessing myself of objects to which
          I could show no legal title. My father was indignant at the results of my
          college career; and, according to my aunt, his shame and sorrow had some effect
          in shortening his life. My sister believed my account of the matter. It ended in
          my being used for a year as an assistant in the shop, and in being taught to
          ring bells &mdash;a fine exercise, but not proper work for a man of
          refinement. My father died while training his bell-ringers in the Oxford triple
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0037" n="12"/> bob&mdash;broke a blood-vessel
          somewhere. How I could have caused that I do not see. </p>
        <p>I was now about nineteen years old, and, as I remember, a middle-sized,
          well-built young fellow, with large eyes, a slight mustache, and, I have been
          told, with very good manners and a somewhat humorous turn. Besides these
          advantages, my guardian held in trust for me about two thousand dollars. After
          some consultation between us, it was resolved that I should study medicine. This
          conclusion was reached nine years before the Rebellion broke out, and after we
          had settled, for the sake of economy, in Woodbury, New Jersey. From this time I
          saw very little of my deaf aunt or of Peninnah. I was resolute to rise in the
          world, and not to be weighted by relatives who were without my tastes and my
          manners. </p>
        <p>I set out for Philadelphia, with many good counsels from my aunt and guardian.
          I look back upon this period as a turning-point of my life. I had seen enough of
          the world already to know that if you can succeed without exciting suspicion, it
          is by far the pleasantest way; and I really believe that if I had not been
          endowed with so fatal a liking for all the good things of life I might <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0038" n="13"/> have lived along as reputably as most
          men. This, however, is, and always has been, my difficulty, and I suppose that I
          am not responsible for the incidents to which it gave rise. Most men have some
          ties in life, but I have said I had none which held me. Peninnah cried a good
          deal when we parted, and this, I think, as I was still young, had a very good
          effect in strengthening my resolution to do nothing which could get me into
          trouble. The janitor of the college to which I went directed me to a
          boarding-house, where I engaged a small third-story room, which I afterwards
          shared with Mr. Chaucer of Georgia. He pronounced it, as I remember, "Jawjah.'' </p>
        <p>In this very remarkable abode I spent the next two winters, and finally
          graduated, along with two hundred more, at the close of my two years of study. I
          should previously have been one year in a physician's office as a student, but
          this regulation was very easily evaded. As to my studies, the less said the
          better. I attended the quizzes, as they call them, pretty closely, and, being of
          a quick and retentive memory, was thus enabled to dispense with some of the six
          or seven lectures a day which duller men found it necessary to follow. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0039" n="14"/>
        </p>
        <p>Dissecting struck me as a rather nasty business for a gentleman, and on this
          account I did just as little as was absolutely essential. In fact, if a man took
          his tickets and paid the dissection fees, nobody troubled himself as to whether
          or not he did any more than this. A like evil existed at the graduation: whether
          you squeezed through or passed with credit was a thing which was not made
          public, so that I had absolutely nothing to stimulate my ambition. I am told
          that it is all very different to-day. </p>
        <p>The astonishment with which I learned of my success was shared by the numerous
          Southern gentlemen who darkened the floors and perfumed with tobacco the rooms
          of our boarding-house. In my companions, during the time of my studies so
          called, as in other matters of life, I was somewhat unfortunate. All of them
          were Southern gentlemen, with more money than I had. Many of them carried great
          sticks, usually sword-canes, and some bowie-knives or pistols; also, they
          delighted in swallow-tailed coats, long hair, broad-brimmed felt hats, and very
          tight boots. I often think of these gentlemen with affectionate interest, and
          wonder how many are lying under the wheat-fields of <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0040" n="15"/> Virginia. One could see them any day
          sauntering along with their arms over their companions' shoulders, splendidly
          indifferent to the ways of the people about them. They hated the "Nawth'' and
          cursed the Yankees, and honestly believed that the leanest of them was a match
          for any half a dozen of the bulkiest of Northerners. I must also do them the
          justice to say that they were quite as ready to fight as to brag, which, by the
          way, is no meager statement. With these gentry&mdash;for whom I retain a
          respect which filled me with regret at the recent course of events&mdash;I
          spent a good deal of my large leisure. The more studious of both sections called
          us a hard crowd. What we did, or how we did it, little concerns me here, except
          that, owing to my esteem for chivalric blood and breeding, I was led into many
          practices and excesses which cost my guardian and myself a good deal of money.
          At the close of my career as a student I found myself aged twenty-one years, and
          the owner of some seven hundred dollars&mdash;the rest of my small estate
          having disappeared variously within the last two years. After my friends had
          gone to their homes in the South I began to look about me for an office, and
          finally settled <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0041" n="16"/> upon very good rooms
          in one of the downtown localities of the Quaker City. I am not specific as to
          the number and street, for reasons which may hereafter appear. I liked the
          situation on various accounts. It had been occupied by a doctor; the terms were
          reasonable; and it lay on the skirts of a good neighborhood, while below it
          lived a motley population, among which I expected to get my first patients and
          such fees as were to be had. Into this new home I moved my medical text-books, a
          few bones, and myself. Also, I displayed in the window a fresh sign, upon which
          was distinctly to be read: DR. E. SANDCRAFT. Office hours, 8 to 9 A.M., 7 to 9
          P.M. </p>
        <p>I felt now that I had done my fair share toward attaining a virtuous
          subsistence, and so I waited tranquilly, and without undue enthusiasm, to see
          the rest of the world do its part in the matter. Meanwhile I read up on all
          sorts of imaginable cases, stayed at home all through my office hours, and at
          intervals explored the strange section of the town which lay to the south of my
          office. I do not suppose there is anything like it else <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0042" n="17"/> where. It was then filled with
          grog-shops, brothels, slop-shops, and low lodging-houses. You could dine for a
          penny on soup made from the refuse meats of the rich, gathered at back gates by
          a horde of half-naked children, who all told varieties of one woeful tale. Here,
          too, you could be drunk for five cents, and be lodged for three, with men,
          women, and children of all colors lying about you. It was this hideous mixture
          of black and white and yellow wretchedness which made the place so peculiar. The
          blacks predominated, and had mostly that swollen, reddish, dark skin, the sign
          in this race of habitual drunkenness. Of course only the lowest whites were
          here&mdash;rag-pickers, pawnbrokers, old-clothes men, thieves, and the like.
          All of this, as it came before me, I viewed with mingled disgust and philosophy.
          I hated filth, but I understood that society has to stand on somebody, and I was
          only glad that I was not one of the undermost and worst-squeezed bricks. </p>
        <p>I can hardly believe that I waited a month without having been called upon by a
          single patient. At last a policeman on our beat brought me a fancy man with a
          dog-bite. This patient recommended me to his brother, <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0043" n="18"/> the keeper of a small pawnbroking-shop,
          and by very slow degrees I began to get stray patients who were too poor to
          indulge in uptown doctors. I found the police very useful acquaintances; and, by
          a drink or a cigar now and then, I got most of the cases of cut heads and the
          like at the next station-house. These, however, were the aristocrats of my
          practice; the bulk of my patients were soap-fat men, rag-pickers, oystermen,
          hose-house bummers, and worse, with other and nameless trades, men and women,
          white, black, or mulatto. How they got the levies, fips, and quarters with which
          I was reluctantly paid, I do not know; that, indeed, was none of my business.
          They expected to pay, and they came to me in preference to the dispensary
          doctor, two or three squares away, who seemed to me to spend most of his days in
          the lanes and alleys about us. Of course he received no pay except experience,
          since the dispensaries in the Quaker City, as a rule, do not give salaries to
          their doctors; and the vilest of the poor prefer a "pay doctor'' to one of these
          disinterested gentlemen, who cannot be expected to give their best brains for
          nothing, when at everybody's beck and call. I am told, indeed I know, <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0044" n="19"/> that most young doctors do a large
          amount of poor practice, as it is called; but, for my own part, I think it
          better for both parties when the doctor insists upon some compensation being
          made to him. This has been usually my own custom, and I have not found reason to
          regret it. </p>
        <p>Notwithstanding my strict attention to my own interests, I have been rather
          sorely dealt with by fate upon several occasions, where, so far as I could see,
          I was vigilantly doing everything in my power to keep myself out of trouble or
          danger. I may as well relate one of them, merely to illustrate of how little
          value a man's intellect may be when fate and the prejudices of the mass of men
          are against him. </p>
        <p>One evening, late, I myself answered a ring at the bell, and found a small
          black boy on the steps, a shoeless, hatless little wretch, curled darkness for
          hair, and teeth like new tombstones. It was pretty cold, and he was relieving
          his feet by standing first on one and then on the other. He did not wait for me
          to speak. </p>
        <p>"Hi, sah, Missey Barker she say to come quick away, sah, to Numbah 709 Bedford
          street.'' <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0045" n="20"/>
        </p>
        <p>The locality did not look like pay, but it is hard to say in this quarter,
          because sometimes you found a well-to-do "brandy-snifter'' (local for gin-shop)
          or a hard-working "leather-jeweler'' (ditto for shoemaker), with next door, in a
          house better or worse, dozens of human rats for whom every police trap in the
          city was constantly set. </p>
        <p>With a doubt in my mind as to whether I should find a good patient or some
          dirty nigger, I sought the place to which I had been directed. I did not like
          its looks; but I blundered up an alley and into a back room, where I fell over
          somebody, and was cursed and told to lie down and keep easy, or somebody,
          meaning the man stumbled over, would make me. At last I lit on a staircase which
          led into the alley, and, after much useless inquiry, got as high as the garret.
          People hereabout did not know one another, or did not want to know, so that it
          was of little avail to ask questions. At length I saw a light through the cracks
          in the attic door, and walked in. To my amazement, the first person I saw was a
          woman of about thirty-five, in pearl-gray Quaker dress&mdash;one of your
          quiet, good-looking people. She was seated on a stool beside a straw mattress
          upon <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0046" n="21"/> which lay a black woman. There
          were three others crowded close around a small stove, which was
          red-hot&mdash;an unusual spectacle in this street. Altogether a most nasty
          den. </p>
        <p>As I came in, the little Quaker woman got up and said: "I took the liberty of
          sending for thee to look at this poor woman I am afraid she has the smallpox.
          Will thee be so kind as to look at her?'' And with this she held down the candle
          toward the bed. </p>
        <p>"Good gracious!'' I said hastily, seeing how the creature was speckled "I
          did+n't understand this, or I would not have come. I have important cases which
          I cannot subject to the risk of contagion. Best let her alone, miss,'' I added,
          "or send her to the smallpox hospital.'' </p>
        <p>Upon my word, I was astonished at the little woman's indignation. She said just
          those things which make you feel as if somebody had been calling you names or
          kicking you&mdash;Was I really a doctor? and so on. It did not gain by being
          put in the ungrammatical tongue of Quakers. However, I never did fancy smallpox,
          and what could a fellow get by doctoring wretches like these? So I held my
          tongue and went away. About a week afterwards I met Evans, the dispensary <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0047" n="22"/> man, a very common fellow, who was said
          to be frank. </p>
        <p>"Helloa!'' says he. "Doctor, you made a nice mistake about that darky at No.
          709 Bedford street the other night. She had nothing but measles, after all.'' </p>
        <p>"Of course I knew,'' said I, laughing; "but you don't think I was going in for
          dispensary trash, do you?'' </p>
        <p>"I should think not,'' said Evans. </p>
        <p>I learned afterwards that this Miss Barker had taken an absurd fancy to the man
          because he had doctored the darky and would not let the Quakeress pay him. The
          end was, when I wanted to get a vacancy in the Southwark Dispensary, where they
          do pay the doctors, Miss Barker was malignant enough to take advantage of my
          oversight by telling the whole story to the board; so that Evans got in, and I
          was beaten. </p>
        <p>You may be pretty sure that I found rather slow the kind of practice I have
          described, and began to look about for chances of bettering myself. In this sort
          of locality rather risky cases turned up now and then; and as soon as I got to
          be known as a reliable man, I began to get the peculiar sort of practice I
          wanted. Notwithstanding all my efforts, I <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0048"/>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0049"/>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0050" n="25"/> found myself, at the close of three
          years, with all my means spent, and just able to live meagerly from hand to
          mouth, which by no means suited a man of my refined tastes. </p>
        <p>Once or twice I paid a visit to my aunt, and was able to secure moderate aid by
          overhauling her concealed hoardings. But as to these changes of property I was
          careful, and did not venture to secure the large amount I needed. As to the
          Bible, it was at this time hidden, and I judged it, therefore, to be her chief
          place of deposit. Banks she utterly distrusted. </p>
        <p>Six months went by, and I was worse off than ever&mdash;two months in
          arrears of rent, and numerous other debts to cigar-shops and liquor-dealers. Now
          and then some good job, such as a burglar with a cut head, helped me for a
          while; but, on the whole, I was like Slider Downeyhylle in Neal's "Charcoal
          Sketches,'' and kept going "downer and downer'' the more I tried not to.
          Something had to be done. </p>
        <p>It occurred to me, about this time, that if I moved into a more genteel
          locality I might get a better class of patients, and yet keep the best of those
          I now had. To do this it was necessary to pay my rent, and the more <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0051" n="26"/> so because I was in a fair way to have
          no house at all over my head. But here fortune interposed. I was caught in a
          heavy rainstorm on Seventh Street, and ran to catch an omnibus. As I pulled open
          the door I saw behind me the Quaker woman, Miss Barker. I laughed and jumped in.
          She had to run a little before the 'bus again stopped. She got pretty wet. An
          old man in the corner, who seemed in the way of taking charge of other people's
          manners, said to me: "Young man, you ought to be ashamed to get in before the
          lady, and in this pour, too!'' </p>
        <p>I said calmly, "But you got in before her.'' </p>
        <p>He made no reply to this obvious fact, as he might have been in the bus a
          half-hour. A large, well-dressed man near by said, with a laugh, "Rather neat,
          that,'' and, turning, tried to pull up a window-sash. In the effort something
          happened, and he broke the glass, cutting his hand in half a dozen places. While
          he was using several quite profane phrases, I caught his hand and said, "I am a
          surgeon,'' and tied my handkerchief around the bleeding palm. </p>
        <p>The guardian of manners said, "I hope you are not much hurt, but there was no
          reason why you should swear.'' <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0052" n="27"/>
        </p>
        <p>On this my patient said, "Go to &mdash;,'' which silenced the monitor. </p>
        <p>I explained to the wounded man that the cuts should be looked after at once.
          The matter was arranged by our leaving the 'bus, and, as the rain had let up,
          walking to his house. This was a large and quite luxurious dwelling on Fourth
          street. There I cared for his wounds, which, as I had informed him, required
          immediate attention. It was at this time summer, and his wife and niece, the
          only other members of his family, were absent. On my second visit I made believe
          to remove some splinters of glass which I brought with me. He said they showed
          how shamefully thin was that omnibus windowpane. To my surprise, my patient, at
          the end of the month,&mdash;for one wound was long in
          healing,&mdash;presented me with one hundred dollars. This paid my small
          rental, and as Mr. Poynter allowed me to refer to him, I was able to get a
          better office and bedroom on Spruce street. I saw no more of my patient until
          winter, although I learned that he was a stock-broker, not in the very best
          repute, but of a well-known family. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile my move had been of small use. I was wise enough, however, to keep up
          my <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0053" n="28"/> connection with my former clients,
          and contrived to live. It was no more than that. One day in December I was
          overjoyed to see Mr. Poynter enter. He was a fat man, very pale, and never, to
          my remembrance, without a permanent smile. He had very civil ways, and now at
          once I saw that he wanted something. </p>
        <p>I hated the way that man saw through me. He went on without hesitation, taking
          me for granted. He began by saying he had confidence in my judgment, and when a
          man says that you had better look out. He said he had a niece who lived with
          him, a brother's child; that she was out of health and ought not to marry, which
          was what she meant to do. She was scared about her health, because she had a
          cough, and had lost a brother of consumption. I soon came to understand that,
          for reasons unknown to me, my friend did not wish his niece to marry. His wife,
          he also informed me, was troubled as to the niece's health. Now, he said, he
          wished to consult me as to what he should do. I suspected at once that he had
          not told me all. </p>
        <p>I have often wondered at the skill with which I managed this rather delicate
          matter. I knew I was not well enough known to be of direct use, and was also too
          young <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0054" n="29"/> to have much weight. I advised
          him to get Professor C. </p>
        <p>Then my friend shook his head. He said in reply, "But suppose, doctor, he says
          there is nothing wrong with the girl?'' </p>
        <p>Then I began to understand him. </p>
        <p>"Oh,'' I said, "you get a confidential written opinion from him. You can make
          it what you please when you tell her.'' </p>
        <p>He said no. It would be best for me to ask the professor to see Miss Poynter;
          might mention my youth, and so on, as a reason. I was to get his opinion in
          writing. </p>
        <p>"Well?'' said I. </p>
        <p>"After that I want you to write me a joint opinion to meet the
          case&mdash;all the needs of the case, you see.'' </p>
        <p>I saw, but hesitated as to how much would make it worth while to pull his hot
          chestnuts out of the fire&mdash;one never knows how hot the chestnuts are. </p>
        <p>Then he said, "Ever take a chance in stocks?'' </p>
        <p>I said, "No.'' </p>
        <p>He said that he would lend me a little money and see what he could do with it.
          And here was his receipt from me for one thousand dollars, and here, too, was my
          order to <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0055" n="30"/> buy shares of P. T. Y. Would
          I please to Sign it? I did. </p>
        <p>I was to call in two days at his house, and meantime I could think it over. It
          seemed to me a pretty weak plan. Suppose the young woman&mdash;well,
          supposing is awfully destructive of enterprise; and as for me, I had only to
          misunderstand the professor's opinion. I went to the house, and talked to Mr.
          Poynter about his gout. Then Mrs. Poynter came in, and began to lament her
          niece's declining health. After that I saw Miss Poynter. There is a kind of
          innocent-looking woman who knows no more of the world than a young chicken, and
          is choke-full of emotions. I saw it would be easy to frighten her. There are
          some instruments anybody can get any tune they like out of. I was very grave,
          and advised her to see the professor. And would I write to ask him, said Mr.
          Poynter. I said I would. </p>
        <p>As I went out Mr. Poynter remarked: "You will clear some four hundred easy.
          Write to the professor. Bring my receipt to the office next week, and we will
          settle.'' </p>
        <p>We settled. I tore up his receipt and gave him one for fifteen hundred dollars,
          and received in notes five hundred dollars. <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0056"
            n="31"/>
        </p>
        <p>In a day or so I had a note from the professor stating that Miss Poynter was in
          no peril; that she was, as he thought, worried, and had only a mild bronchial
          trouble. He advised me to do so-and-so, and had ventured to reassure my young
          patient. Now, this was a little more than I wanted. However, I wrote Mr. Poynter
          that the professor thought she had bronchitis, that in her case tubercle would
          be very apt to follow, and that at present, and until she was safe, we
          considered marriage undesirable. </p>
        <p>Mr. Poynter said it might have been put stronger, but he would make it do. He
          made it. The first effect was an attack of hysterics. The final result was that
          she eloped with her lover, because if she was to die, as she wrote her aunt, she
          wished to die in her husband's arms. Human nature plus hysteria will defy all
          knowledge of character. This was what our old professor of practice used to say. </p>
        <p>Mr. Poynter had now to account for a large trust estate which had somehow
          dwindled. Unhappily, princes are not the only people in whom you must not put
          your trust. As to myself, Professor L. somehow got to know the facts, and cut me
          dead. It was <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0057" n="32"/> unpleasant, but I had my
          five hundred dollars, and&mdash;I needed them. I do not see how I could have
          been more careful. </p>
        <p>After this things got worse. Mr. Poynter broke, and did not even pay my last
          bill. I had to accept several rather doubtful cases, and once a policeman I knew
          advised me that I had better be on my guard. </p>
        <p>But, really, so long as I adhered to the common code of my profession I was in
          danger of going without my dinner. </p>
        <p>Just as I was at my worst and in despair something always turned up, but it was
          sure to be risky; and now my aunt refused to see me, and Peninnah wrote me
          goody-goody letters, and said Aunt Rachel had been unable to find certain
          bank-notes she had hidden, and vowed I had taken them. This Peninnah did not
          think possible. I agreed with her. The notes were found somewhat later by
          Peninnah in the toes of a pair of my aunt's old slippers. Of course I wrote an
          indignant letter. My aunt declared that Peninnah had stolen the notes, and
          restored them when they were missed. Poor Peninnah! This did not seem to me very
          likely, but Peninnah did love fine clothes. </p>
        <p>One night, as I was debating with myself <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0058"
            n="33"/> as to how I was to improve my position, I heard a knock on my
          shutter, and, going to the door, let in a broad-shouldered man with a whisky
          face and a great hooked nose. He wore a heavy black beard and mustache, and
          looked like the wolf in the pictures of Red Riding-hood which I had seen as a
          child. </p>
        <p>"Your name+'s Sanderaft?'' said the man. </p>
        <p>"Yes; that+'s my name&mdash;Dr. Sanderaft.'' </p>
        <p>As he sat down he shook the snow over everything, and said coolly: "Set down,
          doc; I want to talk with you.'' </p>
        <p>"What can I do for you?'' said I. </p>
        <p>The man looked around the room rather scornfully, at the same time throwing
          back his coat and displaying a red neckerchief and a huge garnet pin. "Guess
          you+'re not overly rich,'' he said. </p>
        <p>"Not especially,'' said I. "What+'s that your business?'' </p>
        <p>He did not answer, but merely said, "Know Simon Stagers?'' </p>
        <p>"Can't say I do,'' said I, cautiously. Simon was a burglar who had blown off
          two fingers when mining a safe. I had attended him while he was hiding. </p>
        <p>"Can't say you do. Well, you can lie, and no mistake. Come, now, doc. Simon
          says <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0059" n="34"/> you're safe, and I want to have a
          leetle plain talk with you.'' </p>
        <p>With this he laid ten gold eagles on the table. I put out my hand
          instinctively. </p>
        <p>"Let 'em alone,'' cried the man, sharply. "They+'re easy earned, and ten more
          like 'em.'' </p>
        <p>"For doing what?'' I said. </p>
        <p>The man paused a moment, and looked around him; next he stared at me, and
          loosened his cravat with a hasty pull. "You+'re the coroner,'' said he. </p>
        <p>"I! What do you mean?'' </p>
        <p>"Yes, you+'re the coroner; don't you understand?'' and so saying, he shoved the
          gold pieces toward me. </p>
        <p>"Very good,'' said I; "we will suppose I m the coroner. What next?'' </p>
        <p>"And being the coroner,'' said he, "you get this note, which requests you to
          call at No. 9 Blank street to examine the body of a young man which is
          supposed&mdash;only supposed, you see&mdash;to have&mdash;well, to
          have died under suspicious circumstances.'' </p>
        <p>"Go on,'' said I. </p>
        <p>"No,'' he returned; "not till I know how you like it. Stagers and another knows
          it; and it would+n't be very safe for you to split, besides not making nothing
          out of it. But <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0060" n="35"/> what I say is this, Do
          you like the business of coroner?'' </p>
        <p>I did not like it; but just then two hundred in gold was life to me, so I said:
          "Let me hear the whole of it first. I am safe.'' </p>
        <p>"That+'s square enough,'' said the man. "My wife+'s got''&mdash;correcting
          himself with a shivery shrug&mdash;"my wife had a brother that took to
          cutting up rough because when I+'d been up too late I handled her a leetle hard
          now and again. </p>
        <p>"Luckily he fell sick with typhoid just then&mdash;you see, he lived with
          us. When he got better I guessed he+'d drop all that; but somehow he was worse
          than ever&mdash;clean off his head, and strong as an ox. My wife said to put
          him away in an asylum. I did+n't think that would do. At last he tried to get
          out. He was going to see the police about&mdash; well&mdash;the thing
          was awful serious, and my wife carrying on like mad, and wanting doctors. I had
          no mind to run, and something had got to be done. So Simon Stagers and I talked
          it over. The end of it was, he took worse of a sudden, and got so he did+n't
          know nothing. Then I rushed for a doctor. He said it was a perforation, and
          there ought to have been a doctor when he was first took sick. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0061" n="36"/>
        </p>
        <p>"Well, the man died, and as I kept about the house, my wife had no chance to
          talk. The doctor fussed a bit, but at last he gave a certificate. I thought we
          were done with it. But my wife she writes a note and gives it to a boy in the
          alley to put in the post. We suspicioned her, and Stagers was on the watch.
          After the boy got away a bit, Simon bribed him with a quarter to give him the
          note, which was+n't no less than a request to the coroner to come to the house
          to-morrow and make an examination, as foul play was suspected&mdash;and
          poison.'' </p>
        <p>When the man quit talking he glared at me. I sat still. I was cold all over. I
          was afraid to go on, and afraid to go back, besides which, I did not doubt that
          there was a good deal of money in the case. </p>
        <p>"Of course,'' said I, "it+'s nonsense; only I suppose you don't want the
          officers about, and a fuss, and that sort of thing.'' </p>
        <p>"Exactly,'' said my friend. "It+'s all bosh about poison. You+'re the coroner.
          You take this note and come to my house. Says you: `Mrs. File, are you the woman
          that wrote this note? Because in that case I must examine the body.' '' </p>
        <p>"I see,'' said I; "she need+n't know who I <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0062"
            n="37"/> am, or anything else; but if I tell her it+'s all right, do you think
          she won't want to know why there is+n't a jury, and so on?'' </p>
        <p>"Bless you,'' said the man, "the girl is+n't over seventeen, and does+n't know
          no more than a baby. As we live up-town miles away, she won't know anything
          about you.'' </p>
        <p>"I+'ll do it,'' said I, suddenly, for, as I saw, it involved no sort of risk;
          "but I must have three hundred dollars.'' </p>
        <p>"And fifty,'' added the wolf, "if you do it well.'' </p>
        <p>Then I knew it was serious. </p>
        <p>With this the man buttoned about him a shaggy gray overcoat, and took his leave
          without a single word in addition. </p>
        <p>A minute later he came back and said: "Stagers is in this business, and I was
          to remind you of Lou Wilson,&mdash;I forgot that,&mdash; the woman that
          died last year. That+'s all.'' Then he went away, leaving me in a cold sweat. I
          knew now I had no choice. I understood why I had been selected. </p>
        <p>For the first time in my life, that night I could+n't sleep. I thought to
          myself, at last, that I would get up early, pack a few clothes, and escape,
          leaving my books to pay as they might my arrears of rent. Looking out of <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0063" n="38"/> the window, however, in the morning, I
          saw Stagers prowling about the opposite pavement; and as the only exit except
          the street door was an alleyway which opened alongside of the front of the
          house, I gave myself up for lost. About ten o'clock I took my case of
          instruments and started for File's house, followed, as I too well understood, by
          Stagers. </p>
        <p>I knew the house, which was in a small uptown street, by its closed windows and
          the craped bell, which I shuddered as I touched. However, it was too late to
          draw back, and I therefore inquired for Mrs. File. A haggard-looking young woman
          came down, and led me into a small parlor, for whose darkened light I was
          thankful enough. </p>
        <p>"Did you write this note?'' </p>
        <p>"I did,'' said the woman, "if you+'re the coroner. Joe File&mdash;he+'s my
          husband&mdash;he+'s gone out to see about the funeral. I wish it was his, I
          do.'' </p>
        <p>"What do you suspect?'' said I. </p>
        <p>"I+'ll tell you,'' she returned in a whisper. "I think he was made away with. I
          think there was foul play. I think he was poisoned. That+'s what I think.'' </p>
        <p>"I hope you may be mistaken,'' said I. "Suppose you let me see the body.'' <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0064"/>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0065"/>> <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0066" n="41"/>
        </p>
        <p>"You shall see it,'' she replied; and following her, I went up-stairs to a
          front chamber, where I found the corpse. </p>
        <p>"Get it over soon,'' said the woman, with strange firmness. "If there ain't no
          murder been done I shall have to run for it; if there was''&mdash;and her
          face set hard&mdash;"I guess I+'ll stay.'' With this she closed the door and
          left me with the dead. </p>
        <p>If I had known what was before me I never could have gone into the thing at
          all. It looked a little better when I had opened a window and let in plenty of
          light; for although I was, on the whole, far less afraid of dead than living
          men, I had an absurd feeling that I was doing this dead man a distinct
          wrong&mdash;as if it mattered to the dead, after all! When the affair was
          over, I thought more of the possible consequences than of its relation to the
          dead man himself; but do as I would at the time, I was in a ridiculous funk, and
          especially when going through the forms of a post-mortem examination. </p>
        <p>I am free to confess now that I was careful not to uncover the man's face, and
          that when it was over I backed to the door and hastily escaped from the room. On
          the stairs <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0067" n="42"/> opposite to me Mrs. File
          was seated, with her bonnet on and a bundle in her hand. </p>
        <p>"Well,'' said she, rising as she spoke, and with a certain eagerness in her
          tone, "what killed him? Was it poison?'' </p>
        <p>"Poison, my good woman!'' said I. "When a man has typhoid fever he don't need
          poison to kill him. He had a relapse, that+'s all.'' </p>
        <p>"And do you mean to say he was+n't poisoned,'' said she, with more than a trace
          of disappointment in her voice&mdash;"not poisoned at all?'' </p>
        <p>"No more than you are,'' said I. "If I had found any signs of foul play I
          should have had a regular inquest. As it is, the less said about it the better.
          The fact is, it would have been much wiser to have kept quiet at the beginning.
          I can't understand why you should have troubled me about it at all. The man had
          a perforation. It is common enough in typhoid.'' </p>
        <p>"That+'s what the doctor said&mdash;I did+n't believe him. I guess now the
          sooner I leave the better for me.'' </p>
        <p>"As to that,'' I returned, "it is none of my business; but you may rest certain
          about the cause of your brother's death.'' </p>
        <p>My fears were somewhat quieted that <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0068" n="43"/>
          evening when Stagers and the wolf appeared with the remainder of the money, and
          I learned that Mrs. File had fled from her home and, as File thought likely,
          from the city also. A few months later File himself disappeared, and Stagers
          found his way for the third time into the penitentiary. Then I felt at ease. I
          now see, for my own part, that I was guilty of more than one mistake, and that I
          displayed throughout a want of intelligence. I ought to have asked more, and
          also might have got a good fee from Mrs. File on account of my services as
          coroner. It served me, however, as a good lesson; but it was several months
          before I felt quite comfortable. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile money became scarce once more, and I was driven to my wit's end to
          devise how I should continue to live as I had done. I tried, among other plans,
          that of keeping certain pills and other medicines, which I sold to my patients;
          but on the whole I found it better to send all my prescriptions to one druggist,
          who charged the patient ten or twenty cents over the correct price, and handed
          this amount to me. </p>
        <p>In some cases I am told the percentage is supposed to be a donation on the part
          of the <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0069" n="44"/> apothecary; but I rather fancy
          the patient pays for it in the end. It is one of the absurd vagaries of the
          profession to discountenance the practice I have described, but I wish, for my
          part, I had never done anything more foolish or more dangerous. Of course it
          inclines a doctor to change his medicines a good deal, and to order them in
          large quantities, which is occasionally annoying to the poor; yet, as I have
          always observed, there is no poverty as painful as your own, so that I prefer to
          distribute pecuniary suffering among many rather than to concentrate it on
          myself. That+'s a rather neat phrase. </p>
        <p>About six months after the date of this annoying adventure, an incident
          occurred which altered somewhat, and for a time improved, my professional
          position. During my morning office-hour an old woman came in, and putting down a
          large basket, wiped her face with a yellow-cotton handkerchief, and afterwards
          with the corner of her apron. Then she looked around uneasily, got up, settled
          her basket on her arm with a jerk which may have decided the future of an egg or
          two, and remarked briskly: "Don't see no little bottles about; got the wrong
          stall, I guess. You ain't no homeopath doctor, are you?'' <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0070" n="45"/>
        </p>
        <p>With great presence of mind, I replied: "Well, ma'am, that depends upon what
          you want. Some of my patients like one, and some like the other.'' I was about
          to add, "You pay your money and you take your choice,'' but thought better of
          it, and held my peace, refraining from classical quotation. </p>
        <p>"Being as that+'s the case,'' said the old lady, "I+'ll just tell you my
          symptoms. You said you give either kind of medicine, did+n't you?'' </p>
        <p>"Just so,'' replied I. </p>
        <p>"Clams or oysters, whichever opens most lively, as my old Joe says &mdash;
          tends the oysterstand at stall No. 9. Happen to know Joe?'' </p>
        <p>No, I did not know Joe; but what were the symptoms? </p>
        <p>They proved to be numerous, and included a stunning in the head and a misery in
          the side, with bokin after victuals. </p>
        <p>I proceeded, of course, to apply a stethoscope over her ample bosom, though
          what I heard on this and similar occasions I should find it rather difficult to
          state. I remember well my astonishment in one instance where, having
          unconsciously applied my instrument over a clamorous silver watch in the watch
          fob of a sea-captain, I concluded for a moment that he was suffering from a
          rather <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0071" n="46"/> remarkable displacement of the
          heart. As to my old lady, whose name was Checkers, and who kept an apple-stand
          near by, I told her that I was out of pills just then, but would have plenty
          next day. Accordingly, I proceeded to invest a small amount at a place called a
          homeopathic pharmacy, which I remember amused me immensely. </p>
        <p>A stout little German, with great silver spectacles, sat behind a counter
          containing numerous jars of white powders labeled concisely "Lac.,'' "Led.,''
          "Onis.,'' "Op.,'' "Puls.,'' etc., while behind him were shelves filled with
          bottles of what looked like minute white shot. </p>
        <p>"I want some homeopathic medicine,'' said I. </p>
        <p>"Vat kindt?'' said my friend. "Vat you vants to cure!'' </p>
        <p>I explained at random that I wished to treat diseases in general. </p>
        <p>"Vell, ve gifs you a case, mit a pook,'' and thereon produced a large box
          containing bottles of small pills and powders, labeled variously with the names
          of the diseases, so that all you required was to use the headache or colic
          bottle in order to meet the needs of those particular maladies. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0072" n="47"/>
        </p>
        <p>I was struck at first with the exquisite simplicity of this arrangement; but
          before purchasing, I happened luckily to turn over the leaves of a book, in two
          volumes, which lay on the counter; it was called "Jahr's Manual.'' Opening at
          page 310, vol. I, I lit upon "Lachesis,'' which proved to my amazement to be
          snake-venom. This Mr. Jahr stated to be indicated for use in upward of a hundred
          symptoms. At once it occurred to me that "Lach.'' was the medicine for my money,
          and that it was quite needless to waste cash on the box. I therefore bought a
          small jar of "Lach.'' and a lot of little pills, and started for home. </p>
        <p>My old woman proved a fast friend; and as she sent me numerous patients, I by
          and by altered my sign to "Homeopathic Physician and Surgeon,'' whatever that
          may mean, and was regarded by my medical brothers as a lost sheep, and by the
          little-pill doctors as one who had seen the error of his ways. </p>
        <p>In point of fact, my new practice had decided advantages. All pills looked and
          tasted alike, and the same might be said of the powders, so that I was never
          troubled by those absurd investigations into the nature of remedies which some
          patients are prone to <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0073" n="48"/> make. Of course
          I desired to get business, and it was therefore obviously unwise to give little
          pills of "Lac.,'' or "Puls.,'' or "Sep.,'' when a man needed a dose of oil, or a
          white-faced girl iron, or the like. I soon made the useful discovery that it was
          only necessary to prescribe cod-liver oil, for instance, as a diet, in order to
          make use of it where required. When a man got impatient over an ancient ague, I
          usually found, too, that I could persuade him to let me try a good dose of
          quinine; while, on the other hand, there was a distinct pecuniary advantage in
          those cases of the shakes which could be made to believe that it "was best not
          to interfere with nature.'' I ought to add that this kind of faith is uncommon
          among folks who carry hods or build walls. </p>
        <p>For women who are hysterical, and go heart and soul into the business of being
          sick, I have found the little pills a most charming resort, because you cannot
          carry the refinement of symptoms beyond what my friend Jahr has done in the way
          of fitting medicines to them, so that if I had taken seriously to practising
          this double form of therapeutics, it had, as I saw, certain conveniences. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0074" n="49"/>
        </p>
        <p>Another year went by, and I was beginning to prosper in my new mode of life. My
          medicines (being chiefly milk-sugar, with variations as to the labels) cost next
          to nothing; and as I charged pretty well for both these and my advice, I was now
          able to start a gig. </p>
        <p>I solemnly believe that I should have continued to succeed in the practice of
          my profession if it had not happened that fate was once more unkind to me, by
          throwing in my path one of my old acquaintances. I had a consultation one day
          with the famous homeopath Dr. Zwanzig. As we walked away we were busily
          discussing the case of a poor consumptive fellow who previously had lost a leg.
          In consequence of this defect, Dr. Zwanzig considered that the ten-thousandth of
          a grain of aurum would be an overdose, and that it must be fractioned so as to
          allow for the departed leg, otherwise the rest of the man would be getting a
          leg-dose too much. I was particularly struck with this view of the case, but I
          was still more, and less pleasingly, impressed at the sight of my former patient
          Stagers, who nodded to me familiarly from the opposite pavement. </p>
        <p>I was not at all surprised when, that evening quite late, I found this worthy
          waiting in <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0075" n="50"/> my office. I looked around
          uneasily, which was clearly understood by my friend, who retorted: "Ain't took
          nothin' of yours, doc. You don't seem right awful glad to see me. You need+n't
          be afraid &mdash; I+'ve only fetched you a job, and a right good one, too.'' </p>
        <p>I replied that I had my regular business, that I preferred he should get some
          one else, and pretty generally made Mr. Stagers aware that I had had enough of
          him. I did not ask him to sit down, and, just as I supposed him about to leave,
          he seated himself with a grin, remarking, "No use, doc; got to go into it this
          one time.'' </p>
        <p>At this I, naturally enough, grew angry and used several rather violent
          phrases. </p>
        <p>"No use, doc,'' said Stagers. </p>
        <p>Then I softened down, and laughed a little, and treated the thing as a joke,
          whatever it was, for I dreaded to hear. </p>
        <p>But Stagers was fate. Stagers was inevitable. "Won't do, doc &mdash; not
          even money would+n't get you off.'' </p>
        <p>"No?'' said I, interrogatively, and as coolly as I could, contriving at the
          same time to move toward the window. It was summer, the sashes were up, the
          shutters half drawn in, and a policeman whom I knew was lounging <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0076" n="51"/> opposite, as I had noticed when I
          entered. I would give Stagers a scare, charge him with theft &mdash;
          anything but get mixed up with his kind again. It was the folly of a moment and
          I should have paid dear for it. </p>
        <p>He must have understood me, the scoundrel, for in an instant I felt a cold ring
          of steel against my ear, and a tiger clutch on my cravat. "Sit down,'' he said.
          "What a fool you are! Guess you forgot that there coroner's business and the
          rest.'' Needless to say that I obeyed. "Best not try that again,'' continued my
          guest. "Wait a moment''; and rising, he closed the window. </p>
        <p>There was no resource left but to listen; and what followed I shall condense
          rather than relate it in the language employed by Mr. Stagers. </p>
        <p>It appeared that my other acquaintance Mr. File had been guilty of a
          cold-blooded and long-premeditated murder, for which he had been tried and
          convicted. He now lay in jail awaiting his execution, which was to take place at
          Carsonville, Ohio. It seemed that with Stagers and others he had formed a band
          of expert counterfeiters in the West. Their business lay in the manufacture of
          South American currencies. File had thus <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0077" n="52"
          /> acquired a fortune so considerable that I was amazed at his having allowed
          his passion to seduce him into unprofitable crime. In his agony he unfortunately
          thought of me, and had bribed Stagers largely in order that he might be induced
          to find me. When the narration had reached this stage, and I had been made fully
          to understand that I was now and hereafter under the sharp eye of Stagers and
          his friends, that, in a word, escape was out of the question, I turned on my
          tormentor. </p>
        <p>"What does all this mean?'' I said. "What does File expect me to do?'' </p>
        <p>"Don't believe he exactly knows,'' said Stagers. "Something or other to get him
          clear of hemp.'' </p>
        <p>"But what stuff!'' I replied. "How can I help him? What possible influence
          could I exert?'' </p>
        <p>"Can't say,'' answered Stagers, imperturbably. "File has a notion you+'re 'most
          cunning enough for anything. Best try something, doc.'' </p>
        <p>"And what if I won't do it?'' said I. "What does it matter to me if the rascal
          swings or no?'' </p>
        <p>"Keep cool, doc,'' returned Stagers. "I'm <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0078"/>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0079"/>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0080" n="55"/> only agent in this here business. My
          principal, that+'s File, he says: `Tell Sanderaft to find some way to get me
          clear. Once out, I give him ten thousand dollars. If he don't turn up something
          that will suit, I+'ll blow about that coroner business and Lou Wilson, and break
          him up generally.' '' </p>
        <p>"You don't mean,'' said I, in a cold sweat &mdash; "you don't mean that, if
          I can't do this impossible thing, he will inform on me?'' </p>
        <p>"Just so,'' returned Stagers. "Got a cigar, doc?'' </p>
        <p>I only half heard him. What a frightful position! I had been leading a happy
          and an increasingly profitable life &mdash; no scrapes and no dangers; and
          here, on a sudden, I had presented to me the alternative of saving a wretch from
          the gallows or of spending unlimited years in a State penitentiary. As for the
          money, it became as dead leaves for this once only in my life. My brain seemed
          to be spinning round. I grew weak all over. </p>
        <p>"Cheer up a little,'' said Stagers. "Take a nip of whisky. Things ain't at the
          worst, by a good bit. You just get ready, and we+'ll start by the morning train.
          Guess you+'ll try out something smart enough as we travel along. Ain't got a
          heap of time to lose.'' <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0081" n="56"/>
        </p>
        <p>I was silent. A great anguish had me in its grip. I might squirm as I would, it
          was all in vain. Hideous plans rose to my mind, born of this agony of terror. I
          might murder Stagers, but what good would that do? As to File, he was safe from
          my hand. At last I became too confused to think any longer. "When do we leave?''
          I said feebly. </p>
        <p>"At six to-morrow,'' he returned. </p>
        <p>How I was watched and guarded, and how hurried over a thousand miles of rail to
          my fate, little concerns us now. I find it dreadful to recall it to memory.
          Above all, an aching eagerness for revenge upon the man who had caused me these
          sufferings was uppermost in my mind. Could I not fool the wretch and save
          myself? Of a sudden an idea came into my consciousness. Then it grew and formed
          itself, became possible, probable, seemed to me sure. "Ah,'' said I, "Stagers,
          give me something to eat and drink.'' I had not tasted food for two days. </p>
        <p>Within a day or two after my arrival, I was enabled to see File in his cell, on
          the plea of being a clergyman from his native place. </p>
        <p>I found that I had not miscalculated my danger. The man did not appear to have
          the <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0082" n="57"/> least idea as to how I was to help
          him. He only knew that I was in his power, and he used his control to insure
          that something more potent than friendship should be enlisted in his behalf. As
          the days went by, his behavior grew to be a frightful thing to witness. He
          threatened, flattered, implored, offered to double the sum he had promised if I
          would save him. My really reasonable first thought was to see the governor of
          the State, and, as Stagers's former physician, make oath to his having had many
          attacks of epilepsy followed by brief periods of homicidal mania. He had, in
          fact, had fits of alcoholic epilepsy. Unluckily, the governor was in a distant
          city. The time was short, and the case against my man too clear. Stagers said it
          would not do. I was at my wit's end. "Got to do something,'' said File, "or
          I+'ll attend to your case, doc.'' </p>
        <p>"But,'' said I, "suppose there is really nothing?'' </p>
        <p>"Well,'' said Stagers to me when we were alone, "you get him satisfied, anyhow.
          He+'ll never let them hang him, and perhaps &mdash; well, I+'m going to give
          him these pills when I get a chance. He asked to have them. But what+'s your
          other plan?'' <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0083" n="58"/>
        </p>
        <p>Stagers knew as much about medicine as a pig knows about the opera. So I set to
          work to delude him, first asking if he could secure me, as a clergyman, an hour
          alone with File just before the execution. He said money would do it, and what
          was my plan? </p>
        <p>"Well,'' said I, "there was once a man named Dr. Chovet. He lived in London. A
          gentleman who turned highwayman was to be hanged. You see,'' said I, "this was
          about 1760. Well, his friends bribed the jailer and the hangman. The doctor cut
          a hole in the man's windpipe, very low down where it could be partly hid by a
          loose cravat. So, as they hanged him only a little while, and the breath went in
          and out of the opening below the noose, he was only just insensible when his
          friends got him &mdash; '' </p>
        <p>"And he got well,'' cried Stagers, much pleased with my rather melodramatic
          tale. </p>
        <p>"Yes,'' I said, "he got well, and lived to take purses, all dressed in white.
          People had known him well, and when he robbed his great-aunt, who was not in the
          secret, she swore she had seen his ghost.'' </p>
        <p>Stagers said that was a fine story; guessed it would work; small town, new
          business, lots of money to use. In fact, the attempt thus to <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0084" n="59"/> save a man is said to have been made,
          but, by ill luck, the man did not recover. It answered my purpose, but how any
          one, even such an ass as this fellow, could believe it could succeed puzzles me
          to this day. </p>
        <p>File became enthusiastic over my scheme, and I cordially assisted his
          credulity. The thing was to keep the wretch quiet until the business blew up or
          &mdash; and I shuddered &mdash; until File, in despair, took his pill. I
          should in any case find it wise to leave in haste. </p>
        <p>My friend Stagers had some absurd misgivings lest Mr. File's neck might be
          broken by the fall; but as to this I was able to reassure him upon the best
          scientific authority. There were certain other and minor questions, as to the
          effect of sudden, nearly complete arrest of the supply of blood to the brain;
          but with these physiological refinements I thought it needlessly cruel to
          distract a man in File's peculiar position. Perhaps I shall be doing injustice
          to my own intellect if I do not hasten to state again that I had not the
          remotest belief in the efficacy of my plan for any purpose except to get me out
          of a very uncomfortable position and give me, with time, a chance to escape. </p>
        <p>Stagers and I were both disguised as <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0085" n="60"/>
          clergymen, and were quite freely admitted to the condemned man's cell. In fact,
          there was in the little town a certain trustful simplicity about all their
          arrangements. The day but one before the execution Stagers informed me that File
          had the pills, which he, Stagers, had contrived to give him. Stagers seemed
          pleased with our plan. I was not. He was vreally getting uneasy and suspicious
          of me &mdash; as I was soon to find out. </p>
        <p>So far our plans, or rather mine, had worked to a marvel. Certain of File's old
          accomplices succeeded in bribing the hangman to shorten the time of suspension.
          Arrangements were made to secure me two hours alone with the prisoner, so that
          nothing seemed to be wanting to this tomfool business. I had assured Stagers
          that I would not need to see File again previous to the operation; but in the
          forenoon of the day before that set for the execution I was seized with a
          feverish impatience, which luckily prompted me to visit him once more. As usual,
          I was admitted readily, and nearly reached his cell when I became aware, from
          the sound of voices heard through the grating in the door, that there was a
          visitor in the cell. "Who is with him?'' I inquired of the turnkey. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0086" n="61"/>
        </p>
        <p>"The doctor,'' he replied. </p>
        <p>"Doctor?'' I said, pausing. "What doctor?'' </p>
        <p>"Oh, the jail doctor. I was to come back in half an hour to let him out; but
          he+'s got a quarter to stay. Shall I let you in, or will you wait?'' </p>
        <p>"No,'' I replied; "it is hardly right to interrupt them. I will walk in the
          corridor for ten minutes or so, and then you can come back to let me into the
          cell.'' </p>
        <p>"Very good,'' he returned, and left me. </p>
        <p>As soon as I was alone, I cautiously advanced until I stood alongside of the
          door, through the barred grating of which I was able readily to hear what went
          on within. The first words I caught were these: </p>
        <p>"And you tell me, doctor, that, even if a man's windpipe was open, the hanging
          would kill him &mdash; are you sure?'' </p>
        <p>"Yes, I believe there would be no doubt of it. I cannot see how escape would be
          possible. But let me ask you why you have sent for me to ask these singular
          questions. You cannot have the faintest hope of escape, and least of all in such
          a manner as this. I advise you to think about the fate which is inevitable. You
          must, I fear, have much to reflect upon.'' <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0087"
            n="62"/>
        </p>
        <p>"But,'' said File, "if I wanted to try this plan of mine, could+n't some one be
          found to help me, say if he was to make twenty thousand or so by it? I mean a
          really good doctor.'' Evidently File cruelly mistrusted my skill, and meant to
          get some one to aid me. </p>
        <p>"If you mean me,'' answered the doctor, "some one cannot be found, neither for
          twenty nor fifty thousand dollars. Besides, if any one were wicked enough to
          venture on such an attempt, he would only be deceiving you with a hope which
          would be utterly vain. You must be off your head.'' </p>
        <p>I understood all this with an increasing fear in my mind. I had meant to get
          away that night at all risks. I saw now that I must go at once. </p>
        <p>After a pause he said: "Well, doctor, you know a poor devil in my fix will
          clutch at straws. Hope I have not offended you.'' </p>
        <p>"Not in the least,'' returned the doctor. "Shall I send you Mr. Smith?'' This
          was my present name; in fact, I was known as the Rev. Eliphalet Smith. </p>
        <p>"I would like it,'' answered File; "but as you go out, tell the warden I want
          to see him immediately about a matter of great importance.'' <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0088" n="63"/>
        </p>
        <p>At this stage I began to apprehend very distinctly that the time had arrived
          when it would be wiser for me to delay escape no longer. Accordingly, I waited
          until I heard the doctor rise, and at once stepped quietly away to the far end
          of the corridor. I had scarcely reached it when the door which closed it was
          opened by a turnkey who had come to relieve the doctor and let me into the cell.
          Of course my peril was imminent. If the turnkey mentioned my near presence to
          the prisoner, immediate disclosure would follow. If some lapse of time were
          secured before the warden obeyed the request from File that he should visit him,
          I might gain thus a much-needed hour, but hardly more. I therefore said to the
          officer: "Tell the warden that the doctor wishes to remain an hour longer with
          the prisoner, and that I shall return myself at the end of that time.'' </p>
        <p>"Very good, sir,'' said the turnkey, allowing me to pass out, and, as he
          followed me, relocking the door of the corridor. "I+'ll tell him,'' he said. It
          is needless to repeat that I never had the least idea of carrying out the
          ridiculous scheme with which I had deluded File and Stagers, but so far
          Stagers's watchfulness had given me no chance to escape. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0089" n="64"/>
        </p>
        <p>In a few moments I was outside of the jail gate, and saw my fellow-clergyman,
          Mr. Stagers, in full broadcloth and white tie, coming down the street toward me.
          As usual, he was on his guard; but this time he had to deal with a man grown
          perfectly desperate, with everything to win and nothing to lose. My plans were
          made, and, wild as they were, I thought them worth the trying. I must evade this
          man's terrible watch. How keen it was, you cannot imagine; but it was aided by
          three of the infamous gang to which File had belonged, for without these spies
          no one person could possibly have sustained so perfect a system. </p>
        <p>I took Stagers's arm. "What time,'' said I, "does the first train start for
          Dayton?'' </p>
        <p>"At twelve. What do you want?'' </p>
        <p>"How far is it?'' </p>
        <p>"About fifteen miles,'' he replied. v</p>
        <p>"Good. I can get back by eight o'clock to-night.'' </p>
        <p>"Easily,'' said Stagers, "if you go. What do you want?'' </p>
        <p>"I want a smaller tube to put in the wind-pipe &mdash; must have it, in
          fact.'' </p>
        <p>"Well, I don't like it,'' said he, "but the thing+'s got to go through somehow.
          If you <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0090" n="65"/> must go, I will go along
          myself. Can't lose sight of you, doc, just at present. You+'re monstrous
          precious. Did you tell File?'' </p>
        <p>"Yes,'' said I; "he+'s all right. Come. We+'ve no time to lose.'' </p>
        <p>Nor had we. Within twenty minutes we were seated in the last car of a long
          train, and running at the rate of twenty miles an hour toward Dayton. In about
          ten minutes I asked Stagers for a cigar. </p>
        <p>"Can't smoke here,'' said he. </p>
        <p>"No,'' I answered; "of course not. I+'ll go forward into the smoking-car.'' </p>
        <p>"Come along,'' said he, and we went through the train. </p>
        <p>I was not sorry he had gone with me when I found in the smoking-car one of the
          spies who had been watching me so constantly. Stagers nodded to him and grinned
          at me, and we sat down together. </p>
        <p>"Chut!'' said I, "left my cigar on the window-ledge in the hindmost car. Be
          back in a moment.'' </p>
        <p>This time, for a wonder, Stagers allowed me to leave unaccompanied. I hastened
          through to the nearer end of the hindmost car, and stood on the platform. I
          instantly cut the signal-cord. Then I knelt down, and, <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0091" n="66"/> waiting until the two cars ran together,
          I tugged at the connecting-pin. As the cars came together, I could lift it a
          little, then as the strain came on the coupling the pin held fast. At last I
          made a great effort, and out it came. The car I was on instantly lost speed, and
          there on the other platform, a hundred feet away, was Stagers shaking his fist
          at me. He was beaten, and he knew it. In the end few people have been able to
          get ahead of me. </p>
        <p>The retreating train was half a mile away around the curve as I screwed up the
          brake on my car hard enough to bring it nearly to a stand. I did not wait for it
          to stop entirely before I slipped off the steps, leaving the other passengers to
          dispose of themselves as they might until their absence should be discovered and
          the rest of the train return. </p>
        <p>As I wish rather to illustrate my very remarkable professional career than to
          amuse by describing its lesser incidents, I shall not linger to tell how I
          succeeded, at last, in reaching St. Louis. Fortunately, I had never ceased to
          anticipate the moment when escape from File and his friends would be possible,
          so that I always carried about with me the very small funds with which I had
          hastily <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0092" n="67"/> provided myself upon leaving.
          The whole amount did not exceed sixty-five dollars, but with this, and a gold
          watch worth twice as much, I hoped to be able to subsist until my own ingenuity
          enabled me to provide more liberally for the future. Naturally enough, I scanned
          the papers closely to discover some account of File's death and of the
          disclosures concerning myself which he was only too likely to have made. </p>
        <p>I came at last on an account of how he had poisoned himself, and so escaped the
          hangman. I never learned what he had said about me, but I was quite sure he had
          not let me off easy. I felt that this failure to announce his confessions was
          probably due to a desire on the part of the police to avoid alarming me. Be this
          as it may, I remained long ignorant as to whether or not the villain betrayed my
          part in that unusual coroner's inquest. </p>
        <p>Before many days I had resolved to make another and a bold venture. Accordingly
          appeared in the St. Louis papers an advertisement to the effect that Dr. von
          Ingenhoff, the well-known German physician, who had spent two years on the
          Plains acquiring a knowledge of Indian medicine, was prepared to treat all
          diseases by vegetable remedies alone. <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0093" n="68"/>
          Dr. von Ingenhoff would remain in St. Louis for two weeks, and was to be found
          at the Grayson House every day from ten until two o'clock. </p>
        <p>To my delight, I got two patients the first day. The next I had twice as many,
          when at once I hired two connecting rooms, and made a very useful arrangement,
          which I may describe dramatically in the following way: </p>
        <p>There being two or three patients waiting while I finished my cigar and morning
          julep, enters a respectable-looking old gentleman who inquires briskly of the
          patients if this is really Dr. von Ingenhoff's. He is told it is. My friend was
          apt to overact his part. I had often occasion to ask him to be less positive. </p>
        <p>"Ah,'' says he, "I shall be delighted to see the doctor. Five years ago I was
          scalped on the Plains, and now'' &mdash; exhibiting a well-covered head
          &mdash; "you see what the doctor did for me. 'T is+n't any wonder I+'ve come
          fifty miles to see him. Any of you been scalped, gentlemen?'' </p>
        <p>To none of them had this misfortune arrived as yet; but, like most folks in the
          lower ranks of life and some in the upper ones, it was pleasant to find a genial
          person who <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0094"/>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0095"/>> <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0096" n="71"/>
          would listen to their account of their own symptoms. </p>
        <p>Presently, after hearing enough, the old gentleman pulls out a large watch.
          "Bless me! it+'s late. I must call again. May I trouble you, sir, to say to the
          doctor that his old friend called to see him and will drop in again to-morrow?
          Don't forget: Governor Brown of Arkansas.'' A moment later the governor visited
          me by a side door, with his account of the symptoms of my patients. </p>
        <p>Enter a tall Hoosier, the governor having retired. "Now, doc,'' says the
          Hoosier, "I+'ve been handled awful these two years back.'' "Stop!'' I exclaimed.
          "Open your eyes. There, now, let me see,'' taking his pulse as I speak. "Ah,
          you+'ve a pain there, and there, and you can't sleep; cocktails don't agree any
          longer. Were+n't you bit by a dog two years ago?'' "I was,'' says the Hoosier,
          in amazement. "Sir,'' I reply, "you have chronic hydrophobia. It+'s the water in
          the cocktails that disagrees with you. My bitters will cure you in a week, sir.
          No more whisky &mdash; drink milk.'' </p>
        <p>The astonishment of my patient at these accurate revelations may be imagined.
          He is allowed to wait for his medicine in the ante- <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0097" n="72"/> room, where the chances are in favor of
          his relating how wonderfully I had told all his symptoms at a glance. </p>
        <p>Governor Brown of Arkansas was a small but clever actor, whom I met in the
          billiard-room, and who day after day, in varying disguises and modes, played off
          the same tricks, to our great common advantage. </p>
        <p>At my friend's suggestion, we very soon added to our resources by the purchase
          of two electromagnetic batteries. This special means of treating all classes of
          maladies has advantages which are altogether peculiar. In the first place, you
          instruct your patient that the treatment is of necessity a long one. A striking
          mode of putting it is to say, "Sir, you have been six months getting ill; it
          will require six months for a cure.'' There is a correct sound about such a
          phrase, and it is sure to satisfy. Two sittings a week, at two dollars a
          sitting, will pay. In many cases the patient gets well while you are
          electrifying him. Whether or not the electricity cured him is a thing I shall
          never know. If, however, he began to show signs of impatience, I advised him
          that he would require a year's treatment, and suggested that it would be
          economical for him to buy a battery and use <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0098"
            n="73"/> it at home. Thus advised, he pays you twenty dollars for an
          instrument which cost you ten, and you are rid of a troublesome case. </p>
        <p>If the reader has followed me closely, he will have learned that I am a man of
          large and liberal views in my profession, and of a very justifiable ambition.
          The idea has often occurred to me of combining in one establishment all the
          various modes of practice which are known as irregular. This, as will be
          understood, is really only a wider application of the idea which prompted me to
          unite in my own business homeopathy and the practice of medicine. I proposed to
          my partner, accordingly, to combine with our present business that of
          spiritualism, which I knew had been very profitably turned to account in
          connection with medical practice. As soon as he agreed to this plan, which, by
          the way, I hoped to enlarge so as to include all the available isms, I set about
          making such preparations as were necessary. I remembered having read somewhere
          that a Dr. Schiff had shown that he could produce remarkable "knockings,'' so
          called, by voluntarily dislocating the great toe and then forcibly drawing it
          back into its socket. A still better noise could be made by throwing the tendon
          of the peroneus longus <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0099" n="74"/> muscle out of
          the hollow in which it lies, alongside of the ankle. After some effort I was
          able to accomplish both feats quite readily, and could occasion a remarkable
          variety of sounds, according to the power which I employed or the positions
          which I occupied at the time. As to all other matters, I trusted to the
          suggestions of my own ingenuity, which, as a rule, has rarely failed me. </p>
        <p>The largest success attended the novel plan which my lucky genius had devised,
          so that soon we actually began to divide large profits and to lay by a portion
          of our savings. It is, of course, not to be supposed that this desirable result
          was attained without many annoyances and some positive danger. My spiritual
          revelations, medical and other, were, as may be supposed, only more or less
          happy guesses; but in this, as in predictions as to the weather and other
          events, the rare successes always get more prominence in the minds of men than
          the numerous failures. Moreover, whenever a person has been fool enough to
          resort to folks like myself, he is always glad to be able to defend his conduct
          by bringing forward every possible proof of skill on the part of the men he has
          consulted. These considerations, and a certain love of mysterious <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0100" n="75"/> or unusual means, I have commonly found
          sufficient to secure an ample share of gullible individuals. I may add, too,
          that those who would be shrewd enough to understand and expose us are wise
          enough to keep away altogether. Such as did come were, as a rule, easy enough to
          manage, but now and then we hit upon some utterly exceptional patient who was
          both foolish enough to consult us and sharp enough to know he had been swindled.
          When such a fellow made a fuss, it was occasionally necessary to return his
          money if it was found impossible to bully him into silence. In one or two
          instances, where I had promised a cure upon prepayment of two or three hundred
          dollars, I was either sued or threatened with suit, and had to refund a part or
          the whole of the amount; but most people preferred to hold their tongues rather
          than expose to the world the extent of their own folly. </p>
        <p>In one most disastrous case I suffered personally to a degree which I never can
          recall without a distinct sense of annoyance, both at my own want of care and at
          the disgusting consequences which it brought upon me. </p>
        <p>Early one morning an old gentleman called, in a state of the utmost agitation,
          and ex- <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0101" n="76"/> plained that he desired to
          consult the spirits as to a heavy loss which he had experienced the night
          before. He had left, he said, a sum of money in his pantaloons pocket upon going
          to bed. In the morning he had changed his clothes and gone out, forgetting to
          remove the notes. Returning in an hour in great haste, he discovered that the
          garment still lay upon the chair where he had thrown it, but that the money was
          missing. I at once desired him to be seated, and proceeded to ask him certain
          questions, in a chatty way, about the habits of his household, the amount lost,
          and the like, expecting thus to get some clue which would enable me to make my
          spirits display the requisite share of sagacity in pointing out the thief. I
          learned readily that he was an old and wealthy man, a little close, too, I
          suspected, and that he lived in a large house with but two servants, and an only
          son about twenty-one years old. The servants were both women who had lived in
          the household many years, and were probably innocent. Unluckily, remembering my
          own youthful career, I presently reached the conclusion that the young man had
          been the delinquent. When I ventured to inquire a little as to his habits, the
          old gentleman cut me very short, remarking <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0102"
            n="77"/> that he came to ask questions, and not to be questioned, and that he
          desired at once to consult the spirits. Upon this I sat down at a table, and,
          after a brief silence, demanded in a solemn voice if there were any spirits
          present. By industriously cracking my big toe-joint I was enabled to represent
          at once the presence of a numerous assembly of these worthies. Then I inquired
          if any one of them had been present when the robbery was effected. A prompt
          double knock replied in the affirmative. I may say here, by the way, that the
          unanimity of the spirits as to their use of two knocks for "yes'' and one for
          "no'' is a very remarkable point, and shows, if it shows anything, how perfect
          and universal must be the social intercourse of the respected departed. It is
          worthy of note, also, that if the spirit &mdash; I will not say the medium
          &mdash; perceives after one knock that it were wiser to say yes, he can
          conveniently add the second tap. Some such arrangement in real life would, it
          appears to me, be highly desirable. </p>
        <p>It seemed that the spirit was that of Vidocq, the French detective. I had just
          read a translation of his memoirs, and he seemed to me a very available spirit
          to call upon. </p>
        <p>As soon as I explained that the spirit who <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0103"
            n="78"/> answered had been a witness of the theft, the old man became
          strangely agitated. "Who was it?'' said he. At once the spirit indicated a
          desire to use the alphabet. As we went over the letters, &mdash; always a
          slow method, but useful when you want to observe excitable people, &mdash;
          my visitor kept saying, "Quicker &mdash; go quicker.'' At length the spirit
          spelled out the words, "I know not his name.'' </p>
        <p>"Was it,'' said the gentleman &mdash; "was it a &mdash; was it one of
          my household?'' </p>
        <p>I knocked "yes'' without hesitation; who else, indeed, could it have been? </p>
        <p>"Excuse me,'' he went on, "if I ask you for a little whisky.'' </p>
        <p>This I gave him. He continued: "Was it Susan or Ellen?'' </p>
        <p>"No, no!'' </p>
        <p>"Was it &mdash; '' He paused. "If I ask a question mentally, will the
          spirits reply?'' I knew what he meant. He wanted to ask if it was his son, but
          did not wish to speak openly. </p>
        <p>"Ask,'' said I. </p>
        <p>"I have,'' he returned. </p>
        <p>I hesitated. It was rarely my policy to commit myself definitely, yet here I
          fancied, from the facts of the case and his own terrible anxiety, that he
          suspected, or more than <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0104" n="79"/> suspected, his
          son as the guilty person. I became sure of this as I studied his face. At all
          events, it would be easy to deny or explain in case of trouble; and, after all,
          what slander was there in two knocks? I struck twice as usual. </p>
        <p>Instantly the old gentleman rose up, very white, but quite firm. "There,'' he
          said, and cast a bank-note on the table, "I thank you,'' and bending his head on
          his breast, walked, as I thought, with great effort out of the room. </p>
        <p>On the following morning, as I made my first appearance in my outer room, which
          contained at least a dozen persons awaiting advice, who should I see standing by
          the window but the old gentleman with sandy-gray hair? Along with him was a
          stout young man with a head as red as mine, and mustache and whiskers to match.
          Probably the son, I thought &mdash; ardent temperament, remorse, come to
          confess, etc. I was never more mistaken in my life. I was about to go regularly
          through my patients when the old gentleman began to speak. </p>
        <p>"I called, doctor,'' said he, "to explain the little matter about which I
          &mdash; about which I &mdash; '' </p>
        <p>"Troubled your spirits yesterday,'' added the youth, jocosely, pulling his
          mustache. <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0105" n="80"/>
        </p>
        <p>"Beg pardon,'' I returned; "had we not better talk this over in private? Come
          into my office,'' I added, touching the younger man on the arm. </p>
        <p>Would you believe it? he took out his handkerchief and dusted the place I had
          touched. "Better not,'' said he. "Go on, father; let us get done with this
          den.'' </p>
        <p>"Gentlemen,'' said the elder person, addressing the patients, "I called here
          yesterday, like a fool, to ask who had stolen from me a sum of money which I
          believed I left in my room on going out in the morning. This doctor here and his
          spirits contrived to make me suspect my only son. Well, I charged him at once
          with the crime as soon as I got back home, and what do you think he did? He
          said, `Father, let us go up-stairs and look for it,' and &mdash; '' </p>
        <p>Here the young man broke in with: "Come, father; don't worry yourself for
          nothing''; and then turning, added: "To cut the thing short, he found the notes
          under his candle-stick, where he left them on going to bed. This is all of it.
          We came here to stop this fellow'' (by which he meant me) "from carrying a
          slander further. I advise you, good people, to profit by the matter, and to look
          up <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0106" n="81"/> a more honest doctor, if doctoring
          be what you want.'' </p>
        <p>As soon as he had ended, I remarked solemnly: "The words of the spirits are not
          my words. Who shall hold them accountable?'' </p>
        <p>"Nonsense,'' said the young man. "Come, father''; and they left the room. </p>
        <p>Now was the time to retrieve my character. "Gentlemen,'' said I, "you have
          heard this very singular account. Trusting the spirits utterly and entirely as I
          do, it occurs to me that there is no reason why they may not, after all, have
          been right in their suspicions of this young person. Who can say that, overcome
          by remorse, he may not have seized the time of his father's absence to replace
          the money?'' </p>
        <p>To my amazement, up gets a little old man from the corner. "Well, you are a low
          cuss!'' said he, and taking up a basket beside him, hobbled hastily out of the
          room. You may be sure I said some pretty sharp things to him, for I was out of
          humor to begin with, and it is one thing to be insulted by a stout young man,
          and quite another to be abused by a wretched old cripple. However, he went away,
          and I supposed, for my part, that I was done with the whole business. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0107" n="82"/>
        </p>
        <p>An hour later, however, I heard a rough knock at my door, and opening it
          hastily, saw my red-headed young man with the cripple. </p>
        <p>"Now,'' said the former, taking me by the collar, and pulling me into the room
          among my patients, "I want to know, my man, if this doctor said that it was
          likely I was the thief after all?'' </p>
        <p>"That+'s what he said,'' replied the cripple; "just about that, sir.'' </p>
        <p>I do not desire to dwell on the after conduct of this hot-headed young man. It
          was the more disgraceful as I offered but little resistance, and endured a
          beating such as I would have hesitated to inflict upon a dog. Nor was this all.
          He warned me that if I dared to remain in the city after a week he would shoot
          me. In the East I should have thought but little of such a threat, but here it
          was only too likely to be practically carried out. Accordingly, with my usual
          decision of character, but with much grief and reluctance, I collected my whole
          fortune, which now amounted to at least seven thousand dollars, and turned my
          back upon this ungrateful town. I am sorry to say that I also left behind me the
          last of my good luck. </p>
        <p>I traveled in a leisurely way until I reached <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0108"/>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0109"/>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0110" n="85"/> Boston. The country anywhere would
          have been safer, but I do not lean to agricultural pursuits. It seemed an
          agreeable city, and I decided to remain. </p>
        <p>I took good rooms at Parker's, and concluding to enjoy life, amused myself in
          the company of certain, I may say uncertain, young women who danced at some of
          the theaters. I played billiards, drank rather too much, drove fast horses, and
          at the end of a delightful year was shocked to find myself in debt, and with
          only seven dollars and fifty-three cents left &mdash; I like to be accurate.
          I had only one resource: I determined to visit my deaf aunt and Peninnah, and to
          see what I could do in the r&ocirc;le of the prodigal nephew. At all events,
          I should gain time to think of what new enterprise I could take up; but, above
          all, I needed a little capital and a house over my head. I had pawned nearly
          everything of any value which I possessed. </p>
        <p>I left my debts to gather interest, and went away to Woodbury. It was the day
          before Christmas when I reached the little Jersey town, and it was also by good
          luck Sunday I was hungry and quite penniless. I wandered about until church had
          begun, because I was sure then to find Aunt Rachel and <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0111" n="86"/> Peninnah out at the service, and I
          desired to explore a little. The house was closed, and even the one servant
          absent. I got in with ease at the back through the kitchen, and having at least
          an hour and a half free from interruption, I made a leisurely search. The
          r&ocirc;le of prodigal was well enough, but here was a better chance and an
          indulgent opportunity. </p>
        <p>In a few moments I found the famous Bible hid away under Aunt Rachel's
          mattress. The Bible bank was fat with notes, but I intended to be moderate
          enough to escape suspicion. Here were quite two thousand dollars. I resolved to
          take, just now, only one hundred, so as to keep a good balance. Then, alas! I
          lit on a long envelop, my aunt's will. Every cent was left to Christ Church; not
          a dime to poor Pen or to me. I was in a rage. I tore up the will and replaced
          the envelop. To treat poor Pen that way &mdash; Pen of all people! There was
          a heap more will than testament, for all it was in the Bible. After that I
          thought it was right to punish the old witch, and so I took every note I could
          find. When I was through with this business, I put back the Bible under the
          mattress, and observing that I had been quite too long, I went down- <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0112" n="87"/> stairs with a keen desire to leave the
          town as early as possible. I was tempted, however, to look further, and was
          rewarded by finding in an old clock case a small reticule stuffed with
          bank-notes. This I appropriated, and made haste to go out. I was too late. As I
          went into the little entry to get my hat and coat, Aunt Rachel entered, followed
          by Peninnah. </p>
        <p>At sight of me my aunt cried out that I was a monster and fit for the
          penitentiary. As she could not hear at all, she had the talk to herself, and
          went by me and up-stairs, rumbling abuse like distant thunder overhead. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile I was taken up with Pen. The pretty fool was seated on a chair, all
          dressed up in her Sunday finery, and rocking backward and forward, crying, "Oh,
          oh, ah!'' like a lamb saying, "Baa, baa, baa!'' She never had much sense. I had
          to shake her to get a reasonable word. She mopped her eyes, and I heard her gasp
          out that my aunt had at last decided that I was the person who had thinned her
          hoards. This was bad, but involved less inconvenience than it might have done an
          hour earlier. Amid tears Pen told me that a detective had been at the house
          inquiring for me. When this happened it seems that the <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0113" n="88"/> poor little goose had tried to fool deaf
          Aunt Rachel with some made-up story as to the man having come about taxes. I
          suppose the girl was not any too sharp, and the old woman, I guess, read enough
          from merely seeing the man's lips. You never could keep anything from her, and
          she was both curious and suspicious. She assured the officer that I was a thief,
          and hoped I might be caught. I could not learn whether the man told Pen any
          particulars, but as I was slowly getting at the facts we heard a loud scream and
          a heavy fall. </p>
        <p>Pen said, "Oh, oh!'' and we hurried up-stairs. There was the old woman on the
          floor, her face twitching to right, and her breathing a sort of hoarse croak.
          The big Bible lay open on the floor, and I knew what had happened. It was a fit
          of apoplexy. </p>
        <p>At this very unpleasant sight Pen seemed to recover her wits, and said: "Go
          away, go away! Oh, brother, brother, now I know you have stolen her money and
          killed her, and &mdash; and I loved you, I was so proud of you! Oh, oh!'' </p>
        <p>This was all very fine, but the advice was good. I said: "Yes, I had better go.
          Run and get some one &mdash; a doctor. It is a fit of <pb
            n="DSSR_000002082_0114"/>
          <pb n="DSSR_000002082_0115"/>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0116" n="91"/> hysterics; there is no danger. I will
          write to you. You are quite mistaken.'' </p>
        <p>This was too feeble even for Pen, and she cried: </p>
        <p>"No, never; I never want to see you again. You would kill me next.'' </p>
        <p>"Stuff!'' said I, and ran down-stairs. I seized my coat and hat, and went to
          the tavern, where I got a man to drive me to Camden. I have never seen Pen
          since. As I crossed the ferry to Philadelphia I saw that I should have asked
          when the detective had been after me. I suspected from Pen's terror that it had
          been recently. </p>
        <p>It was Sunday and, as I reminded myself, the day before Christmas. The ground
          was covered with snow, and as I walked up Market street my feet were soon
          soaked. In my haste I had left my overshoes. I was very cold, and, as I now see,
          foolishly fearful. I kept thinking of what a conspicuous thing a fire-red head
          is, and of how many people knew me. As I reached Woodbury early and without a
          cent, I had eaten nothing all day. I relied on Pen. </p>
        <p>Now I concluded to go down into my old neighborhood and get a lodging where no
          references were asked. Next day I would <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0117" n="92"
          /> secure a disguise and get out of the way. I had passed the day without food,
          as I have just said, and having ample means, concluded to go somewhere and get a
          good dinner. It was now close to three in the afternoon. I was aware of two
          things: that I was making many plans, and giving them up as soon as made; and
          that I was suddenly afraid without cause, afraid to enter an eating-house, and
          in fear of every man I met. </p>
        <p>I went on, feeling more and more chilly. When a man is really cold his mind
          does not work well, and now it was blowing a keen gale from the north. At Second
          and South I came plump on a policeman I knew. He looked at me through the
          drifting snow, as if he was uncertain, and twice looked back after having passed
          me. I turned west at Christian street. When I looked behind me the man was
          standing at the corner, staring after me. At the next turn I hurried away
          northward in a sort of anguish of terror. I have said I was an uncommon person.
          I am. I am sensitive, too. My mind is much above the average, but unless I am
          warm and well fed it does not act well, and I make mistakes. At that time I was
          half frozen, in need of food, and absurdly scared. Then that old fool <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0118" n="93"/> squirming on the floor got on to my
          nerves. I went on and on, and at last into Second street, until I came to Christ
          Church, of all places for me. I heard the sound of the organ in the afternoon
          service. I felt I must go in and get warm. Here was another silly notion: I was
          afraid of hotels, but not of the church. I reasoned vaguely that it was a dark
          day, and darker in the church, and so I went in at the Church Alley entrance and
          sat near the north door. No one noticed me. I sat still in a high-backed pew,
          well hid, and wondering what was the matter with me. It was curious that a
          doctor, and a man of my intelligence, should have been long in guessing a thing
          so simple. </p>
        <p>For two months I had been drinking hard, and for two days had quit, being a man
          capable of great self-control, and also being short of money. Just before the
          benediction I saw a man near by who seemed to stare at me. In deadly fear I got
          up and quickly slipped through a door into the tower room. I said to myself, "He
          will follow me or wait outside.'' I stood a moment with my head all of a whirl,
          and then in a shiver of fear ran up the stairs to the tower until I got into the
          bell-ringer's room. I was safe. I <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0119" n="94"/> sat
          down on a stool, twitching and tremulous. There were the old books on
          bell-ringing, and the miniature chime of small bells for instruction. The wind
          had easy entrance, and it swung the eight ropes about in a way I did not like. I
          remember saying, "Oh, don't do that.'' At last I had a mad desire to ring one of
          the bells. As a loop of rope swung toward me it seemed to hold a face, and this
          face cried out, "Come and hang yourself; then the bell will ring.'' </p>
        <p>If I slept I do not know. I may have done so. Certainly I must have stayed
          there many hours. I was dull and confused, and yet on my guard, for when far
          into the night I heard noises below, I ran up the steeper steps which ascend to
          the steeple, where are the bells. Half-way up I sat down on the stair. The place
          was cold and the darkness deep. Then I heard the eight ringers down below. One
          said: "Never knowed a Christmas like this since Zeb Sanderaft died. Come,
          boys!'' I knew it must be close on to mid-night. Now they would play a Christmas
          carol. I used every Christmas to be roused up and carried here and set on dad's
          shoulder. When they were done ringing, Number Two always gave me a box of
          sugar-plums and a <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0120" n="95"/> large red apple. As
          they rang off, my father would cry out, "One, two,'' and so on, and then cry,
          "Elias, all over town people are opening windows to listen.'' I seemed to hear
          him as I sat in the gloom. Then I heard, "All ready; one, two,'' and they rang
          the Christmas carol. Overhead I heard the great bells ringing out: And all the
          bells on earth shall ring On Christmas day, on Christmas day. </p>
        <p>I felt suddenly excited, and began to hum the air. Great heavens! There was the
          old woman, Aunt Rachel, with her face going twitch, twitch, the croak of her
          breathing keeping a sort of mad time with "On Christmas day, on Christmas day.''
          I Jumped up. She was gone. I knew in a hazy sort of way what was the matter with
          me, but I had still the sense to sit down and wait. I said now it would be
          snakes, for once before I had been almost as bad. But what I did see was a
          little curly-headed boy in a white frock and pantalets, climbing up the stairs
          right leg first; so queer of me to have noticed that. I knew I was that boy. He
          was an innocent-looking little chap, and was smiling. He seemed to me to grow
          and grow, and at last <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0121" n="96"/> was a big,
          red-headed man with a live rat in his hand. I saw nothing more, but I surely
          knew I needed whisky. I waited until all was still, and got down and out, for I
          knew every window. I soon found a tavern, and got a drink and some food. At once
          my fear left me. I was warm at last and clear of head, and had again my natural
          courage. I was well aware that I was on the edge of delirium tremens and must be
          most prudent. I paid in advance for my room and treated myself as I had done
          many another. Only a man of unusual force could have managed his own case as I
          did. I went out only at night, and in a week was well enough to travel. During
          this time I saw now and then that grinning little fellow. Sometimes he had an
          apple and was eating it. I do not know why he was worse to me than snakes, or
          the twitchy old woman with her wide eyes of glass, and that jerk, jerk, to
          right. </p>
        <p>I decided to go back to Boston. I got to New York prudently in a roundabout
          way, and in two weeks' time was traveling east from Albany. </p>
        <p>I felt well, and my spirits began at last to rise to their usual level. When I
          arrived in Boston I set myself to thinking how best I <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0122"/>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0123"/>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0124" n="99"/> could contrive to enjoy life and at
          the same time to increase my means. I possessed sufficient capital, and was able
          and ready to embark in whatever promised the best returns with the smallest
          personal risks. I settled myself in a suburb, paid off a few pressing claims,
          and began to reflect with my ordinary sagacity. </p>
        <p>We were now in the midst of a most absurd war with the South, and it was
          becoming difficult to escape the net of conscription. It might be wise to think
          of this in time. Europe seemed a desirable residence, but I needed more money to
          make this agreeable, and an investment for my brains was what I wanted most.
          Many schemes presented themselves as worthy the application of industry and
          talent, but none of them altogether suited my case. I thought at times of
          traveling as a physiological lecturer, combining with it the business of a
          practitioner: scare the audience at night with an enumeration of symptoms which
          belong to ten out of every dozen healthy people, and then doctor such of them as
          are gulls enough to consult me next day. The bigger the fright the better the
          pay. I was a little timid, however, about facing large audiences, as a man <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0125" n="100"/> will be naturally if he has lived a
          life of adventure, so that upon due consideration I gave up the idea altogether. </p>
        <p>The patent medicine business also looked well enough, but it is somewhat
          overdone at all times, and requires a heavy outlay, with the probable result of
          ill success. Indeed, I believe one hundred quack remedies fail for one that
          succeeds, and millions must have been wasted in placards, bills, and
          advertisements, which never returned half their value to the speculator. I think
          I shall some day beguile my time with writing an account of the principal quack
          remedies which have met with success. They are few in number, after all, as any
          one must know who recalls the countless pills and tonics which are puffed awhile
          on the fences, and disappear, to be heard of no more. </p>
        <p>Lastly, I inclined for a while to undertake a private insane asylum, which
          appeared to me to offer facilities for money-making, as to which, however, I may
          have been deceived by the writings of certain popular novelists. I went so far,
          I may say, as actually to visit Concord for the purpose of finding a pleasant
          locality and a suitable atmosphere. Upon reflection I abandoned my plans, as
          involving <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0126" n="101"/> too much personal labor to
          suit one of my easy frame of mind. </p>
        <p>Tired at last of idleness and lounging on the Common, I engaged in two or three
          little ventures of a semi-professional character, such as an exhibition of
          laughing-gas, advertising to cure cancer, &mdash; "Send twenty-five stamps
          by mail to J. B., and receive an infallible receipt,'' &mdash; etc. I did
          not find, however, that these little enterprises prospered well in New England,
          and I had recalled very forcibly a story which my father was fond of relating to
          me in my boyhood. It was about how certain very knowing flies went to get
          molasses, and how it ended by the molasses getting them. This, indeed, was
          precisely what happened to me in all my efforts to better myself in the Northern
          States, until at length my misfortunes climaxed in total and unexpected ruin. </p>
        <p>Having been very economical, I had now about twenty-seven hundred dollars. It
          was none too much. At this time I made the acquaintance of a sea-captain from
          Maine. He told me that he and two others had chartered a smart little steamer to
          run to Jamaica with a variety cargo. In fact, he meant to run into Wilmington or
          Charleston, and he <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0127" n="102"/> was to carry
          quinine, chloroform, and other medical requirements for the Confederates. He
          needed twenty-five hundred dollars more, and a doctor to buy the kind of things
          which army surgeons require. Of course I was prudent and he careful, but at
          last, on his proving to me that there was no risk, I agreed to expend his money,
          his friends', and my own up to twenty-five hundred dollars. I saw the other men,
          one of them a rebel captain. I was well pleased with the venture, and resolved
          for obvious reasons to go with them on the steamer. It was a promising
          investment, and I am free to reflect that in this, as in some other things, I
          have been free from vulgar prejudices. I bought all that we needed, and was well
          satisfied when it was cleverly stowed away in the hold. </p>
        <p>We were to sail on a certain Thursday morning in September, 1863. I sent my
          trunk to the vessel, and went down the evening before we were to start to go on
          board, but found that the little steamer had been hauled out from the pier. The
          captain, who met me at this time, endeavored to get a boat to ferry us to the
          ship; but a gale was blowing, and he advised me to wait until <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0128" n="103"/> morning. My associates were already on
          board. Early next day I dressed and went to the captain's room, which proved to
          be empty. I was instantly filled with doubt, and ran frantically to the Long
          Wharf, where, to my horror, I could see no signs of the vessel or captain.
          Neither have I ever set eyes on them from that time to this. I thought of
          lodging information with the police as to the unpatriotic design of the rascal
          who swindled me, but on the whole concluded that it was best to hold my tongue. </p>
        <p>It was, as I perceived, such utterly spilt milk as to be little worth
          lamenting, and I therefore set to work, with my accustomed energy, to utilize on
          my own behalf the resources of my medical education, which so often before had
          saved me from want. The war, then raging at its height, appeared to offer
          numerous opportunities to men of talent. The path which I chose was apparently a
          humble one, but it enabled me to make very practical use of my professional
          knowledge, and afforded for a time rapid and secure returns, without any other
          investment than a little knowledge cautiously employed. In the first place, I
          deposited my small remnant of property in a safe bank. Then I went to <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0129" n="104"/> Providence, where, as I had heard,
          patriotic persons were giving very large bounties in order, I suppose, to insure
          the government the services of better men than themselves. On my arrival I lost
          no time in offering myself as a substitute, and was readily accepted, and very
          soon mustered into the Twentieth Rhode Island. Three months were passed in camp,
          during which period I received bounty to the extent of six hundred and fifty
          dollars, with which I tranquilly deserted about two hours before the regiment
          left for the field. With the product of my industry I returned to Boston, and
          deposited all but enough to carry me to New York, where within a month I
          enlisted twice, earning on each occasion four hundred dollars. </p>
        <p>After this I thought it wise to try the same game in some of the smaller towns
          near to Philadelphia. I approached my birthplace with a good deal of doubt; but
          I selected a regiment in camp at Norristown, which is eighteen miles away. Here
          I got nearly seven hundred dollars by entering the service as a substitute for
          an editor, whose pen, I presume, was mightier than his sword. I was, however,
          disagreeably surprised by being hastily forwarded to the front under a foxy <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0130" n="105"/> young lieutenant, who brutally shot
          down a poor devil in the streets of Baltimore for attempting to desert. At this
          point I began to make use of my medical skill, for I did not in the least degree
          fancy being shot, either because of deserting or of not deserting. It happened,
          therefore, that a day or two later, while in Washington, I was seized in the
          street with a fit, which perfectly imposed upon the officer in charge, and
          caused him to leave me at the Douglas Hospital. Here I found it necessary to
          perform fits about twice a week, and as there were several real epileptics in
          the ward, I had a capital chance of studying their symptoms, which, finally, I
          learned to imitate with the utmost cleverness. </p>
        <p>I soon got to know three or four men who, like myself, were personally averse
          to bullets, and who were simulating other forms of disease with more or less
          success. One of them suffered with rheumatism of the back, and walked about like
          an old man; another, who had been to the front, was palsied in the right arm. A
          third kept open an ulcer on the leg, rubbing in a little antimonial ointment,
          which I bought at fifty cents, and sold him at five dollars a box. ] <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0131" n="106"/>
        </p>
        <p>A change in the hospital staff brought all of us to grief. The new surgeon was
          a quiet, gentlemanly person, with pleasant blue eyes and clearly cut features,
          and a way of looking at you without saying much. I felt so safe myself that I
          watched his procedures with just that kind of enjoyment which one clever man
          takes in seeing another at work. </p>
        <p>The first inspection settled two of us. </p>
        <p>"Another back case,'' said the assistant surgeon to his senior. </p>
        <p>"Back hurt you?'' says the latter, mildly. </p>
        <p>"Yes, sir; run over by a howitzer; ain't never been able to stand straight
          since.'' </p>
        <p>"A howitzer!'' says the surgeon. "Lean forward, my man, so as to touch the
          floor &mdash; so. That will do.'' Then turning to his aid, he said, "Prepare
          this man's discharge papers.'' </p>
        <p>"His discharge, sir?'' </p>
        <p>"Yes; I said that. Who+'s next?'' </p>
        <p>"Thank you, sir,'' groaned the man with the back. "How soon, sir, do you think
          it will be?'' </p>
        <p>"Ah, not less than a month,'' replied the surgeon, and passed on. </p>
        <p>Now, as it was unpleasant to be bent like the letter C, and as the patient
          presumed that <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0132" n="107"/> his discharge was
          secure, he naturally allowed himself a little relaxation in the way of becoming
          straighter. Unluckily, those nice blue eyes were everywhere at all hours, and
          one fine morning Smithson was appalled at finding himself in a detachment bound
          for the field, and bearing on his descriptive list an ill-natured indorsement
          about his malady. </p>
        <p>The surgeon came next on O'Callahan, standing, like each of us, at the foot of
          his own bed. </p>
        <p>"I+'ve paralytics in my arm,'' he said, with intention to explain his failure
          to salute his superior. </p>
        <p>"Humph!'' said the surgeon; "you have another hand.'' </p>
        <p>"An' it+'s not the rigulation to saloot with yer left,'' said the Irishman,
          with a grin, while the patients around us began to smile. </p>
        <p>"How did it happen?'' said the surgeon. </p>
        <p>"I was shot in the shoulder,'' answered the patient, "about three months ago,
          sir. I have+n't stirred it since.'' </p>
        <p>The surgeon looked at the scar. </p>
        <p>"So recently?'' said he. "The scar looks older; and, by the way, doctor,''
          &mdash; to his junior, &mdash; "it could not have gone near the nerves.
          Bring the battery, orderly.'' <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0133" n="108"/>
        </p>
        <p>In a few moments the surgeon was testing one after another, the various
          muscles. At last he stopped. "Send this man away with the next detachment. Not a
          word, my man. You are a rascal, and a disgrace to honest men who have been among
          bullets.'' </p>
        <p>The man muttered something, I did not hear what. </p>
        <p>"Put this man in the guard-house,'' cried the surgeon, and so passed on without
          smile or frown. </p>
        <p>As to the ulcer case, to my amusement he was put in bed, and his leg locked up
          in a wooden splint, which effectually prevented him from touching the part
          diseased. It healed in ten days, and he too went as food for powder. </p>
        <p>The surgeon asked me a few questions, and requesting to be sent for during my
          next fit, left me alone. </p>
        <p>I was, of course, on my guard, and took care to have my attacks only during his
          absence, or to have them over before he arrived. At length, one morning, in
          spite of my care, he chanced to enter the ward as I fell on the floor. I was
          laid on the bed, apparently in strong convulsions. Presently I felt a finger on
          my eyelid, and as it was raised, saw the <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0134"
            n="109"/> surgeon standing beside me. To escape his scrutiny I became more
          violent in my motions. He stopped a moment and looked at me steadily. "Poor
          fellow!'' said he, to my great relief, as I felt at once that I had successfully
          deceived him. Then he turned to the ward doctor and remarked: "Take care he does
          not hurt his head against the bed; and, by the by, doctor, do you remember the
          test we applied in Carstairs's case? Just tickle the soles of his feet and see
          if it will cause those backward spasms of the head.'' </p>
        <p>The aid obeyed him, and, very naturally, I jerked my head backward as hard as I
          could. </p>
        <p>"That will answer,'' said the surgeon, to my horror. "A clever rogue. Send him
          to the guard-house.'' </p>
        <p>Happy had I been had my ill luck ended here, but as I crossed the yard an
          officer stopped me. To my disgust, it was the captain of my old Rhode Island
          company. </p>
        <p>"Hello!'' said he; "keep that fellow safe. I know him.'' </p>
        <p>To cut short a long story, I was tried, convicted, and forced to refund the
          Rhode Island bounty, for by ill luck they found my bank-book among my papers. I
          was finally sent <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0135" n="110"/> to Fort Delaware and
          kept at hard labor, handling and carrying shot, policing the ground, picking up
          cigar-stumps, and other light, unpleasant occupations. </p>
        <p>When the war was over I was released. I went at once to Boston, where I had
          about four hundred dollars in bank. I spent nearly all of this sum before I
          could satisfy the accumulated cravings of a year and a half without drink or
          tobacco, or a decent meal. I was about to engage in a little business as a
          vender of lottery policies when I first began to feel a strange sense of
          lassitude, which soon increased so as quite to disable me from work of any kind.
          Month after month passed away, while my money lessened, and this terrible sense
          of weariness went on from bad to worse. At last one day, after nearly a year had
          elapsed, I perceived on my face a large brown patch of color, in consequence of
          which I went in some alarm to consult a well-known physician. He asked me a
          multitude of tiresome questions, and at last wrote off a prescription, which I
          immediately read. It was a preparation of arsenic. </p>
        <p>"What do you think,'' said I, "is the matter with me, doctor?'' </p>
        <p>"I am afraid,'' said he, "that you have a <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0136"
            n="111"/> very serious trouble &mdash; what we call Addison's disease.'' </p>
        <p>"What+'s that?'' said I. </p>
        <p>"I do not think you would comprehend it,'' he replied; "it is an affection of
          the suprarenal capsules.'' </p>
        <p>I dimly remembered that there were such organs, and that nobody knew what they
          were meant for. It seemed that doctors had found a use for them at last. </p>
        <p>"Is it a dangerous disease?'' I said. </p>
        <p>"I fear so,'' he answered. </p>
        <p>"Don't you really know,'' I asked, "what+'s the truth about it?'' </p>
        <p>"Well,'' he returned gravely, "I+'m sorry to tell you it is a very dangerous
          malady.'' </p>
        <p>"Nonsense!'' said I; "I don't believe it''; for I thought it was only a
          doctor's trick, and one I had tried often enough myself. </p>
        <p>"Thank you,'' said he; "you are a very ill man, and a fool besides. Good
          morning.'' He forgot to ask for a fee, and I did not therefore find it necessary
          to escape payment by telling him I was a doctor. </p>
        <p>Several weeks went by; my money was gone, my clothes were ragged, and, like my
          body, nearly worn out, and now I am an inmate of a hospital. To-day I feel
          weaker <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0137" n="112"/> than when I first began to
          write. How it will end, I do not know. If I die, the doctor will get this
          pleasant history, and if I live, I shall burn it, and as soon as I get a little
          money I will set out to look for my sister. I dreamed about her last night. What
          I dreamed was not very agreeable. I thought it was night. I was walking up one
          of the vilest streets near my old office, and a girl spoke to me &mdash; a
          shameless, worn creature, with great sad eyes. Suddenly she screamed, "Brother,
          brother!'' and then remembering what she had been, with her round, girlish,
          innocent face and fair hair, and seeing what she was now, I awoke and saw the
          dim light of the half-darkened ward. </p>
        <p>I am better to-day. Writing all this stuff has amused me and, I think, done me
          good. That was a horrid dream I had. I suppose I must tear up all this
          biography. </p>
        <p>"Hello, nurse! The little boy &mdash; boy &mdash; '' </p>
        <p>"GOOD HEAVENS!'' said the nurse, "he is dead! Dr. Alston said it would happen
          this way. The screen, quick &mdash; the screen &mdash; and let the
          doctor know.''</p>

        <head> THE CASE OF GEORGE DEDLOW</head>

        <p>THE following notes of my own case have been declined on various pretests by
          every medical journal to which I have offered them. There was, perhaps, some
          reason in this, because many of the medical facts which they record are not
          altogether new, and because the psychical deductions to which they have led me
          are not in themselves of medical interest. I ought to add that a great deal of
          what is here related is not of any scientific value whatsoever; but as one or
          two people on whose judgment I rely have advised me to print my narrative with
          all the personal details, rather than in the dry shape in which, as a
          psychological statement, I shall publish it elsewhere, I have yielded to their
          views. I <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0141" n="116"/> suspect, however, that the
          very character of my record will, in the eyes of some of my readers, tend to
          lessen the value of the metaphysical discoveries which it sets forth. </p>
        <p>I AM the son of a physician, still in large practice, in the village of
          Abington, Scofield County, Indiana. Expecting to act as his future partner, I
          studied medicine in his office, and in 1859 and 1860 attended lectures at the
          Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. My second course should have been in
          the following year, but the outbreak of the Rebellion so crippled my father's
          means that I was forced to abandon my intention. The demand for army surgeons at
          this time became very great; and although not a graduate, I found no difficulty
          in getting the place of assistant surgeon to the Tenth Indiana Volunteers. In
          the subsequent Western campaigns this organization suffered so severely that
          before the term of its service was over it was merged in the Twenty-first
          Indiana Volunteers; and I, as an extra surgeon, ranked by the medical officers
          of the latter regiment, was transferred to the Fifteenth Indiana Cavalry. Like
          many physicians, I had contracted a strong taste for army life, <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0142" n="117"/> and, disliking cavalry service, sought
          and obtained the position of first lieutenant in the Seventy-ninth Indiana
          Volunteers, an infantry regiment of excellent character. </p>
        <p>On the day after I assumed command of my company, which had no captain, we were
          sent to garrison a part of a line of block-houses stretching along the
          Cumberland River below Nashville, then occupied by a portion of the command of
          General Rosecrans. </p>
        <p>The life we led while on this duty was tedious and at the same time dangerous
          in the extreme. Food was scarce and bad, the water horrible, and we had no
          cavalry to forage for us. If, as infantry, we attempted to levy supplies upon
          the scattered farms around us, the population seemed suddenly to double, and in
          the shape of guerrillas "potted'' us industriously from behind distant trees,
          rocks, or fences. Under these various and unpleasant influences, combined with a
          fair infusion of malaria, our men rapidly lost health and spirits.
          Unfortunately, no proper medical supplies had been forwarded with our small
          force (two companies), and, as the fall advanced, the want of quinine and
          stimulants became a serious <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0143" n="118"/>
          annoyance. Moreover, our rations were running low; we had been three weeks
          without a new supply; and our commanding officer, Major Henry L. Terrill, began
          to be uneasy as to the safety of his men. About this time it was supposed that a
          train with rations would be due from the post twenty miles to the north of us;
          yet it was quite possible that it would bring us food, but no medicines, which
          were what we most needed. The command was too small to detach any part of it,
          and the major therefore resolved to send an officer alone to the post above us,
          where the rest of the Seventy-ninth lay, and whence they could easily forward
          quinine and stimulants by the train, if it had not left, or, if it had, by a
          small cavalry escort. </p>
        <p>It so happened, to my cost, as it turned out, that I was the only officer fit
          to make the journey, and I was accordingly ordered to proceed to Blockhouse No.
          3 and make the required arrangements. I started alone just after dusk the next
          night, and during the darkness succeeded in getting within three miles of my
          destination. At this time I found that I had lost my way, and, although aware of
          the danger of my act, was forced to turn aside and ask at a log cabin for <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0144" n="119"/> directions. The house contained a
          dried-up old woman and four white-headed, half-naked children. The woman was
          either stone-deaf or pretended to be so; but, at all events, she gave me no
          satisfaction, and I remounted and rode away. On coming to the end of a lane,
          into which I had turned to seek the cabin, I found to my surprise that the bars
          had been put up during my brief parley. They were too high to leap, and I
          therefore dismounted to pull them down. As I touched the top rail, I heard a
          rifle, and at the same instant felt a blow on both arms, which fell helpless. I
          staggered to my horse and tried to mount; but, as I could use neither arm, the
          effort was vain, and I therefore stood still, awaiting my fate. I am only
          conscious that I saw about me several graybacks, for I must have fallen fainting
          almost immediately. </p>
        <p>When I awoke I was lying in the cabin near by, upon a pile of rubbish. Ten or
          twelve guerrillas were gathered about the fire, apparently drawing lots for my
          watch, boots, hat, etc. I now made an effort to find out how far I was hurt. I
          discovered that I could use the left forearm and hand pretty well, and with this
          hand I felt the right limb all over until I touched the wound. The ball <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0145" n="120"/> had passed from left to right through
          the left biceps, and directly through the right arm just below the shoulder,
          emerging behind. The right arm and forearm were cold and perfectly insensible. I
          pinched them as well as I could, to test the amount of sensation remaining; but
          the hand might as well have been that of a dead man. I began to understand that
          the nerves had been wounded, and that the part was utterly powerless. By this
          time my friends had pretty well divided the spoils, and, rising together, went
          out. The old woman then came to me, and said: "Reckon you+'d best git up.
          They-'uns is a-goin' to take you away.'' To this I only answered, "Water,
          water.'' I had a grim sense of amusement on finding that the old woman was not
          deaf, for she went out, and presently came back with a gourdful, which I eagerly
          drank. An hour later the graybacks returned, and finding that I was too weak to
          walk, carried me out and laid me on the bottom of a common cart, with which they
          set off on a trot. The jolting was horrible, but within an hour I began to have
          in my dead right hand a strange burning, which was rather a relief to me. It
          increased as the sun rose and the day grew warm, until I felt <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0146" n="121"/> as if the hand was caught and pinched
          in a red-hot vise. Then in my agony I begged my guard for water to wet it with,
          but for some reason they desired silence, and at every noise threatened me with
          a revolver. At length the pain became absolutely unendurable, and I grew what it
          is the fashion to call demoralized. I screamed, cried, and yelled in my torture,
          until, as I suppose, my captors became alarmed, and, stopping, gave me a
          handkerchief, &mdash; my own, I fancy, &mdash; and a canteen of water,
          with which I wetted the hand, to my unspeakable relief. </p>
        <p>It is unnecessary to detail the events by which, finally, I found myself in one
          of the rebel hospitals near Atlanta. Here, for the first time, my wounds were
          properly cleansed and dressed by a Dr. Oliver T. Wilson, who treated me
          throughout with great kindness. I told him I had been a doctor, which, perhaps,
          may have been in part the cause of the unusual tenderness with which I was
          managed. The left arm was now quite easy, although, as will be seen, it never
          entirely healed. The right arm was worse than ever &mdash; the humerus
          broken, the nerves wounded, and the hand alive only to pain. I use this phrase
          because it is connected in my mind <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0147" n="122"/>
          with a visit from a local visitor, &mdash; I am not sure he was a preacher,
          &mdash; who used to go daily through the wards, and talk to us or write our
          letters. One morning he stopped at my bed, when this little talk occurred: </p>
        <p>"How are you, lieutenant?'' </p>
        <p>"Oh,'' said I, "as usual. All right, but this hand, which is dead except to
          pain.'' </p>
        <p>"Ah,'' said he, "such and thus will the wicked be &mdash; such will you be
          if you die in your sins: you will go where only pain can be felt. For all
          eternity, all of you will be just like that hand &mdash; knowing pain
          only.'' </p>
        <p>I suppose I was very weak, but somehow I felt a sudden and chilling horror of
          possible universal pain, and suddenly fainted. When I awoke the hand was worse,
          if that could be. It was red, shining, aching, burning, and, as it seemed to me,
          perpetually rasped with hot files. When the doctor came I begged for morphia. He
          said gravely: "We have none. You know you don't allow it to pass the lines.'' It
          was sadly true. </p>
        <p>I turned to the wall, and wetted the hand again, my sole relief. In about an
          hour Dr. Wilson came back with two aids, and explained to me that the bone was
          so crushed as to make it hopeless to save it, and that, <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0148" n="123"/> besides, amputation offered some chance
          of arresting the pain. I had thought of this before, but the anguish I felt
          &mdash; I cannot say endured &mdash; was so awful that I made no more of
          losing the limb than of parting with a tooth on account of toothache.
          Accordingly, brief preparations were made, which I watched with a sort of
          eagerness such as must forever be inexplicable to any one who has not passed six
          weeks of torture like that which I had suffered. </p>
        <p>I had but one pang before the operation. As I arranged myself on the left side,
          so as to make it convenient for the operator to use the knife, I asked: "Who is
          to give me the ether?'' "We have none,'' said the person questioned. I set my
          teeth, and said no more. </p>
        <p>I need not describe the operation. The pain felt was severe, but it was
          insignificant as compared with that of any other minute of the past six weeks.
          The limb was removed very near to the shoulder-joint. As the second incision was
          made, I felt a strange flash of pain play through the limb, as if it were in
          every minutest fibril of nerve. This was followed by instant, unspeakable
          relief, and before the flaps were brought together I was <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0149" n="124"/> sound asleep. I dimly remember saying,
          as I pointed to the arm which lay on the floor: "There is the pain, and here am
          I. How queer!'' Then I slept &mdash; slept the sleep of the just, or,
          better, of the painless. From this time forward I was free from neuralgia. At a
          subsequent period I saw a number of cases similar to mine in a hospital in
          Philadelphia. </p>
        <p>It is no part of my plan to detail my weary months of monotonous prison life in
          the South. In the early part of April, 1863, I was exchanged, and after the
          usual thirty days' furlough returned to my regiment a captain. </p>
        <p>On the 19th of September, 1863, occurred the battle of Chickamauga, in which my
          regiment took a conspicuous part. The close of our own share in this contest is,
          as it were, burned into my memory with every least detail. It was about 6 P. M.,
          when we found ourselves in line, under cover of a long, thin row of scrubby
          trees, beyond which lay a gentle slope, from which, again, rose a hill rather
          more abrupt, and crowned with an earthwork. We received orders to cross this
          space and take the fort in front, while a brigade on our right was to make a
          like movement on its flank. <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0150" n="125"/>
        </p>
        <p>Just before we emerged into the open ground, we noticed what, I think, was
          common in many fights &mdash; that the enemy had begun to bowl round shot at
          us, probably from failure of shell. We passed across the valley in good order,
          although the men fell rapidly all along the line. As we climbed the hill, our
          pace slackened, and the fire grew heavier. At this moment a battery opened on
          our left, the shots crossing our heads obliquely. It is this moment which is so
          printed on my recollection. I can see now, as if through a window, the gray
          smoke, lit with red flashes, the long, wavering line, the sky blue above, the
          trodden furrows, blotted with blue blouses. Then it was as if the window closed,
          and I knew and saw no more. No other scene in my life is thus scarred, if I may
          say so, into my memory. I have a fancy that the horrible shock which suddenly
          fell upon me must have had something to do with thus intensifying the momentary
          image then before my eyes. </p>
        <p>When I awakened, I was lying under a tree somewhere at the rear. The ground was
          covered with wounded, and the doctors were busy at an operating-table,
          improvised from two barrels and a plank. At length two of <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0151" n="126"/> them who were examining the wounded
          about me came up to where I lay. A hospital steward raised my head and poured
          down some brandy and water, while another cut loose my pantaloons. The doctors
          exchanged looks and walked away. I asked the steward where I was hit. </p>
        <p>"Both thighs,'' said he; "the doctors won't do nothing.'' </p>
        <p>"No use?'' said I. </p>
        <p>"Not much,'' said he. </p>
        <p>"Not much means none at all,'' I answered. </p>
        <p>When he had gone I set myself to thinking about a good many things I had better
          have thought of before, but which in no way concern the history of my case. A
          half-hour went by. I had no pain, and did not get weaker. At last, I cannot
          explain why, I began to look about me. At first things appeared a little hazy. I
          remember one thing which thrilled me a little, even then. </p>
        <p>A tall, blond-bearded major walked up to a doctor near me, saying, "When
          you+'ve a little leisure, just take a look at my side.'' </p>
        <p>"Do it now,'' said the doctor. </p>
        <p>The officer exposed his wound. "Ball went in here, and out there.'' </p>
        <p>The doctor looked up at him &mdash; half pity, <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0152" n="127"/> half amazement. "If you+'ve got any
          message, you+'d best send it by me.'' </p>
        <p>"Why, you don't say it+'s serious?'' was the reply. </p>
        <p>"Serious! Why, you+'re shot through the stomach. You won't live over the day.'' </p>
        <p>Then the man did what struck me as a very odd thing. He said, "Anybody got a
          pipe?'' Some one gave him a pipe. He filled it deliberately, struck a light with
          a flint, and sat down against a tree near to me. Presently the doctor came to
          him again, and asked him what he could do for him. </p>
        <p>"Send me a drink of Bourbon.'' </p>
        <p>"Anything else?'' </p>
        <p>"No.'' </p>
        <p>As the doctor left him, he called him back. "It+'s a little rough, doc, is+n't
          it?'' </p>
        <p>No more passed, and I saw this man no longer. Another set of doctors were
          handling my legs, for the first time causing pain. A moment after a steward put
          a towel over my mouth, and I smelled the familiar odor of chloroform, which I
          was glad enough to breathe. In a moment the trees began to move around from left
          to right, faster and faster; then a universal grayness came before me,
          &mdash; and I recall nothing further until <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0153"
            n="128"/> I awoke to consciousness in a hospital-tent. I got hold of my own
          identity in a moment or two, and was suddenly aware of a sharp cramp in my left
          leg. I tried to get at it to rub it with my single arm, but, finding myself too
          weak, hailed an attendant. "Just rub my left calf,'' said I, "if you please.'' </p>
        <p>"Calf?'' said he. "You ain't none. It+'s took off.'' </p>
        <p>"I know better,'' said I. "I have pain in both legs.'' </p>
        <p>"Wall, I never!'' said he. "You ain't got nary leg.'' </p>
        <p>As I did not believe him, he threw off the covers, and, to my horror, showed me
          that I had suffered amputation of both thighs, very high up. </p>
        <p>"That will do,'' said I, faintly. </p>
        <p>A month later, to the amazement of every one, I was so well as to be moved from
          the crowded hospital at Chattanooga to Nashville, where I filled one of the ten
          thousand beds of that vast metropolis of hospitals. Of the sufferings which then
          began I shall presently speak. It will be best just now to detail the final
          misfortune which here fell upon me. Hospital No. 2, in which I lay, was
          inconveniently crowded with severely wounded <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0154"
            n="129"/> officers. After my third week an epidemic of hospital gangrene broke
          out in my ward. In three days it attacked twenty persons. Then an inspector
          came, and we were transferred at once to the open air, and placed in tents.
          Strangely enough, the wound in my remaining arm, which still suppurated, was
          seized with gangrene. The usual remedy, bromine, was used locally, but the main
          artery opened, was tied, bled again and again, and at last, as a final resort,
          the remaining arm was amputated at the shoulder-joint. Against all chances I
          recovered, to find myself a useless torso, more like some strange larval
          creature than anything of human shape. Of my anguish and horror of myself I dare
          not speak. I have dictated these pages, not to shock my readers, but to possess
          them with facts in regard to the relation of the mind to the body; and I hasten,
          therefore, to such portions of my case as best illustrate these views. </p>
        <p>In January, 1864, I was forwarded to Philadelphia, in order to enter what was
          known as the Stump Hospital, South street, then in charge of Dr. Hopkinson. This
          favor was obtained through the influence of my father's friend, the late
          Governor Anderson, who has <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0155" n="130"/> always
          manifested an interest in my case, for which I am deeply grateful. It was
          thought, at the time, that Mr. Palmer, the leg-maker, might be able to adapt
          some form of arm to my left shoulder, as on that side there remained five inches
          of the arm-bone, which I could move to a moderate extent. The hope proved
          illusory, as the stump was always too tender to bear any pressure. The hospital
          referred to was in charge of several surgeons while I was an inmate, and was at
          all times a clean and pleasant home. It was filled with men who had lost one arm
          or leg, or one of each, as happened now and then. I saw one man who had lost
          both legs, and one who had parted with both arms; but none, like myself,
          stripped of every limb. There were collected in this place hundreds of these
          cases, which gave to it, with reason enough, the not very pleasing title of
          Stump Hospital. </p>
        <p>I spent here three and a half months, before my transfer to the United States
          Army Hospital for Injuries and Diseases of the Nervous System. Every morning I
          was carried out in an arm-chair and placed in the library, where some one was
          always ready to write or read for me, or to fill my pipe. The doctors lent me
          medical books; the ladies brought me <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0156" n="131"/>
          luxuries and fed me; and, save that I was helpless to a degree which was
          humiliating, I was as comfortable as kindness could make me. </p>
        <p>I amused myself at this time by noting in my mind all that I could learn from
          other limbless folk, and from myself, as to the peculiar feelings which were
          noticed in regard to lost members. I found that the great mass of men who had
          undergone amputations for many months felt the usual consciousness that they
          still had the lost limb. It itched or pained, or was cramped, but never felt hot
          or cold. If they had painful sensations referred to it, the conviction of its
          existence continued unaltered for long periods; but where no pain was felt in
          it, then by degrees the sense of having that limb faded away entirely. I think
          we may to some extent explain this. The knowledge we possess of any part is made
          up of the numberless impressions from without which affect its sensitive
          surfaces, and which are transmitted through its nerves to the spinal
          nerve-cells, and through them, again, to the brain. We are thus kept endlessly
          informed as to the existence of parts, because the impressions which reach the
          brain are, by a law of our being, referred by us to the part from <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0157" n="132"/> which they come. Now, when the part is
          cut off, the nerve-trunks which led to it and from it, remaining capable of
          being impressed by irritations, are made to convey to the brain from the stump
          impressions which are, as usual, referred by the brain to the lost parts to
          which these nerve-threads belonged. In other words, the nerve is like a
          bell-wire. You may pull it at any part of its course, and thus ring the bell as
          well as if you pulled at the end of the wire; but, in any case, the intelligent
          servant will refer the pull to the front door, and obey it accordingly. The
          impressions made on the severed ends of the nerve are due often to changes in
          the stump during healing, and consequently cease when it has healed, so that
          finally, in a very healthy stump, no such impressions arise; the brain ceases to
          correspond with the lost leg, and, as <hi rend="italic">les absents ont toujours
            tort</hi>, it is no longer remembered or recognized. But in some cases, such
          as mine proved at last to my sorrow, the ends of the nerves undergo a curious
          alteration, and get to be enlarged and altered. This change, as I have seen in
          my practice of medicine, sometimes passes up the nerves toward the centers, and
          occasions a more or less constant irritation of the nerve- <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0158" n="133"/> fibers, producing neuralgia, which is
          usually referred by the brain to that part of the lost limb to which the
          affected nerve belonged. This pain keeps the brain ever mindful of the missing
          part, and, imperfectly at least, preserves to the man a consciousness of
          possessing that which he has not. </p>
        <p>Where the pains come and go, as they do in certain cases, the subjective
          sensations thus occasioned are very curious, since in such cases the man loses
          and gains, and loses and regains, the consciousness of the presence of the lost
          parts, so that he will tell you, "Now I feel my thumb, now I feel my little
          finger.'' I should also add that nearly every person who has lost an arm above
          the elbow feels as though the lost member were bent at the elbow, and at times
          is vividly impressed with the notion that his fingers are strongly flexed. </p>
        <p>Other persons present a peculiarity which I am at a loss to account for. Where
          the leg, for instance, has been lost, they feel as if the foot were present, but
          as though the leg were shortened. Thus, if the thigh has been taken off, there
          seems to them to be a foot at the knee; if the arm, a hand seems to be at the
          elbow, or attached to the stump itself. <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0159" n="134"
          />
        </p>
        <p>Before leaving Nashville I had begun to suffer the most acute pain in my left
          hand, especially the little finger; and so perfect was the idea which was thus
          kept up of the real presence of these missing parts that I found it hard at
          times to believe them absent. Often at night I would try with one lost hand to
          grope for the other. As, however, I had no pain in the right arm, the sense of
          the existence of that limb gradually disappeared, as did that of my legs also. </p>
        <p>Everything was done for my neuralgia which the doctors could think of; and at
          length, at my suggestion, I was removed, as I have said, from the Stump Hospital
          to the United States Army Hospital for Injuries and Diseases of the Nervous
          System. It was a pleasant, suburban, old-fashioned country-seat, its gardens
          surrounded by a circle of wooden, one-story wards, shaded by fine trees. There
          were some three hundred cases of epilepsy, paralysis, St. Vitus's dance, and
          wounds of nerves. On one side of me lay a poor fellow, a Dane, who had the same
          burning neuralgia with which I once suffered, and which I now learned was only
          too common. This man had become hysterical from pain. He carried a sponge in his
          pocket, and a bottle of <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0160" n="135"/> water in one
          hand, with which he constantly wetted the burning hand. Every sound increased
          his torture, and he even poured water into his boots to keep himself from
          feeling too sensibly the rough friction of his soles when walking. Like him, I
          was greatly eased by having small doses of morphia injected under the skin of my
          shoulder with a hollow needle fitted to a syringe. </p>
        <p>As I improved under the morphia treatment, I began to be disturbed by the
          horrible variety of suffering about me. One man walked sideways; there was one
          who could not smell; another was dumb from an explosion. In fact, every one had
          his own abnormal peculiarity. Near me was a strange case of palsy of the muscles
          called rhomboids, whose office it is to hold down the shoulder-blades flat on
          the back during the motions of the arms, which, in themselves, were strong
          enough. When, however, he lifted these members, the shoulder-blades stood out
          from the back like wings, and got him the sobriquet of the "Angel.'' In my ward
          were also the cases of fits, which very much annoyed me, as upon any great
          change in the weather it was common to have a dozen convulsions in view at once.
          Dr. Neek, <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0161" n="136"/> one of our physicians, told
          me that on one occasion a hundred and fifty fits took place within thirty-six
          hours. On my complaining of these sights, whence I alone could not fly, I was
          placed in the paralytic and wound ward, which I found much more pleasant. </p>
        <p>A month of skilful treatment eased me entirely of my aches, and I then began to
          experience certain curious feelings, upon which, having nothing to do and
          nothing to do anything with, I reflected a good deal. It was a good while before
          I could correctly explain to my own satisfaction the phenomena which at this
          time I was called upon to observe. By the various operations already described I
          had lost about four fifths of my weight. As a consequence of this I ate much
          less than usual, and could scarcely have consumed the ration of a soldier. I
          slept also but little; for, as sleep is the repose of the brain, made necessary
          by the waste of its tissues during thought and voluntary movement, and as this
          latter did not exist in my case, I needed only that rest which was necessary to
          repair such exhaustion of the nerve-centers as was induced by thinking and the
          automatic movements of the viscera. </p>
        <p>I observed at this time also that my heart, <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0162"
            n="137"/> in place of beating, as it once did, seventy-eight in the minute,
          pulsated only forty-five times in this interval &mdash; a fact to be easily
          explained by the perfect quiescence to which I was reduced, and the consequent
          absence of that healthy and constant stimulus to the muscles of the heart which
          exercise occasions. </p>
        <p>Notwithstanding these drawbacks, my physical health was good, which, I confess,
          surprised me, for this among other reasons: It is said that a burn of two thirds
          of the surface destroys life, because then all the excretory matters which this
          portion of the glands of the skin evolved are thrown upon the blood, and poison
          the man, just as happens in an animal whose skin the physiologist has varnished,
          so as in this way to destroy its function. Yet here was I, having lost at least
          a third of my skin, and apparently none the worse for it. </p>
        <p>Still more remarkable, however, were the psychical changes which I now began to
          perceive. I found to my horror that at times I was less conscious of myself, of
          my own existence, than used to be the case. This sensation was so novel that at
          first it quite bewildered me. I felt like asking some one <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0163" n="138"/> constantly if I were really George
          Dedlow or not; but, well aware how absurd I should seem after such a question, I
          refrained from speaking of my case, and strove more keenly to analyze my
          feelings. At times the conviction of my want of being myself was overwhelming
          and most painful. It was, as well as I can describe it, a deficiency in the
          egoistic sentiment of individuality. About one half of the sensitive surface of
          my skin was gone, and thus much of relation to the outer world destroyed. As a
          consequence, a large part of the receptive central organs must be out of employ,
          and, like other idle things, degenerating rapidly. Moreover, all the great
          central ganglia, which give rise to movements in the limbs, were also eternally
          at rest. Thus one half of me was absent or functionally dead. This set me to
          thinking how much a man might lose and yet live. If I were unhappy enough to
          survive, I might part with my spleen at least, as many a dog has done, and grown
          fat afterwards. The other organs with which we breathe and circulate the blood
          would be essential; so also would the liver; but at least half of the intestines
          might be dispensed with, and of course all of the limbs. And as to the nervous
          system, the only parts <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0164" n="139"/> really
          necessary to life are a few small ganglia. Were the rest absent or inactive, we
          should have a man reduced, as it were, to the lowest terms, and leading an
          almost vegetative existence. Would such a being, I asked myself, possess the
          sense of individuality in its usual completeness, even if his organs of
          sensation remained, and he were capable of consciousness? Of course, without
          them, he could not have it any more than a dahlia or a tulip. But with them
          &mdash; how then? I concluded that it would be at a minimum, and that, if
          utter loss of relation to the outer world were capable of destroying a man's
          consciousness of himself, the destruction of half of his sensitive surfaces
          might well occasion, in a less degree, a like result, and so diminish his sense
          of individual existence. </p>
        <p>I thus reached the conclusion that a man is not his brain, or any one part of
          it, but all of his economy, and that to lose any part must lessen this sense of
          his own existence. I found but one person who properly appreciated this great
          truth. She was a New England lady, from Hartford &mdash; an agent, I think,
          for some commission, perhaps the Sanitary. After I had told her my views and
          feelings she said: "Yes, I comprehend. The <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0165"
            n="140"/> fractional entities of vitality are embraced in the oneness of the
          unitary Ego. Life,'' she added, "is the garnered condensation of objective
          impressions; and as the objective is the remote father of the subjective, so
          must individuality, which is but focused subjectivity, suffer and fade when the
          sensation lenses, by which the rays of impression are condensed, become
          destroyed.'' I am not quite clear that I fully understood her, but I think she
          appreciated my ideas, and I felt grateful for her kindly interest. </p>
        <p>The strange want I have spoken of now haunted and perplexed me so constantly
          that I became moody and wretched. While in this state, a man from a neighboring
          ward fell one morning into conversation with the chaplain, within ear-shot of my
          chair. Some of their words arrested my attention, and I turned my head to see
          and listen. The speaker, who wore a sergeant's chevron and carried one arm in a
          sling was a tall, loosely made person, with a pale face, light eyes of a
          washed-out blue tint, and very sparse yellow whiskers. His mouth was weak, both
          lips being almost alike, so that the organ might have been turned upside down
          without affecting its expression. His forehead, how- <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0166" n="141"/> ever, was high and thinly covered with
          sandy hair. I should have said, as a phrenologist, will feeble; emotional, but
          not passionate; likely to be an enthusiast or a weakly bigot. </p>
        <p>I caught enough of what passed to make me call to the sergeant when the
          chaplain left him. </p>
        <p>"Good morning,'' said he. "How do you get on?'' </p>
        <p>"Not at all,'' I replied. "Where were you hit?'' </p>
        <p>"Oh, at Chancellorsville. I was shot in the shoulder. I have what the doctors
          call paralysis of the median nerve, but I guess Dr. Neek and the lightnin'
          battery will fix it. When my time+'s out I+'ll go back to Kearsarge and try on
          the school-teaching again. I+'ve done my share.'' </p>
        <p>"Well,'' said I, "you+'re better off than I.'' </p>
        <p>"Yes,'' he answered, "in more ways than one. I belong to the New Church. It+'s
          a great comfort for a plain man like me, when he+'s weary and sick, to be able
          to turn away from earthly things and hold converse daily with the great and good
          who have left this here world. We have a circle in Coates street. If it wa'n't
          for the consoling I get there, I+'d of wished myself dead many a time. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0167" n="142"/> I ain't got kith or kin on earth; but
          this matters little, when one can just talk to them daily and know that they are
          in the spheres above us.'' </p>
        <p>"It must be a great comfort,'' I replied, "if only one could believe it.'' </p>
        <p>"Believe!'' he repeated. "How can you help it? Do you suppose anything dies?'' </p>
        <p>"No,'' I said. "The soul does not, I am sure; and as to matter, it merely
          changes form.'' </p>
        <p>"But why, then,'' said he, "should not the dead soul talk to the living? In
          space, no doubt, exist all forms of matter, merely in finer, more ethereal
          being. You can't suppose a naked soul moving about without a bodily garment
          &mdash; no creed teaches that; and if its new clothing be of like substance
          to ours, only of ethereal fineness, &mdash; a more delicate
          recrystallization about the eternal spiritual nucleus, &mdash; must it not
          then possess powers as much more delicate and refined as is the new material in
          which it is reclad?'' </p>
        <p>"Not very clear,'' I answered; "but, after all, the thing should be susceptible
          of some form of proof to our present senses.'' </p>
        <p>"And so it is,'' said he. "Come to-morrow with me, and you shall see and hear
          for yourself.'' <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0168" n="143"/>
        </p>
        <p>"I will,'' said I, "if the doctor will lend me the ambulance.'' </p>
        <p>It was so arranged, as the surgeon in charge was kind enough, as usual, to
          oblige me with the loan of his wagon, and two orderlies to lift my useless
          trunk. </p>
        <p>On the day following I found myself, with my new comrade, in a house in Coates
          street, where a "circle'' was in the daily habit of meeting. So soon as I had
          been comfortably deposited in an arm-chair, beside a large pine table, the rest
          of those assembled seated themselves, and for some time preserved an unbroken
          silence. During this pause I scrutinized the persons present. Next to me, on my
          right, sat a flabby man, with ill-marked, baggy features and injected eyes. He
          was, as I learned afterwards, an eclectic doctor, who had tried his hand at
          medicine and several of its quackish variations, finally settling down on
          eclecticism, which I believe professes to be to scientific medicine what
          vegetarianism is to common-sense, every-day dietetics. Next to him sat a
          female-authoress, I think, of two somewhat feeble novels, and much pleasanter to
          look at than her books. She was, I thought, a good deal excited at the prospect
          of spiritual revelations. Her neighbor was a <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0169"
            n="144"/> pallid, care-worn young woman, with very red lips, and large brown
          eyes of great beauty. She was, as I learned afterwards, a magnetic patient of
          the doctor, and had deserted her husband, a master mechanic, to follow this new
          light. The others were, like myself, strangers brought hither by mere curiosity.
          One of them was a lady in deep black, closely veiled. Beyond her, and opposite
          to me, sat the sergeant, and next to him the medium, a man named Brink. He wore
          a good deal of jewelry, and had large black side-whiskers &mdash; a
          shrewd-visaged, large-nosed, full-lipped man, formed by nature to appreciate the
          pleasant things of sensual existence. </p>
        <p>Before I had ended my survey, he turned to the lady in black, and asked if she
          wished to see any one in the spirit-world. </p>
        <p>She said, "Yes,'' rather feebly. </p>
        <p>"Is the spirit present?'' he asked. Upon which two knocks were heard in
          affirmation. "Ah!'' said the medium, "the name is &mdash; it is the name of
          a child. It is a male child. It is &mdash; '' </p>
        <p>"Alfred!'' she cried. "Great Heaven! My child! My boy!'' </p>
        <p>On this the medium arose, and became <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0170" n="145"/>
          strangely convulsed. "I see,'' he said &mdash; "I see &mdash; a
          fair-haired boy. I see blue eyes &mdash; I see above you, beyond you
          &mdash; '' at the same time pointing fixedly over her head. </p>
        <p>She turned with a wild start. "Where &mdash; whereabouts?'' </p>
        <p>"A blue-eyed boy,'' he continued, "over your head. He cries &mdash; he
          says, `Mama, mama!' '' </p>
        <p>The effect of this on the woman was unpleasant. She stared about her for a
          moment, and exclaiming, "I come &mdash; I am coming, Alfy!'' fell in
          hysterics on the floor. </p>
        <p>Two or three persons raised her, and aided her into an adjoining room; but the
          rest remained at the table, as though well accustomed to like scenes. </p>
        <p>After this several of the strangers were called upon to write the names of the
          dead with whom they wished to communicate. The names were spelled out by the
          agency of affirmative knocks when the correct letters were touched by the
          applicant, who was furnished with an alphabet-card upon which he tapped the
          letters in turn, the medium, meanwhile, scanning his face very keenly. With
          some, the names were readily made out. With one, a stolid personage of <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0171" n="146"/> disbelieving type, every attempt
          failed, until at last the spirits signified by knocks that he was a disturbing
          agency, and that while he remained all our efforts would fail. Upon this some of
          the company proposed that he should leave; of which invitation he took
          advantage, with a skeptical sneer at the whole performance. </p>
        <p>As he left us, the sergeant leaned over and whispered to the medium, who next
          addressed himself to me. "Sister Euphemia,'' he said, indicating the lady with
          large eyes, "will act as your medium. I am unable to do more. These things
          exhaust my nervous system.'' </p>
        <p>"Sister Euphemia,'' said the doctor, "will aid us. Think, if you please, sir,
          of a spirit, and she will endeavor to summon it to our circle.'' </p>
        <p>Upon this a wild idea came into my head. I answered: "I am thinking as you
          directed me to do.'' </p>
        <p>The medium sat with her arms folded, looking steadily at the center of the
          table. For a few moments there was silence. Then a series of irregular knocks
          began. "Are you present?'' said the medium. </p>
        <p>The affirmative raps were twice given. <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0172" n="147"
          />
        </p>
        <p>"I should think,'' said the doctor, "that there were two spirits present.'' </p>
        <p>His words sent a thrill through my heart. </p>
        <p>"Are there two?'' he questioned. </p>
        <p>A double rap. </p>
        <p>"Yes, two,'' said the medium. "Will it please the spirits to make us conscious
          of their names in this world?'' </p>
        <p>A single knock. "No.'' </p>
        <p>"Will it please them to say how they are called in the world of spirits?'' </p>
        <p>Again came the irregular raps &mdash; 3, 4, 8, 6; then a pause, and 3, 4,
          8, 7. </p>
        <p>"I think,'' said the authoress, "they must be numbers. Will the spirits,'' she
          said, "be good enough to aid us? Shall we use the alphabet?'' </p>
        <p>"Yes,'' was rapped very quickly. </p>
        <p>"Are these numbers?'' </p>
        <p>"Yes,'' again. </p>
        <p>"I will write them,'' she added, and, doing so, took up the card and tapped the
          letters. The spelling was pretty rapid, and ran thus as she tapped, in turn,
          first the letters, and last the numbers she had already set down: </p>
        <p>"UNITED STATES ARMY MEDICAL MUSEUM, Nos. 3486, 3487.'' <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002082_0173" n="148"/>
        </p>
        <p>The medium looked up with a puzzled expression. </p>
        <p>"Good gracious!'' said I, "they are <hi rend="italic">my legs &mdash; my
            legs!</hi>'' </p>
        <p>What followed, I ask no one to believe except those who, like myself, have
          communed with the things of another sphere. Suddenly I felt a strange return of
          my self-consciousness. I was reindividualized, so to speak. A strange wonder
          filled me, and, to the amazement of every one, I arose, and, staggering a
          little, walked across the room on limbs invisible to them or me. It was no
          wonder I staggered, for, as I briefly reflected, my legs had been nine months in
          the strongest alcohol. At this instant all my new friends crowded around me in
          astonishment. Presently, however, I felt myself sinking slowly. My legs were
          going, and in a moment I was resting feebly on my two stumps upon the floor. It
          was too much. All that was left of me fainted and rolled over senseless. </p>
        <p>I have little to add. I am now at home in the West, surrounded by every form of
          kindness and every possible comfort; but alas! I have so little surety of being
          myself that I doubt my own honesty in drawing my pension, and feel absolved from
          gratitude to <pb entity="DSSR_000002082_0174" n="149"/> those who are kind to a
          being who is uncertain of being enough himself to be conscientiously
          responsible. It is needless to add that I am not a happy fraction of a man, and
          that I am eager for the day when I shall rejoin the lost members of my corporeal
          family in another and a happier world.</p>
