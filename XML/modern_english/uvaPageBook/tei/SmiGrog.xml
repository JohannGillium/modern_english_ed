                <head>I<lb/> BABCOCK'S DISCOVERY</head>
                <p> SOMETHING worried Babcock. One could see that from the impatient gesture with
                    which he turned away from the ferry window on learning he had half an hour to
                    wait. He paced the slip with hands deep in his pockets, his head on his chest.
                    Every now and then he stopped, snapped open his watch and shut it again quickly,
                    as if to hurry the lagging minutes. </p>
                <p> For the first time in years Tom Grogan, who had always unloaded his boats, had
                    failed him. A scow loaded with stone for the sea-wall that Babcock was building
                    for the Lighthouse Department had lain three days at the government dock without
                    a bucket having been swung across her decks. His foreman had just reported that
                    there was not enough material to last the concrete-mixers <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0023" n="2"/> two hours. If Grogan did not begin work
                    at once, the divers must come up. </p>
                <p> Heretofore to turn over to Grogan the unloading of material for any submarine
                    work had been like feeding grist to a mill--so many tons of concrete stone
                    loaded on the scows by the stone crushing company had meant that exact amount
                    delivered by Grogan on Babcock's mixing-platforms twenty-four hours after
                    arrival, ready for the divers below. This was the way Grogan had worked, and he
                    had required no watching. </p>
                <p> Babcock's impatience did not cease even when he took his seat on the upper deck
                    of the ferry-boat and caught the welcome sound of the paddles sweeping back to
                    the landing at St. George. He thought of his men standing idle, and of the heavy
                    penalties which would be inflicted by the Government if the winter caught him
                    before the section of wall was complete. It was no way to serve a man, he kept
                    repeating to himself, leaving his gangs idle, now when the good weather might
                    soon be over and a full day's work could never be counted upon. Earlier in the
                    season Grogan's delay would not have been so serious. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0024" n="3"/>

                <p> But one northeaster as yet had struck the work. This had carried away some of
                    the upper planking--the false work of the coffer-dam; but this had been repaired
                    in a few hours without delay or serious damage. After that the Indian summer had
                    set in--soft, dreamy days when the winds dozed by the hour, the waves nibbled
                    along the shores, and the swelling breast of the ocean rose and fell as if in
                    gentle slumber. </p>
                <p> But would this good weather last? Babcock rose hurriedly, as this anxiety again
                    took possession of him, and leaned over the deck-rail, scanning the sky. He did
                    not like the drift of the low clouds off to the west; southeasters began that
                    way. It looked as though the wind might change. </p>
                <p> Some men would not have worried over these possibilities. Babcock did. He was
                    that kind of man. </p>
                <p> When the boat touched the shore, he sprang over the chains, and hurried through
                    the ferry-slip. </p>
                <p> "Keep an eye out, sir," the bridge-tender called after him,--he had been
                    directing him to Grogan's house,--"perhaps Tom may be on the road." </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0025" n="4"/>

                <p> Then it suddenly occurred to Babcock that, so far as he could remember, he had
                    never seen Mr. Thomas Grogan, his stevedore. He knew Grogan's name, of course,
                    and would have recognized his signature affixed to the little cramped notes with
                    which his orders were always acknowledged, but the man himself might have passed
                    unnoticed within three feet of him. This is not unusual where the work of a
                    contractor lies in scattered places, and he must often depend on strangers in
                    the several localities. </p>
                <p> As he hurried over the road he recalled the face of Grogan's foreman, a big
                    blond Swede, and that of Grogan's daughter, a slender fair-haired girl, who once
                    came to the office for her father's pay; but all efforts at reviving the
                    lineaments of Grogan failed. </p>
                <p> With this fact clear in his mind, he felt a tinge of disappointment. It would
                    have relieved his temper to unload a portion of it upon the offending stevedore.
                    Nothing cools a man's wrath so quickly as not knowing the size of the head he
                    intends to hit. </p>
                <p> As he approached near enough to the sea-wall to distinguish the swinging booms
                    and the puffs of white steam from the hoisting-engines, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0026" n="5"/> he saw that the main derrick was at
                    work lowering the buckets of mixed concrete to the divers. Instantly his spirits
                    rose. The delay on his contract might not be so serious. Perhaps, after all,
                    Grogan had started work. </p>
                <p> When he reached the temporary wooden fence built by the Government, shutting off
                    the view of the depot yard, with its coal-docks and machine-shops, and neared
                    the small door cut through its planking, a voice rang out clear and strong above
                    the din of the mixers:-- </p>
                <p> "Hold on, ye wall-eyed macaroni! Do ye want that fall cut? Turn that
                    snatch-block, Cully, and tighten up the watch-tackle. Here, cap'n; lend a hand.
                    Lively now, lively, before I straighten out the hull gang of ye!" </p>
                <p> The voice had a ring of unquestioned authority. It was not quarrelsome or
                    abusive or bullying--only earnest and forceful. </p>
                <p> "Ease away on that guy! Ease away, I tell ye!" it continued, rising in
                    intensity. "So--all gone! Now, haul out, Cully, and let that other team back
                    up." </p>
                <p> Babcock pushed open the door in the fence and stepped in. A loaded scow lay
                    close beside <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0027" n="6"/> the string-piece of the
                    government wharf. Alongside its forward hatch was rigged a derrick with a
                    swinging gaff. The "fall" led through a snatch-block in the planking of the
                    dock, and operated an iron bucket that was hoisted by a big gray horse driven by
                    a boy. A gang of men were filling these buckets, and a number of teams being
                    loaded with their dumped contents. The captain of the scow was on the dock,
                    holding the guy. </p>
                <p> At the foot of the derrick, within ten feet of Babcock, stood a woman perhaps
                    thirty-five years of age, with large, clear gray eyes, made all the more
                    luminous by the deep, rich color of her sunburnt skin. Her teeth were
                    snow-white, and her light brown hair was neatly parted over a wide forehead. She
                    wore a long ulster half concealing her well-rounded, muscular figure, and a
                    black silk hood rolled back from her face, the strings falling over her broad
                    shoulders, revealing a red silk scarf loosely wound about her throat, the two
                    ends tucked in her bosom. Her feet were shod in thick-soled shoes laced around
                    her well-turned ankles, and her hands were covered by buckskin gauntlets creased
                    with wear. From the outside breast-pocket <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0028" n="7"
                    /> of her ulster protruded a time-book, from which dangled a pencil fastened to
                    a hempen string. Every movement indicated great physical strength, perfect
                    health, and a thorough control of herself and her surroundings. Coupled with
                    this was a dignity and repose unmistakable to those who have watched the
                    handling of large bodies of workingmen by some one leading spirit, master in
                    every tone of the voice and every gesture of the body. The woman gave Babcock a
                    quick glance of interrogation as he entered, and, receiving no answer, forgot
                    him instantly. </p>
                <p> "Come, now, ye blatherin' Dagos,"--this time to two Italian shovelers filling
                    the buckets,--" shall I throw one of ye overboard to wake ye up, or will I take
                    a hand meself? Another shovel there--that bucket 's not half full "--drawing one
                    hand from her side pocket and pointing with an authoritative gesture, breaking
                    as suddenly into a good-humored laugh over the awkwardness of their movements. </p>
                <p> Babcock, with all his curiosity aroused, watched her for a moment, forgetting
                    for the time his own anxieties. He liked a skilled hand, and he liked push and
                    grit. This <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0029" n="8"/> woman seemed to possess all
                    three. He was amazed at the way in which she handled her men. He wished somebody
                    as clearheaded and as capable were unloading his boat. He began to wonder who
                    she might be. There was no mistaking her nationality. Slight as was her accent,
                    her direct descent from the land of the shamrock and the shilla-lah was not to
                    be doubted. The very tones of her voice seemed saturated with its national
                    spirit--"a flower for you when you agree with me, and a broken head when you
                    don't." But underneath all these outward indications of dominant power and great
                    physical strength he detected in the lines of the mouth and eyes a certain
                    refinement of nature. There was, too, a fresh, rosy wholesomeness, a sweet
                    cleanliness, about the woman. These, added to the noble lines of her figure,
                    would have appealed to one as beauty, and only that had it not been that the
                    firm mouth, well-set chin, and deep, penetrating glance of the eye overpowered
                    all other impressions. </p>
                <p> Babcock moved down beside her. </p>
                <p> "Can you tell me, madam, where I can find Thomas Grogan?" </p>
                <p> "Right in front of ye," she answered, turning <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0030"
                        n="9"/> quickly, with a toss of her head like that of a great hound baffled
                    in hunt. "I 'm Tom Grogan. What can I do for ye?" </p>
                <p> "Not Grogan the stevedore?" Babcock asked in astonishment. </p>
                <p> "Yes, Grogan the stevedore. Come! Make it short,--what can I do for ye!" </p>
                <p> "Then this must be my boat. I came down"-- </p>
                <p> "Ye 're not the boss? "--looking him over slowly from his feet up, a
                    good-natured smile irradiating her face, her eyes beaming, every tooth
                    glistening. "There 's me hand, I 'm glad to see ye. I 've worked for ye off and
                    on for four years, and niver laid eyes on ye till this minute. Don't say a word.
                    I know it. I 've kept the concrete gangs back half a day, but I could n't help
                    it. I 've had four horses down with the 'zooty, and two men laid up with
                    dip'thery. The Big Gray Cully 's drivin' over there--the one that 's
                    a-hoistin'--ain't fit to be out of the stables. If ye weren't behind in the
                    work, he'd have two blankets on him this minute. But I 'm here meself now, and I
                    'll have her out to-night if I work till daylight. Here, cap'n, pull yerself
                    together. This is the boss." </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0031" n="10"/>

                <p> Then catching sight of the boy turning a handspring behind the horse, she called
                    out again:-- </p>
                <p> "Now, look here, Cully, none of your skylarkin'. There 's the dinner whistle.
                    Unhitch the Big Gray; he 's as dry as a bone." </p>
                <p> The boy loosened the traces and led the horse to water, and Babcock, after a
                    word with the Captain, and an encouraging smile to Tom, turned away. He meant to
                    go to the engineer's office before his return to town, now that his affairs with
                    Grogan were settled. As he swung back the door in the board fence, he stumbled
                    over a mere scrap of humanity carrying a dinner-pail. The mite was peering
                    through the crack and calling to Cully at the horse-trough. He proved to be a
                    boy of perhaps seven or eight years of age, but with the face of an old
                    man--pinched, weary, and scarred all over with suffering and pain. He wore a
                    white tennis-cap pulled over his eyes, and a short gray jacket that reached to
                    his waist. Under one arm was a wooden crutch. His left leg was bent at the knee,
                    and swung clear when he jerked his little body along the ground. The other,
                    though unhurt, was thin and bony, the <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0032" n="11"/>
                    yarn stocking wrinkling over the shrunken calf. </p>
                <p> Beside him stood a big billy-goat, harnessed to a two-wheeled cart made of a
                    soap-box. </p>
                <p> As Babcock stepped aside to let the boy pass he heard Cully shouting in answer
                    to the little cripple's cries. "Cheese it, Patsy. Here 's Pete Lathers comin'
                    down de yard. Look out fer Stumpy. He'll have his dog on him." </p>
                <p> Patsy laid down the pail and crept through the door again, drawing the crutch
                    after him. The yardmaster passed with a bulldog at his heels, and touching his
                    hat to the contractor, turned the corner of the coal-shed. </p>
                <p> "What is your name?" said Babcock gently. A cripple always appealed to him,
                    especially a child. </p>
                <p> "My name 's Patsy, sir," looking straight up into Babcock's eyes, the goat
                    nibbling at his thin hand. </p>
                <p> "And who are you looking for?" </p>
                <p> "I come down with mother's dinner, sir. She 's here working on the dock. There
                    she is now." </p>
                <p> "I thought ye were niver comin' wid that dinner, darlint," came a woman's voice.
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0033" n="12"/> "What kept ye? Stumpy was tired,
                    was he? Well, niver mind." </p>
                <p> The woman lifted the little fellow in her arms, pushed back his cap and smoothed
                    his hair with her fingers, her whole face beaming with tenderness. </p>
                <p> "Gimme the crutch, darlint, and hold on to me tight, and we 'll get under the
                    shed out of the sun till I see what Jennie 's sent me." At this instant she
                    caught Babcock's eye. </p>
                <p> "Oh, it 's the boss. Sure, I thought ye'd gone back. Pull the hat off ye, me
                    boy; it 's the boss we 're workin' for, the man that 's buildin' the wall. Ye
                    see, sir, when I 'm driv' like I am to-day, I can't go home to dinner, and me
                    Jennie sends me--big--man--Patsy--down"--rounding out each word in a pompous
                    tone, as she slipped her hand under the boy's chin and kissed him on the cheek. </p>
                <p> After she had propped him between two big spars, she lifted the cover of the tin
                    pail. </p>
                <p> "Pigs' feet, as I 'm alive, and hot cabbage, and the coffee a-b'ilin' too!" she
                    said, turning to the boy and pulling out a tin flask with a screw top, the whole
                    embedded in the smoking <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0034" n="13"/>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0035" n="14"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0036" n="15"/> cabbage. "There, we'll be after
                    puttin' it where Stumpy can't be rubbin' his nose in it"--setting the pail, as
                    she spoke, on a rough anchor-stone. </p>
                <p> Here the goat moved up, rubbing his head in the boy's face, and then reaching
                    around for the pail. </p>
                <p> "Look at him, Patsy! Git out, ye imp, or I 'll hurt ye! Leave that kiver alone!"
                    She laughed as she struck at the goat with her empty gauntlet, and shrank back
                    out of the way of his horns. </p>
                <p> There was no embarrassment over her informal dinner, eaten as she sat squat in a
                    fence-corner, an anchor-stone for a table, and a pile of spars for a chair. She
                    talked to Babcock in an unabashed, self-possessed way, pouring out the smoking
                    coffee in the flask cup, chewing away on the pigs' feet, and throwing the bones
                    to the goat, who sniffed them contemptuously. "Yes, he 's the youngest of our
                    children, sir. He and Jennie--that 's home, and 'most as tall as meself--are all
                    that 's left. The other two went to heaven when they was little ones," </p>
                <p> "Can't the little fellow's leg be straightened?" asked Babcock, in a tone which
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0037" n="16"/> plainly showed his sympathy for
                    the boy's suffering. </p>
                <p> "No, not now; so Dr. Mason says. There was a time when it might have been, but I
                    could n't take him. I had him over to Quarantine again two years ago, but it was
                    too late; it'd growed fast, they said. When he was four years old he would be
                    under the horses' heels all the time, and a-climbin' over them in the stable,
                    and one day the Big Gray fetched him a crack, and broke his hip. He did n't mean
                    it, for he 's as dacint a horse as I've got; but the boys had been a-worritin'
                    him, and he let drive, thinkin', most likely, it was them. He 's been a-hoistin'
                    all the mornin'." Then, catching sight of Cully leading the horse back to work,
                    she rose to her feet, all the fire and energy renewed in her face. </p>
                <p> "Shake the men up, Cully! I can't give 'em but half an hour to-day. We 're
                    behind time now. And tell the cap'n to pull them macaronis out of the hold, and
                    start two of 'em to trimmin' some of that stone to starboard. She was a-listin'
                    when we knocked off for dinner. Come, lively!" </p>

                <head>II<lb/> A BOARD FENCE LOSES A PLANK</head>
                <p> THE work on the sea-wall progressed. The coffer-dam which had been built by
                    driving into the mud of the bottom a double row of heavy tongued and grooved
                    planking in two parallel rows, and bulkheading each end with heavy boards, had
                    been filled with concrete to low-water mark, consuming not only the contents of
                    the delayed scow, but two subsequent cargoes, both of which had been unloaded by
                    Tom Grogan. </p>
                <p> To keep out the leakage, steam-pumps were kept going night and day. </p>
                <p> By dint of hard work the upper masonry of the wall had been laid to the top
                    course, ready for the coping, and there was now every prospect that the last
                    stone would be lowered into place before the winter storms set in. </p>
                <p> The shanty--a temporary structure, good only for the life of the work--rested on
                    a <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0039" n="18"/> set of stringers laid on extra piles
                    driven outside of the working-platform. When the submarine work lies miles from
                    shore, a shanty is the only shelter for the men, its interior being arranged
                    with sleeping-bunks, with one end partitioned off for a kitchen and a
                    storage-room. This last is filled with perishable property, extra blocks, Manila
                    rope, portable forges, tools, shovels, and barrows. </p>
                <p> For this present sea-wall--an amphibious sort of structure, with one foot on
                    land and the other in the water--the shanty was of light pine boards, roofed
                    over, and made water-tight by tarred paper. The bunks had been omitted, for most
                    of the men boarded in the village. In this way increased space for the storage
                    of tools was gained, besides room for a desk containing the government working
                    drawings and specifications, pay-rolls, etc. In addition to its door, fastened
                    at night with a padlock, and its one glass window, secured by a ten-penny nail,
                    the shanty had a flap-window, hinged at the bottom. When this was propped up
                    with a barrel stave it made a counter from which to pay the men, the paymaster
                    standing inside. </p>
                <p> Babcock was sitting on a keg of dock spikes <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0040"
                        n="19"/> inside this working shanty some days after he had discovered Tom's
                    identity, watching his bookkeeper preparing the pay-roll, when a face was thrust
                    through the square of the window. It was not a prepossessing face, rather pudgy
                    and sleek, with uncertain, drooping mouth, and eyes that always looked over
                    one's head when he talked. It was the property of Mr. Peter Lathers, the
                    yardmaster of the depot. </p>
                <p> "When you're done payin' off maybe you'll step outside, sir," he said, in a
                    confiding tone. "I got a friend of mine who wants to know you. He 's a
                    stevedore, and does the work to the fort. He 's never done nothin' for you, but
                    I told him next time you come down I 'd fetch him over. Say, Dan!" beckoning
                    with his head over his shoulder; then, turning to Babcock,--"I make you
                    acquainted, sir, with Mr. Daniel McGaw." </p>
                <p> Two faces now filled the window--Lathers's and that of a red-headed man in a
                    straw hat. </p>
                <p> "All right. I 'll attend to you in a moment. Glad to see you, Mr. McGaw," said
                    Babcock, rising from the keg, and looking over his bookkeeper's shoulder. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0041" n="20"/>

                <p> Lathers's friend proved to be a short, big-boned, square-shouldered Irishman,
                    about forty years of age, dressed in a once black broadcloth suit with frayed
                    buttonholes, the lapels and vest covered with grease-spots. Around his collar,
                    which had done service for several days, was twisted a red tie decorated with a
                    glass pin. His face was spattered with blue powder-marks, as if from some quarry
                    explosion. A lump of a mustache dyed dark brown concealed his upper lip, making
                    all the more conspicuous the bushy, sandy-colored eyebrows that shaded a pair of
                    treacherous eyes. His mouth was coarse and filled with teeth half worn off, like
                    those of an old horse. When he smiled these opened slowly like a vise. Whatever
                    of humor played about this opening lost its life instantly when these jaws
                    clicked together again. </p>
                <p> The hands were big and strong, wrinkled and seamed, their rough backs spotted
                    like a toad's, the wrists covered with long spidery hairs. </p>
                <p> Babcock noticed particularly his low, flat forehead when he removed his hat, and
                    the dry, red hair growing close to the eyebrows. </p>
                <p> "I wuz a-sp'akin' to me fri'nd Mister <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0042" n="21"/>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0043" n="22"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0044" n="23"/> Lathers about doin' yer wurruk," began
                    McGaw, resting one foot on a pile of barrow-planks, his elbow on his knee. "I
                    does all the haulin' to the foort. Surgint Duffy knows me. I wuz along here las'
                    week, an' see ye wuz put back fer stone. If I 'd had the job, I 'd had her
                    unloaded two days befoore." </p>
                <p> "You're dead right, Dan," said Lathers, with an expression of disgust. "This
                    woman business ain't no good, nohow. She ought to be over her tubs." </p>
                <p> "She does her work, though," Babcock said, beginning to see the drift of things. </p>
                <p> "Oh, I don't be sayin' she don't. She 's a dacint woman, anough; but thim b'ys
                    as is a-runnin' her carts is raisin' h--ll all the toime." </p>
                <p> "And then look at the teams," chimed in Lathers, with a jerk of his thumb toward
                    the dock--"a lot of staggering horse-car wrecks you couldn't sell to a
                    glue-factory. That big gray she had a-hoistin' is blind of an eye and sprung so
                    forrard he can't hardly stand." </p>
                <p> At this moment the refrain of a song from somewhere near the board fence came
                    wafting through the air,--</p>


                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0045" n="24"/>

                <p> McGaw turned his head in search of the singer, and not finding him, resumed his
                    position. </p>
                <p> "What are your rates per ton?" asked Babcock. </p>
                <p> "We 're a-chargin' forty cints," said McGaw, deferring to Lathers, as if for
                    confirmation. </p>
                <p> "Who 's 'we'?" </p>
                <p> "The Stevedores' Union." </p>
                <p> "But Mrs. Grogan is doing it for thirty," said Babcock, looking straight into
                    McGaw's eyes, and speaking slowly and deliberately. </p>
                <p> "Yis, I heared she wuz a-cuttin' rates; but she can't live at it. If I does it,
                    it 'll be done roight, an' no throuble." </p>
                <p> "I'll think it over," said Babcock quietly, turning on his heel. The meanness of
                    the whole affair offended him--two big, strong men vilifying a woman with no
                    protector but her two hands. McGaw should never lift a shovel for him. </p>
                <p> Again the song floated out; this time it seemed nearer,--</p>
                <q>
                    <lg>
                        <l>"...wid McGeechy--</l>
                        <l>McGeechy of the Fourth."</l>
                    </lg>
                </q>
                <p> "Dan McGaw's giv'n it to you straight," <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0046" n="25"
                    /> said Lathers, stopping for a last word, his face thrust through the window
                    again. "He 's rigged for this business, and Grogan ain't in it with him. If she
                    wants her work done right, she ought to send down something with a mustache." </p>
                <p> Here the song subsided in a prolonged chuckle. McGaw turned, and caught sight of
                    a boy's head, with its mop of black hair thrust through a crownless hat, leaning
                    over a water cask. Lathers turned, too, and instantly lowered his voice. The
                    head ducked out of sight. In the flash glance Babcock caught of the face, he
                    recognized the boy Cully, Patsy's friend, and the driver of the Big Gray. It was
                    evident to Babcock that Cully at that moment was bubbling over with fun. Indeed,
                    this waif of the streets, sometimes called James Finnegan, was seldom known to
                    be otherwise. </p>
                <p> "Thet 's the wurrst rat in the stables," said McGaw, his face reddening with
                    anger. "What kin ye do whin ye 're a-buckin' ag'in' a lot uv divils loike
                    him?"--speaking through the window to Babcock. "Come out uv thet," he called to
                    Cully, "or I 'll bu'st yer jaw, ye sneakin' rat!" </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0047" n="26"/>

                <p> Cully came out, but not in obedience to McGaw or Lathers. Indeed, he paid no
                    more attention to either of those distinguished diplomats than if they had been
                    two cement-barrels standing on end. His face, too, had lost its irradiating
                    smile; not a wrinkle or a pucker ruffled its calm surface. His clay-soiled hat
                    was in his hand--a very dirty hand, by the way, with the torn cuff of his shirt
                    hanging loosely over it. His trousers bagged everywhere--at knees, seat, and
                    waist. On his stockingless feet were a pair of sun-baked, brick-colored shoes.
                    His ankles were as dark as mahogany. His throat and chest were bare, the skin
                    tanned to leather wherever the sun could work its way through the holes in his
                    garments. From out of this combination of dust and rags shone a pair of piercing
                    black eyes, snapping with fun. </p>
                <p> "I come up fer de mont's pay," he said coolly to Babcock, the corner of his eye
                    glued to Lathers. "De ole woman said ye 'd hev it ready." </p>
                <p> "Mrs. Grogan's?" asked the bookkeeper, shuffling over his envelopes. </p>
                <p> "Yep. Tom Grogan." </p>
                <p> "Can you sign the pay-roll?" </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0048" n="27"/>

                <p> "You bet"--with an eye still out for Lathers. </p>
                <p> "Where did you learn to write--at school?" asked Babcock, noting the boy's
                    independence with undisguised pleasure. </p>
                <p> "Naw. Patsy an' me studies nights. Pop Mullins teaches us--he 's de ole woman's
                    farder what she brung out from Ireland. He 's a-livin' up ter de shebang; dey're
                    all a-livin' dere--Jinnie an' de ole woman an' Patsy--all 'cept me an' Carl. I
                    bunks in wid de Big Gray. Say, mister, ye 'd oughter git onter Patsy--he 's de
                    little kid wid de crutch. He 's a corker, he is; reads po'try an' everythin'.
                    Where 'll I sign? Oh, I see; in dis 'ere square hole right along-side de ole
                    woman's name"--spreading his elbows, pen in hand, and affixing "James Finnegan"
                    to the collection of autographs. The next moment he was running along the dock,
                    the money envelope tight in his hand, sticking out his tongue at McGaw, and
                    calling to Lathers as he disappeared through the door in the fence, "Somp'n wid
                    a <hi rend="italic">mus</hi>tache, somp'n wid a <hi rend="italic"
                    >mus</hi>tache," like a news-boy calling an extra. Then a stone grazed Lathers's
                    ear. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0049" n="28"/>

                <p> Lathers sprang through the gate, but the boy was half way through the yard. It
                    was this flea-like alertness that always saved Mr. Finnegan's scalp. </p>
                <p> Once out of Lathers's reach, Cully bounded up the road like a careering letter
                    X, with arms and legs in air. If there was any one thing that delighted the
                    boy's soul, it was, to quote from his own picturesque vocabulary, "to set up a
                    job on de ole woman." Here was his chance. Before he reached the stable he had
                    planned the whole scene, even to the exact intonation of Lathers's voice when he
                    referred to the dearth of mustaches in the Grogan household. Within a few
                    minutes of his arrival the details of the whole occurrence, word for word, with
                    such picturesque additions as his own fertile imagination could invent, were
                    common talk about the yard. </p>
                <p> Lathers meanwhile had been called upon to direct a gang of laborers who were
                    moving an enormous iron buoy-float down the cinder-covered path to the dock. Two
                    of the men walked beside the buoy, steadying it with their hands. Lathers was
                    leaning against the board fence of the shop whittling a stick, while the others
                    worked. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0050" n="29"/>

                <p> Suddenly there was an angry cry for Lathers, and every man stood still. So did
                    the buoy and the moving truck. </p>
                <p> With head up, eyes blazing, her silk hood pushed back from her face, as if to
                    give her air, her gray ulster open to her waist, her right hand bare of a glove,
                    came Tom Grogan, brushing the men out of her way. </p>
                <p> "I knew I'd find you, Pete Lathers," she said, facing him squarely; "why do ye
                    want to be takin' the bread out of me children's mouths? " </p>
                <p> The stick dropped from Lathers's hand: "Well, who said I did? What have I got to
                    do with your"-- </p>
                <p> "You 've got enough to do with 'em, you and your friend McGaw, to want 'em to
                    starve. Have I ever hurt ye that ye should try an' sneak me business away from
                    me? Ye know very well the fight I 've made, standin' out on this dock, many a
                    day an' night, in the cold an' wet, with nothin' between Tom's children an' the
                    street but these two hands--an' yet ye'd slink in like a dog to get me"-- </p>
                <p> "Here, now, I ain't a-goin' to have no row," said Lathers, twitching his
                    shoulders. "It 's against orders, an' I 'll call the yard-watch, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0051" n="30"/> and throw you out if you make any
                    fuss." </p>
                <p> "The yard-watch!" said Tom, with a look of supreme contempt. "I can handle any
                    two of 'em, an' ye too, an' ye know it." Her cheeks were aflame. She crowded
                    Lathers so closely his slinking figure hugged the fence. </p>
                <p> By this time the gang had abandoned the buoy, and were standing aghast, watching
                    the fury of the Amazon. </p>
                <p> "Now, see here, don't make a muss; the commandant 'll be down here in a minute." </p>
                <p> "Let him come; he 's the one I want to see. If he knew he had a man in his pay
                    that would do as dirty a trick to a woman as ye 've done to me, his name would
                    be Dinnis. I 'll see him meself this very day, and"-- </p>
                <p> Here Lathers interrupted with an angry gesture. </p>
                <p> "Don't ye lift yer arm at me," she blazes out, "or I 'll break it at the wrist!" </p>
                <p> Lathers's hand dropped. All the color was out of his face, his lip quivering. </p>
                <p> "Whoever said I said a word against you, Mrs. Grogan, is a--liar." It was the
                    last resort of a cowardly nature. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0052" n="31"/>

                <p> "Stop lyin' to me, Pete Lathers! If there 's anythin' in this world I hate, it
                    's a liar. Ye said it, and ye know ye said it. Ye want that drunken loafer Dan
                    McGaw to get me work. Ye've been at it all summer, an' ye think I have n't
                    watched ye; but I have. And ye say I don't pay full wages, and have got a lot of
                    boys to do men's work, an' oughter be over me tubs. Now let me tell ye"--Lathers
                    shrank back, cowering before her--"if ever I hear ye openin' yer head about me,
                    or me teams, or me work, I 'll make ye swallow every tooth in yer head. Send
                    down somethin' with a mustache, will I? There 's not a man in the yard that 's a
                    match for me, an' ye know it. Let one of 'em try that." </p>
                <p> Her uplifted fist, tight-clenched, shot past Lathers's ear. A quick blow, a
                    plank knocked clear of its fastenings, and a flood of daylight broke in behind
                    Lathers's head! </p>
                <p> "Now, the next time I come, Pete Lathers," she said firmly, "I 'll miss the
                    plank and take yer face." </p>
                <p> Then she turned, and stalked out of the yard. </p>

                <head>III<lb/> SERGEANT DUFFY'S LITTLE GAME</head>
                <p> THE bad weather so long expected finally arrived. An afternoon of soft, warm
                    autumn skies, aglow with the radiance of the setting sun, and brilliant in
                    violet and gold, had been followed by a cold, gray morning. Of a sudden a cloud
                    the size of a hand had mounted clear of the horizon, and called together its
                    fellows. An unseen herald in the east blew a blast, and winds and sea awoke. </p>
                <p> By nine o'clock a gale was blowing. By ten Babcock's men were bracing the outer
                    sheathing of the coffer-dam, strengthening the derrick-guys, tightening the
                    anchor-lines, and clearing the working-platforms of sand, cement, and other
                    damageable property. The course-masonry, fortunately, was above the water-line,
                    but the coping was still unset and the rubble backing of much of the wall
                    unfinished. Two weeks of constant work were necessary before that part of the
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0054" n="33"/> structure contained in the first
                    section of the contract would be entirely safe for the coming winter. Babcock
                    doubled his gangs, and utilized every hour of low water to the utmost, even when
                    the men stood waist-deep. It was his only hope for completing the first section
                    that season. After that would come the cold, freezing the mortar, and ending
                    everything. </p>
                <p> Tom Grogan performed wonders. Not only did she work her teams far into the
                    night, but during all this bad weather she stood throughout the day on the
                    unprotected dock, a man's sou'wester covering her head, a rubber waterproof
                    reaching to her feet. She directed every boat-load herself, and rushed the
                    materials to the shovelers, who stood soaking wet in the driving rain. </p>
                <p> Lathers avoided her; so did McGaw. Everybody else watched her in admiration.
                    Even the commandant, a bluff, gray-bearded naval officer,--a hero of Hampton
                    Roads and Memphis,--passed her on his morning inspection with a kindly look in
                    his face and an aside to Babcock: "Hire some more like her. She is worth a dozen
                    men." </p>
                <p> Not until the final cargo required for the <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0055"
                        n="34"/> completion of the wall had been dumped on the platforms did she
                    relax her vigilance. Then she shook the water from her oilskins and started for
                    home. During all these hours of constant strain there was no outbreak of
                    bravado, no spell of ill humor. She made no boasts or promises. With a certain
                    buoyant pluck she stood by the derricks day after day, firing volleys of
                    criticism or encouragement, as best suited the exigencies of the moment, now she
                    sprang forward to catch a sagging bucket, now tended a guy to relieve a man, or
                    handled the teams herself when the line of carts was blocked or stalled. </p>
                <p> Every hour she worked increased Babcock's confidence and admiration. He began to
                    feel a certain pride in her, and to a certain extent to rely upon her. Such
                    capacity, endurance, and loyalty were new in his experience. If she owed him
                    anything for her delay on that first cargo, the debt had been amply paid. Yet he
                    saw that no such sense of obligation had influenced her. To her this extra work
                    had been a duty: he was behind-hand with the wall, and anxious; she would help
                    him out. As to the weather, she reveled in it. The dash of the spray and the
                    driving <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0056" n="35"/> rain only added to her
                    enjoyment. The clatter of rattling buckets and the rhythmic movement of the
                    shovelers keeping time to her orders made a music as dear to her as that of the
                    steady tramp of men and the sound of arms to a division commander. </p>
                <p> Owing to the continued bad weather and the difficulty of shipping small
                    quantities of fuel, the pumping-engines ran out of coal, and a complaint from
                    Babcock's office brought the agent of the coal company to the sea-wall. In times
                    like these Babcock rarely left his work. Once let the Old Man of the Sea, as he
                    knew, get his finger in between the cracks of a coffer-dam, and he would smash
                    the whole into wreckage. </p>
                <p> "I was on my way to see Tom Grogan," said the agent. "I heard you were here, so
                    I stopped to tell you about the coal. There will be a load down in the morning.
                    I am Mr. Crane, of Crane &amp; Co., coal-dealers." </p>
                <p> "You know Mrs. Grogan, then?" asked Babcock, after the delay in the delivery of
                    the coal had been explained. He had been waiting for some such opportunity to
                    discover more about his stevedore. He never discussed personalities with his
                    men. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0057" n="36"/>

                <p> "Well, I should say so--known her for years. Best woman on top of Staten Island.
                    Does she work for you?" </p>
                <p> "Yes, and has for some years; but I must confess I never knew Grogan was a woman
                    until I found her on the dock a few weeks ago, handling a cargo. She works like
                    a machine. How long has she been a widow?" </p>
                <p> "Well, come to think of it, I don't know that she is a widow. There 's some
                    mystery about the old man, but I never knew what. But that don't count; she 's
                    good enough as she is, and a hustler, too." </p>
                <p> Crane was something of a hustler himself--one of those busy Americans who opens
                    his daily life with an office-key and closes it with a letter for the late mail.
                    He was a restless, wiry, black-eyed little man, never still for a moment, and
                    perpetually in chase of another eluding dollar,--which half the time he caught. </p>
                <p> Then, laying his hand on Babcock's arm: "And she 's square as a brick, too.
                    Sometimes when a chunker captain, waiting to unload, shoves a few tons aboard a
                    sneak-boat at night, Tom will spot him every time. They try to fool her into
                    indorsing their <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0058" n="37"/> bills of lading in
                    full, but it don't work for a cent." </p>
                <p> "You call her Tom Grogan?" Babcock asked, with a certain tone in his voice. He
                    resented, somehow, Crane's familiarity. </p>
                <p> "Certainly. Everybody calls her Tom Grogan. It 's her husband's name. Call her
                    anything else, and she don't answer. She seems to glory in it, and after you
                    know her a while you don't want to call her anything else yourself. It comes
                    kind of natural--like your calling a man 'colonel' or 'judge.'" </p>
                <p> Babcock could not but admit that Crane might be right. All the names which could
                    apply to a woman who had been sweetheart, wife, and mother seemed out of place
                    when he thought of this undaunted spirit who had defied Lathers, and with one
                    blow of her fist sent the splinters of a fence flying about his head. </p>
                <p> "We 've got the year's contract for coal at the fort," continued Crane. "The
                    quarter-master-sergeant who inspects it--Sergeant Duffy--has a friend named
                    McGaw who wants to do the unloading into the government bins. There 's a low
                    price on the coal, and there 's no margin for anybody; and if <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0059" n="38"/> Duffy should kick about the quality of
                    the coal,--and you can't please these fellows if they want to be ugly,--Crane
                    &amp; Co. will be in a hole, and lose money on the contract. I hate to go
                    back on Tom Grogan, but there 's no help for it. The ten cents a ton I 'd save
                    if she hauls the coal instead of McGaw would be eaten up in Duffy's short
                    weights and rejections. I sent Sergeant Duffy's letter to her, so she can tell
                    how the land lies, and I 'm going up now to her house to see her, on my way to
                    the fort. I don't know what Duffy will get out of it; perhaps he gets a few
                    dollars out of the hauling. The coal is shipped, by the way, and ought to be
                    here any minute." </p>
                <p> "Wait; I 'll go with you," said Babcock, handing him an order for more coal.
                    "She has n't sent down the tally-sheet for my last scow." There was not the
                    slightest necessity, of course, for Babcock to go to Grogan's house for this
                    document. </p>
                <p> As they walked on, Crane talked of everything except what was uppermost in
                    Babcock's mind. Babcock tried to lead the conversation back to Tom, but Crane's
                    thoughts were on something else. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0060" n="39"/>

                <p> When they reached the top of the hill, the noble harbor lay spread out beneath
                    them, from the purple line of the great cities to the silver sheen of the sea
                    inside the narrows. The clearing wind had hauled to the northwest. The sky was
                    heaped with soft clouds floating in the blue. At the base of the hill nestled
                    the buildings and wharves of the Lighthouse Depot, with the unfinished sea-wall
                    running out from the shore, fringed with platforms and bristling with swinging
                    booms--the rings of white steam twirling from the exhaust-pipes. </p>
                <p> On either side of the vast basin lay two grim, silent forts, crouched on grassy
                    slopes like great beasts with claws concealed. Near by, big lazy steamers,
                    sullen and dull, rested motionless at Quarantine, awaiting inspection; while
                    beyond, white-winged graceful yachts curved tufts of foam from their bows. In
                    the open, elevators rose high as church steeples; long lines of canal-boats
                    stretched themselves out like huge water-snakes, with hissing tugs for heads;
                    enormous floats groaned under whole trains of cars; big, burly lighters drifted
                    slowly with widespread oil-stained sails; monster derricks towered <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0061" n="40"/> aloft, derricks that pick up a
                    hundred-ton gun as easily as an ant does a grain of sand--each floating craft
                    made necessary by some special industry peculiar to the port of New York, and
                    each unlike any other craft in the harbor of any other city of the world. </p>
                <p> Grogan's house and stables lay just over the brow of this hill, in a little
                    hollow. The house was a plain, square frame dwelling, with front and rear
                    verandas, protected by the arching branches of a big sycamore-tree, and
                    surrounded by a small garden filled with flaming dahlias and chrysanthemums.
                    Everything about the place was scrupulously neat and clean. </p>
                <p> The stables--there were two--stood on the lower end of the lot. They looked new,
                    or were newly painted in a dark red, and appeared to have accommodations for a
                    number of horses. The stable-yard lay below the house. In its open square were a
                    pump and a horse-trough, at which two horses were drinking. One, the Big Gray,
                    had his collar off, showing where the sweat had discolored the skin, the traces
                    crossed loosely over his back. He was drinking eagerly, and had evidently just
                    come in from work. About, <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0062" n="41"/> under the
                    sheds, were dirt-carts tilted forward on their shafts, and dust-begrimed
                    harnesses hanging on wooden pegs. </p>
                <p> A strapping young fellow in a red shirt came out of the stable door leading two
                    other horses to the trough. Babcock looked about him in surprise at the extent
                    of the establishment. He had supposed that his stevedore had a small outfit and
                    needed all the work she could get. If, as McGaw had said, only boys did Grogan's
                    work, they at least did it well. </p>
                <p> Crane mounted the porch first and knocked. Babcock followed. </p>
                <p> "No, Mr. Crane," said a young girl, opening the door, "she 's not at home. I 'm
                    expecting her every minute. Mother went to work early this morning. She 'll be
                    sorry to miss you, sir. She ought to be home now, for she 's been up 'most all
                    night at the fort. She 's just sent Carl up for two more horses. Won't you come
                    in and wait?" </p>
                <p> "No; I'll keep on to the fort," answered Crane. "I may meet her on the road." </p>
                <p> "May I come in?" Babcock asked, explaining his business in a few words. </p>
                <p> "Oh, yes, sir. Mother won't be long now. <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0063" n="42"
                    /> You 've not forgotten me, Mr. Babcock? I 'm her daughter Jennie. I was to
                    your office once. Gran'pop, this is the gentleman mother works for." </p>
                <p> An old man rose with some difficulty from an armchair, and bowed in a kindly,
                    deferential way. He had been reading near the window. He was in his
                    shirt-sleeves, his collar open at the throat. He seemed rather feeble. His legs
                    shook as if he were weak from some recent illness. About the eyes was a certain
                    kindliness that did not escape Babcock's quick glance; they were clear and
                    honest, and looked straight into his--the kind he liked. The old man's most
                    striking features were his silver-white hair, parted over his forehead and
                    falling to his shoulders, and his thin, straight, transparent nose, indicating
                    both ill health and a certain refinement and sensitiveness of nature. Had it not
                    been for his dress, he might have passed for an English curate on half pay. </p>
                <p> "Me name 's Richard, sor--Richard Mullins," said the old man. "I 'm Mary's
                    father. She won't be long gone now, She promised me she 'd be home for dinner."
                    He placed a chair for Babcock, and remained standing. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0064" n="43"/>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0065" n="44"/>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0066" n="45"/>

                <p> "I will wait until she returns," said Babcock. He had come to discover something
                    more definite about this woman who worked like a steam-engine, crooned over a
                    cripple, and broke a plank with her fist, and he did not intend to leave until
                    he knew. "Your daughter must have had great experience. I have never seen any
                    one man handle work better," he continued, extending his hand. Then, noticing
                    that Mullins was still standing, "Don't let me take your seat." </p>
                <p> Mullins hesitated, glanced at Jennie, and, moving another chair from the window,
                    drew it nearer, and settled slowly beside Babcock. </p>
                <p> The room was as clean as bare arms and scrubbing-brushes could make it. Near the
                    fireplace was a cast-iron stove, and opposite this stood a parlor organ, its top
                    littered with photographs. A few chromos hung on the walls. There were also a
                    big plush sofa and two haircloth rocking-chairs, of walnut, covered with cotton
                    tidies. The carpet on the floor was new, and in the window, where the old man
                    had been sitting, some pots of nasturtiums were blooming, their tendrils
                    reaching up both sides of the sash. Opening from this room was the kitchen,
                    resplendent <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0067" n="46"/> in bright pans and a
                    shining copper wash-boiler. The girl passed constantly in and out the open door,
                    spreading the cloth and bringing dishes for the table. </p>
                <p> Her girlish figure was clothed in a blue calico frock and white apron, the
                    sleeves rolled up to the elbows, showing some faint traces of flour clinging to
                    her wrists, as if she had been suddenly summoned from the bread-bowl. She was
                    fresh and sweet, strong and healthy, with a certain grace of manner about her
                    that pleased Babcock instantly. He saw now that she had her mother's eyes and
                    color, but not her air of fearlessness and self-reliance--that kind of
                    self-reliance which comes only of many nights of anxiety and many days of
                    success. He noticed, too, that when she spoke to the old man her voice was
                    tempered with a peculiar tenderness, as if his infirmities were more to be
                    pitied than complained of. This pleased him most of all. </p>
                <p> "You live with your daughter, Mrs. Grogan?" Babcock asked in a friendly way,
                    turning to the old man. </p>
                <p> "Yis, sor. Whin Tom got sick, she sint fer me to come over an' hilp her. I feeds
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0068" n="47"/>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0069" n="48"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0070" n="49"/> the horses whin Oi 'm able, an' looks
                    after the garden, but Oi 'm not much good." </p>
                <p> "Is Mr. Thomas Grogan living?" asked Babcock cautiously, and with a certain tone
                    of respect, hoping to get closer to the facts, and yet not to seem intrusive. </p>
                <p> "Oh, yis, sor: an' moight be dead fer all the good he does, He's in New Yorruk
                    some'er's, on a farm"--lowering his voice to a whisper and looking anxiously
                    toward Jennie--" belongin' to the State, I think, sor. He's hurted pretty bad,
                    an' p'haps he's a leetle off--I dunno. Mary has niver tould me." </p>
                <p> Before Babcock could pursue the inquiry further there was a firm tread on the
                    porch steps, and the old man rose from the chair, his face brightening. </p>
                <p> "Here she is, Gran'pop," said Jennie, laying down her dish and springing to the
                    door. </p>
                <p> "Hold tight, darlint," came a voice from the outside, and the next instant Tom
                    Grogan strode in, her face aglow with laughter, her hood awry, her eyes beaming.
                    Patsy was perched on her shoulder, his little crutch fast in one hand, the other
                    tightly wound about <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0071" n="50"/> her neck. "Let go,
                    darlint; ye're a-chokin' the wind out of me. </p>
                <p> "Oh, it 's ye a-waitin', Mr. Babcock--me man Carl thought ye 'd gone. Mr. Crane
                    I met outside told me you'd been here. Jennie 'll get the tally-sheet of the
                    last load for ye. I 've been to the fort since daylight, and pretty much all
                    night, to tell ye God's truth. Oh, Gran'pop, but I smashed 'em!" she exclaimed
                    as she gently removed Patsy's arm and laid him in the old man's lap. She had
                    picked the little cripple up at the garden gate, where he always waited for her.
                    "That 's the last job that sneakin' Duffy and Dan McGaw 'll ever put up on me.
                    Oh, but ye should 'a' minded the face on him, Gran'pop!"--untying her hood and
                    breaking into a laugh so contagious in its mirth that even Babcock joined in
                    without knowing what it was all about. </p>
                <p> As she spoke, Tom stood facing her father, hood and ulster off, the light of the
                    windows silhouetting the splendid lines of her well-rounded figure, with its
                    deep chest, firm bust, broad back, and full throat, her arms swinging loose and
                    free. </p>
                <p> "Ye see," she said, turning to Babcock, <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0072" n="51"
                    /> "that man Duffy tried to do me,--he 's the sergeant at the fort--and Dan
                    McGaw--ye know him--he 's the divil that wanted to work for ye. Ye know I always
                    had the hauling of the coal at the fort, an' I want to hold on to it, for it
                    comes every year. I 've been a-watchin' for this coal for a month. Every October
                    there 's a new contractor, and this time it was me friend Mr. Crane I've worked
                    for before. So I sees Duffy about it the other day, an' he says, 'Well, I think
                    ye better talk to the quartermaster, who 's away, but who'll be home next week.'
                    An' that night when I got home, there lay a letter from Mr. Crane, wid another
                    letter inside it Sergeant Duffy had sent to Mr. Crane, sayin' he'd recommend Dan
                    McGaw to do the stevedorin'--the sneakin' villain--an' sayin' that
                    he--Duffy--was a-goin' to inspect the coal himself, an' if his friend Dan McGaw
                    hauled it, the quality would be all right. Think of that! I tell ye, Mr.
                    Babcock, they 're divils. Then Mr. Crane put down at the bottom of his letter to
                    me that he was sorry not to give me the job, but that he must give it to Duffy's
                    friend McGaw, or Duffy might reject the coal. Wait till I wash <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0073" n="52"/> me hands and I 'll tell ye how I fixed
                    him," she added suddenly, as with a glance at her fingers she disappeared into
                    the kitchen, reappearing a moment later with her bare arms as fresh and as rosy
                    as her cheeks, from their friction with a clean crash towel. </p>
                <p> "Well!" she continued, "I jumps into me bonnet yisterday, and over I goes to the
                    fort; an' I up an' says to Duffy, 'I can't wait for the quartermaster. When's
                    that coal a-comin'?' An' he says, 'In a couple of weeks' An' I turned onto him
                    and says: 'Ye 're a pretty loafer to take the bread out of Tom Grogan's
                    children's mouths! An' ye want Dan McGaw to do the haulin', do ye? An' the
                    quality of the coal 'll be all right if he gits it! An' there 's sure to be
                    twenty-five dollars for ye, won't there? If I hear a word more out of ye I 'll
                    see Colonel Howard sure, an' hand him this letter.' An' Duffy turned white as a
                    load of lime, and says, 'Don't do it, for God's sake! It 'll cost me m' place.'
                    While I was a-talkin' I see a chunker-boat with the very coal on it round into
                    the dock with a tug; an' I ran to the string-piece and catched the line, and has
                    her fast to a spile before the tug lost head-way. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0074" n="53"/>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0075" n="54"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0076" n="55"/> Then I started for home on the run, to
                    get me derricks and stuff. I got home, hooked up by twelve o'clock last night,
                    an' before daylight I had me rig up an' the fall set and the buckets over her
                    hatches. At six o'clock this mornin' I took the teams and was a-runnin' the coal
                    out of the chunker, when down comes Mr.--Daniel--McGaw with a gang and his big
                    derrick on a cart." She repeated this in a mocking tone, swinging her big
                    shoulders exactly as her rival would have done." </p>
                <p> "'That 's me rig,' I says to him, p'intin' up to the gaff, 'an' me coal, an' I
                    'll throw the fust man overboard who lays hands on it!' An' then the sergeant
                    come out and took McGaw one side an' said somethin' to him, with his back to me;
                    an' when McGaw turned he was white too, an' without sayin' a word he turned the
                    team and druv off. An' just now I met Mr. Crane walkin' down, lookin' like he
                    had lost a horse. 'Tom Grogan,' he says, 'I hate to disappoint ye, an' would
                    n't, for ye 've always done me work well; but I 'm stuck on the coal contract,
                    an' the sergeant can put me in a hole if ye do the haulin'.' An' I says, 'Brace
                    up, Mr. Crane, there 's a hole, but ye ain't in it, an' <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0077" n="56"/> the sergeant is. I 'll unload every
                    pound of that coal, if I do it for nothin', and if that sneak in striped
                    trousers bothers me or you, I 'll pull him apart an' stamp on him!'" </p>
                <p> Through all her talk there was a triumphant good humor, a joyousness, a glow and
                    breeziness, which completely fascinated Babcock. Although she had been up half
                    the night, she was as sweet and fresh and rosy as a child. Her vitality, her
                    strength, her indomitable energy, impressed him as no woman's had ever done
                    before. </p>
                <p> When she had finished her story she suddenly caught Patsy out of her father's
                    arms and dropped with him into a chair, all the mother-hunger in her still
                    unsatisfied. She smothered him with kisses and hugged him to her breast, holding
                    his pinched face against her ruddy cheek. Then she smoothed his forehead with
                    her well-shaped hand, and rocked him back and forth. By and by she told him of
                    the stone that the Big Gray had got in his hoof down at the fort that morning,
                    and how lame he had been, and how Cully had taken it out
                    with--a--great--big--spike!--dwelling on the last words as if they belonged to
                    some wonderful fairy-tale. <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0078" n="57"/> The little
                    fellow sat up in her lap and laughed as he patted her breast joyously with his
                    thin hand. "Cully could do it," he shouted in high glee; "Cully can do
                    anything." Babcock, apparently, made no more difference to her than if he had
                    been an extra chair. </p>
                <p> As she moved about her rooms afterward, calling to her men from the open door,
                    consulting with Jennie, her arms about her neck, or stopping at intervals to
                    croon over her child, she seemed to him to lose all identity with the woman on
                    the dock. The spirit that enveloped her belonged rather to that of some royal
                    dame of heroic times, than to that of a working woman of to-day. The room
                    somehow became her castle, the rough stablemen her knights. </p>
                <p> On his return to his work she walked back with him part of the way. Babcock,
                    still bewildered, and still consumed with curiosity to learn something of her
                    past, led the talk to her life along the docks, expressing his great surprise at
                    discovering her so capable and willing to do a man's work, asking who had taught
                    her, and whether her husband in his time had been equally efficient and strong. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0079" n="58"/>

                <p> Instantly she grew reticent. She did not even answer his question. He waited a
                    moment, and, realizing his mistake, turned the conversation in another
                    direction. </p>
                <p> "And how about those rough fellows around the wharves--those who don't know
                    you--are they never coarse and brutal to you?" </p>
                <p> "Not when I look 'em in the face," she answered slowly and deliberately. "No man
                    ever opens his head, nor dar's n't. When they see me a-comin' they stops
                    talkin', if it 's what they would n't want their daughters to hear; an' there
                    ain't no dirty back talk, neither. An' I make me own men civil, too, with a
                    dacint tongue in their heads. I had a young strip of a lad once who would be
                    a-swearin' round the stables. I told him to mend his manners or I 'd wash his
                    mouth out, an' that I would n't have nobody hit me horses on the head. He kep'
                    along, an' I see it was a bad example for the other drivers (this was only a
                    year ago, an' I had three of 'em); so when he hit the Big Gray ag'in, I hauled
                    off and give him a crack that laid him out. I was scared solid for two hours,
                    though they never knew it." </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0080" n="59"/>

                <p> Then, with an almost piteous look in her face, and with a sudden burst of
                    confidence, born, doubtless, of a dawning faith in the man's evident sincerity
                    and esteem, she said in a faltering tone:-- </p>
                <p> "God help me! what can I do? I've no man to stand by me, an' somebody 's got to
                    be boss." </p>

                <head>IV<lb/> A WALKING DELEGATE LEARNS A NEW STEP</head>
                <p> McGAW'S failure to undermine Tom's business with Babcock, and his complete
                    discomfiture over Crane's coal contract at the fort, only intensified his hatred
                    of the woman. </p>
                <p> Finding that he could make no headway against her alone, he called upon the
                    Union to assist him, claiming that she was employing non-union labor, and had
                    thus been able to cut down the discharging rates to starvation prices. </p>
                <p> A meeting was accordingly called by the executive committee of the Knights, and
                    a resolution passed condemning certain persons in the village of Rockville as
                    traitors to the cause of the workingman. Only one copy of this edict was issued
                    and mailed. This found its way into Tom Grogan's letter-box. Five minutes after
                    she had broken the seal, her <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0082" n="61"/> men
                    discovered the document pasted upside down on her stable door. </p>
                <p> McGaw heard of her action that night, and started another line of attack. It was
                    managed so skillfully that that which until then had been only a general
                    dissatisfaction on the part of the members of the Union and their sympathizers
                    over Tom's business methods now developed into an avowed determination to crush
                    her. They discussed several plans by which she could be compelled either to
                    restore rates for unloading, or be forced out of the business altogether. As one
                    result of these deliberations a committee called upon the priest, Father
                    McCluskey, and informed him of the delicate position in which the Union had been
                    placed by her having hidden her husband away, thus forcing them to fight the
                    woman herself. She was making trouble, they urged, with her low wages and her
                    unloading rates. "Perhaps his Riverence c'u'd straighten her out." Father
                    McCluskey's interview with Tom took place in the priest's room one morning after
                    early mass. It had gone abroad, somehow, that his Reverence intended to
                    discipline the "high-flyer," and a considerable <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0083"
                        n="62"/> number of the "tenement-house gang," as Tom called them, had
                    loitered behind to watch the effect of the good father's remonstrances. </p>
                <p> What Tom told the priest no one ever knew: such conferences are part of the
                    regime of the church, and go no farther. It was noticed, however, as she came
                    down the aisle, that her eyes were red, as if from weeping, and that she never
                    raised them from the floor as she passed between her enemies on her way to the
                    church door. Once outside, she put her arm around Jennie, who was waiting, and
                    the two strolled slowly across the lots to her house. </p>
                <p> When the priest came out, his own eyes were tinged with moisture. He called
                    Dennis Quigg, McGaw's right-hand man, and in a voice loud enough to be heard by
                    those nearest him expressed his indignation that any dissension should have
                    arisen among his people over a woman's work, and said that he would hear no more
                    of this unchristian and unmanly interference with one whose only support came
                    from the labor of her hands. </p>
                <p> McGaw and his friends were not discouraged. They were only determined upon some
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0084" n="63"/> more definite stroke. It was
                    therefore ordered that a committee be appointed to waylay her men going to work,
                    and inform them of their duty to their fellow-laborers. </p>
                <p> Accordingly, this same Quigg--smooth-shaven, smirking, and hollow-eyed, with a
                    diamond pin, half a yard of watch-chain, and a fancy shirt--ex-village clerk
                    with his accounts short, ex-deputy sheriff with his accounts of cruelty and
                    blackmail long, and at present walking delegate of the Union--was appointed a
                    committee of one for that duty. </p>
                <p> Quigg began by begging a ride in one of Tom's return carts, and taking this
                    opportunity to lay before the driver the enormity of working for Grogan for
                    thirty dollars a month and board, when there were a number of his brethren out
                    of work and starving who would not work for less than two dollars a day if it
                    were offered them. It was plainly the driver's duty, Quigg urged, to give up his
                    job until Tom Grogan could be compelled to hire him back at advanced wages.
                    During this enforced idleness the Union would pay the driver fifty cents a day.
                    Here Quigg pounded his chest, clenched his fists, and <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0085" n="64"/> said solemnly, "If capital once downs
                    the lab'rin' man, we 'll all be slaves," </p>
                <p> The driver was Carl Nilsson, a Swede, a big, blue-eyed, light-haired young
                    fellow of twenty-two, a sailor from boyhood, who three years before, on a public
                    highway, had been picked up penniless and hungry by Tom Grogan, after the keeper
                    of a sailors' boarding-house had robbed him of his year's savings. The change
                    from cracking ice from a ship's deck with a marlinespike, to currying and
                    feeding something alive and warm and comfortable, was so delightful to the Swede
                    that he had given up the sea for a while. He had felt that he could ship again
                    at anytime, the water was so near. As the months went by, however, he, too,
                    gradually fell under the spell of Tom's influence. She reminded him of the great
                    Norse women he had read about in his boyhood. Besides all this, he was loyal and
                    true to the woman who had befriended him, and who had so far appreciated his
                    devotion to her interests as to promote him from hostler and driver to foreman
                    of the stables. </p>
                <p> Nilsson knew Quigg by sight, for he had seen him walking home with Jennie from
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0086" n="65"/>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0087" n="66"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0088" n="67"/> church. His knowledge of English was
                    slight, but it was enough to enable him to comprehend Quigg's purpose as he
                    talked beside him on the cart. After some questions about how long the enforced
                    idleness would continue, he asked suddenly:-- </p>
                <p> "Who da horse clean when I go 'way?" </p>
                <p> "D--n her! let her clean it herself," Quigg answered angrily. </p>
                <p> This ended the question for Nilsson, and it very nearly ended the delegate.
                    Jumping from the cart, Carl picked up the shovel and sprang toward Quigg, who
                    dodged out of his way, and then took to his heels. </p>
                <p> When Nilsson, still white with anger, reached the dock, he related the incident
                    to Cully, who, on his return home, retailed it to Jennie with such variety of
                    gesture and intonation that that young lady blushed scarlet, but whether from
                    sympathy for Quigg or admiration for Nilsson, Cully was unable to decide. </p>
                <p> Quigg's failure to coax away one of Tom's men ended active operations against
                    Tom, so far as the Union was concerned. It continued to listen to McGaw's
                    protests, but, with an eye open for its own interests, replied <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0089" n="68"/> that if Grogan's men would not be
                    enticed away it could at present take no further action. His trouble with Tom
                    was an individual matter, and a little patience on McGaw's part was advised. The
                    season's work was over, and nothing of importance could be done until the
                    opening of the spring business. If Tom's men struck now, she would be glad to
                    get rid of them. It would, therefore, be wiser to wait until she could not do
                    without them, when they might all be forced out in a body. In the interim McGaw
                    should direct his efforts to harassing his enemy. Perhaps a word with Slattery,
                    the blacksmith, might induce that worthy brother Knight to refuse to do her
                    shoeing some morning when she was stalled for want of a horse; or he might let a
                    nail slip in a tender hoof. No one could tell what might happen in the coming
                    months. At the moment the funds of the Union were too low for aggressive
                    measures. Were McGaw, however, to make a contribution of two hundred dollars to
                    the bank account in order to meet possible emergencies, something might be done.
                    All this was duly inscribed in the books of the committee,--that is, the last
                    part of it,--and upon <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0090" n="69"/> McGaw's
                    promising to do what he could toward improving the funds. It was thereupon
                    subsequently resolved that before resorting to harsher measures the Union should
                    do all in its power toward winning over the enemy. Brother Knight Dennis Quigg
                    was thereupon deputed to call upon Mrs. Grogan and invite her into the Union. </p>
                <p> On brother Knight Dennis Quigg's declining for private reasons the honorable
                    mission intrusted to him by the honorable board (Mr. Quigg's exact words of
                    refusal, whispered in the chairman's ear, were, "I 'm a-jollyin' one of her
                    kittens; send somebody else after the old cat"), another walking delegate,
                    brother Knight Crimmins by name, was selected to carry out the gracious action
                    of the committee. </p>
                <p> Crimmins had begun life as a plumber's helper, had been iceman, night-watchman,
                    heeler, and full-fledged plumber; and having been out of work himself for months
                    at a time, was admirably qualified to speak of the advantages of idleness to any
                    other candidate for like honors. </p>
                <p> He was a small man with a big nose, grizzled chin-whiskers, and rum-and-watery
                    eyes, <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0091" n="70"/> and wore constantly a pair of
                    patched blue overalls as a badge of his laborship. The seat of these outside
                    trousers showed more wear than his hands. </p>
                <p> Immediately upon his appointment, Crimmins went to McGaw's house to talk over
                    the line of attack. The conference was held in the sitting-room and behind
                    closed doors--so tightly closed that young Billy McGaw, with one eye in mourning
                    from the effect of a recent street fight, was unable, even by the aid of the
                    undamaged eye and the keyhole, to get the slightest inkling of what was going on
                    inside. </p>
                <p> When the door was finally opened and McGaw and Crimmins came out, they brought
                    with them an aroma the pungency of which was explained by two empty glasses and
                    a black bottle decorating one end of the only table in the room. </p>
                <p> As Crimmins stepped down from the broken stoop, with its rusty rain-spout and
                    rotting floor-planks, Billy overheard this parting remark from his father: "Thry
                    the ile furst, Crimmy, an' see what she 'll do; thin give her the vinegar; and
                    thin," with an oath, "ef that don't fetch 'er, come back <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0092" n="71"/> here to me and we 'll give 'er the red
                    pepper." </p>
                <p> Brother Knight Crimmins waved his hand to the speaker. "Just leave 'er to me,
                    Dan," he said, and started for Tom's house. Crimmins was delighted with his
                    mission. He felt sure of bringing back her application within an hour. Nothing
                    ever pleased him so much as to work a poor woman into an agony of fright with
                    threats of the Union. Wives and daughters had often followed him out into the
                    street, begging him to let the men alone for another week until they could pay
                    the rent. Sometimes, when he relented, the more grateful would bless him for his
                    magnanimity. This increased his self-respect. </p>
                <p> Tom met him at the door. She had been sitting up with a sick child of Dick Todd,
                    foreman at the brewery, and had just come home. Hardly a week passed without
                    some one in distress sending for her. She had never seen Crimmins before, and
                    thought he had come to mend the roof. His first words, however, betrayed him:-- </p>
                <p> "The Knights sent me up to have a word wid ye." </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0093" n="72"/>

                <p> Tom made a movement as if to shut the door in his face; then she paused for an
                    instant, and said curtly, "Come inside." </p>
                <p> Crimmins crushed his slouch-hat in his hand, and slunk into a chair by the
                    window. Tom remained standing. </p>
                <p> "I see ye like flowers, Mrs. Grogan," he began, in his gentlest voice. "Them
                    geraniums is the finest I iver see"--peering under the leaves of the plants.
                    "Guess it 's 'cause ye water 'em so much." </p>
                <p> Tom made no reply. </p>
                <p> Crimmins fidgeted on his chair a little, and tried another tack. "I s'pose ye
                    ain't doin' much just now, weather 's so bad. The road 's awful goin' down to
                    the fort." </p>
                <p> Tom's hands were in the side pockets of her ulster. Her face was aglow with her
                    brisk walk from the tenements. She never took her eyes from his face, and never
                    moved a muscle of her body. She was slowly revolving in her mind whether any
                    information she could get out of him would be worth the waiting for. </p>
                <p> Crimmins relapsed into silence, and began patting the floor with his foot. The
                    prolonged stillness was becoming uncomfortable. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0094" n="73"/>

                <p> "I was tellin' ye about the meetin' we had to the Union last night. We was goin'
                    over the list of members, an' we did n't find yer name. The board thought maybe
                    ye 'd like to come in wid us. The dues is only two dollars a month. We 're
                    a-regulatin' the prices for next year, stevedorin' an' haulin', an' the rates
                    'll be sent out next week." The stopper was now out of the oil-bottle. </p>
                <p> "How many members have ye got?" she asked quietly. </p>
                <p> "Hundred an' seventy-three in our branch of the Knights." </p>
                <p> "All pay two dollars a month?" </p>
                <p> "That's about the size of it," said Crimmins. </p>
                <p> "What do we git when we jine?" </p>
                <p> "Well, we all pull together--that 's one thing. One man's strike 's every man's
                    strike. The capitalists been tryin' to down us, an' the laborin'-man 's got to
                    stand together. Did ye hear about the Fertilizer Company 's layin' off two of
                    our men las' Friday just fer bein' off a day or so without leave, and their
                    gittin' a couple of scabs from Hoboken to"-- </p>
                <p> "What else do we git?" said Tom, in a <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0095" n="74"/>
                    quick, imperious tone, ignoring the digression. She had moved a step closer. </p>
                <p> Crimmins looked slyly up into her eyes. Until this moment he had been addressing
                    his remarks to the brass ornament on the extreme top of the cast-iron stove.
                    Tom's expression of face did not reassure him; in fact, the steady gaze of her
                    clear gray eye was as uncomfortable as the focused light of a sun lens. </p>
                <p> "Well--we help each other," he blurted out. </p>
                <p> "Do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> do any helpin'?" </p>
                <p> "Yis;" stiffening a little. "I 'm the walkin' delegate of our branch." </p>
                <p> "Oh, ye 're the walkin' delegate! <hi rend="italic">You</hi> don't pay no two
                    dollars, then, do ye!" </p>
                <p> "No. There 's got to be somebody a-goin' round all the time, an' Dinnis Quigg
                    and me 's confidential agents of the branch, an' <hi rend="italic">what we says
                        goes</hi>"--slapping his overalls decisively with his fist. McGaw's
                    suggested stopper was being loosened on the vinegar. </p>
                <p> Tom's fingers closed tightly. Her collar began to feel small. "An' I s'pose if
                    ye said I should pay me men double wages, and put up the price o' haulin' so
                    high that me customers <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0096" n="75"/> could n't pay
                    it, so that some of yer dirty loafers could cut in an' git it, I 'd have to do
                    it, whether I wanted to or not; or maybe ye think I 'd oughter chuck some o' me
                    own boys into the road because they don't belong to yer branch, as ye call it,
                    and git a lot o' dead beats to work in their places who don't know a horse from
                    a coal-bucket. An' ye 'll help me, will ye? Come out here on the front porch,
                    Mr. Crimmins"--opening the door with a jerk. "Do ye see that stable over there!
                    Well, it covers seven horses; an' the shed has six carts with all the harness.
                    Back of it--perhaps if ye stand on yer toes even a little feller like you can
                    see the top of another shed. That one has me derricks an' tools." </p>
                <p> Crimmins tried to interrupt long enough to free McGaw's red pepper, but her
                    words poured out in a torrent. </p>
                <p> "Now ye can go back an' tell Dan McGaw an' the balance of yer two-dollar loafers
                    that there ain't a dollar owin' on any horse in my stable, an' that I 've earned
                    everything I 've got without a man round to help 'cept those I pays wages to.
                    An' ye can tell 'em, too, that I 'll hire who I please, an' pay 'em what they
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0097" n="76"/> oughter git; an' I 'll do me own
                    haulin' an' unloadin' fer nothin' if it suits me. When ye said ye were a walkin'
                    delegate ye spoke God's truth. Ye 'd be a ridin' delegate if ye could; but there
                    's one thing ye 'll niver be, an' that 's a workin' delegate, as long as ye kin
                    find fools to pay ye wages fer bummin' round day 'n' night. If I had me way, ye
                        <hi rend="italic">would</hi> walk, but it would be on yer uppers, wid yer
                    bare feet to the road." </p>
                <p> Crimmins again attempted to speak, but she raised her arm threateningly: "Now,
                    if it 's walkin' ye are, ye can begin right away. Let me see ye earn yer wages
                    down that garden an' into the road. Come, lively now, before I disgrace meself
                    a-layin' hands on the likes of ye!" </p>

                <head>V<lb/> A WORD FROM THE TENEMENTS</head>
                <p> ONE morning Patsy came up the garden path limping on his crutch; the little
                    fellow's eyes were full of tears. He had been out with his goat when some
                    children from the tenements surrounded his cart, pitched it into the ditch, and
                    followed him half way home, calling "Scab! scab!" at the top of their voices.
                    Cully heard his cries, and ran through the yard to meet him, his anger rising at
                    every step. To lay hands on Patsy was, to Cully, the unpardonable sin. Ever
                    since the day, five years before, when Tom had taken him into her employ, a
                    homeless waif of the streets,--his father had been drowned from a canal-boat she
                    was unloading,--and had set him down beside Patsy's crib to watch while she was
                    at her work, Jennie being at school, Cully had loved the little cripple with the
                    devotion of a dog to its master. <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0099" n="78"/>
                    Lawless, rough, often cruel, and sometimes vindictive as Cully was to others, a
                    word from Patsy humbled and softened him. </p>
                <p> And Patsy loved Cully. His big, broad chest, stout, straight legs, strong arms
                    and hands, were his admiration and constant pride. Cully was his champion and
                    his ideal. The waif's recklessness and audacity were to him only evidences of so
                    much brains and energy. </p>
                <p> This love between the lads grew stronger after Tom had sent to Dublin for her
                    old father, that she might have "a man about the house." Then a new blessing
                    came, not only into the lives of both the lads, but into the whole household as
                    well. Mullins, in his later years, had been a dependent about Trinity College,
                    and constant association with books and students had given him a taste for
                    knowledge denied his daughter. Tom had left home when a girl. In the long winter
                    nights during the slack season, after the stalls were bedded and the horses were
                    fed and watered and locked up for the night, the old man would draw up his chair
                    to the big kerosene lamp on the table, and tell the boys stories--they listening
                    with wide-open <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0100" n="79"/> eyes, Cully
                    interrupting the narrative every now and then by such asides as "No flies on
                    them fellers, wuz ther', Patsy? They wuz daisies, they wuz. Go on, Pop; it 's
                    bet-ter 'n a circus;" while Patsy would cheer aloud at the downfall of the
                    vanquished, with their "three thousand lance-bearers put to death by the sword,"
                    waving his crutch over his head in his enthusiasm. </p>
                <p> Jennie would come in too, and sit by her mother; and after Nilsson's encounter
                    with Quigg--an incident which greatly advanced him in Tom's estimation--Cully
                    would be sent to bring him in from his room over the stable and give him a chair
                    with the others, that he might learn the language easier. At these times it was
                    delightful to watch the expression of pride and happiness that would come over
                    Tom's face as she listened to her father's talk. </p>
                <p> "But ye have a great head, Gran'pop," she would say. "Cully, ye blatherin'
                    idiot, why don't ye brace up an' git some knowledge in yer head? Sure, Gran'pop,
                    Father McCluskey ain't in it wid ye a minute. Ye could down the whole gang of
                    'em." And the old man would smile faintly and say he had <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0101" n="80"/> heard the young gentlemen at the
                    college recite the stories so many times he could never forget them. </p>
                <p> In this way the boys grew closer together, Patsy cramming himself from books
                    during the day in order to tell Cully at night all about the Forty Thieves
                    boiled in oil, or Ali Baba and his donkey, or poor man Friday to whom Robinson
                    Crusoe was so kind; and Cully relating in return how Jimmie Finn smashed Pat
                    Gilsey's face because he threw stones at his sister, ending with a full account
                    of a dog-fight which a "snoozer of a cop" stopped with his club. </p>
                <p> So when Patsy came limping up the garden path this morning, rubbing his eyes,
                    his voice choking, and the tears streaming, and, burying his little face in
                    Cully's jacket, poured out his tale of insult and suffering, that valiant
                    defender of the right pulled his cap tight over his eyes and began a still-hunt
                    through the tenements. There, as he afterwards expressed it, he "mopped up the
                    floor" with one after another of the ringleaders, beginning with young Billy
                    McGaw, Dan's eldest son and Cully's senior. </p>
                <p> Tom was dumfounded at the attack on <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0102" n="81"/>
                    Patsy. This was a blow upon which she had not counted. To strike her Patsy, her
                    cripple, her baby! The cowardice of it incensed her, She knew instantly that her
                    affairs must have been common talk about the tenements to have produced so great
                    an effect upon the children. She felt sure that their fathers and mothers had
                    encouraged them in it. </p>
                <p> In emergencies like this it was never to the old father that she turned, He was
                    too feeble, too much a thing of the past. While to a certain extent he
                    influenced her life, standing always for the right and always for the kindest
                    thing she could do, yet when it came to times of action and danger she felt the
                    need of a younger and more vigorous mind. It was on Jennie, really more her
                    companion than her daughter, that she depended for counsel and sympathy at these
                    times. </p>
                <p> Tom did not underestimate the gravity of the situation. Up to that point in her
                    career she had fought only the cold, the heat, the many weary hours of labor far
                    into the night, and now and then some man like McGaw. But this stab from out the
                    dark was a danger <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0103" n="82"/> to which she was
                    unused. She saw in this last move of McGaw's, aided as he was by the Union, not
                    only a determination to ruin her, but a plan to divide her business among a set
                    of men who hated her as much on account of her success as for anything else. A
                    few more horses and carts and another barn or two, and she herself would become
                    a hated capitalist. That she had stood out in the wet and cold herself, hours at
                    a time, like any man among them; that she had, in her husband's early days,
                    helped him feed and bed their one horse, often currying him herself; that when
                    she and her Tom had moved to Rockville with their savings and there were three
                    horses to care for and her husband needed more help than he could hire, she had
                    brought her little baby Patsy to the stable while she worked there like a man;
                    that during all this time she had cooked and washed and kept the house tidy for
                    four people; that she had done all these things she felt would not count now
                    with the Union, though each member of it was a bread-winner like herself. </p>
                <p> She knew what power it wielded. There had been the Martin family, honest,
                    hardworking people, who had come down from <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0104"
                        n="83"/> Haverstraw--the man and wife and their three children--and moved
                    into the new tenement with all their nice furniture and new carpets. Tom had
                    helped them unload these things from the brick-sloop that brought them. A few
                    weeks after, poor Martin, still almost a stranger, had been brought home from
                    the gas-house with his head laid open, because he had taken the place of a Union
                    man discharged for drunkenness, and lingered for weeks until he died. Then the
                    widow, with her children about her, had been put aboard another sloop that was
                    going back to her old home. Tom remembered, as if it were yesterday, the heap of
                    furniture and little pile of kitchen things sold under the red flag outside the
                    store near the post-office. </p>
                <p> She had seen, too, the suffering and misery of her neighbors during the long
                    strike at the brewery two years before, and the moving in and out from house to
                    tenement and tenement to shanty, with never a day's work afterward for any man
                    who left his job. She had helped many of the men who, three years before, had
                    been driven out of work by the majority vote of the Carpenters' Union, and who
                    dared not go back and face the terrible <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0105" n="84"
                    /> excommunication, the social boycott, with all its insults and cruelties. She
                    shuddered as she thought again of her suspicions years ago when the bucket had
                    fallen that crushed in her husband's chest, and sent him to bed for months, only
                    to leave it a wrecked man. The rope that held the bucket had been burned by
                    acid, Dr. Mason said. Some grudge of the Union, she had always felt, was paid
                    off then. </p>
                <p> She knew what the present trouble meant, now that it was started, and she knew
                    in what it might end. But her courage never wavered. She ran over in her mind
                    the names of the several men who were fighting her--McGaw, for whom she had a
                    contempt; Dempsey and Jimmie Brown, of the executive committee, both
                    liquor-dealers; Paterson, foreman of the gas-house; and the rest--dangerous
                    enemies, she knew. </p>
                <p> That night she sent for Nilsson to come to the house; heard from him, word for
                    word, of Quigg's effort to corrupt him; questioned Patsy closely, getting the
                    names of the children who had abused him; then calling Jennie into her bedroom,
                    she locked the door behind them. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0106" n="85"/>

                <p> When they reentered the sitting-room, an hour later, Jennie's lips were
                    quivering. Tom's mouth was firmly set. Her mind was made up. </p>
                <p> She would fight it out to the bitter end. </p>

                    to say, dominate all the members of her own household. One defied her. This was
                    no other than that despoiler of new-washed clothes, old harness, wagon-grease,
                    time-books, and spring flowers, that Arab of the open lot, Stumpy the goat. </p>
                <p> This supremacy of the goat had lasted since the eventful morning when, only a
                    kid of tender days, he had come into the stable-yard and wobbled about on his
                    uncertain legs, nestling down near the door where Patsy lay. During all these
                    years he had ruled over Tom. At first because his fuzzy white back and soft,
                    silky legs had been so precious to the little cripple, and later because of his
                    inexhaustible energy, his aggressiveness, <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0108"
                        n="87"/> and his marvelous activity. Brave spirits have fainted at the sight
                    of spiders, others have turned pale at lizards, and some have shivered when cats
                    crossed their paths. The only thing Tom feared on any number of legs, from
                    centipedes to men, was Stumpy. </p>
                <p> "Git out, ye imp of Satan!" she would say, raising her hand when he wandered too
                    near; "or I 'll smash ye!" The next instant she would be dodging behind the cart
                    out of the way of Stumpy's lowered horns, with a scream as natural and as
                    uncontrollable as that of a schoolgirl over a mouse. When he stood in the path
                    cleared of snow from house to stable door, with head down, prepared to dispute
                    every inch of the way with her, she would tramp yards around him, up to her
                    knees in the drift, rather than face his obstinate front. </p>
                <p> The basest of ingratitude actuated the goat. When the accident occurred that
                    gained him his sobriquet and lost him his tail, it was Tom's quickness of hand
                    alone that saved the remainder of his kidship from disappearing as his tail had
                    done. Indeed, she not only choked the dog who attacked <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0109" n="88"/> him, until he loosened his hold from
                    want of breath, but she threw him over the stable-yard fence as an additional
                    mark of her displeasure. </p>
                <p> In spite of her fear of him, Tom never dispossessed Stumpy. That her Patsy loved
                    him insured him his place for life. </p>
                <p> So Stumpy roamed through yard, kitchen, and stable, stalking over bleaching
                    sheets, burglarizing the garden gate, and grazing wherever he chose. </p>
                <p> The goat inspired no fear in anybody else. Jennie would chase him out of her way
                    a dozen times a day, and Cully would play bullfight with him, and Carl and the
                    other men would accord him his proper place, spanking him with the flat of a
                    shovel whenever he interfered with their daily duties, or shying a corn-cob
                    after him when his alertness carried him out of their reach. </p>
                <p> This afternoon Jennie had missed her blue-checked apron. It had been drying on
                    the line outside the kitchen door five minutes before. There was no one at home
                    but herself, and she had seen nobody pass the door. Perhaps the apron had blown
                    over into the stable-yard. If it had, Carl would be sure <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0110" n="89"/> to have seen it. She knew Carl had
                    come home; she had been watching for him through the window. Then she ran in for
                    her shawl. </p>
                <p> Carl was rubbing down the Big Gray. He had been hauling ice all the morning for
                    the brewery. The Gray was under the cart-shed, a flood of winter sunlight
                    silvering his shaggy mane and restless ears. The Swede was scraping his sides
                    with the currycomb, and the Big Gray, accustomed to Cully's gentler touch, was
                    resenting the familiarity by biting at the tippet wound about the neck of the
                    young man. </p>
                <p> Suddenly Carl raised his head--he had caught a glimpse of a flying apron
                    whipping round the stable door. He knew the pattern. It always gave him a lump
                    in his throat, and some little creepings down his back when he saw it. Then he
                    laid down the currycomb. The next instant there came a sound as of a barrel-head
                    knocked in by a mixing-shovel, and Stumpy flew through the door, followed by
                    Carl on the run. The familiar bit of calico was Jennie's lost apron. One half
                    was inside the goat, the other half was in the hand of the Swede. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0111" n="90"/>

                <p> Carl hesitated for a moment, looked cautiously about the yard, and walked slowly
                    toward the house, his eyes on the fragments. He never went to the house except
                    when he was invited, either to hear Pop read or to take his dinner with the
                    other men. At this instant Jennie came running out, the shawl about her head. </p>
                <p> "Oh, Carl, did you find my apron? It blew away, and I thought it might have gone
                    into the yard." </p>
                <p> "Yas, mees; an' da goat see it too--luke!" extending the tattered fragments,
                    anger and sorrow struggling for the mastery in his face. </p>
                <p> "Well, I never! Carl, it was a bran'-new one. Now just see, all the strings torn
                    off and the top gone! I 'm just going to give Stumpy a good beating." </p>
                <p> Carl suggested that he run after the goat and bring him back; but Jennie thought
                    he was down the road by this time, and Carl had been working all the morning and
                    must be tired. Besides, she must get some wood. </p>
                <p> Carl instantly forgot the goat. He had forgotten everything, indeed, except the
                    trim little body who stood before him looking into <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0112" n="91" />
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0113" n="92"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0114" n="93"/> his eyes. He glowed all over with
                    inward warmth and delight. Nobody had ever cared before whether he was tired.
                    When he was a little fellow at home at Memlo his mother would sometimes worry
                    about his lifting the big baskets of fish all day, but he could not remember
                    that anybody else had ever given his feelings a thought. All this flashed
                    through his mind as he returned Jennie's look. </p>
                <p> "No, no! I not tire--I brang da wood." And then Jennie said she never meant it,
                    and Carl knew she did n't, of course; and then she said she had never thought of
                    such a thing, and he agreed to that; and they talked so long over it, standing
                    out in the radiance of the noonday sun, the color coming and going in both their
                    faces,--Carl playing aimlessly with his tippet tassel, and Jennie plaiting and
                    pinching up the ruined apron,--that the fire in the kitchen stove went out, and
                    the Big Gray grew hungry and craned his long neck around the shed and whinnied
                    for Carl, and even Stumpy the goat forgot his hair--breadth escape, and returned
                    near enough to the scene of the robbery to look down at it from the hill above. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0115" n="94"/>

                <p> There is no telling how long the Big Gray would have waited if Cully had not
                    come home to dinner, bringing another horse with Patsy perched on his back. The
                    brewery was only a short distance, and Tom always gave her men a hot meal at the
                    house whenever it was possible. Had any other horse been neglected, Cully would
                    not have cared; but the Big Gray which he had driven ever since the day Tom
                    brought him home,--"Old Blowhard," as he would often call him (the Gray was a
                    bit wheezy),--the Big Gray without his dinner! </p>
                <p> "Hully gee! Look at de bloke a-jollying Jinnie, an' de Blowhard a-starvin'. Say,
                    Patsy,"--lifting him down,--"hold de line till I git de Big Gray a bite. Git on
                    ter Carl, will ye! I 'm a-goin'--ter--tell--de--boss,"--with a threatening air,
                    weighing each word--"jes soon as she gits back. Ef I don't I 'm a chump." </p>
                <p> At sight of the boys, Jennie darted into the house, and Carl started for the
                    stable, his head in the clouds, his feet on air. </p>
                <p> "No; I feed da horse, Cully,"--jerking at his halter to get him away from Cully. </p>
                <p> "A hell ov'er lot ye will! I 'll feed him <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0116"
                        n="95"/> meself. He 's been home an hour now, an' he ain't half rubbed
                    down." </p>
                <p> Carl made a grab for Cully, who dodged and ran under the cart. Then a lump of
                    ice whizzed past Carl's ear. </p>
                <p> "Here, stop that!" said Tom, entering the gate. She had been in the city all the
                    morning--" to look after her poor Tom," Pop said. "Don't ye be throwing things
                    round here, or I 'll land on top of ye." </p>
                <p> "Well, why don't he feed de Gray, den? He started afore me, and dey wants de
                    Gray down ter de brewery, and he up ter de house a-buzzin' Jinnie." </p>
                <p> "I go brang Mees Jan's apron; da goat eat it oop." </p>
                <p> "Ye did, did ye! What ye givin' us? Did n't I see ye a-chinnin' 'er whin I come
                    over de hill--she a-leanin' up ag'in' de fence, an' youse a-talkin' ter 'er, an'
                    ole Blowhard cryin' like his heart was broke?" </p>
                <p> "Eat up what apron?" said Tom, thoroughly mystified over the situation. </p>
                <p> "Stumpy eat da apron--I brang back--da half ta Mees Jan." </p>
                <p> "An' it took ye all the mornin' to give it to her?" said Tom thoughtfully,
                    looking <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0117" n="96"/> Carl straight in the eye, a
                    new vista opening before her. </p>
                <p> That night when the circle gathered about the lamp to hear Pop read, Carl was
                    missing. Tom had not sent for him. </p>

                <head>VII<lb/> THE CONTENTS OF CULLY'S MAIL</head>
                <p> WHEN Walking Delegate Crimmins had recovered from his amazement, after his
                    humiliating defeat at Tom's hands, he stood irresolute for a moment outside her
                    garden gate, indulged at some length in a form of profanity peculiar to his
                    class, and then walked direct to McGaw's house. </p>
                <p> That worthy Knight met him at the door. He had been waiting for him. </p>
                <p> Young Billy McGaw also saw Crimmins enter the gate, and promptly hid himself
                    under the broken-down steps. He hoped to overhear what was going on when the two
                    went out again. Young Billy's inordinate curiosity was quite natural. He had
                    heard enough of the current talk about the tenements and open lots to know that
                    something of a revengeful and retaliatory nature against the Grogans was in the
                    air; but as nobody who knew the exact details had confided them <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0119" n="98"/> to him, he had determined upon an
                    investigation of his own. He not only hated Cully, but the whole Grogan
                    household, for the pounding he had received at his hands, so he was anxious to
                    get even in some way. </p>
                <p> After McGaw had locked both doors, shutting out his wife and little Jack, their
                    youngest, he took a bottle from the shelf, filled two half-tumblers, and
                    squaring himself in his chair, said:-- </p>
                <p> "Did ye see her, Crimmy?" </p>
                <p> "I did," replied Crimmins, swallowing the whiskey at a gulp. </p>
                <p> "An' she 'll come in wid us, will she?" </p>
                <p> "She will, will she? She 'll come in nothin'. I jollied her about her flowers,
                    and thought I had her dead ter rights, when she up an' asked me what we was
                    a-goin' to do for her if she jined, an' afore I could tell her she opens the
                    front door and gives me the dead cold." </p>
                <p> "Fired ye?" exclaimed McGaw incredulously. </p>
                <p> "I 'm givin' it to ye straight, Dan; an' she pulled a gun on me, too,"--telling
                    the lie with perfect composure. "That woman 's no slouch, or I don't know 'em.
                    One thing ye can bet yer bottom dollar on--all h--- can't <pb

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0122" n="101"/> scare her. We've got to try some
                    other way." </p>
                <p> It was the peculiarly fertile quality of Crimmins's imagination that made him so
                    valuable to some of his friends. </p>
                <p> When the conspirators reached the door, neither Crimmins nor his father was in a
                    talkative mood, and Billy heard nothing. They lingered a moment on the sill,
                    within a foot of his head as he lay in a cramped position below, and then they
                    sauntered out, his father bareheaded, to the stable-yard. There McGaw leaned
                    upon a cart-wheel, listening dejectedly to Crimmins, who seemed to be outlining
                    a plan of some kind, which at intervals lightened the gloom of McGaw's despair,
                    judging from the expression of his father's face. Then he turned hurriedly to
                    the house, cursed his wife because he could not find his big fur cap, and
                    started across to the village. Billy followed, keeping a safe distance behind. </p>
                <p> Tom after Patsy's sad experience forbade him the streets, and never allowed him
                    out of her sight unless Cully or her father were with him. She knew a storm was
                    gathering, and she was watching the clouds and waiting <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0123" n="102"/> for the first patter of rain. When it
                    came she intended that every one of her people should be under cover. She had
                    sent for Carl and her two stablemen, and told them that if they were
                    dissatisfied in any way she wanted to know it at once. If the wages she was
                    paying were not enough, she was willing to raise them, but she wanted them
                    distinctly to understand that as she had built up the business herself, she was
                    the only one who had a right to manage it, adding that she would rather clean
                    and drive the horses herself than be dictated to by any person outside. She said
                    that she saw trouble brewing, and knew that her men would feel it first. They
                    must look out for themselves coming home late at night. At the brewery strike,
                    two years before, hardly a day passed that some of the non-union men were not
                    beaten into insensibility. </p>
                <p> That night Carl came back again to the porch door, and in his quiet, earnest way
                    said: "We have t'ink 'bout da Union. Da men not go--not laik da union man. We
                    not 'fraid"--tapping his hip-pocket, where, sailor-like, he always carried his
                    knife sheathed in a leather case. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0124" n="103"/>

                <p> Tom's eyes kindled as she looked into his manly face. She loved pluck and grit,
                    She knew the color of the blood running in this young fellow's veins. </p>
                <p> Week after week passed, and though now and then she caught the mutterings of
                    distant thunder, as Cully or some of the others overheard a remark on the
                    ferry-boat or about the post-office, no other signs of the threatened storm were
                    visible. </p>
                <p> Then it broke. </p>
                <p> One morning an important-looking envelope lay in her letter-box. It was long and
                    puffy, and was stamped in the upper corner with a picture of a brewery in full
                    operation. One end bore an inscription addressed to the postmaster, stating that
                    in case Mr. Thomas Grogan was not found within ten days, it should be returned
                    to Schwartz &amp; Co., Brewers. </p>
                <p> The village post-office had several other letter-boxes, faced with glass, so
                    that the contents of each could be seen from the outside. Two of these contained
                    similar envelopes, looking equally important, one being addressed to McGaw. </p>
                <p> When he had called for his mail, the close <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0125"
                        n="104"/> resemblance between the two envelopes seen in the letter-boxes set
                    McGaw to thinking. Actual scrutiny through the glass revealed the picture of the
                    brewery on each. He knew then that Tom had been asked to bid for the brewery
                    hauling. That night a special meeting of the Union was called at eight o'clock.
                    Quigg, Crimmins, and McGaw signed the call. </p>
                <p> "Hully gee, what a wad!" said Cully, when the postmaster passed Tom's big letter
                    out to him. One of Cully's duties was to go for the mail. </p>
                <p> When Pop broke the seal in Tom's presence,--one of Pop's duties was to open what
                    Cully brought,--out dropped a type-written sheet notifying Mr. Thomas Grogan
                    that sealed proposals would be received up to March 1st for "unloading, hauling,
                    and delivering to the bins of the Eagle Brewery" so many tons of coal and malt,
                    together with such supplies, etc. There were also blank forms in duplicate to be
                    duly filled up with the price and signature of the bidder. This contract was
                    given out once a year. Twice before it had been awarded to Thomas Grogan. The
                    year before a man from Stapleton <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0126" n="105"/> had
                    bid lowest, and had done the work. McGaw and his friends complained that it took
                    the bread out of Rockville's mouth; but as the bidder belonged to the Union, no
                    protest could be made. </p>
                <p> The morning after the meeting of the Union, McGaw went to New York by the early
                    boat. He carried a letter from Pete Lathers, the yardmaster, to Crane &amp;
                    Co., of so potent a character that the coal-dealers agreed to lend McGaw five
                    hundred dollars on his three-months' note, taking a chattel mortgage on his
                    teams and carts as security, the money to be paid McGaw as soon as the papers
                    were drawn. McGaw, in return, was to use his "pull" to get a permit from the
                    village trustees for the free use of the village dock by Crane &amp; Co. for
                    discharging their Rockville coal. This would save Crane half a mile to haul. It
                    was this promise made by McGaw which really turned the scale in his favor. To
                    hustle successfully it was often necessary for Crane to cut some sharp corners. </p>
                <p> This dock, as McGaw knew perfectly well, had been leased to another party--the
                    Fertilizing Company--for two years, and could <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0127"
                        n="106"/> not possibly be placed at Crane's disposal. But he said nothing of
                    this to Crane. </p>
                <p> When the day of payment to McGaw arrived, Dempsey of the executive committee and
                    Walking Delegate Quigg met McGaw at the ferry on his return from New York. McGaw
                    had Crane's money in his pocket. That night he paid two hundred dollars into the
                    Union, two hundred to his feed-man on an account long overdue, and the balance
                    to Quigg in a poker game in the back room over O'Leary's bar. </p>
                <p> Tom also had an interview with Mr. Crane shortly after his interview with McGaw.
                    Something she said about the dock having been leased to the Fertilizing Company
                    caused Crane to leave his chair in a hurry, and ask his clerk in an angry voice
                    if McGaw had yet been paid the money on his chattel mortgage. When his cashier
                    showed him the stub of the check, dated two days before, Crane slammed the door
                    behind him, his teeth set tight, little puffs of profanity escaping between the
                    openings. As he walked with Tom to the door, he said:-- </p>
                <p> "Send your papers up, Tom, I 'll go bond any day in the year for you, and for
                    any <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0128" n="107"/> amount; but I'll get even with
                    McGaw for that lie he told me about the dock, if it takes my bank account." </p>
                <p> The annual hauling contract for the brewery, which had become an important one
                    in Rockville, its business having nearly doubled in the last few years, was of
                    special value to Tom at this time, and she determined to make every effort to
                    secure it. </p>
                <p> Pop filled up the proposal in his round, clear hand, and Tom signed it, "Thomas
                    Grogan, Rockville, Staten Island." Then Pop witnessed it, and Mr. Crane, a few
                    days later, duly inscribed the firm's name under the clause reserved for
                    bondsmen. After that Tom brought the bid home, and laid it on the shelf over her
                    bed. </p>
                <p> Everything was now ready for the fight. </p>
                <p> The bids were to be opened at noon in the office of the brewery. </p>
                <p> By eleven o'clock the hangers-on and idlers began to lounge into the big yard
                    paved with cobblestones. At half past eleven McGaw got out of a buggy,
                    accompanied by Quigg. At a quarter to twelve Tom, in her hood and ulster, walked
                    rapidly through the gate, and, without as much as a look at the men gathered <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0129" n="108"/> about the office door, pushed her way into the room. Then she
                    picked up a chair and, placing it against the wall, sat down. Sticking out of
                    the breast pocket of her ulster was the big envelope containing her bid. </p>
                <p> Five minutes before the hour the men began filing in one by one, awkwardly
                    uncovering their heads, and standing in one another's way. Some, using their
                    hats as screens, looked over the rims. When the bids were being gathered up by
                    the clerk, Dennis Quigg handed over McGaw's. The ease with which Dan had raised
                    the money on his notes had invested that gentleman with some of the dignity and
                    attributes of a capitalist; the hired buggy and the obsequious Quigg indicated
                    this. His new position was strengthened by the liberal way in which he had
                    portioned out his possessions to the workingman. It was further sustained by the
                    hope that he might perhaps repeat his generosities in the near future. </p>
                <p> At twelve o'clock precisely Mr. Schwartz, a round, bullet-headed German, entered
                    the room, turned his revolving-chair, and began to cut the six envelopes heaped
                    up before him on his desk, reading the prices aloud as he <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0130" n="109"/> opened them in succession, the clerk
                    recording. The first four were from parties in outside villages. Then came
                    McGaw's:-- </p>
                <p> "Forty-nine cents for coal, etc." </p>
                <p> So far he was lowest. Quigg twisted his hat nervously, and McGaw's coarse face
                    grew red and white by turns. </p>
                <p> Tom's bid was the last. </p>
                <p> "Thomas Grogan, Rockville, S. I., thirty-eight cents for coal, etc." </p>
                <p> "Gentlemen," said Mr. Schwartz, quietly, "Thomas Grogan gets the hauling." </p>
            </div1>

            <div1 id="d15" type="chapter">

                <head>VIII<lb/> POP MULLINS'S ADVICE</head>
                <p> ALMOST every man and woman in the tenement district knew Oscar Schwartz, and had
                    felt the power of his obstinate hand during the long strike of two years before,
                    when, the Union having declared war, Schwartz had closed the brewery for several
                    months rather than submit to its dictation. The news, therefore, that the Union
                    had called a meeting and appointed a committee to wait on Mr. Schwartz, to
                    protest against his giving work to a non-union woman filled them with alarm. The
                    women remembered the privations and suffering of that winter, and the three
                    dollars a week doled out to them by the Central Branch, while their husbands,
                    who had been earning two and three dollars a day, were drinking at O'Leary's
                    bar, playing cards, or listening to the encouraging talk of the delegates who
                    came from New York to keep up their spirits. <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0132"
                        n="111"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0133" n="112"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0134" n="113"/> The brewery employed a larger number
                    of men than any other concern in Rockville, so trouble with its employees meant
                    serious trouble for half the village if Schwartz defied the Union and selected a
                    non-union woman to do the work. </p>
                <p> They knew, too, something of the indomitable pluck and endurance of Tom Grogan.
                    If she were lowest on the bids, she would fight for the contract, they felt
                    sure, if it took her last dollar. McGaw was a fool, they said, to bid so high;
                    he might have known she would cut his throat, and bring them no end of trouble. </p>
                <p> Having nursed their resentment, and needing a common object for their wrath, the
                    women broke out against Tom. Many of them had disliked her ever since the day,
                    years ago, when she had been seen carrying her injured husband away at night to
                    the hospital, after months of nursing at home. And the most envious had always
                    maintained that she meant at the time to put him away forever where no one could
                    find him, so that she might play the man herself. </p>
                <p> "Why should she be a-comin' in an' a-rob-bin' us of our pay?" muttered a coarse,
                    red-faced <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0135" n="114"/> virago, her hair in a
                    frowse about her head, her slatternly dress open at the throat. "Oi 'll be one
                    to go an' pull her off the dock and jump on her. What 's she a-doin', any-how,
                    puttin' down prices! Ef her ole man had a leg to walk on, instid of his lyin'
                    to-day a cripple in the hospital, he 'd be back and be a-runnin' things." </p>
                <p> "She 's doin' what she 's a right to do," broke out Mrs. Todd indignantly. Mrs.
                    Todd was the wife of the foreman at the brewery, and an old friend of Tom's. Tom
                    had sat up with her child only the week before. Indeed, there were few women in
                    the tenements, for all their outcry, who did not know how quick had been her
                    hand to help when illness came, or the landlord threatened the sidewalk, or the
                    undertaker insisted on his money in advance. </p>
                <p> "It 's not Tom Grogan that 's crooked," Mrs. Todd continued, "an' ye all know
                    it. It 's that loafer, Dennis Quigg, and that old sneak, Crimmins. They never
                    lifted their hands on a decent job in their lives, an' don't want to. When my
                    man Jack was out of work for four months last winter, and there was n't a pail
                    of coal in the house, was n't <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0136" n="115"/> Quigg
                    gittin' his four dollars a day for shoot-in' off his mouth every night at
                    O'Leary's, an' fillin' the men's heads full of capital and rights? An' Dan McGaw
                    's no better. If ye're out for jumpin' on people, Mrs. Moriarty, begin with
                    Quigg an' some of the bummers as is runnin' the Union, an' as gits paid whether
                    the men works or not." </p>
                <p> "Bedad, ye 're roight," said half a dozen women, the tide turning suddenly,
                    while the excitement grew and spread, and other women came in from the several
                    smaller tenements. </p>
                <p> "Is the trouble at the brewery?" asked a shrunken-looking woman, opening a door
                    on the corridor, a faded shawl over her head. She was a new-comer, and had been
                    in the tenement only a week or so--not long enough to have the run of the house
                    or to know her neighbors. </p>
                <p> "Yes; at Schwartz's," said Mrs. Todd, stopping opposite her door on the way to
                    her own rooms. "Your man 's got a job there, ain't he?" </p>
                <p> "He has, mum; he 's gateman--the fust job in six months. Ye don't think they 'll
                    make him throw it up, do ye, mum?" </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0137" n="116"/>

                <p> "Yes; an' break his head if he don't. Thet 's what they did to my man three
                    years gone, till he had to come in with the gang and pay 'em two dollars a
                    month," replied Mrs. Todd. </p>
                <p> "But my man 's jined, mum, a month ago; they would n't let him work till he did.
                    Won't ye come in an' set down? It 's a poor place we have--we 've been so long
                    without work, an' my girl 's laid off with a cough. She's been a-workin' at the
                    box-factory. If the Union give notice again, I don't know what 'll become of us.
                    Can't we do somethin'? Maybe Mrs. Grogan might give up the work if she knew how
                    it was wid us. She seems like a dacent woman; she was in to look at me girl last
                    week, hearin' as how we were strangers an' she very bad." </p>
                <p> "Oh, ye don't know her. Ye can save yer wind and shoe-leather. She 's on ter
                    McGaw red hot; that 's the worst of it. He better look out; she'll down him
                    yet," said Mrs. Todd. </p>
                <p> As the two entered the stuffy, close room for further discussion, a young girl
                    left her seat by the window, and moved into the adjoining apartment. She had
                    that yellow, <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0138" n="117"/> waxy skin, hollow,
                    burning eyes, and hectic flush which tell the fatal story so clearly. </p>
                <p> While the women of the tenements were cursing or wringing their hands, the men
                    were devoting themselves to more vigorous measures. A meeting was called for
                    nine o'clock at Lion Hall. </p>
                <p> It was held behind closed doors. Two walking delegates from Brooklyn were
                    present, having been summoned by telegram the night before, and who were
                    expected to coax or bully the weak-kneed, were the ultimatum sent to Schwartz
                    refused and an order for a sympathetic strike issued. </p>
                <p> At the brewery all was quiet. Schwartz had read the notice left on his desk by
                    the committee the night before, and had already begun his arrangements to supply
                    the places of the men if a strike were ordered. When pressed by Quigg for a
                    reply, he said quietly:-- </p>
                <p> "The price for hauling will be Grogan's bid. If she wants it, it is hers." </p>
                <p> Tom talked the matter over with Pop, and had determined to buy another horse and
                    hire two extra carts. At her price there was a margin of at least ten cents a
                    ton profit, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0139" n="118"/> as the work lasted
                    through the year, she could adjust the hauling of her other business without
                    much extra expense. She discussed the situation with no one outside her house.
                    If Schwartz wanted her to carry on the work, she would do it, Union or no Union.
                    Mr. Crane was on her bond. That in itself was a bracing factor. Strong and
                    self-reliant as she was, the helping hand which this man held out to her was
                    like an anchor in a storm. </p>
                <p> That Sunday night they were all gathered round the kerosene lamp,--Pop reading,
                    Cully and Patsy on the floor, Jennie listening absent-mindedly, her thoughts far
                    away,--when there came a knock at the kitchen door. Jennie flew to open it. </p>
                <p> Outside stood two women. One was Mrs. Todd, the other the haggard, pinched,
                    careworn woman who had spoken to her that morning at her room-door in the
                    tenement. </p>
                <p> "They want to see you, mother," said Jennie, all the light gone out of her eyes.
                    What could be the matter with Carl, she thought. It had been this way for a
                    week. </p>
                <p> "Well, bring 'em in. Hold on, I 'll go meself." </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0140" n="119"/>

                <p> "She <hi rend="italic">would</hi> come, Tom," said Mrs. Todd, unwinding her
                    shawl from her head and shoulders; "an' ye must n't blame me, fer it 's none of
                    my doin's. Walk in, mum; ye can speak to her yerself. Why, where is
                    she?"--looking out of the door into the darkness. "Oh, here ye are; I thought ye
                    'd skipped." </p>
                <p> "Do ye remember me?" said the woman, stepping into the room, her gaunt face
                    looking more wretched under the flickering light of the candle than it had done
                    in the morning. "I 'm the new-comer in the tenements. Ye were in to see my girl
                    th' other night. We 're in great trouble." </p>
                <p> "She's not dead?" said Tom, sinking into-a chair. </p>
                <p> "No, thank God; we 've got her still wid us; but me man 's come home to-night
                    nigh crazy. He's a-walkin' the floor this minute, an' so I goes to Mrs. Todd,
                    an' she come wid me. If he loses the job now, we're in the street. Only two
                    weeks' work since las' fall, an' the girl gettin' worse every day, and every
                    cint in the bank gone, an' hardly a chair lef' in the place. An' I says to him,
                    'I'll go meself. She come in to see Katie <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0141"
                        n="120"/> th' other night; she'll listen to me.' We lived in Newark, mum,
                    an' had four rooms and a mahogany sofa and two carpets, till the strike come in
                    the clock-factory, an' me man had to quit; an' then all winter--oh, we're not
                    used to the likes of this!"--covering her face with her shawl and bursting into
                    tears. </p>
                <p> Tom had risen to her feet, her face expressing the deepest sympathy for the
                    woman, though she was at a loss to understand the cause of her visitor's
                    distress. </p>
                <p> "Is yer man fired?" she asked. </p>
                <p> "No, an' would n't be if they 'd let him alone. He 's sober an' steady, an'
                    never tastes a drop, and brings his money home to me every Saturday night, and
                    always done; an' now they"-- </p>
                <p> "Well, what 's the matter, then?" Tom could not stand much beating about the
                    bush. </p>
                <p> "Why, don't ye know they 've give notice?" she said in astonishment; then, as a
                    misgiving entered her mind, "Maybe I 'm wrong; but me man an' all of 'em tells
                    me ye 're a-buckin' ag'in' Mr. McGaw, an' that ye has the haulin' job at the
                    brewery." </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0142" n="121"/>

                <p> "No," said Tom, with emphasis, "ye 're not wrong; ye 're dead right. But who 's
                    give notice?" </p>
                <p> "The committee's give notice, an' the boss at the brewery says he 'll give ye
                    the job if he has to shut up the brewery; an' the committee's decided to-day
                    that if he does they 'll call out the men. My man is a member, and so I come
                    over"--And she rested her head wearily against the door, the tears streaming
                    down her face. </p>
                <p> Tom looked at her wonderingly, and then, putting her strong arms about her, half
                    carried her across the kitchen to a chair by the stove. Mrs. Todd leaned against
                    the table, watching the sobbing woman. </p>
                <p> For a moment no one spoke. It was a new experience for Tom. Heretofore the fight
                    had been her own and for her own. She had never supposed before that she filled
                    so important a place in the neighborhood, and for a moment there flashed across
                    her mind a certain justifiable pride in the situation. But this feeling was
                    momentary. Here was a suffering woman. For the first time she realized that one
                    weaker than herself might suffer in the struggle. What could <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0143" n="122"/> she do to help her? This thought was
                    uppermost in her mind. </p>
                <p> "Don't ye worry," she said tenderly. "Schwartz won't fire yer man." </p>
                <p> "No; but the sluggers will. There was five men 'p'inted to-day to do up the
                    scabs an' the kickers who won't go out, They near killed him once in Newark for
                    kickin'. It was that time, you know, when Katie was first took bad." </p>
                <p> "Do ye know their names?" said Tom, her eyes flashing. </p>
                <p> "No, an' me man don't. He's new, an' they dar's n't trust him. It was in the
                    back room, he says, they picked 'em out." </p>
                <p> Tom stood for some moments in deep thought, gazing at the fire, her arms akimbo.
                    Then, wheeling suddenly, she opened the door of the sitting-room, and said in a
                    firm, resolute voice:-- </p>
                <p> "Gran'pop, come here; I want ye." </p>
                <p> The old man laid down his book, and stood in the kitchen doorway. He was in his
                    shirt-sleeves, his spectacles on his forehead. </p>
                <p> "Come inside the kitchen, an' shut that door behind ye. Here 's me friend Jane
                    Todd an' a friend of hers from the tenement. <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0144"
                        n="123"/>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0145" n="124"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0146" n="125"/> That thief of a McGaw has stirred up
                    the Union over the haulin' bid, and they 've sent notice to Schwartz that I
                    don't belong to the Union, an' if he don't throw me over an' give the job to
                    McGaw they'll call out the men. If they do, there's a hundred women and three
                    times that many children that 'll go hungry. This woman here 's got a girl
                    herself that has n't drawed a well breath for six months, an' her man 's been
                    idle all winter, an' only just now got a job at Schwartz's, tending gate. Now,
                    what 'll I do? Shall I chuck up the job or stick?" </p>
                <p> The old man looked into the desolate, weary face of the woman and then at Tom.
                    Then he said slowly:-- </p>
                <p> "Well, child, ye kin do widout it, an' maybe t' others can't." </p>
                <p> "Ye've got it straight," said Tom; "that 's just what I think meself." Then,
                    turning to the stranger:-- </p>
                <p> "Go home and tell yer man to go to bed. I 'll touch nothin' that'll break the
                    heart of any woman, The job 's McGaw's. I 'll throw up me bid." </p>

                <head>IX<lb/> WHAT A SPARROW SAW</head>
                <p> EVER since the eventful morning when Carl had neglected the Big Gray for a
                    stolen hour with Jennie, Cully had busied himself in devising ways of making the
                    Swede's life miserable. With a boy's keen insight, he had discovered enough to
                    convince him that Carl was "dead mashed on Jennie," as he put it, but whether
                    "for keeps" or not he had not yet determined. He had already enriched his songs
                    with certain tender allusions to their present frame of mind and their future
                    state of happiness. "Where was Moses when the light went out!" and "Little Annie
                    Rooney" had undergone so subtle a change when sung at the top of Mr. James
                    Finnegan's voice that while the original warp and woof of those very popular
                    melodies were entirely unrecognizable to any but the persons interested, to them
                    they were as gall and wormwood. This <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0148" n="127"/>
                    was Cully's invariable way of expressing his opinions on current affairs. He
                    would sit on the front-board of his cart,--the Big Gray stumbling over the
                    stones as he walked, the reins lying loose,--and fill the air with details of
                    events passing in the village, with all the gusto of a variety actor. The
                    impending strike at the brewery had been made the basis of a paraphrase of
                    "Johnnie, get your gun;" and even McGaw's red head had come in for its share of
                    abuse to the air of "Fire, boys, fire!" So for a time this new development of
                    tenderness on the part of Carl for Jennie served to ring the changes on "Moses"
                    and "Annie Rooney." </p>
                <p> Carl's budding hopes had been slightly nipped by the cold look in Tom's eye when
                    she asked him if it took an hour to give Jennie a tattered apron. With some
                    disappointment he noticed that except at rare intervals, and only when Tom was
                    at home, he was no longer invited to the house. He had always been a timid,
                    shrinking fellow where a woman was concerned, having followed the sea and lived
                    among men since he was sixteen years old. During these earlier years he had made
                    two voyages in the Pacific, and another to <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0149"
                        n="128"/> the whaling-ground in the Arctic seas. On this last voyage, in a
                    gale of wind, he had saved all the lives aboard a brig, the crew helpless from
                    scurvy. When the lifeboat reached the lee of her stern, Carl at the risk of his
                    life climbed aboard, caught a line, and lowered the men, one by one, into the
                    rescuing yawl. He could with perfect equanimity have faced another storm and
                    rescued a second crew any hour of the day or night, but he could not face a
                    woman's displeasure. Moreover, what Tom wanted done was law to Carl. She had
                    taken him out of the streets and given him a home. He would serve her in
                    whatever way she wished as long as he lived. </p>
                <p> He and Gran'pop were fast friends. On rainy days, or when work was dull in the
                    winter months, the old man would often come into Carl's little chamber, next the
                    harness-room in the stable, and sit on his bed by the hour. And Carl would tell
                    him about his people at home, and show him the pictures tacked over his bed,
                    those of his old mother with her white cap, and of the young sister who was soon
                    to be married. </p>
                <p> On Sundays Carl followed Tom and her <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0150" n="129"/>
                    family to church, waiting until they had left the house. He always sat far back
                    near the door, so that he could see them come out. Then he would overtake Pop
                    with Patsy, whenever the little fellow could go. This was not often, for now
                    there were many days when the boy had to lie all day on the lounge in the
                    sitting-room, poring over his books or playing with Stumpy, brought into the
                    kitchen to amuse him. </p>
                <p> Since the day of Tom's warning look, Carl rarely joined her daughter. Jennie
                    would loiter by the way, speaking to the girls, but he would hang back. He felt
                    that Tom did not want them together. </p>
                <p> One spring morning, however, a new complication arose. It was a morning when the
                    sky was a delicate violet-blue, when the sunlight came tempered through a tender
                    land haze and a filmy mist from the still sea, when all the air was redolent
                    with sweet smells of coming spring, and all the girls were gay in new attire.
                    Dennis Quigg had been lounging outside the church door, his silk hat and green
                    satin necktie glistening in the sun. When Jennie tripped out Quigg started
                    forward. The look on his face, as with swinging <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0151"
                        n="130"/> shoulders he slouched beside her, sent a thrill of indignation
                    through Carl. He could give her up, perhaps, if Tom insisted, but never to a man
                    like Quigg. Before the walking delegate had "passed the time of day," the young
                    sailor was close beside Jennie, within touch of her hand. </p>
                <p> There was no love lost between the two men. Carl had not forgotten the
                    proposition Quigg had made to him to leave Tom's employ, nor had Quigg forgotten
                    the uplifted shovel with which his proposal had been greeted. Yet there was no
                    well-defined jealousy between them. Mr. Walking Delegate Dennis Quigg,
                    confidential agent of Branch No. 3, Knights of Labor, had too good an opinion of
                    himself ever to look upon that "tow-headed duffer of a stable-boy" in the light
                    of a rival. Nor could Carl for a moment think of that narrow-chested, red-faced,
                    flashily dressed Knight as being able to make the slightest impression on "Mees
                    Jan." </p>
                <p> Quigg, however, was more than welcome to Jennie to-day. A little sense of
                    wounded pride sent the hot color to her cheeks when she thought of Carl's
                    apparent neglect. He <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0152" n="131"/> had hardly
                    spoken to her in weeks. What had she done that he should treat her so? She would
                    show him that there were just as good fellows about as Mr. Carl Nilsson. </p>
                <p> But all this faded out when Carl joined her--Carl, so straight, clear-skinned,
                    brown, and ruddy; his teeth so white; his eyes so blue! She could see out of the
                    corner of her eye how the hair curled in tiny rings on his temples. </p>
                <p> Still it was to Quigg she talked. And more than that, she gave him her
                    prayer-book to carry until she fixed her glove--the glove that needed no fixing
                    at all. And she chattered on about the dance at the boat club, and the picnic
                    which was to come off when the weather grew warmer. </p>
                <p> And Carl walked silent beside her, with his head up and his heart down, and the
                    tears very near his eyes. </p>
                <p> When they reached the outer gate of the stable-yard, and Quigg had slouched off
                    without even raising his hat,--the absence of all courtesy stands in a certain
                    class for a mark of higher respect,--Carl swung back the gate, and held it open
                    for her to pass in. Jennie loitered for a moment. There was a <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0153" n="132"/> look in Carl's face she had not seen
                    before. She had not meant to hurt him, she said to herself. </p>
                <p> "What mak' you no lak me anna more, Mees Jan? I big annough to carry da buke,"
                    said Carl. </p>
                <p> "Why, how you talk, Carl! I never said such a word," said Jennie, leaning over
                    the fence, her heart fluttering. </p>
                <p> The air was soft as a caress. Opal-tinted clouds with violet shadows sailed
                    above the low hills. In the shade of the fence dandelions had burst into bloom.
                    From a bush near by a song-sparrow flung a note of spring across the meadow. </p>
                <p> "Well, you nev' cam' to stable anna more, Mees Jan," Carl said slowly, in a
                    tender, pleading tone, his gaze on her face. </p>
                <p> The girl reached through the fence for the golden flower. She dared not trust
                    herself to look. She knew what was in her lover's eyes. </p>
                <p> "I get ta flower," said Carl, vaulting the fence with one hand. </p>
                <p> "No; please don't trouble. Oh, Carl!" she exclaimed suddenly. "The horrid brier!
                    My hand 's all scratched! " </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0154" n="133"/>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0155" n="134"/>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0156" n="135"/>

                <p> "Ah, Mees Jan, I so sorry! Let Carl see it," he said, his voice melting. "I tak'
                    ta brier out," pushing back the tangled vines of last year to bring himself
                    nearer. </p>
                <p> The clouds sailed on. The sparrow stood, on its tallest toes and twisted its
                    little neck. </p>
                <p> "Oh, please do, Carl, it hurts so!" she said, laying her little round hand in
                    the big, strong, horny palm that had held the life-line the night of the wreck. </p>
                <p> The song-sparrow clung to the swaying top of a mullein-stalk near by, and poured
                    out a strong, swelling, joyous song that well-nigh split its throat. </p>
                <p> When Tom called Jennie, half an hour later, she and Carl were still talking
                    across the fence. </p>

                <head>X<lb/> CULLY WINS BY A NECK</head>
                <p> ABOUT this time the labor element in the village and vicinity was startled by an
                    advertisement in the Rockville "Daily News," signed by the clerk of the Board of
                    Village Trustees, notifying contractors that thirty days thereafter, closing at
                    nine P. M. precisely, separate sealed proposals would be received at the
                    meeting-room of the board, over the post-office, for the hauling of twenty
                    thousand cubic yards of fine crushed stone for use on the public highways;
                    bidders would be obliged to give suitable bonds, etc.; certified check for five
                    hundred dollars to accompany each bid as guaranty, etc. </p>
                <p> The news was a grateful surprise to the workingmen. The hauling and placing of
                    so large an amount of material as soon as spring opened meant plenty of work for
                    many shovelers and pickers. The local politicians, of course, had known all
                    about it for weeks; <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0158" n="137"/> especially those
                    who owned property fronting on the streets to be improved: they had helped the
                    appropriation through the finance committee. McGaw, too, had known about it from
                    the first day of its discussion before the board. Those who were inside the ring
                    had decided then that he would be the best man to haul the stone. The "steal,"
                    they knew, could best be arranged in the tally of the carts--the final check on
                    the scow measurement. They knew that McGaw's accounts could be controlled, and
                    the total result easily "fixed." The stone itself had been purchased of the
                    manufacturers the year before, but there were not funds enough to put it on the
                    roads at that time. </p>
                <p> Here, then, was McGaw's chance. His triumph at obtaining the brewery contract
                    was but short-lived. Schwartz had given him the work, but at Tom's price, not at
                    his own. McGaw had accepted it, hoping for profits that would help him with his
                    chattel mortgage. After he had been at work for a month, however, he found that
                    he ran behind. He began to see that, in spite of its boastings, the Union had
                    really done nothing <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0159" n="138"/> for him, except
                    indirectly with its threatened strike. The Union, on the other hand, insisted
                    that it had been McGaw's business to arrange his own terms with Schwartz. What
                    it had done was to kill Grogan as a competitor, and knock her non-union men out
                    of the job. This ended its duty. </p>
                <p> While they said this much to McGaw; so far as outsiders could know, the Union
                    claimed that they had scored a brilliant victory. The Brooklyn and New York
                    branches duly paraded it as another triumph over capital, and their bank
                    accounts were accordingly increased with new dues and collections. </p>
                <p> With this new contract in his possession, McGaw felt certain he could cancel his
                    debt with Crane and get even with the world. He began his arrangements at once.
                    Police-Justice Rowan, the prospective candidate for the Assembly, who had
                    acquired some landed property by the purchase of expired tax titles, agreed to
                    furnish the certified check for five hundred dollars and to sign McGaw's bond
                    for a consideration to be subsequently agreed upon. A brother of Rowan's, a
                    contractor, who was finishing some grading at Quarantine Landing, had also
                    consented, for a consideration, <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0160" n="139"/> to
                    loan McGaw what extra teams he required. </p>
                <p> The size of the contract was so great, and the deposit check and bond were so
                    large, that McGaw concluded at once that the competition would be narrowed down
                    between himself and Rowan's brother, with Justice Rowan as backer, and perhaps
                    one other firm from across the island, near New Brighton. His own advantage over
                    other bidders was in his living on the spot, with his stables and teams near at
                    hand. </p>
                <p> Tom, he felt assured, was out of the way. Not only was the contract very much
                    too large for her, requiring twice as many carts as she possessed, but now that
                    the spring work was about to begin, and Babcock's sea-wall work to be resumed,
                    she had all the stevedoring she could do for her own customers, without going
                    outside for additional business. </p>
                <p> Moreover, she had apparently given up the fight, for she had bid on no work of
                    any kind since the morning she had called upon Schwartz and told him, in her
                    blunt, frank way, "Give the work to McGaw at me price. It 's enough and fair." </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0161" n="140"/>

                <p> Tom, meanwhile, made frequent visits to New York, returning late at night. One
                    day she brought home a circular with cuts of several improved kinds of
                    hoisting-engines with automatic dumping-buckets. She showed them to Pop under
                    the kerosene lamp at night, explaining to him their advantages in handling small
                    material like coal or broken stone. Once she so far relaxed her rules in regard
                    to Jennie's lover as to send for Carl to come to the house after supper,
                    questioning him closely about the upper rigging of a new derrick she had seen.
                    Carl's experience as a sailor was especially valuable in matters of this kind.
                    He could not only splice a broken "fall," and repair the sheaves and
                    friction-rollers in a hoisting-block, but whenever the rigging got tangled aloft
                    he could spring up the derrick like a cat and unreeve the rope in an instant.
                    She also wrote to Babcock, asking him to stop at her house some morning on his
                    way to the Quarantine Landing, where he was building a retaining-wall; and when
                    he arrived, she took him out to the shed where she kept her heavy derricks. That
                    more experienced contractor at once became deeply interested, and made a <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0162" n="141"/> series of sketches for her, on the back of an envelope, of an
                    improved pintle and revolving-cap which he claimed would greatly improve the
                    working of her derricks. These sketches she took to the village blacksmith next
                    day, and by that night had an estimate of their cost. She was also seen one
                    morning, when the new trolley company got rid of its old stock, at a sale of
                    car-horses, watching the prices closely, and examining the condition of the
                    animals sold. She asked the superintendent to drop her a postal when the next
                    sale occurred. To her neighbors, however, and even to her own men, she said
                    nothing. The only man in the village to whom she had spoken regarding the new
                    work was the clerk of the board, and then only casually as to the exact time
                    when the bids would be received. </p>
                <p> The day before the eventful night when the proposals were to be opened, Mr.
                    Crane, in his buggy, stopped at her house on his way back from the fort, and
                    they drove together to the ferry. When she returned she called Pop into the
                    kitchen, shut the door, and showed him the bid duly signed and a slip of pink
                    paper. This was a check of Crane <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0163" n="142"/>
                    &amp; Co.'s to be deposited with the bid. Then she went down to the stable
                    and had a long conference with Cully. </p>
                <p> The village Board of Trustees consisted of nine men, representing a fair average
                    of the intelligence and honesty of the people. The president was a reputable
                    hardware merchant, a very good citizen, who kept a store largely patronized by
                    local contractors. The other members were two lawyers,--young men working up in
                    practice with the assistance of a political pull,--a veterinary surgeon, and
                    five gentlemen of leisure, whose only visible means of support were derived from
                    pool-rooms and ward meetings. Every man on the board, except the surgeon and the
                    president, had some particular axe to grind. One wished to be sheriff; another,
                    county clerk. The five gentlemen of leisure wished to stay where they were. When
                    a pie was cut, these five held the knife. It was their fault, they said, when
                    they went hungry. </p>
                <p> In the side of this body politic the surgeon was a thorn as sharp as any one of
                    his scalpels. He was a hard-headed, sober-minded Scotchman, who had been elected
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0164" n="143"/> to represent a group of his
                    countrymen living in the eastern part of the village, and whose profession, the
                    five supposed, indicated without doubt his entire willingness to see through a
                    cart-wheel, especially when the hub was silver-plated. At the first meeting of
                    the board they learned their mistake, but it did not worry them much. They had
                    seven votes to two. </p>
                <p> The council-chamber of the board was a hall--large for Rockville--situated over
                    the post-office, and only two doors from O'Leary's barroom It was the ordinary
                    village hall, used for everything from a Christmas festival to a prize-fight. In
                    summer it answered for a skating-rink. </p>
                <p> Once a month the board occupied it. On these occasions a sort of rostrum was
                    brought in for the president, besides a square table and a dozen chairs. These
                    were placed at one end, and were partitioned off by a wooden rail to form an
                    inclosure, outside of which always stood the citizens. On the wall hung a big
                    eight-day clock. Over the table, about which were placed chairs, a kerosene lamp
                    swung on a brass chain. Opposite each seat lay a square of blotting-paper and
                    some cheap <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0165" n="144"/> pens and paper. Down the
                    middle of the table were three inkstands, standing in china plates. </p>
                <p> The board always met in the evening, as the business hours of the members
                    prevented their giving the day to their deliberations. </p>
                <p> Upon the night of the letting of the contract the first man to arrive was McGaw.
                    He ran up the stairs hurriedly, found no one he was looking for, and returned to
                    O'Leary's, where he was joined by Justice Rowan and his brother John, the
                    contractor, Quigg, Crimmins, and two friends of the Union. During the last week
                    the Union was outspoken in its aid of McGaw, and its men had quietly passed the
                    word of "Hands off this job!" about in the neighborhood. If McGaw got the
                    work--and there was now not the slightest doubt of it--he would, of course,
                    employ all Union men. If anybody else got it--well, they would attend to him
                    later. "One thing was certain: no 'scab' from New Brighton should come over and
                    take it." They'd do up anybody who tried that game. </p>
                <p> When McGaw, surrounded by his friends, <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0166" n="145"
                    /> entered the board-room again, the place was full. Outside the rail stood a
                    solid mass of people. Inside every seat was occupied. It was too important a
                    meeting for any trustee to miss. </p>
                <p> McGaw stood on his toes and looked over the heads. To his delight, Tom was not
                    in the room, and no one representing her. If he had had any lingering suspicion
                    of her bidding, her non-appearance allayed it. He knew now that she was out of
                    the race. Moreover, no New Brighton people had come. He whispered this
                    information to Justice Rowan's brother behind his big, speckled hand covered
                    with its red, spidery hair. Then the two forced their way out again, reentered
                    the post-office, and borrowed a pen. Once there, McGaw took from his side pocket
                    two large envelopes, the contents of which he spread out under the light. </p>
                <p> "I 'm dead roight," said McGaw. "I 'll put up the price of this other bid. There
                    ain't a man round here that dares show his head. The Union 's fixed 'em." </p>
                <p> "Will the woman bid?" asked his companion. </p>
                <p> "The woman! What 'd she be a-doin' wid <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0167" n="146"
                    /> a bid loike that? She c'u'd n't handle the half of it. I 'll wait till a few
                    minutes to nine o'clock. Ye kin fix up both these bids an' hold 'em in yer
                    pocket. Thin we kin see what bids is laid on the table. Ours 'll go in last. If
                    there 's nothin' else we'll give 'em the high one. I 'll git inside the rail, so
                    's to be near the table." </p>
                <p> When the two squeezed back through the throng again into the board-room, even
                    the staircase was packed. McGaw pulled off his fur cap and struggled past the
                    rail, bowing to the president. The justice's brother stood outside, within reach
                    of McGaw's hand. McGaw glanced at the clock and winked complacently at his
                    prospective partner--not a single bid had been handed in. Then he thrust out his
                    long arm, took from Rowan's brother the big envelope containing the higher bid,
                    and dropped it on the table. </p>
                <p> Just then there was a commotion at the door. Somebody was trying to force a
                    passage in. The president rose from his chair, and looked over the crowd. McGaw
                    started from his chair, looked anxiously at the clock, then at his partner. The
                    body of a boy struggling like an eel worked its way through <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0168" n="147"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0169" n="148"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0170" n="149"/> the mass, dodged under the wooden
                    bar, and threw an envelope on the table. </p>
                <p> "Dat 's Tom Grogan's bid," he said, looking at the president. "Hully gee! but
                    dat was a close shave! She telled me not ter dump it till one minute o' nine,
                    an' de bloke at de door come near sp'ilin' de game till I give him one in de
                    mug." </p>
                <p> At this instant the clock struck nine, and the president's gavel fell. </p>
                <p> "Time 's up," said the Scotchman. </p>
            </div1>

            <div1 id="d18" type="chapter">

                <head>XI<lb/> A TWO-DOLLAR BILL</head>
                <p> THE excitement over the outcome of the bidding was intense. The barroom at
                    O'Leary's was filled with a motley crowd of men, most of whom belonged to the
                    Union, and all of whom had hoped to profit in some way had the contract fallen
                    into the hands of the political ring who were dominating the affairs of the
                    village. The more hot-headed and outspoken swore vengeance; not only against the
                    horse-doctor, who had refused to permit McGaw to smuggle in the second bid, but
                    against Crane &amp; Co. and everybody else who had helped to defeat their
                    schemes. They meant to boycott Crane before tomorrow night. He should not unload
                    or freight another cargo of coal until they allowed it. The village powers, they
                    admitted, could not be boycotted, but they would do everything they could to
                    make it uncomfortable for the board if it awarded <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0172" n="151"/>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0173" n="152"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0174" n="153"/> the contract to Grogan. Neither would
                    they forget the trustees at the next election. As to that "smart Alec" of a
                    horse-doctor, they knew how to fix him. Suppose it had struck nine and the polls
                    had closed, what right had he to keep McGaw from handing in his other bid? (Both
                    were higher than Tom's. This fact, however, McGaw had never mentioned.) </p>
                <p> Around the tenements the interest was no less marked. Mr. Moriarty had sent the
                    news of Tom's success ringing through O'Leary's, and Mrs. Moriarty, waiting
                    outside the barroom door for the pitcher her husband had filled for her inside,
                    had spread its details through every hallway in the tenement. </p>
                <p> "Ah, but Tom 's a keener," said that gossip. "Think of that little divil Cully
                    jammed behind the door with her bid in his hand, a-waitin' for the clock to get
                    round to two minutes o' nine, an' that big stuff Dan McGaw sittin' inside wid
                        <hi rend="italic">two</hi> bids up his sleeve! Oh, but she 's cunnin', she
                    is! Dan 's clean beat. He'll niver haul a shovel o' that stone." </p>
                <p> "How 'll she be a-doin' a job like that?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0175"
                        n="154"/> came from a woman listening over the banisters. </p>
                <p> "Be doin'?" rejoined a red-headed virago. "Would n't ye be doin' it yerself if
                    ye had that big coal-dealer behind ye?" </p>
                <p> "Oh, we hear enough. Who says they 're in it?" rejoined a third listener. </p>
                <p> "Pete Lathers says so--the yard boss. He was a-tellin' me man yisterday." </p>
                <p> On consulting Justice Rowan the next morning, McGaw and his friends found but
                    little comfort. The law was explicit, the justice said. The contract must be
                    given to the lowest responsible bidder. Tom had deposited her certified check of
                    five hundred dollars with the bid, and there was no informality in her proposal.
                    He was sorry for McGaw, but if Mrs. Grogan signed the contract there was no hope
                    for him. The horse-doctor's action was right. If McGaw's second bid had been
                    received, it would simply have invalidated both of his, the law forbidding two
                    from the same bidder. </p>
                <p> Rowan's opinion sustaining Tom's right was a blow he did not expect.
                    Furthermore, the justice offered no hope for the future. The law gave Tom the
                    award, and nothing <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0176" n="155"/> could prevent her
                    hauling the stone if she signed the contract. These words rang in McGaw's
                        ears--<hi rend="italic">if she signed the contract</hi>. On this <hi
                        rend="italic">if</hi> hung his only hope. </p>
                <p> Rowan was too shrewd a politician, now that McGaw's chances were gone, to advise
                    any departure, even by a hair-line, from the strict letter of the law. He was,
                    moreover, too upright as a justice to advise any member of the defeated party to
                    an overt act which might look like unfairness to any bidder concerned. He had
                    had a talk, besides, with his brother over night, and they had accordingly
                    determined to watch events. Should a way be found of rejecting on legal grounds
                    Tom's bid, making a new advertisement necessary, Rowan meant to ignore McGaw
                    altogether, and have his brother bid in his own name. This determination was
                    strengthened when McGaw, in a burst of confidence, told Rowan of his present
                    financial straits. </p>
                <p> From Rowan's the complaining trio adjourned to O'Leary's barroom. Crimmins and
                    McGaw entered first. Quigg arrived later. He closed one eye meaningly as he
                    entered, and O'Leary handed a brass key to <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0177"
                        n="156"/> him over the bar with the remark, "Stamp on the floor three
                    toimes, Dinny, an' I 'll send yez up what ye want to drink." Then Crimmins
                    opened a door concealed by a wooden screen, and the three disappeared upstairs.
                    Crimmins reappeared within an hour, and hurried out the front door. In a few
                    moments he returned with Justice Rowan, who had adjourned court. Immediately
                    after the justice's arrival there came three raps from the floor above, and
                    O'Leary swung back the door, and disappeared with an assortment of drinkables on
                    a tray. </p>
                <p> The conference lasted until noon. Then the men separated outside the barroom.
                    From the expression on the face of each one as he emerged from the door it was
                    evident that the meeting had not produced any very cheering or conclusive
                    results. McGaw had that vindictive, ugly, bulldog look about the eyes and mouth
                    which always made his wife tremble when he came home. The result of the present
                    struggle over the contract was a matter of life or death to him. His notes,
                    secured by the chattel mortgage on his live stock, would be due in a few days.
                    Crane had already notified him that they must be <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0178" n="157"/> paid, and he knew enough of his
                    moneylender, and of the anger which he had roused, to know that no extension
                    would be granted him. Losing this contract, he had lost his only hope of paying
                    them. Had it been awarded him, he could have found a dozen men who would have
                    loaned him the money to take up these notes and so to pay Crane. He had
                    comforted himself the night before with the thought that Justice Rowan could
                    find some way to help him out of his dilemma; that the board would vote as the
                    justice advised, and then, of course, Tom's bid would be invalidated. Now even
                    this hope had failed him. "Whoever heard of a woman's doing a job for a city?"
                    he kept repeating mechanically to himself. </p>
                <p> Tom knew of none of these conspiracies. Had she done so they would not have
                    caused her a moment's anxiety. Here was a fight in which no one would suffer
                    except the head that got in her way, and she determined to hit that with all her
                    might the moment it rose into view. This was no brewery contract, she argued
                    with Pop, where five hundred men might be thrown out of employment, with all the
                    attendant suffering to <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0179" n="158"/> women and
                    children. The village was a power nobody could boycott. Moreover, the law
                    protected her in her rights under the award. She would therefore quietly wait
                    until the day for signing the papers arrived, furnish her bond, and begin a work
                    she could superintend herself. In the mean time she would continue her
                    preparations. One thing she was resolved upon--she would have nothing to do with
                    the Union. Carl could lay his hand on a dozen of his countrymen who would be
                    glad to get employment with her. If they were all like him she need have no fear
                    in any emergency. </p>
                <p> She bought two horses--great strong ones,--at the trolley sale, and ordered two
                    new carts from a manufacturer in Newark, to be sent to her on the first of the
                    coming month. </p>
                <p> Her friends took her good fortune less calmly. Their genuine satisfaction
                    expressed itself in a variety of ways. Crane sent her this characteristic
                    telegram:-- </p>
                <p> "Bully for you!" </p>
                <p> Babcock came all the way down to her home to offer her his congratulations, and
                    to tender her what assistance she needed in tools or money. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0180" n="159"/>

                <p> The Union, in their deliberations, insisted that it was the "raised bid" which
                    had ruined the business with McGaw and for them. It was therefore McGaw's duty
                    to spare no effort to prevent her signing the contract. They had stuck by him in
                    times gone by; he must now stick by them. One point was positively insisted
                    upon: Union men must be employed on the work, whoever got it. </p>
                <p> McGaw, however, was desperate. He denounced Tom in a vocabulary peculiar to
                    himself and full of innuendoes and oaths, but without offering any suggestion as
                    to how his threats against her might be carried out. </p>
                <p> With his usual slyness, Quigg said very little openly. He had not yet despaired
                    of winning Jennie's favor, and until that hope was abandoned he could hardly
                    make up his mind which side of the fence he was on. Crimmins was even more
                    indifferent in regard to the outcome--his pay as walking delegate went on,
                    whichever side won; he could wait. </p>
                <p> In this emergency McGaw again sought Crimmins's assistance. He urged the
                    importance of his getting the contract, and he promised to make Crimmins foreman
                    on the <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0181" n="160"/> street, and to give him a
                    share in the profits, if he would help him in some way to get the work now. The
                    first step, he argued, was the necessity of crushing Tom. Everything else would
                    be easy after that. Such a task, he felt, would not be altogether uncongenial to
                    Crimmins, still smarting under Tom's contemptuous treatment of him the day he
                    called upon her in his capacity of walking delegate. </p>
                <p> McGaw's tempting promise made a deep impression upon Crimmins. He determined
                    then and there to inflict some blow on Tom Grogan from which she could never
                    recover. He was equally determined on one other thing--not to be caught. </p>
                <p> Early the next morning Crimmins stationed himself outside O'Leary's where he
                    could get an uninterrupted view of two streets. He stood hunched up against the
                    jamb of O'Leary's door in the attitude of a corner loafer, with three parts of
                    his body touching the wood--hip, shoulder, and cheek. For some time no one
                    appeared in sight either useful or inimical to his plans, until Mr. James
                    Finnegan, who was filling the morning air with one of his characteristic <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0182" n="161"/> songs, brightened the horizon up the street to his left. </p>
                <p> Cully's unexpected appearance at that moment produced so uncomfortable an effect
                    upon Mr. Crimmins that that gentleman fell instantly back through the barroom
                    door. </p>
                <p> The boy's quick eye caught the movement, and it also caught a moment later, Mr.
                    Crimmins's nose and watery eye peering out again when their owner had assured
                    himself that his escape had been unseen. Cully slackened his pace to see what
                    new move Crimmins would make--but without the slightest sign of recognition on
                    his face--and again broke into song. He was on his way to get the mail, and had
                    passed McGaw's house but a few moments before, in the hope that that worthy
                    Knight might be either leaning over the fence or seated on the broken-down
                    porch. He was anxious McGaw should hear a few improvised stanzas of a new ballad
                    he had composed to that delightful old negro melody, "Massa's in de cold, cold
                    ground," in which the much-beloved Southern planter and the thoroughly hated
                    McGaw changed places in the cemetery. </p>
                <p> That valiant Knight was still in bed, <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0183" n="162"/>
                    exhausted by the labors of the previous evening. Young Billy, however, was about
                    the stables, and so Mr. James Finnegan took occasion to tarry long enough in the
                    road for the eldest son of his enemy to get the stanza by heart, in the hope
                    that he might retail it to his father when he appeared. </p>
                <p> Billy dropped his manure-fork as soon as Cully had moved on again, and dodging
                    behind the fence, followed him toward the post-office, hoping to hit the singer
                    with a stone. </p>
                <p> When the slinking body of McGaw's eldest son became visible to Mr. Crimmins, his
                    face broke into creases so nearly imitative of a smile that his best friend
                    would not have known him. He slapped the patched knees of his overalls gayly,
                    bent over in a subdued chuckle, and disported himself in a merry and much
                    satisfied way. His rum-and-watery eyes gleamed with delight, and even his
                    chin-whisker took on a new vibration. Next he laid one finger along his nose,
                    looked about him cautiously, and said to himself, in an undertone:-- </p>
                <p> "The very boy! It 'll fix McGaw dead to rights, an' ther' won't be no squealin'
                    after it 's done." </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0184" n="163"/>

                <p> Here he peered around the edge of one of O'Leary's drawn window-shades, and
                    waited until Cully had passed the barroom, secured his mail, and started for
                    home, his uninterrupted song filling the air. Then he opened the blind very
                    cautiously, and beckoned to Billy. </p>
                <p> Cully's eye caught the new movement as he turned the corner. His song ceased.
                    When Mr. Finnegan had anything very serious on his mind he never sang. </p>
                <p> When, some time after, Billy emerged from O'Leary's door, he had a two-dollar
                    bill tightly squeezed in his right hand. Part of this he spent on his way home
                    for a box of cigarettes; the balance he invested in a mysterious-looking tin
                    can. The can was narrow and long and had a screw nozzle at one end. This can
                    Cully saw him hide in a corner of his father's stable. </p>

                <head>XII<lb/> CULLY'S NIGHT OUT</head>
                <p> EVER since the night Cully, with the news of the hair-breadth escape of the bid,
                    had dashed back to Tom, waiting around the corner, he had been the hero of the
                    hour. As she listened to his description of McGaw when her bid dropped on the
                    table--" Lookin' like he 'd eat sumpin' he could n't swaller--see?" her face was
                    radiant, and her sides shook with laughter. She had counted upon McGaw falling
                    into her trap, and she was delighted over the success of her experiment. Tom had
                    once before caught him raising a bid when he discovered that but one had been
                    offered. </p>
                <p> In recognition of these valuable services Tom had given Cully two tickets for a
                    circus which was then charming the inhabitants of New Brighton, a mile or more
                    away, and he and Carl were going the following night. Mr. Finnegan was to wear a
                    black sack-coat, a <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0186" n="165"/> derby hat, and a
                    white shirt which Jennie, in the goodness of her heart, had ironed for him
                    herself. She had also ironed a scarf of Carl's, and had laid it on the
                    window-sill of the outer kitchen, where Cully might find it as he passed by. </p>
                <p> The walks home from church were now about the only chance the lovers had of
                    being together. Almost every day Carl was off with the teams. When he did come
                    home in working hours he would take his dinner with the men and boys in the
                    outer kitchen. Jennie sometimes waited on them, but he rarely spoke to her as
                    she passed in and out, except with his eyes. </p>
                <p> When Cully handed him the scarf, Carl had already dressed himself in his best
                    clothes, producing so marked a change in the outward appearance of the young
                    Swede that Cully in his admiration pronounced him "out o' sight." </p>
                <p> Cully's metamorphosis was even more complete than Carl's. Now that the warm
                    spring days were approaching, Mr. Finnegan had decided that his superabundant
                    locks were unseasonable, and had therefore had his hair cropped close to his
                    scalp, showing here and <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0187" n="166"/> there a white
                    scar, the record of some former scrimmage. Reaching to the edge of each ear was
                    a collar as stiff as pasteboard. His derby was tilted over his left eyebrow,
                    shading a face brimming over with fun and expectancy. Below this was a
                    vermilion-colored necktie and a black coat and trousers. His shoes sported three
                    coats of blacking, which only partly concealed the dust-marks of his profession. </p>
                <p> "Hully gee, Carl! but de circus's a-goin' ter be a dandy," he called out in
                    delight, as he patted a double shuffle with his feet. "I see de picters on de
                    fence when I come from de ferry. Dere 's a chariot-race out o' sight, an' a'
                    elephant what stands on 'is head. Hold on till I see ef de Big Gray 's got
                    enough beddin' under him. He wuz awful stiff dis mornin' when I helped him up."
                    Cully never went to bed without seeing the Gray first made comfortable for the
                    night. </p>
                <p> The two young fellows saw all the sights, and after filling their pockets with
                    peanuts and themselves with pink lemonade, took their seats at last under the
                    canvas roof, where they waited impatiently for the performance to begin. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0188" n="167"/>

                <p> The only departure from the ordinary routine was Cully's instant acceptance of
                    the clown's challenge to ride the trick mule, and his winning the wager amid the
                    plaudits of the audience, after a rough-and-tumble scramble in the sawdust,
                    sticking so tight to his back that a bystander remarked that the only way to get
                    the boy off would be to "peel the mule." </p>
                <p> When they returned it was nearly midnight. Cully had taken off his "choker," as
                    he called it, and had curled it outside his hat, They had walked over from the
                    show, and the tight clutch of the collar greatly interfered with Cully's
                    discussion of the wonderful things he had seen. Besides, the mule had ruined it
                    completely for a second use. </p>
                <p> It was a warm night for early spring, and Carl had his coat over his arm. When
                    they reached the outer stable fence--the one nearest the village--Cully's keen
                    nose scented a peculiar odor. "Who 's been a breakin' de lamp round here, Carl?"
                    he asked, sniffing close to the ground. "Holy smoke! Look at de light in de
                    stable--sumpin' mus' be de matter wid de Big Gray, or de ole woman would n't be
                    out dis time o' night wid a lamp. <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0189" n="168"/>
                    What would she be a-doin' out here, anyway?" he exclaimed in a sudden anxious
                    tone. "Dis ain't de road from de house. Hully gee! Look out for yer coat! De
                    rails is a-soakin' wid ker'sene! " </p>
                <p> At this moment a little flame shot out of the window over the Big Gray's head
                    and licked its way up the siding, followed by a column of smoke which burst
                    through the door in the hay-loft above the stalls of the three horses next the
                    bedroom of Carl and Cully. A window was hastily opened in Tom's house and a
                    frightened shriek broke the stillness of the night. It was Jennie's voice, and
                    it had a tone of something besides alarm. </p>
                <p> What the sight of the fire had paralyzed in Carl, the voice awoke. </p>
                <p> "No, no! I here--I safe, Jan!" he cried, clearing the fence with a bound. </p>
                <p> Cully did not hear Jennie. He saw only the curling flames over the Big Gray's
                    head. As he dashed down the slope he kept muttering the old horse's pet names,
                    catching his breath, and calling to Carl, "Save de Gray--save Ole Blowhard! " </p>
                <p> Cully reached the stable first, smashed the padlock with a shovel, and rushed
                    into the <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0190" n="169"/> Gray's stall. Carl seized a
                    horse-bucket, and began sousing the window-sills of the harness-room, where the
                    fire was hottest. </p>
                <p> By this time the whole house was aroused. Tom, dazed by the sudden awakening,
                    with her ulster thrown about her shoulders, stood barefooted on the porch.
                    Jennie was still at the window, sobbing as if her heart would break, now that
                    Carl was safe. Patsy had crawled out of his low crib by his mother's bed, and
                    was stumbling downstairs, one foot at a time. Twice had Cully tried to drag the
                    old horse clear of his stall, and twice had he fallen back for fresh air. Then
                    came a smothered cry from inside the blinding smoke, a burst of flame lighting
                    up the stable, and the Big Gray was pushed out, his head wrapped in Carl's coat,
                    the Swede pressing behind, Cully coaxing him on, his arms around the horse's
                    neck. </p>
                <p> Hardly had the Big Gray cleared the stable when the roof of the small extension
                    fell, and a great burst of flame shot up into the night air. All hope of
                    rescuing the other two horses was now gone. </p>
                <p> Tom did not stand long dazed and bewildered. In a twinkling she had drawn on <pb
                    entity="DSSR_000002229_0191" n="170"/> a pair of men's boots over her bare feet, buckled her ulster over
                    her night-dress, and rushed back upstairs to drag the blankets from the beds.
                    Laden with these she sprang down the steps, called to Jennie to follow, soaked
                    the bedding in the water-trough, and, picking up the dripping mass, carried it
                    to Carl and Cully, who, now that the Gray was safely tied to the kitchen porch,
                    were on the roof of the tool-house, fighting the sparks that fell on the
                    shingles. </p>
                <p> By this time the neighbors began to arrive from the tenements. Tom took charge
                    of every man as soon as he got his breath, stationed two at the pump-handle, and
                    formed a line of bucket-passers from the water-trough to Carl and Cully, who
                    were spreading the blankets on the roof. The heat now was terrific; Carl had to
                    shield his face with his sleeve as he threw the water. Cully lay flat on the
                    shingles, holding to the steaming blankets, and directing Carl's buckets with
                    his outstretched finger when some greater spark lodged and gained headway. If
                    they could keep these burning brands under until the heat had spent itself, they
                    could perhaps save the tool-house and the larger stable. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0192" n="171"/>

                <p> All this time Patsy had stood on the porch where Tom had left him hanging over
                    the railing wrapped in Jennie's shawl. He was not to move until she came for
                    him: she wanted him out of the way of trampling feet. Now and then she would
                    turn anxiously, catch sight of his wizened face dazed with fright, wave her hand
                    to him encouragingly, and work on. </p>
                <p> Suddenly the little fellow gave a cry of terror and slid from the porch,
                    trailing the shawl after him, his crutch jerking over the ground, his sobs
                    almost choking him. </p>
                <p> "Mammy! Cully! Stumpy 's tied in the loft! Oh, somebody help me! He 's in the
                    loft! Oh, please, please!" </p>
                <p> In the roar of the flames nobody heard him. The noise of axes beating down the
                    burning fences drowned all other sounds. At this moment Tom was standing on a
                    cart, passing up the buckets to Carl. Cully had crawled to the ridge-pole of the
                    tool-house to watch both sides of the threatened roof. </p>
                <p> The little cripple made his way slowly into the crowd nearest the sheltered side
                    of the tool-house, pulling at the men's coats, pleading with them to save his
                    goat, his Stumpy. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0193" n="172"/>

                <p> On this side was a door opening into a room where the chains were kept. From it
                    rose a short flight of six or seven steps leading to the loft. This loft had two
                    big doors--one closed, nearest the fire, and the other wide open, fronting the
                    house. When the roof of the burning stable fell, the wisps of straw in the
                    cracks of the closed door burst into flame. </p>
                <p> Within three feet of this blazing mass, shivering with fear, tugging at his
                    rope, his eyes bursting from his head, stood Stumpy, his piteous bleatings
                    unheard in the surrounding roar. A child's head appeared above the floor,
                    followed by a cry of joy as the boy flung himself upon the straining rope. The
                    next instant a half-frenzied goat sprang through the open door and landed in the
                    yard below in the midst of the startled men and women. </p>
                <p> Tom was on the cart when she saw this streak of light flash out of the darkness
                    of the loft door and disappear. Her eyes instinctively turned to look at Patsy
                    in his place on the porch. Then a cry of horror burst from the crowd, silenced
                    instantly as a piercing shriek filled the air. </p>
                <p> "My God! It 's me Patsy! " </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0194" n="173"/>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0195" n="174"/>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0196" n="175"/>

                <p> Bareheaded in the open doorway of the now blazing loft, a silhouette against the
                    flame, his little white gown reaching to his knees, his crutch gone, the
                    stifling smoke rolling out in great whirls above his head, stood the cripple! </p>
                <p> Tom hurled herself into the crowd, knocking the men out of her way, and ran
                    towards the chain room door. At this instant a man in his shirt-sleeves dropped
                    from the smoking roof, sprang in front of her, and caught her in his arms. </p>
                <p> "No, not you go; Carl go!" he said in a firm voice, holding her fast. </p>
                <p> Before she could speak he snatched a handkerchief from a woman's neck, plunged
                    it into the water of the horse-trough, bound it about his head, dashed up the
                    short flight of steps, and crawled toward the terror-stricken child. There was a
                    quick clutch, a bound back, and the smoke rolled over them, shutting man and
                    child from view. </p>
                <p> The crowd held their breath as it waited. A man with his hair singed and his
                    shirt on fire staggered from the side door. In his arms he carried the almost
                    lifeless boy, his face covered by the handkerchief. </p>
                <p> A woman rushed up, caught the boy in her <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0197"
                        n="176"/> arms, and sank on her knees. The man reeled and fell. </p>
                <p> When Carl regained consciousness, Jennie was bending over him, chafing his hands
                    and bathing his face. Patsy was on the sofa, wrapped in Jennie's shawl. Pop was
                    fanning him. Carl's wet handkerchief, the old man said, had kept the boy from
                    suffocating. </p>
                <p> The crowd had begun to disperse. The neighbors and strangers had gone their
                    several ways. The tenement-house mob were on the road to their beds. Many
                    friends had stopped to sympathize, and even the bitterest of Tom's enemies said
                    they were glad it was no worse. </p>
                <p> When the last of them had left the yard, Tom, tired out with anxiety and hard
                    work, threw herself down on the porch. The morning was already breaking, the
                    gray streaks of dawn brightening the east. From her seat she could hear through
                    the open door the soothing tones of Jennie's voice as she talked to her lover,
                    and the hoarse whispers of Carl in reply. He had recovered his breath again, and
                    was but little worse for his scorching, except in his speech. Jennie was in the
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0198" n="177"/> kitchen making some coffee for
                    the exhausted workers, and he was helping her. </p>
                <p> Tom realized fully all that had happened. She knew who had saved Patsy's life.
                    She remembered how he laid her boy in her arms, and she still saw the deathly
                    pallor in his face as he staggered and fell. What had he not done for her and
                    her household since he entered her service? If he loved Jennie, and she him, was
                    it his fault? Why did she rebel, and refuse this man a place in her home? Then
                    she thought of her own Tom no longer with her, and of her fight alone and
                    without him. What would he have thought of it? How would he have advised her to
                    act? He had always hoped such great things for Jennie. Would he now be willing
                    to give her to this stranger? If she could only talk to her Tom about it all! </p>
                <p> As she sat, her head in her hand, the smoking stable, the eager wild-eyed crowd,
                    the dead horses, faded away and became to her as a dream. She heard nothing but
                    the voice of Jennie and her lover, saw only the white face of her boy. A
                    sickening sense of utter loneliness swept over her. She rose and moved away. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0199" n="178"/>

                <p> During all this time Cully was watching the dying embers, and when all danger
                    was over,--only the small stable with its two horses had been destroyed,--he led
                    the Big Gray back to the pump, washed his head, sponging his eyes and mouth, and
                    housed him in the big stable. Then he vanished. </p>
                <p> Immediately on leaving the Big Gray, Cully had dodged behind the stable, run
                    rapidly up the hill, keeping close to the fence, and had come out behind a group
                    of scattering spectators. There he began a series of complicated manoeuvres,
                    mostly on his toes, lifting his head over those of the crowd, and ending in a
                    sudden dart forward and as sudden a halt, within a few inches of young Billy
                    McGaw's coat-collar. </p>
                <p> Billy turned pale, but held his ground. He felt sure Cully would not dare attack
                    him with so many others about. Then, again, the glow of the smouldering cinders
                    had a fascination for him that held him to the spot. </p>
                <p> Cully also seemed spellbound. The only view of the smoking ruins that satisfied
                    him seemed to be the one he caught over young McGaw's shoulder. He moved closer
                    and closer, sniffing about cautiously, as a dog <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0200"
                        n="179"/> would on a trail. Indeed, the closer he got to Billy's coat the
                    more absorbed he seemed to be in the view beyond. </p>
                <p> Here an extraordinary thing happened. There was a dipping of Cully's head
                    between Billy's legs, a raising of both arms, grabbing Billy around the waist,
                    and in a flash the hope of the house of McGaw was swept off his feet, Cully
                    beneath him, and in full run to-ward Tom's house. The bystanders laughed; they
                    thought it only a boyish trick. Billy kicked and struggled, but Cully held on.
                    When they were clear of the crowd, Cully shook him to the ground and grabbed him
                    by the coat-collar. </p>
                <p> "Say, young feller, where wuz ye when de fire started?" </p>
                <p> At this Billy broke into a howl, and one of the crowd, some distance off, looked
                    up. Cully clapped his hand over his mouth. "None o' that, or I 'll mash yer
                    mug--see?" standing over him with clenched fist. </p>
                <p> "I war n't nowheres," stammered Billy. "Say, take yer hands off 'n me--ye
                    ain't"-- </p>
                <p> "T'ell I ain't! Ye answer me straight--see?--or I 'll punch yer face in,"
                    tightening his grasp. "What wuz ye a-doin' when de <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0201" n="180"/> circus come out--an', anoder t'ing,
                    what 's dis cologne yer got on yer coat? Maybe next time ye climb a fence ye 'll
                    keep from spillin' it, see? Oh, I 'm onter ye. Ye set de stable afire. Dat's
                    what 's de matter." </p>
                <p> "I hope I may die--I wuz a-carryin' de can er ker'sene home, an' when de roof
                    fell in I wuz up on de fence so I c'u'd see de fire, an' de can slipped"-- </p>
                <p> "What fence!" said Cully, shaking him as a terrier would a rat. </p>
                <p> "Why dat fence on de hill." </p>
                <p> That was enough for Cully. He had his man. The lie had betrayed him. Without a
                    word he jerked the cowardly boy from the ground, and marched him straight into
                    the kitchen:-- </p>
                <p> "Say, Carl, I got de fire-bug. Ye kin smell der ker'sene on his clo'es." </p>

                <head>XIII<lb/> MR. QUIGG DRAWS A PLAN</head>
                <p> McGAW had watched the fire from his upper window with mingled joy and fear--joy
                    that Tom's property was on fire, and fear that it would be put out before she
                    would be ruined. He had been waiting all the evening for Crimmins, who had
                    failed to arrive. Billy had not been at home since supper, so he could get no
                    details as to the amount of the damage from that source. In this emergency he
                    sent next morning for Quigg to make a reconnaissance in the vicinity of the
                    enemy's camp, ascertain how badly Tom had been crippled, and learn whether her
                    loss would prevent her signing the contract the following night. Mr. Quigg
                    accepted the mission, the more willingly because he wanted to settle certain
                    affairs of his own. Jennie had avoided him lately,--why he could not tell,--and
                    he determined, before communicating to his employer the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0205" n="184"/> results of his inquiries about Tom,
                    to know exactly what his own chances were with the girl. He could slip over to
                    the house while Tom was in the city, and leave before she returned. </p>
                <p> On his way, the next day, he robbed a garden fence of a mass of lilacs, breaking
                    off the leaves as he walked. When he reached the door of the big stable he
                    stopped for a moment, glanced cautiously in to see if he could find any
                    preparations for the new work, and then, making a mental note of the
                    surroundings, followed the path to the porch. </p>
                <p> Pop opened the door. He knew Quigg only by sight--an unpleasant sight, he
                    thought, as he looked into his hesitating, wavering eyes. </p>
                <p> "It 's a bad fire ye had, Mr. Mullins," said Quigg, seating himself in the
                    rocker, the blossoms half strangled in his grasp. </p>
                <p> "Yis, purty bad, but small loss, thank God," said Pop quietly. </p>
                <p> "That lets her out of the contract, don't it?" said Quigg. "She 'll be short of
                    horses now." </p>
                <p> Pop made no answer. He did not intend <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0206" n="185"/>
                    to give Mr. Quigg any information that might comfort him. </p>
                <p> "Were ye insured?" asked Quigg, in a cautious tone, his eyes on the lilacs. </p>
                <p> "Oh, yis, ivery pinny on what was burned, so Mary tells me." </p>
                <p> Quigg caught his breath; the rumor in the village was the other way. Why did n't
                    Crimmins make a clean sweep of it and burn 'em all at once, he said to himself. </p>
                <p> "I brought some flowers over for Miss Jennie," said Quigg, regaining his
                    composure. "Is she in?" </p>
                <p> "Yis; I 'll call her." Gentle and apparently harmless as Gran'pop was, men like
                    Quigg somehow never looked him steadily in the eye. </p>
                <p> "I was tellin' Mr. Mullins I brought ye over some flowers," said Quigg, turning
                    to Jennie as she entered, and handing her the bunch without leaving his seat, as
                    if it had been a pair of shoes. </p>
                <p> "You 're very kind, Mr. Quigg," said the girl, laying them on the table, and
                    still standing. </p>
                <p> "I hear'd your brother Patsy was near smothered till Dutchy got him out. Was ye
                    there?" </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0207" n="186"/>

                <p> Jennie bit her lip and her heart quickened. Carl's sobriquet in the village,
                    coming from such lips, sent the hot blood to her cheeks. </p>
                <p> "Yes, Mr. Nilsson saved his life," she answered slowly, with girlish dignity, a
                    backward rush filling her heart as she remembered Carl staggering out of the
                    burning stable, Patsy held close to his breast. </p>
                <p> "The fellers in Rockville say ye think it was set afire. I see Justice Rowan
                    turned Billy McGaw loose. Do ye suspect anybody else? Some says a tramp crawled
                    in and upset his pipe." </p>
                <p> This lie was coined on the spot and issued immediately to see if it would pass. </p>
                <p> "Mother says she knows who did it, and it 'll all come out in time. Cully found
                    the can this morning," said Jennie, leaning against the table. </p>
                <p> Quigg's jaw fell and his brow knit as Jennie spoke. That was just like the fool,
                    he said to himself. Why did n't he get the stuff in a bottle and then break it? </p>
                <p> But the subject was too dangerous to linger over, so he began talking of the
                    dance down at the Town Hall, and the meeting last Sunday after church. He asked
                    her if she <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0208" n="187"/> would go with him to the
                    "sociable" they were going to have at No. 4 Truck-house; and when she said she
                    could n't,--that her mother did n't want her to go out, etc.,--Quigg moved his
                    chair closer, with the remark that the old woman was always putting her oar in
                    and spoiling things; the way she was going on with the Union would ruin her; she
                    'd better join in with the boys, and be friendly; they 'd "down her yet if she
                    did n't." </p>
                <p> "I hope nothing will happen to mother, Mr. Quigg," said Jennie, in an anxious
                    tone, as she sank into a chair. </p>
                <p> Quigg misunderstood the movement, and moved his own closer. </p>
                <p> "There won't nothin' happen any more, Jennie, if you 'll do as I say." </p>
                <p> It was the first time he had ever called her by her name. She could not
                    understand how he dared. She wished Carl would come in. </p>
                <p> "Will you do it?" asked Quigg eagerly, his cunning face and mean eyes turned
                    to-ward her. </p>
                <p> Jennie never raised her head. Her cheeks were burning. Quigg went on,-- </p>
                <p> "I 've been keepin' company with ye, Jennie, all winter, and the fellers is
                    guyin' me <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0209" n="188"/> about it. You know I 'm
                    solid with the Union and can help yer mother, and if ye 'll let me speak to
                    Father McCluskey next Sunday"-- </p>
                <p> The girl sprang from her chair. </p>
                <p> "I won't have you talk that way to me, Dennis Quigg! I never said a word to you,
                    and you know it." Her mother's spirit was now flashing in her eyes. "You ought
                    to be ashamed of yourself to come here--and"-- </p>
                <p> Then she broke down. </p>
                <p> Another woman would have managed it differently, perhaps,--by a laugh, a smile
                    of contempt, or a frigid refusal. This mere child, stung to the quick by Quigg's
                    insult, had only her tears in defense. The Walking Delegate turned his head and
                    looked out of the window. Then he caught up his hat and without a word to the
                    sobbing girl hastily left the room. </p>
                <p> Tom was just entering the lower gate. Quigg saw her and tried to dodge behind
                    the tool-house, but it was too late, so he faced her. Tom's keen eye caught the
                    sly movement and the quickly altered expression. Some new trickery was in the
                    air, she knew; she detected it in every line of Quigg's face. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0210" n="189"/> What was McGaw up to now? she asked
                    herself. Was he after Carl and the men, or getting ready to burn the other
                    stable? </p>
                <p> "Good-morning, Mr. Quigg. Ain't ye lost?" she asked coldly. </p>
                <p> "Oh no," said Quigg, with a forced laugh. "I come over to see if I could help
                    about the fire." </p>
                <p> It was the first thing that came into his head; he had hoped to pass with only a
                    nod of greeting. </p>
                <p> "Did ye.'" replied Tom thoughtfully. She saw he had lied, but she led him on.
                    "What kind of help did ye think of givin'? The insurance company will pay the
                    money, the two horses is buried, an' we begin diggin' post-holes for a new
                    stable in the mornin'. Perhaps ye were thinkin' of lendin' a hand yer-self. If
                    ye did, I can put ye alongside of Carl; one shovel might do for both of ye." </p>
                <p> Quigg colored and laughed uneasily. Somebody had told her, then, how Carl had
                    threatened him with uplifted shovel when he tried to coax the Swede away. </p>
                <p> "No, I 'm not diggin' these days; but I 've got a pull wid the insurance
                    adjuster, and might git an extra allowance for yer." This <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0211" n="190"/> was cut from whole cloth. He had
                    never known an adjuster in his life. </p>
                <p> "What 's that?" asked Tom, still looking square at him, Quigg squirming under
                    her glance like a worm on a pin. </p>
                <p> "Well, the company can't tell how much feed was in the bins, and tools, and sech
                    like," he said, with another laugh. </p>
                <p> A laugh is always a safe parry when a pair of clear gray search-light eyes are
                    cutting into one like a rapier. </p>
                <p> "An' yer idea is for me to git paid for stuff that was n't burned up, is it?" </p>
                <p> "Well, that 's as how the adjuster says. Sometimes he sees it an' sometimes he
                    don't--that 's where the pull comes in." </p>
                <p> Tom put her arms akimbo, her favorite attitude when her anger began to rise. </p>
                <p> "Oh I see! The pull is in bribin' the adjuster, as ye call him, so he can cheat
                    the company." </p>
                <p> Quigg shrugged his shoulders; that part of the transaction was a mere trifle.
                    What were companies made for but to be cheated? </p>
                <p> Tom stood for a minute looking him all over. </p>
                <p> "Dennis Quigg," she said slowly, weighing <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0212"
                        n="191"/> each word, her eyes riveted on his face, "ye 're a very sharp
                    young man; ye 're so very sharp that I wonder ye 've gone so long without
                    cuttin' yerself, But one thing I tell ye, an' that is, if ye keep on the way ye
                    're a-goin' ye 'll land where you belong, and that 's up the river in a
                    potato-bug suit of clothes. Turn yer head this way, Quigg. Did ye niver in yer
                    whole life think there was somethin' worth the havin' in bein' honest an' clean
                    an' square, an' holdin' yer head up like a man, instead of skulkin' round like a
                    thief? What ye 're up to this mornin' I don't know yet, but I want to tell ye it
                    's the wrong time o' day for ye to make calls, and the night 's not much better,
                    unless ye 're particularly invited." </p>
                <p> Quigg smothered a curse and turned on his heel toward the village. When he
                    reached O'Leary's, Dempsey of the Executive Committee met him at the door. He
                    and McGaw had spent the whole morning in devising plans to keep Tom out of the
                    board-room. </p>
                <p> Quigg's report was not reassuring. She would be paid her insurance money, he
                    said, and would certainly be at the meeting that night. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0213" n="192"/>

                <p> The three adjourned to the room over the bar. McGaw began pacing the floor, his
                    long arms hooked behind his back. He had passed a sleepless night, and every
                    hour now added to his anxiety. His face was a dull gray yellow, and his eyes
                    were sunken. Now and then he would tug at his collar nervously. As he walked he
                    clutched his fingers, burying the nails in the palms, the red hair on his wrists
                    bristling like spiders' legs. Dempsey sat at the table watching him calmly out
                    of the corner of his eye. </p>
                <p> After a pause Quigg leaned over, his lips close to Dempsey's ear. Then he drew a
                    plan on the back of an old wine-list. It marked the position of the door in
                    Tom's stable, and that of a path which ran across lots and was concealed from
                    her house by a low fence. Dempsey studied it a moment, nodding at Quigg's
                    whispered explanations, and passed it to McGaw, repeating Quigg's words. McGaw
                    stopped and bent his head. A dull gleam flashed out of his smouldering eyes. The
                    lines of his face hardened and his jaw tightened. For some minutes he stood
                    irresolute, gazing vacantly over the budding trees through the window. Then he
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0214" n="193"/> turned sharply, swallowed a
                    brimming glass of raw whiskey, and left the room. </p>
                <p> When the sound of his footsteps had died away, Dempsey looked at Quigg meaningly
                    and gave a low laugh. </p>
            </div1>

                <head>XIV<lb/> BLOSSOM-WEEK</head>
                <p> IT was "blossom-week," and every garden and hedge flaunted its bloom in the soft
                    air. All about was the perfume of flowers, the odor of fresh grass, and that
                    peculiar earthy smell of new-made garden beds but lately sprinkled. Behind the
                    hill overlooking the harbor the sun was just sinking into the sea. Some sentinel
                    cedars guarding its crest stood out in clear relief against the golden light.
                    About their tops, in wide circles, swooped a flock of crows. </p>
                <p> Gran'pop and Tom sat on the front porch, their chairs touching, his hand on
                    hers. She had been telling him of Quigg's visit that morning. She had changed
                    her dress for a new one. The dress was of brown cloth, and had been made in the
                    village--tight where it should be loose, and loose where it should be tight. She
                    had put it on, she told Pop, to <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0216" n="195"/> make
                    a creditable appearance before the board that night. </p>
                <p> Jennie was flitting in and out between the sitting-room and the garden, her
                    hands full of blossoms, filling the china jars on the mantel: none of them
                    contained Quigg's contribution. Patsy was flat on his back on the small patch of
                    green surrounding the porch, playing circus-elephant with Stumpy, who stood over
                    him with leveled head. </p>
                <p> Up the hill, but a few rods away, Cully was grazing the Big Gray--the old horse
                    munching tufts of fresh, sweet grass sprinkled with dandelions. Cully walked
                    beside him. Now and then he lifted one of his legs, examining the hoof
                    critically for possible tender places. </p>
                <p> There was nothing the matter with the Gray; the old horse was still sound: but
                    it satisfied Cully to be assured, and it satisfied, too, a certain yearning
                    tenderness in his heart toward his old chum. Once in a while he would pat the
                    Gray's neck, smoothing his ragged, half worn mane, addressing him all the while
                    in words of endearment expressed in a slang positively profane and utterly
                    without meaning except to these two. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0217" n="196"/>

                <p> Suddenly Jennie's cheek flushed as she came out on the porch. Carl was coming up
                    the path. The young Swede was bareheaded, the short blond curls glistening in
                    the light; his throat was bare too, so that one could see the big muscles in his
                    neck. Jennie always liked him with his throat bare; it reminded her of a hero
                    she had once seen in a play, who stormed a fort and rescued all the starving
                    women. </p>
                <p> "Da brown horse seek; batta come to stabble an' see him," Carl said, going
                    direct to the porch, where he stood in front of Tom, resting one hand on his
                    hip, his eyes never wandering from her face. He knew where Jennie was, but he
                    never looked. </p>
                <p> "What 's the matter with him?" asked Tom, her thoughts far away at the moment. </p>
                <p> "I don' know; he no eat da oats en da box." </p>
                <p> "Will he drink?" said Tom, awakening to the importance of the information. </p>
                <p> "Yas; 'mos' two buckets." </p>
                <p> "It 's fever he 's got," she said, turning to Pop. "I thought that yisterday
                    noon when I sees him a-workin'. All right, Carl; I 'll be down before I go to
                    the board meetin'. An' <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0218" n="197"/> see here,
                    Carl; ye'd better git ready to go wid me. I 'll start in a couple o' hours. Will
                    it suit ye, Gran'pop, if Carl goes with me?"--patting her father's shoulder. "If
                    ye keep on a-worritin' I 'll hev to hire a cop to follow me round." </p>
                <p> Carl lingered for a moment on the steps. Perhaps Tom had some further orders;
                    perhaps, too, Jennie would come out again. Involuntarily his eye wandered toward
                    the open door, and then he turned to go. Jennie's heart sprang up in her throat.
                    She had seen from behind the curtains the shade of disappointment that crossed
                    her lover's face. She could suffer herself, but she could not see Carl unhappy.
                    In an instant she was beside her mother. Anything to keep Carl--she did not care
                    what. </p>
                <p> "Oh, Carl, will you bring the ladder so I can reach the long branches?" she
                    said, her quick wit helping her with a subterfuge. </p>
                <p> Carl turned and glanced at Tom. He felt the look in her face and could read her
                    thoughts. </p>
                <p> If Tom had heard Jennie she never moved. This affair must end in some way, she
                    said to herself. Why had she not sent him away <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0219"
                        n="198"/> long before? How could she do it now when he had risked his life
                    to save Patsy? </p>
                <p> Then she answered firmly, still without turning her head, "No, Jennie; there
                    won't be time. Carl must get ready to"-- </p>
                <p> Pop laid his hand on hers. </p>
                <p> "There 's plinty o' toime, Mary. Ye 'll git the ladder behint the kitchen door,
                    Carl. I hed it ther' mesilf this mornin'." </p>
                <p> Carl found the ladder, steadied it against the tree, and guided Jennie's little
                    feet till they reached the topmost round, holding on to her skirts so that she
                    should not fall. Above their heads the branches twined and interlaced, shedding
                    their sweetest blossoms over their happy upturned faces. The old man's eyes
                    lightened as he watched them for some moments; then, turning to Tom, his voice
                    full of tenderness, he said:-- </p>
                <p> "Carl 's a foine lad, Mary; ye 'll do no better for Jinnie." </p>
                <p> Tom did not answer; her eyes were on the cedars where the crows were flying,
                    black silhouettes against the yellow sky. </p>
                <p> "Did I shtop ye an' break yer heart whin ye wint off wid yer own Tom? What wuz
                    he but an honest lad thet loved ye, an' he wid <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0220"
                        n="199"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0221" n="200"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0222" n="201"/> not a pinny in his pocket but the
                    fare that brought ye both to the new counthry." </p>
                <p> Tom's eyes filled. She could not see the cedars now. All the hill was swimming
                    in light. </p>
                <p> "Oi hev watched Carl sence he fust come, Mary. It's a good mither some'er's as
                    has lost a foine b'y. W'u'dn't ye be lonely yersilf ef ye'd come here wid nobody
                    to touch yer hand? " </p>
                <p> Tom shivered and covered her face. Who was more lonely than she--she who had
                    hungered for the same companionship that she was denying Jennie; she who had
                    longed for somebody to stand between her and the world, some hand to touch, some
                    arm to lean on; she who must play the man always--the man and the mother too! </p>
                <p> Pop went on, stroking her strong, firm hand with his stiff, shriveled fingers.
                    He never looked at her; his face was now too turned toward the dying sun. </p>
                <p> "Do ye remimber the day ye left me in the ould counthry, Mary, wid yer own Tom;
                    an' how I walked wid ye to the turnin' of the road? It wuz spring thin, an' the
                    hedges all white wid blossoms. Look at thim two over <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0223" n="202"/> there, Mary, wid their arms full o'
                    flowers. Don't be breakin' their hearts, child." </p>
                <p> Tom turned and slipped her arm around the old man's neck, her head sinking on
                    his shoulder. The tears were under her eyelids; her heart was bursting; only her
                    pride sustained her. Then in a half-whispered voice, like a child telling its
                    troubles, she said:-- </p>
                <p> "Ye don't know--ye don't know, Gran'pop. The dear God knows it 's not on account
                    of meself. It 's Tom I 'm thinkin' of night an' day--me Tom, me Tom. She 's his
                    child as well as mine. If he could only help me! He wanted such great things for
                    Jennie. It ud be easier if he had n't saved Patsy. Don't speak to me ag'in about
                    it, father dear; it hurts me." </p>
                <p> The old man rose from his chair and walked slowly into the house. All his talks
                    with his daughter ended in this way. It was always what Tom would have thought.
                    Why should a poor crazy cripple like her husband, shut up in an asylum, make
                    trouble for Jennie? </p>
                <p> When the light faded and the trees grew indistinct in the gloom, Tom still sat
                    where Pop had left her. Soon the shadows fell in the little valley, and the hill
                    beyond the <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0224" n="203"/> cedars lost itself in the
                    deepening haze that now crept in from the tranquil sea. </p>
                <p> Carl's voice calling to Cully to take in the Gray roused her to consciousness.
                    She pushed back her chair, stood for an instant watching Carl romping with
                    Patsy, and then walked slowly toward the stable. </p>
                <p> By the time she reached the water-trough her old manner had returned. Her step
                    became once more elastic and firm; her strong will asserted itself. She had work
                    to do, and at once. In two hours the board would meet. She needed all her
                    energies and resources. The lovers must wait; she could not decide any question
                    for them now. </p>
                <p> As she passed the stable window a man in a fur cap raised his head cautiously
                    above the low fence and shrank back into the shadow. </p>
                <p> Tom threw open the door and felt along the sill for the lantern and matches.
                    They were not in their accustomed place. The man crouched, ran noiselessly
                    toward the rear entrance, and crept in behind a stall. Tom laid her hand on the
                    haunches of the horse and began rolling back his blanket. The man drew himself
                    up slowly until his shoulders <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0225" n="204"/> were on
                    a level with the planking. Tom moved a step and turned her face. The man raised
                    his arm, whirled a hammer high in the air, and brought it down upon her head. </p>
                <p> When Cully led the Big Gray into his stall, a moment later, he stepped into a
                    pool of blood. </p>

                <head>XV<lb/> IN THE SHADOW OF DEATH</head>
                <p> AT the appointed hour the Board of Trustees met in the hall over the
                    post-office. The usual loungers filled the room--members of the Union, and
                    others who had counted on a piece of the highway pie when it was cut. Dempsey,
                    Crimmins, and Quigg sat outside the rail, against the wall. They were waiting
                    for McGaw, who had not been seen since the afternoon. </p>
                <p> The president was in his accustomed place. The five gentlemen of leisure, the
                    veterinary surgeon, and the other trustees occupied their several chairs. The
                    roll had been called, and every man had answered to his name. The occasion being
                    one of much importance, a full board was required. </p>
                <p> As the minute-hand neared the hour of nine Dempsey became uneasy. He started
                    every time a new-comer mounted the stairs. Where was McGaw? No one had seen him
                    since <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0227" n="206"/> he swallowed the tumblerful of
                    whiskey and disappeared from O'Leary's, a few hours before. </p>
                <p> The president rapped for order, and announced that the board was ready to sign
                    the contract with Thomas Grogan for the hauling and delivery of the broken stone
                    required for public highways. </p>
                <p> There was no response. </p>
                <p> "Is Mrs. Grogan here?" asked the president, looking over the room and waiting
                    for a reply. </p>
                <p> "Is any one here who represents her?" he repeated, after a pause, rising in his
                    seat as he spoke. </p>
                <p> No one answered. The only sound heard in the room was that of the heavy step of
                    a man mounting the stairs. </p>
                <p> "Is there any one here who can speak for Mrs. Thomas Grogan?" called the
                    president again, in a louder voice. </p>
                <p> "I can," said the man with the heavy tread, who proved to be the foreman at the
                    brewery. "She won't live till mornin'; one of her horses kicked her and broke
                    her skull, so McGaw told me." </p>
                <p> "Broke her skull! My God! man, how do <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0228" n="207"/>
                    you know?" demanded the president, his voice trembling with excitement. </p>
                <p> Every man's face was now turned toward the new-comer; a momentary thrill of
                    horror ran through the assemblage. </p>
                <p> "I heard it at the druggist's. One of her boys was over for medicine. Dr. Mason
                    sewed up her head. He was drivin' by, on his way to Quarantine, when it
                    happened." </p>
                <p> "What Dr. Mason?" asked a trustee, eager for details. </p>
                <p> "The man what used to be at Quarantine seven years ago. He 's app'inted ag'in." </p>
                <p> Dempsey caught up his hat and hurriedly left the room, followed by Quigg and
                    Crimmins. McGaw, he said to himself, as he ran downstairs, must be blind drunk,
                    not to come to the meeting. "----him! What if he gives everything away!" he
                    added aloud. </p>
                <p> "This news is awful," said the president. "I am very sorry for Mrs. Grogan and
                    her children--she was a fine woman. It is a serious matter, too, for the
                    village. The highway work ought to commence at once; the roads need it. We may
                    now have to advertise again. That would delay every-thing for a month." </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0229" n="208"/>

                <p> "Well, there 's other bids," said another trustee,--one of the gentlemen of
                    leisure,--ignoring the president's sympathy, and hopeful now of a possible slice
                    on his own account. "What 's the matter with McGaw's proposal? There 's not much
                    difference in the price. Perhaps he would come down to the Grogan figure. Is Mr.
                    McGaw here, or anybody who can speak for him?" </p>
                <p> Justice Rowan sat against the wall. The overzealous trustee had exactly
                    expressed his own wishes and anxieties. He wanted McGaw's chances settled at
                    once. If they failed, there was Rowan's own brother who might come in for the
                    work, the justice sharing of course in the profits. </p>
                <p> "In the absence of me client," said Rowan, looking about the room, and drawing
                    in his breath with an important air, "I suppose I can ripresint him. I think,
                    however, that if your honorable boord will go on with the other business before
                    you, Mr. McGaw will be on hand in half an hour himself. In the mean time I will
                    hunt him up." </p>
                <p> "I move," said the Scotch surgeon, in a voice that showed how deeply he had been
                    affected, "that the whole matter be laid on <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0230"
                        n="209"/> the table for a week, until we know for certain whether poor Mrs.
                    Grogan is killed or not. I can hardly credit it. It is very seldom that a horse
                    kicks a woman." </p>
                <p> Nobody having seconded this motion, the chair did not put it. The fact was that
                    every man was afraid to move. The majority of the trustees, who favored McGaw,
                    were in the dark as to what effect Tom's death would have upon the bids. The law
                    might require readvertising and hence a new competition, and perhaps somebody
                    much worse for them than Tom might turn up and take the work--somebody living
                    outside of the village. Then none of them would get a finger in the pie. Worse
                    than all, the cutting of it might have to be referred to the corporation
                    counsel, Judge Bowker. What his opinion would be was past finding out. He was
                    beyond the reach of "pulls," and followed the law to the letter. </p>
                <p> The minority--a minority of two, the president and the veterinary surgeon--began
                    to distrust the spirit of McGaw's adherents. It looked to the president as if a
                    "deal" were in the air. </p>
                <p> The Scotchman, practical, sober-minded, <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0231" n="210"
                    /> sensible man as he was, had old-fashioned ideas of honesty and fair play. He
                    had liked Tom from the first time he saw her,--he had looked after her stables
                    professionally,--and he did not intend to see her, dead or alive, thrown out,
                    without making a fight for her. </p>
                <p> "I move," said he, "that the president appoint a committee of this board to jump
                    into the nearest wagon, drive to Mrs. Grogan's, and find out whether she is
                    still alive. If she 's dead, that settles it; but if she 's alive, I will
                    protest against anything being done about this matter for ten days. It won't
                    take twenty minutes to find out; mean-time we can take up the unfinished
                    business of the last meeting." </p>
                <p> One of the gentlemen of leisure seconded this motion; it was carried
                    unanimously, and this gentleman of leisure was himself appointed courier and
                    left the room in a hurry. He had hardly reached the street when he was back
                    again, followed closely by Dempsey, Quigg, Crimmins, Justice Rowan, and, last of
                    all, fumbling with his fur cap, deathly pale, and entirely sober--Dan McGaw. </p>
                <p> "There's no use of my going," said the <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0232" n="211"
                    /> courier trustee, taking his seat. "Grogan won't live an hour, if she ain't
                    dead now. She had a sick horse that wanted looking after, and she went into the
                    stable without a light, and he let drive, and broke her skull. She 's got a gash
                    the length of your hand--was n't that it, Mr. McGaw.'" </p>
                <p> McGaw nodded his head. </p>
                <p> "Yes; that 's about it," he said. The voice seemed to come from his stomach, it
                    was so hollow. </p>
                <p> "Did you see her, Mr. McGaw?" asked the Scotchman in a positive tone. </p>
                <p> "How c'u'd I be a-seein' her whin I been in New Yorruk 'mos' all day? D' ye
                    think I 'm runnin' roun' to ivery stable in the place? I wuz a-comin' 'cross
                    lots whin I heared it. They says the horse had blin' staggers." </p>
                <p> "How do you know, then?" asked the Scotchman suspiciously. "Who told you the
                    horse kicked her? " </p>
                <p> "Well, I dunno; I think it wuz some un"-- </p>
                <p> Dempsey looked at him and knit his brow. McGaw stopped. </p>
                <p> "Don't you know enough of a horse to know he could n't kick with blind
                    staggers?" insisted the Scotchman. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0233" n="212"/>

                <p> McGaw did not answer. </p>
                <p> "Does anybody know any of the facts connected with this dreadful accident to
                    Mrs. Grogan?" asked the president. "Have you heard anything, Mr. Quigg!" </p>
                <p> Mr. Quigg had heard absolutely nothing, and had not seen Mrs. Grogan for months.
                    Mr. Crimmins was equally ignorant, and so were several other gentlemen. Here a
                    voice came from the back of the room. </p>
                <p> "I met Dr. Mason, sir, an hour ago, after he had attended Tom Grogan. He was on
                    his way to Quarantine in his buggy. He said he left her insensible after
                    dressin' the wound. He thought she might not live till mornin'." </p>
                <p> "May I ask your name, sir?" asked the president in a courteous tone. </p>
                <p> "Peter Lathers. I am yardmaster at the U. S. Lighthouse Depot." </p>
                <p> The title, and the calm way in which Lathers spoke, convinced the president and
                    the room. Everybody realized that Tom's life hung by a thread. The Scotchman
                    still had a lingering doubt. He also wished to clear up the blind-staggers
                    theory. </p>
                <p> "Did he say how she was hurt?" asked the Scotchman. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0234" n="213"/>

                <p> "Yes. He said he was a-drivin' by when they picked her up, and he was dead sure
                    that somebody had hid in the stable and knocked her on the head with a club." </p>
                <p> McGaw steadied himself with his hand and grasped the seat of his chair. The
                    sweat was rolling from his face. He seemed afraid to look up, lest some other
                    eye might catch his own and read his thoughts. If he had only seen Lathers come
                    in! </p>
                <p> Lathers's announcement, coupled with the Scotchman's well-known knowledge of
                    equine diseases discrediting the blind-staggers theory, produced a profound
                    sensation. Heads were put together, and low whispers were heard. Dempsey, Quigg,
                    and Crimmins did not move a muscle. </p>
                <p> The Scotchman again broke the silence. </p>
                <p> "There seems to be no question, gentlemen, that the poor woman is badly hurt;
                    but she is still alive, and while she breathes we have no right to take this
                    work from her. It 's not decent to serve a woman so; and I think, too, it 's
                    illegal. I again move that the whole matter be laid upon the table," </p>
                <p> This motion was not put, nobody seconding it. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0235" n="214"/>

                <p> Then Justice Rowan rose. The speech of the justice was seasoned with a brogue as
                    delicate in flavor as the garlic in a Spanish salad. </p>
                <p> "Mr. Prisident and Gintlemen of the Honorable Boord of Village Trustees," said
                    the justice, throwing back his coat. The elaborate opening compelled attention
                    at once. Such courtesies were too seldom heard in their deliberations, thought
                    the members, as they lay back in their chairs to listen. </p>
                <p> "No wan can be moore pained than meself that so estimable a woman as Mrs.
                    Grogan--a woman who fills so honorably her every station in life--should at this
                    moment be stricken down either by the hand of an assassin or the hoof of a
                    horse. Such acts in a law-abidin' community like Rockville bring with them the
                    deepest detistation and the profoundest sympathy. No wan, I am sure, is more
                    touched by her misforchune than me worthy friend Mr. Daniel McGaw, who by this
                    direct interposition of Providence is foorced into the position of being
                    compelled to assert his rights befoore your honorable body, with full assurance
                    that there is no tribunal in the land to which he could apply which would lend a
                    more willing ear." </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0236" n="215"/>

                <p> It was this sort of thing that made Rowan popular. </p>
                <p> "But, gintlemen,"--here the justice curry-combed his front hair with his
                    fingers--greasy, jet-black hair, worn long, as befitted his position,--"this is
                    not a question of sympathy, but a question of law. Your honorable boord
                    advertoised some time since for certain supplies needed for the growth and
                    development of this most important of the villages of Staten Island. In this
                    call it was most positively and clearly stated that the contract was to be
                    awarded to the lowest risponsible bidder who gave the proper bonds. Two
                    risponses were made to this call, wan by Mrs. Grogan, acting on behalf of her
                    husband,--well known to be a hopeless cripple in wan of the many charitable
                    institootions of our noble State,--and the other by our distinguished
                    fellow-townsman, Mr. Daniel McGaw, whom I have the honor to ripresint. With that
                    strict sinse of justice which has always characterized the decisions of this
                    honorable boord, the contract was promptly awarded to Thomas Grogan, he being
                    the lowest bidder; and my client, Daniel McGaw,--honest Daniel McGaw I should
                    call him <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0237" n="216"/> if his presence did not
                    deter me,--stood wan side in obadience to the will of the people and the laws of
                    the State, and accepted his defate with that calmness which always distinguishes
                    the hard-workin' sons of toil, who are not only the bone and sinoo of our land,
                    but its honor and proide. But, gintlemen,"--running his hand lightly through his
                    hair, and then laying it in the bulging lapels of his now half-buttoned coat,--"
                    there were other conditions accompanying these proposals; to wit, that within
                    tin days from said openin' the successful bidder should appear befoore this
                    honorable body, and then and there duly affix his signatoor to the aforesaid
                    contracts, already prepared by the attorney of this boord, my honored associate,
                    Judge Bowker. Now, gintlemen, I ask you to look at the clock, whose calm face,
                    like a rising moon, presides over the deliberations of this boord, and note the
                    passin' hour; and then I ask you to cast your eyes over this vast assemblage and
                    see if Thomas Grogan, or any wan ripresinting him or her, or who in any way is
                    connected with him or her, is within the confines of this noble hall, to execute
                    the mandates of this distinguished boord. Can it <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0238" n="217"/>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0239" n="218"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0240" n="219"/> be believed for an instant that if
                    Mrs. Grogan, acting for her partly dismimbered husband, Mr. Thomas Grogan, had
                    intinded to sign this contract, she would not have dispatched on the wings of
                    the wind some Mercury, fleet of foot, to infarm this boord of her desire for
                    postponement? I demand in the interests of justice that the contract be awarded
                    to the lowest risponsible bidder who is ready to sign the contract with proper
                    bonds, whether that bidder is Grogan, McGaw, Jones, Robinson, or Smith." </p>
                <p> There was a burst of applause and great stamping of feet; the tide of sympathy
                    had changed. Rowan had perhaps won a few more votes. This pleased him evidently
                    more than his hope of cutting the contract pie. McGaw began to regain some of
                    his color and lose some of his nervousness. Rowan's speech had quieted him. </p>
                <p> The president gravely rapped for order. It was wonderful how much backbone and
                    dignity and self-respect the justice's very flattering remarks had injected into
                    the nine trustees--no, eight, for the Scotchman fully understood and despised
                    Rowan's oratorical powers. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0241" n="220"/>

                <p> The Scotchman was on his feet in an instant. </p>
                <p> "I have listened," he said, "to the talk that Justice Rowan has given us. It 's
                    very fine and tonguey, but it smothers up the facts. You can't rob this woman"-- </p>
                <p> "Question! question!" came from half a dozen throats. </p>
                <p> "What 's your pleasure, gentlemen?" asked the president, pounding with his
                    gavel. </p>
                <p> "I move," said the courier member, "that the contract be awarded to Mr. Daniel
                    McGaw as the lowest bidder, provided he can sign the contract to-night with
                    proper bonds." </p>
                <p> Four members seconded it. </p>
                <p> "Is Mr. McGaw's bondsman present?" asked the president, rising. </p>
                <p> Justice Rowan rose, and bowed with the air of a foreign banker accepting a
                    government loan. </p>
                <p> "I have that honor, Mr. Prisident. I am willing to back Mr. McGaw to the extent
                    of me humble possissions, which are ample, I trust, for the purposes of this
                    contract"--looking around with an air of entire confidence. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0242" n="221"/>

                <p> "Gentlemen, are you ready for the question?" asked the president. </p>
                <p> At this instant there was a slight commotion at the end of the hall. Half a
                    dozen men nearest the door left their seats and crowded to the top of the
                    staircase. Then came a voice outside: "Fall back; don't block up the door! Get
                    back there!" The excitement was so great that the proceedings of the board were
                    stopped. </p>
                <p> The throng parted, The men near the table stood still. An ominous silence
                    suddenly prevailed. Daniel McGaw twisted his head, turned ghastly white, and
                    would have fallen from his chair but for Dempsey. </p>
                <p> Advancing through the door with slow, measured tread, her long cloak reaching to
                    her feet; erect, calm, fearless; her face like chalk; her lips compressed,
                    stifling the agony of every step; her eyes deep sunken, black-rimmed, burning
                    like coals; her brow bound with a blood-stained handkerchief that barely hid the
                    bandages beneath, came Tom. </p>
                <p> The deathly hush was unbroken. The men fell back with white, scared faces to let
                    her pass. McGaw cowered in his chair. Dempsey's eyes glistened, a half-sigh of
                    relief <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0243" n="222"/> escaping him. Crimmins had not
                    moved; the apparition stunned him. </p>
                <p> On she came, her eyes fixed on the president, till she reached the table. Then
                    she steadied herself for a moment, took a roll of papers from her dress, and
                    sank into a chair. </p>
                <p> No one spoke. The crowd pressed closer. Those outside the rail noiselessly
                    mounted the benches and chairs, craning their necks. Every eye was fixed upon
                    her. </p>
                <p> Slowly and carefully she unrolled the contract, spreading it out before her,
                    picked up a pen from the table, and without a word wrote her name. Then she rose
                    firmly, and walked steadily to the door. </p>
                <p> Just then a man entered within the rail and took her seat. It was her bondsman,
                    Mr. Crane. </p>

                <head>XVI<lb/> A FRIEND IN NEED</head>
                <p> TWO days after Tom had signed the highway contract, Babcock sat in his private
                    office in New York, opening his mail. In the outside room were half a dozen
                    employees--engineers and others--awaiting their instructions. </p>
                <p> The fine spring weather had come and work had been started in every direction,
                    including the second section of the sea-wall at the depot, where the divers were
                    preparing the bottom for the layers of concrete. Tom's carts had hauled the
                    stone. </p>
                <p> Tucked into the pile of letters heaped before him, Babcock's quick eye caught
                    the corner of a telegram. It read as follows:-- </p>
                <p> Mother hurt, Wants you immediately. Please come. JENNIE GROGAN. </p>
                <p> For an instant he sat motionless, gazing at the yellow slip. Then he sprang to
                    his feet. <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0245" n="224"/> Thrusting his unopened
                    correspondence into his pocket, he gave a few hurried instructions to his men
                    and started for the ferry. Once on the boat, he began pacing the deck. "Tom
                    hurt!" he repeated to himself. "Tom hurt? How--when--what could have hurt her?"
                    He had seen her at the sea-wall, only three days before, rosy-cheeked,
                    magnificent in health and strength. What had happened? At the St. George landing
                    he jumped into a hack, hurrying the cabman. </p>
                <p> Jennie was watching for him at the garden gate. She said her mother was in the
                    sitting-room, and Gran'pop was with her. As they walked up the path she
                    recounted rapidly the events of the past two days. </p>
                <p> Tom was on the lounge by the window, under the flowering plants, when Babcock
                    entered. She was apparently asleep. Across her forehead, covering the temples,
                    two narrow bandages bound up her wound. At Babcock's step she opened her eyes,
                    her bruised, discolored face breaking into a smile. Then, noting his evident
                    anxiety, she threw the shawl from her shoulders and sat up. </p>
                <p> "No, don't look so. It 's nothin'; I 'll be all right in a day or two. I 've
                    been hurted <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0246" n="225"/> before, but not so bad as
                    this. I wouldn't have troubled ye, but Mr. Crane has gone West. It was kind and
                    friendly o' ye to come; I knew ye would." </p>
                <p> Babcock nodded to Pop, and sank into a chair. The shock of her appearance had
                    completely unnerved him. </p>
                <p> "Jennie has told me about it," he said in a tender, sympathetic tone. "Who was
                    mean enough to serve you in this way, Tom?" He called her Tom now, as the others
                    did. </p>
                <p> "Well, I won't say now. It may have been the horse, but I hardly think it, for I
                    saw a face. All I remember clear is a-layin' me hand on the mare's back. When I
                    come to I was flat on the lounge. They had fixed me up, and Dr. Mason had gone
                    off. Only the thick hood saved me. Carl and Cully searched the place, but
                    nothin' could be found. Cully says he heard somebody a-runnin' on the other side
                    of the fence, but ye can't tell. Nobody keeps their heads in times like that." </p>
                <p> "Have you been in bed ever since?" Babcock asked. </p>
                <p> "In bed! God rest ye! I was down to the board meetin' two hours after, wid Mr.
                    Crane, <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0247" n="226"/> and signed the contract.
                    Jennie and all of 'em would n't have it, and cried and went on, but I braved 'em
                    all. I knew I had to go if I died for it. Mr. Crane had his buggy, so I didn't
                    have to walk. The stairs was the worst. Once inside, I was all right. I only had
                    to sign, an' come out again; it did n't take a minute. Mr. Crane stayed and
                    fixed the bonds wid the trustees, an' I come home wid Carl and Jennie." Then,
                    turning to her father, she said, "Gran'pop, will ye and Jennie go into the
                    kitchen for a while? I 've some private business wid Mr. Babcock." </p>
                <p> When they were gone her whole manner changed. She buried her face for a moment
                    in the pillow, covering her cheek with her hands; then, turning to Babcock, she
                    said:-- </p>
                <p> "Now, me friend, will ye lock the door?" </p>
                <p> For some minutes she looked out of the window, through the curtains and
                    nasturtiums, then, in a low, broken voice, she said: </p>
                <p> "I 'm in great trouble. Will ye help me?" </p>
                <p> "Help you, Tom? You know I will, and with anything I 've got. What is it!" he
                    said earnestly, regaining his chair and drawing it closer. </p>
                <p> "Has no one iver told ye about me Tom?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0248" n="227"
                    /> she asked, looking at him from under her eyebrows. "No; except that he was
                    hurt or--or--out of his mind, maybe, and you could n't bring him home." </p>
                <p> "An' ye have heared nothin' more?" </p>
                <p> "No," said Babcock, wondering at her anxious manner. </p>
                <p> "Ye know that since he went away I 've done the work meself, standin' out as he
                    would have done in the cold an' wet an' workin' for the children wid nobody to
                    help me but these two hands." </p>
                <p> Babcock nodded. He knew how true it was. </p>
                <p> "Ye 've wondered many a time, maybe, that I niver brought him home an' had him
                    round wid me other poor cripple, Patsy--them two togither." Her voice fell
                    almost to a whisper. </p>
                <p> "Or ye thought, maybe, it was mean and cruel in me that I kep' him a burden on
                    the State, when I was able to care for him me-self. Well, ye 'll think so no
                    more." </p>

                <p> Babcock began to see now why he had been sent for. His heart went out to her all
                    the more. </p>
                <p> "Tom, is your husband dead?" he asked, with a quiver in his voice. </p>
                <p> She never took her eyes from his face. Few people were ever tender with her;
                    they never seemed to think she needed it. She read this man's sincerity and
                    sympathy in his eyes; then she answered slowly:-- </p>
                <p> "He is, Mr. Babcock." </p>
                <p> "When did he die! Was it last night, Tom? " </p>
                <p> "Listen to me fust, an' then I 'll tell ye. Ye must know that when me Tom was
                    hurted, seven years ago, we had a small place, an' only three horses, and them
                    war n't paid for; an' we had the haulin' at the brewery, an' that was about all
                    we did have. When Tom had been sick a month--it was the time the bucket fell an'
                    broke his rib--the new contract at the brewery was let for the year, an'
                    Schwartz give it to us, a-thinkin' that Tom 'd be round ag'in, an' niver carin',
                    so 's his work was done, an' I doin' it, me bein' bigan strong, as I always was.
                    Me Tom got worse an' worse, an' I saw him a-failin', an' one day Dr. Mason
                    stopped an' said if I brought him to Bellevue Hospital, where he had just been
                    appointed, he 'd fix up his rib so he could <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0250"
                        n="229"/> breathe easier, and maybe he 'd get well. Well, I hung on an' on,
                    thinkin' he 'd get better,--poor fellow, he did n't want to go,--but one night,
                    about dark, I took the Big Gray an' put him to the cart, an' bedded it down wid
                    straw; an' I wrapped me Tom up in two blankits an' carried him downstairs in me
                    own arms, an' driv slow to the ferry." </p>
                <p> She hesitated for a moment, leaned her bruised head on her hand, and then went
                    on:-- </p>
                <p> "When I got to Bellevue, over by the river, it was near ten o'clock at night.
                    Nobody stopped me or iver looked into me bundle of straw where me poor boy lay;
                    an' I rung the bell, an' they came out, an' got him up into the ward, an' laid
                    him on the bed. Dr. Mason was on night duty, an' come an' looked at him, an'
                    said I must come over the next day; an' I kissed me poor Tom an' left him tucked
                    in, promisin' to be back early in the mornin'. I had got only as far as the gate
                    on the street whin one of the men came a-runnin' after me. I thought he had
                    fainted, and ran back as fast as I could, but when I got me arms under him
                    again--he was dead." </p>
                <p> "And all this seven years ago, Tom?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0251" n="230"/>
                    said Babcock in astonishment, sinking back in his chair. </p>
                <p> Tom bowed her head. The tears were trickling through her fingers and falling on
                    the coarse shawl. </p>
                <p> "Yis; seven years ago this June." She paused for a moment, as if the scene was
                    passing before her in every detail, and then went on: "Whin I come home I niver
                    said a word to anybody but Jennie. I 've niver told Pop yit. Nobody else would
                    have cared; we was strangers here. The next mornin' I took Jennie,--she was a
                    child then,--an' we wint over to the city, an' I got what money I had, an' the
                    doctors helped, an' we buried him; nobody but just us two, Jennie an' me,
                    walkin' behint the wagon, his poor body in the box. Whin I come home I wanted to
                    die, but I said nothin'. I was afraid Schwartz would take the work away if he
                    knew it was only a woman who was a-doin' it wid no man round, an so I kep' on;
                    an' whin the neighbors asked about him bein' in a 'sylum an' out of his head,
                    an' a cripple an' all that, God forgive me, I was afraid to tell, and I kept
                    still and let it go at that; an' whin they asked me how he was I 'd say he <pb
                       entity="DSSR_000002229_0252" n="231"/>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0253" n="232"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0254" n="233"/> was better, or more comfortable, or
                    easier; an' so he was, thank God! bein' in heaven." </p>
                <p> She roused herself wearily, and wiped her eyes with the back of her hand.
                    Babcock sat motionless. </p>
                <p> "Since that I 've kep' the promise to me Tom that I made on me knees beside his
                    bed the night I lifted him in me arms to take him downstairs--that I 'd keep his
                    name clean, and do by it as he would hev done himself, an' bring up the
                    children, an' hold the roof over their heads. An' now they say I dar' n't be
                    called by Tom's name, nor sign it neither, an' they 're a-goin' to take me
                    contract away for puttin' his name at the bottom of it, just as I 've put it on
                    ivery other bit o' paper I 've touched ink to these seven years since he left
                    me." </p>
                <p> "Why, Tom, this is nonsense. Who says so?" said Babcock earnestly, glad of any
                    change of feeling to break the current of her thoughts. </p>
                <p> "Dan McGaw an' Rowan says so." </p>
                <p> "What 's McGaw got to do with it? He 's out of the fight." </p>
                <p> "Oh, ye don't know some men, Mr. Babcock. McGaw 'll never stop fightin' while I
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0255" n="234"/> live. Maybe I ought n't tell
                    ye,--I 've niver told anybody,--but whin my Tom lay sick upstairs, McGaw come in
                    one night, an' his own wife half dead with a blow he had given her, an' sat down
                    in this very room,--it was our kitchen then,--an' he says, ' If your man don't
                    git well, ye 'll be broke.' An' I says to him, 'Dan McGaw, if I live twelve
                    months, Tom Grogan 'll be a richer man than he is now.' I was a-sittin' right
                    here when I said it, wid a rag carpet on this floor, an' hardly any furniture in
                    the room. He said more things, an' tried to make love to me, and I let drive and
                    threw him out of me kitchen. Then all me trouble wid him began; he 's done
                    everything to beat me since, and now maybe, after all, he 'll down me. It all
                    come up yisterday through McGaw meetin' Dr. Mason an' askin' him about me Tom;
                    an' whin the doctor told him Tom was dead seven years, McGaw runs to Justice
                    Rowan wid the story, an' now they say I can't sign a dead man's name. Judge
                    Bowker has the papers, an' it's all to be settled to-morrow." </p>
                <p> "But they can't take your contract away," said Babcock indignantly, "no matter
                    what Rowan says." </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0256" n="235"/>

                <p> "Oh, it 's not that--it 's not that. That 's not what hurts me. I can git
                    another contract. That's not what breaks me heart. But if they take me Tom's <hi
                        rend="italic">name</hi> from me, an' say I can't be Tom Grogan any more; its
                    like robbin' me of my life. When I work on the docks I allus brace myself an'
                    say 'I'm doing just what Tom did many a day for me.' When I sign his name to me
                    checks an' papers,--the name I 've loved an' that I 've worked for, the name I
                    've kep' clean for him--me Tom that loved me, an' never lied or was mean--me Tom
                    that I promised, an'--an'"-- </p>
                <p> All the woman in her overcame her now. Sinking to her knees, she threw her arms
                    and head on the lounge, and burst into tears. </p>
                <p> Babcock rested his head on his hand, and looked on in silence. Here was
                    something, it seemed to him, too sacred for him to touch even with his sympathy. </p>
                <p> "Tom," he said, when she grew more quiet, his whole heart going out to her,
                    "what do you want me to do?" </p>
                <p> "I don't know that ye can do anything," she said in a quivering voice, lifting
                    her head, her eyes still wet. "Perhaps nobody can. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0257" n="236"/> But I thought maybe ye 'd go wid me
                    to Judge Bowker in the mornin', Rowan an' all of 'em 'll be there, an' I 'm no
                    match for these lawyers. Perhaps ye 'd speak to the judge for me." </p>
                <p> Babcock held out his hand. </p>
                <p> "I knew ye would, an' I thank ye," she said, drying her eyes. "Now unlock the
                    door, an' let 'em in. They worry so. Gran'pop has n't slep' a night since I was
                    hurted, an' Jennie goes round cryin' all the time, sayin' they 'll be a-killin'
                    me next." </p>
                <p> Then, rising to her feet, she called out in a cheery voice, as Babcock opened
                    the door, "Come in, Jennie; come in Gran'pop. It's all over, child. Mr. Babcock
                    's a-going wid me in the mornin'. Niver fear; we'll down 'em all yit." </p>

                <head>XVII<lb/> A DANIEL COME TO JUDGMENT</head>
                <p> WHEN Judge Bowker entered his office adjoining the village bank, Justice Rowan
                    had already arrived. So had McGaw, Dempsey, Crimmins, Quigg, the president of
                    the board, and one or two of the trustees. The judge had sent for McGaw and the
                    president, and they had notified the others. </p>
                <p> McGaw sat next to Dempsey. His extreme nervousness of a few days ago--starting
                    almost at the sound of his own footstep--had given place to a certain air of
                    bravado, now that everybody in the village believed the horse had kicked Tom. </p>
                <p> Babcock and Tom were by the window, she listless and weary, he alert and
                    watchful for the slightest point in her favor. She had on her brown dress,
                    washed clean of the blood-stains, and the silk hood, which better concealed the
                    bruises. All her old fire and energy were gone. It was not from the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0259" n="238"/> shock of her wound,--her splendid
                    constitution was fast healing that,--but from this deeper hurt, this last thrust
                    of McGaw's which seemed to have broken her indomitable spirit. </p>
                <p> Babcock, although he did not betray his misgivings, was greatly worried over the
                    outcome of McGaw's latest scheme. He wished in his secret heart that Tom had
                    signed her own name to the contract. He was afraid so punctilious a man as the
                    judge might decide against her. He had never seen him; he only knew that no
                    other judge in his district had so great a reputation for technical rulings. </p>
                <p> When the judge entered--a small, gray-haired, keen-eyed man in a black suit,
                    with gold spectacles, spotless linen, and clean-shaven face--Babcock's fears
                    were confirmed. This man, he felt, would be legally exact, no matter who
                    suffered by his decision. </p>
                <p> Rowan opened the case, the judge listening attentively, looking over his
                    glasses. Rowan recounted the details of the advertisement, the opening of the
                    bids, the award of the contract, the signing of "Thomas Grogan" in the presence
                    of the full board, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0260" n="239"/> the discovery
                    by his "honored client that no such man existed, had not existed for years, and
                    did not now exist." </p>
                <p> "Dead, your Honor "--throwing out his chest impressively, his voice
                    swelling--"dead in his grave these siven years, this <hi rend="italic">Mr</hi>.
                    Thomas Grogan; and yet this woman has the bald and impudent effrontery to"-- </p>
                <p> "That will do, Mr. Rowan." </p>
                <p> Police justices--justices like Rowan--did not count much with Judge Bowker, and
                    then he never permitted any one to abuse a woman in his presence. </p>
                <p> "The point you make is that Mrs. Grogan had no right to sign her name to a
                    contract made out in the name of her dead husband." </p>
                <p> "I do, your Honor," said Rowan, resuming his seat. </p>
                <p> "Why did you sign it?" asked Judge Bowker, turning to Tom. </p>
                <p> She looked at Babcock. He nodded assent, and then she answered:-- </p>
                <p> "I allus signed it so since he left me." </p>
                <p> There was a pleading, tender pathos in her words that startled Babcock. He could
                    hardly believe the voice to be Tom's. </p>
                <p> The judge looked at her with a quick, penetrating <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0261" n="240"/> glance, which broadened into an
                    expression of kindly interest when he read her entire honesty in her face. Then
                    he turned to the president of the board. </p>
                <p> "When you awarded this contract, whom did you expect to do the work, Mrs. Grogan
                    or her husband.' " </p>
                <p> "Mrs. Grogan, of course. She has done her own work for years," answered the
                    president. </p>
                <p> The judge tapped the arm of his chair with his pencil. The taps could be heard
                    all over the room. Most men kept quiet in Bowker's presence, even men like
                    Rowan. For some moments his Honor bent over the desk and carefully examined the
                    signed contract spread out before him; then he pushed it back, and glanced about
                    the room. </p>
                <p> "Is Mr. Crane, the bondsman, present?" </p>
                <p> "Mr. Crane has gone West, sir," said Babcock, rising. "I represent Mrs. Grogan
                    in this matter." </p>
                <p> "Did Mr. Crane sign this bond knowing that Mrs. Grogan would haul the stone?" </p>
                <p> "He did; and I can add that all her checks, receipts, and correspondence are
                    signed in the same way, and have been for years. She <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002229_0262" n="241"/> is known everywhere as Tom Grogan.
                    She has never had any other name--in her business." </p>
                <p> "Who else objects to this award?" said the judge calmly. </p>
                <p> Rowan sprang to his feet. The judge looked at him. </p>
                <p> "Please sit down, Justice Rowan. I said 'who <hi rend="italic">else</hi>.' I
                    have heard you." He knew Rowan. </p>
                <p> Dempsey jumped from his chair. </p>
                <p> "I 'm opposed to it, yer Honor, an' so is all me fri'nds here. This woman has
                    been invited into the Union, and treats us as if we was dogs. She"-- </p>
                <p> "Are you a bidder for this work?" asked the judge. </p>
                <p> "No, sir; but the Union has rights, and"-- </p>
                <p> "Please take your seat; only bidders can be heard now." </p>
                <p> "But who 's to stand up for the rights of the laborin' man if"-- </p>
                <p> "You can, if you choose; but not here. This is a question of evidence." </p>
                <p> "Who 's Bowker anyhow?" said Dempsey behind his hand to Quigg. "Ridin' 'round in
                    his carriage and chokin' off free speech?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0263"
                        n="242"/> After some moments of thought the judge turned to the president of
                    the board, and said in a measured, deliberate voice:-- </p>
                <p> "This signature, in my opinion, is a proper one. No fraud is charged, and under
                    the testimony none was intended. The law gives Mrs. Grogan the right to use any
                    title she chooses in conducting her business--her husband's name, or any other.
                    The contract must stand as it is." </p>
                <p> Here the judge arose and entered his private office, shutting the door behind
                    him. </p>
                <p> Tom had listened with eyes dilating, every nerve in her body at highest tension.
                    Her contempt for Rowan in his abuse of her; her anger against Dempsey at his
                    insults; her gratitude to Babcock as he stood up to defend her; her fears for
                    the outcome, as she listened to the calm, judicial voice of the judge,--each
                    producing a different sensation of heat and cold,--were all forgotten in the
                    wild rush of joy that surged through her as the judge's words fell upon her ear,
                    She shed no tears, as other women might have done. Every fibre of her being
                    seemed to be turned to steel. She was herself again--she, Tom Grogan!--firm on
                    her own feet, <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0264" n="243"/> with her big arms ready
                    to obey her, and her head as clear as a bell, master of herself, master of her
                    rights, master of everything about her. And, above all, master of the dear name
                    of her Tom that nothing could take from her now--not even the law! </p>
                <p> With this tightening of her will power there quivered through her a sense of her
                    own wrongs--the wrongs she had endured for years, the wrongs that had so nearly
                    wrecked her life. </p>
                <p> Then, forgetting the office, the still solemnity of the place--even Babcock--she
                    walked straight up to McGaw, blocking his exit to the street door. </p>
                <p> "Dan McGaw, there 's a word I 've got for ye before ye l'ave this place, an' I
                    'm a-going to say it to ye now before ivery man in this room." </p>
                <p> McGaw shrank back in alarm. </p>
                <p> "You an' I have known each other since the time I nursed yer wife when yer boy
                    Jack was born, an' helped her through when she was near dyin' from a kick ye
                    give her. Ye began yer dirty work on me one night when me Tom lay sick, an' I
                    threw ye out o' me kitchen; an' since that time ye 've"-- </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0265" n="244"/>

                <p> "Here! I ain't a-goin' ter stand here an' listen ter yer. Git out o' me way, or
                    I 'll"-- </p>
                <p> Tom stepped closer, her eyes flashing, every word ringing clear. </p>
                <p> "Stand still, an' hear what I 've got to say to ye, or I 'll go into that room
                    and make a statement to the judge that 'll put ye where ye won't move for years.
                    There was enough light for me to see. Look at this "--drawing back her hood, and
                    showing the bandaged scar. </p>
                <p> McGaw seemed to shrivel up; the crowd stood still in amazement. </p>
                <p> "I thought ye would. Now, I 'll go on. Since that night in me kitchen ye 've
                    tried to ruin me in ivery other way ye could. Ye 've set these dead beats
                    Crimmins and Quigg on to me to coax away me men; ye 've stirred up the Union; ye
                    burned me stable"-- </p>
                <p> "Ye lie! It 's a tramp did it," snarled McGaw. </p>
                <p> "Ye better keep still till I get through, Dan McGaw. I 've got the can that helt
                    the ker'sene, an' I know where yer boy Billy bought it, an' who set him up to
                    it," she added, looking straight at Crimmins. "He might 'a' been a dacent boy
                    but for him." Crimmins turned pale and bit his lip. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0266" n="245"/>

                <p> The situation became intense, Even the judge, who had come out of his private
                    room at the attack, listened eagerly. </p>
                <p> "Ye 've been a sneak an' a coward to serve a woman so who never harmed ye. Now I
                    give ye fair warnin', an' I want two or three other men in this room to listen;
                    if this don't stop, ye 'll all be behint bars where ye belong.--I mean you, too,
                    Mr. Dempsey. As for you, Dan McGaw, if it war n't for yer wife Kate, who 's a
                    dacent woman, ye 'd go <hi rend="italic">to-day</hi>. Now, one thing more, an' I
                    'll let ye go. I 've bought yer chattel mortgage of Mr. Crane that 's past due,
                    an' I can do wid it as I pl'ase. You 'll send to me in the mornin' two of yer
                    horses to take the places of those ye burned up, an' if they 're not in my
                    stable by siven o'clock I 'll be round yer way 'bout nine with the sheriff." </p>
                <p> Once outside in the sunlight, she became herself again. The outburst had cleared
                    her soul like a thunder-clap, She felt as free as air. The secret that had
                    weighed her down for years was off her mind. What she had whispered to her own
                    heart she could now proclaim from the housetops. Even the law protected her. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0267" n="246"/>

                <p> Babcock walked beside her, silent and grave. She seemed to him like some Joan
                    with flaming sword. </p>
                <p> When they reached the road that led to her own house, her eyes fell upon Jennie
                    and Carl. They had walked down behind them, and were waiting under the trees. </p>
                <p> "There 's one thing more ye can do for me, my friend," she said, turning to
                    Babcock. "All the old things Tom an' I did togither I can do by meself; but it
                    's new things like Carl an' Jennie that trouble me--the new things I can't ask
                    him about. Do ye see them two yonder! Am I free to do for 'em as I would? No; ye
                    need n't answer. I see it in yer face. Come here, child; I want ye. Give me yer
                    hand." </p>
                <p> For an instant she stood looking into their faces, her eyes brimming. Then she
                    took Jennie's hand, slipped it into Carl's, and laying her big, strong palm over
                    the two, said slowly: </p>
                <p> "Now go home, both o' ye, to the house that 'll shelter ye, pl'ase God, as long
                    as ye live." </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002229_0268" n="247"/>

                <p> BEFORE the highway-work was finished, McGaw was dead and Billy and Crimmins in
                    Sing Sing. The label on the empty can, Quigg's volunteered testimony, and Judge
                    Bowker's charge, convinced the jury. Quigg had quarreled with Crimmins and the
                    committee, and took that way of getting even. </p>
                <p> When Tom heard the news, she left her teams standing in the road and went
                    straight to McGaw's house. His widow sat on a broken chair in an almost empty
                    room. </p>
                <p> "Don't cry, Katy," said Tom, bending over her. "I 'm sorry for Billy. Seems to
                    me, ye 've had a lot o' trouble since Dan was drowned. It was not all Billy's
                    fault. It was Crimmins that put him up to it. But ye 've one thing left, and
                    that 's yer boy Jack. Let me take him--I 'll make a man of him." </p>
                <p> Jack is still with her. Tom says he is the best man in her gang. </p>
