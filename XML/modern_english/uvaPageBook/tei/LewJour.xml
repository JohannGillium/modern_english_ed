  <p>1815.  NOVEMBER 8. <hi rend="italic"> (Wednesday.) </hi>

<p>   
I LEFT London, and reached Gravesend at nine in the morning,   
having been taught to expect our sailing in a few hours. But   although the vessel left the Docks on Saturday, she did not   

reach this place till three o'clock on Thursday the 9th. The   
Captain now-tells me, that we may expect to sail certainly in the   
afternoon of to-morrow the 10th. I expect the ship's cabin to   
gain greatly by my two days' residence at the "***** ****,"   
which nothing can exceed for noise, dirt, and dulness. Eloisa   
would never have established "black melancholy,"-at the Paraclete    
as its favourite residence, if she had happened to pass three   
days at an inn at Gravesend: nowhere else did I ever see the   
Sky look so dingy, and the river so dirty: to be sure, the place   
has all the advantages of an English November to assist it in those   
particulars. Just now, too, a carriage passed my windows, conveying    
on board a cargo of passengers, who seemed sincerely   
afflicted at the thoughts of leaving their dear native land! The   
pigs squeaked, the ducks quacked, and the fowls screamed; and   
all so dolefully, as clearly to prove, that <hi rend="italic">theirs</hi> was no dissembled   
sorrow! And after them (more affecting than all) came a   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0021" n="2"/>
   
wheelbarrow, with a solitary porker tied in a basket, with his    
head hanging over on one side, and his legs sticking out on the   
other, who neither grunted nor moved, nor gave any signs of   
life, but seemed to be of quite the same opinion with Hannah   
More's heroine,   
  
<q>"Grief is for <hi rend="italic">little</hi> wrongs; despair for mine!"</q>   
  
As Miss O'Neil is to play "Elwina" for the first time to-morrow, it is a thousand pities that she had not the previous   
advantage of seeing the speechless despondency of this poor pig;   
it might have furnished her with some valuable hints, and enabled   
her to convey more perfectly to the audience the "expressive   
silence" of irremediable distress.

At four o'clock in the afternoon, I embarked on board the   
"Sir Godfrey Webster," Captain Boyes. On approaching the   
vessel, we heard the loudest of all possible shrieks proceeding   
from a boat lying near her: and who should prove to be the   
complainant, but my former acquaintance, the despairing pig.  
He had recovered his voice to protest against entering the ship:   
I had already declared against climbing up the accommodation   
ladder; the pig had precisely the very same objection. So a   
<hi rend="italic">soi-disant</hi> chair, being a broken bucket, was let down for us, and   
the pig and myself entered the vessel by the same conveyance;    
only pig had the precedence, and was hoisted up first. The   
ship proceeded three miles, and then the darkness obliged us to   
come to an anchor. There are only two other cabin passengers,   
a Mr. J&mdash; A and a Mr. S&mdash;; the latter is a planter in   
the "May-Day Mountains," Jamaica: he wonders, considering   
how much benefit Great Britain derives from the West Indies,   
that government is not careful to build more churches in them,  
and is of opinion, that "hedicating the negroes is the only way   
to make them appy; indeed, in his umble hopinion, hedication   
his hall in hall!"

<p>We sailed at six o'clock, passed through "Nob's Hole," the   
"Girdler's Hole," and "the Pan" (all very dangerous sands,   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0022" n="3"/>
   
and particularly the last, where at times we had only one foot   
water below us), by half-past four, and at five came to an anchor   
in the Queen's Channel. Never having seen any thing of the   
kind before, I was wonderfully pleased with the manoeuvring of   
several large ships, which passed through the sands at the same   
time with us: their motions seemed to be effected with as much   
ease and dexterity as if they had been crane-necked, carriages;   
and the effect as they pursued each other's track and windings   
was perfectly beautiful.

<p> The wind was contrary, and we had to beat up the whole way.   
We did not reach the Downs till past four o'clock, and, as there   
were above sixty vessels arrived before us, we had some difficulty   
in finding a safe berth. At length we anchored in the Lower   
Roads, about four miles off Deal. We can see very clearly the   
double lights in the vessel moored off the Goodwin sands: it is   
constantly inhabited by two families, who reside there alternately   
every fortnight, except when the weather delays the exchange.   
The "Sir Godfrey Webster" is a vessel of 600 tons, and was   
formerly in the East India service. I have a very clean cabin,   
a place for my books, and every thing is much more comfortable   
than I expected; the wind, however, is completely west, the   
worst that we could have, and we must not even expect a change   
till the full moon. The captain pointed out a man to me today, who   
had been with him in a violent storm off the Bermudas.   
For six hours together, the flashes of lightning were so unintermitting    
that the eye could not sustain them: at one time, the   
ship seemed to be completely in a blaze; and the man in question   
(who was then standing at the wheel, near the captain) suddenly cried out,   
"I don't know what has happened to me, but I can neither see nor stand ;"   
and he fell down upon the deck. He was taken up and carried below;   
and it appeared that the lightning had affected his eyes and legs, in a   
degree to make him both blind and lame, though the captain, who was standing   
by his side had received no injury: in three or four days the   
man was quite well again.    
</p>   
<p>In this storm no less than thirteen vessels were dismasted, or otherwise shattered by the  
lightning.

<p>At six this morning came on a tremendous gale of wind; the   
captain says, that he never experienced a heavier. However,   
we rode it out with great success, although, at one time, it was   
bawled out that we were driving; and, at another, a brig which   
lay near us broke from her moorings, and came bearing down   
close upon us. The danger, indeed, from the difference of size,   
was all upon the side of the brig; but, luckily, the vessels   
cleared each other. This evening she has thought it as well to   
remove further from so dangerous a neighbourhood. There is a   
little cabin-boy on board, and Mr. J&mdash; has brought with   
him a black terrier; and these two at first sight swore to each    
other an eternal friendship, in the true German style. It is the   
boy's first voyage, and he is excessively sea-sick; so he has been   
obliged to creep into his hammock, and his friend, the little   
black terrier, has crept into the hammock with him. A boat   
came from the shore this evening, and reported that several vessels    
have been dismasted, lost their anchors, and injured in various    
ways. A brig, which was obliged to make for Ramsgate,   
missed the pier, and was dashed to pieces completely; the crew,   
however, were saved, all except the pilot; who, although he was   
brought on shore alive, what between bruises, drowning, and   
fright, had suffered so much that he died two hours afterwards.   
The weather has now again become calm; but the wind is still   
full west.   
   
</p>   
</div1>  
<div1 type="section" id="d13">

<p>The wind altered sufficiently to allow us to escape from the   
Downs; and at dusk we were off Beachy Head. This morning   
the steward left the trap-door of the store-hole open; of course,   
I immediately contrived to step into it, and was on the point of   
being precipitated to the bottom, among innumerable boxes of   
grocery, bags of biscuit, and porter barrels;-where a broken   
limb was the <hi rend="italic">least</hi> that I could expect. Luckily I fell across   
the corner of the trap, and managed to support myself, till I  
could effect my escape with a bruised knee, and the loss of a few   
inches of skin from my left arm.

<p>At one this morning a violent gust of wind came on; and, at   
the rate of ten miles an hour, carried us through the Chops of  
the Channel, formed by the Scilly Rocks and the Isle of Ushant.   
But I thought that the advance was dearly purchased by the   
terrible night which the storm made us pass. The wind roaring,    
the waves dashing against the stern, till at last they beat in   
the quarter gallery; the ship, too, rolling from side to side, as if   
every moment she were going to roll over and over! Mr. J&mdash;  
was heaved off one of the sofas, and rolled along, till   
he was stopped by the table. He then took his seat upon the   
floor, as the more secure position; and, half an hour afterwards,   
another heave chucked him back again upon the sofa. The   
captain snuffed out one of the candles, and both being tied to the   
table, could not relight it with the other: so the steward came   
to do it; when a sudden heel of the ship made him extinguish   
the second candle, tumbled him upon the sofa on which I was   
lying, and made the candle which he had brought with him fly   
out of the candlestick, through a cabin window at his elbow;   
and thus we were all left in the dark. Then the intolerable   
noise! The cracking of bulk-heads! the sawing of ropes! the   
screeching of the tiller! the trampling of the sailors! the clattering

all in motion at once! Chairs, writing-desks, books, boxes,  
bundles, fire-irons and fenders, flying to one end of the room;   
and the next moment (as if they had made a mistake) flying   
back again to the other with the same hurry and confusion!  
"Confusion worse confounded!" Of all the inconveniences   
attached to a vessel, the incessant noise appears to me the most   
insupportable! As to our live stock, they seem to have made up   
their minds on the subject, and say with one of Ariosto's knights   
(when he was cloven from the head to the chine)," <hi rend="italic">"or convien

last by dozens; and by Tuesday morning it is supposed that we   
shall not have an animal alive in the ship, except the black   
terrier-and my friend the squeaking pig, whose vocal powers   
are still audible, maugre the storm and the sailors, and who (I   
believe) only continues to survive out of spite, because he

<p>Our live stock has received an increase; our fowls and ducks   
are dead to be sure, but a lark flew on board this morning, blown   
(as is supposed) from the coast of France. In five minutes it   
appeared to be quite at home, ate very readily whatever was   
given it, and hopped about the deck without fear of the sailors,   
or the more formidable black terrier, with all the ease and assurance    
imaginable.

<p>The weather continues intolerable.  Boisterous waves running

storms by night, which prevent our getting any sleep.

doubt the truth of the proverb, "Many things fall out between

<p>A complete and most violent storm, from twelve at night till   
seven the next morning. The fore-top-sail, though only put up   
for the first time yesterday, was rent from top to bottom; and   
several of the other sails are torn to pieces. The perpetual   
tempestuous weather which we have experienced has so shaken   
the, planks of the vessel, that the sea enters at all quarters.   
About one o'clock in the morning I was saluted by a stream of   
water, which poured down exactly upon my face, and obliged   
me to shift my lodgings. The carpenter had been made aware   
that there was a leak in my cabin, and ordered to caulk the   
seam; but, I suppose, he thought that during only a two months'   
voyage, the rain might very possibly never find out the hole,   
and that it would be quite time enough to apply the remedy   
when I should have felt the inconvenience. The best is, that   
the carpenter happening to be at work in the next cabin when   
the water came down upon me, I desired him to call my servant,   
in order that I might get up on account of the leak; on which   
he told me "that the leak could not be helped;" grumbled a   
good deal at calling up the servant; and seemed to think me   
not a little unreasonable for not lying quietly, and suffering my   
self to be pumped upon by this shower-bath of his own providing.   
  
</p><p> But if the water gets <hi rend="italic">into</hi> the ship, on the other hand, last   
night the poor old steward was very near getting out of it.   
In the thick of the storm he was carrying some grog to the   
mate, when a gun, which drove against him, threw him off his   
balance, and he was just passing through one of the port-holes,   
when, luckily, he caught hold of a rope, and saved himself. A   
screech-owl flew on board this morning: I am sure we have no   
need of birds of ill omen; I could supply the place of a whole   
aviary of them myself.

<p>The wind continues contrary, and the weather is as disagreeable   
and perverse as it can well be; indeed, I understand that   
in these latitudes nothing can be expected but heavy gales or   
dead calms, which makes them particularly pleasant for sailing,   
especially as the calms are by far the most disagreeable of the two:   
the wind steadies the ship; but when she creeps as slowly as she   
does at present (scarcely going a mile in four hours), she feels   
the whole effect of the sea breaking against her, and rolls backwards    
and forwards with every billow as it rises and falls. In the   
meanwhile, everything seems to be in a state of the most active   
motion, except the ship; while we are carrying a spoonful of   
soup to our mouths, the remainder takes the "glorious golden   
opportunity" to empty itself into our laps, and the glasses and   
salt-cellars carry on a perpetual domestic warfare during the   
whole time of dinner, like the Guelphs and the Ghibellines.   
Nothing is so common as to see a roast goose suddenly jump out   
of its dish in the middle of dinner, and make a frisk from one   
end of the table to the other; and we are quite in the habit of   
laying wagers which of the two boiled fowls will arrive at the   
bottom first.   
</p><p>N.B. To-day the fowl without the liver wing was the favourite,

<p>I had no idea of the expense of building and preserving a   
ship. That in which I am at present cost 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at its outset.   
Last year the repairs amounted to 14,000<hi rend="italic">1</hi>.; and in a voyage to   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0028" n="9"/>
   
the East Indies they were more than 20,000<hi rend="italic">1</hi>. In its return last   
year from Jamaica it was on the very brink of shipwreck. A   
storm had driven it into Bantry Bay, and there was no other   
refuge from the winds than Bear Haven, whose entrance was   
narrow and difficult; however, a gentleman from Castletown   
came on board, and very obligingly offered to pilot the ship.   
He was one of the first people in the place, had been the owner   
of a vessel himself, was most thoroughly acquainted with every   
of the haven, &amp;e. &amp;c., and so on they went. There was   
one sunken rock, and that about ten feet in diameter; the   
knew it, and warned his gentleman-pilot to keep a little   
to the eastward. " My dear friend," answered the Irish   
"now do just make yourself asy; I know well enough   
what we are about; we are as clear of the rock as if we were in   
Sea, by Jasus;"-upon which the vessel struck upon   
and there she struck. The captain fell to swearing and   
is hair. " G-d-you, sir! didn't I tell you to keep   
Dam'me ,  she's on the rock!"" Oh! well, my   
Dear, she now  <hi rend="italic"> on </hi>  the rock, and, in a few minutes, you know,   
why she'll be  <hi rend="italic"> off </hi>  the rock: to be sure, I'd have taken my oath   
that the rock was two hundred and fifty feet on the other side   
of her, but&mdash;"-"Two hundred and fifty feet! why, the   
channel is not two hundred and fifty feet wide itself! and as to   
getting her off, bumping up against this rock, it can only be with a   
great hole in her side."-" Poh ! now, bother, my dear! why   
sure-"-" Leave the ship, sir; dam'me, sir, get out of my   
ship this moment! " Instead of which, with the most smiling   
and obliging air in the world, the Irishman turned to console   
the female passengers. " Make yourselves  <hi rend="italic"> asy </hi> , ladies, pray make   
yourself perfectly  <hi rend="italic"> asy </hi> ; but, upon my soul, I believe your captain's   
mad ; no danger in life! only   
make yourselves  <hi rend="italic"> asy </hi> , I say ;   
for the ship lies on the rock as safe and as quiet, by Jasus, as if   
she were lying on a mud bank! " Luckily the weather was so   
perfectly calm, that the ship having once touched the rock with   
her keel bumped. no more. It was low water; she wanted but   
five inches to float her, and when the tide rose she drifted off',   
and with but little harm done. The gentleman-pilot then   
thought proper to return on shore, took a very polite leave of   
the lady passengers, and departed with all the urbanity possible;   
   
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0029" n="10"/>
   
only thinking the captain the strangest person that he had ever

be put out of temper by such a trifle.

Yesterday we had the satisfaction of falling in with the trade   
wind, and now we are proceeding both rapidly and steadily.,   
The change of climate is very perceptible ; and the deep and   
beautiful blue which colours the sea is a certain intimation of our   
approach to the tropic. A few flying-fish have made their appearance;    
and the. spears are being put in order for the reception    
of their constant attendant, the dolphin. These spears have   
ropes affixed to them,. and at one end of the pole are five barbs,   
at the other a heavy ball of lead: then, when the fish is speared,   
the striker lets the staff fall, on which down goes the lead into   
the sea, and up goes the dolphin into the air, who is in the   
utmost astonishment to find itself all of a sudden turned into a   
flying-fish ; so determines to cultivate the art of flying for the   
future, and promises itself a great many pleasant airings. The   
dolphin and the flying-fish are beautifully colored, and both are   
very good food, particularly the latter, which move in shoals   
like the herring, and are about the size of that fish. They are   
supposed to feed on spawn and sea animalcul2e, and will not take   
the bait; but on the shores of Barbadoes, which they frequent   
in great multitudes, they are caught in wide nets, spread upon   
the surface of the sea; then, upon beating the waters around,   
the fish rise in clouds, and fly till, their fins getting dry, they fall   
down into the nets which have been spread to receive them. The   
dolphin is seldom above three feet long; the immense strength   
which he exerts in his struggles for liberty occasions the necessity   
of catching him with the spear in the way before described.

At three o'clock this afternoon we entered the tropic of    
Cancer ; and if the wind continues tolerably favourable, , we   
expect to see Antigua on Sunday se'nnight. On crossing   
line, it was formerly usual for ships to receive a visit from an   
old gentleman and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Cancer: the husband   
was, by profession, a barber; and, probably, the scullion, who   
   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0030" n="11"/>
   
insisted. so peremptorily on shaving Sancho, at the duke's castle,   
had served an apprenticeship to Mr. Cancer, for their mode of   
proceeding was, much alike, and, indeed, very peculiar : the old   
gentleman always made a point of using a rusty iron hoop instead   
of a razor, tar for soap, and an empty beef-barrel was, in his   
opinion, the very best possible substitute for a basin; in consequence    
of which, instead of paying him for shaving them, people   
of taste were disposed to pay for not being shaved , and as Mrs.   
Cancer happened to be particularly partial to gin, the gift of a   
few bottles was generally successful in rescuing the donor's chin   
from the hands of her husband ; however, to-day this venerable   
pair "perdventure were sleeping or on a journey," for we   
neither saw nor heard anything about them.

A dead centipes was found on the deck, supposed to have mad   
its way on board during the last voyage, among the logwood.   
This is not the only species of disagreeable passengers who are   
in the habit of introducing themselves into homeward-bound   
vessels without leave. While sleeping on deck last year the captain    
felt something run across his face, and supposing it to be a   
cockroach, he brushed off a scorpion; but not without its firs   
biting him upon the cheek: the pain for about four hours was   
excessive; but although he did no more than wash the wound   
with spirits, he was perfectly well again in a couple of days.

Since we entered the tropic the rains have been incessant and   
most violent; but the wind was brisk and favourable, and w,   
rapidly. Now we have lost the trade-wind, and move   
that it might almost be called standing still. On the   
other hand, the weather is now perfectly delicious; the ship   
makes, but little way, but she moves steadily; the sun is brilliant,    
the sky cloudless, the sea calm, and so smooth, that it looks   
like one extended sheet of blue glass; an awning is stretched   
over the deck ; although there is not wind enough to fill the   
there is sufficient to keep the air cool, and thus, even during    
the day, the weather is very pleasant: but the nights are   
quite heavenly, and so bright, that at ten o'clock yesterday evening

little Jem. Parsons (the cabin-boy), and his friend the black   
terrier, came on deck, and sat themselves down on a gun-carriage,   
to read by the light of the moon. I looked at the boy's book   
(the terrier, I suppose, read over the other's shoulder), and found   
that it was  'The Sorrows of Werter.' I asked who had lent   
him such a book, and whether it amused him? He said that it   
had been made a present to him, and so he had read it almost   
through,, for he had got to Werter's dying; though to be sure   
he did not understand it all, nor like very much what he under   
stood ; for he thought the man a great fool for killing himself   
for love. I told him I thought every man a great fool who   
killed himself for love or for anything else : but had lie no b9oks   
but 'The Sorrows of Werter?' -Oh, dear, yes, he said, he had   
a great many more; he had got I The Adventures of a Louse,'   
which was a very curious book, indeed ; and he bad got besides,   
'The Recess,' and 'Valentine and Orson,' and 'Roslin Castle,'   
and a book of Prayers, just like the Bible; but he could Dot but   
that he liked I The Adventures of a Louse' the best of any   
of them.

We caught a dolphin, but not with the spear: he gorged a   
line which was fastened to the stern and baited with salt pork;   
but being a very large and strong fish, his efforts to escape were   
so powerful, that it was feared he would break the line, and a   
 <hi rend="italic"> grainse  </hi> (as the dolphin-spear is technically termed) was thrown   
at him : he was struck, and three of the prongs were buried in   
his side ; yet with a violent effort be forced them out again, and   
threw the lance up into the air. I am not much used to take   
pleasure in the sight of animal suffering, but if Pythagoras him   
self bad been present, and "of opinion that the soul of his.   
grandam might haply inhabit" this dolphin, I think he must   
still have admired the force and agility displayed in his endeavours    
to escape. Imagination can picture nothing more beautiful   
than the colours of this fish: while covered by the waves be was   
entirely green ; and as the water gave him a case of transparent   
crystal, he really looked like one solid piece of living emerald;   
when he sprang into the air or swam fatigued upon the surface,   
his fins alone preserved their green, and the rest of his body   
appeared to be of the brightest yellow, his scales shining like   
   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0032" n="13"/>
   
gold wherever they caught the sun; while the blood which, as   
long as he remained in the sea, continued to spout in great quantities forces   
its way upwards   
through the water like a wreath of   
smoke, and then dispersed itself in separate globules   
among the spray. From the great loss of' blood his colours soon   
became paler; but when he was at length safely landed on deck,   
and beating himself to death against the flooring, agony renewed   
all the lustre of his tints: his fins were still green and his body   
golden, except his back, which was olive, shot with bright deep   
blue; his head and belly became silvery, and the spots with   
which the latter was mottled, changed with incessant rapidity,   
from deep olive to the most beautiful azure. Gradually his   
brilliant tints disappeared; they were succeeded by one uniform   
shade of slate colour, and when he was quite dead he exhibited   
nothing but dirty brown and dull dead white. As soon as all was   
over with him, the first thing done was to convert one of his fins   
into the resemblance of a flying-fish, for the purpose of decoying   
other dolphins ; and the second, to order some of the present gentleman    
to be got ready for dinner. He measured above four feet   
and a half.

At noon to-day we found ourselves in the latitude of Jamaica.   
We were promised the sight of Antigua on Sunday next, but   
that is now quite out of the question. We made but eight miles   
in the whole of yesterday ; and as Jamaica is still at the distance   
of eighteen hundred miles, at this rate of proceeding we may   
expect to reach it about eight months hence. The sky this   
evening presented us with quite a new phenomenon, a rose   
colored moon : she is to be at her full to-morrow; and this   
afternoon, about half-past four, she rose like a disk of silver,   
perfectly white and colourless ; but as she was exactly opposite   
sun at the time of his setting, the reflection of his rays   
a kind of pale blush over her orb, which produced an   
t as beautiful as singular. Indeed, the size and inconceivable    
brilliance of the sun, the clearness of the atmosphere, which   
assumed a faint greenish line, and was entirely without a   
cloud, the smoothness of the ocean, and the aforesaid rose-coloured moon   
altogether rendered   
this sunset the most magical   
in effect that I ever beheld ; and it was with great reluctance   
   
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0033" n="14"/>
  
that I was called away from admiring it to ascertain whether the   
merits of our new acquaintance, the dolphin, extended any further    
than his skin. Part of him, which was boiled for yesterday's    
dinner, was rather coarse and dry, and might have been   
mistaken for indifferent haddock. But his having been steeped   
in brine, and then broiled with a good deal of pepper and salt ,   
had improved him wonderfully, and to-day I thought him as good   
as any other fish.

<p>The wind has dwindled away to nothing. We are now so   
absolutely becalmed that I begin to suspect Neptune is amusing   
himself by making the ship take root in the ocean. I have got   
some locust plants on board in pots: if we get on as slowly as   
we have done for the last week, before we reach Jamaica my   
plants will be forest trees, little Jem, the cabin-boy, will have   
been obliged to shave, and the , black terrier will have died of   
old age. Great numbers of porpoises were playing about to   
day, and tumbling under the ship's very nose. When in their   
9xambols they allow themselves to be seen above the surface,   
they are of a dirty blackish brown, and as ugly as heart can   
wish ; but in the waves they acquire a fine sea-green cast, and   
their spouting up water in the sunbeams is extremely ornamental.

What little wind there is blows so perversely, that we have   
been obliged to alter our course; and instead of Antigua, we are   
now told that the Summer Islands (Shakespeare's "still vexed.   
Bermoothes") are the first land that we must expect to see.   
   
I am greatly disappointed at finding such a scarcity of monsters ;    
I had flattered myself that as soon as we should enter the   
Atlantic ocean, or at least the tropic, we should have seen whole   
shoals of sharks, whales, and dolphins, wandering about as plenty   
as sheep upon the South Downs; instead of which, a brace of   
dolphins, and a f6w flying-fish and porpoises, are the only inhabitants    
of the ocean who have as yet taken the trouble of paying   
us the common civility of a visit. However, I am promised that   
as soon as we approach the islands I shall have as many sharks   
as heart can wish.

between animals (in the human species they are so universal   
that I set no store by them), an instance of that kind which the   
captain related to me this morning gave me great pleasure.   
While lying in Black River harbour, Jamaica, two sharks were   
frequently seen playing about the ship; at length the female was   
killed, and the desolation  <hi rend="italic"> of  </hi> the male was excessive:-"Che, faro senz' Eurydice? "   
What be did  <hi rend="italic"> without  </hi> her remains a secret, but what be did   
 <hi rend="italic"> with </hi>    
her was clear enough; for scarce was the breath out of his Eurydice's body,   
when be stuck his   
teeth in her, and began to eat   
her up with all possible expedition. Even the sailors felt their   
sensibility excited by so peculiar a mark of posthumous attachment and to

this melancholy duty the

proceeded to chop his better half in pieces with their hatchets ;   
while the widower opened -his jaws as wide as possible, and   
gulped down pounds upon pounds of the dear departed as fast   
as they were thrown to him, with the greatest delight and all   
the avidity imaginable.  I make no doubt that all the while be

went into his stomach would make its way to his heart directly!   
" She was perfectly consistent," he said to himself; "she was   
excellent through life, and really she's extremely good now she's   
dead ! " I doubt whether the annals of Hymen can produce a   
similar instance of post-obitual affection. Certainly Calderon's   
" <hi rend="italic"> Amor despues de la Muerte"  </hi> has nothing that is worthy to be   
compared to it ; nor do I recollect in history any fact at all   
resembling it, except perhaps a circumstance which is recorded   
respecting Cambletes, king of Lydia, a monarch equally remark   
.able for his voracity and uxoriousness, and who, being one night   
completely overpowered by sleep, and at the same time violently   
tormented by hunger, eat up his queen without being conscious   
of it, and was mightily astonished the next morning, to wake   
with her hand in his mouth, the only bit that was le ft of her.   
But then Cambletes was quite unconscious what he was doing   
whereas the shark's mark of attachment was evidently intentional.

On this day, from a sense of propriety no doubt, as well as   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0035" n="16"/>
   
from having, nothing else to do, all the crew in the morning   
betook themselves to their studies. The carpenter was very   
seriously spelling a comedy; Edward was engaged with " The   
 Six Princesses 5 Babylon ;' a third was amusing himself with a   
 tract I On the Management of Bees;' another had borrowed the    
cabin-boy's "Sorrows of Werter,' and was reading it aloud to a,   
large circle-some whistling-and others yawning; and Werter's   
 abrupt transitions, and exclamations, and raptures, and refinements   
, read in the same loud monotonous tone, and without the   
 slightest respect paid to stops, had the oddest effect possible.   
 I was surprised to find that (except Edward's Fairy Tale)  <hi rend="italic"> none </hi>    
 of them were reading works that were at all likely to amuse   
them (Smollett or Fielding, for instance), or any which might    
interest them as relating to their profession, such as voyages and    
travels; much less any which had the slightest reference to the   
 particular day. However, as most of them were reading what   
 they could not possibly understand, they might mistake them for   
 books of devotion, for anything they knew to the contrary ; or,    
perhaps, they might have so much reverence for all books ill   
 print, as to think that, provided they did but read something, it    
was doing a good work, and it did not much matter what. So   
 one of Congreve's fine ladies swears Mrs. Mincing, the waiting-maid, to secrecy, " upon an odd volume of Messalina's Poems."   
 Sir Dudley North, too, informs us (or is it his brother Roger?    
but I mean the Turkey merchant)-that at Constantinople the    
respect for printed books is so great, that when people are sick,   
 they fancy that they can be  <hi rend="italic"> read  </hi> into health again; and if the    
Koran should not be in the way, they will make a shift with a    
few verses of the Bible, or a chapter or two of the Talmud, or   
 of any other book that comes first to hand, rather than not read    
something. I think Sir Dudley says, that he himself cured an   
old Turk of the toothache by administering a few pages of   
 ' Ovid's Metamorphoses;' and in an old receipt-book, we are    
directed for the cure of a double tertian fever, "to drink plentifully of   
cock-broth, and sleep with   
the Second Book of the, Iliad   
 under the pillow." If, instead of sleeping with it under the pillow, the   
 doctor had desired us to read the Second Book of tile    
Iliad in order that we might sleep, I should have had some faith   
 in his prescription myself.</p>

<p>During these last two days nothing very extraordinary, or of   
sufficient importance to deserve being handed down to the   
latest posterity, has occurred ; except that this morning a swinging rope   
knocked my hat into the   
sea, and away it sailed upon a   
voyage of discovery, like poor La Perouse, to return no more,   
I suppose; unless, indeed, like Polycrates, the fortunate tyrant   
of Samos, who threw his favourite ring into the ocean, and found   
it again in the stomach of the first fish that was served up at his   
table, -I should have the good luck (but I by no means reckon   
upon it) to catch a dolphin with my bat upon his bead: as to a   
porpoise, he never could squeeze his great numskull into it ; but   
our dolphin of last week was much about my own size, and I daresay such   
another would find   
my bat fit him to a miracle, and   
look very well in it.

<p>The weather is excessively close and sultry; and in point    
of heat there is no difference between the days and the nights; or if   
it is that the nights are rather the hottest of the two.   
The lightning is incessant, and it does not show itself forked   
or in flashes, but in wide sheets of mild mild blue light which spread    
themselves at once over the sky and sea; and, for the moment   
during which they last, make all the objects around as distinct   
as in daylight. The moon now does not rise till late, and during   
her absence the size and brilliancy the of the stars are admirable. In   
England they always seemed to me to peep through the blanket   
of the dark;" but here the heaven,; appear to be studded with   
them on the outside,  if they were chased with so many jewels:   
it is really Milton's "firmament of living sapphires;" and what   
with the lightning and the stars, and quantity of floating lights   
which just gleamed round the ship every moment, and then were   
gone again, to-night the sky had an effect so beautiful, that when   
at length the moon thought proper to show her great red drunken   
face, I thought that we did much better without her.   
The above-mentioned floating light' are a kind of sea-meteors,   
which, as I am told, are produced by the concussion of the   
 waves, while eddying in whirlpools round the rudder ; but still   

   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0037" n="18"/>

I saw them rise sometimes at so great a distance from the ship,   
 and there appeared to be something so like will in the direction   
 of their course-sometimes hurrying on, sometimes gliding   
 along quite slowly; now stopping and remaining motionless for   
a minute or two, and then hurrying on again,-that I could not   
be convinced of their not being Medusae, or some species or other    
of phosphoric animal: but whatever be the cause of this appearance, the   
effect is singularly   
beautiful. As to air, we have not enough to bless ourselves with. I had been   
led to believe, that    
when once we should have fallen in with the trade-winds, from   
 that moment we should sail into our destined port as rapidly and    
as directly as Truffaldino travels in Gozzi's farce ; when, having   
occasion to go from Asia to Europe, and being very much pressed   
 for time, he persuades a conjuror of his acquaintance to lend him   
 a devil, with a great pair of bellows, the nozzle of which being   
 directed right against his stern, away goes the traveller before   
 the stream of wind, with the devil after him, and the infernal'    
bellows never cease from working till they have blown him out    
of one quarter of the globe into another: but our trade-winds   
 must "hide their diminished heads" before Truffaldino's bellows.    
It seems that like the Moors, "in Africa the torrid," they are   
 of temper somewhat mulish;" for although, to be sure, when    
they  <hi rend="italic"> do </hi>  blow, they will only blow in one certain direction, yet   
 very often they will not blow at all; which has been the case for    
the last week: indeed, they seem to be but a queerish kind of a    
concern at best. About three years ago a fleet of merchantmen    
was becalmed near St. Vincent's: in a few days after their arrival,   
there happened a violent eruption of a volcano in that island, nor    
was it long before a favourable breeze sprang up. Unluckily,    
one of the ships had anchored rather nearer to the shore than the    
ethers, and was at the distance of about one hundred and fifty yards   
from the stream of the trade-wind ; nor could any possible efforts   
 of the crew, by tacking, by towing, or otherwise, ever enable   
 the vessel to conquer that one hundred and fifty yards : there    
she remained, as completely becalmed , as if there were not such   
 a thing as a breath of wind in the universe; and on the one    
band she had the mortification to see the rest of the merchantmen,   
 with their convoy (for it was in the very beat of the war), sail    
away with all their canvass spread and swelling; while, on the   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0038" n="19"/>
   
   
other hand, the sailors had the comfortable possibility of being    
suffocated every moment by the clouds of ashes which continued    
to fall on their deck every moment from the burning volcano,   
 although they were not nearer to St. Vincent's than eight or    
nine miles; indeed that distance went for nothing, as ashes fell    
upon vessels that were out at sea at least five hundred miles   
and Barbadoes being to windward of the volcano, such immense   
 quantities of its contents were carried to that island as almost    
covered the fields; and destroying vegetation completely wherever they   
fell, did inconceivable   
damage, while that which St.   
 Vincent's itself experienced was but trifling in proportion.   
</p>   
<p>Our captain is quite out of patience with the tortoise-Pace of   
our progress; for my part I care very little about it. Whether   
we have sailed slowly or rapidly, when a day is once over, I am   
just as much nearer advanced towards April, the time fixed for   
my return to England; and, what is of much more consequence,   
whether we have sailed slowly or rapidly, when a day is once   
over, I am just as much nearer advanced towards "that bourne,"   
to reach which, peaceably and harmlessly, is the only business   
of life, and towards which the whole of our existence forms but   
one continued journey.

We succeeded in catching another dolphin to-day; but he    
had not a hat on ; however, I just asked him whether he happened to have   
seen mine, but to little   
purpose ; for I found that   
 he could tell me nothing at all about it; so, instead of bothering   
 the poor animal with any more questions, we ate him.

The Captain told me that about three years ago lie had the   
 ill luck to be captured by a French frigate. As she had already   
 made prizes of two other merchantmen, it was determined to   
 sink his ship; which, after removing the crew and everything   
 in her that was valuable, was effected by firing her own guns    
down the hatchways. It was near three hours before she filled,   
 then down she went with a single plunge, head foremost, with   
 all her sails set and colours flying.

At length we have crawled into the Caribbean Sea, I was    
told that we were not to expect to see land to-day ; but on ship-board our not seeing a thing  <hi rend="italic"> to-day  </hi> by no means implies that we   
shall not see it before to-morrow; for the nautical day is supposed to   
conclude at noon, when the   
solar observation is taken;   
and, therefore, the making land to-day, or not, very often depends   
upon our making it before twelve o'clock, or after it. This was   
the case in the present instance ; for noon was scarcely passed when    
we saw Descada (a small island totally unprovided with water, and    
whose only produce consists in a little cotton), Guadaloupe, and    
Marie Galante, though the latter was at so great a distance as to   
be scarcely visible. At sunset Antigua was in sight.

The sun rose upon Montserrat and Nevis, with the  <hi rend="italic"> Rodondo </hi>    
rock between them, "apricis natio gratissima mergis,"-for it is    
perpetually covered with innumerable flocks of gulls, boobies,   
pelicans, and other sea-birds. Then came St. Christopher's and    
St. Eustatia; and in the course of the afternoon we passed over    
the Aves bank, a collection of sand, rock, and mud, extending   
about two hundred miles, and terminated at each end by a   
small island: one of them inhabited by a few fishermen, the    
other only by sea-birds. Of all the Atlantic isles the soil of St.   
Christopher's is by some supposed to be the richest, the land frequently   
producing three   
hogsheads an acre. I rather think that    
this was the first island discovered by Columbus, and that it took   
its name from his patron-saint. Montserrat is so rocky, and the   
roads so steep and difficult, that the sugar is obliged to be    
brought down in bags upon the backs of mules, and not put into    
tasks till its arrival on the sea-shore.   
</p>   
<p>The weather is now quite delicious; there is just wind enough   
to send us forward and keep the air cool : the sun is brilliant,   
without being overpowering: the swell of the waves is scarcely   
perceptible, and the ship moves along so steadily that the deck    
affords almost as firm footing as if we were walking on land.   
During the night we passed Santa Cruz,, an island which, from   
the perfection to which its cultivation has been carried, is called    
the Garden of the West Indies."

Having left Porto Rico behind us, at noon to-day we passed   
the insulated rock of Alcavella, lying about six miles from St.   
Domingo, which is now in sight, As this part of the Caribbean    
Sea is much infested by pirates from the Caraccas, all our muskets have   
been put in repair, and   
to-day the guns were loaded, of    
which we mount eight; but as one of them, during the last    
voyage, went overboard in a gale of wind, its place has been   
supplied by a  <hi rend="italic"> Quaker, i. e. </hi>  a sham gun of wood-so called, I    
suppose, because it would not fight if it were called upon. These   
pirate vessels are small schooners, armed with a single twenty-four pounder, which moves upon a swivel; and their crews are   
composed of negroes and outlaws of all nations, their numbers   
varying from one hundred to one hundred and fifty men. To-day we have been visited by several men-of-war birds and tropic   
birds; one is a species of gull, perfectly white, and distinguished   
by a single very long feather in its tail; its nautical name is   
the boatswain."   
As we sail along, the air is absolutely loaded with "Sabean    
odours from the spicy shores" of St. Domingo, which we were    
still coasting at sunset.

At day-break Jamaica was in sight, or rather it would have   
been in sight, only that we could not see it. The weather was   
gloomy, with much wind and rain. I remember my good friend,   
Walter Scott, asserts, that at the death of a poet the groans and    
tears of his heroes and heroines swell the blast and increase the    
river: perhaps something of the same kind takes. place at the    
arrival of a West India proprietor from Europe; and all this   
rain and wind proceed from the eyes and lungs of my agents and    
overseers, who, for the last twenty years, have been reigning in   
my dominions with despotic authority; but now   
   
<q><lg><l>"Whose groans in roaring winds complain,</l>  
<l>Whose tears of rage impel the rain;"</l></lg></q>  
   
because, on the approach of the sovereign himself, they must   
evacuate the place and resign the deputed sceptre. "Hinc illae   
   
    
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0041" n="22"/>
   
lachrymae!" this is the cause of-,our being soaked to the skin   
this morning. However, about noon the weather cleared up, and   
allowed us to verify, with our own eyes, that we had reached   
the " Land of Springs," without having been invited by any   
Piccaroon vessel to "walk the plank" instead of the deck;   
which is a compliment very generally paid by those gentry, after   
they have taken the trouble of laying a plank over the side of a   
captured ship, in order that the passengers and the crew may   
walk overboard without any inconvenience.   
</p>   
<p>We arrived at the east end of the island, passed Pedro Point   
and Starvegut Bay, and arrived before Black River Bay (our   
destined harbour) soon after two o'clock ; but here we were   
obliged to come to a standstill: the channel is very dangerous,   
extremely narrow, and full of sunken rocks; so that it can only   
be entered by a vessel drawing so much water as ours with   
particular wind, and when there is not any apprehension of a   
sudden squall. We were, therefore, obliged to drop anchor, and    
are now riding within a couple of miles of the shore, but with   
as utter an incapability of reaching it as if we were still at   
Gravesend. The north side of the island is said to be extremely   
beautiful and romantic; but the south, which we coasted to-day,   
is low, barren, and without any recommendation whatever. As   
yet I can only look at Jamaica as one does on a man who comes   
to pay money, and whom we are extremely well pleased to see,   
however little the fellow's appearance may be in his favour.

We passed the whole of the day in vain endeavours to work   
ourselves into the bay. At one time, indeed, we got very near the   
shore, but the consequence was, that we were within an ace of   
striking upon a rock, and very much obliged to a sudden gust of   
wind, which, blowing right off shore, blew us out of the channel,   
and left us at night in a much more perilous situation than we   
had occupied the evening before, though even that had been by   
Do means secure. At three o'clock, the other passengers went   
on shore in the jolly-boat, and proceeded to their destination ;   
but as I was still more than thirty miles distant from my estate,   
I preferred waiting on board till the Captain should have   
moored his vessel in safety, and be at liberty to take me in his   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0042" n="23"/>
  
pinnace to Savannah la Mar, when I should find myself within   
a few miles of my own house.   
</p>  
<p>In the course of the afternoon, one of the sailors took up a   
fish of a very singular shape and most brilliant colours, as it   
-floated along upon the water. It seemed to be gasping, and lay   
with its belly upwards ; it was supposed to have eaten something   
poisonous, as whenever it was touched it appeared to be full of   
life, and squirted the water in our faces with great spirit and    
dexterity. But no sooner was he suffered to remain quiet in the   
tub , than be turned upon his back and again was gasping. He   
had a large round transparent globule, intersected with red    
veins, under the belly, which some imagined to proceed from a   
rupture, and to be the occasion of his disease. But I could not   
discover any vestige of a wound ; and the globule was quite    
solid to the touch ; neither did the fish appear to be sensible    
when it was pressed upon. No one on board had ever seen this   
kind of fish till then ; its name is the "Doctor Fish."   
</p>   
<p>A black pilot came on board yesterday, in a canoe hollowed   
out of the cotton-tree ; and when it returned for him this morning it   
brought us a water-melon. I   
never met with a worse    
article in my life; the pulp is of a faint greenish yellow, stained   
here and there with spots of moist red, so that it looks exactly    
as if the servant in slicing it had cut his finger, and suffered it    
to bleed over the fruit. Then the seeds being of a dark purple,   
present the happiest imitation of drops of clotted gore; and    
altogether (prejudiced as I was by its appearance), when I had   
put a single bit into my mouth, it ho such a kind of Shylocky    
taste of raw flesh about it (not that I recollect having ever eaten    
a bit of raw flesh itself), that I sent away my plate, and was   
perfectly satisfied as to the merits of the fruit.

At length the ship has squeezed herself into this champagne   
bottle of a bay! Perhaps, the satisfaction attendant upon our    
having overcome the difficulty, added something to the illusion    
of its effect; but the beauty of the atmosphere, the dark purple   
mountains, the shores covered with mangroves of the liveliest   
green down to the very edge of the water, and the light-coloured    
houses with their lattices and piazzas completely embowered in   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0043" n="24"/>
   
trees, altogether made the scenery of the Bay wear a very picturesque   
appearance. And, to   
complete the charm, the sudden   
sounds of the drum and banjee called our attention to a procession of the    
 <hi rend="italic"> John-Canoe,  </hi> which was proceeding to celebrate the   
opening of the new year at the town of Black River. The John-Canoe is a   
Merry-Andrew dressed   
in a striped doublet, and   
bearing upon his head a kind of pasteboard house-boat filled with   
puppets, representing, some sailor-, others soldiers, others again   
slaves at work on a plantation, &amp;-c. The negroes are allowed   
three days for holidays at Christmas, and also New-year's day,   
which being the last is always reckoned by them as the festival   
of the greatest importance. It is for this day that they reserve   
their finest dresses, and Jay their schemes for displaying their   
show and expense to the greatest advantage; and it is then that   
the John-Canoe is considered not merely as a person of material   
consequence, but one whose presence is absolutely indispensable.   
-Nothing could look more gay than the procession which we now   
saw with its train of attendants, all dressed in white, and marching two by   
two (except when the   
file was broken here and there   
by a single horseman), and its band of negro music, and its.   
scarlet flags fluttering about in the breeze, now disappearing be   
hind a projecting clump of mangrove-trees, and then again   
emerging into an open part of the road, as it wound along the   
shore towards the town of Black River. I had determined not   
to go on shore, till I should land for good and all at Savannah   
la Mar. But although I could resist the " magnus telluris   
amor," there was no resisting John-Canoe; so, in defiance of a   
broiling afternoon's sun, about four o'clock we left the vessel for   
the town.

It was, as I understand, formerly one of some magnitude; but   
it now consists only of a few houses, owing to a spark from a   
tobacco-pipe or a candle having lodged upon a mosquito-net   
during dry weather; and although the conflagration took place   
at mid-day, the whole town was reduced to ashes The few   
streets (I believe there were not above two, but those were    
wide and regular, and the houses looked very neat) were now   
crowded with people, and it seemed to be allowed, upon all   
hands, that New-year's day had never been celebrated there with   
more expense and festivity.

districts; and-ever since, the whole island, at Christmas, is sepa-rated into the rival factions of the Blues and the Reds (the Red

for setting, forth their processions with the greatest taste and    
magnificence. This year, several gentlemen in the neigbbourhood of Black   
River had subscribed   
very largely towards the   
expenses of the show; and certainly it produced the gayest and   
most amusing scene that I ever witnessed, to which the mutual    
jealousy and pique of the two parties against each other contributed in no   
slight degree. The   
champions of the rival Roses,   
of the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, none of them could exceed    
the scornful animosity and spirit of depreciation with which the   
Blues and the Reds of Black River examined the efforts at display   
of each other. The Blues had the advantage beyond a doubt ;   
this a Red girl told us that she could Dot deny ; but still,    
" though the Reds were beaten, she would not be a Blue girl for   
the whole universe!" On the other hand , Miss Edwards.(the   
mistress of the hotel from whose window we saw the show) was   
rank Blue to the very tips of her fingers, and bad, indeed, contributed one   
of her female slaves to   
sustain a very important   
character in the show; for when the Blue procession was ready   
to set forward, there was evidently a hitch, something was wanting; and   
there seemed to be no   
possibility of getting on without    
it-when suddenly we saw a tall woman dressed in mourning   
(being Miss Edwards herself) rush out of our hotel, dragging   
along by the hand a strange uncouth kind of a glittering tawdry   
figure, all feathers, and pitchfork, and painted pasteboard, who    
moved most reluctantly, and turned out to be no less a personage   
than Britannia herself, with a pasteboard shield covered with the    
arms of Great-Britain, a trident in her hand, and a helmet made   
of pale-blue silk and silver. The poor girl, it seems, was bashful    
at appearing in this conspicuous manner before so many spectators, and   
hung back when it came   
to the point. But her mistress  
  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0045" n="26"/>
   
had seized hold of her, and placed her by main force in her   
destined position. The music struck up; Miss Edwards gave   
the Goddess a great push forwards; the drumsticks and the   
elbows of the fiddlers attacked her in the rear; and on went    
Britannia willy-nilly!   
</p>  
<p>  
The Blue girls call themselves the Blue girls of Waterloo."   
Their motto was the more patriotic that of the Red was the more   
gallant:-" Britannia rules the day! " streamed upon the Blue   
flag, ; " Red girls forever! " floated upon the Red. But, in point   
of taste and invention, the former carried it hollow. First marched   
Britannia; then came a band of music; then the flag; then the   
Blue King and Queen-the Queen splendidly dressed in white   
and silver (in scorn of the opposite party, her train was borne   
by a little girl in red) ; his Majesty wore a full British Admiral's   
uniform, with a-white satin sash, and a huge cocked hat with a   
gilt paper crown upon the top of it. These were immediately   
followed by " Nelson's car," being a kind of canoe decorated   
with blue and silver drapery, and with " Trafalgar " written on   
the front of it; and the procession was closed by a Ion., train of   
Blue grandees (the women dressed in uniforms of white, with   
robes of blue muslin), all Princes and Princesses, Dukes and   
Duchesses, every mother's child of them.   
</p>   
<p>The Red girls were also dressed very gaily and prettily, but   
they had nothing in point of invention that could vie with Nelson's Car and   
Britannia; and when   
the Red throne made its   
appearance, language cannot express the contempt with which   
our landlady eyed it. " It was neither one thing nor t'other,   
" Miss Edwards was of opinion. "Nothing but a few yards, of   
calico stretched over planks-and look, look, only look at it   
behind ! you may see the bare boards! By way of a throne,   
indeed! Well,  to be sure, Miss Edwards never saw a poorer   
thing in her life, that she must say! " And then she told me,   
that somebody had just snatched at a medal which Britannia   
wore round her neck, and had endeavoured to force it away. I    
asked her who had done so? " Oh, one of the Red party, of   
 <hi rend="italic"> course </hi>  ! " The Red party was evidently Miss Edwards's Mrs.   
Grundy. John-Canoe made no part of the procession; but he   
and his rival, John-Crayfish (a personage of whom I heard, but    
could not obtain a sight), seemed to apt upon quite an    
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0046" n="27"/>
  
   
independent interest; and go about from house to house, tumbling   
and playing antics to pick up money for themselves. -</p>                                       
<p>A play was now proposed to us, and, o , f course, accepted.   
Three men and a girl accordingly made their appearance; the   
men dressed like the tumblers at Astley's, the lady very tastefully   
in white and silver, and all with their faces concealed by masks   
of thin blue silk; and they proceeded to perform the quarrel   
between Douglas and Glenalvon, and the fourth act of I The   
Fair Penitent.' They were all quite perfect, and bad no need of   
a prompter. As to Lothario, he was by far the most comical   
dog that I ever saw in my life, and his dying scene exceeded all   
description; Mr. Coates himself might have taken hints from   
him! As -soon as Lothario was fairly dead, and Calista bad   
made her exit in distraction, they all began dancing reels like so   
Many mad people, till they Were obliged to make way for the   
Waterloo procession, who came to collect money for the next   
year's festival ; one of them singing, another dancing to the tune,   
while she presented her money-box to the spectators, and the   
rest of the Blue girls filling up the chorus. I cannot say much   
in praise of the black Catalani ; but nothing could be more light,   
and playful, and graceful, than the extempore movements of the   
dancing-girl. Indeed, through the whole day I had been struck   
with the precision of their march, the ease and grace of their   
action, the elasticity of their step, and the lofty air with which   
they carried their heads-all, indeed, except poor Britannia, who   
hung down hers in the Most "goddess-dike manner imaginable   
The first song was the old Scotch air of -Logie of Buchan,' o   
which the 'girl sang one single stanza forty times over. Bu   
the second was in praise of the Hero of Heroes; so I gave the   
songstress a dollar to teach it to me, and drink the Duke's health   
It was not easy to make out what she said, but as well as I could   
 understand them, the words ran as follows:-  
<q><lg><l>"Come, rise up, our gentry,</l>  
<l>And hear about Waterloo;</l>   
<l>Ladies, take your spy-glass,</l>  
<l>And attend to what we do;</l></lg></q>  
  
<q><lg><l>For one and one makes two,</l>  
  
<l>But one alone must be, </l>  
<l>Then singee, singee Waterloo,</l>  
<l>None so brave as he ! "</l></lg></q>  
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0047" n="28"/>
   
-and then there came something about green and white flowers,   
and a Duchess, and a lily-white Pig, and going on board of a   
(lashing man-of-war; but what they all had to do with the Duke,   
or with each other, I could not make even a guess. I was going   
to ask for an explanation, but suddenly half of them gave a   
shout loud enough "to fright the realms of Chaos and old   
Night," and away they flew, singers, dancers, and all. The   
cause of this was the sudden illumination of the town with quantities of   
large chandeliers and   
bushes, the branches of which   
were stuck all over with great blazing torches: the effect was   
really beautiful, and the excessive rapture of the black multitude   
at the spectacle was as well worth the witnessing as the sight   
itself.</p>  
  
<p>I never saw so many people who appeared to be so unaffectedly   
.happy. In England, at fairs and races, half the visitors at least   
seem to have been only brought there for the sake of traffic, and   
to be too busy to be amused ; but here nothing was thought of    
but real pleasure ; and that pleasure seemed to consist in singing,   
dancing, and laughing, in seeing and being Seen, in showing their   
own fine clothes, or in admiring those of others. There   
were no people selling or buying; no servants and landladies   
bustling and passing about; and at eight o'clock, as we passed   
through the market-place, where was the greatest illumination,   
and which, of course, was most thronged, I did not see a single   
person drunk, nor had I observed a single quarrel through the   
course of the day;, except, indeed, when some thoughtless fellow   
crossed the line of the procession, and received by the way a   
good box of the ear from the Queen or one of her attendant   
Duchesses. Everybody made the same remark to me; " Well,   
 <hi rend="italic"> si </hi> r, what do you think Mr. Wilberforce would think of the state   
of the negroes, if he could see this scene? " and certainly, to   
judge by this one specimen, of all beings that I have yet seen,   
these were the happiest. As we were passing to our boat,   
through the market-place, -suddenly we saw Miss Edwards dart   
out of the crowd, and seize the Captain's arm-" Captain! Captain ! " cried   
she, " for the love of   
Heaven, only look at the   
 <hi rend="italic"> Red  </hi> lights ! Old iron hoops, nothing but old iron hoops, I declare !   
Well! for my part 1 " and   
then, with a contemptuous   
toss of her head, away frisked Miss Edwards triumphantly.

The St. Elizabeth, which sailed from England at the same   
time with our vessel, was attacked by a pirate from Carthagena,   
near the rocks of Alcavella, who attempted three times to board   
her, though he was at length beaten off; so that our Piccaroon   
preparations were by no means taken without good reason.   
</p><p>  
At four o'clock this morning I embarked in the cutter for   
Savannah la Mar, lighted by the most beautiful of morning stars:   
certainly, if this star be really Lucifer, that " Son of the Morning," the   
Devil must be "an   
extremely pretty fellow." But, in   
spite of the fineness of the morning, our passage was a most   
disagreeable concern: there was a violent swell in the sea; and   
a strong north wind, though it carried us forward with great   
rapidity, overwhelmed us with whole sheets of foam so incessantly that I   
expected, as soon as the   
sun should have evaporated the moisture, to see the boat's crew covered   
with salt, and   
looking like so many Lot's wives after her metamorphosis.   
</p><p>  
The distance was about thirty miles, and soon after nine o'clock   
we reached Savannah la Mar, where I found my trustee and a   
whole cavalcade waiting to conduct me to my estate. He had   
brought -with him a curricle and pair for myself, a gig for my   
servant, two black boys upon mules, and a cart with eight oxen   
to convey my baggage. The road was excellent, and we bad no   
above five miles to travel; and as soon as the carriage entered,   
my gates, the uproar and confusion which ensued sets all description at   
defiance. 'The works   
were instantly all abandoned   
everything that bad life came flocking to the house from a   
quarters: and not only the men, and the women, and the children, but, " by   
a bland assimilation,"   
the hogs, and the dogs, and   
the geese, and the fowls, and the turkeys, all came hurrying   
along by instinct, to see what could possibly be the matter, and   
seemed to be afraid of arriving too late. Whether the pleasure   
of the negroes was sincere may be doubted; but certainly it was   
the loudest that I ever witnessed : they all talked together, sat   
danced, shouted, and, in the violence of their gesticulations   
tumbled over each other, and rolled about upon the ground.   
Twenty voices at once inquired after uncles, and aunts,  and   
grandfathers, and great-grandmothers of mine, who had been   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0049" n="30"/>
   
buried long before I was in existence, and whom, I verily believe, most of   
them only knew by   
tradition. One woman held   
up her little naked black child to me, grinning from car to ear"   
Look, massa, look here! -him nice lilly neger for massa!    
Another complained,-" So long since none come see we, massa   
good massa come at last." As for the old people, they were   
all in one and the same story,-now they had lived once   
to see massa, they were ready for dying to-morrow, " them no   
care."   
</p><p>  
The shouts, the gaiety, the wild laughter, the strange and    
sudden bursts of singing and dancing, and several old women,   
wrapped up in large cloaks, their heads bound round with   
different-coloured handkerchiefs,   
leaning on a staff, and standing   
motionless in the middle of the hubbub, with their eyes fixed   
upon the portico which I occupied, formed an exact counterpart   
of the festivity of the witches in Macbeth. Nothing could be   
more odd or more novel than the whole scene; and yet there   
was something in it by which I could not help being affected   
perhaps it was the consciousness that all these human beings were   
my slaves; to be sure, I never saw people look more happy in   
my life, and I believe their condition to be much more comfortable than   
that of the labourers of   
Great Britain; and after all,   
slavery, in  <hi rend="italic"> their  </hi> case, is but another name for servitude, now that   
no more negroes can be forcibly carried away from Africa, and   
subjected to the horrors of the voyage, and the seasoning after   
their arrival: but still I had already experienced that Juliet was   
wrong in saying, "What's in a name?" for soon after my   
reaching the lodging-house at Savannah la Mar, a remarkably   
clean-looking negro lad presented himself with some water and   
a towel: I concluded him to belong to the inn; and, on my   
returning the towel, as he found that I took no notice of him, he   
at length ventured to introduce himself by saying, " Massa not   
know me; me  <hi rend="italic"> your slave!  </hi> "-and really the sound made me feel   
a pang at the heart. The lad appeared all gaiety and good humour, and his   
whole countenance   
expressed anxiety to recommend himself to my notice; but the word "slave   
" seemed to   
imply that, although he did feel pleasure then in serving me, if   
he had detested me he must have served me still. I really felt   
quite humiliated at the moment, and was tempted to tell him,   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0050" n="31"/>
   
" Do not say that again ; say that you are my negro, but do not    
call yourself my slave."   
</p><p>  
Altogether, they shouted and sang me into a violent headache.   
It is now one in the morning, and I bear them still shouting and   
Singing. I gave them a holiday for Saturday next, and told    
them that I had brought them all presents from England; and   
so, I believe, we parted very good friends.

I have reached Jamaica in the best season for seeing my property in a   
favourable point of view ;   
it is crop time, when all   
the laborious work is over, and the negroes are the most healthy    
and merry. This morning I went to visit the hospital, and   
found there only eight patients out of three hundred negroes,   
and not one of them a serious case. Yesterday I had observed   
a remarkably handsome Creole girl, called Psyche, and she   
really deserved the name. This morning a little brown girl    
made her appearance at breakfast, with an orange bough, to flap   
away the flies, and, on inquiry, she proved to be an emanation   
of the aforesaid Psyche. It is evident, therefore, that Psyche   
has already visited the palace of Cupid; I heartily hope that she   
is not now upon her road to the infernal regions.   
</p>   
<p>I passed the morning in driving about the estate: my house   
is frightful to look at, but very clean and comfortable in the in   
side; some of the scenery is very picturesque, from the lively   
green of the trees and shrubs, and the. hermitage-like appearance of the   
negro buildings, all   
situated in little gardens and   
embosomed in sweet-smelling shrubberies. Indeed, everything   
appears much better than I expected; the negroes seem healthy   
and contented, and so perfectly at their ease that our English   
squires would be mightily astonished at being accosted so familiarly by   
their farmers. This   
delightful north wind keeps the   
air temperate and agreeable. I live upon shaddocks and pine   
apples. The dreaded mosquitoes are not worse than gnats, nor   
as bad as the Sussex harvest-bugs; and, as yet, I never felt my   
self in more perfect health. There was a man once who fell   
from the top of a steeple, and perceiving no inconvenience in   
his passage through the air, " Come," said be to himself, while in   
the act of falling, " really this is well enough yet, if it would but

last." Cubina, my young Savannah la Mar acquaintance is appointed my   
black attendant; and as I   
had desired him to bring   
me any native flowers of Jamaica, this evening he brought me a   
very pretty one; the negroes, he said, called it " John-to-Heal,"   
but in white language it was  <hi rend="italic"> hoccoco-pickang;  </hi> it proved to be   
the wild ipecacuanha.

There were three things against which I was particularly cautioned, and   
which three things I was   
determined  <hi rend="italic"> not  </hi> to do,-to take exercise after ten in the day ; to be exposed to the dews   
after sun-down; and to sleep at a Jamaica lodging-house. So,   
yesterday, I set off for Montego Bay at eight o'clock in the   
morning, and travelled till three; walked home from a ball after   
midnight; and that home was a lodging-house at Montego Bay;   
but the lodging-house was such a cool, clean lodging-house, and    
the landlady was such an obliging, smiling landlady, with the   
whitest of all possible teeth, and the blackest of all possible eyes,   
that no harm. could happen to me from occupying, an apartment   
-which been prepared by  <hi rend="italic"> her.  </hi> She was called out of her bed   
to make my room read for me; Yet she did everything with so   
much good will and cordiality-no quick answers, no mutterings : inns   
would be bowers of   
Paradise if they were all rented   
by mulatto landladies like Judy James.   
</p><p>I was much pleased with the scenery of Montego Bay, and   
with the neatness and cleanliness of the town; indeed, what with   
the sea washing it, and the picturesque aspect of the piazzas and   
verandas, it is impossible for a West Indian town so situated,   
and in such a climate, not to present an agreeable appearance.   
But the first. part of the road exceeds in beauty all that I have    
ever seen; it wound through mountain-lands of my own, their    
summits of the boldest, and at the same time of the most   
beautiful shapes; their sides ornamented with bright green   
woods of bamboo, logwood, prickly-yellow, broad-leaf, and   
trumpet trees; and so completely covered with the most lively   
verdure, that once, when we found a piece of barren rock,  Cubina pointed   
it out to me as a   
curiosity,-" Look, Massa, rock",   
quite naked!" The cotton-tree presented itself on all-sides;   
but as this is the season for its shedding its leaves, its wide-   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0052" n="33"/>
   
spreading bare white arms contributed nothing to the beauty of   
the scene, except where the wild-fig and various creeping plants   
had completely mantled the stems and branches; and then its   
gigantic height, and the fantastic wreathings of its limbs, from   
which numberless green withes and strings of wild flowers were   
streaming, rendered it exactly the very tree for which a landscape-painter   
would have wished.   
The air, too, was delicious;   
the flagrance of the sweet-wood, and of several other scented   
trees, but, above all, of the delicious logwood (of which most of   
the fences in Westmoreland are made), composed an atmosphere    
such, that if Satan, after promising them "a buxom air, embalmed with   
odours," had transported   
Sin and' Death thither,   
the charming couple must have acknowledged their papa's promises   
fulfilled.   
</p><p>  
We travelled the first ten miles (Montego Bay being about   
thirty from my estate of Cornwall) without seeing a human   
creature; nor, indeed, anything that had life in it, except a black   
snake basking in the sunshine, and a few John-Crows -a species   
of vulture, whose utility is so great that its destruction is prohibited by   
law, under a heavy   
penalty. In a country where putrefaction is so rapid, it is of infinite   
consequence to preserve an   
animal which, if a bullock or horse falls dead in the held, immediately   
flies to the carcass before   
it has time to corrupt, and   
gobbles it up before you can say " John Crow," much less " Jack   
Robinson.". The bite of the black snake is slightly venomous,   
but that is all-, as to the great yellow one, it -is perfectly innoxious, and so   
timid that it always   
runs away from you. The only   
dangerous species of serpent is the whip-snake, so called from   
its exactly resembling the lash of a whip, in length, thinness,   
pliability, and whiteness; but even the bite of this is not mortal)   
except from very great neglect, The most beautiful tree, c   
rather group of trees, all to nothing, is the bamboo, both from   
its Verdure and from its elegance of form : as to the -cotton-tree   
it answers no purpose, either of ornament or utility; or, rather   
it is not suffered to answer any, since it is forbidden by law to   
export its down, lest it should hurt the fur trade in the manufacture of hats:   
its only present use is   
to furnish the negroes, with    
canoes, which are hollowed out of its immense trunks. I am   
yet so much enchanted with the country, that it would require   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0053" n="34"/>
   
no very strong additional inducements to make me establish   
myself here altogether ; and, in that   
case, my first care would be to   
build for myself a cottage among these mountains, in which I   
might pass the sultry months,-

As I was returning this morning from Montego Bay, about a   
mile from my own estate, a figure presented itself before me, I   
really think the most picturesque that I ever beheld -it was a   
mulatto girl, born upon Cornwall, but whom the overseer of a   
neighbouring estate bad obtained my permission to exchange for   
another slave, as well as two little children, whom she had   
borne to him ; but, as yet, lie has been unable to procure a substitute,   
owing to the difficulty of   
purchasing single negroes, and   
Mary Wiggins is still my slave. However, as she is considered   
as being manumitted, she had not dared to present herself at   
Cornwall on my arrival, lest she should have been considered as   
an intruder; but she now threw herself in my way to tell me   
how glad she was to see me, for that she ; had always thought till   
now (which is the general complaint) that "  <hi rend="italic"> she had no massa ;" </hi>    
and also to obtain a regular invitation to my negro festival tomorrow. By   
this universal   
complaint, it appears that, while   
Mr. Wilberforce is lamenting their hard fate in being subject to   
a master,  <hi rend="italic"> their  </hi> greatest fear is the not having a master whom   
they know ; and that to be told by the negroes of another estate   
that 41 they belong to no massa," is one of the most contemptuous   
reproaches that can be cast   
upon them. Poor creatures,   
when they happened to hear on Wednesday evening that my   
carriage was ordered for Montego Bay the next morning they   
fancied that I was going away for good and all, and came up to   
the house in such a hubbub, that my agent was obliged to speak    
to them, and pacify them with the assurance that I should come   
back on Friday without fail.   
</p><p>  
But to return to Mary Wiggins: she was much too pretty   
not to obtain her invitation to Cornwall; on the contrary, I   
 <hi rend="italic"> insisted  </hi> upon her coming, and bade her tell her  <hi rend="italic"> husband   
 </hi> that I   
admired his taste very much for having chosen her. I really   
think that her form and features were the most <hi rend="italic">statue-like</hi> that I  
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0054" n="35"/>
   
ever met with: her complexion had no yellow in it, and yet was    
bot brown enough to be dark-it was more of an ash-dove colour than   
anything, else; her teeth   
were admirable, both for colour and shape; her eyes equally mild and   
bright; and her face merely   
broad enough to give it all possible softness and grandness of contour : her   
air and countenance   
would have suitedYarico; but she reminded me most of Grassini in " La   
Verginedel Sole," only   
that Mary Wiggins was a thousand times more beautiful, and that, instead   
of' a white robe, she   
wore a mixed dress of brown, white, and dead yellow, which harmonized   
ex-cellently with her   
complexion; while one of her beautiful   
arms was thrown across her brow to shade her eyes, and a profusion of   
rings on her fingers   
glittered in the sunbeams. Mary   
Wiggins and an old cotton-tree are the most picturesque objects   
that I have seen for these twenty years.

On my arrival at home, my agent made me a very elegant   
little present of a scorpion and a couple of centipedes : the first   
was given to him, but the large centipede he had shaken out of   
a book last night, and having immediately covered her up in a   
phial of rum, he found this morning that she had produced a   
young one, which was lying drowned by her side.   
</p>   
<p>I find that my negroe were called away from their attention   
to the works yesterday evening (for the crop is now making with   
the greatest activity), and kept us up all night by a fire at a neighbouring   
estate. On these   
occasions a fire-shell is blown, and all   
the negroes of the adjoining plantations hasten to give their   
assistance.  On this occasion the fire was extinguished with the   
loss of only five negroe houses ;  -but this is a heavy concern to the   
poor negro proprietors, who have lost in it their whole stock of    
clothes, and furniture, and finery, which they had been accumulating for   
years, and to which their   
attachment is excessive.

This was the day given to my negroes as a festival on my   
arrival. A couple of heifers were slaughtered for them : they   
were allowed as much  rum and sugar, and noise, and dancing   
as they chose; and as to the two latter, certainly they profited    
by the permission. About two o'clock they began to assemble   
round the house, all dressed in their holiday clothes, which, both   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0055" n="36"/>
   
for men and women, were chiefly white; only that the women',   
were decked out with a profusion of be-ads and corals, and gold   
ornaments of all descriptions; and that while the blacks wore   
jackets, the mulattoes generally wore cloth coats; and inasmuch   
as they were all plainly clean instead of being shabbily fashion   
able, and affected to be nothing except that which they really   
were, they looked twenty times more like gentlemen than nine   
tenths of the bankers' clerks who swagger up and down Bond   
Street. It is a custom as to the mulatto children, that the males   
born on an estate should never be employed as field negroes, but   
as tradesmen ; the females are brought up as domestics about the   
house. I had particularly invited "  <hi rend="italic"> Mr.  </hi> John-Canoe " (which   
I found to be the polite manner in which the negroes spoke of   
him), and there arrived a couple of very gay and gaudy ones.   
I inquired whether one of them was " John-Crayfish ;" but I was   
told that John-Crayfish was John-Canoe's rival and enemy, and   
might belong to the factions of " the Blues and the Reds;" but   
on Cornwall they were all friends, and therefore there were only   
the father and the son-Mr. John-Canoe, senior, and Mr. John-Canoe,   
junior.   
</p><p>  
The person who gave me this information was a young    
mulatto carpenter, called Nicholas, whom I had noticed in the   
crowd, on my first arrival, for his clean appearance and intelligent   
countenance; and he now   
begged me to notice the smaller   
of the two John-Canoe machines. "  To be sure," be said, " it   
was not so large nor so showy as the other, but then it was much   
better  <hi rend="italic"> proportioned  </hi> (his own word), and altogether much    
prettier;" and lie said so much in praise of it, that I asked him   
whether lie knew the maker? and then out came the motive:    
" 0h, yes ! it was made by John Fuller, who lived in the next    
house to him, and worked in the same shop, and indeed they   
were just like brothers." So I desired to see his  <hi rend="italic"> fidus Achates, </hi>    
and he brought me as smart and intelligent a little fellow as eye   
ever beheld, who came grinning from ear to par to tell me that   
lie had made every bit of the canoe with his own hands, and had   
set to work upon it the moment that he knew of massa's coming   
to Jamaica. And indeed it was as fine as paint, pasteboard, gilt   
paper, and looking-glass could make it ! Unluckily, the breeze   
being very strong blew off a fine glittering umbrella, surmounted   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0056" n="37"/>
  
with a plume of John-Crow feathers, which crowned the top;   
and a little wag of a negro boy whipped it up, clapped it upon his   
head, and performed the part of an impromptu Mr. John-Canoe   
with so much fun and grotesqueness, that he fairly beat the    
original performers out of the pit, and carried off all the applause   
of the spectators; and a couple of my dollars. The John-Canoes    
are fitted out at the expense of the rich negroes, who afterwards   
00 69 money collected from the spectators during their performance,   
allotting one share to the   
representator himself and   
it is usual for the master of the estate to give them a couple of   
guineas apiece.   
</p>   
<p>This Nicholas, whom I mentioned, is a very interesting   
person, both from his good looks and gentle manners, and from   
his story.  He is the son of a white man, who on his death-bed   
charged his nephew and heir to purchase the freedom of this   
natural child. The nephew had promised to do so; I had consented; nothing   
was necessary but to   
find the substitute (which   
is no easy matter) ; when about six months ago the nephew   
broke his neck, and the property went to a distant relation.   
application on behalf of poor Nicholas has been made to the   
heir, and I heartily hope that he will enable me to release him <hi rend="italic"> . </hi>    
I felt strongly tempted to set him at liberty at once; but if I   
were to begin in that way, there would be no stopping; and it   
would be doing a kindness to an individual at the expense of all   
negroes-others would expect the same; and then I   
must either contrive to cultivate my estate with fewer hands, or   
must cease to cultivate it altogether-and, from inability to    
maintain them, send my negroes to seek bread for themselves&mdash;   
which, as two-thirds of them have been born upon the estate,   
and many of them are lame, dropsical, and of great age, would,   
of all misfortunes that could happen to them, be the most cruel.    
even when Nicholas was speaking to me about his liberty, he   
said, "It is not that I wish to go away, sir; it is only for the   
name and honour of being free: but I would always stay here   
and be your servant; and I had rather be an under-workman on   
Cornwall, than a head carpenter anywhere else." Possibly this   
Was all palaver(in which the negroes are great dealers), but at   
least he  <hi rend="italic"> seemed  </hi> to be sincere ; and I was heartily grieved that I   
could not allow myself to say more to him than that I sincerely   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0057" n="38"/>
   
wished him to get his liberty, and would receive the very lowest   
exchange for him that common prudence would authorize. And   
even for those few kind words, the poor fellow seemed to think    
it impossible to find means strong enough to express his gratitude.   
</p><p>Nor is this the only instance in which Nicholas has been unlucky. It seems   
that he was the first   
lover of the beautiful   
Psyche, whom I bad noticed on my arrival. This evening,   
after the performance of the John-Canoes, I desired to see some   
of the girls dance; and by general acclamation Psyche was   
brought forward to exhibit, she being avowedly the best dancer   
on the estate ; and certainly nothing could be more light, graceful, my, and   
spirited, than her   
performance. She perfectly   
answered the description of Sallust's Sempronia, who was said   
-" Saltare elegantius, quam necesse est probae, et cui cariora   
semper omnia, quam decus et pudicitia fuit." When her dance   
was over, I called her to me, and gave her a handful of silver.   
" Ah, Psyche," said Nicholas, who was standing at my elbow,   
41 Massa no give you all that if massa know you so bad girl!   
she run away from me, massa 1 " Psyche gave him a kind of   
pouting look, half kind, and half reproachful, and turned away.   
And then he told me that Psyche had been his wife  <hi rend="italic"> (one  </hi> of his   
wives he should have said); that he had had a child by her, and ,   
then she had left him for one of my " white people " (as they   
call the book-keepers), because he had a good salary, and could   
afford to give her more presents than a slave could. " Was   
there not another reason for your quarrelling? " said my agent.   
" Was there not a shade of colour too much ? "-" Oh, massa!"   
answered Nicholas, " the child is not my own, that is certain ,   
it is a black man's child. But still I will always take care of the   
child. because it have no friends, and me wish make it good neger   
for massa-and  <hi rend="italic"> she  </hi> take good care of it too," he added, throwing his   
arm round the waist of a   
sickly-looking woman rather in   
years; " she my wife, too, massa, long ago ; old now and sick, but   
always good to me, so I still live with her, and will never leave her,   
never massa ; she Polly's mother, sir." Polly is a pretty, delicate   
looking girl, nursing a young child; she belongs to the mansion-house, and seems to think it as necessary a part of her duty to   
nurse me as the child. To be sure she has not as vet insisted   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0058" n="39"/>
   
upon suckling me; but if I open a  <hi rend="italic"> jalousie  </hi> in the evening, Polly   
walks in and shuts it without saying a word. " Oh, don't shut    
the window, Polly."-" Night-air not good for massa;" and   
she shuts the casement without mercy. I am drinking orangeade,    
or some such liquid; Polly walks up to the table, and seizes it   
" Leave that jug, Polly; I am dying with thirst."-" More   
hurt massa;"  and away go Polly and the orangeade. So that I    
begin to fancy myself  Sancho in Barataria, and that Polly is the    
senor Doctor Pedro in petticoats.   
</p><p>  
The difference of colour, which had offended Nicholas so much   
in Psyche's child, is a fault which no mulatto will pardon; nor    
can the separation of castes in India be more rigidly observed,    
than that of complexional shades among the Creoles. My black   
page, Cubina, is married: I told him that I hoped he had married a pretty   
woman ; why had he not   
married Mary Wiggins ?    
he seemed quite shocked at the very idea. " Oh, massa, me   
black, Mary Wiggins sambo; that not allowed."   
</p><p>  
The dances performed to-night seldom admitted   
more than   
three persons at a time :  to me they appeared to be movements   
entirely dictated by the caprice of the moment ; but I am told   
 that there is a regular figure, and that the, least mistake, or a   
single false step, is immediately noticed by the rest. I could   
indeed sometimes fancy that one story represented an old duenna   
guarding a girl from a lover; and another, the pursuit of a   
young woman by two suiters, the one young and the other old ;   
but this might be only fancy. However, I am told that they   
have dances which not only represent courtship and marriage,   
brought to bed. Their music consisted of nothing but   
Gambys (Eboe drums), Shaky-shekies, and Kitty-katties: the   
latter is nothing but any flat piece of board beat upon with two   
sticks, and the former is a bladder with a parcel of pebbles in it.   
But the principal part of the music to which they dance is vocal;   
one girl generally singing two lines by herself, and being   
answered by a chorus. To make out either the rhyme of the   
air, or meaning of the words, was out of the question. But one   
very long song was about the Duke of Wellington, every stanza   
being chorused with,   
   
<q><lg><l>"Ay! hey-day! Waterloo!</l>  
<l>Waterloo ! ho ! ho! ho !"</l></lg></q>  
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0059" n="40"/>
   
I too had a great deal to do in the business, for every third word    
was " massa."   
</p>   
<p>The singing began about six o'clock, and lasted, without a   
moment's pause, till two in the morning; and such a noise never   
did I hear till then. The whole of the floor which was not   
taken  <hi rend="italic"> up  </hi> by the dancers was, through every part of the house   
except the bed-rooms, occupied by men, women, and children,   
fast asleep. But although they were allowed rum and sugar by   
whole pailfuls, and were most of them  <hi rend="italic"> merry  </hi> in consequence,   
there was not one of them drunk; except, indeed, one person,   
and that was an old woman, who sang, and shouted, and tossed   
herself about in an elbow chair, till she tumbled it over, and   
rolled about the room in a manner which shocked the delicacy   
of even the least prudish part of the company. At twelve my   
agent wanted to dismiss them; but I would not suffer them to   
be interrupted on the first holiday that I had given them ; so    
they continued to dance and shout till two, when human nature   
could bear no more, and they left me to my bed, and a violent    
headache.

<p>In spite of their exertions of last night, the negroes were again   
with me by two o'clock in the day, with their drums and their    
choruses. However, they found themselves unable to keep it   
up as they had done on the former night, and were content to   
withdraw to their own houses by ten in the evening. But first   
they requested to have to-morrow to themselves, in order that   
they might go to the mountains for provisions. For although ,,   
their cottages are always surrounded with trees and shrubs, their   
provision-grounds are kept quite distinct, and are at a distance   
among the mountains. Of course, I made no difficulty of acceding to their   
request, but upon   
condition that they should ask for   
no more holidays till the crop should be completed. For the   
purpose of cultivating their provision -grounds, they are allowed   
every Saturday ; but on' the occasion of my arrival, they obtained   
permission to have the   
Saturday to themselves, and to   
fetch their week's provisions from the mountains on the following   
Monday, All the slaves   
maintain themselves in this manner   
by their own labour; even the domestic attendants are not   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0060" n="41"/>
   
exempted, but are expected to feed themselves, except stated   
 allowances of salt-fish, salt-pork, &amp;c.

<p>I really believe that the negresses can produce children at   
 pleasure; and where they are barren, it is just as hens will frequently not   
lay eggs on ship-board,   
because they do Dot like   
 their situation. Cubina's wife  <hi rend="italic"> is  </hi> in the family way, and I told    
him that if the child should live I would christen it for him, if   
 he wished it. " Tank you, kind massa, me like it very much:    
much oblige if massa do that for  <hi rend="italic"> me  </hi> too." So I promised to    
baptize the father and the baby on the same day, and said that I   
 would be godfather to any children that might be born on the    
estate during my residence in Jamaica. This was soon spread   
 about, and although I have not yet been here a week, two women   
 we in the straw already, Jug Betty and Minerva: the first  <hi rend="italic"> is </hi>    
 wife to  <hi rend="italic"> my  </hi> bead driver, the Duke of Stilly; but  <hi rend="italic"> my  </hi> sense of    
propriety was much gratified at finding that Minerva's husband   
 was called Captain.   
</p><p>  
In my evening' <hi rend="italic"> s  </hi> drive I met the negroes returning from the   
 mountains, with baskets of provisions sufficient to last them for   
 the week. By law they are only allowed every other Saturday   
 or the purpose of cultivating their own grounds, which, indeed,   
  <hi rend="italic"> is  </hi> sufficient ; but by giving them every alternate Saturday into   
 the bargain, it enables them to perform their task with so much   
 61W as almost converts it into an amusement; and the frequent   
 visiting their grounds makes them grow habitually as much    
attached to them as they are to their houses and gardens. It  <hi rend="italic"> is </hi>    
 also adviseable for them to bring home only a week's provisions    
at-is time, rather than a fortnight's ; for they are  <hi rend="italic"> so  </hi> thoughtless   
and improvident, that, when they find themselves in possession of   
a larger supply than  <hi rend="italic"> is  </hi> requisite for their immediate occasions,   
they will sell half to the wandering higglers, or at Savannah la   
Mar, in exchange for spirits ; and then, at the end of the week,    
they find themselves entirely unprovided with food, and come to   
beg a supply from the master's storehouse.   
  
</p><p>The sensitive plant is a great nuisance in Jamaica: it overruns,   
and, being armed with   
very strong sharp   
prickels it wounds the mouths of the cattle, and, in some places,   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0061" n="42"/>
   
makes it quite impossible for them to feed. Various endeavours   
have been made to eradicate this inconvenient weed, but none, as   
yet have proved effectual.

<p>The houses here are generally built and arranged according to   
one and the same model. My own is of wood, partly raised   
upon pillars; it consists of a single floor: a long gallery, called   
a piazza, terminated at each end by a square room, runs the   
whole length of the house. Oil each side of the piazza is a   
range of bed-rooms, and the porticoes of the two fronts form   
two more rooms, with balustrades, and flights of steps descending to the   
lawn. The whole house   
is virandoed with shifting   
Venetian blinds to admit air ; except that one of the end rooms   
has sash-windows on account of the rains, which, when they   
arrive, are so heavy, and shift with the wind so suddenly from   
the one side to tile. other, that all the blinds are obliged to be   
kept closed ; consequently the whole house is in total darkness   
during their continuance, except the single sash-windowed room.   
There is nothing underneath except a few store-rooms and a   
kind of waiting-hall; but none of the domestic negroes sleep in   
tile house, all going home at night to their respective cottages   
and families.   
</p><p>  
Cornwall House stands on a dead flat, and the works are built in its   
immediate neighbourhood,   
for the convenience of   
their being the more under the agent's personal inspection (a   
point of material consequence with them all, but more particularly for the   
hospital). </p>   
<p>This dead flat is only ornamented with   
a few scattered bread-fruit and cotton trees, a grove of mangoes,   
and the branch of a small river, which turns the mill. Several   
of these buildings are ugly enough; but the shops of the cooper,   
carpenter, and blacksmith, some of the trees in their vicinity,,   
and the negro-huts, embowered in shrubberies, and groves of   
oranges, plantains, cocoas, and pepper-trees, would be reek,   
picturesque in tile most ornamented grounds. A large spreading tamarind   
fronts me at this   
moment, and overshadows the   
stables, which are formed of open wickerwork; and an orangetree, loaded   
with fruit, grows   
against the window at which I am   
writing. </p>  
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0062" n="43"/>
   
<p>On three sides of the landscape the prospect is bounded by   
lofty purple mountains; and the variety of occupations going on   
all around me, and at the same time, give an inconceivable air   
of life and animation to the whole scene, especially as all those   
occupations look clean,-even those which in England look   
dirty. All the tradespeople are dressed in jackets and trousers,   
either white or of red and sky-blue stripe. One band of negroes   
an carrying the ripe canes on their heads to the mill; another   
set are conveying away the  <hi rend="italic"> trash </hi> , after the juice has been extracted   
; flocks of turkeys axe   
sheltering from the heat under the   
trees; the river is filled with ducks and geese; the coopers and   
carpenters are employed about the puncheons ; carts drawn some   
by six others by eight, oxen, are bringing loads of Indian corn   
from the fields; the black children are employed in gathering it    
into the granary, and in quarrelling with pigs as black as themselves, who   
are equally busy in   
stealing the corn whenever the   
children are looking another way: in short, a plantation possesses all the   
movement and interest   
of a farm, without its dung,   
and its stench, its dirty accompaniments.  
</p>   
</div1>  
<div1 type="section" id="d51">  
<head>JANUARY 11.</head>  
  
<p>I saw the whole process   
of sugar-making this morning. The   
ripe canes are brought in bundles to the mill, where the cleanest   
of the women are appointed, one to put them into tile machine   
for crushing them, and another to draw them out after the juice   
has been extracted, when she throws then into an opening in the   
floor close to her; another band of negroes collects them below,   
when, under the name of  <hi rend="italic"> trash </hi> , they an carried away to serve   
for fuel.  The juice, which is itself at first of a pale ash-colour,   
gushes out in great streams, quite white with foam, and passes   
through a wooden gutter into the boiling-house, where it is   
received into the siphon, or " cock-copper," where fire is applied   
to it, and it is slaked with lime, in order to make it granulate.    
The feculent parts of it rise to the top, while the purer and more   
fluid flow through another gutter into the second copper. When   
little but the impure scum on the surface remains to be drawn   
off, the first gutter communicating with the copper is stopped,   
and the grosser parts are obliged to find a new course through   
another gutter, which conveys them to the distillery, where,   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0063" n="44"/>
   
being mixed with the molasses, or treacle, they are manufactured   
into rum. From the second copper they are transmitted into   
the first, and thence into two others, and in these four latter   
basins the scum is removed with skimmers pierced with holes,   
till it becomes sufficiently free from impurities to be  <hi rend="italic"> skipped off, </hi>    
that is, to be again ladled out of the coppers and spread into the   
coolers, where it is left to granulate. The sugar is then formed,   
and is removed into the  <hi rend="italic"> curing-house,  </hi> where it is put into hogs   
heads, and left to settle for a certain time, during which those   
parts which are too poor and too liquid to granulate, drip from   
the casks into vessels placed beneath them: these drippings are   
the molasses, which, being carried into the distillery, and mixed   
with the coarser scum formerly mentioned, form that mixture   
from which the spirituous liquor of sugar is afterwards produced   
by fermentation: when but once distilled it is called "low   
wine;" and it is not till after it has gone through a second distillation, that it   
acquires the name of   
rum. The " trash " used   
for fuel consists of the empty canes: that which is employed for   
fodder and for thatching is furnished by the superabundant cane   
tops ; after so many have been set apart as are required for   
planting. After these original plants have been cut, their roots   
throw up suckers, which, in time, become canes, and are called   
 <hi rend="italic"> ratoons : they  </hi> are far inferior in juice to the planted caries ; but   
then, on the other band, they require much less weeding, and   
spare the negroes the only laborious part of the business of   
sugar-making, the digging holes for the plants; therefore,   
although an acre of ratoons will produce but one hogshead of   
sugar, while an acre of plants will produce two, the superiority   
of the ratooned piece is very great, inasmuch as the saving of   
time and labour will enable the proprietor to cultivate five acres   
of ratoons in the same time with one of plants. Unluckily, after   
three crops, or five at the utmost, in general the ratoons are   
totally exhausted, and you are obliged to have recourse to fresh   
plants.

Last night a poor man named Charles, who bad been coachman to my   
uncle ages ago, was   
brought into the hospital, having   
missed a step in the boiling-house, and plunged his foot into the   
siphon : fortunately, the fire had not long been kindled, and   
though the liquor was hot enough to scald him, it was not sufficiently   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0064" n="45"/>
   
so to do him any material injury. The old man had presented to me on   
Saturday's holiday (or   
 <hi rend="italic"> play-day </hi> , in the   
negro dialect), and had shown me, with great exultation, the   
coat and waistcoat which had been the last present of his old    
massa. Charles is now my chief mason, and, as one of the principal   
persons on the estate, was   
entitled, by old custom, to the   
compliment of a  <hi rend="italic"> distinguishing  </hi> dollar  <hi rend="italic"> on  </hi> my arrival; but at   
the   
some time that I gave him the dollar to which his situation entitled him, I   
gave him another for   
himself, as a keepsake: he   
put it into the pocket of " his old massa's" waistcoat, and assured   
me that they should never again be separated. On hearing of his   
accident I went over to the hospital to see that he was well   
taken care of;  and immediately the poor fellow began talking   
to me about my grandfather and his young massa, and the young   
missies, his sisters, and while I suffered him to chatter away for    
an hour, he totally forgot the pain of his burnt leg.   
</p>   
<p>It was  particularly agreeable to me to observe on Saturday,   
as a proof of the good treatment which they had experienced, so   
many old servants of the family, many of whom bad been born   
on the estate, and who, though turned of sixty and seventy, were   
still strong, healthy, and cheerful. Many manumitted negroes   
came from other parts of the country to this festival on   
hearing of my arrival, because, as they said-" if they did not   
come to see massa, they were afraid that it would look ungrateful, and as if   
they cared no longer   
about him and Cornwall now    
that they were free." So they stayed two or three days on the   
estate, coming up to the house for their dinners, and going to   
sleep at night among their friends in their own former habitations, the   
negro huts ; and when they   
went away they assured   
me that nothing should prevent their coming back to bid me   
farewell before I left the island. </p>   
<p>All this may be palaver; but   
certainly they at least play their parts with such an air of truth,   
and warmth, and enthusiasm, that after the cold hearts and repulsive   
manners of England, the   
contrast is infinitely agreeable.   
   
  
<q>"Je ne vois que des yeux toujours pret a sourire."</q>  
   
</p>   
<p>I find it quite impossible to resist the fascination of the conscious   
pleasure of pleasing; and   
my heart, which I have so long   
been obliged to keep closed, seems to expand itself again in the   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0065" n="46"/>
   
sunshine of the kind looks and words which meet me, at every   
turn, and seem to wait for mine as anxiously as if they were so,   
many diamonds.

<head>JANUARY 12. </head>  
  
<p>In the year '80, this parish of Westmoreland was kept in a   
perpetual state of alarm by a runaway negro called Plato, who   
had established himself among the Moreland mountains, and collected a   
troop of banditti, of   
which he was himself the chief.    
He robbed very often, and murdered occasionally; but gallantry   
was his every day occupation. Indeed, being a remarkably tall    
athletic young fellow, among the beauties of his own complexion   
he found but few Lucretias ; and his retreat in the mountains   
was as well furnished as the harem of Constantinople. Every   
handsome negress who had the slightest cause of complaint   
against her master, took the first opportunity of eloping to join   
Plato, where she found freedom, protection, and unbounded   
generosity ; for he spared no pains to secure their affections by   
gratifying their vanity. Indeed, no Creole lady could venture   
out on a visit without running the risk of having her bandbox   
run away with by Plato for the decoration of his sultanas; and   
if the maid who carried the bandbox happened to be well-looking,   
he ran away with the maid as well as the bandbox. Every endeavour to   
seize this desperado was   
long in vain : a large reward   
was, put upon his head, but no negro dared to approach him;   
for, besides his acknowledged courage, he was a professor of Obi,   
and had threatened that whoever dared to lay a finger upon him   
should suffer spiritual torments, as well as be physically shot   
through the head.   
</p>   
<p>Unluckily for Plato, rum was an article with him of the first   
necessity; the look-out which was kept for him was too vigilant   
to admit of his purchasing spirituous liquors for himself; and    
once, when for that purpose he had ventured into the neighbourhood of   
Montego Bay, he was   
recognised by a slave, who immediately gave the alarm. Unfortunately for   
this poor fellow,   
whose name was Taffy, at that moment all his companions happened to be   
out of bearing; and,   
after the first moment's alarm,   
finding that no one approached the exasperated robber rushed   
upon him, and lifted the bill-hook with which he was armed,   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0066" n="47"/>
   
for the purpose of cleaving his skull.  Taffy fled for it; but   
Plato was the younger, the stronger, and the swifter of the two,  
and gained upon him every moment. Taffy, however on the,    
other hand, possessed that one quality by which, according to   
fable, the cat was enabled to save herself from the hounds,   
when the fox, with his thousand tricks, was caught by them. He   
was an admirable climber, an art in which Plato possessed no    
skill ; and a bread-nut tree, which is remarkably difficult of   
ascent, presenting itself before him, in a few moments Taffy was   
bawling for help from the very top of it. To reach him was   
impossible for his enemy; but still his destruction was hard at   
hand, for Plato began to hack the tree with his bill; and it was   
evident that a very short space of time would be sufficient to   
level it with the ground. In this dilemma Taffy had nothing   
for it but to break off the branches near him, and he contrived   
to pelt these so dexterously at the head of his assailant, that he   
fairly kept him at bay till his cries at length reached the ears of   
his companions, and their approach compelled the banditti-captain once   
more to seek safety   
among the mountains.   
</p>   
<p>After this Plato no longer dared to approach Montego town ;   
but still spirits must be had-how was he to obtain them ? There   
was an old watchman on the outskirts of the estate of Canaan,    
with whom he had contracted an acquaintance, and frequently   
had passed the night in his hut; the old man having been    
equally induced by his presents and by dread of his corporeal   
strength and supposed supernatural power, to profess the warmest   
attachment to the interests of   
his terrible friend  To this   
man Plato at length resolved to entrust himself. He gave him   
money to purchase spirits, and appointed a particular day when   
he would come to receive them. The reward placed upon the   
robber'shead was more than either gratitude or terror could   
counterbalance; and on the same day when the watchman set   
out to purchase the rum, he apprised two of his friends at Canaan for   
whose use it was intended,   
and advised  <hi rend="italic"> them </hi>  to take the   
opportunity  of obtaining the reward.   
</p><p>  
The two negroes posted themselves in proper time near the   
watchman's hut. Most unwisely, instead of sending down some   
of his gang, Plato, in his full confidence in the friendship of his   
confidant, himself entered the cabin. but so great was their   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0067" n="48"/>
   
alarm at seeing this dreadful parsonage, that they remained in   
 their concealment, nor dared to make an attempt at seizing him.   
   
The spirits were delivered to the robber: he might have   
retired with them unmolested, but in his rashness and his eager   
Wt   
   
taste the liquor, of which he had so long been deprived, he   
opened the flagon, and swallowed draught after draught, till he   
sank upon the ground in a state of complete insensibility. The   
 watchman then summoned the two negroes from their concealment,    
who bound his arms, and conveyed him to Montego Bay,   
where he was immediately sentenced to execution. He died   
most heroically; kept up the terrors of his imposture to his last   
moment; told the magistrates who "condemned him that his   
death should be revenged by a storm which would lay waste the   
whole island that year; and when his negro jailer was binding   
him to the stake at which he was destined to suffer, he assured   
him that he should not live long to triumph in his death, for.   
that he had taken good care to Obeah him before his quitting   
the prison. It certainly did happen, strangely enough, that before    
the year was over, the most violent storm took place ever   
known in Jamaica; and as to the jailer, his imagination was so   
forcibly struck by the threats of the dying man, that although   
every care was taken of him, the power of medicine exhausted,   
and even a voyage to America undertaken, in hopes that a change   
of scene might change the course of his ideas, still, from the moment of  
Plato's death, he gradually pined 'and withered   
and finally expired before the completion of the twelvemonth.  
</p>  
<p>The belief in Obeah is now greatly weakened, but still exists    
in some degree. Not above ten months ago my agent was in- formed that a negro of very suspicious manners and appearance   
 was harboured by some of my people on the mountain an   
( He found means to have him surprised, and on examination   
there was found upon him a bag containing a great variety of   
strange materials for incantations ; such as thunder-stones, cat's   
ears, the feet of various animals, human hair, fish bones, the teeth   
 of alligators, &amp;c. He was conveyed to Montego Bay, and no   
sooner was it understood that this old African was in prison,    
than depositions were poured in from all quarters from n   
who testified to having seen him exercise his magical arts, and   
in particular, to his having sold such and such slaves medicines   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0068" n="49"/>
   
and charms to deliver them from their enemies ; being, in plain   
English, nothing less than rank poisons.  He was convicted of   
Obeah upon the most indubitable evidence.  The good old practice of   
burning has fallen into   
disrepute, so he was sentenced to   
be transported, and was shipped off the island, to the great   
satisfaction of persons of all colours-white, black, and yellow.   
   
</p>   
</div1>  
<div1 type="section" id="d53">  
<head>JANUARY13. </head>  
  
<p>Throughout the island many estates, formerly very flourishing   
 and productive, have been thrown up for want of hands to cultivate them,   
and are now suffered   
to lie waste: four in my own   
 immediate neighbourbood are in this situation. Finding their   
complement of negroes decrease, and having no means of recruiting them,   
proprietors of two   
estates have in numerous instances   
 found themselves obliged to give up one of them, and draw off   
 the negroes for the purpose of properly cultivating the other.   
</p><p>  
I have just had an instance strikingly convincing of the extreme care   
required in rearing negro   
children. Two have -been   
 born since my arrival. Ally housekeeper was hardly ever out of   
the lying-in apartment; I always visited it myself once a day,   
and sometimes twice, in order that I might be certain of the   
women being well taken care of. Not a day passed without the   
inspection of a physician ; nothing of indulgence that was proper   
for them was denied ; and besides their ordinary food, the mothers   
received every day the most   
nourishing and palatable dish   
that was brought to my own table. Add to this, that the women   
themselves were kind-hearted creatures, and particularly anxious   
:to rear these children, because I had promised to be their god-father myself. Yet in spite of all this attention and indulgence,    
one of the mothers, during the nurse's absence for ten minutes,   
 grew alarmed at her infant's apparent sleepiness.   
</p><p>To rouse it   
she began dancing and shaking it till it was in a strong perspiration, and   
then she stood with it for   
some minutes at an open   
window while a strong north wind was blowing.  In consequence, it caught   
cold, and the next   
morning symptoms of a   
locked jaw showed themselves. The poor woman was the image   
grief itself: she sat on her bed, looking at the child which lay   
 by h side with its little hands clasped, its teeth set, and its eyes   
writhing in the agony of the spasm, while she was herself   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0069" n="50"/>
   
quite motionless and speechless, although the tears trickled down   
 her cheeks incessantly. All assistance was fruitless ; her thoughtlessness   
for five minutes had   
killed the infant, and at noon to-day it expired.   
</p><p>  
This woman was a tender mother, had borne ten children, and   
 yet has now but one alive : another, at p. vent in the hospital,   
has-borne seven, and but one has lived to puberty ; and the instances of   
those who have had   
four, five, six children, without   
succeeding in bringing up one, in spite of the utmost attention   
and indulgence, are very numerous; so heedless and inattentive   
are the best intentioned mothers, and so subject in this climate   
are infants to dangerous complaints. The locked jaw is the   
common and most fatal one; so fatal, indeed, that the midwife   
(the  <hi rend="italic"> graundee is  </hi> her negro appellation) told me, the other day,   
" 0h, massa, till nine days over, we no hope of them." Certainly care and   
kindness, on the part of   
the planters, are not'   
adequate to save the children ; for the son of a sovereign could   
not have been more anxiously well treated than was the poor   
little negro who died this morning.   
</p><p>  
The negroes are always buried in their own gardens, and many'   
strange and fantastical ceremonies are observed on the occasion.   
 If the corpse be that of a grown-tip person, they consult it as to   
 which way it pleases to be -carried,; and they make attempts   
 upon various roads without success, before they can bit upon the   
 right one. Till that is accomplished, they stagger under the    
weight of the coffin, struggle against its force, which draws them   
 in a different direction from that in which they bad settled to   
 go; and sometimes in the contest the corpse and the coffin jump   
 off the shoulders of the bearers. No if, as is frequently the    
case, any person is suspected of having hastened the catastrophe,   
 the corpse will then refuse to go any road but the one which passes   
 by the habitation of the suspected person, and as soon as it approaches his   
house, Do human   
power is equal to persuading it to   
 pass. As the negroes are extremely superstitious, and very much   
 afraid of ghosts (whom they call the duppy), I rather wonder at   
 their choosing-to have their dead buried in their gardens; but    
I understand their argument to be, that they need only fear    
the duppies of their enemies, but have nothing to apprehend    
from those after death who loved them in their lifetime; but   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0070" n="51"/>
   
the duppies of their adversaries are very alarming beings,   
equally powerful by day as by night, and are not only spiritually terrific,   
but  can give very hard   
substantial knocks on the   
pate, whenever they see fit occasion, and can find a good opportunity.   
</p>   
<p>Last Saturday a negro was brought into the hospital, having   
fallen into epileptic fits, with which till then he had never been   
troubled.  As the faintings seized him at the slaughterhouse, and the fellow   
was an African, it was   
at first supposed by   
his companions, that the sight and smell of the meat had affected   
him; for many of the Africans cannot endure animal food of   
any kind, and most of the Ebres in particularcare are made ill by   
eating turtle, even although they can use any other food without   
injurt. However,  upon inquiry among his shipmates, it ap-peared that he had frequently eaten beef without the slightest   
inconvenience. For my own part, the symptoms of his complaint were   
such as to make me   
suspect him of having tasted   
something poisonous, especially as, just before his first fit, he   
had been observed in the small grove of mangoes near the house;   
but I was assured by the negroes, one and all, that nothing could   
possibly have induced him to eat</p>   
<p> an herb or fruit from that grove,   
as it had been used as a buryig-ground for " the white people."   
But although my idea of the poison was scouted, still the mention of the   
burying-ground   
suggested another cause for his illness to the negroes, and they had no sort   
of doubt, that in   
passing   
through the burying-ground he had been struck down by the   
duppy of a white person not long deceased, whom he had formerly   
offended, and that these   
repeated fainting-fits were the   
consequence of that ghostly blow. The negroes have in various   
publications been accused of a total want of religion, but this    
appears to me quite incompatible with the ideas of spirits existing after   
dissolution of the body,   
which necessarily implies a    
belief in a future state ; and although (as far as I can make out)   
they have no outward forms of religion, the most devout Christian cannot   
have " God bless you "   
oftener on his lips than the   
negro.   
</p><p>  
The Africans generally believe that there is a life beyond the   
 present, and that they shall enjoy it by returning to their own   
 country ; and this idea used frequently to induce them, soon after   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0071" n="52"/>
   
their landing in the colonies, to commit suicide; but this was   
 never known to take place except among fresh negroes, and   
 since the execrable slave-trade has been abolished, such an illusion is   
unheard of. As to those   
who had once got over de    
dreadful period of " seasoning," they were generally soon sensible enough   
of the amelioration of   
their condition to make the   
 idea of returning to Africa the most painful that could be presented to   
them. But, to be sure, poor   
creatures! what with the   
 terrors and sufferings of the voyage, and the unavoidable hardships of the   
seasoning, those   
advantages were purchased more   
 dearly than any in this life can possibly be worth. God be   
 thanked, all that is now at an end; and certainly, as far as I    
can as yet judge, if I were now standing on the banks of Lethe,   
 with a goblet of the waters of oblivion in my hand, and asked   
 whether I chose to enter life anew as an English labourer or a   
 Jamaica negro, I should have no hesitation in preferring the   
 latter. For myself, it appears to me almost worth surrendering   
 the luxuries and pleasures of Great Britain, for the single pleasure of   
being surrounded with   
beings who are always laughing   
 and singing, and who seem to perform their work with so much   
  <hi rend="italic"> nonchalance,  </hi> taking up their baskets as if it were perfectly   
optional whether they took them up   
or left them there; sauntering   
 along with their hands dangling; stopping to -chat with every   
 one they meet; or if they meet no one, standing still to look   
 round, and examine whether there is nothing to be seen that can,   
amuse them ; so that I can hardly persuade myself that it is really   
 <hi rend="italic"> work </hi>  that they are about.   
</p><p>  
I am told that there is one part of their business very laborious, digging   
holes for the receiving of   
cane-plants, which I   
have not as yet seen ; but this does not occupy above a month   
at the utmost, at two periods of the year ; and on my estate this   
service is chiefly performed by extra negroes, hired for the purpose ;   
which, although equally   
hard in the hired negroes(called   
a jobbing gang), at least relieves my own, and after all puts even   
the former on much the same footing with English day-labourers.   
</p><p>  
But if I could contend to live in Jamica, I am still   
more   
certain that it is the only agreeable place for me to die in ; for   
I have got a family mausoleum, which looks for all the world   
like the theatrical representation of the "tomb of all Capulets."  
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0072" n="53"/>
   
Its outside is most plentifully decorated " with sculptured   
 stones,"-" arms, angels, epitaphs, and bones. Within is a   
tomb of the purest white marble, raised on a platform of ebony ;    
the building, which is surmounted by a statue of Time, with his   
scythe and hour-glass, stands in the very heart of an orange-grove, now in full bearing ; and the whole scene this morning   
looked so cool, so tranquil, and so gay, and is so perfectly divested of all   
vestiges of dissolution,   
that the sight of it quite    
gave me an appetite for being buried. It is a matter of perfect   
indifference to me what becomes of this little ugly husk of mine,    
when once I have " shuffled off this mortal coil ;" or else   
I should follow my grandfather's example, and, die   
where I might, order my body to be sent over for burial to   
Cornwall ; for I never yet saw a place where one could lie down    
more comfortably to listen for the last trumpet.

</div1>  
<div1 type="section" id="d54">  
<head>JANUARY  <hi rend="italic"> 14. (Sunday.) </hi>  </head>  
  
<p>I gave a dinner to my " white people," as the book-keepers,   
&amp;c., are called here, and who have a separate houses and   
establishment for themselves ; and   
certainly a man must be destitute of   
every spark of hospitality, and have had " Caucasus horrens"   
for his great-grandmother, if he can resist giving dinners in a   
country where Nature seems to have set up a superior kind of   
" London Tavern " of her own. They who are possessed by the   
"Ciborum ambitiosa fames, et lautaegloria mensae," ought to   
ship themselves off Jamaica out of hand ; and even the lord   
mayor himself need not blush to give his alderman such a dinner    
as is placed on my table, even when I dine alone. Land and sea   
turtle, quails, snipes, plovers, and pigeons and doves of all descriptions -of which the ring-tale   
has been allowed rank with   
the most exquisite of the winged species, by epicures of such distinction,   
that their opinion, in   
matters of this nature, almost   
carries with it the weight of a law,-excellent pork, barbecued    
pigs, pepper-pots, with numberless other excellent dishes, from   
the ordinary fare ; the poultry also is miraculously large and   
fine.  Then our tarts are made of pine-apples, and pine-apples   
make the best tarts that I ever tasted ; there is no end to the   
variety of fruits, of which the shaddock is "in itself a host;"   
but the most singular and exquisite flavor, perhaps, is to be   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0073" n="54"/>
   
found in the granadillo, a fruit which grows upon a species of   
 vine, and, in fact, appears to be a kind of cucumber. It must    
be suffered to hang till it is dead ripe, when it is scarcely anything except   
juice and seeds, which   
can only be eaten with a   
 spoon. It requires sugar, but the acid is truly delicious, and    
like up other separate flavour that I ever met with; what it most   
 resembles is a  <hi rend="italic"> macedoine,  </hi> as it unites the different tastes of almost   
 all other fruits, and has, at the same time, a very strong flavour    
of wine.   
</p><p>  
As to fish, Savannah la Mar is reckoned , the best place in the   
 island, both for variety and  <hi rend="italic"> safety;  </hi> for, in many parts, the fish    
feed upon copperas-banks, and cannot be used without much precaution ;   
here, none is   
necessary: and it is only to be wished that   
 their names were somewhat more attractive ; for it must be    
owned, that nothing can be less tempting than the sound of Jew-fish, hog-fish, mud-fish, snappers, god-dammies, groupas, and    
grunts ! Of the sea-fish which I have hitherto met with, the Deepwater Silk   
appears to me the   
best ; and of river-fish, the mountain-mullet: but, indeed, the fish is generally so excellent, and in    
such profusion, that I never sit down to table without wishing    
for the company of Queen Atygatis of Scythia, who was so particularly   
fond of fish, that she   
prohibited all her subjects from    
eating it on pain of death, through fear that there might not be    
enough left for her majesty.   
</p>   
<p>This fondness for fish seems to be a sort of royal passion :   
more than one of our English sovereigns died of eating too many   
 lampreys ; though, to own the truth, it was suspected that the    
monks, in one or two instances, improved the same by the addition of a   
little ratsbane ; and   
Mirabeau assures us, that Frederick    
the Second of Prussia might have prolonged his existence, if he    
could but have resisted the fascination of an eel-pie ; but the    
charm was too strong for him, and, like the great-grandmother    
of us all, he ate and died-" All for eel-pye, or this world well   
lost!"   
</p>   
<p>The provision-grounds of the negroes furnish them with plantains,   
bananas, cocoa-nuts, and   
yams : of the latter there is a    
regular harvest once a-year, and they remain in great perfection   
for many months, provided they are dug up carefully, but the    
slightest wound with the spade is sufficient to rot them.  Catalue  
  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0074" n="55"/>
   
(a species of spinach) is a principal article in their pepper-pots;    
but in this parish their most valuable and regular supply of food    
arises from the cocoa-finger, or coccos, a species of -the yam,    
which lasts all the year round. These vegetables form the basis    
of negro sustenance ; but the slaves also receive from their    
owners a regular weekly allowance of red herrings and salt meat,   
 which serve to give a relish to their vegetable diet; and, indeed,   
they are passionately fond of salted provisions, that, instead of   
 giving them fresh beef (as at their festival of Saturday last), I    
have been obliged to provide some hogsheads of salt fish, as    
likely to afford them more gratification.

 <hi rend="italic"> mustee </hi> - <hi rend="italic"> fino </hi> ; and the children of a musteefinio are free by law, and   
rank as white persons to all intents and purposes. I think it is    
Long who asserts, that two mulattoes will never have children ;   
but, as far as the most positive assurances can go, since my arrival in   
Jamaica, I have reason to   
believe the contrary, and that    
mulattoes breed together just as well as blacks and whites; but   
they are almost universally weak and effeminate persons, and    
thus their children are very difficult to rear. On a sugar-estate   
one black is considered as more than equal to two mulattoes.   
Beautiful as are their forms in general, and easy and graceful as    
are their movements (which, indeed, appear to me so striking   
that they cannot fail to excite the admiration of any one who has   
ever looked with delight on statues), still the women of colour    
are deficient in one of the most requisite points of female beauty.   
Young or old, I have not yet seen such a thing as a bosom.

<p>I never witnessed on the stage a scene so   
picturesque as a    
negro village.  I walked through my own to-day, and visited    
the houses of the drivers, and other principal persons ; and if I    
were to decide according to my own taste, I should infinitely   
have preferred their habitations to my own.  Each house is   
  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0075" n="56"/>
   
surrounded by a separate garden, and the whole village is intersected   
 by lanes, bordered with all kinds of sweet-smelling and flowering plants;   
but not such gardens as   
those belonging to our English cottagers, where a few cabbages and   
carrots-just peep up   
 and grovel upon the earth between hedges, in square narrow beds,   
 and where the tallest tree is a gooseberry bush: the vegetables   
 of the negroes are all -cultivated in their provision-grounds,   
 which form their  <hi rend="italic"> kitchen-gardens ; but  </hi> these are all for ornament    
-or luxury, and are filled with a profusion of oranges, shaddocks,    
cocoa-nuts, and peppers of all descriptions: in particular I was    
shown the abba, or palm-tree, resembling the cocoa-tree, but    
much more beautiful, as its leaves are larger and more numerous,   
land, feathering to the ground as they grow old, they form a kind   
of natural arbour. It bears a large fruit, or rather vegetable,   
 towards the top of the tree, in shape like the cone of the pine,   
 but formed of seeds, some scarlet and bright as coral, others of    
a brownish-red or purple. The abba requites a length of years    
to arrive at maturity : a very fine one, which was, shown me    
this morning, was supposed to be upwards of a hundred years old;   
 and one of a very moderate size had been planted at the least    
twenty years, and bad only borne fruit once.   
</p><p>  
It appears to me a strong proof of the good treatment which    
the negroes on Cornwall have been accustomed to receive, that   
 there are many very old people upon it; I saw to-day a woman   
 near a hundred years of age; and I am told that there are several of sixty,   
seventy, and eighty. I   
was glad also to find, that    
several negroes who have obtained their freedom, and possess    
little properties of their own in the mountains and at Savannah    
la Mar, look upon my estate so little as the scene of their former    
sufferings while slaves, that they frequently come down to pass a    
few days in their ancient habitations with their former companions, by   
way of relaxation. One   
woman in particular ex pressed her hopes that I should not be offended at   
her still   
coming to Cornwall now and then, although she belonged to it   
no longer; and begged me to give directions before my return   
to England, that her visits should not be hindered on the grounds   
of her having no business there.   
</p>   
<p>My visit. to Jamaica has at least produced one advantage to   
myself. Several runaways, who had disappeared for some time   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0076" n="57"/>
   
(some even for several months), have again made their appearance in the   
field, and I have desired   
that no questions should be asked. On the other band, one of my ladies,   
after enjoying her   
self during the Saturday and Sunday, which were allowed for   
holidays on my arrival, chose to  <hi rend="italic"> pull foot </hi> , and did not return   
from her hiding-place in the mountains till this morning. In   
excuse for her disappearance she alleged that her husband had    
called her " a very bad woman," which had provoked her so much,    
that she could not bear to stay with him ; and she assured me,   
that he was himself "a very bad man;" which, if true, was   
 certainly enough to justify any lady, black or white, in making    
a little incognito excursion for a week or so ; therefore, as it    
appeared to be nothing more than a conjugal quarrel, and as she   
engaged never to run away any more (at the same time allowing   
 that she had suffered her resentment to carry her too far, when   
it had carried her all the way to the mountains), I desired that    
an act of oblivion might be passed in her favour, and away she   
 went, quite happy, to pick hogs' meat.   
</p>   
<p>The negro houses are composed of wattles on the outside, with   
rafters of sweet-wood, and are plastered within and whitewashed ;   
they consist of two chambers, one for cooking and the other for   
sleeping, and are, in general, well furnished with chairs; tables,   
&amp;c., and I saw none without a four-post bedstead and plenty of   
bed-clothes ; for, in spite of the warmth of the climate, when   
the sun is  not above the horizon the negro always feels very   
chilly.  I am assured that many of my slaves are very rich, and   
that they are never without salt provisions, porter, and even   
wine, to entertain their friends and their visiters from the bay or   
the mountains.  As I passed though the grounds, many little   
requests were preferred to me : one wanted an additional supply   
of lime for the whitewashing of his house ; another was building a    
new house for a superannuated wife(or they have all so much   
decency as to call their tender attachments by a conjugal name),   
and wanted a little assistance towards the finishing it ; a third   
requested a new axe to work with ; and several entreated me to   
negotiate the purchase of some relation or friend belonging to      
          
another estate, and with whom they were anxious to be reunited :   
but all their requests were for additional indulgences ; not one   
complained of ill-treatment, or over-work.   
</p>  
  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0077" n="58"/>
   
<p>Poor Nicholas gave me a fresh instance of his being one of   
those whom Fortune pitches upon to show her spite: he has had   
four children, none of whom are alive; the eldest of them,   
a fine little girl of four years old, fell into the mill-stream, and   
was drowned before any one was aware of her danger. His   
wife told me that she had had fifteen children, had taken the   
utmost care of them, and yet had now but two alive: she said,   
indeed, fifteen at first, but she afterwards corrected herself, and   
explained that she had " twelve whole children and three half   
ones;" by which she meant miscarriages.   
</p><p>  
 Besides the profits arising from their   
superabundance of pro-visions, which the better sort of negroes are enabled to sell   
regularly once a week at Savannah la Afar to a considerable   
amount, they keep a large stock of poultry, and pigs without   
number ; which latter cost their owners but little, though they   
cost me a great, deal; for they generally make their way into the   
cane-pieces, and sometimes eat me up a hogshead of sugar in   
the course of the morning: but the most expensive of the   
planter's enemies are the rats, whose numbers are incredible ;    
they are so destructive that a reward is given for killing them.</p>   
   
<p>During the last six months my agent has paid for three thousand    
rats killed upon Cornwall.  Nor is the loss of the sugar they   
consume the greatest evil ; the worst mischief is, that if,    
through the carelessness of those whose business it is to supply   
the mill, one cane which has been gnawed by the rats is allowed   
admittance, that single damaged piece will produce acidity   
enough to spoil the whole sugar.

In this country there is scarcely any twilight, and all nature   
seems to wake at the same moment. About six o'clock the    
darkness disperses, the sun rises, and instantly everything is in   
motion : the negroes are going to the field, the cattle are driving    
to pasture, the pigs and the poultry are pouring out from their   
hutches, the old women are preparing food on the lawn for the   
 <hi rend="italic"> pickaninnies </hi> , whom they keep feeding at all hours of the day ;   
and all seem to be going to their employments, none to their       
work, the men and the women just as quietly and leisurely as the   
pigs and the poultry. The sight is really quite gay and amusing,   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0078" n="59"/>
   
and I am generally out of bed in time to enjoy it, especially as   
the continuance of the cool north breezes renders the weather   
still delicious, though the pleasure is rather expensive one   
Not a drop of rain has fallen since the 16<hi rend="super">th</hi> of November;   
the young canes are burning ; and the drying quality of these   
"norths" is still more detrimental  than the want of rain, so that    
winds may be said to blow my pockets inside out ; and as   
every draught of air, which I inhale with so much pleasure, is   
estimated to cost me a guinea, I feel, while breething it, like   
Miss Barney's Citizen at Vauxhall, who kept muttering to himself, with   
every bit of ham that he   
put into his mouth, "There   
Goes sixpence , and there goes a shilling.

<p>A Galli-wasp, which is killed in the neighbouring morass,   
has just been brought to me.  This is the alligator in miniature,   
and is even more dreaded by the negroes than its great elation :    
it is only to be found in swamps and morasses : that which was   
brought to me was about eighteen inches in length, and I understand that it   
is seldom longer,   
although it grows in years, its                           
thickness and the size of its jaws and head become greatly increased.  It   
runs away on being   
encountered, and conceals   
itself; and it is only dangerous if trampled upon by accident,   
or if attacked ; but then its bite is dreadful, not only from its   
tongue being armed with a sting (the venom of which is very   
powerful, although not mortal), but from its teeth being so   
brittle that they generally break in the wound, and as it is   
hardly possible to extract the pieces entirely, the wound corrupts,   
and becomes an incurable sore of the most offensive nature.   
Luckily these reptiles are very scarce ; but  nothing can exceed   
the terror and aversion in which they are held by the negroes.   
This one had been lying dead in the room for several hours, yet,   
on my servants accidently stirring the board on which it was   
stretched for my inspection, my little negro servant George   
darted out of the room in terror, and was at the bottom of the   
staircase in a moment.  the skin of this animal was like   
shagreen in appearance and strength, and was almost entirely   
composed of layers if very small scales ; the colours were   
brownish-yellow and olive-green, the teeth and piercing   
                                     
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0079" n="60"/>
   
and the claws of the feet very long and sharp: altogether it   
is a hideous and disgusting creature.  As to the alligator of   
Jamaica, it is a timid anima, which never was known to attack   
the human species, though it frequently takes the liberty of running away   
with a dog or two,   
which appear to be their venison   
and turtle.  There is no river on my estate large enough for   
them to inhabit ; but, in Paradise River, which is not above four   
miles off, I understand that they are numerous.

<p>A young mulatto carpenter, belonging to Horace Beckford's    
estate of Shrewsbury, came to beg my intercession with his overseer. le   
had been absent two days   
without leave, and on these    
occasions if is customary for the slaves to apply to some neighbouring   
gentleman. for a note in   
their behalf, which, as I Am    
told, never fails to obtain the pardon required, as the managers   
of estates are in general but too happy to find an excuse for   
passing over without punishment any offenses which are not very   
heinous. Indeed, what with the excellent laws already enacted    
for the protection a the slaves, and which are every year still    
further ameliorated, and what with the difficulty of procuring   
more negroes-which can now only be done by purchasing    
them from other estates, -making it absolutely necessary' for   
the managers to preserve the slaves, if, they mean to preserve   
their own situations, -1 am fully persuaded that instances of   
tyranny to negroes are now very rare, at least in this island.    
But I must still acknowledge, from my own sad experience, since   
my arrival, that unless a West Indian proprietor occasionally    
visits his estates himself, it  <hi rend="italic"> is  </hi> utterly impossible for him to be    
 <hi rend="italic"> certain  </hi> that his deputed authority  <hi rend="italic"> is  </hi> not abused, however   
good   
may be his intentions, and however vigilant his anxiety.  
</p><p>  
My father was one of the most humane and generous persons   
that ever existed ; there was no indulgence which he ever denied   
his negroes, and his letters were filled with the most positive    
injunctions for their good treatment.  When his estates became   
mine, the one upon which I am now residing was managed by   
an attorney, considerably advanced in years, who had been   
long in our employment, and bore the highest character for    
probity and humanity.  he was both attorney and overseer;   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0080" n="61"/>
   
and it was a particular recommendation to me that he live in   
my own house , and therefore had my slaves so immediately under   
his eye, that it was impossible for any subaltern to misuse them   
without his knowledge.  His letters to me expressed the greatest   
anxiety and attention respecting the welfare and comfort of the   
slaves;-so much so, indeed, that when I detailed his mode of    
management to Lord Holland, he observed , " that is he did all   
that was mentioned in his letters, he did as much as could possibly be   
expected or wished from   
an attorney ;" and, on parting   
with his own, Lord Holland was induced to engage mine to manage   
his estates, which are in the immediate neighbourhood of Cornwall.  this   
man dies about two   
years ago, and since my arrival,   
I happened to hear that, during his management, a remarkably   
fine young penn-keeper, named Richard (the brother of my intelligent   
carpenter, Jogn Fuller),   
had run away several times to   
the mountains.  I had taken occasion to let the brothers know,   
between jest and earnest, that I was aware of Richard's misconduct ; and at   
length, one morning,   
John, while he blamed his   
brother's running away, let fall, that he had some excuse in the   
extreme ill-usage which he had received from one of the book-keepers, who 'had had a spite against him."  The hint alarmed   
me ; I followed it, and nothing could equal my anger and surprise at   
learning the whole truth.   
</p><p>  
It seemed, that while I fancied my attorney to be   
resident on    
Cornwall, he was, in fact, generally attending to a property of    
his own, or looking after estates if which also he had the management in   
distant parts of the   
island.  During his absence , an   
overseer of his own appointing, without my knowledge, was left   
in absolute possession of his ower, which he abused to such a   
degree, that almost every slave of respectability on the estate   
was compelled to become a runaway.  The property was nearly   
ruined, and the slaves absolutely in a state of rebellion.  At    
length he committed an act if such severity, that the negroes,   
one and all, fled to Savannah la Mar, and threw themselves upon     
the protection of the magistrates, who immediately came over to   
 Cornwall and investigated the complaint ; and   
now, at length, the   
attorney, who had known numerous instances of the overseer's   
tyranny, had frequently rebuked him for them, and had redressed   
the suffers, but who still had dared to abuse my confidence so   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0081" n="62"/>
   
grossly as to continue him in his situation, upon this public exposure   
thought proper to dismiss   
him. Yet, while all this was   
going on-while my negroes were groaning under the iron rod   
 of this petty tyrant-and while the magistrate was obliged to   
 interfere to protect them from his cruelty-my attorney had the    
insolence and falsehood, to write me letters, filled with assurances   
of his perpetual vigilance for their welfare, and of their perfect   
good treatment and satisfaction; and, if I had not come myself   
to Jamaica, in all probability I should never have had the most    
distant idea how abominably the poor creatures had been ill-used.   
</p>   
<p>I have made it my business to mix as much as possible among   
the negroes, and have given them every encouragement to repose   
 confidence in me ; and I have uniformly found all those, upon   
 whom any reliance can be placed, unite in praising the humanity   
 of their present superintendent. Instantly on his arrival he took   
 the whole power of punishment into his own hands: he forbade.   
the slightest interference in this respect of any person whatever   
on the estate, white or black; nor have I been able to find as   
yet any one negro who has any charge of harsh treatment to   
bring against him. However, having been already so grossly deceived, I   
will never again place   
implicit confidence in any person,   
whatever in a matter of such importance. Before my departure,   
I shall take every possible measure that may prevent any mis-conduct   
taking place without my   
being apprised of it as soon as   
possible ; and I have already exhorted my negroes to apply to   
the magistrates on the very first instance of ill-usage, should any   
occur during my absence.   
</p><p>I am indeed assured by every one about me, that to manage a   
West Indian estate without the occasional use of the cart-whip   
however rarely, is impossible; and they insist upon it, that it is   
absurd in me to call my slaves ill-treated because, when they act   
grossly wrong, they are treated like English soldiers and sailors.</p>   
<p>All this may be very true; but there is something to me so shooking in the   
idea of this execrable   
cart-whip that I have positively   
forbidden the use of it on Cornwall ; and, if the estate must go to   
rack and ruin without its use, to rack and ruin the estate must   
go. Probably I should care less about this punishment if I had   
not been living among those on whom it may be inflicted ; but   
    
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0082" n="63"/>
   
now, when I am accustomed to see every face that looks upon   
me grinning from ear to ear with pleasure at my notice, and   
hear every voice cry " God bless you, massa! " as I pass, one   
be an absolute brute not to feel unwilling to leave them   
subject to the lash. Besides, they are excellent cajolers. Nicholas   
John Fuller came to me this morning to beg a favour, " and   
beg massa hard, quite hard! " It was, that when massa went   
away he would leave his picture for the negroes, " that they   
might talk to it, all just as they did to massa."

<p>The hospital has been crowded, since my arrival, with patients   
 who have nothing the matter with them. On Wednesday there    
were about thirty invalid ,  of whom only four were cases at all   
 serious ; the rest had " a lilly pain here, massa," or " a bad pain   
 me no know where, massa," and evidently only came to the hospital in   
order to sit idle and chat   
away the time with their    
friends. Four of them the doctor ordered into the field peremptorily: the   
next day there came into   
the sick-house six others;   
upon this I resolved to try my own hand at curing them ; and I    
directed the head-driver to announce that the presents which    
I had brought from England should be distributed to-day, that   
 the new-born children should be christened, and that the negroes   
 might take possession of my house, and amuse themselves till    
twelve at night. The effect of my prescription was magical;   
 two-thirds of the sick were hale and, hearty, at work in the field,    
on Saturday morning, and to-day not a soul remained in the hospital   
except the four serious   
cases.</p>  
   
<p>The christening took place about four o'clock.  Sully's infant,   
which had been destined to perform, part of  this occasion, had   
died in the hospital; but this morning the father came to complain of his   
disappointment, and to   
beg leave to substitute a   
child by  <hi rend="italic"> another  </hi> wife, which, which had been born about two   
months    
before my arrival ; and as the father is a very serviceable fellow,   
and the mother, besides having brought up three children of her   
own, had the additional merit of having reared an infant whose   
own mother had died in child-bed, I broke through the rule of   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0084" n="65"/>
   
only christening those myself who should be born since my   
coming to Jamaica, and granted his request. By good luck, the   
first child to be named was the offspring of Minerva-and Captain; so I told   
the parents that as it   
would be highly proper   
to call the boy after the greatest Captain that the world could   
produce, he should be named Wellington; and that I hoped that,   
he would grow up to serve  <hi rend="italic"> me  </hi> in Jamaica as well as the Duke   
of Wellington had served his massa, the King of England, in   
Europe. The Duke of Sully's child I wanted to call Navarre;   
but the father had brought over a free negro from Savannah la   
Mar to stand godfather, who was his  <hi rend="italic"> fidus Achates, by  </hi> name,   
John Davis; and I found that he had set his heart upon calling the boy John   
Lewis, after his friend   
and myself; so John   
Lewis he was.   
</p>   
<p>There ought to have been a third child, born at seven months,   
whom the  <hi rend="italic"> graundee  </hi> had reared with great difficulty, and dismissed,   
quite strong, from the   
hospital; the mother had taken   
great care of it till the tenth day, when she was entitled to an   
allowance of clothes provisions, &amp;c. ; but no sooner had she   
received her reward than, on that very night, she suffered the   
to remain so long without food, while she went herself to   
dance on a neighbouring estate, that it was brought in an exhausted state   
back to the hospital ;   
and, in spite of every care, it   
expired within four and twenty hours after its return.   
</p>   
<p>The ceremony, was performed with perfect gravity and propriety by   
all parties ; I thought it   
as well to cut the reading part   
it very short; but I  read a couple of prayers, marked the foreheads of the   
children with the sign of   
the cross, and, instead of   
the concluding prayer, I substituted a wish " that God would   
bless the children, and make them live to be as good servants to   
me, as I prayed him to make me a kind massa to them:" upon   
which all present very gravely made me their lowest bows and   
courtesies, and then gave me a loud huzza ; so unusual a mode   
of approbation at a christening that it had nearly overturned my   
seriousness ; and I made haste to serve out Madeira to the pa-rents and assistants, that they might drink the healths of the new    
Christians and of each other. The mothers and the  <hi rend="italic"> graunde </hi>    
were then called up  to the table, and the ladies who were in the   
family-way were arranged behind them.   
</p>  
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0085" n="66"/>
   
<p><hi rend="italic">Their</hi> title in Jamaica is rather coarse, but very expressive.   
I asked Cubina one day " Who was that woman with a basket on   
her head? " " Massa," he answered, "that one belly-woman   
 going to sell provisions at the Bay." As she was going to sell   
  <hi rend="italic"> provisions </hi> , I supposed that  <hi rend="italic"> belly </hi> -woman was the name of   
her   
 trade ; but it afterwards appeared that she was one of those   
females who had given in their names as being in an interesting   
 situation, and who, in consequence, were discharged from al    
severe labour. I then gave the  <hi rend="italic"> graundee </hi>  and the mothers a    
dollar each, and told them that for the future they might claim   
 the same sum, in addition to their usual allowance of clothes and    
provisions, for every infant which should be brought to the overseer alive   
and well on the   
fourteenth day ; and I also gave each    
mother a present of a scarlet girdle with a silver medal in the    
centre, telling her always to wear it on feasts and holidays, when    
it should entitle her to marks of peculiar respect and attention -such as   
being one of those first   
served, and receiving a larger portion than the rest ; that the  <hi rend="italic"> first </hi>    
fault which she might commit   
 should be forgiven on the production of this girdle ; and that   
when she should have any favour to ask, she should always put it   
 round her waist, and be assured that, on seeing it, the overseer    
would allow the wearer to be entitled to particular indulgence.   
 On every additional child, an additional medal is to be affixed to   
 the belt, and precedence is to follow the greater number of medals. I   
expected that this notion of   
an order of honour would    
have been treated as completely fanciful and romantic ; but, to,   
 my great surprise, my manager told me that " he never knew a    
dollar better bestowed than the one which formed the medal of    
the girdle, and that he thought the institution likely to have a    
very good effect."   
</p><p>  
Immediately after the christening the Eboe drums were produced, and, in   
defiance of Sunday, the   
negroes had the irreverence to be gay and happy, while the presents were   
being put in   
order for distribution.  All the men got jackets, the women   
seven yards of stuff each for petticoats, &amp;c., and the children as   
much printed cotton as would make a couple of frocks.  The    
Creoles were delighted beyond measure when some of the African   
male negroes exclaimed, "Tank, massa," and made a low coutesy in the   
estimation of their   
gratitude.  as they were all called   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0086" n="67"/>
   
to receive their presents alphabetically in pairs, some of the   
combinations were very amusing. We had Punch and Plato,    
Priam and Pam, Hemp and Hercules, and Minerva and Moll,    
called together. By twelve they dispersed, and I went to bed,   
 on these occasions, with a violent headache.   
   
</p>   
</div1>  
<div1 type="section" id="d62">  
<head>JANUARY 22. </head>  
  
<p>While I was at dinner a tremendous uproar was heard below   
stairs.  On inquiry, it proved to be Cubina quarrelling with his   
niece Phillis (a good-looking black girl employed about the   
house), about a broken pitcher ; and as her explanation did not   
appear satisfactory to him, he had thought proper to give her a   
few boxes on the ear. Upon hearing this, I read him such a   
lecture on the baseness of a man's striking a woman, and told   
with so much severity that his heart must be a bad one to   
commit such an offence, that poor Cubina, having never heard a   
word from me before, scarcely knew whether he stood   
upon his head or his heels. When he afterwards brought my   
coffee he expressed his sorrow for having offended me, and   
begged my pardon in the most humble manner. I told him, that   
obtain mine he must first obtain that of Phillis; and he immediately   
declared himself ready to   
make her any apology that   
I might dictate. So the girl was called in, and her uncle going   
up to her said, " I am very sorry, Phillis, that I gave way to   
high passion, and called you hard names, and struck you; which   
I ought not to have done while massa was in the house;" (here   
I was going  interrupt him, but he was too clever not to perceive his   
blunder, and made haste to   
add) " nor if lie had  <hi rend="italic"> not </hi>    
been here, nor at all ; so I hope you will have the kindness to   
forgive me this once, and I never will strike you again, and so I   
beg your pardon." And he then put out his hand to her in the   
frank and hearty matter imaginable ; and, on her accepting   
it, made three or four of his very lowest and most graceful   
bows.  I furnished him with a piece of money to give her as a   
peace-offering : they left the room thoroughly reconciled, and   
in five minutes after they and the rest of the servants were all   
chattering, laughing, and singing together, in the most perfect   
harmony and good-humour.  I suppose, if I had desired an upper   
servant in England to make the same submission, he would have   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0087" n="68"/>
   
preferred quitting my service to doing what lie would have   
 called " humbling himself to an inferior;" or, if be bad found   
 himself compelled to give way, he would have been sulky with   
 the girl, and found fault with everything that she did in the    
house for a twelvemonth after.   
</p><p>  
On the other hand, there are some choice ungrateful scoundrels among the   
negroes : on the night   
of their first dance, a                     
couple of sheep disappeared from the pen, although they could    
not have been taken from want of food, as on that very morning    
there had been an ample distribution of fresh beef; and last    
night another sheep and a quantity of poultry followed them.    
Yesterday, too, a young rascal of a boy, called " massa Jackey,"    
who is in the frequent habit of running away for months at a    
time, and whom I had distinguished from the cleverness of his    
countenance and buffoonery of his manners, came to beg my permission   
to go and purchase food   
with some money which I had   
 just given him, " because he was almost starving; his parents    
were dead, be bad no provision-grounds, no allowance, and nobody ever   
gave him anything."   
Upon this I sent Cubina with    
the boy to the storekeeper, when it appeared. that he had always   
 received a regular allowance of provisions twice a week, which   
 he generally sold, as well as his clothes, at the Bay, for spirits;   
 had received an additional portion only last Friday ; and, into    
the bargain, during the whole )of that week bad been fed from    
the house. What he could propose to himself by telling a lie    
which must be so soon detected, I cannot conceive; but I am    
assured that, unless a negro has an interest in telling the truth,    
he always lies-in order to keep his tongue in practice.   
One species of flattery (or of  <hi rend="italic"> Congo-saw,  </hi> as we call it here)    
amused me much this morning: an old woman who is in the    
hospital wanted to express her gratitude for some stewed fish    
which I had sent her for supper, and, instead of calling me    
" massa," she always said-" Tank him, my <hi rend="italic">husband."</hi>    
   
</p>   
</div1>  
<div1 type="section" id="d63">  
<head>JANUARY 24. </head>  
  
<p>This was a day of incessant occupation.  I rose at six o'clock   
and went down to the Bay to settle some business; on   
return I visited the hospital while breakfast was being got ready;   
and as soon as it was over, I went down to the negro-houses to   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0088" n="69"/>
  
hear the whole body of Eboes, lodge a complaint against one of   
 the book-keepers, and to appoint a day for their being heard in   
 his presence. On my return to the house, I found two women    
belonging to a neighbouring estate, who came to complain of    
cruel treatment from their overseer, and to request me to inform    
 their trustee how ill they bad been used, and see their injuries   
redressed. They said, that having been ill in the hospital, and    
ordered to the field while they were still too weak to work, they    
had been flogged with much severity (though not beyond the    
limits of the law) ; and my head driver, who was less scrupulously delicate   
than myself as to   
ocular inspection of Juliet's person-(which Juliet, to do her justice, was   
perfectly ready to submit   
 to in proof of her assertions), told me that the woman bad certainly   
suffered greatly; the other,   
whose name was Delia, was    
but just recovering from a miscarriage, and declared openly that    
the overseer's conduct had been such, that nothing should have    
prevented her running away long ago if she could but have had    
the heart to abandon a child which she bad on the estate. Both    
were poor feeble-looking creatures, and seemed very unfit subjects for any   
severe correction. I   
promised to write to their    
trustee; and, as they were afraid of being punished on their    
return home for having thrown themselves on my protection, I    
wrote a note to the overseer, requesting that the women might    
remain quite unmolested till the trustee's arrival, which was    
daily expected ; and, with this note and a present of cocoa-fingers   
and salt fish, Delia and-Juliet departed, apparently much comforted.   
</p><p>  
They were succeeded by no less a personage than  <hi rend="italic"> Venus  </hi> her-self-a poor little, sickly, timid soul, who had purchased her    
freedom from my father by substituting in her place a fine stout    
wench, who, being Venus's  <hi rend="italic"> locum </hi>   <hi rend="italic"> tenens </hi> , was, by   
courtesy,    
called Venus too, though her right name was "Big Joan;"    
but, by some neglect of the then attorney, Venus had never    
received any title, and she now came to beg " massa so good as    
give paper" otherwise she was still, to all intents and purposes,    
my slave, and I might still have compelled her to work, although,   
at the same time, her substitute was on the estate. Of course I    
promised the paper required, and engaged to act the part of a   
second Vulcan by releasing Venus from my chains : but the   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0089" n="70"/>
   
paper was not the only thing that Venus wanted; she also    
wanted a petticoat! She told me that when the presents were   
distributed on Sunday, the petticoat, which she would otherwise   
 have had, was, of course, " given to the  <hi rend="italic"> other  </hi> Venus;" and    
though, to be sure, she was free now, yet, " when she belonged   
to massa, she had always worked for him well," and " she was    
quite as glad to see massa as the other Venus," and, therefore,    
" ought to have quite as much petticoat." I tried to convince    
her, that for Venus to wear a petticoat of blue durant, or, indeed,   
any petticoat at all, would be quite unclassical : but the goddess of beauty   
stuck to her point, and   
finally carried off the petticoat.   
</p><p>  
Venus had scarcely evacuated the premises when her place    
was occupied by the minister of Savannah la Mar, with proposals for   
instructing the negroes in   
religion ; and the minister,    
in his turn, was replaced by one of the Sunday-night thieves,    
who had been caught while in the actual possession of one of my    
sheep and a great turkey-cock ; and, to make the matter worse,    
he depredator's name was Hercules! The demi-god had nothing    
to say in his excuse: he had just received a large allowance of    
beef :-therefore, hunger had no share in his transgression ; and    
the committing the offence during the very time that I was    
giving the negroes a festival, rendered his ingratitude the more    
flagrant.   
</p><p>  
I perfectly well understood that the man was sent to me by    
my agent, in order to show the absolute necessity of sometimes    
employing the cart-whip, and to see whether I would suffer the    
fellow to escape unpunished. But, as this was the first offender    
who had been brought before me,  I took that for a pretext to    
absolve him: so I lectured him for half an hour with great   
severity, swore that on the very next offence I would order him    
to be sold; and that, if he would not do his fair proportion of   
work without being lashed, he should be sent to work somewhere   
else; for I would suffer no such worthless fellows on my estate   
and would not be at the expense of a cart-whip to correct him.   
Hercules promised most earnestly to behave better in future, and   
was suffered to depart: but I am told that no good can be, expected of him;   
that he is perpetually   
running away; and that   
he had been absent for five weeks together before my arrival   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0090" n="71"/>
   
only returned home upon hearing that there was a distribution of beef,   
rum, and jackets going   
forward; in return for all    
which he stole my sheep and my poor great turkey-cock.

<p>There was a great dinner and ball for the whole county given   
to-day at Montego Bay, to which I was invited ; but I begged   
leave to decline this and all other invitations, being determined   
to give up my whole time to my negroes during my stay in   
Jamaica.   
   
</p>   
</div1>  
<div1 type="section" id="d65">  
<head>JANUARY 26. </head>  
  
<p>Every morning my agent regales me with some fresh instance   
of insubordination : he says nothing plainly, but shakes his head,    
and evidently gives me to understand that the estate cannot be   
governed properly without the cart-whip. It seems that this   
morning the women, one and all, refused to carry away the  <hi rend="italic"> trash </hi>    
(which is one of the easiest tasks that can be set), and that with-out the slightest pretence: in consequence the mill was obliged    
to be stopped ; and when the driver on that station insisted on   
their doing their duty, a little fierce young devil of a Miss    
Whaunica flew at his throat, and endeavoured to strangle him:    
the agent was obliged to be called in, and, at length, this petticoat rebellion   
was subdued, and   
every thing went on as usual   
I have, in consequence, assured the women that, since they will   
not be managed by fair treatment, I must have recourse to other   
measures ; and that, it any similar instance of misconduct should    
take place, I was determined, on my return from Kingston, to   
 sell the most refractory, ship myself immediately for England    
never return to them and Jamaica more. This threat, at the   
time, seemed to produce a great effect; all hands were clasped    
and all voices were raised, imploring me not to leave them, and   
assuring me that in future they would do their work quietly and   
willingly. But  whether the impression will last beyond the immediate   
moment is a point greatly   
to be doubted.   
   
</p>

<div1 type="section" id="d66">

<p>Another morning with the mill stopped, no liquor in the    
boiling-house and no work done. The driver brought the most   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0091" n="72"/>
  
obstinate and insolent of the women to be lectured by me; and   
 I bounced and stormed for half an hour with all my might and    
main, especially at Whaunica. They, at last, appeared to be   
very penitent ashamed a themselves, and engaged never to</p>   
<p>   
behave ill again, if I would but forgive them this present fault   
Whaunica, in particular, assuring me very earnestly, that I   
never should have cause to accuse her of " bad manners " again   
for, in negro dialect, ingratitude is always called " bad manners."   
My agent declares that they never conducted themselves so ill   
before; that they worked cheerfully and properly till my arrival;   
but now they think that I shall protect them against all punishment, and   
have made regularly ten   
hogsheads of sugar a week   
less than they did before my coming upon the estate. This is   
the more provoking, as, by delaying the conclusion of the crop,   
the latter part of it may be driven into the rainy season, and   
then the labour is infinitely more severe both for the slaves and   
the cattle, and more detrimental to their health.   
</p><p>The minister of Savannah la Mar has shown me a plan for the   
religious instruction of the negroes, which was sent to him by    
the ecclesiastical commissaries at Kingston. It consisted but of   
two points: against the first (which recommended the slaves    
being  <hi rend="italic"> ordered  </hi> to go to church on a Sunday) I positively declared    
myself. Sunday is now the absolute property of the negroes   
for their relaxation, as Saturday is for the cultivation of their    
grounds ; and I will not suffer a single hour of it to be taken    
from them for any purpose whatever. If my slaves choose to go    
to church on Sundays, so much the better but not one of them   
shall be  <hi rend="italic"> ordered  </hi> to do one earthly thing on Sundays, but that    
which be chooses himself. The second article recommended    
occasional pastoral visits of the minister to the different estates;   
 and in this respect I promised to give him every facility-although    
I greatly doubt any good effect being produced by a few short   
 visits, at considerable intervals, on the minds of ignorant creatures, to   
whom no palpable and   
immediate benefit is offered. It    
appears, indeed, to me, that the only means of giving the negroes   
 morality and religion must be through the medium of education,    
and their being induced to read such books in the minister's    
absence as may recall to their thoughts what they have heard   
 from him; otherwise, he may talk for an hour, and they will   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0092" n="73"/>
   
have understood but little-and remember nothing. There is   
not a single negro among my whole three hundred who can read   
a line ; and what I suppose to be wanted on West Indian estates   
is not an importation of missionaries, but of schoolmasters on   
Dr. Bell's plan, if it could by any means be introduced here    
with effect. However, in the meanwhile I told the minister that    
I was perfectly well inclined to have every measure tried that   
might enlighten the minds of the negroes, provided it did not   
interfere with their own hours of leisure, and were not compulsory.  I   
mentioned, to him a plan   
for commencing his instructions under the most favourable auspices, of    
which he seemed to   
approve ; during my absence, which may do good and can do no    
harm ; and, even should it fail to make the negroes religious,    
will, at least, add another humane inspector to my list.

I shall have enough to do in Jamiaca if I accepted   
all the offices   
that are pressed upon me.  A large body of negroes from a   
neighbouring estate came over to Cornwall this morning to complain of   
hard treatment, various   
ways, from the overseer and   
drivers, and to request me to represent their injuries to their    
trustee here, and their proprietor in England.  the charges were   
so strong, that I am certain that they must be fictious ; however, I listened   
to their story with   
patience ; promised that the   
trustee(whom I was to see in a few days) should know their   
complaint, and they went away apparently satisfied.  then   
came a runaway negro who wanted to return home, and requested   
me to write a few lines to his master, to save him from the lash.   
He was succeeded by a poor creature named Bessie, who, although still a   
young woman, is   
exempt from labour, on account   
of her being afflicted with the  <hi rend="italic"> cocoa-bay </hi> , one of the most horrible   
of negro diseases.  it shows   
itself in large blotches   
and swellings, which generally moulder away, by degrees, the   
joints of the toes and fingers, till they rot and drop off ; sometimes as   
much as half a foot will go   
at once.  As the disease is    
communicable by contact, the person so afflicted is necessarily   
shunned by society ; and this poor woman, who is married to   
John Fuller, one of the best young men on the estate, and by   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0093" n="74"/>
   
whom she has had four children (although they'are all dead),   
 has for some time been obliged to live separated from him, lest   
 he should be destroyed by contracting the same complaint. She    
now came to tell me that she wanted a blanket, " for that the    
cold killed her of nights," cold being that which negroes dislike    
most, and from which most of their illnesses arise. Of course    
she got her blanket ; then she said that she wanted medicine for    
her complaint. " Had not the doctor seen her ? " " Oh, yes!    
Dr. Goodwin; but the white doctor could do her no good. She    
wanted to go to a black doctor, named Ormond, who belonged   
 to a neighbouring gentleman." I told her that if this black    
doctor understood her particular disease better than others, certainly she   
should go to him ; but   
that if he pretended to cure    
her by charms or spells, or anything but medicine, I should desire his   
master to cure the black   
doctor by giving him the punishment proper for such an impostor. Upon   
this Bessie burst into    
tears, and said " That Ormond was not an Obeah man, and that    
she had suffered too much by Obeah men to wish to have any    
more to do with them. She had made Adam her enemy by betraying him,   
when he had attempted   
to poison the former attorney; he had then cursed her, and wished that she   
might never   
 be hearty again; and from that very time her complaint had,   
 declared itself, and her poor pickaninies had all died away one   
 after another; and she was sure that it was Adam who had done    
all this mischief by Obeah." Upon this I put myself in a great   
rage, and asked her " how she could believe that God would   
suffer a low wicked fellow like Adam to make good people die,   
merely because he wished them dead.  </p>   
<p>She did not know ;   
she knew nothing about God ; had never heard of any such</p>   
<p>.</p>   
<p>   
Being, nor of any other world." I told her that God was a</p><p>   
great personage, " who lived up yonder above the blue, in a   
place full of pleasures and free from pains, where Adam and   
wicked people could not come; that her pickaninies were not   
dead for ever, but were only gone up to live with God, who was   
good, and would take care of them for her; and that if she were   
good, when she died she too would go up to God above the blue,   
and see all her four pickaninies again." The idea seemed so   
new and so agreeable to the poor creature, that she clapped her   
hands together  and began laughing for joy; so I said to her   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0094" n="75"/>
   
everything that I could imagine likely to remove her prejudice :    
 told her that I should make it a crime even so much as to mention the   
word Obeah on the estate;   
and that if any negro from    
that time forward should be proved to have accused another of    
Obeahing him, or of telling another that he had been Obeahed,    
he should forfeit his share of the next present of salt fish which    
I meant soon to distribute among the slaves, and should never    
receive any favour from me in future ; so I gave Bessie a piece   
money, and she seemed to go away in better spirits than she   
came.  
</p><p>  
This Adam of whom she complained is a most dangerous fellow; he has   
been long suspected of   
being connected with Obeah   
men , and is the terror of all his companions with whom he lives   
in a constant state of warfare. He is a creole, born on my own   
property and has several sisters, who have obtained their freedom, and are   
in every respect   
creditable and praiseworthy ; and   
to one of them I consider myself particularly indebted, as    
she was the means of saving poor Richard's life when the tyranny of the   
overseer had brought   
him almost to the brink of   
the grave. But this brother is in everything the very reverse   
of his sisters. There is no doubt of his having (as Bessie stated)   
infused poison into the water-jars through spite against the late   
superintendent.  I t was in this fellow's hut that the old Obeah   
man was found concealed, whom my attorney seized and transported last   
year.  he is,   
unfortunately, clever and plausible ;    
and I am told that the mischief which he has already done, by   
working upon the folly and superstition of his fellows, is incalculable ; yet   
I cannot get  rid of   
him; the law will not suffer    
any negro to be shipped off the island until he shall have been   
convicted of felony at the sessions.  I cannot sell him, for nobody would   
buy him, nor except hi,   
if  I would offer them   
so dangerous a present.  If he were to go away the law would   
seize him and bring him back to me, and I should be obliged to   
pay heavily for his re-taking and his maintenance in the workhouse.  In   
short, I know not what I   
can do with him.   
</p><p>  
There are certainly many excellent qualities in the negro character ; their   
worst faults appear to   
be this prejudice respecting   
obeah, and the facility with which they are frequently induced   
to poison to the right hand and to the left.  A neighbouring   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0095" n="76"/>
   
gentleman, as, I hear, has now three negroes in prison (all domestics, and   
one of them grown grey in his service) for poisoning   
 him with corrosive sublimate; his brother was actually killed by    
similar means; yet I am assured that both of them were reckoned men of   
great humanity. Another   
agent, who appears   
to be in high favour with the negroes whom he now governs,      
was obliged to quit an estate, from the frequent attempts to   
poison him; and a person against whom there is no sort of    
charge alleged for tyranny, after being brought to the doors of   
 death by a cup of coffee, only escaped a second time by his    
civility in giving the beverage prepared for himself to two young    
book-keepers, to both of whom it proved fatal. It indeed came out    
afterwards, that this crime was also effected by the abominable belief in   
Obeah: the woman who   
mixed the draught bad    
no idea of its being poison ; but she had received the deleterious   
ingredients from an Obeah man, as " a charm to make her massa    
good to her:" by which the negroes mean, the compelling a    
person to give another everything for which that other may ask    
him.   
</p><p>  
Next to this vile trick of poisoning people (arising, doubtless,   
 in a great measure from their total want of religion and their   
 ignorance of a future state, which makes them dread no punishment   
hereafter for themselves,   
and look with but little respect on   
 human life in others), the greatest drawback upon one's comfort    
in a Jamaica existence seems to me to be the being obliged to    
live perpetually in public. Certainly, if a man was desirous of    
leading a life of vice  <hi rend="italic"> here,  </hi> be must have set himself totally above    
shame, for be may depend upon everything done by him being    
seen and known. The houses are absolutely transparent -the    
walls are nothing but windows, and all the doors stand wide,    
open. No servants are in waiting to announce arrivals: visitors, negroes,   
dogs, cats, poultry, all   
walk in and out, and up    
and down your rooms, without the slightest ceremony.

I find that Bessie's black doctor is really nothing more than a    
professor of medicine as to this particular disease ; and I have   
ordered her to be sent to him in the mountains immediately.  
</p><p>  
Several gentlemen of the of the country dined with me to-day.  We   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0096" n="77"/>
   
had at dinner a land-tortoise and a barbecued pig, two of the   
best and richest dishes that I ever tasted, the latter, in particular, it was   
dressed in the true maroon   
fashion, being placed   
on a barbecue (a frame of wicker-work, through whose interstices  the   
steam can ascend), filled   
with peppers and spices of the   
highest flavour, wrapped in plantain leaves, and then buried in    
a hole filled with hot stones, by whose vapour it is baked, no    
particle of the juice being thus suffered to evaporate. I have    
eaten several other good Jamaica dishes, but none so excellent    
as this, a large portion of which was transferred to the most infirm patients   
in the hospital.   
Perhaps an English physician    
would have felt every hair of his wig bristle upon his head with    
astonishment at bearing me this morning ask a woman in a fever,    
bow her bark and her barbecued pig had agreed with her. But    
with negroes, I find that feeding the sick upon stewed fish and    
pork, highly seasoned, produces the very best effects possible.   
</p><p>  
Some of the fruits here are excellent, such as shaddocks,    
oranges, granadilloes, forbidden fruit ; and one between an    
orange and a lemon, called 11 the grape or cluster-fruit," appears    
to me quite delicious. For the vegetables I cannot say so much:   
yams, plantains, cocoa-poyers, yam-poys, bananas, &amp;c., look and    
taste all so much alike, that I scarcely know one from the other:    
they are all something between bread and potatoes, not so good    
as either, and I am quite tired of them all. The Lima bean is    
aid to be more like a pea than a bean ; but whatever it be like,    
it appeared to me very indifferent. As to the peas themselves,    
nothing can be worse. The achie fruit is a kind of vegetable,    
which generally is fried in butter; many people, I am told, are    
food of it, but I could find no merit in it. The palm-tree (or    
abba, as it is called here) produces a long scarlet or reddish    
brown cone, which separates into beads, each of which contains    
a roasting-nut surrounded by a kind of stringy husk, which being    
boiled in salt and water, upon being chewed has a taste of artichoke, but   
the consistence is very   
disagreeable. The only native   
vegetable which I like much is the ochra, which tastes like asparagus not   
with quite so delicate a   
flavour.   
</p><p>fish, the variety is endless; but I think it rather consists    
of names than of flavour. From this, however, I    
must except the silk-fish and mud-fish, and above all, the    
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0097" n="78"/>
</p><p>   
   
mountain-mullet, which is almost the best fish I ever tasted. All the    
shell-fish that I have met with as yet have been excellent; oysters have not   
come in my way, but I   
am told that they are not    
only poor and insipid, but frequently are so poisonous that I had    
better not venture upon them ; and so ends this chapter of the     
"Almanach des Gourmands" for Jamaica.

<p>There were above twenty ladies literally at my feet this morning. I   
went down to the   
negro-village to speak to Bessie about   
going to her black doctor; and all the refractory females of last   
week, hearing of my being there, came in a body to promise   
better conduct for the future, and implore Me not to go away.   
</p>   
<p>The sight of my carriage getting ready to take me to Kingston,   
and the arrival of post-horses, bad alarmed them with the idea   
that I was really going to put into execution my threats of leaving them for   
ever. They had   
artfully enough prevailed on the   
wife of Clifford (the driver whom Whaunica bad collared) to be   
their spokeswoman ; and they begged, and lifted up their folded   
bands, and cried, and fell on the ground, and kissed my feet   
and, in short, acted their part so well, that they almost made me   
act mine to perfection, and fall to blubbering. I told them that   
I certainly should go to Kingston on Thursday; but if I had   
good accounts of them during my , absence, I should return in a   
few days; if, on the contrary, the idle negroes continued to refuse to work   
without compulsion,   
then, in justice to the good   
ones (who last week were obliged to do more than their share),   
those punishments which I bad stopped must be resumed; but   
that as Cornwall would be insupportable to me if I could not   
live there without hearing the crack of the abominable cart-whip,   
all (lay long, I would not return to it, but ship myself off for   
England, and never visit them or Jamaica any more. And then   
I talked very sternly and positively about " punishments,". and   
making-bad negroes do their work properly ;" and every third,   
word was tile cart-whip, till I almost 'fancied myself the princess'   
in the " Fairy Tale," who never opened her month but out came..   
two toads and three couple of serpents. However, to sweeten,   
my oration a little at the end, I told them that, " having inquired   
closely into the characters of the present book-keepers, I had   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0098" n="79"/>
   
found no charge against any of them except one, who was accused   
of having occasionally struck a negro, of using bad language to   
them, and of being a hasty passionate man, though in other   
respects very serviceable to the estate. But although these faults   
were but trifling, and some of them not proved, so determined   
was I to show that I would suffer no white person on the estate   
who maltreated the negroes either by word or deed, that I had   
determined to make an example of him for the warning of the   
rest, and accordingly had dismissed him this morning."   
  
</p><p> This book-keeper, by his own account, bad made himself obnoxious to   
them, and on hearing   
of his discharge they one and   
all sprawled upon the ground  in a rapture  of joy and gratitude.   
</p><p>The man had denied positively the charge of striking the negroes, and   
ascribed in cutting out   
part of a boiling-house window,   
in order that he might  pass out atolen sugar unperceived -for, to   
do the negroes justice, it is a doubt whether they are the greatest   
thieves or liars, and the quantity of sugar which they purloin   
during the crop, and dispose of at the Bay for a mere trifle, is   
enormous.  However, whether the charge of strinking was true   
or not, it was sufficiently proved that this book-keeper was a   
passionate man, and he himself "that the negroes had conceived a spite   
against him.  Indeed, I   
had less unwillingness to do   
this, because from the slight nature of this offence it will be easy   
for him to find another situation ; and I have besides desired   
a double salary on going away, which will free him from any   
charge of having been dismissed disgracefully.

<p>I left Cornwall for Spanish Town at six in the morning, accompanies by   
a young naval officer,   
the son of my next neighbour, Mr. Hill, of Amity, who was good enough   
not only to   
lend me a kitteren with a canopy to perform my journey in,   
to send his son to be my  <hi rend="italic"> cicerone </hi>  on my tour.  The road wound   
through mountain-passes, or else on a shelf of rock so narrow&mdash;   
though without the slightest danger&mdash;that one of the wheels was   
frequently in the sea, while the other side was fenced by a line   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0099" n="80"/>
   
of bold broken cliff, clothed with trees completely from their   
brows down to the very edge of the water.  Between eight and    
nine we reached a solitary tavern called Blue-fields, where the   
horses rested for a couple of hours.  It had a very pretty garden   
on the sea-shore, which contained a picturesque cottage, exactly   
resembling an ornamental hermitage ; and leaning against one    
of the pillars of its porch we found a young girl, who exactly   
answered George Coleman's description of Yarico, "quite brown,   
but extremely genteel, like a Wedgewood teapot."  She told us   
that she was a Spanish creole who had fled with her mother from   
the disputes between the royalists and independents in the island   
of Old Providence ; and the owner of the tavern being a relation   
of her mother, he had permitted them to establish themselves in   
his garden-cottage till the troubles of their own country should be   
over.  She talked perfectly good English, and said that there were   
many of that nation established in Providence.  Her name was   
Antoinetta.  Her figure was light and elegant ; her black eyes   
mild and bright ; her countenance intelligent and good-humoured ;   
and her teeth beautiful to perfection ; altogether, Antoinetta   
was by far the handsomest creole that I have ever seen.   
</p>   
<p>From Blue-fields we proceedeed at once to Lakovia ( a small   
village), a stage of thirty miles.  Here we found a realy of   
horses, which conveyed us by seven o'clock to " the Gutturs,"   
a house belonging to the proprietor of the post-horses, and   
situated at the very foot of the tremendous May-day Mountains.  the house   
is an excellent one,   
and we found good beds,   
eatables, and, in short, everything that travellers could wish.   
The distance from lakovia to " the Gutturs" is sixteen miles.

Yesterday the only very striking point of view ( although the   
whole of the raod was piccturesque0 was "the Cove," situated   
between the Blue-fileds and Lakovia ; but our journey to-day was a   
succession of beautiful scenes from  beginning to end.  Instantly   
on leaving "the Gutturs" we began to ascend the May-daay   
mountains, and it was not till after travelling for five and twenty   
miles that we found ourselves at the foot of them on the other    
side, at a place called Williamsfield.  To be sure, the road was    
so rough that it was enough to make one envy the Mahometan   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0100" n="81"/>
   
women, who having no souls at all, could not possibly have   
them jolted out of their bodies; but the beauty of the scenery   
amply rewarded us for our bruised sides and battered backs.   
The road was for the most part bounded by lofty rocks on one    
side, and a deep precipice on the other, and bordered with a profusion of   
noble trees and   
flowering shrubs in great variety. In   
particular, I was struck with the picturesque appearance of some    
wild fig trees of singular size and beauty. Although there were    
only two of us besides servants, we found it necessary to employ    
seven horses and a couple of mules; and as our cavalcade wound    
along through the mountains the Spanish look of our sumpter mules and of   
our kittereens (which   
are precisely the vehicle in    
which Gil Blas is always represented when travelling with Scipio    
towards Lirias) gave us quite the appearance of a caravan; nor    
should I have been greatly surprised to see a trap-door open in   
the middle of the road, and Captain Rolando's whiskers make   
appearance. Every one spoke to me with contempt of this   
south road in respect of beauty, when compared with the northen ;   
however, it certainly seemed to me more beautiful than any road   
 which I had ever travelled.

<p>  A stage of twenty miles brought us to Old Harbour, and,   
passing through the Dry River, twelve more landed us at Spanish Town,    
otherwise called St. Jago de la Vega, and the seat of   
government in Jamaica, , although Kingston is much larger and   
more populous, and must be considered as the principal town.   
We found very clean and comfortable lodgings at Miss Cole's.   
Spanish Town has nothing to recommend it: the houses are   
mostly built of wood ; the streets are very irregular and narrow ;   
every alternate building is in a ruinous state, and the whole place   
wears an air of gloom and melancholy. The Government House   
is a large clumsy-looking brick building with a portico, the   
stucco of which has suffered by the weather, and it can advance   
no pretensions to architectural beauty. On one side of the square   
in which it stands there is a small temple protecting a statue of   
Lord Rodney, executed by Bacon : some of the bas-reliefs on the   
pedestal appeared to me very good ; but the old admiral is most   
absurdly dressed in the habit of a Roman general, and furbished   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0101" n="82"/>
   
out with buskins and a truncheon. The temple itself is quite in    
opposition to good taste, with very low arches, surmounted by   
 heavy bas-reliefs out of all proportion.

We breakfasted with the chief justice, who is my relation,    
and of my own name, and then went to the church, which is a    
very handsome one; the walls lined with fine mahogany, and    
ornamented with many monuments of white marble, in memory    
of the former governors and other principal inhabitants. It    
seems that my ancestors on both sides have always had a taste    
for being well lodged after their decease; for on admiring one    
of these tombs, it proved to be that of my maternal grandfather;    
but still this was not to be compared for a moment with my    
mausoleum at Cornwall. After church I went home with the    
rector, who is one of the ecclesiastical commissaries, and had a    
long conversation with him respecting a plan which is in agitation for   
giving the negroes   
something of a religious education.    
We afterwards dined with the member for Westmoreland; and    
as everybody in Jamaica is on foot by six in the morning, at ten    
in the evening we were quite ready to go to bed.

The chief justice went with me to Kingston, where I  had appointed the   
agent for my other estate   
in St. Thomas's-in-the-East    
to meet me. The short time allotted for my stay in the island    
makes it impossible to attend properly both to this estate and to    
Cornwall at this first visit, and therefore I determined to confine   
my attention to the negroes on the latter estate till my return to    
Jamaica. I now contented myself by impressing on the mind   
my agent (who I am certain is a most humane and intelligent    
man), my extreme anxiety for the abolition of the cart-whip;    
and I had the satisfaction of hearing from him, that for a long    
time it had never been used, more than perhaps twice in the year   
and then only very slightly, and for, some offence so flaggrant   
that it was impossible tp pass over it ; and he assured me that   
whenever I visit Hordley I may depend upon its not being employed at all.    
on the other hand, I   
am told that a gentleman   
of the parish of Vere, who came over to Jamaica for the sole   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0102" n="83"/>
   
purpose of ameliorating the condition of his negroes, after abolishing the   
cart.-whip, has at length   
been constrained to resume   
 occasional use of it because he found it utterly impossible    
to keep them in any sort of subordination without it.   
</p><p>There is not here that air of melancholy which pervades Spanish Town,   
but the place has no   
pretensions to beauty; and if any   
person will imagine a large town entirely composed of booths at   
a race-course, and the streets merely roads, without any sort of    
paving, he will have a perfect idea of Kingston.

The Jamaica canoes are hollowed cotton-trees. We embarked   
in one of them at six in the morning, and visited the ruins of    
Port Royal, which, last year, was destroyed by fire.  Some of   
the houses were rebuilding ; but it was a melancholy sight, not   
only from the look of the half-burnt buildings, but the dejected   
countenances of the ruined inhabitants.  I returned to breakfast   
 with the rector and two other ecclesiastical commissaries ; had   
more conversation about their proposed plan, and became still   
more convinced of the difficulty of doing anything effectual   
without danger to the island and to the negroes themselves, and   
of the extreme delicacy requisite in whatever may be attempted.   
We afterwards visited the school of the children of the poor, who   
are educating upon Dr. Bell's system; and then saw the church,   
a very large and handsome one on the inside, but mean enough   
as to its exterior. I was shown the tombstone of Admiral Ben   
bow, who was killed in a naval engagement, and whose ship   
afterwards  
   
<q><lg><l>"Bore down to Port Royal, where the people flocked very much </l>  
<l>To see brave Admiral Benbow laid in Kingston Town Church,"</l></lg></q>  
   
admiral's Homer informs us.    
  
</p><p>  
The church is a large one, but it is going to be still further   
extended ; the negroes in Kingston and its neighbourhood being   
(as the rector assured me) so anxious to obtain religious instruction, that   
on Sundays not only the   
church but the churchyard   
that it is so completely thronged with them as to make it difficult to   
traverse the crowd ; and those who are fortunate enough to obtain seats for   
the morning service   
never stir out of the church   
during the whole day, through fear of being excluded from that   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0103" n="84"/>
   
of the evening. They also flock to be baptized in great numbers, and many   
have lately come to be   
married; and their    
burials and christenings are performed with great pomp and    
solemnity.   
</p><p>  
One of the most intelligent of the negroes with whom I have         
     
yet conversed, was the coxswain of my Port Royal canoe. I asked    
him whether he had been christened? He answered, no; be    
did not yet think himself good enough, but he hoped to be so in    
time.  Nor was he married; for he was still young, and afraid    
that he could not break off his bad habits, and be contented to    
live with no other woman than his wife; and so he thought it    
better not to become a Christian till he could feel certain of performing the   
duties of one.   
However, he said, he had at least    
cured himself of one bad custom, and never worked upon Sundays, except   
on some very urgent   
necessity. I asked what he    
did on Sundays, instead: did he go to church ?-No. Or employ    
himself in learning to read ?-Oh, no : though he thought being   
able to read  <hi rend="italic"> was a great virtue  </hi> (which was his constant expression   
for anything right, pleasant, or   
profitable) ; but he had no    
leisure to learn on week-days; and, as he had heard the parson    
say that Sunday ought to be a day of rest, he made a point of    
doing nothing at all on that day. He praised his former master,   
of whose son he was now the property ; and said that neither of    
them had ever occasion to lay a finger on him. He worked as    
a waterman, and paid his master ten shillings a-week, the rest    
of his earnings being his own profits; and when he owed wages    
for three months, if he brought two his master would always give    
him time for the remainder, and that in so kind a manner that he    
always fretted himself to think that so kind a master should wait    
for his rights, and worked twice as hard till the debt was discharged. He   
said that kindness was   
the only way to make good    
negroes ; and that, if  <hi rend="italic"> that  </hi> failed, flogging would never succeed :    
and  he advised me, when I found a negro worthless, " to sell    
him at once, and not stay to flog him, and so, by spoiling his    
appearance, make him sell for less ; for blacks must not be   
treated now, massa, as they used to be ; they can think, and hear,   
and see, as well as white people : blacks are wiser, massa, than   
they were, and will soon be still wiser,"  I thought the fellow   
himself was a good proof of is assertion.

<p>I left Kingston at two o'clock, in defiance of a broiling sun;    
reached Spanish Town in time to dine with the Attorney-General,    
and went afterwards to the play, where I found my acquaintance    
Mr. Hill, of Covent Garden Theatre.  The theatre is neat    
enough; as to the performance, it was about equal to any provincial   
theatricals that I ever saw in   
England although the    
pieces represented were by no means well selected, being entirely    
musical , and the orchestra consisting of nothing more than a    
couple of fiddles.

<p>We were to return by the North. Road, and set out at six in    
the morning. The first stage was to the West Tavern, nineteen    
miles; and nothing can be imagined more sublime or more    
beautiful than the scenery. Our road lay along the banks of the    
Rio Cobre, which runs up to Spanish Town, where its floods    
frequently commit dreadful ravages. Large masses of rock intercept its   
current at small intervals,   
which, as well as its shallowness, render it unnavigable. The cliffs and   
trees are of the    
most gigantic size; and the road goes so near the brink of a    
tremendous precipice that we were obliged always to send a servant   
forwards to warn any other   
carriage of our approach, in   
that it might stay in some broader part while we passed it.    
A bridge had been attempted to be built over the river, but a    
storm demolished it before its completion, and nothing was now    
left standing but a single enormous arch. In like manner, the    
" Dry River " sets all bridges at defiance: when we crossed it,    
between Old Harbour and Spanish Town, it was nothing but a    
waste of sand; but its floods frequently pour down with irresistible   
strength and rapidity, and   
sometimes render it impassable    
for weeks together. I was extremely delighted with the first ten    
miles of  this stage: unluckily, a mist then arose, so thick that it    
was utterly impossible even to guess at the surrounding scenery,    
and the morning was so cold that I was very glad to wrap myself in my   
cloak as closely as if I   
had been travelling in an   
English December.   
</p><p> By the time of our leaving the West Tavern the mist had dispersed, and   
I was able to admire   
the extraordinary beauty of   
Mount Diavolo, which we were then crossing. Though we had   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0105" n="86"/>
   
left the river, the road was still a narrow shelf of rock running    
along the edge of ravines of great depth, and filled with broken    
masses of stone and trees of wonderful magnitude. At intervals we   
emerged for a time into places   
resembling ornamental    
parks in England, the lawns being of the liveliest verdure, the   
ground rising and falling in an endless variety, and enriched with    
a profusion of trees, majestic in stature and picturesque in their    
shapes, many of them entirely covered with the beautiful flowers    
of " hogsmeat," and other creeping plants. The logwood, too,    
is now perfectly golden with its full bloom, and perfumes all , the   
 air; and nothing can be more gay than the quantity of wild   
 flowers which catch the eye on all sides, particularly the wild    
pine and the wild ipecacuanha. We travelled for sixteen miles,    
which brought us to our harbour for the night-a solitary tavern,    
called Blackheath, situated in the heart of the mountains of St.    
Anne.   
   
</p>   
</div1>  
<div1 type="section" id="d77">

<p>The road soon brought us down to the very brink of the sea,    
which we continued to skirt during the whole of the stage; and    
then to St. Anne's Bay, where we found an excellent breakfast    
at an inn, quite in the English fashion, for the landlady had    
been long resident in Great Britain. Everything was clean and    
comfortable, and the windows looked full upon the sea. Our    
road still lay by the sea-side till we began to ascend the mountain of Rio   
Bueno; from which we   
at length perceived the river    
itself running into the sea. It was at Porto Bueno that Columbus    
is said to have made his first landing on the island. Rio Bueno    
is a small town, with a fort, situated close to the sea. Here also    
we found a very good inn, kept by a Scotchman.   
</p><p>The landlady was a pretty brown girl, by name Eliza Thompson. She told   
me that she was only   
residing with her parents    
during her  <hi rend="italic"> husband's </hi>  absence; for she was (it seems) the   
 <hi rend="italic"> soidisant  </hi> wife of an English merchant in   
Kingston, and had a house   
on Tachy's Bridge.  This kind of establishment is the highest   
object of the  <hi rend="italic"> brown </hi>  females in Jamaica ; they seldom marry men   
of their own colour, but lay themselves out to captivate some   
white person, who takes them for mistresses, under the appellation of   
housekeepers.   
</p>  
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0106" n="87"/>
   
<p>Soon afterwards after my arrival at Cornwall, I asked my attorney   
whether   
a clever-looking brown woman, who seemed to have great authority in the   
house, belonged to   
me? &mdash; No ; she was a free woman.   
Was she in my service, then?&mdash;No ; she was not in my service.   
I began to grow impatient.&mdash;" But what  <hi rend="italic"> does </hi>  she do at Cornwall?   
of what use is she in the house?"&mdash;"Why, sir, as to use..... 
of no great use , sir:"  and then after a pause, he added in a   
lower voice, "It is custom, sir, in this country for unmarried   
men to have housekeepers, and Nancy is mine."  But he was   
unjust in saying that Nancy is of no use on the estate ; for she is   
perpetually in the hospital, nurses the children, can bleed and    
mix medicines, and (as I am assured) is of more service to   
the sick than all the doctors.  These brown housekeepers generally attach   
themselves sincerely to   
the interests of their protectors, and make themselves so useful, that they   
commonly   
retain their situation ; and their children (if slaves) are always   
honoured by their fellows with the title Miss.  My mulatto   
housemaid is always called "Miss Polly" by her fellow-servant   
Phillis.  This kind of connexion os considered by a brown girl   
in the same light as marriage.  She will tell you, with an air of   
vanity,  "I am Mr. Such-a-one's  <hi rend="italic"> Love </hi> !" and always speaks of   
him as being her  <hi rend="italic"> husband </hi>  : and I am told that, except on these   
terms, it is extremely difficult to obtain the favours of a woman   
of colour.

<p>A  stage of eighteen miles brought us to the town of Falmouth,   
which I understand to be in size the second of the island.   
</p>  
<p>We proceeded, for twenty-two miles, to Montego Bay, where   
I once more found myself under the protecting roof of Miss Judy   
James.   
</p><p> On our return from dinner at Mr. Dewer's we discovered a    
ball of brown ladies and gentlemen opposite them.  No   
whites nor blacks were permitted to attend this assembly ; but,   
as out landlady had two nieces there, under her auspices we were   
allowed to be spectators.  The females chiefly consisted of  the   
natural daughters of attorneys and overseers, and the young men   
were mostly clerks and book-keepers.  I saw nothing at all to   
be compared, either for form or feature, to many of the humbler   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0107" n="88"/>
   
people of colour, much less to the beautiful Spaniard at Blue-fields.    
Long, or Bryan Edwards, asserts that mulattoes never breed    
except with a black or white; but at this ball two girls were    
pointed out to me, the daughters of mulatto parents; and I have    
been assured that the assertion was a mistake, arising from such a   
connexion being very rarely formed; the females generally prefer ring to   
live with white men,   
and the brown men having thus no    
other resource than black women. As to the above girls, the fact    
is certain ; and the different shades of colour are distinguished by    
too plain a line to allow any suspicion of infidelity on the part    
of their parents.

I reached Cornwall about three o'clock, after an excursion    
the most amusing and agreeable that I ever made in my life.    
Almost every step of the road presented some new and striking    
scene; and although we travelled at all hours, and with as little    
circumspection as if we bad been in England, I never felt a    
headache except for one half-hour. On my arrival, I found the    
satisfactory intelligence usually communicated to West Indian   
proprietors. My estate in the west is burnt up for want of    
moisture ; and my estate in the east has been so completely    
flooded, that I have lost a third of my crop. At Cornwall not    
a drop of rain has fallen since the l6th of November. Not a    
vestige of verdure is to be seen; and we begin to apprehend a    
famine among the negroes in consequence of the drought destroying their   
provision-grounds.   
This alone is wanting to complete the dangerous state of the island; where   
the higher classes    
are all in the utmost alarm at rumours of Wilberforce's intentions,    
to set the negroes entirely free; the next step to which would    
be, in all probability, a general massacre of the whites, and a,   
second edition of the bor rs of St Domingo : while, on the    
other hand, the negroes are impatient at the delay ; and such disturbances   
arose in St. Thomas's-in the-East, last Christmas, as    
required the interposition of the magistrates.  They say that the   
negroes of that parish had taken it into their heads that  <hi rend="italic"> the  </hi>    
 <hi rend="italic"> regent and Wilberforce </hi>  had actually determined upon setting   
them all at liberty at once on the first day of the present year,   
but that the interference of the island had defeated the plan.   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0108" n="89"/>
   
Their discontent was most carefully and artfully fomented by   
some brown Methodists, who held secret and nightly meetings   
on the different estates, and did their best to mislead and bewilder these   
poor creatures with their   
fantastic and absurd   
preaching.  These fellows harp upon sin, and the devil, and hellfire   
incessantly, and describe the   
Almighty ans the Saviour as    
being so terrible, that many of their proselytes cannot hear the   
name of Christ without shuddering.  ne poor negro, on one of    
my own estates, told the overseer that he knew himself to be so   
great a sinner that nothing could save him from the Devil's   
clutches, even for a few hours, except singing hymns ; and he   
kept singing so incessantly day and night, that at length terror   
and want of sleep turned his brain, and the poor wretch dies   
raving mad.

<p> A Sir Charles price, who had an estate in this island infested   
by rats, imported, with much trouble, a very large and strong   
species for the purpose of extirpating the others.  the newcomers answered   
his purpose to a   
miracle ; they attacked the   
native rats with such spirit, that in a short time they had the   
whole property to themselves ; but no sooner had they done   
their duty upon the rats, than they extended their exertions to   
the cats, of whom their strength and size at length enabled them   
completely to get the better ; and since that last victory, Sir   
Charles Price's rats, as they are called, have since increased so   
prodigiously, that this single   
species is now a greater nuisance to   
the island than all the others before them were together.  The   
best mode of destroying rats here is with terrier.  Those imported from   
England soon grow   
useless, being blinded by the   
sun ; but their puppoes, born in Jamaica, are provided by nature   
with a protecting film over their eyes, which effectually secures   
them against that calamity.

Poor Philippa, the woman who used to always to call me her   
"husband," and whom I  left sick in the hospital, during my   
absences has gone out of her senses ; and there cannot well happen   
anything more distressing, as   
there is no separate place for   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0109" n="90"/>
</p><p>   
   
her confinement, and her ravings disturb the other invalids.    
There is, indeed, no kind of bedlam in the whole island of  Jamaica:   
whether this proceeds from   
people being so very sedate    
and sensible, that they never go mad, or from their all being so   
mad, that no one person has a right to shut up another for being    
out of his senses, is a point which I will not pretend to decide.    
One of my domestic negroes, a boy of sixteen, named Prince   
 was abandoned by his worthless mother in infancy, and reared    
by this Philippa; and since her illness he passes every moment    
of his leisure in her sick-room. On the other hand, there is a    
woman named Christian, attending two fevered children in the    
hospital; one her own, and the other an adopted infant, whom    
she reared upon the death of its mother in child-birth ; and    
there she sits, throwing her eyes from one to the other with such    
unceasing solicitude, that no one could discover which was her    
own child and which the orphan.

<p>Two Jamaica nightingales have established themselves on the    
orange-tree  which grows against my window, and their song is    
most beautiful. This bird is also called ' the mocking-bird,"    
from its facility of imitating, not only the notes of every other    
animal, but&mdash;I am told&mdash;of catching every tune that may be    
played or sung two or three times in the house near which it resides, after   
which it will go   
through the air with the greatest    
taste and precision, throwing in cadences and ornaments that    
Catalani herself might envy.   
</p><p>  
But by far the most curious animal that I have yet seen in    
Jamaica is " the soldier," a species of crab, which inhabits a   
shell like a snail's, so small in proportion to its limbs, that    
nothing can be more curious or admirable than the machinery    
by which it is enabled to fold them up instantly on the slightest   
alarm.  They inhabit the mountains, but regularly once a-year   
travel in large troops down to the sea-side to spawn and change   
their shells.  They are seldom used in Jamaica except for soups,   
which are reckoned delicious : that which was brought to me   
was a very small ope, the shell being no bigger than a large   
snail's. although the animal itself , when marching with his house   
on his back, appears to be above thrice the size ; but I am told   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0110" n="91"/>
   
that they are frequently as large as a man's fist.  It was found    
alone in the public road : ow it came to be in so solitary a state   
I know not, for in general they move in a armies, and march   
towards the sea in a straight line ; I am afraid by his being   
found alone, that my soldier must have been a  deserter.

<p>The rain has brought forth the fire-flies, and in the evening   
the hedges are all brilliant with them. In the day they seem to    
be torpid beetles of a dull reddish colour, but at night they become of a   
shining purple. The fire   
proceeds from two small   
spots in the back part of the head.  It is yellow in the light,   
and requires motion to throw out its radiance in perfection ; but   
as soon as it is touched, the fly struggles violently, and bends   
itself together with a clicking noise like the snap of a spring ;   
and I understand that this effort is necessary to set it in motion.   
It is sufficiently strong to turn itself upwards with a single movement, if   
lying on its back. When   
confined in a glass, the light    
seems almost extinguished ; nothing can be discerned but two   
pale yellow spots; but on being pressed by the hand it becomes    
more brilliant than any emerald, and when on the wing it seems    
composed of the most beautifully coloured fire.

<p>I attended the Slave Court, where a negro was tried for sheep   
stealing, and a black servant-girl for attempting to poison her   
master.  The former was sentenced to be transported.  The   
latter was a girl of fifteen, called Minetta : she acknowledged the   
having infused corrosive sublimate in some brandy-and-water;   
but asserted that she had taken it from the medicine-chest with-out knowing it to he poison, and had given it to her master at    
her grandmother's desire. This account was evidently a fabrication : there   
was no doubt of the   
grandmother's innocence,   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0111" n="92"/>
  
</p><p>although some suspicion attached to the mother's influence; but    
as to the girl herself, nothing could be more hardened than her    
conduct through the whole transaction. She stood by the bed    
to see her master drink the poison; witnessed his agonies without one   
expression of surprise or   
pity; and when she was ordered    
to leave the room, she pretended to be fast asleep, and not to    
hear what was said to her. Even since her imprisonment, she    
could never be prevailed upon to say that she was sorry for her    
master's having been poisoned ; and she told the people in the    
jail, that " they could do nothing to her, for she had turned    
king's evidence against her grandmother." She was condemned    
to die on Thursday next, the day after to-morrow: she heard    
the sentence pronounced without the least emotion; and I am   
told that, when she went down the steps of the court-house, she   
was seen to laugh.   
</p><p>  
The trial appeared to be conducted with all possible justice   
and propriety ; the jury consisted of nine respectable persons ;    
the bench of three magistrates, and a senior one to preside.   
There were no lawyers employed on either side ; consequently   
no appeals to passions, no false lights thrown out, no traps,   
no flaws, no quibbles, no artful cross-examinings, and no browbeatings of   
witnesses ; and I   
cannot say that the trial appeared  to   
me to go at all the worse.  Nobody appeared to be either   
for or against the prisoner ; the only object of all present was   
evidently to come at the truth, and I sincerely believe that they   
obtained their object.  The only part of the trial of which I   
disapproved was the ordering the culprit to such immediate execution, that   
sufficient time was   
not allowed for the exercise of   
the royal prerogative, should the governor have been  disposed to   
commute the punishment for that of transportation.

There are many pleasing and amusing parts of the character   
of negroes, that it seems to me scarcely possible not to like   
them.  But when they are once disposed to evil, they seem tp    
set no bounds to the indulgence of their bad passions. a poor   
girl came into the hospital to-day, who had had some trifling    
dispute with two of her companions ; on which the two  friends   
seized her together, and each fixing her teeth on one of the girl's   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0112" n="93"/>
   
hands, bit her so severely, that we greatly fear her losing the use of   
both of them. I happened also to ask, this morning, to whom a   
skull had belonged, which I had observed fixed on a pole by the   
road-side, when returning last from Montego Bay. I was told,    
that about five years ago a Mr. Dunbar had given some discontent    
to his negroes in the article of clothing them, although, in, other   
respects, he was by no means a severe master. However, this    
was sufficient to induce his head driver, who had been brought   
up in his own house from infancy, to form a plot among his   
slaves to assassinate him; and lie was assisted in this laudable   
design by two young men from a neighbouring property, who   
barely knew Mr. Dunbar by sight, had no enmity against him   
whatever, and only joined in the conspiracy in compliment to   
their worthy friend the driver.  During several months a variety   
of attempts were made for effecting their purpose ; but accident   
defeated them ; till at length they were made certain of his intention to   
dine out at some distance,   
and of his being absolutely   
obliged to return in the evening. An ambuscade was therefore   
laid to intercept him ; and on his passing a clump of trees, the   
assassins sprang upon him, the driver knocked him from his   
horse,  and in a few moments their clubs despatched him.  No   
one suspected the driver; but in the course of inquiry, his house   
 as well as the other was searched, and not only Mr. Dunbar's   
watch was found concealed there, but with it one of his ears, which   
the villain had carried away, from a negro belief that, as long as   
the murderer possesses one of the ears of his victim, he will   
never be haunted by his specter. The stranger-youths, two of   
Dunbar's negroes, and the driver were tried, confessed the    
crime, and were all executed; the head of the latter being fixed   
upon a pole  <hi rend="italic"> in terrorem.  </hi> But while the offenders were still in   
prison, the overseer upon a neighbouring property had occasion   
to find fault in the field with a woman belonging to a gang hired   
to perform some particular work ; upon which she flew upon   
him with the greatest fury, grasped him by the throat, cried to   
her fellows&mdash;"Come here! come here! Let us Dunbar him!"   
and through her strength and the suddenness of her attack had   
nearly accomplished her purpose, before his own slaves could   
come to his assistance. this woman was also executed.   
  
</p><p>This happened about five years ago, when the mountains were   
  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0113" n="94"/>
   
in, a very rebellious state. Everything there is at present quiet.   
But only last year a book-keeper belonging to the next estate to   
me was found with his skull fractured in one of my own canepieces; nor   
have any inquiries been   
able to discover the murderer.

During many years the Moravians have been established upon    
the neighbouring estate of Mesopotamia. As the ecclesiastical    
commissaries had said so much to me respecting the great appetite of the   
negroes for religious   
instruction, I was desirous of    
learning what progress had been made in this quarter, and this    
morning I went over to see one of the teachers. He told me,    
that he and his wife had jointly used their best efforts to produce a sense of   
religion in the minds   
of the slaves ; that they   
were all permitted to attend his morning and evening lectures,    
if they chose it; but that he could not say that they showed any    
great avidity on the subject. It seems that there are at least    
three hundred negroes on the estate ; the number of believers    
has rather increased than diminished, to be sure, but still in a   
 very small proportion. When this gentleman arrived there were    
not more than forty baptized persons; he has been here upwards   
of five years, and still the number of persons " belonging to his    
church " (as he expressed it) does not exceed fifty. Of these    
seldom more than ten or a dozen attend his lectures at a time.    
As to the remaining two hundred and fifty, they take no notice    
whatever of his lectures or his exhortations : they are very civil    
to him when they see him, but go on in their own old way,    
without suffering him to interfere in any shape. By the overseer of   
Greenwich's express desire,   
the Moravian has, however,    
agreed to give up an hour every day for the religious instruction    
of the negro children on that property: and I should certainly    
request him to extend his 1abours to Cornwall, if I did not think    
it right to give the Church of England clergymen full room for   
a trial of their intended periodical visitations ; which would not   
be the case if the negroes were to be interfered wit by the professors of any   
other communion :   
otherwise I am myself ready   
to give free inpress and egress upon my several estates to the   
teachers of any Christian sect whatever, the Methodists always   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0114" n="95"/>
  
excepted; but I confess I have no hope of any material benefit    
arising from these religious visitations made at quarterly intervals.

<p> This morning my picture was drawn by a self-taught genius,   
a negro Apelles, belonging to Dr. Pope, the minister; and the   
picture was exactly such as a self-taught genius might be expected to   
produce. It was a straight   
hard outline, without shade   
or perspective: the hair was a large black patch, and the face   
covered with an uniform layer of flesh-colour, with a red spot   
in the centre of each cheek. As to likeness, there was not even   
an attempt to take any. But still, such as they were, there were   
eyes, nose, and mouth, to be sure. A long red nose supplied the   
place of my own snub; an enormous pair of whiskers. stretched   
themselves to the very corner of my mouth; and in place of   
three hairs and a half, the painter, in the superabundance of his   
generosity, bestowed upon me a pair of eye-brows more bushy   
than Dr. Johnson's, and which, being formed in an exact semicircle, made   
the eyes beneath them   
state with an expression of   
the utmost astonishment. The negroes, however, are in the   
highest admiration of the painter's skill, and consider the portrait   
as a striking resemblance; for there is a very blue coat with   
very yellow buttons, and white gaiters and trowsers, and an eyeglass so big   
and so blue, that it   
looks as if I had hung a pewter   
plate about my neck; and a bunch of watch-seals larger than   
those with which Pope has decorated Belinda's great-greatgrandsire. John   
Fuller (to whom,   
jointly with Nicholas, the   
charge of this inestimable treasure is to be entrusted) could not   
find words to express his satisfaction at the performance. " Dere   
massa coat! and dere him chair him sit in! and dere massa   
seals, all just de very same ting ! just all as one ! And oh! ki!   
dere massa pye-glass ! " In the midst of his raptures he dropped   
the picture and fractured the glass. His despair now equalled   
his former joy ; &mdash;" Oh, now what for him do? Such a pity !   
Just to break it after it was all done so well! All so pretty !"   
However,  we stuck the broken glass together with wafers, and   
he carried it off, assuring me, "  that when massa gone, he should    
talk to it every morning, all one as if massa still here." Indeed   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0115" n="96"/>
  
this "talking to massa " is a favourite amusement among the   
negroes, and extremely inconvenient: they come to me perpetually with   
complaints so frivolous,   
and requests so unreasonablethat I am persuaded they invent them only to   
have an excuse for   
" talk to massa; " and when I have given thern a plump refusal,    
theyy go away perfectly satisfied, and " tank massa for dis here

instantly, he abuses him with all his power; " for why him nostop when

" Oh massa, massa! God bless you, massa! me quite,  <hi rend="italic"> quite  </hi> glad

into a roar of laughter so wild and so loud, that the passers-by

To-day being a play-day, the gaiety of the negroes was promoted by a   
distribution of an   
additional quantity of salt-fish    
(which forms a most acceptable ingredient in their pepper-pots),    
and as much rum and sugar as they chose to drink. But there,    
was also a dinner prepared at the house where the "white    
people" reside, expressly for the  <hi rend="italic"> pickaniny-mothers  </hi> only ; that    
is, for the women who had children living. I had taken care,    
when this play day was announced by the head driver, to make   
him inform the negroes that they were indebted for it entirely   
to these mothers ; and to show them the more respect, I went   
to them after dinner myself, and drank their healths.  The   
most respectable blacks on the estate were also assembled in the   
room ;  and I then told them that clothes would wear out, and   
money would be spent, and that I wished to give them something   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0116" n="97"/>
   
more lasting than clothes or money. The law only allows them,   
as a matter of right, every alternate Saturday for themselves, and   
holidays for three days at Christmas, which, with all Sundays,   
forms their whole legal time of relaxation. I therefore granted    
them as a matter of right, and of which no person should deprive   
them on any account whatever,  <hi rend="italic"> every  </hi> Saturday to cultivate their    
grounds; and in addition to their holidays at Christmas, I gave   
them for play-days Good-Friday, the second Friday in October,    
and the second Friday in July. By which means, they will in   
future have the same number of holidays four times a year,    
which hitherto they have been allowed only once,  <hi rend="italic"> i.e </hi> . at Christmas.   
The first is to be called " the   
royal play-day," in honour    
of that excellent Princess, the Duchess of York; and the negroes    
are directed to give three cheers upon the bead driver's announcing "The   
health of our good lady,   
H. R. H. the Duchess of    
York." And I told them, that before my leaving the island, I    
should hear them drink this health, and should not fail to let    
Her Royal Highness know that the negroes of Cornwall drank    
her health every year. This evidently touched the right chord    
of their vanity, and they all bowed and courtesied down to the    
very ground, and said, that would do them much high honour.   
The ninth being my own birthday, the July play-day is to be    
called " the massa's ;" and that in October is to be in honour of   
the picaninny-mothers, from whom it is to take its name.   
</p><p>  
The poor creatures overflowed with gratitude; and the prospective   
indulgences which had just   
been announced gave them   
such an increase of spirits, that on returning to my own residence, they fell   
to singing and   
dancing again with as much   
violence as if they had been a pack of French furies at the Opera.    
The favourite song of the night was,   
   
<q>"Since massa come, we very well off;"</q>  
   
which words they repeated in chorus, without intermission (dancing all the   
time), for 'hours   
together; till, at half-past three, I   
could endure it no longer, and was obliged to send them word   
that I wanted to go to bed, and could not sleep till the noise   
should cease. The idea of my going to bed seemed never to   
have occurred to them till that moment : but now at once the   
drums and gumbies were mute; the children left off singing;   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0117" n="98"/>
   
the women and men left off the dancing ; and they all with one   
accord fell to kicking, pulling, and thumping about two dozen of   
their companions, who were lying fast asleep upon the floor.   
Some of these resisted, some bega fighting, some got up and   
lay down again ; but at length, by dint of leading, carrying, and   
rolling, they got them all away.  To-day my friend Strap, the   
Eboe, came up to the house dressed in his best clothes, to show   
me his seven children ; he marched at their head in all the   
dignity of paternal pride.  he begged me particularly to notice   
two fine little girls, who were twins.  I told him that I had   
seen them already.  "Iss! iss!" he said; "massa see um; but   
massa no  <hi rend="italic"> admire </hi>  um enough yet."  Upon which I fell to   
admiring them. tooth and nail; and the father went away quite   
proud and satisfied.

<p>Yesterday it was observed at George's Palin, an estate about   
four miles off, that the water-mill did not work properly, and it   
was concluded that the grating was clogged up with rubbish.   
To clear it away, a negro immediately jumped down into the   
trench upon a log of wood ; when he felt the log move under   
him, and, of course, jumped out again with all possible expedition.  it was   
then discovered that   
the impediment in question proceeded from a larger aligator which had   
wandered from   
the morass, and , in the hope of finding his way to the river,   
had swum up the mill-trench till he found himself stopped by    
the grating ; and the banks being to high for him to gain them   
by leaping upwards, and the place of his confinement too narrow   
to admit of his turning round to go back again, his escape was    
impossible, and a ball, lodged near his eye, soon put an end to   
him.  I went over to see him this morning ; but I was not contented at   
merely seeing him, so I   
begged to have a steak cut   
off for me, brought it home, and ordered it to be broiled  for   
dinner.  One of the negroes happened to see it in the kitchen ;   
the news spread through the estate like wildfire ; and I had immediately    
half-a-dozen different  deputations, all hoping tha   
massa would not think of eating the alligator, for it was poisonous.    
however, I was obstinate,   
and found the taste of the flesh,   
when broiled with pepper and salt, and assisted by an onion   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0118" n="99"/>
   
sauce, by no means to be despised ; but the consistence of the   
meat was disagreeable, being as tough as a piece of eel-skin.   
Perhaps any body who wishes to eat alligator-steaks in perfection, out to   
keep them for two or   
three days before dressing   
them ; or the animal's age might be in fault, for the fellow was   
so old that he had scarcely a tooth in his head ; I therefore contented   
myself with two or three   
morsels ; but a person who was   
dining with me ate a whole steak, and pronounced the dish to be   
a ery good one.  The eggs are said to be very palatable ; nor    
have the negroes who live near the morasses the same objection   
with those of Cornwall to eating the flesh : it is, however, true   
that the gall of the alligator, if not extracted carefully, will   
render the whole animal unfit for food ; and when this gall is   
reduced to powder, it forms a poison of the most dnagerous   
nature, as the negroes know but too well.

<p>I had given the most positive orders that no person whatever   
should presume to strike a negro, or give him abusive language,   
or, however great the offence might be, should inflict any punishment,   
except by the  sole   
direction of the trustee himself.  Yet,   
although I had already discharged one book-keeper on ths   
account, this evening another of them had a dispute in the   
boiling-house with an African named Frank, because a pool of    
water was not removed fast enough ; upon which he called him   
a rascal, sluiced him with the dirty water, and finally knocked   
him down with a broom.  The African came to me instantly ;   
four eye-witnesses, who were examined separately, proved the   
 truth of his ill-usage ; and I immediately discharged the bookkeeper, who   
had contented himself   
with simply denying the blow   
having been given by him : but I told him that I could not   
possibly allow his single unsupported denial to outweigh five   
concordant witnesses to the assertion : that if he grounded his   
claim to being believed merely upon his having white skin, he   
would find that, on Cornwall estate at least, the claim wwould   
not be admitted ; and that, as the fact was clearly established,   
nothing should induce me to retain him on my property, except   
his finding some means of appeasing the injured negro, and prevailing on   
him to intercede in his   
behalf.  This was an humiliation  
   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0119" n="100"/>
   
to which he could not bring himself to stoop ; and, accordingly, the   
man has left the estate.   
Probably, indeed, the attempt   
at reconciliation would have been unsuccessful ; for when one of   
his companions asked Frank whether, if Mr. Barker would make   
him a present, he had not better take it, and beg massa to let   
him stay, he exclaimed, in the true spirit of a Zanga,&mdash; " No",   
no, no! me no want present! me no want noting! Me no beg   
for Mr. Barker ! him go away ! "&mdash;I was kept awake the greatest   
part of the night by the songs and rejoicings of the negroes at   
their triumph over the offending book-keeper.

The only horned cattle said to be fit for work in Jamaica are   
those which have a great deal of black in them. The white are   
terribly tormented by the insects, and they are weak and sluggish   
in proportion to the quantity of white. On the contrary, I am    
told that such a thing as a black horse is not to be found in the   
island ; those which may be imported black soon change their    
colour into bay; and colts are said to have been dropped perfectly    
black, which afterwards grew lighter and lighter till they arrived

Hearing that a manati (the sea-calf) bad been taken at the    
mouth of the Cabrita River, and was kept alive at the Hope    
Wharf, I got a sailing-boat and went about eight miles to see    
the animal. It was suffered to live in the sea, a rope being fastened round   
it, by which it could be   
landed at pleasure. It was    
a male, and a very young one, not more than nine feet in length,    
whereas they frequently exceed eighteen. The females yield a    
quart of milk at a time: a gentleman told me that he had tasted    
it, and could not have distinguished it from the sweetest cow's    
milk. Unlike the seal, it never comes on shore, although it    
ventures up rivers in the night to feed on the grass of their   
banks; but during the day it constantly inhabits the ocean   
where its chief enemy is the shark, whose attacks it beats off   
with its tail, the strength of which is prodigious. It was killed   
this morning, and the gentleman to whom it belonged was   
obliging enough to send me a part of it : we roasted it for dinner,

<p>One of my house-boys, named Prince, is son to the Duke of Sully; and   
to-day his Grace came to   
beg that, when I shouldleave Jamaica, I would direct the boy to be made a   
tradesman, instead of   
being sent back to be a common field-negro: but my   
own shops are not only full at present, but loaded with future   
engagements., Sully then requested that I would send his son   
to learn some other trade (a tailor's, for instance) at Savannah   
la Mar, as had been frequently done in former times ; but this   
also I was obliged to refuse.  I told him, that formerly a master   
could pay for the apprenticeship of a clever negro boy, and, instead of   
employing him afterwards   
on the estate, could content   
himself with being repaid by a share of the profits ; but that,   
since the Abolition bad made it impossible for the proprietor of   
an estate to supply the place of one negro by the purchase of another, it   
would be unjust to his   
companions to suffer any one in   
particular to be withdrawn from service; as in that case two   
hundred and ninety-nine would have to do the work which is   
now performed by three hundred ; and, therefore, I could allow   
my negroes to apply themselves to no trades but such as related   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0121" n="102"/>
  
to the business of the property, such as carpenters, coopers,   
smiths, &amp;c. " All true, massa," said Sully ; " all fair and just;   
and, to be sure, a tailor or a saddler would be of no great   
use towards planting and getting in your crop; nor&mdash;"   
He hesitated for a moment, and then added, with a look of   
doubt, and in a lower voice, " Nor&mdash;nor a fiddler either, I suppose, massa ?   
I began to laugh. " No,   
indeed, Sully.; nor a   
fiddler either
</p><p>It seems the lad, who is about sixteen, and   
somewhat stupid, has a passion for playing the fiddle, and, among   
other trades, had suggested this to his father as one which would   
be extremely to his taste. We finally settled that, when the   
plough should be introduced on my estate (which I am very,   
anxious to accomplish, and substitute the labour of oxen for that   
of negroes, wherever it can possibly be done), Prince should be   
instructed in farming business; and, in the meanwhile, should   
officiate as a pen-keeper to look after the cattle.   
</p><p>  
Just now Prince came to me with a request of his own:   
Massa, please, me want one little coat."-" A little coat! for    
what?" " Massa, please, for wear when me go down to the    
Bay." "And why should you wear a little coat when you go to   
the Bay ? "&mdash;" Massa, please, make me look eerie (buckish) when   
me go abroad." So I assured him that be looked quite  <hi rend="italic"> eerie  </hi>    
enough already ; and that, as I was going away too soon to admit of my   
seeing him in his little   
coat, there could not be the    
slightest occasion for his being a bit  <hi rend="italic"> eerier </hi>  than he was. A    
master in England would probably have been not a little astonished at   
receiving such a request   
from one of his groom-boys ;    
but here one gets quite accustomed to them ; and when they are    
refused, the petitioners themselves frequently laugh at their    
own unreasonableness.

Most of those negroes who are tolerably industrious, breed   
cattle on my estate, which are their own property, and by the   
sale of which they obtain considerable sums. The pasturage of   
a steer would amount, in this Muntry, to 12 <hi rend="italic"> 1 </hi> . a-year;  but the   
negroes get grass for their cattle from me without its costing   
them a farthing; and as they were very desirous that I should

<p>Since my arrival in Jamaica I am not conscious of having    
omitted any means of satisfying my Negroes, and rendering them   
happy and secure from oppression. I have suffered no person to    
punished, except the two female demons who almost bit a    
xxx hands off (for which they received a slight Switching), and   
the most worthless rascal on the estate, whom for manifold   
offences I was compelled, for the sake of discipline, to allow to   
pass two days in the bilboes. I have never refused a favour that   
I could possibly grant. I have listened patiently to all com   
plaints.  I have increased the number of negro holidays, and    
have given away money and presents of all kinds incessantly.   
</p><p> Now for my reward. On Saturday morning there were no    
fewer than forty-five persons (not including children) in the    
hospital which makes nearly a fifth of my whole gang.  Of   
these the medical people assured me that not above seven had   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0123" n="104"/>
   
anything whatever the matter with them ; the rest were only   
 feigning sickness, out of mere idleness, and in order to sit doing    
nothing, while their companions were forced to perform their    
part of the estate-duty. And sure enough, on Sunday morning    
they all walked away from the hospital to amuse themselves, except about   
seven or eight: they   
will, perhaps, go to the field for    
a couple of days, and on Wednesday we may expect to have    
them all back again, complaining of pains which (not existing)    
it is not possible to remove. Jenny (the girl whose hands were    
bitten) was told by the doctoress, that having been in the hospital    
all the week, she ought not, for very shame, to go out on Sunday. She   
answered, " She wanted to   
go to the mountains, and    
go she would." " Then," said the doctoress, " you must not    
come back again on Monday at least." " Yes," Jenny said, " she    
 <hi rend="italic"> should  </hi> come back:" and back this morning Jenny came. But    
as her wounds were almost well, she had tied packthread round    
them so as to cut deep into the flesh, had rubbed dirt into them,    
and, in short, bad played such tricks as nearly to produce mortification in   
one of her fingers.   
</p><p>  The most worthless fellow on the whole property is one Nato    
&mdash;a thief, a liar, a runaway, and one who has never been two    
days together out of the hospital since my arrival, although he    
has nothing the matter with him : indeed, when the other negroes    
abused him for his laziness, and leaving them to do his work for   
him, he told them plainly that he did not mean to work and   
that nobody should make him. The only real illness which    
brought him to the hospital, within my knowledge, was the consequence of   
a beating received   
from his own father, who had   
caught him in the act of robbing his house by the help of a false    
key. In the hospital lie found his wife, Philippa, the mad woman, with   
whom he instantly   
quarrelled, and she cut his head    
open with a plate; and as she might have served one of the children in the   
same way, we were   
obliged to confine her. Her   
husband was thought to be the fittest person to guard her; and,    
accordingly, they were locked up together in a separate room   
from the other invalids, till a strait waistcoat could be made.   
The husband was then restored to freedom, and desired to go to   
work, which he declared to be impossible from illness; yet he   
disapeared the whole of the next day, and on his return the   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0124" n="105"/>
   
following morning he had the impudence to assert that he had   
never been out of the hospital for an hour. For this runaway   
offence, and for endeavouring to exasperate his wife's phrenzy,   
vqs put into the bilboes for two days: on the third he was   
released, when he came to me with tears in his eyes, implored   
me most earnestly to forgive what had passed, and promised   
to behave better for the future " to so good a niassa." It appeared   
afterwards that he had employed   
his absence in complaining to Mr Williams, a neighbouring magistrate,   
that, " having   
a spite against them; although neither he nor his wife had committed any   
fault, I had punished   
them both by locking them up   
for several days in a solitary prison, under pretence of his wife's   
insanity, when in fact she was perfectly in her senses." Unluckily, one of   
my physicians had told   
Mr. Williams, that very   
morning, how much he had been alarmed at Cornwall, when,   
upon going into a mad woman's room, her husband had fastened   
the door, and he had found himself shut up between them -the   
woman really mad, and the man pretending to be so too. The   
moment that Nato mentioned the mad woman as his wife,   
"What, then," said Mr. Williams, "you are the fellow who   
alarmed the doctor so much two days ago?" Upon which Nato   
had the impudence to burst into a fit of laughter,&mdash;" Oh, ki,    
massa, doctor no need be fright ; we no want to hurt him; only    
make lilly bit fun wid him, massa, that all." On which he was    
ordered to get out of Mr. Williams's house; slunk back into the    
Cornwall hospital, and in a few days came to me with such a    
long story of penitence, and " so good a massa," that he induced    
me to forgive him.   
</p><p>   
 To sum up the whole, about three this morning an alarm was    
given that the pen-keeper had suffered the cattle to get among    
the canes, where they might do infinite mischief: the trustee    
was roused out of his bed-the drivers blew their shells to sum-mon the negroes to their assistance&mdash;when it appeared that there   
was not a single watchman at his post; the watch-fires had all    
been suffered to expire ; not a single domestic was to be found,   
nor a horse to be procured; even the little servant-boys, whom    
the trustee had locked up in his own house, and had left fast    
asleep when he went to bed, had got up again, and made their    
escape to pass the night in play and rioting : and although they   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0125" n="106"/>
   
were perfectly aware of the detriment which the cattle were   
doing to my interests, not a negro could be prevailed upon to    
rouse himself and help to drive them out, till at length Cubina    
(who had run down from his own house to mine on the first    
alarm) with difficulty collected about half a dozen to assist him :    
but long before this, one of my best cane-pieces was trampled to    
pieces, and the produce of this year's crop considerably dimi-nished.&mdash;And so much for negro gratitude! However, they    
still continue their eternal song of " Now massa come, we very   
well off;" but their satisfaction evidently begins and ends with   
themselves. They rejoice sincerely at being very well off but   
think it unnecessary to make the slightest return to massa for   
making them so.

<p>Nato has kept his promise up to this time, and has actually   
passed a whole week in the field ; a thing which he was never   
known to do before within the memory of man.</p>   
<p>So I sent him a   
piece of money to encourage him ; and told him that I sent him    
a  <hi rend="italic"> maccarony </hi>  for behaving well, and wished to know whether any    
one had ever given him a maccarony for behaving ill. I hear    
that he was highly delighted at my thinking him worthy to receive a   
present from me, and sent   
me in return the most positive    
assurances of perseverance in good conduct. On the other hand,    
Mackaroo has not only run away himself, but has carried his    
wife away with him. This is improving upon the profligacy of    
British manners with a vengeance. In England, a man only    
runs away with another person's wife: but to run away with    
his own-what depravity ! As to my ungrateful demigod of a    
sheep-stealer, Hercules, the poor wretch has brought down upon    
himself a full punishment for all his misdeeds. By running   
away; and  sleeping in the woods, exposed to all the fury of the   
late heavy rains, he has been struck by the palsy.</p>   
<p>Yesterday   
some of my negroes found him in the mountains, unable to raise   
himself from the ground, and brought him in a cart to the hospital ; where   
he now lies, having   
quite lost the use of one side,   
and in every other respect strong and healthy; so that he may    
look forward to a long and miserable existence.

<p>The shaddock contains generally thirty-two seeds, two, of    
which only will reproduce shaddocks ; and these two it is impossible to   
distinguish : the rest will   
yield, some sweet oranges,    
others bitter ones, others again forbidden fruit, and, in short, all    
the varieties of the orange ; but until the trees actually are in    
bearing, no one can guess what the fruit is likely to prove ; and    
even then, the seeds which produce shaddocks, although taken    
from a tree remarkable for the excellence of its fruit, will frequently yield   
only such as are   
scarcely eatable. So also the    
varieties of the mango are infinite -the fruit of no two trees    
resembling each other ; and the seeds of the very finest mango    
(although sown and cultivated with the utmost care) seldom    
affording anything at all like the parent stock. The two first    
mangoes which I tasted were nothing but turpentine and sugar;   
the third was very delicious and yet I was told that it was by no    
means of a superior quality. The  <hi rend="italic"> sweet  </hi> cassava requires no    
preparation ; the  <hi rend="italic"> bitter </hi>  cassava, unless the juice is carefully    
pressed out of it, is a deadly poison ; there is a third kind, called    
the  <hi rend="italic"> sweet-and-bitter  </hi> cassava, which is perfectly wholesome till a   
certain age, when it acquires its deleterious qualities. Many   
persons have been poisoned by mistaking these various kinds of    
cassava for each other.   
</p><p>One of the best vegetable productions of the island is esteemed    
to be the Avogada pear, sometimes called " the vegetable marrow." It was   
not the proper season   
for them, and with great    
dfifficulty I procured a couple, which were said to be by no    
means in a state of perfection. Such as they were, I could find    
no great merit in them; they were to be eaten cold with pepper    
and salt, and seemed to be an insipid kind of melon,  with no    
other resemblance to marrow than their softness.   
</p><p> As soon as the plantain has done bearing, it is cut down ;   
when four or five suckers spring from each root, which become   
plants themselves in their turn. Ratoons are suckers of the    
sugar-cane : they are far preferable to the original plants, where   
the soil is rich enough to support them ; but they are much   
better adapted to some estates than to others. Thus, on my   
estate in St. Thomas's in the East, they can allow of ten ratoons   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0127" n="108"/>
   
from the same plant, and only dig cane-holes every eleventh    
year ; while, at Cornwall, the strength of the cane is exhausted    
in the fourth ratoon, or the fifth at furthest. The fresh plants    
are cane-tops ; but those canes which bear  <hi rend="italic"> flags </hi>  or feathers at   
their extremities will not answer the purpose, as dry weatber    
easily burns up the sligrht arrows to which the flags adhere, and    
destroys them before they can acquire sufficient vigour to resist   
the climate.

I find that I have not done justice to the cotton-tree. Those    
I first saw were either withered by age, or struck by lightning,    
or happened to be ill-shaped of their kind ; but I have since    
met with others, than which nothing could be more noble or    
picturesque, from their gigantic height, the immense spread of    
their, arms, the colour of their steins and leaves, and the wild   
fantastic wreathings of their roots and branches.

Nothing can be larger and finer in appearance than the    
Jamaica poultry of all kinds, but nothing can be uniformly more    
tough and tasteless ; and the same is the case with all butcher's    
meat, pork excepted, which is much better here than in Europe.    
The fault is in the climate, which prevents any animal food from    
being kept sufficiently long to become tender; so that when a    
man sits down to a Jamaica dinner, he might almost fancy himself    
a guest at Macbeth's-Covent-Garden banquet, where the fowls,    
hams, and legs of mutton are all made of deal boards. I ordered    
a duck to be kept for two days ; but it was so completely spoiled,    
that there was no bearing it upon the table. Then I tried the    
expedient of boiling a fowl till it absolutely fell to pieces ; but    
even this violent process had not the power of rendering it    
tender. The only effect produced by it was, that instead of    
being helped to a wing of solid wood, I got a plateful of splinters.    
Perhaps, my having totally lost my appetite (from the climate    
Dot allowing me to take my usual exercise) makes the meat appear to me   
less palatable than it   
may to others ; but I have   
observed that most people here prefer living upon soups, stews,   
and salted provisions.  For my own part, I have for the last few   
weeks eaten nothing except black crabs, than which I never met   
with a more delicious article for the table.  I have also tried   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0128" n="109"/>
   
the  <hi rend="italic">soldier </hi>  soup, which is in great estimation in this island ; but    
although it greatly resembled the very richest cray-fish soup, it    
seemed to me to be composed of cray-fish which had been kept   
too long. The  <hi rend="italic"> soldiers </hi>  themselves were perfectly fresh, for they   
were brought to the kitchen quite alive and merry ; but I was   
told that this taste of staleness is their peculiar flavour, as well    
as their peculiar scent even when alive, and is precisely the   
quality which forms their recommendation. It was quite enough   
fix my opinion of the soup: I took two spoonfuls, and never    
mean to venture on a third.   
</p><p>   
To fill up my list of Jamaica delicacies, I must not forget to   
mention, that I did my best to procure a Cane-piece Cat roasted   
in the true African fashion. The Creole negroes, however,   
greatly disapproved of my venturing upon this dish, which they   
positively denied having tasted themselves ; and when, at length,   
the Cat was procured, last Saturday, instead of  plainly boiling   
it with negro-pepper and salt, they made it into a high-seasoned   
stew, which rendered it impossible to judge of its real flavour.   
However, I tasted it, as did also several other people, and we   
were unanimous in opinion that it might have been mistaken   
for a very good game-soup, and that, when properly dressed, a   
Cane-piece Cat must be excellent food.

<p>The most general of negro infirmities appears to be that of   
lameness.  It is chiefly occasioned by the  <hi rend="italic"> chiga,  </hi> a diminutive   
fly which works itself into the feet to lay its eggs, and, if it be   
not carefully extracted in time, the flesh around it corrupts, and   
a sore ensues not easily to be cured.  No vigilance can prevent   
the attacks of the chiga; and not only soldiers,  but the very   
cleanest persons of the highest rank in society, are obliged to    
have their feet examined regularly.  The negroes are all provided with   
small knives for the   
purpose of extracting them :   
but as no pain is felt till the sore is produced, their extreme   
laziness frequently makes them neglect that precaution, till all   
kinds of dirt getting into the wound, increases the difficulty of a   
cure ; and sometimes the consequence is lameness for life.

<p>The Reporter of the African Institution asserts, in a late    
pamphlet, that in the West Indies the breeding system is to this    
day discouraged, and that the planters are still indifferent to the    
preservation of their present stock of negroes, from their confidence of   
getting fresh supplies   
from Africa. Certainly the    
negroes in Jamaica are by no means of this Reporter's opinion,    
but are thoroughly sensible of their intrinsic value in the eyes of    
the proprietor. On my arrival, every woman who had a child    
held it up to show me, exclaiming-," See, massa, see! here nice    
new neger me bring for work for massa;" and those who had    
more than one did not fail to boast of  the number, and make it    
a claim to the greater merit with me.  Last week,  an old    
watchman was brought home from the mountains almost dead    
with fever ;  he would neither move, nor speak, nor notice any   
one, for several days. For two nights I sent him soup from my    
own table ; but he could not even taste it, and always gave it to    
his daughter. On the third evening there happened to be no   
soup at dinner, and I sent other food instead ; but old Cudjoe    
had been accustomed to see the soup arrive, and the disappointment made   
him fancy himself   
hungry, and that he could have    
eaten the soup if it had been brought as usual : accordingly when I visited   
him the next morning,   
he bade the doctoress tell me that massa had sent him no soup the night   
before. This    
was the first notice that he had ever taken of me. I promised    
that some soup should be ordered for him on purpose, that    
evening. Could be fancy anything to eat  <hi rend="italic"> then </hi> ?-"  "Milk!     
milk !"  So milk was sent to him, and he drank two full calabashes   
of it.  I then tried him with an egg, which lie also got down    
and at night, by spoonfuls at a time, he finished the whole bason   
of soup ; but when I next came to see him, and he wished to    
thank me, the words in which he thought he could comprise    
most gratitude were bidding the doctoress tell me he would do   
his best not todie yet ; he promised to  <hi rend="italic"> fight hard </hi>  for it.  He is   
now quite out of danger, and seems really to be grateful.  When   
he was sometimes too weak to speak, on my leaving the room   
he would drag his hand to his mouth with difficulty, and kiss it   
three orfour times to bid me farewell ; and once, when the

doctoress mentioned his having charged her to tell me that he   
owed his recovery to the good food that I had sent him, he   
added, "  And him kind words too, massa ; kind words do neger   
much good, much as good food."  
   
</p><p> In my visits to the old man, I observed a young woman    
nursing him with an infant in her arms, which (as they told me)    
was her own, by Cudjoe. I therefore supposed her to be his    
wife : but I found that she belonged to a  <hi rend="italic"> brown  </hi> man in the   
mountains ; and that Cudjoe hired her from her master, at the   
rate of thirty pounds a-year !   
</p><p> I hope this fact will convince the African  <hi rend="italic"> Reporter  </hi> that it   
is possible for some of this " oppressed race of human beings"

at least  <hi rend="italic"> some  </hi> of the luxuries of civilized society; and I doubt

would not allow a negro to be quite rich enough, who can afford   
thirty pounds a year for the hire of a kept mistress.

<p>On opening the Assize-court for the county of Cornwall on   
March 4, Mr. Stewart, the Custos of Trelawny, and Presiding   
Judge, said, in his charge to the jury, he wished to direct their   
attention in a peculiar manner to the infringement of slave-laws   
in the island, in consequence of charges having been brought   
forward in England of slave-laws not being enforced in this   
country, and of their being in fact perfect dead letters. The charge   
was unfounded; but it became proper, in consequence, for the bench   
call in a strong manner on the grand jury to be particularly   
vigilant and attentive to the discharge of this part of their duty.   
The bench at the same time adverted to another subject connected with the   
above.   Many out of   
the country, and  <hi rend="italic"> some in </hi>    
 <hi rend="italic"> it </hi> , had thought proper to interfere with our system, and by   
their insidious practices and dangerous doctrines to call the   
peace of the island into question, and to promote disorder and   
confusion. The jury were therefore enjoined, in every such case,   
to investigate it thoroughly, and to bring the parties concerned   
before the country, and not to suffer the systems of the island,   
as established by the laws of the land, to be overset or endangered.  It was   
their bounden duty to   
watch over aud support 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002076_missing_page" n="112"/> 
   
the established laws, and to act against those who dared to infringe them ;   
and that, otherwise, it   
was imperiously called for    
on the principle of self-preservation. Every country had its    
peculiar laws, on the due maintenance of which depended the    
public safety and welfare. I read all this with the most perfect    
unconsciousness: when, lo and behold! I have been assured,    
from a variety of quarters, that all this was levelled at myself!    
It is I (it seems) who am " calling the peace of the island in    
question who am " promoting disorder and confusion;" and    
who am infringing the established laws! " I should never    
have guessed it! By " insidious practices" is meant (as I am    
told) my over-indulgence to my negroes ; and my endeavouring to obtain   
either redress or pardon   
for those belonging to other estates, who occasionally appeal to me for   
protection : while " dangerous doctrines " alludes to the opinions I   
have expressed, that the evidence of negroes ought at least to be    
 <hi rend="italic"> heard  </hi> against white persons.   
</p><p>  
My opinion is most decided that they ought to be heard ; the    
jury, of course, always making proportionable abatements of    
belief, from, bearing in mind the bad habits of most negroes,    
their general want of probity and good faith in every respect,    
and their total ignorance of the nature of religious obligations    
At the same time, these defects may be counterbalanced by the   
respectable character of the particular negro ; by the strength    
of corroborating circumstances; and, finally, by the irresistible    
conviction which his evidence may leave upon the minds of the    
jury. They are not obliged to  <hi rend="italic"> believe  </hi> a negro witness, but I    
maintain that he ought to be  <hi rend="italic"> heard,  </hi> and then let the jury give    
their verdict according to their conscience. But this, in the    
opinion of the bench at Montego Bay, it seems, is " dangen    
doctrine ! " At least, the venom of my doctrines is circumscribed within   
very narrow limits; for,   
as I have made a point    
of  never stirring off my own estate, nobody could possibly be   
corrupted by them except those who were at the trouble of   
walking into my house for the express purpose of being corrupted.  
   
</p><p> At all events, if I really am the person whom Mr. Stewart   
alluded, I must consider his speech as the most flattering compliment I   
ever received.  if my   
presence in the island had made   
   
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0130" n="113"/>
   
the bench of a whole country think it necessary to exact from    
the jury a more severe vigilance than usual in all causes relating    
to the protection of negroes, I cannot but own myself most richly    
rewarded for all my pains and expense in coming hither, for    
every risk of the voyage, and for every possible sacrifice of my    
pleasures. There is nothing earthly that is too much to give   
for the power of producing an effect so beneficial; and I would    
set off for Constantinople to-morrow, could I only be convinced    
that my arrival would make the Mufti redress the complaints of    
the lower orders of Turks with more scrupulous justice, and the    
Bashaws relax the fetters of their slaves as much as their safety    
would permit. But I cannot flatter myself with having done    
either the one or the other in Jamaica; and if Mr. Stewart    
 <hi rend="italic"> really </hi>  alluded to me in his charge, I am certainly greatly obliged    
to him; but he has paid me much too high a compliment ;-God grant that I   
may live to deserve it!

It is to be wished, that the negroes would content themselves    
with their occasional amusements of poisoning, stabbing, thieving,   
&amp;c., on a small scale ; but a   
plan has just been discovered    
in the adjoining parish of St. Elizabeth's, for giving, themselves a    
grand fete by murdering all the whites in the island. The focus    
of this meditated insurrection was on Martin's Penn, the property of Lord   
Balcarras, where the   
overseer is an old man of the    
mildest character, and the negroes had always been treated with    
peculiar indulgence. Above a thousand persons were engaged   
in the plot, three hundred of whom had been regularly sworn to    
assist in it with all the usual accompanying ceremonies of drinking human   
blood, eating earth   
from graves, &amp;c. Luckily, the    
plot was discovered time enough to prevent any mischief; and

Mr. Plummer came over from St. James's to-day, and told.   
me that the " insidious practices and dangerous doctrines " in    
Mr. Stewart's speech were intended for the Methodists, and that    
only the charge to the grand jury respecting " additional vigilance " was in   
allusion to myself ;   
but he added that it was the    
report at Montego Bay, that, in consequence of my over-indulgence to my   
negroes, a song had   
been made at Cornwall, declaring that I was come over to set them all free,   
and that this was    
now circulating through the neighbouring parishes. If there be   
any such song (which I do not believe), I certainly never heard   
it. However, my agent here says, that he has reason to believe    
that my negroes really hav~ spread the report that I intend to    
set  <hi rend="italic"> them  </hi> free in a few years ; and that they have done this

The two ringleaders of the. proposed rebellion at St. Elizabeth's have been

uncommon concourse of stranger negroes at a child's funeral, on   
which occasion a hog was roasted by the father.  he stole softly   
down to the feasting-hut, and listened behind the hedge to the   
conversation of the supposed mourners ; when he heard the

a Creole was among them.  But there was a  <hi rend="italic"> black </hi>  ascertained    
to have stolen over into the island from St. Domingo, and a   
 <hi rend="italic"> brown </hi>  Anabaptist missionary, both of whom had been very

active in promoting the plot.  hey had elected a King of the   
Eboes, who had two captains under him ; and their intention   
was to effect a complete massacre of all whites on the   
island ; for which laudable design His Majesty thought Christmas was the   
very fittest season in   
the year, but his Captains were   
more impatient, and were for the striking the blow immediately.   
The next morning information was given against them : one   
of the Captains escaped to the woods ; but the other, and the    
King of the Eboes, were seized and brought to justice.  On   
theor trial they were perfectly cool and unconcerned, and did not   
even profess to deny the facts with which they were charged.   
Indeed, proofs were too strong to admit of denial ; among others,   
a copy of the following song was found upon the King, which   
the overseer had heard him sing at the funeral feast, while the   
other negroes joined in the chorus :-</p>   
  
  
<lg type="verse"><l>SONG OF THE KING OF THE EBOES.</l>  
<l>Oh me good friend, Mr. Wilberforce, make we free!</l>   
<l>God Almighty thank ye! God Almighty thank ye!</l>   
<l>God Almighty, make we free!</l></lg>   
  
<lg type="verse"><l>Buckra in this country no make we free:</l>  
<l>What Negro for to do? What Negro for to do?</l>  
<l>Take force by force! Take force by force!</l></lg>  
  
<lg type="verse"><l>CHORUS.</l>   
<l>To be sure! to be sure! to be sure!</l></lg>   
  
  
<p>The Eboe King said, that he certainly had made use of this   
song, and what harm was there in his doing so ? He had sung   
no songs but such as his brown priest had assured him were approved of   
by john the Baptist.  "   
And who, then, was John the   
Baptist?"  He did not very well know ; only he had been told   
by his brown priest, that John the Baptist was a friend to the   
negroes, and had got his head in a pan!   
</p><p> As to the Captain, he only said in his defence, that if the   
court would forgive him this once, he would not do so again,   
"as he found the whites did not like their plans;"  which, it   
seems, till that moment the conspirators had never suspected!   
They had all along imagined, no doubt, that the whites would   
find as much amusement in having their throats cut, as the   
blacks would find in cutting them.  I remember hearing a   
sportsman, who was defending the humanity of hunting, maintain,   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0133" n="116"/>
  
that it being as much the nature of a hare to run away as of    
a dog to run after her, consequently the hare must receive as   
much pleasure from being coursed, as the dog from coursing.

<p>Two negroes upon Amity estate quarrelled the other day    
about some trifle, when the one bit the other's nose off completely. Soon

<p>Every Sunday since my return from Kingston I have read    
prayers to such of the negroes as chose to attend, preparatory to    
the intended visitations of the minister, Dr. Pope. About    
twenty or thirty of the most respectable among them generally    
attended and behaved with great attention and propriety. I    
read the Litany, and made them repeat the responses. I explained the   
Commandments and the   
Lord's Prayer to them    
teaching them to say each sentence of the latter after me, as I    
read it slowly, in hopes of impressing it upon their memory.   
Then came " the good Samaritan," or some such apologue; and,    
lastly, I related to them a portion of the life of Christ, and explained to   
them the object of his   
death and sufferings. The    
latter part of my service always seemed to interest them greatly ;    
but, indeed, they behaved throughout with much attention.   
Unluckily, the head driver, who was one of the most zealous of,    
my disciples, never could repeat the responses of the Litany   
without an appeal to myself, and always made a point of saying    
&mdash;" Good Lord, deliver us; yes, sir! " and made me a low bow.   
Like my friend the Moravian, at Mesopotamia, I cannot boast    
of any increased audience; and if the negroes will not come to    
hear massa, I have little hope of their giving up their time to   
hear Dr. Pope, who inspires them with no; interest, and can   
exert no authority. Indeed, I am afraid that I am indebted for   
the chief part of my present auditory to my quality of massa   
rather than that of priest; and when I ask any of them why they    
did not come to prayers on the preceding Sunday, their excuse   
   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0134" n="117"/>
   
is always coupled with an assurance that they wished very much    
to come, " because they wish to do  <hi rend="italic"> anything  </hi> to oblige massa."

<p>The negroes certainly are perverse beings. They had been   
praying for a sight of their master year after year; they were in   
raptures at my arrival ; I have suffered no one to be punished,    
and shown them every possible indulgence during my residence    
amongst them; and one and all they declare themselves perfectly happy   
and well treated. Yet,   
previous to my arrival,    
they made thirty-three hogsheads a-week; in a fortnight after    
my landing, their product dwindled to twenty-three; during this    
last week they have managed to make but thirteen. Still they    
are not ungrateful; they are only selfish: they love me very    
well, but they love themselves a great deal better; and, to do    
them justice, I verily believe that every negro on the estate is ex-tremely anxious that all should do their full duty, except himself.    
My censure, although accompanied with the certainty of their    
not being punished, is by no means a matter of indifference. If    
I express myself to be displeased, the whole property is in an    
uproar; everybody is finding fault with everybody; there is    
nobody that does not represent the shame of neglecting my work,    
and the ingratitude of vexing me by their ill-conduct ; and then    
each individual-having said so much and said it so strongly, that    
he is convinced of its having its full effect in making the others   
do their duty-thinks himself quite safe and snug in skulking    
away from his own.

<p>Young Hill was told at the Bay this morning, that I make a   
part of the,Eboe King's song ! According to this report, " good   
King George and good Mr. Wilberforce " are stated to have   
"given me a paper " (  <hi rend="italic"> i. e. </hi>  an order ) to set the negroes free, but   
that the white people of Jamaica will not suffer me to show the   
paper, and that I am now going home to say so, and " to resume   
my place, which I have left during my absence to be filled by   
the Regent.   
</p><p> Since I heard the report of a rebellious song issuing from   
Cornwall, I have listened more attentively to the negro chants;   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0135" n="118"/>
   
but they seem, as far as I can make out, to relate entirely to    
their own private situation, and to have nothing to do with the    
negro state in general.  Their favourite, " We varry well off,"    
is still screamed about the estate by the children; but among   
the grown-up people its nose has been put out of joint by the following   
stanzas, which were   
explained to me this morning. For    
several days past they had been dinned into my ears so incessantly, that at   
length I became quite   
curious to know their import, which I learned from Phillis, who is the   
family-minstrel.    
It will be evident from this specimen, that the Cornwall, bards    
are greatly inferior to those of Black River, who have actually    
advanced so far as to make an attempt at rhyme and metre.</p>

<p>An alligator, crossing the morass at Bellisle, an estate but a    
few miles distant from Cornwall, fell into a water-trench, from    
which he struggled in vain to extricate himself, and was taken    
alive. Fontenelli says, that when Copernicus published his    
system, he foresaw the contradictions which he should have to    
undergo-" et il se tira d'affaire tres-habilement. Le jour qu'on    
lui presentoit le premier exemplaire, scavez-vous ce qu'il fit?    
Il mourut;" which was precisely the resource resorted to by the    
alligator. He died on the second morning of his captivity, and his   
proprietor, Mr. Storer, was obliging enough to order the skin to   
be stuffed, and to make me a present of him.  Neptune was despatched to   
bring him (or rather   
her, for nineteen eggs wer found   
within her) over to Cornwall ; and at dinner to-day we were   
alarmed with a general hubbub.  It proved to be the occasion by   
the arrival of Neptune with the alligator on his head.  In a few   
minutes everything on the estate that was alive, without feathers,   
and with only two legs, flocked into the room, and requested to   
alloowed to take a bird's-eye view of the monster ; for as to   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0136" n="119"/>
   
coming near her,  <hi rend="italic"> that </hi>  they were much too cowardly to venture.    
It was in vain that I represented to them, that being dead it was    
utterly impossible that the animal could hurt them : they allowed    
the impossibility, but still kept at a respectful distance ; and when    
at length I succeeded in persuading them to approach it, upon    
some one accidentally moving the alligator's tail, they all, with    
one accord, set up a loud scream, and men, women, and children   
tumbled out of the room over one another, to the irreparable    
ruin of some of my glasses and decanters, and the extreme trepidation of   
the whole sideboard.

The negro-husband, who stabbed his rival in a fit of jealousy,    
has been tried at Montego Bay, and acquitted. On the other    
hand, the King of the Eboes has been hung at Black River, and    
died, declaring that he left enough of his countrymen to prosecute the   
design in hand, and   
revenge his death upon the whites.    
Such threats of a rescue were held out, that it was judged advisable to put   
the militia under arms,   
till the execution should   
have taken place; and also to remove the King's Captain to the    
jail at Savannah-la-Mar, till means can be found for transporting him from   
the island.

<p>The Eboe captain has effected his escape by burning down the   
prison door.  It is supposed that he has fled. towards the fastnesses in the   
interior of the   
mountains, where I am assured that   
many settlements of runaway slaves have been formed, and with   
which the inhabited part of the island has no communication.   
However, the chief of the Accompong Maroons, Captain Roe, is   
gone in pursuit of him, and has promised to bring him in, alive   
or dead.  The latter is the only reasonable expectation, as the   
fugitive is represented as a complete desperado.   
</p><p> The negroes have at least given me one proof of their not    
being entirely selfish.   When they beard that the boat was come    
to convey my baggage to the ship at Black river, they collected   
all their poultry and brought it to my agent, desiring him to add   
it to my sea-stores. Of course I refused to let it be received,   
and they were evidently much disappointed till I consented to   
accept the fowls and ducks,  and then gave them back to them   
again, telling them to consider them as a present from my own

<p>About two months ago, a runaway cooper belonging to   
Shrewsbury estate, by name Edward, applied to me to intercede    
for his not being punished on his return home. As soon as he    
got the paper, he gave up all idea of returning to the estate, and    
instead of it went about the country stealing everything upon    
which he could lay his hands; and whenever his proceedings    
were inquired into by the magistrates, he stated himself to be on    
the road to his trustee, and produced my letter as a proof of it.    
At length some one had the curiosity to open the letter, and    
found that it bad been written two months before.

<p>This was the day appointed for the first " Royal play-day,"    
when I bade farewell to my negroes. I expected to be besieged    
with petitions and complaints, as they must either make them on    
this occasion or not at all. I was, therefore, most agreeably surprised to   
find, that although they   
had opportunities of addressing   
me from nine in the morning till twelve at night the only favours   
asked of me were by a poor old man, who wanted an iron  cookingpot, and   
by Adam, who   
begged me ot order a kittke daughter of   
his to be instructed in needle-work : and as to complaints, not a   
murmur of such a thing was heard ; they all expressed themselves to be   
wuite satisfied, and   
seemed to think that they could   
never say enough to mark their gratitude for my kindness, and   
their anxiety for my getting safe to England.  we began our   
festival by the head driver's drinking the health of H. R. H. the    
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0138" n="121"/>
   
Duchess of York, whom the negroes cheered with such a shout    
as might have " rent hell's concave."   
</p><p> Then we had a christening of such persons as had been absent   
on the former occasion, one of whom was Adam, the repute   
Obeah-man.  In the number was a new-born child, whom we   
called Sheakespeare, and whom Afra, the Eboe mother, had very   
earnestly begged me to make a Christian, as well as a daughter   
of hers about four or five years old, at the same time that she   
declined being christened herself ! In the same manner Cubina's   
wife, although her father and husband wer both baptized on    
the former occasion, objected to going through the ceremony   
herself ; amd the reason which she gave was, that " she did not   
know what change it might not  produce upon herslef and the    
infant."   
</p><p> After the christening there was a general distribution of saltfish by the   
trustee ; and I also gave   
every man and woman half   
a dollar each, and every child a maccarony (fifteen pence) as a   
parting present, to show them that I parted with them in good   
humour.  While the money was distributing young Hill arrived,   
and finding the house completely crowded, inquired what was   
the matter.  " Oh, massa," said an old woman, " it is only  <hi rend="italic"> my </hi>    
 <hi rend="italic"> son </hi> , who is giving the negroes all something."   
</p><p>I also read to them a new code of laws, which   
I had ordered   
to be put in force at Cornwall for the better security of  the    
negroes.  The principal were, that " a new hospital for the   
lying-in women, and for those who might be seriously ill, shuld   
be built, and made as comfortable as possible ; while the present   
one should be reserved for those whom the physicians might declare to be   
slightly indisposed, or   
not ill at all ;&mdash;the doors   
being kept constantly locked, and the sexes placed in separate   
chambers, to prevent its being made a place of amusement by    
the azy and the lying, as is the case at present."&mdash;" A book register   
of punishments to be kept, in which the name, offence, and nature   
and quantity of punishments inflicted must be carefully put down,   
and also a note of the same given to the negro, in order that, if   
he should think himself unjustly, or too severely punished, he   
may show his note to my other attorney on his next visit, ot to   
myslefon my return to Jamaica, and thus get redress if he has   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0139" n="122"/>
   
been wronged."-"No negro is to be struck or punished in any   
way without the trustee's express orders: the black driver so   
offending to be immediately degraded and sent to work in the   
field; and the white person, for such a breach of my orders, to    
be discharged upon the spot."-" No negro is to be punished    
till twenty-four hours shall have elapsed between his committing    
the fault and suffering for it, in order that nothing should be    
done in the heat of passion, but that the trustee should have time    
to consider the matter coolly. But to prevent a guilty person    
from avoiding punishment by running away, he is to pass those    
twenty-four hours in such confinement as the trustee may think    
most fitting."&mdash;" Any white person, who can be proved to have    
had an improper connection witb a woman known publicly to be    
living as the wife of one of my negroes, is to be discharged im-mediately upon complaint being made." I also gave the head    
driver a complete list of the allowances of clothing, food, &amp;c.,    
to which the negroes were entitled, in order that they might    
apply to it if they should have any doubts as to their having    
received their full proportion. My new rules seemed to add    
greatly to the satisfactionof the negroes, who were profuse in    
their expressions of gratitude.   
</p><p>  
The festival concluded with a grander ball than usual, as I    
sent for music from Savannah-la-Mar to play country-dances to    
them ; and at twelve o'clock at night. they left me apparently    
much pleased, only I heard them saying to each other, "When    
shall we have such a day of pleasure again, since massa goes to-morrow?"

as gaily as ever till the very moment of my departure ; but   
when , they saw my curricle actually at the door to convey me   
away, then their faces grew very long indeed. In particular,   
the women called me by every endearing name they could think   
of.  " My son! my love ! my husband ! my father !"   " You   
no my massa, you my tata!"  said one old woman ; and when I   
came down the steps to depart, they crowded about me, kissing   
my feet and clasping my knees, so that it was with difficulty   
that I cold get into the carriage.  And this was done with such

<p>At eight this morning we weighed anchor on our return to   
England.  The trade-winds, which facilitate the passage to Jamaica,  
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0141" n="124"/>
</p><p>   
   
effectually prevent the return of vessels by the same road.    
The common passage is through the Gulf of Florida, but there is    
another between Cuba and St. Domingo, which is at least 1000    
miles nearer. The first, however, affords almost a certainty of    
reaching Europe in a given time, while you may keep tacking    
in the attempt to make the windward passage (as it is called) for    
months together. Last pigbt, however, the wind was so favour-able for this attempt, that the captain determined upon risking    
it. Accordingly he altered his course; but had not done so for    
more than a few hours when the wind changed, and became as    
direct for the Gulf as till then it bad been contrary. The consequence was,   
that the Gulf passage   
was fixed once for all, and    
we are now steering towards it with all our might and main.   
Besides the distance saved there was another reason for preferring    
the windward passage, if  it could have been effected. The Gulf    
of Florida has for some time past been infested by a pirate called    
Captain Mitchell, who, by all accounts, seems to be a gentleman    
of the very worst description. It is not long ago since, in company with   
another vessel of his own   
stamp, he landed on the small   
settlement of St. Andrew's, plundered it completely, and on his   
departure carried off the governor, whom he kept on board, for    
more than fourteen days, and then hung him at the yard-arm   
out of mere wanton devilry. His companion has been captured    
and brought into Kingston, and the conquering vessel is gone in    
search of Captain Mitchell. If it does not fall in with him, and    
 <hi rend="italic"> we </hi>  do, I fear that we shall stand but a bad chance ; for he has    
one hundred men on board according to report, while we have   
 not above thirty. However, the captain has harangued them,    
represented the necessity of their fighting if attacked, as Captain    
Mitchell is known to spare no one, high or low, and has engaged.    
to give every man five guineas a-piece if a gun should be fired.,    
The sailors promise bravery; what their promises will prove we    
must leave to be decided by time and Captain Mitchell. In the    
meanwhile, every sail that appears on the horizon is concluded to   
be this terrible pirate, and everything is immediately put in readiness for   
action.

Atlantic, and bade farewell to the Gulf of Florida without having heard   
any news of the dreaded   
Commodore Mitchell. The   
narrow and dangerous part of the Gulf is about two hundred    
miles in length, and fifty in breadth, bordered on one side by the    
coast of Florida, and on the other, first by Cuba, and then by    
the Bahama Islands, of which the Manilla reef forms the ex-tremity, which reef also terminates the Gulf. But on both    
sides of these two hundred miles, at the distance of about four   
or five miles from the main-land, there extends a reef which    
renders the navigation extremely dangerous. This reef is broken   
at intervals by large inlets; and the sudden and violent squalls    
of wind to which the Gulf is subject, so frequently drive vessels   
into these perilous openings, that it is worth the while of many    
of the poorer inhabitants of Florida to establish their habitations    
within the reef, and devote themselves and their small vessels   
entirely to the occupation of assisting vessels in distress. They    
as known by the general name of " wreckers," and are allowed    
a certain salvage upon such ships as they may rescue. As a    
proof of the violence of the gales which are occasionally experienced in   
this gulf, our captain,   
about nine years ago, saw the   
wind suddenly take a vessel (which had unwisely suffered her    
canvass to stand, while the rest of the ships under convoy had    
taken theirs in) turn her completely over, the sails in the   
water and the keel uppermost. It happened about four o'clock    
in the afternoon the captain and the passengers were at dinner    
in the cabin ; but as she went over very leisurely, they and the    
crew had time allowed  them to escape out of the windows and   
port-holes, and sustain themselves upon the rigging, till boats    
from, the ships near them could arrive to take them off. As she   
filled, she gradually sunk, and in a quarter of an hour she had   
totally disappeared.

<p>Our Captain told me that, tow or three years ago, whilst his   
vessel eas lying in Black River, for the purpose of loading,   
a negro contrived to secrete himself in the lower part of it,   
where the sugar hogsheads are stored, unknown to anyone.  As   
soon as the carg was completed, the planks above it were   
caulked down, and raised no more till their ship reached Liverpool;

when, to the universal astonishment, upon opening the   
hold, out walked Mungo, in a wretched condition to be sure, but   
still at least alive, and a freeman in Great Britain. During his   
painful voyage he had subsisted entirely upon sugar, of which   
he had consumed nearly a hogshead; how he managed for water   
I could not learn, nor can imagine.

<p>Many years ago, a new species of grass was imported into    
Jamaica, by Mr. Vassal (to whom an estate near my own then    
belonged), as he said " for the purpose of feeding his pigs and    
his book-keepers"  Its seeds being soon scattered about by the    
birds, it has taken possession of the cane-pieces, whence to eradicate it is   
an utter impossibility,   
the roots being as strong as those    
of ginger, and insinuating themselves under ground to a great    
extent ; so that the only means of preventing it from entirely    
choking up the canes, is plucking it out with the hand, which is    
obliged to be done frequently, and has increased the labour of    
the plantation at least one third. This nuisance, which is called    
" Vassal's grass," from its original introducer, has now com-pletely overrun the parish of Westmoreland, has begun to show    
itself in the neighbouring parishes, and probably in time will    
get a footing throughout the island. St. Thomas's in the East    
has been inoculated with another self-inflicted plague, under the    
name of " the rifle-ant," which was imported for the purpose of    
eating up the ants of the country ; and so to be sure they did ,    
but into the bargain they eat up every thing else which came in    
their way, a practice in which they persist to this hour; so that    
it may be doubted whether in Jamaica most execrations are    
bestowed in the course of the day upon Vassal's grass, the rifleants, Sir   
Charles Price's rats, or the   
Reporter of the African   
 Society ; onl that the maledictions uttered against the first   
three are necessarily local, while the Reporter of the African'   
Society comes in for curses from all quarters.

A whole calendar month has elapsed since our quitting Jamaica, during   
which the wind has been   
favourable for somthing    
less than four-and-twenty hours; either it has blown precisely

from the point on which we wanted to sail, or has been so faint    
that we scarcely made one knot an hour. However, on Tuesday    
lot, finding ourselves in the latitude of  the " still-vexed Bermoothes," by   
way of variety, a   
sudden squall carried away both    
our lower stunsails in the morning; and at nine in the evening    
there came on a gale of wind truly tremendous. The ship    
pitched and rolled every minute, as if she had been on the point    
of overturning; the hen-coops floated about the deck, and many    
of the poultry were found drowned in them the next morning.    
Just as the last dead-light was being put up, the sea embraced the    
opportunity of the window being open, to whip itself through,    
and half filled the after-cabin with water; and in half an hour    
more a mountain of waves broke over the vessel, and pouring    
itself through the sky-light, paid the same compliment to the    
fore-cabin. About four in the morning the storm abated, and    
then we relapsed into our good old jog-trot pace of a knot an    
hour. Our passengers consist of a Mrs. Walker with her two    
children, and a sick surgeon of the name of Ashman.

<p>A negro song.&mdash;" Me take my cutacoo (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> a basket made of

man-O&mdash;My bonny man come home, come home ! Doctor no    
do you good. When neger fall into neger bands, buckra doctor    
no do him good more. Come home, my gold ring, come home ! "    
This is the song of a wife, whose husband had been Obeahed by    
another woman, in consequence of his rejecting her advances.   
  
</p><p> A negro riddle: " Pretty Miss Nancy was going to market,    
and she tore her fine yellow gown, and there was not a tailor in    
all the town who could mend it again."  This is a ripe plantain    
with a broken skin.   
  
</p><p>The negroes are also very fond of what they call Nancy stories,    
part of which is related, and part sung. The heroine of one of    
them is an old woman named Mamma Luna, who having left a    
pot boiling in her hut, found it robbed on her return. Her   
suspicions were divided between two children whom she found    
at play near her door, and some negroes who had passed that   
way to market. The children denied the theft positively. It was   
necessary for the negroes, in order to reach their own estate, to   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0145" n="128"/>
   
wade through a river at that time almost dry; and on their    
return, Mammy Luna (who, it should seem, was not without    
some skill in witchcraft) warned them to take care in venturing    
across the stream, for that the water would infallibly rise and    
carry away the person who had stolen the contents of her pot;    
but if the thief would but confess the offence, she engaged that    
no harm should happen, as she only wanted to exculpate the    
innocent, and not to punish the guilty. One and all denied the   
charge, and several crossed the river without fear or danger;   
but upon the approach of a  <hi rend="italic"> belly-woman  </hi> to the bank, she was   
observed to hesitate. " My neger, my neger," said Mammy    
Luria, " why you stop? me tink, you savee well, who thief me?   
This accusation spirited up the woman, who instantly marched    
into the river, singing as she went (and the woman's part is   
always chanted frequently in chorus, which the negroes pM   
taking up the sing ") -   
<q><lg><l>If da me cat Mammy Luna's pease-0,</l>   
<l>Drowny me water, drowny, drowny!"</l></lg></q>  
   
"My neger, my neger," cried the old woman, " me sure now   
you the thief ! me see the water wet you feet. Come back, my    
neger, come back." Still on went the woman, and still continued her song   
of   
   
<q><l>"If da me cat Mammy Luna's pease;" &amp;e,.</l></q>  
   
  
</p><p> My neger, my neger," repeated Mammy Luna, "me no   
want punish you ; my pot smell good, and you belly-woman.   
Come back, my neger, come back; me see now water above   
your knee! " But the woman was obstinate ; she continued to   
sing and to advance till she reached the middle of the river's   
bed, when down came a tremendous flood, swept her away, and   
she never was heard of more ; while Mammy Luna warned the   
other negroes never to take the property of another ; always to   
tell the truth; and, at least, if they should be betrayed into telling a lie, not   
to persist in it,   
otherwise they must expect to perish   
like their companion. Observe, that a moral is always an indispensable part   
of a Nancy-story.   
</p><p>  
Another is as follows:-" Two sisters had always lived together on the best   
terms; but, on the   
death of one of them, the   
other treated very harshly a little niece who had been left to her   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0146" n="129"/>
   
care, and made her a common drudge to herself and her daughter. One day   
the child, having   
broken a water-jug, was turned   
out of the house, and ordered not to return till she could bring    
back a good one. As she was going along weeping, she came   
to a large cotton-tree, under which was sitting an old woman    
without a head. I suppose this unexpected sight made her gaze    
rather too earnestly, for the old woman immediately inquired,   
' Well, my piccaniny, what you see? Oh, mammy,' answered    
the girl, ' me no see nothing.'   ' Good child!' said again the    
old woman, ' and good will come to you.' Not far distant was    
a cocoa-tree, and here was another old woman, without any more    
head than the former one. The same question was asked her,   
and she failed not to give the same answer which had already   
met with so good a reception.   
</p><p>" Still she travelled forwards, and began to feel faint through    
want of food; when, under a mahogany-tree, she not only saw a    
third old woman, but one who, to her great satisfaction, had got    
a head between her shoulders. She stopped and made her best    
courtesy, ' How day, grannie!' ' How day, my piccaniny ; what    
matter? you no look well.' , ' Grannie, me lilly hungry.' ' My    
piccanny, you see that hut, there's rice in the pot, take it, and    
yam-yamme ; but if you see one black puss, mind you give him    
him share.'   
</p><p>  
"The child hastened to profit by the permission the ' one   
black puss' failed not to make its appearance, and was served first   
to its portion of rice, after which it departed ; and the child had   
but just finished her meal when the mistress of the hut entered,   
and told her that she might help herself to three eggs out of the   
fowl-house, but that she must not take any of the  <hi rend="italic"> talking ones </hi>  :    
perhaps, too, she might find the black puss there also; but if she   
did,  she was to take no notice of her.  Unluckily all the eggs   
seemed to be as fond of talking as if they had been so many old   
</p>   
<p>maids, and the moment that the child entered the fowl-house   
there was a cry of ' Take  <hi rend="italic"> me!  </hi> Take  <hi rend="italic"> me!'  </hi> from all quarters.   
However, she was punctual in her obedience; and although the    
conversable eggs were remarkably fine and large, she searched   
about till at length she bad collected three little dirty-looking   
eggs that had not a word to say for themselves.   
</p><p>"The old woman now dismissed her guest, bidding her to   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0147" n="130"/>
   
return home without fear ; but not to forget to break one of the    
eggs under each of the three trees near which she had seen an    
old woman that morning. The first egg produced a water-jug    
exactly similar to that which she had broken ; out of the second    
came a whole large sugar-estate; and out of the third a splendid    
equipage, in which she returned to her aunt, delivered up the    
jug, related that an old woman in a red docker (i. e. pettiecoat)    
had made her a great lady, and then departed in triumph to her    
sugar-estate.   
</p><p> "Stung by envy, the aunt lost no time in sending her own    
daughter to search for the same good fortune which had befallen    
her cousin. She found the cotton-tree and the headless old    
woman, and had the same question addressed to her ; but instead    
of returning the same answer-' What me see? ' said she ; ' me    
see one old woman without him head!' Now this reply was    
doubly offensive: it was rude, because it reminded the old lady    
of what might certainly be considered as a personal defect; and    
it was dangerous, as, if such a circumstance were to come to the    
ears of the buckras, it might bring her into trouble, women being    
seldom known to walk and talk without their heads, if ever,    
except by the assistance of Obeah. ' Bad child ! cried the old    
woman; ' bad child ! and bad will come to you!'   
</p><p> "Matters were no better managed near the cocoa-tree ; and    
even when she reached the mahogany, although she saw that the    
old woman had not only got her head on, but had a red docker    
besides, she could not prevail on herself to say more than a short    
' How day ? ' without calling her ' grannie.' However, she received the   
permission to eat rice at   
the cottage, coupled with    
the injunction of giving a share to the black puss ; an injunction,    
however, which she totally disregarded, although she scrupled    
not to assure her hostess that she had suffered puss to eat till she    
could eat no more. The old lady in the red petticoat seemed to    
swallow the lie very glibly, and dispatched the girl to the fowlhouse for   
three eggs, as she had   
before done her cousin ; but   
having been cautioned against taking the talking eggs, she conceived that   
these must needs be the   
most valuable, and therefore   
made a point of selecting those three which seemed to be the   
greatest gossips.  Then, lest their chattering should betray her   
disobedience, she thought it best not to return into the hut, and   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0148" n="131"/>
   
acccordingly set forward on her return home; but she had not    
yet reached the mahogany-tree when curiosity induced her to    
break one of the eggs. To her infinite disappointment it proved    
to be empty; and she soon found cause to wish that the second   
had been empty too : for, on her dashing it against the ground,    
out came an enormous yellow snake, which flew at her with    
dreadful hissings. Away ran the girl; a fallen bamboo lay in    
her path ; she stumbled over it and fell. In her fall the third    
egg was broken; and the old woman without the head immediately   
popping out of it, told her,   
that if she had treated her as   
civilly as her cousin had done, she would have obtained the same   
good fortune; but that as she had shown her nothing but rude-ness, she must be contented to carry nothing home but the empty    
egg-shells. The old woman then jumped upon the yellow snake,    
galloped away with incredible speed, and never showed her red    
docker in that part of the island anymore."

<p>At breakfast the captain was explaining to me   
the dangerous    
consequences of breaking the wheel-rope: two hours afterwards    
the wheel-rope broke, and round swung the vessel. However,

<p>A gale of wind began to show itself on Monday night; it has   
continued to blow ever since with increasing violence, and is   
now become very serious.  The captain says that he never experienced   
weather so severe at this   
season : this is only my usual   
luck. Certainly nothing can be more disagreeable than a ship   
on these occasions.  The sea breaks over the vessel every minute,   
and it is really something awful to see the waves raised into the   
air by the force of the gale, hovering for a while over the ship,   
and then coming down upon us swop, to inundate everything   
below deck as well as upon it. The wind is piercingly cold ;   
the floors and walls are perpetually streaming. But a fire is quite    
out of the question; and, indeed, at one time to-day our eating   
appeared out of the question too ; for at four o'clock the   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0149" n="132"/>
   
cook sent us word that the sea put the kitchen fire out as fast    
as he could light it ; that he was almost frozen, having been for    
the last eight hours up to his waist in water, and that we must    
make up our minds to get no dinner to-day. However, the    
steward coaxed him and encouraged him, and poured spirits    
down his throat, and at last a dinner of some kind was put upon    
the table ; but it had not been there ten minutes before a tremendous sea   
poured itself down the   
companion-stairs and through    
the hatchway, set everything on the table afloat, deluged the    
cabin, ducked most of the company, and drove us all into the    
other room. I was lucky enough to escape with only a sprink-ling. We can only cross the cabin by creeping along by the   
sides as if we were so many cats. Walking the deck, even for   
the sailors, is absolutely out of the question ; and the little cabinboy has so   
fairly given up the   
attempt, that he goes crawling    
about upon all fours. Even our Spanish mastiff, Flora, finds it    
impossible to keep her four legs upon deck. Every five minutes    
up they all go, away rolls the dog over and over, and when she    
gets up again shakes her ears, and howls in a tone of the most    
piteous astonishment.

<p>Though the gale was itself sufficiently serious, its effects at    
first were ludicrous enough ; but yesterday it produced a conse-quence truly shocking and alarming. Edward Sadler, the second    
mate, was at breakfast in the steerage : the boatswain had been    
cutting some beef with a large case-knife, which he had afterput down   
upon the chest on which   
they were sitting; a sudden    
heel of the ship threw them all to the other side of the cabin;    
the knife fell with its haft against the ladder; and poor Edward    
falling against it, at least three inches of the blade were forced    
into his right side. The wound was dressed without the loss of   
a moment : but from its depth, the jaggedness of the weapon   
with which it was made, and from a pain which immediately   
afterwards seized the poor fellow in his chest, the apothecary   
thinks that his recovery is very improbable : he says that he   
liver is certainly perforated, and so probably are the lungs.  If   
the latter have exscaped, it must have been only by the breadth   
of a hair.  every one in the ship is distressed beyond measure

a this accident, for the young man is a universal favourite. He   
is but just one-and-twenty, good-looking, with manners much    
superior to his station, and so unusually steady as well as active,   
that if Providence grants him life he cannot fail to, raise himself   
in his profession.

<p>Edward complains no longer of the pain in his chest; be   
sleeps well, eats enough, has no fever, and every symptom is so   
favourable, that Dr. Ashman encourages us to hope that he has   
received no material injury. Our ship-carpenter has always   
appeared to be the sulkiest and surliest of sea-bears: yet on the   
day of Edward's accident he passed every minute that he could   
command by the side of his sofa, kneeling and praying, and   
watching him as if he had been his son, and every now and then   
wiping away his " own tears " with the dirtiest of all possible   
pocket-bandkerchiefs. So that what Goldsmith said of Dr. Johnson may be   
applied to this   
old,man&mdash;" He has nothing of a bear   
but his skin." After tearing every sail in the ship into shivers,   
and being as disagreeable as ever it could be, the gale has at   
length abated. Yesterday it was a storm, and we were going to   
Ireland, Lisbon, Brest&mdash;in short, everywhere except to England;   
to-day it is a dead calm, and we are going nowhere at all.

<p>The wounded mate is so much recovered as to come upon deck    
for a few hours to-day, and may now be considered as completely-out of danger; although Dr. Ashman is positive (from his difficulty of   
breathing at first, and the   
subsequent pain in his chest)   
that his lungs must actually have been wounded, however slightly.

But the creole slavess are

provision-grounds into two parts, and proposed that each of the    
women should cultivate one half.   They were ready to do their    
proper share, but insisted that the husband should at least take    
his third of the work. However, when they were to set out, the    
man was taken so ill that he found it impossible to move ; he    
quite roared with pain, and complained bitterly of a large lump    
which bad formed itself on his cheek during the night. The    
wives did what they could to relieve him, but in vain: they    
boiled a negro-pot for him, but he was too ill to swallow a morsel ; and at   
length they were   
obliged to leave him, and go to    
take care of the provision-grounds. As soon as they were gone    
the husband became perfectly well, emptied the contents of the    
pot with great appetite, and enjoyed himself in ease and indolence till   
evening, when he saw his   
wives returning, and immediately he became worse than ever. One of the   
women was    
quite shocked to see the size to which the lump had increased    
during her absence : she begged to examine it ; but although    
she barely touched it with the tip of her finger as gingerly as    
possible, it was so tender that the fellow screamed with agony.    
Unluckily, the other woman's manners were by no means so delicate; and   
seizing him forcibly by   
the head to examine it, she    
undesignedly happened to hit him a great knock on the jaw, and    
lo and behold! out flew a large lime which he had crammed    
into it.  Upon which both his wives fell upon him like two    
furies ; beat him out of the house; and whenever afterwards he   
begged them to go to the provision-grounds, they told him that    
he had got no lime in his mouth  <hi rend="italic"> then </hi> , and obliged him from that    
time forwards to do the whole work himself."

<p>We once more saw the " Lizard," and indeed was full time    
that we should. Besides that our provisions were nearly exhausted by the   
length of the voyage,   
our crew was in a great    
measure composed of fellows of the most worthless description ;    
and the captain lately discovered that some of them had contrived to break   
a secret passage into   
the hold, where they had

broached the rum-casks, and had already passed several nights

been sufficient to blow us all up to the moon!

We took our river-pilot on board ; and on Wednesday the

I  LEFT London, and again embarked for Jamaica on board the   
same vessel which conveyed me thither in 1815, and with the   
same captain also. When we weighed our anchor at Gravesend,   
before it could be got on board the cable slipped, and down again   
went the anchor, carrying along with it one of the men who happened to be   
standing upon it at   
the moment, and who in conse-quence went plump to the bottom. Luckily the fellow could   
swim ; so in a few minutes he was on board again, and no harm   
done.  W did not reach the Downs till Sunday the 9th, after   
experiencing in our passage a severe gale of wind, which broke   
the bowsprit of a vessel in our sight, but did us no mischief.   
On arriving in the Downs we found all the flags flying halfmast high,   
which is a signal of   
mourning; and we learnt that in   
a few hours after giving birth to a still-born son, the Princess   
Charlotte</p>   
<p> of  Wales had expired at half-past two on Thursday   
morning.

passage, and the dread of a gale would not admit of our remaining in so   
dangerous a roadstead.   
So we had nothing for it but    
to " return to the place whence we came." We are now anchored    
upon the Motherbank, about two miles from Ryde.

<p>I had often heard talk of " a hell upon earth," and now I have    
a perfect idea of " a hell upon water." It must be precisely our    
vessel during the last three weeks. On the 3rd we left the Motherbank, and   
on the 4th we passed   
Plymouth, and were actually    
in sight of the Lizard point,, when the wind suddenly became    
completely foul, and drove us back into the Channel. It continued to   
strengthen, and by the time   
that night arrived, we had    
a violent gale, which blew incessantly till the middle of Sunday,    
the 7th, when we were glad to find ourselves once more in sight    
of Plymoutb, and took advantage of a temporary abatement of    
the wind to seek refuge in the Sound. Here, however, we soon    
found that we had but little reason to rejoice at the change of    
our situation. The Sound was already crowded with vessels of    
all descriptions; and as we arrived so late, the only mooring    
still unoccupied placed us so near the rocks on one side, and    
another vessel astern, that the captain confessed that he should    
feet considerable anxiety if the gale should return with its former    
violence. So of course, about eleven at night, the gale  <hi rend="italic"> did  </hi> return;   
not, indeed, with its former   
violence, but increased tenfold ; and once we were in very imminent   
danger from our    
ship's swinging round by a sudden squall, and narrowly escaping    
coming in contact with the ship astern, which bad not, it seems,    
allowed itself sufficient cable. Luckily we just missed her ; and    
our cables (for both our anchors were down) being new and    
good, we rode out the storm without driving or meeting with any    
accident whatever. The next day was squally ; and in spite of    
the Breakwater, the rocking of the ship from the violent agitation of the   
waves by the late stormy   
weather was almost insup-portable.  However, on the 9<hi rend="super">th</hi> the wind took a more   
favourable    
turn, though in so slight a degree that the pilot expressed great   
doubts whether it would last long enough to do us any service.   
But the captain felt his situation in Plymouth Sound do uneasy,   
that he resolved at least to make the attempt, and so we crept   
   
   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0154" n="137"/>
   
once more into the Channel.  In a few hours the breeze   
strengthened ; about midnight we passed the lights upon the   
Lizard, and the next morning England was at length out of   
sight.   This cessation of ill-luck proved to be only  "  <hi rend="italic"> reculer </hi>    
 <hi rend="italic"> pour mieux sauter </hi> ."  The gale, it seems, had only stopped to   
take a breath : about four in the afternoon of Wednesday the wind   
began to rise again ; and from that time till the middle of the   
23<hi rend="super">rd</hi> it blew a complete storm day and night, with only an   
occasional intermission of two or three   
hours at a time.  Every one   
in the ship declared that they had never before experienced so   
obstinate a persecution of severe weather : every rag of sail eas    
obliged to be taken down ; the sea was blown up into mountains,    
and poured itslef over the deck repeatedly.  The noise was   
dreadful ; and as it lasted incessantly, to sleep was impossible ;    
and I passed ten nights, one after another, without closing my    
eyes ; so that the pain in the nerves of them at length became   
almost intolerable, and I began to be seriously afraid of going    
blind.  In truth, the captain could not well have pitched upon a   
set of passenger worse calculated to undergo the trial of a   
passage so rough.  As for myslef, the my brain is so weak, that the   
continuation of any violent noise makes me absolutley lightheaded ; and a   
pop-guun going off   
suddenly is quite sufficient at   
any time to set every nerve shaking, from the crown of my head   
to the sole of my foot.  The we had a young lady who was   
ready to die of sea-sickness, and an old one who was a lillte better   
through fright ; and I had an Italian servant who was as sick as   
the young lady, and as much frightenend as the old one.  The   
poor fellow had never been really  <hi rend="italic"> out at sea before </hi>  ; and with   
every crack whcich the vessel gave, he thought that to be sure she   
was splitting right in half.  The sailors too were quite knocked   
up from the unremitting fatigue to which they were subjected by   
the continuance of this dreadful weather.  Several of them were   
ill ; and one poor fellow actually died and wsa committed to the   
ocean.  Tyo make matters still worse, during the first week the   
wind was as fould as it could blow ; and we did nothing but run   
backwards and forwards, without advancing a step towards our   
object ; till at length every particle of my very small stock of   
patience eas exhausted, and I could no longer resist suggesting    
out return to port, rather than continue buffeting about in   
  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0155" n="138"/>
   
the chops of the Channel, so much to the damage of the ship and   
all contained in her. A change of wind, however, gave a complete   
answer to this proposal. On Thursday it became favourable as to the   
prosecution of our   
voyage, but its fury continued   
unabated till the evening of the 23rd.  It then gradually died   
away, and left us becalmed before the island of Madeira, where   
we are now rolling backwards and forwards in sight of its capital,   
Funchal, on the 24th of December, being seven weary weeks   
since our departure from Gravesend. The evenin, sun is now   
very brilliant, and shines full upon the island, the rocks of which   
are finely broken. The height of the mountains cause their tops   
to be lost in the clouds ; the sides are covered with plantations   
of vines and forests of cedars; and the white edifices of Funchal,it   
built upon the very edge of the shore, have a very picturesque   
appearance. We are now riding between the island and an iso-.   
lated group of inaccessible rocks called " the Deserters;" and,   
the effect of the scene altogether is beautiful in the extreme.

of " the Horse Latitudes." During the union of America and    
Great Britain, great numbers of' horses used to be exported to   
the cQjonies, and the winds in these latitudes are so capricious,    
squally, and troublesome-now a gale and then a dead calm,    
now a fair wind and the next moment a foul one-that more   
horses used to die in this portion of the passage than during all    
the remainder of it. These horse-killing latitudes extend from,

<p>On Saturday, the 3<hi rend="super">rd</hi>, we managed to crawl over the   
line,   
and had no sooner got to the other side of it, than we were completely   
becalmed ; and even when   
we were able to resume our   
progress, it was at such a pace that a careless observer might   
have been pardoned foe mistaking our manner of moving for a   
downright standstill.  Day after day produced nothing better   
for us than baffling winds, so light that we scarcely made tow   
miles and hour, and so variable that the sails could be scarcely set   
in one direction before it became necessay to shift them to another;

while the monotony of our voyage was only broken by   
an occasional thunder-storm, the catching of stray dolphin now   
and then, watching a shoal of flying-fish, or guessing at the complexion of   
the corsairs on board   
some vessel in the offing : for   
the Caribbean Sea is now dabbed all over like apainter's pallette with   
corsairs of all colours,&mdash;black from St. Domingo,   
brown from Carthagena, white from North America, and peagreen from   
the Cape de Verd   
Islands.  On the afternoon of the    
4th, one of them was no very great distance from us ; she   
hoisted English colours on seeing ours ; but there was little    
doubt, from her peculiar appearance, that she was aprivateer   
from Carthagena.  She set her head towards us, and seemed to   
be doing her best to come to a nearer aquaintance ; but the   
same calm which hindered us from bravely running away from   
her, hindered her also from reaching us, although at nightfall   
she seemed to have gained upon us.  In the night we had a violent   
thunder-storm, and the next   
morning she was not to be  seen.   
Still we continued to creep and to crawl, grumbling and growling, till on   
Sunday, the 11<hi rend="super">th</hi>, the   
long-looked-for breeze came at    
last.  The trade-wind began to blow with all its might and main   
right in the vessel's poop, and sent us forward at a rate of 200   
miles a -day.  We passed between Deseada and Antigua in the   
night of the 15th ; and, on the 16th, the rising sun showed us   
the island-mountain of Montserrat ; the sight of which was    
scarcley less agreeable to our eyes from its romantic beauty,   
than welcome from its giving us the assurance that out longwinded voyage   
is at length drawing   
towards its termination.

bait laid for dolphins, and in consequence soon made his appearance upon   
deck. It was a very   
young one, not above three feet   
long.  I ordered a slice of him to be broiled at dinner, but he   
was ny no means so good as a dolphin ; still there was nothing   
in the taste so palatable as to prevent the flesh from being

he was suffered to escape this morning. It was beautifully

comparison with the smallness of the body, a long sharp bill,    
black and polished like a piece of jet, and eyes remarkably large   
and brilliant.  The head, back, and outside of the wings were   
of a brownish slate-colour, and the rest of his feathers of the   
most dazzling whiteness.  It is called a crab-catcher.

<p>Our favourable breeze lasted till Tuesday, the 20th; when,    
having brought us balf-way between St. Domingo and Jamaica    
it died away, and we dragged on at the rate of two or three    
miles an hour till Thursday afternoon, which placed us at the    
mouth of Black River. If we had arrived one hour earlier, we    
could have immediately entered the harbour; but, with our    
usual good fortune, we were just too late for the daylight. We    
therefore did not drop anchor till two o'clock on Friday, before    
the town of Black River; and on Saturday morning, at four    
o'clock, I embarked in the ship's cutter for Savannah la Mar.   
Every one assured us that we could not fail to have a favourable    
sea-breeze the whole way, and that we should be on land by    
eight: instead of which what little wind there was veered round    
from one point of the compass to the other with the most indefatigable   
caprice; and we were not   
on shore till eleven. Here    
I found Mr. T. Hill, who luckily had his phaeton ready, in    
which he conveyed me once more to Cornwall. The accounts    
of the general behaviour of my negroes are tolerably good, and    
they all express themselves satisfied with their situation and their    
superintendents. Yet, among upwards of three hundred and    
thirty negroes, and with a greater number of females than men,    
in spite of all indulgences and inducements, not more than twelve    
or thirteen children have been added annually to the list of the    
births. On the other hand, this last season has been generally    
unhealthy all over the island, and more particularly so in my    
parish; so that I have lost several negroes, some of them young,    
strong, and valuable labourers in every respect; and in consequence, my   
muster-roll is rather   
diminished than increased since    
my last visit. I had been so positively assured that the custom    
of plunging negro-infants, immediately upon their being born,   
   
   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0158" n="141"/>
   
into a tub of cold wate, infallibly preserved them from the    
danger of tetanus, that on leaving Jaiaca, I had ordered this   
practice to be adopted uniformly.  The negro mothers, however,   
took a prejudice against it, and have been so obstinate in their opposition,   
that it was thought   
unadviseable to attempt the enforcing   
this regulation.  from this and other causes I have lost several   
infants ; but I am told, that on other estates in the neighbourhood they have   
been still more   
unfortunate in regard to their   
children ; and one was named to me, on which sixteen were   
carried off in the ocurse of three days.

<p>The joy of the negroes on my return was quite sufficiently   
voiciferous, and they were allowed to-day for a holiday. They   
set themselves to singing and dancing yesterday, in order to   
lose no time; and to show their gratitude for the indulgence, not   
one of the five pen-keepers chose to go to their watch last night ;   
the consequence was, that the cattle made their escape, and got   
into one of my very best cane-pieces. The alarm was given; my   
own servants and some of the head people had grace enough to   
run down to the scene of action ; but the greatest part remained   
quietly in the negro-houses, beating the gumby-drum, and sing-ing their joy for my arrival with the whole strength of their   
lungs, but without thinking it in the least necessary to move so   
much as a finger-joint in my service.</p>   
<p>The cattle were at length   
replaced in their pen, but not till the cane-piece had been ruined   
irretrievably.</p>   
<p>  Such is negro gratitude, and such my reward for   
all that I have suffered on ship-board.</p>

<l>"Take him to the Gulley! Take biui to the Gulley!"</l>   
<l>"Carry him along !"</l></lg></q>   
   
This alludes to a transaction which took place some thirty    
years ago, on an estate in this neighbourhood, called Spring   
  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0159" n="142"/>
   
Garden; the owner of which (I think the name was Bedward)   
is quoted as the cruellest proprietor that ever disgraced Jamaica.   
It was his constant practice, whenever a sick negro was pro-nounced incurable, to order the poor wretch to be carried to a   
solitary vale upon his estate, called the Gulley, where he was    
thrown down and abandoned to his fate&mdash;which fate was generally to be   
half-devoured by the   
John-crows before death had    
put an end to his sufferings. By this proceeding the avaricious    
owner avoided the expense of maintaining the slave during his    
last illness ; and, in order that he might be as little a loser as    
possible, be always enjoined the negro bearers of the dying man    
to strip him naked before leaving the Gulley, and not to forget    
to bring back his frock and the board on which he had been    
carried down. One poor creature, while in the act of being    
removed, screamed out most piteously "that he was not dead    
yet;" and implored not to be left to perish in the Gulley in a    
manner so horrible. His cries had no effect upon his master,    
but operated so forcibly on the less marble hearts of his fellowslaves, that   
in the night some of   
them removed him back to the    
negro-village privately, and nursed him there with so much care    
that he recovered, and left the estate unquestioned and undiscovered.   
Unluckily, one day the   
master was passing through    
Kingston, when, on turning the corner of a street suddenly, he    
found himself face to face with the negro whom he had supposed    
long ago to have been picked to the bones in the Gulley. He    
immediately seized him, claimed him as his slave, and ordered    
his attendants to convey him to his house ; but the fellow's cries    
attracted a crowd round them before he could be dragged away :    
be related his melancholy story, and the singular manner in    
which he had recovered his life and liberty; and the public indignation was   
so forcibly excited by   
the shocking tale, that Mr.    
Bedward was glad to save himself from being torn to pieces by    
a precipitate retreat from Kingston, and never ventured to advance his   
claim to the negro a   
second time.

A man has been tried at Kingston for cruel treatment of a   
Sambo female slave, called Amey. She dad no friends to support   
her cause, nor any other evidence tp prove her assertions than the   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0160" n="143"/>
   
apparent truth of her statement, and the marks of having been   
branded in five different places.  The result was, that the master   
received a most severe reprimand for his inhuman conduct, and   
wassentenced to close confinement for six months ; while the   
slave, in consequence of her suffereings, was restored to the full   
enjoyment  of her freedom.   
</p><p> It appears to me that nothing could afford so much relief to   
the negroes, under the existing system, as the substituting the   
labour of animals for that of slaves in agriculture, wherever such   
a measure is practicable.  On leaving the island I impressed this   
wish of mine upon the minds of my agents with all my power ;   
but the result has been the creating of a very considerable   
additional expense in the purchase of ploughs, oxen, and farming   
implements : the awkwardness, and still more the obstinancy, of   
the few negroes whose services were indispensible, was not to be   
overcome ; they broke plough after plough, and ruined beast    
after beast, till the attempy was abandoned in despair.  However, it was   
made without the most   
essential ingrediaent for success&mdash;the superintendence of an English   
ploughman : and such   
of the ploughs as were cast-iron could not be repaired when   
once broken, and therefore ought not to have been adopted ; but   
I am told that in several other parts of the island the plough has   
been introduced, and completely successful.   
</p><p>  
Another of my farming speculations answered no better : this   
was to improve the breed of cattle in the country, for which   
purpose Lord Holland and myself sent over four of the finest    
bulls that could be procurredin England.  One of them got a    
trifling hurt in his passage from the vessel to the land ; but the   
remaining three were deposited in their respective pens without   
the least apparent damage.  They were taken all possible care   
of&mdash;houses approriated to shelter them from sun and rain&mdash;   
and, in short, no means of preserving their health was neglected.   
Yet, shortly after their arrival in Jamaica, they evidently began   
to decline; they paid no sort of attention to the cows who were   
confined in the same paddock ; and at the end of a fortnight they   
were all dead.  The injured one, having been bled the most copiously in   
consequence of his hurt,   
was that which survived the   
longest.

of a negro belonging to Greenwich estate, named Aberdeen, who    
had run away repeatedly, but who attributed his misconduct to    
the decay of his health, which rendered him unable to work as    
well as formerly, and to the fear of consequent punishment for    
not having performed the tasks assigned to him. The fellow    
while be spoke to me had tears running down his abeeks, looked    
feeble and ill, and indeed seemed to be quite heart-broken. On    
my speaking to the attorney, he readily promised to inquire into    
the truth of the man's statement, and to take care that he should    
be only allotted such labour as his strength might be fully equal    
to. This morning he came over to see me, and so altered that I    
could scarcely believe him to be the same man. He was cleanly    
dressed, walked with his head erect, and his eyes sparkled, and    
his mouth grinned from ear to ear, while he told me that during    
my absence everything had gone well with him, nobody had    
" put upon him;" he had been tasked no more than suited his    
strength ; as much as he was able to do, he had done willingly,    
and had never run away. Even his asthma was better in consequence of the   
depression being   
rdmoved from his spirits. So, he    
said, as soon as he heard of my return, be thought it his duty to    
come over and show himself to me, and tell me that he was well,   
and contented, and behaving properly ; for that " to be sure, if    
massa no speak that good word for me to trustee, me no livee    
now; me good massa ! " Gratitude made him absolutely eloquent: his   
whole manner, and the   
strong expression of his countenance, put his sincerity out of all doubt, and   
I never saw a    
man seem to feel more truly thankful. All negroes, therefore,   
are not absolutely without some remembrance of kindness shown   
them; and indeed I ought not, in justice to my own people, to   
allow myself to forget that, when I sent a reward to those who    
had roused themselves to drive the cattle out of the canes the    
other night, there was considerable difficulty in persuading them    
to accept the money: they sent me word, " that as they were    
all well treated on the estate, it was their business to take care    
that no mischief was done to it, and that they did not deserve to    
be rewarded for having merely done their duty by me."

<p>One of the deadliest poisons used by the negroes (and a great    
variety is perfectly well known to most of them) is prepared    
from the root of the cassava. Its juice being expressed and    
allowed to ferment, a small worm is generated, the substance of    
which being received into the stomach is of a nature the most    
pernicious. A small portion of this worm is concealed under    
one of the thumb-nails, which are suffered to grow long for this    
purpose ; then, when the negro has contrived to persuade his intended   
victim to eat or drink with   
him, he takes an opportunity,    
while handing to him a dish or cup, to let the worm fall, which    
never fails to destroy the person who swallows it. Another    
means of destruction is to be found (as I am assured) in almost    
every negro-garden throughout the island: it is the arsenic-bean,    
neither useful for food nor ornamental in its appearance ; nor    
can the negroes, when questioned, give any reason for affording    
it a place in their gardens ; yet there it is always to be seen.    
The alligator's liver also possesses deleterious properties; and    
the gall is said to be still more dangerous.

<p>Whether it be the climate not agreeing with their African    
blood (genuine or inherited), or whether it be from some defect    
in their general formation, certainly negroes seem to hold their    
lives upon a very precarious tenure. Some of my strongest    
workmen, the very servants too in my own house, are perpetually falling   
ill with little fevers, or   
colds, or pains in the head or    
limbs.  However, the season is universally allowed to have been    
peculiarly unhealthy for negroes; and, indeed, even for white    
people, the deaths on board the shipping having been unusually    
numerous this year; and in the barracks, which are scarcely a    
couple of miles distant front my estate, the yellow fever has established   
itself, and, as I hear, is   
committing terrible ravages,    
particularly among the wives of the soldiers. This morning    
several negro mothers, belonging to Friendship and Greenwich,    
came to complain to their attorney (who happened to be at my    
house) that the overseer obliged them to wean their children too    
soon. Some-of these children were above twenty-two months   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0163" n="146"/>
   
old, and none under eighteen ; but, in order to retain the leisure    
and other indulgences annexed to the condition of nursingmothers, the   
female negroes, by their   
own good-will, would    
never wean their offspring at all. Of course their demanas were    
rejected, and they went home in high discontent; one of them,    
indeed, Dot scrupling to declare aloud, and with a peculiar    
emphasis and manner, that if the child should be put into the    
weaning-house against her will, the attorney would see it dead in    
less than a week.

<p>The violent gale of wind which persecuted us with so much    
pertinacity on our leaving the English Channel is supposed to    
have been the tail of a tremendous hurricane which has utterly    
laid waste Barbadoes and several other islands. No less than    
sixteen of the ships which sailed at the same time with us are   
reported to have perished upon the passage ; so that I ought to    
consider it at least as a negative piece of good luck to have   
reached Jamaica myself, " no bones broke, though sore peppered ;" but I   
am still trembling in   
uncertainty for the fate of    
the vessel which is bringing out all my Irish supplies, and the    
non-arrival of which would be a misfortune to me of serious    
magnitude. The negroes are so obstinate and so wilful in their    
general character, that if they do not receive the precise articles    
to which they have been accustomed, and which they expect as   
their right, no compensation, however ample, can satisfy them.    
Thus, at every Christmas it would go near to create a rebellion    
if they did not receive a certain proportion of salt fish ; but if,   
in the interveneing months, accident should prevent their receiving   
their usual allownace of herrings, the giving them salt fish,   
although double the value, would be considered by them as   
an act of the grossest injustice.

<p>On Saturday about eight in the evening a large centipede   
dropped from the ceiling upon my dinner-table, and was immediatley cut   
in tw exact halves by   
one of the guests.  As it isa   
reported in Jamaica that these reptiles when thus divided will   
re-unite again, or if separated will reproduce their missing members,  
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0164" n="147"/>
   
and continue to live as stoutly as ever, I put both parts   
into a plate, under a glass cover. On Sunday they continued to   
about their prison with considerable agility, although the   
tail was evidently much more lively and full of motion than the   
head.  On Monday the head was dead, but the tail continued to   
run about,  and evidently endeavoured to make its escape, although   
it appeared not to know very well how to set about it, nor to be   
perfectly determined as to which way it wanted to go. On   
Wednesday at twelve o'clock its vivacity was a little abated, but   
only a little : the wound was skinned over, and I was waiting   
anxiously to know whether it would subsist without its numskull    
till a good old age, or would put forth an entirely spick and span    
new head and shoulders, when on going to look at the plate on    
Thursday morning, lo and behold ! the dead head and the living    
tail had diappeared together. I suppose some of the negro   
servants had thrown them away through ignorance, but they one    
and all most stoutly deny having so much as toricbed the plate ;    
and as a paper case pierced in several places had been substituted    
for the glass cover, some persons are of opinion that the tail    
made its escape through one of these air-holes, and carried its    
head away with it in its forceps. Be this as it may, gone they    
both are, and I am disappointed beyond measure. I have proclaimed    
a reward for the bringing me   
another; but I am told that these reptiles are only found by accident.

<p>Mr. Lutford, the proprietor of a considerable estate in the   
parish if Clarendon, had frequently accused a particular negro  
of purloining coffee.  About six months ago the slave was sent   
for, and charged with a fresh offence of the same nature, when   
he confessed having taken a small quantity ; upon which his   
master ordered him to fix his eyes on a particular cotton-tree,   
and then, without any further ceremony, shot him through the   
head.  His mistress ws the coroners' natural daughter, and the   
coroner himself was similarly connected with the custos of Clarendon.  In   
consequence of this   
family compact no inquest was   
held, no inquiry was made ; the whole business was allowed to   
be slurred over, and the murder would have remained unpunished   
if accident had not brought some rumours respecting it to the   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0165" n="148"/>
   
governor's ear.  An investigation was ordered to take place   
without delay,  but MR. Lutford received sufficient warning to   
get on ship-board, and escape to America ; and the displacing of   
the custos of Clarendon for neglecting his official duty was the   
only means by which the governor could express his abhorrence   
of the act.

<p>My estate is greatly palgued by a negress named Catalina ;   
she is either mad or has long pretended to be so : never works,   
and always steals.  About a week befor emy arrival she was   
found in the trash-house, which ahe had pitched upon as the very   
fittest place possible for her kitchen ; and there she was sitting,   
very quietly and comfortably, boiling her pot over an immense   
fire,  and surrounded on all sides by dry canes, inlfammable as   
tinder.  This vagary was of too dangerous a nature to allow of   
her being linger left in liberty, and she was put into the hospital.  But her   
husband was by no   
means pleased with her detentin, as he never failed to appropriate to   
himself a share of    
her plunder, and when discovered the blame of the robbery was   
laid upon his wife's insanity.  So, while the general joy at my    
first arrival drew the hospital attendants from their post, he took   
the opportunity to carry off his wife and conceal her.  The consequence   
was , that this morning   
complaints poured upon me of   
gardens robbed by Catalina, who had carried off as much as she   
could, dug up and destroyed the rest, and had shown as little   
conscience in providing herself with poultry as in helping herself   
to vegetables.  I immediately despatched on of the negro-govenors with a   
party in pursuit of her,   
who succeeded in lodging    
her once more in the hospital, where she must remain till I can   
get her sent to the asylum at Kingston, the only hospital for   
lunatics in the whole island.

<p>On my former visit to Jamaica I found on my estate a poor   
woman nearly one hundred years old, and stone blind.  She was   
too infirm to walk, but two young negroes brought her on their   
backs to the steps of my house, in order, as she said, that she   
might at least touch massa, although she could not see him.   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0166" n="149"/>
   
When she kissed my hand, " that was enough," she said ;    
"now me hab once kiss a massa's hand, me willing to die tomorrow, me no   
care."  She had a   
woman appropriated to her   
servic, and was shown the greatest care and attention ; however, she did   
not live many months   
after my departure.  There   
was aso a mulatto about thirty years of age, named Bob, who   
had been almost deprived of the use of is limbs by the horrible   
cocoa-bay, and had never done the least work since he was fifteen.   
He was so gentle and humble, and so fearful, from the consciousnss of his   
total inability of   
soliciting my notice, that I could not   
help pitying the poor fellow ; and whenever he came in my way   
I always sought to encourage him by little presents, and other   
trifling marks of favour.  His thus unexpectedly meeting with   
distinguishing kindness where he expected to be treated as a   
worthless incumbrance, made a strong impression on his mind.   
Soon afte my departure his malady assumed a more active appearance, but   
during the last stages   
of its progress the only fear   
which he expressed was, that he should not live till Christmas,   
when my return was expected to a certainty.   In the meanwhile he   
endeavoured to find out a   
means of being of some little   
use to me, although his weak constitution would not allow of his   
being of much.  Some of his relations being in opulent circumstances, they   
furnished him with a   
horse, for he was too weak to   
walk for more than a few minutes at a time, and mounted upon    
this, he passed all his time in traversing the estate, watching the   
corn that it might not be stolen, warning the pen-keepers if any   
of the cattle had found their way into the cane-pieces, and doing   
many other such little pieces of service to the property ; so that,   
as the negores said, " if he had been a white man he might have   
been taken for an overseer."  At length Christmas arrived.  It   
was known that I was on the sea ; Bob, too, was still allive ; but   
still there was nothing to be heard of me.  His perpetual question to all   
who came to  visit him   
was " How was the wind?"   
and he was constantly praying to the wind and the ocean to   
bring massa's vessel soon to Savannah la Mar, that he might but   
see him once more,  and thank him, before he died.  At length   
I landed ; and when on the day of my arrival on my estate I   
expressed my surprise at the non-appearance of several of the   
negroes who had appeared to be most attached to me, and I had   
   
   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0167" n="150"/>
   
expected to find most in forward in greeting me, I was told that a    
messenger had been sent to call them, and that their absence was   
occasioned by their attendance at poor Bob's funeral.  Several   
of his relations who nursed him on his death-bed, have assured    
me that the last audible words which he uttered were, " No   
news of massa yet?"

<p>I think that I really may now venture to hope that my plans    
for the management of my estate have succeeded beyond even    
my most sanguine expectations. I have now passed three weeks    
with my negroes, the doors of my house open all day long, and,    
full liberty allowed to every person to come and speak to me    
without witnesses or restraint; yet not one man or woman has    
come to me with a single complaint. On the contrary, all my    
inquiries have been answered by an assurance, that during the    
two years of my absence my regulations have been adhered to    
most implicitly, and that, " except for the pleasure of seeing    
massa," there was no difference. Many of them have come to   
tell me instances of kincluess which they have received from one   
or other of their superintendents ; others to describe some severe   
fit of illness in which they must have died but for the care taken   
of them in the hospital ; some, wko were weakly and low-spirited upon my   
former visit, to show   
me how much they are improved in health, and tell me " how they keep up   
heart now,   
because since massa come upon the property nobody put upon   
them, and all go well;" and some who had formerly complained   
of one trifle or other, withdraw their complaints, and say that   
they want no charge, and are willing to be employed in any way   
that might be thought most for the good of the estate. Although   
I have now at least  <hi rend="italic"> seen  </hi> every one of them, and have ; conversed   
with numbers, I have not yet been able to find one person who   
had so much as even an imaginary grievance to lay before me.   
Yet I find that it has been found necessary to punish with the   
I h, although only in a very few instances ; but then t</p>   
<p>his only   
took place on the commission of absolute  <hi rend="italic"> crimes,  </hi> and in cases   
where its necessity and justice were so universally felt, not only   
by others, but by the sufferes themsleves, that instead of complaining, they   
seem only to be   
afraid of their offence coming to   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0168" n="151"/>
   
my knowledge: to prevent which, they affect to be more satisfied    
and happy that all the rest ; and now when I see a mouth grinning from ear   
to ear with more than   
ordinary expansion of  jaw,   
I never fail to find an inquiry, that its proprietor is one of those   
who have been punished during my absence.  I then take care   
to give them an opportunity of making a complaint, if they   
should have any to make ; none is uttered : " everything   
has gone perfectly well, and just as it ought to have done."   
Upon this I drop a slight hint of the offence in question, and   
instantly away goes the grin, and down falls the negor to kiss   
my feet, confess his fault, and " beg msaa forgib, and them   
never do so bad thing more to fret massa, and them beg massa   
pardon, hard,  quite hard!"  But not one of them has denied the   
justice of his superintendant, complained of undue severity on the   
part of his superintendents.   
</p><p> On the other hand, although the lash has thus been in a manner utterly   
abolished, except in   
cases where a much severer   
punishement would have been inflicted by the police, and although   
they are aware if this unwillingness to chastise, my trustee   
acknowledged that during my absence the negroes have been   
wueit and tractable, and have not only laboured as well as they   
used to do, but have done much more work than the negroes on   
an adjoining property, where the number is considerably larger,   
and where, moreover, a considerable sum is paid for hired assistance.    
Having now waited three   
weeks to see how they would   
conduct themselves, and found no cause for dissatisfaction since   
the neglect of the watchmen to guard the cattle (and which they   
one and all attribute to their joy at seeing me again), I thought   
it time distribute the presents which I had brought for them   
from England.   
</p><p> During my absence I had ordered a new and additional hospital to be   
built, intented entirely   
for the use of lying-in women,   
nursing mothers, and cases of a serious nature, for which purpose   
it is to be provided with every possible comfort ; while the old   
hosptial is to be reserved for those who have little or nothing   
the matter with them, but who obstinately insist upon their being   
too ill to work, in defiance of the opinion of all their medical   
attendants. The new hospital is not quite finished ; but wishing   
to connect it as much as possible with pleasurable associations,   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0169" n="152"/>
   
I took occasion of the distribution of presents to open it for the    
first time. Accordingly, the negroes were summoned to the new    
hospital this morning ; the rooms were sprinkled with Madeira    
for good luck, and the toast of " Health to the new hospital,    
and shame to the old lazy house! " was drunk by the trustee,    
the doctoresses, the governors, &amp;c., and received by the whole    
assembly of negroes with loud cheering ; after which every man    
received a blue jacket lined with flannel, every woman a flaming    
red stuff petticoat, and every child a frock of white cotton. They    
then fell to dancing and singing, and drinking rum and sugar,    
which occupations they have kept up till a much later hour than    
would be at all approved of by the bench of bishops; for it is    
now Sunday morning, and they are still dancing and singing    
louder than ever.

<p>To-day divine service was performed at Savannah la Ma for    
the first time these five weeks. The rector has been indisposed    
lately with the lumbago: he has no curate ; and thus during    
five whole weeks there was a total cessation of public worship.    
I had told several of my female acquaintance that it was long    
since they had been to church, that I was afraid of their forgetting all about   
it, and that if there   
should be no service for a    
week longer I should think it my duty to come and hear them    
say their Catechism myself. Luckily the rector recovered, and    
saved me the trouble; but the long privation of public prayer    
did not seem to have annoyed them, and I have seldom witnessed    
a more meagre congregation. I cannot discover that the negroes    
have any external forms of worship, nor any priests in Jamaica,    
unless their Obeah-men should be considered as such; but still    
I cannot think that they ought to be considered as totally devoid    
of all natural religion. There is no phrase so common on their    
tips as " God bless"you! " and " God preserve you! " and " God    
will bless you wherever you go ! " phrases which they pronounce    
with every appearance of sincerity, and as if they came from the    
very bottom of their hearts. "God-A'mity! God-A'mity!"    
is their constant exclamation in pain and in sorrow. This proves   
their belief in a Supreme Being.  But they have even got a step   
further : for they also allow the existnece of an evil principle.   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0170" n="153"/>
   
From their language they appear to believe that hell is a place    
of torment, and that the devil reigns there ; and surely they    
could not be afraid of duppies (or ghosts) without some idea of    
a future state ; and indeed, nothing is more firmly impressed    
upon the mind of the Africans, than that after death they shall    
go back to Africa and pass an eternity in revelling and feasting    
with their ancestors.   
</p><p>  
The, proprietor of a neighbouring estate lately used all his influence to   
persuade his foster-sister   
to be christened, but it was    
all in vain ; she bad imbibed strong African prejudices from her    
mother, and frankly declared that she found nothing in the    
Christian system so alluring to her taste as the post-obit balls    
and banquets promised by the religion of Africa. I confess that    
this prejudice appears to me to be so strongly rooted, that I am    
sadly afraid the efforts of the curates who are expected to be sent    
out by the Bishop of London will avail but little ; and that the    
rewards after death which Christianity offers will be outweighed    
by the pleasures of eating fat hog, drinking raw rum, and dancing for   
centuries to the jam-jam   
and kitty-katty.

 On my arrival I found that idle rogue Nato, as usual, an inmate of the   
hospital, where he   
regularly passes at least nine    
months out of the twelve. He was with infinite difficulty per-suaded at the end of a fortnight to employ himself about the    
carriage-horses for a couple of days; but on the third he re-turned to the hospital, although the medical attendants, one and    
all, declared nothing to be the matter with him, and the doctors    
even refused to insert his name in the sick-list. Still he persisted    
in declaring himseld to be too ill to do a single stroke of work :    
so on Thursday I put him into one of the sick-rooms by himself,    
and desired him to get well with the doors locked, which he    
would find to the full as easy as with the doors open ; at the   
same time assuring him that he should never come out till he    
should be sufficiently recovered to cut canes in the field. He    
held good all Friday; but Saturday being a holiday, he declared    
huself to be in a perfect state of health, and desired to be re-leased. However, I was determined to make him suffer a little    
his lying and obstinacy, and would not suffer the doors to be   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0171" n="154"/>
   
opened for him till this morning, when he quitted the hospital,   
saluted on all sides by loud huzzas in congratulation of his   
amended health, and which followed him during his whole   
progress to the cane-piece. I was informed that a lad named   
Epsom, who used to be perpetually running away, had been   
stationary for the last two years. So on Wednesday last, as he   
happened to come in my way, I gave him all proper commendation for   
having got rid of his bad   
habits; and to make the   
praise better worth his having, I added a maccarony: he was   
gratified in the extreme, thanked me a thousand times, promised   
most solemnly never to behave ill again, and ran away that very   
night. However, he returned on Saturday morning, and was   
brought to me all rags, tears, and penitence, wondering " how   
he could have had such  <hi rend="italic"> bad manners  </hi> as to make massa fret."

<p>Some of the free people of colour possess slaves, cattle, and   
other property left them by their fathers, and are in good circumstances;   
but few of them are   
industrious enough to increase   
their possessions by any honest exertions of their own. As to   
the free blacks, they are almost uniformly lazy and improvident,   
most of them half-starved, and only anxious to live from hand to   
mouth. Some lounge about the highways with pedlar-boxes   
stocked with various worthless baubles ; others keep miserable   
stalls provided with rancid butter, damaged salt pork, and other   
such articles: and these they are always willing to exchange   
for stolen rum and sugar, which they secretly tempt the negroes   
to pilfer from their proprietors ; but few of them ever endeavour to earn   
their livelihood   
creditably.  Even those who   
profess to be tailors, carpenters, or coopers, are, for the most part,   
careless, drunken, and dissipated, and never take pains sufficient   
to attain any dexterity in their trade. As to a free negro hiring   
himself out for plantation -labour, no instance of such a thing   
was ever known in Jamaica; and probably no price, however  
great, would be considered by them as a sufficient temptation.

The Africans and Creoles hate each other most cordially.  
Yesterday, in the field, a girl who had taken some slight offence   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0172" n="155"/>
   
at something said to her by a young boy, immediatley struck   
him with the bill with which she was cutting canes.  Luclily   
his loose wrapper saved him from the blow, and on his running away she   
threw the bill after him   
in his flight with all the   
fury and malice of a fiend.  This same vixen, during my former   
visit, had been punished for having her teeth in the hand of one   
of the other girls, and nearly biting her thumb off, and on hearing of this   
fresh instance of   
devilism, I asked her mother "how   
she came to have so bad a daughter, when all her sons were so   
mild and good?"  " Oh massa,"  answered she,  " the girl's   
father was a Guinea-man."

Neptune came this morning to request that the name of his   
son, Oscar, might be changed to that of Julius, which (it   
seems) had been that of his own father.  The child, he said,   
had always been weakly, and he was persuaded that its ill-health   
proceeded frin his deceased grand-father's being displeased, because it had   
not been called after   
him.  The other day, too, a   
woman, who had a child sick in the hospital, begged me to   
change its name for any other which might please me best&mdash;she   
cared not what ; but she was sure that it would never do well   
so long as it should be called Lucia.   Perhaps, this prejudice   
respecting the power of names produces in some measure their   
unwillingness to be christened.  They find no change produced   
in them, except the alteration if their namem and hence they   
conclude that  this name contains in it some secret power ; while,   
on the other hand, theu conceive that the ghosts of their ancestors cannot   
fail to be offended at   
their abandoning an appellation,   
either hereditary in the family or given by themselves.  It is   
another negro prejudice, that the eructation of the breath of a   
sucking child has something in it venomous ; and frequently   
nursing mothers, on showing the doctor a swelled breast, will   
very gravely and positively attribute it to the infant's having   
broken wind while hanging on the nipple.

<p>A negro, named Adam, has long been the terror of my whole    
estate. He was accused of being an Obeah-man ; and persons    
notorious for the practice of Obeah, and who were afterwards    
convicted and transported, had been found concealed in his house.    
He was strongly suspected of having poisoned more than twelve    
negroes, men and women; and, having been displaced by my    
former trustee from being principal governor, in revenge be put    
poison into his water-jar. Luckily he was observed by one of    
the house-servants, who impeached him, and prevented the intended   
mischief.  For this offence   
he ought to have been given    
up to justice ; but being brother of the trustee's mistress, she    
found means to get him off, after undergoing a long confinement   
in the stocks. I found him, at my first visit, living in a state of    
utter excommunication : I tried what reasoning with him could   
effect, reconciled him to his companions, treated him with marked   
kindness, and he promised solemnly to behave well during my    
absence. However, instead in attributing my lenity to a wish    
to reform him, his pride and confidence in his own talents and   
powers of deception made him attribute the indulgence shown   
him to his having obtained an influence over my mind.  This he   
determined to employ to his own purposes upon my return ; so   
he set about forming a conspiracy against Sully, the present   
chief governor, and boasted, on various estates in the neighbourhood, that   
on my arrival he would take care to get Sully broke,   
and himself substituted in his place.  In the meanwhile he   
quarrelled and fought right and left ; and I now found the whole   
estate in an uproar about him.  no less than three charges of   
assault, with intent to kill, were preferred against him.  In a fit   
of jealousy he had endeavoured to strangle Marlborough with   
the thong of  whip, and had nearly affected his purpose before   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0174" n="157"/>
   
he could be dragged away; he had knocked down Nato in some   
trifling dispute, and while the man was senseless had thrown him   
into the river to drown him ; and having taken offence at a poor   
weak creature called Old Rachael, on meeting her by accident   
he struck her to the ground, beat her with a supplejack, stamped   
upon her belly, and begged her to be assured of his intention   
( as he eloquently worded it) " to kick her guts out." The breeding mothers   
also accused him of having been the cause of the   
poisoning a particular spring, from which they were in the habit   
of fetching water for their children, as Adam on that morning   
had been seen near the spring without having any business there,   
and he had been heard to caution his little daughter against   
drinking water from it that day, although be stoutly denied both   
circumstances.  Into the bargain, my head blacksmith, being   
perfectly well at five o'clock, was found by his son dead in his   
bed at eight; and it was known that he had lately had a dispute   
with Adam, who on that day had made it up with him, and had   
invited him to drink, although it was not certain that his offer   
had been accepted. He had, moreover, threatened the lives of   
many of the best negroes. Two of the cooks declared that he   
severally directed them to dress Sully's food apart, and had   
given them powders to mix with it. The first to whom he aplied refused   
positively ; the second he   
treated with liquor, and   
when she had drunk he gave her the poison, with instructions   
how to use it: being a timid creature, she did not dare to object,   
so threw away the powder privately, and pretended that it had   
been administered : but, finding no effect produced by it, Adam   
gave her a second powder, at the same time bidding her remember the   
liquor which she had   
swallowed, and which he assured   
her would effect her own destruction, through the force of Obeah,   
unless she prevented it by sacrificing his enemy in her stead.   
The poor creature still threw away the powder, but the strength   
of imagination brought upon her a serious malady, and it was   
not till several weeks that she recovered from the effects of   
her fears.   
</p><p>The terror thus produced was universal throughout the estate,   
abd Sully and several other principal negroes requested me to   
remove them to my property in St. Thomas', as their lives were   
not safe while breathing the same air with Adam.  However, it   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0175" n="158"/>
   
appeared a more salutary measure to remove Adam himself ; but   
all the poisoning charges either went no further than strong    
suspicion, or (any more than the assaults) were not liable by the   
laws of Jamaica to be punished, except by flogging or temporary   
imprisonment, which would only have returned him to the estate   
with increased resentment against those to whom he should    
ascribe his sufferings, however deserved. However, on searching his   
house, a musket, with a   
plentiful accompaniment of powder and ball, was found concealed, as also   
a considerable   
quantity    
of materials for the practice of Obeah: the possession of either    
of the above articles (if the musket is without the consent of the    
proprietor) authorizes the magistrates to pronounce a sentence    
of transportation. In consequence of this discovery, Adam was   
immediately committed to gaol ; a slave court was summoned   
and to-day a sentence of transportation from the island was pronounced,   
after a trial of three   
hours. As to the man's guilt, the   
jury entertained no doubt, but the difficulty was to restrain the    
verdict to transportation. We produced nothing which could    
possibly affect his life; for although perhaps no offender ever   
better deserved hanging, yet I confess my being weak-minded    
enough to entertain doubts whether hanging or other capital   
punishment ought to be inflicted for any offence whatever.   
However, although I did my best to prevent Adam from being   
hanged, it was no easy matter to prevent his hanging himself.   
The Obeah ceremonies always commenced with what is called    
by the negroes the " Myal dance."  This is intended to remove    
any doubt of the chief Obeah-man's supernatural powers; and,    
in the course of it, he undertakes to show his art by killing one   
of the persons present, whom he pitches upon for that purpose.    
He sprinkles various powders over the devoted victim, blows   
upon him, and dances round him, obliges him to drink a liquor   
prepared for the occasion ; and, finally, the sorcerer and his   
assistants seize him and whirl him rapidly round and round till    
the man loses his senses, and falls on the ground, to all appearance and the   
belief of the   
spectators, a perfect corpse. The chief    
Myal-man then utters loud shrieks, rushes out of the house with    
wild and frantic gestures, and conceals himself in some neighbouring   
wood. At the end of two or   
three hours he returns    
with a large bundle of herbs, from some of which he squeezes   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0176" n="159"/>
   
the juice into the mouth of the dead person ; with others he    
anoints his eyes.and stains the tips of his fingers; accompanying    
the ceremony with a great variety of grotesque actions, and    
chanting all the while something between a song and a howl,    
while the assistants, hand-in-hand, dance slowly round them in a    
circle, stamping the ground loudly with their feet to keep time   
with his chant.  A considerable time elapses before the desired   
effect is produced, but at length the corpse gradually recovers    
animation, rises from the ground perfectly recovered, and the    
Myal dance concludes. After this proof of his power, those who    
wish to be revenged upon their enemies apply to the sorcerer for    
some of the same powder which produced apparent death upon    
their companion; and, as they never employ the means used for    
his recovery, of course the powder once administered never fails    
to be lastingly fatal. It must be superfluous to mention that    
the Myal-man on these.occasions substitutes a poison for a   
narcotic.   
</p><p>  
Now, among other suspicious articles found in Adam's hut,    
there was a string of beads, of various sizes, shapes, and colours   
arranged in a form peculiar to the performance of the Obeahman in the   
Myal dance.  Their use was so well known, that   
Adam on his trial sis not even attempt to deny that they could   
serve for no purpose nut the practice of Obeah ; but he endeavoured to   
refure their being his own property, and with this   
view he began to narrate the means  by which he had become   
possessed of them.  He said that they belonged to Fox ( a negro   
who was lately transported ), from whom he had taken them at a    
Myal dance held on the estate of Dean's Valley ; but as the   
assistants at one of these dances are by law condemned to death   
equally with the principal performer, the court had the humanity   
to interrupt his confession of having been present on such an   
occasionm and thus saved him from criminating himself so deeply   
as to render a capital punishment inevitable.  I understand that   
he was quite unabashed and at his ease the whole time ; upon   
hearing his sentence he only said very coolly, " Well ! I can't   
help it !"  turned himself round and walked out of the  court.   
  
</p><p> This fellow was a great hypocrite.  When on my arrival he   
gave me a letter, filled with the grossest lies respecting the   
trustee, and every creditable negro on the estate, he took care to   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0177" n="160"/>
   
sign it by the name which he had lately received in baptism: and,    
in his defence at the bar, to prove his probity of character and    
purity of manners, he informed the court that for some time past    
he had been learning to read, for the sole purpose of learning    
the Lord's Prayer. The nick-name by which he was generally    
known among the negroes in this part of the country was Buonaparte, and   
he always appeared to   
exult in the appellation. Once    
condemned, the marshal is bound, under a heavy penalty, to see   
him shipped from off the island before the expiration of six    
weeks; and probably he will be sent to Cuba. He is a finelooking man,   
between thirty and forty,   
square built, and of great    
bodily strength ; and his countenance equally expresses intelligence and malignity. The sum   
allowed me for him is one hundred pounds currency, which is scarcely a   
third of his worth as a labourer, but is the highest value which a jary is permitted to    
award.

<p>Last night the negroes of Friendship took it into their ingenious heads to   
pay me a compliment of an extremely inconvenient    
nature. They thought that it would be highly proper to treat me   
with a nightly serenade, just by way of showing their  <hi rend="italic"> enjoyment </hi>     
on my return ; and, accordingly, a large body of them arrived at    
my doors about midnight, dressed out in their best clotbes, and    
accompanied with drums, rattles, and their whole orchestra of    
abominable instruments, determined to pass the whole night in   
singing and dancing under my windows.  Luckily, my negrogovernors   
heard what was going forwards, and knowing my taste   
a little better than my visitors, they hastened to asure them of   
my being in bed and asleep, and with much difficulty persuaded   
them to remve into my village.  Here they contented themselves with   
making a noise for the greatest part of the night ;   
and the nest morning, after coming up to see me at breakfast,   
they went away quietly.  One of them only remained, to inquire   
particularly after Lady H&mdash;, as her mother had been her nurse,   
and she was very particular in her inquiries as to her health, her   
children, their ages,  and names.  When she went away I gave   
her a plentiful provision of bread, butter, plantains, and cold   
ham from the breakfast-table, part of which she sat down to eat,   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0178" n="161"/>
   
intending, as she said, to carry the rest to her piccaniny at    
home. But, in half an hour after, she made her appearance    
again, saying she was come to take leave of me, and hoped I    
would give her a  <hi rend="italic"> bit </hi>  to buy tobacco. I gave her a maccaroni,    
which occasioned a great squall of delight. Oh! since I had    
given her so much, she would not buy tobacco, but a fowl ; and    
then, when I returned, she would bring me a chicken from it for    
my dinner; that is, if she could keep the other negroes from    
stealing it from her&mdash;a piece of extraordinary good luck of    
which she seemed to entertain but slender hopes. At length off    
she set ; but she had scarcely gone above ten yards from the    
house when she turned back, and was soon at my writing-table   
once more, with a " Well! here me come to massa again! " So   
then she said that she had meant to eat part of the provisions   
which I had given her, and carry home the rest to her boy; but   
that really it was so good she could not help going on eating and   
eating till she had eaten the whole, and now she wanted another   
bit of cold ham to carry home to her child, And then she should   
away perfectly contented. I ordered Cubina to give her a   
hunch of it, and Mrs. Phillis at length took her departure   
for good and all.

<p> I set out to visit my estate in St. Thomas's in   
the East, called Hordley. It is at the very furthest extremity of the island, and   
never was there such a journey.  Something disagreeable happened at   
every step.  My accidents commenced before I had   
accomplished ten miles from my own house ; for in passing along   
a narrow shelf of rock which overhangs the sea near Blue-fields,   
a pair of young blood-horses in my carriage took fright at the   
roaring of the waves which dashed violently against them, and   
twice nearly overturned me.  On the second occasion one of   
them actually fell down into the water, the the off-wheel flew   
up into the air, and the curricle remained suspended, balancing   
backwards and forwards, like Mahomet's coffin.  Luckily, time   
was allowed the horse to recover his legs ; down came the whell   
once more on terra firma, and on we went again.  We slept at   
Cashew ( an estate near Lacovia ), and the next morning at daylight   
proceeded to cllimb the Bogr. a mountain so difficult of   
ascent that everyone had pronounced the attempt to be hopeless   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0179" n="162"/>
   
with horses so young as mine; but those horses were my only   
ones, and therefore I was obliged to make the trial. The road    
is bordered by tremendous precipices for about twelve miles; the   
path is so narrow that a servant must always be sent on before   
to make any carts, which may be descending, stop in recesses   
hollowed out for this express purpose; and the cartmen are   
obliged to sound their shells repeatedly, in order to give each   
other timely warning. The chief danger, however, proceeds   
from the steepness of the road, which in some places will not    
permit the waggons to stop, however well their conductors may    
be inclined; then down they come, drawn by twelve or fourteen,    
or sometimes sixteen oxen, sweeping everything before them ;   
and any carriage unlucky enough to find itself in their course    
must infallibly be dashed over the precipice. To-day, it really   
appeared as if all the estates in the island had agreed to send    
their produce by this particular road ; the shells formed a complete chorus,   
and sounded incessantly during our whole passage    
of the mountain; and at one time there was a very numerous   
accumulation of carts and oxen, in consequence of my carriage    
coming to a complete stop. As we were ascending,&mdash;" It is very    
well," said Mr. Hill, who was travelling with me, " that we did    
not come by this road three months sooner. I remember about    
that time travelling it on horseback, and an enormous tree had   
fallen over the path, and hung so low that a chaise with a canopy could not   
have passed ; but , of course, the obstacle must   
now be removed : if I remember right, this must have been the   
very spot.....and, as I hope to live, yonder is the very tree   
still !"  And so it proved : although three months had elapsed,   
the impediment had been suffered to remain in unmolested possession of   
the road, and to pass my carriage under it proved an   
absolute impossibility.  after much discussion, and many fruitless   
attempts, we at length succeeded in unscewing the wheels,   
lifting off the body, which we carried aalong, and then built the   
curricle up again on the opposite side of the tree.  However, by   
one means or other, we found ourselves at the bottom of the   
mountain ; but the fatal tree, and the delay occasioned by taking   
unavoidable shelter from the tremendous storms of rain, had cost us    
so much time that night surprised us when we were still eight   
miles distant from our destined inn.  The night was dark as   
night could be ; no moon, no stars, nor any light except the   
  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0180" n="163"/>
   
flashing of myriads of fire-flies, which, flapping in the faces of    
the young horses, frightened them and made them rear. The   
raod, too, was full of water-trenched, precipices, and deep and   
dangerous holes.  As to the gorund, it was quite invisible, and   
we had no means of proceeding with any chance of safety except   
by making some of the servants lead the horses, while the others   
went before us to explore the way, while they cried out every    
moment, " Take care ; a little to the left, or you will slipp into   
that wate-trench&mdash;a little to the right, or you will tumble over   
that precipice."  Into the bargain, there was neither inn nor   
gentleman's house within reach ; and thus we proceeded crawling along at   
a foot's pace for five   
wretched miles, when we at   
length stopped to beg a shelter for the night at a small estate   
called Porous.  By thistime it was midnight&mdash;all the family was   
gone to bed&mdash;the gates were all locked ; during which I sat in an   
open carriage, perspiration streaming down from my head to my   
feet, through vexationm impatience, and fatigue, while the nightdew fell   
heavy and the night-breeze blew keen ; which (as I had   
frequently been assured) was the very best recipe possible for   
getting a Jamaica fever.  On such I counted, both for myself   
and my white servant, when I at length laid myself sown in a   
bed at Porous ; but, to my equal surprise and satisfactio, we   
both rose the next morning without feeling the slightest inconvenience.    
On Friday, the 5th, I  eached Spanish Town ; and    
the next night slept at Kingston.

<p>I resumed my journey; but my horses were so completely   
knocked up that I was obliged to hire an additional pair to convey me to   
Miss Hetley's inn, on the other side of the Yallacks   
River, which is nineteen miles from Kingston. This river, as   
well as that of Morant (which I passed about ten miles further),   
both in breadth and strength, sets all bridges at defiance ; and in   
the rainy season it is sometimes impassable for several weeks.   
On this occasion there was but little water in either, and I   
arrived without difficulty at Port Morant, where I found horses   
sent by my trustee to convey me to Hordley. The road led up   
to the mountains, and was one of the steepest, roughest, and most   
  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0181" n="164"/>
   
fatiguing that I ever travelled&mdash;in spite of its picturesque beauties.   
</p>   
  
<p>At length I reached my journey's end, jaded and wearied    
to death: here I expected to find a perfect paradise, and I found    
a perfect bell.  Report bad assured me that Hordley was the   
best-managed estate in the island ; and, as far as the soil was    
concerned, report appeared to have said true : but my trustee    
tiad also assured me that my negroes were the most contented    
and best-disposed, and here there was a lamentable incorrectness    
in the account. I found them in a perfect uproar; complaints    
of all kinds stunned me from all quarters : all the blacks accused    
all the whites, and all the whites accused all the blacks; and as    
far as I could make out, both parties were extremely in the right.    
There was no attachment to the soil to be found  <hi rend="italic"> here  </hi> ; the negroes   
declared, one and all, that if I went away and left them to    
groan under the-same system of oppression -without appeal or    
hope of redress, they would -follow my carriage and establish    
themselves at Cornwall. I had soon discovered enough to be    
certain that, although they told me plenty of falsehoods, many    
of their complains were but too well founded ; and yet how to    
protect them for the future, or satisfy them for the present was    
no easy matter to decide. Trusting to these fallacious reports of    
the Arcadian state of happiness upon Hordley, I had supposed    
that I should have nothing to do there but grant a few indul-gences and establish the regulations already adopted with suc-cess at Cornwall ; distribute a little money, and allow a couple   
of play-days for dancing : and under this persuasion I had made   
it quite impossible for me to remain above a week at Hordley,   
which I conceived to be fully sufficient for the above purpose.   
As to grievances to be redressed,  I wa totally unprepared for   
any such neccessity ; yet now they poured in upon me incessantly,   
each more serious than the former ; and before twenty-four hours   
were elapsed I had been assured that, in order to produce any   
sort of tranquility upon the estate, I must begin be displacing   
the trustee, the physician, the four white book-keepers, and the   
four black governors ; all of whom I was modestly required to remove,   
and provide better substitutes, in the space of fice days and   
a morning.  What with the general clamour, the assertions and   
denials, the tears and the passion, the odious falsehoods, and the   
  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0182" n="165"/>
   
still more odious truths, and ( worst of all to me) my own vexation and   
disappointment at finding these things so different from my   
expectations, my brain was nearly turned, and I felt strongly   
tempted to set off as fast as I could, and leave all these black   
and white devils to tear one another to pieces&mdash;an amusement in   
which the appeared to be perfectly ready to indulge themselves.   
It was, however, considerable relief to me to find, upo examination, that   
no act of personal ill-treatment was alleged against the    
trustee himself, who was allowed to be sufficiently humane  in his   
own nature, and was only complained of for allowing the negroes to be   
maltreated by the book-keepers, and other inferior   
agents, with absolute impunity.  Being an excellent planter, he   
confined his attention entirely to cultivation of the soil, and    
when the negroes came to complain of some act of cruelty or    
oppression committed by the book-keepers or the black governors, he   
reused to listen to them, and left their complaints   
uninquired into, and consequently unredressed.  The result was,   
that the negroes were worse off than if he had been a cruel man   
himself ; for his cruelty would have given them only one tyrant,   
whereas his indolence left them at the mercy of eight.  Still they   
said they would be well contented to have him continue their   
trustee, provided that I would appoint some protector, to whom   
they might appeal in cases of injustice and ill-usage.  The    
trustee declaring himself well satisfied that some such appointment should   
take place, a neighbouring gentleman (whoe humanity to his own negroes had   
established him in high favour   
with mine ) was selected for this purpose.  I next ordered one of   
the book-keepers ( of the strociious brutality of whose conduct   
the trustee himself, upon examination, allowed that there could   
be no doubt) to quit the estate in two hours, under pain of prosecution : away went the man, and   
when I arose the next morning, another book-keeper had taken himself off of his own accord,   
and that in so much haste that he left all his clothes behind him.   
My next step was to displace the chief black governor, a man   
deservedly odious to the negroes, and whom a gross and insolent   
lie told to myself enabled me to punish without seeming to displace him in   
compliance with their complaints againsts him : and   
these sources of discontent eing removed, Iread tothem my   
regulations for allowing them new hollidays, additional allowances   
  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0183" n="166"/>
   
of salt-fish, rum, and sugar, with a variety of other indulgences and   
measures taken for protection, &amp;c.  All which,   
assisted by a couple of dances and distribution of money on the    
day of my departure, had such an effect upon their tempers that    
I left them in as good humour, apparently, as I found them in bad.   
</p><p>  
But to leave them was no such easy matter ; the weather    
had been bad from the time of my commencing my journey, but    
from the moment of my reaching Hordley it became abominable.    
&mdash;the rain poured down in cataracts incessantly. The old crazy    
house stands on the top of a hill, and the north wind, howled    
round it night and day, shaking it from top to bottom, and    
threatening to become a hurricane. The storm was provided    
with a very suitable accompaniment of thunder and lightning :    
and, to complete the business, down came the mountain-torrents,    
and swelled Plantain-Garden River to such a degree that it    
broke down the dam-head, stopped the mill, and all work was at    
a stand-still for two days and nights. But the worst of all was    
that this same river lay between me and Kingston: bridge there    
was none, and it soon became utterly impassable. Thus it continued for   
four days ; on the fifth (the day which I had appointed    
for my departure, and on which I gave the negroes a parting    
holiday) the water appeared to be somewhat abated at a ford   
about four miles distant; for as to crossing at my own, that was    
quite out of the question for a week at least. A negro was despatched on   
horseback to ascertain the height of the water; his    
report was very unfavourable. However, as at worst I could    
but return, and had no better means of employing my time, I    
resolved to make the experiment. About forty of the youngest    
and stron gest negroes. left their -dancing and drinking and ran    
on foot to see me safe over the water. The few hours which had    
elapsed since my messenger's examination had operated very    
favourably towards the reduction of the water, although it was    
still very high. But, by a servant going before to ascertain the,    
least dangerous passage, and the negroes rushing all into river   
to break the force of the stream, and support the carriage on   
both sides, we were enabled to struggle to the opposite bank,   
and were landed in safety, amidst loud cheering from my sable   
attendants, who then left me, many with tears running down   
  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0184" n="167"/>
   
their cheeks, and all with thanks for the protection which I had    
shown them, and earnest entreaties that I would come to visit    
them another time.  Whether my visit will have been produc-tive of essential service to them, must remain a doubt; the    
trustee at least promised me most solemnly that my regulations    
for their happiness and security should be obeyed; and that the    
slave-laws ( of which I had detected, beyond a doubt, some very    
flagrant violations) should be carried into effect, for the future,   
with the most scrupulous exactness. If he breaks his promise,   
and I discover it, I have pledged myself most solemnly to remove    
him, however great may be his merits as a planter ; if he contrives   
to keep me in ignorance of his proceedings (which, however, from    
the precautions which I have now taken, I trust will be no easy    
matter), and the state of the negroes should continue after my    
departure to be what it was before my arrival, then I can only    
console myself with thinking that the guilt is his, not mine; and    
that it is on  <hi rend="italic"> his </hi>  head that the curse of the sufferers and the    
vengeance of heaven will fall, not on my own. I have been told    
that this estate of mine is one of the most beautiful in the island.    
It may be so, for anything that I can tell of the matter. The   
badness of the weather, and the disquietude of my mind, during    
the whole of my short stay, made everything look gloomy and    
hideous ; and when I once found myself again beyond my own   
limits, I felt my spirits lighter by a hundred weight.   
</p><p>  
Of all the points which had displeased me at Hordley, none    
had made me more angry for the time than the lie told me by    
the chief governor, which occasioned my displacing him. This    
fellow, who for the credit of our family (no doubt) had got himself   
christened by the name of John Lewis, had the impudence   
to walk into my parlour just as I was preparing to go to bed,    
and inform me that he could not get the business of the estate    
done. Why not? He could get nobody to come to the night-work at the mill, which be supposed was the consequence of my    
indulging the negroes so much. Indeed! and where were the   
people who ought to come to their night-work? In the negro   
village?  No ; they were in the hospital, and refused to come   
out to work. Upon which I blazed up like a barrel of gunpowder,   
and asked him whether any person really had been inso-lent enough to select a whole night-party from the sick people   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0185" n="168"/>
   
in the hospital, not one of whom ought to stir out of it till well?   
There stood the fellow, trembling and stammering, and unable,    
to get out an answer, while I stamped up and down the piazza,   
storming and swearing, banging all the doors till the house    
seemed ready to tumble about our ears, and doing my best to    
out-Herod Herod, till at last I ordered the man to be gone that    
instant, and get the work done properly. He did not wait to    
be told twice, and was off in a twinkling. In a quarter of an    
hour I sent for him again, and inquired whether lie had succeeded in   
getting the proper people to work at the mill ? Upon    
which be had the assurance to answer, that all the people were    
there, and that it was not of their not being at the mill that he    
had meant to complain. Of what was it then ? " Of their not    
being in the field." When ? " Yesterday. He could not get    
the negroes to work, and so there had been none done all day."    
And who refused to come ? " All the people." But who?    
"All." But who, who, who ? &mdash;their names? " He could not    
remember them all." Name one. " There was Beck." And    
who else? "There was Sally." And who else? "There was ....    
there was Beck." But who else? "Beck .... and Sally"    
... But who else? who else? " Little Edward had gone out    
of the hospital, and had not come to work." Well! Beck and    
Sally, and little Edward; who else? " Beck, and little Edward,    
and Sally." But who else : I say, who else ? "He could not    
remember anybody else." Upon which I put myself into a most    
imperial passion. " Why, you most impudeut of all impudent    
fellows that ever told a lie, have you really presumed to disturb    
me at this time of night to tell me that you can't get the business    
done, and that none of the people would come to work, and all    
because two old women and a little boy missed coming into the,    
field yesterday !" Down dropped theipfellow in a moment upon    
his marrow-bones : " Oh, me good massa," cried he (and out    
came the truth, which I knew well enough before he told me),   
 " me no come of my own head ; me  <hi rend="italic"> ordered  </hi> to come; but me   
never tell massa lie more, sp me pray him forgib me! " But his   
obeying any person on my own estate in preference to me, and   
suffering himself to be converted into an instrument of my annoyance, was   
not to be easily overlooked, so I turned him out of    
the house, and the next morning degraded him to the rank of a   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0186" n="169"/>
   
common field-negro.  The trustee pleaded hard for his being    
permitted to return to the waggons, where he would be useful.    
But I was obdurate.  Then came his wife to beg for him, and   
then his mother, and then his cousin, and then his cousin's cousin;   
still I was firm: till on the day of my departure the new chief    
governor came to me in the name of the whole estate, and begged    
me allow John Lewis to return to the command of the waggons " for that   
all the negroes said that it would be  <hi rend="italic"> too sad a </hi>    
 <hi rend="italic"> thing  </hi> for them to see a man who had held the highest place    
among them degraded quite to be a common field-negro." There    
was something in this appeal which argued so good a feeling,    
that I did not think it right to resist any longer; so I hinted    
that if the trustee should ask it again as a favour to himself, I    
might perhaps relent; and the proper application being thus    
made, John Lewis was allowed to quit the field, but with a positive   
injunction against his ever   
being employed again in any  office of authority over the negroes.   
</p>   
<p>I found baptism in high vogue upon Hordley, but I am sorry    
to say, that I could not discover much effect produced upon their    
minds by having been made Christians, except in one particular :   
Whenever one of them told me a monstrous lie (and they told me   
whole dozens), he never failed to conclude his story by saying,   
" And now, massa, you know I've been christened, and if you   
do not believe what I say, I'm ready to  <hi rend="italic"> buss the book  </hi> to the   
truth of it." The whole advantages to be derived by negroes from   
becoming Christians seemed to consist with them in two points :   
being a superior species of magic itself, it preserved them from   
black Obeah ; and by enabling thein to take an oath upon the   
Bible to the truth of any lie which it might suit them to tell,   
they believed that it would give them the power of humbugging   
the white people with perfect ease and convenience. They had    
observed the importance attached by the whites to such an attestation, and   
the conviction which it always appeared to carry with    
it ; as to the crime or penalty of perjury, of that they were to-tally ignorant, or at least indifferent; therefore they were perfectly ready to   
"buss the book," which they considered as a    
piece of buckra superstition, mighty useful to the negroes, and    
cared nothing taking their oath upon the Bible to a lie.

<p>Although I set out from Hordley at two o'clock, it was past   
seven before I reached an estate called " The Retreat," which    
was only twelve miles off, so abominable was the road. Here I    
stopped for the night, which I passed at supper with the musquitoes&mdash;" not   
where I ate, but where I was eaten." Morant    
River had been swelled by the late heavy rains to a tremendous    
height, and its numerous quicksands render the passage in such    
a state extremely dangerous. However, a negro having been    
sent early to explore it, and having returned with a favourable    
report, we proceeded to encounter it. A Hordley negro well    
acquainted with these perilous rivers had accompanied me for    
the express purpose of pointing out the most practicable fords :    
but for some time his efforts to find a safe one were unavailing,    
his horse at the end of a minute or two plunging into a quick-sand or some deep hole, among the waters thrown up from which    
he totally disappeared for a moment, and then was seen to struggle    
out again with such an effort and leap, as were quite beyond the    
capability of any carriage's attempting. However, at the end    
of half an hour he was fortunate to find a place where he could    
cross (up to his horse's belly in the water, to be sure), but at    
least without tumbling into holes and quicksands -, and here we   
set out, conscious that our whole chance of reaching the opposite   
shore consisted in keeping precisely the path which he had gone    
already, and determined to stick as close as possible to his horse's    
tail. But no sooner were we fairly in the water than my young    
horses found themselves unable to resist the strength and rapidity    
of the torrent, which was rolling down huge stones as big as    
rocks from the mountain ; and to my utter consternation I perceived the   
curricle carried down the stream, and, the distance    
 from my guide (who by swimming his horse had reached the    
destined landing-place in safety) growing wider and wider with    
every moment. We were now driving at all hazards ; every    
moment I expected to see a horse or a wheel sink down into    
some deep hole, the chaise overturned, and ourselves either swallowed up   
in a quicksand or dashed to pieces against the stones     
which were rolling around us. I never remember to have felt    
myself so completely convinced of approaching destruction, and   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0188" n="171"/>
  
I roared out with all my might and main, "We are carried   
away ! all is over !"  although to be sure, I might as well have   
held my tongue, seeing that all my roaring could not do the   
least possible good.  However, my horses, although too weak to   
resist the current, were fortunately strong enough to keep their    
legs ; while they drifted down the stream they struggled along    
in an oblique direction, which gradually (though but slowly)    
brought us nearer to the opposite shore ; and after several minutes    
passed in most painful anxiety, a desperate plunge out of the    
water enabled them to  <hi rend="italic"> jump </hi>  the carriage upon terra firma on the    
same side with my guide, although at a considerable distance    
from the spot where he had landed.   
</p><p>  
The Yallack River was less dangerous; but even this too   
had been sufficiently swelled to make the crossing it no easy   
matter ; so that what with one obstacle and another, when I    
reached Kingston at six o'clock with my bones and my vehicle   
unbroken, I was almost as much surprised as satisfied. I dined    
with the curate of Kingston, the Rev. G. Hill, where I met the    
admiral upon this station, Sir Home Popham,  and a large party.

<p>I reached Spanish Town in time to dine with the chief justice    
 (Mr. Jackson), and intended to remain there two or three days    
 longer ; but the next morning my landlady just hinted that " she    
 thought it right to let me know, that to be sure there  <hi rend="italic"> was </hi>  a    
 gentleman unwell in the house ; but she supposed that I should    
 not care about it : however, if I particularly   
disliked the neighbourhood of a sick person, she would procure me   
lodgings." I  asked " what was the complaint?"  "Oh ! he was   
a little sick, that was all."  To which I only could answer, that " in that   
case I hoped he would get better," and thought no more about   
it.  However,  when I went to visit the governor, I found that   
this "little sickness" of my landlady's was neither more nor less   
than the yellow fewver, of which the gentleman in question was   
now dying,  of which a lady had died only two days before, and   
of which another European, newly arrived, had fallen ill in this   
very same hotel only a fortnight before, and had died, after   
throwing himself out of an upper window in a fit of delirium.   
Under all these circumstances I thought it to the full as prudent   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0189" n="172"/>
   
not to prolong my stay; and accordingly, on Wednesday the    
18th, I resumed my journey homewards, by the north side of the    
island, the road which I had travelled two years ago. I have    
nothing to add to my former account of it, except that there    
need not be better inns anywhere than the Wellington Hotel at    
Rio Bueno, and Judy James's at Montego Bay. Indeed, all    
the inns upon this road are excellent, with the solitary exception    
of the Blackheath Tavern, which I stopped at by mistake. At    
this most miserable of all inns that ever entrapped an unwary    
traveller, there was literally nothing to be procured for love or    
money : no corn for the horses; no wine without sending six   
miles for it ; no food but a miserable starved fowl, so tough that    
the very negroes could not eat it; and a couple of eggs, one of    
which was addled : there was but one pair of sheets in the whole    
house, and neither candles, nor oranges, nor pepper, nor vinegar,    
nor bread, nor even so much as sugar, white or brown. Yams    
there were, which prevented my servants from going to bed    
quite famished, and I contented myself with the far-fetched bottle    
of wine and the solitary egg, which I ate by the light of a lamp    
filled with stinking oil. The one pair of sheets I seized upon as    
my own share, and my servants made themselves as good beds    
as they could upon the floor with great-coats and travelling    
mantles.

I was very glad to find myself once more quietly established    
at Cornwall, fully determined to leave it no more till I leave it    
on my return to England. The lady who had died so lately at    
Kingston had arrived not long before in a vessel, both the crew    
and passengers of which landed, to all appearance, in perfect   
health, after a favourable passage from England. Of course,    
they soon dispersed in different directions ; yet almost all of them    
were attacked nearly at the same period by the fever, which    
seemed to have a particular commission to search out the persons    
that had arrived by that particular ship.

<p>I am more and more convinced every day, that the best and    
easiest mode of governing negroes is not by the detestable lash,   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0190" n="173"/>
   
but by confinement, solitary or otherwise ; they cannot bear it,   
and the memory of it seems to make a lasting impression upon   
their minds ; while the lash makes none but upon their skins,   
and lasts no longer than the mark. The order at my hospital   
is, that no negro should be denied admittance : even if no   
symptoms of illness appear, he is allowed one day to rest, and   
take physic, if he choose it. On the second morning, if the physician   
declare the man to be shamming, and the plea of illness is   
still alleged, the negro is locked up in a room with others similarly   
circumstanced, where care is taken to supply him with   
food, water, physic, &amp;c., and no restraint is imposed except that   
not going out.  Here he is suffered to remain unmolested as   
long as he pleases, and he is only allowed to leave the hospital   
upon his own declaration that he is well enough to go to work ;   
then the door is opened, and he walks away unreproached and   
unpunished, however evident his deception may have been. Before I   
adopted this regulation, the number of patients used to   
vary from thirty to forty-five, not more than a dozen of whom   
perhaps had anything the matter with them : the number at this   
moment is but fourteen, and all are sores, burns, or complaints,   
the reality of which speaks for itself. Some few persevering   
tricksters will still submit to be locked up for a day or two; but   
their patience never fails to be wearied out by the fourth morning, and I   
have not yet met with an instance of a patient who   
had once been locked up with a fictitious illness, returning to   
the hospital except with a real one. In general, they offer to    
take a day's rest and physic, promising to go out to work the    
next day, and on these occasions they have uniformly kept their    
word.  Indeed, my hospital is now in such good order, that the    
physician told the trustee the other day that " mine gave him    
less trouble than any hospital in the parish."  My boilers, too,    
who used to make sugar the colour of mahograny, are now making   
excellent sugar ; and certainly, if appearances may be    
trusted, and things will but last, I may flatter myself with the    
complete success of my system of management, as far as the   
time elapsed is sufficient to warrant an opinion. I only wish   
from my soul that  I were but half as certain of the good treatment and   
good behaviour of the negroes at Hordley.

<p>Clearing their grounds by fire is a very expeditious proceeding,   
consequently in much practice   
among the negroes; but in    
this tindery country it is extremely dangerous, and is forbidden    
by the law. As I returned home to-day from church, I observed a large   
smoke at no great distance, and Cubina told me,    
he supposed that the negroes of the neighbouring estate of    
Amity were clearing their grounds. " Then they are doing a    
very wrong thing," said I; " I hope they will fire nothing else    
but their grounds, for with so strong a breeze a great deal of    
mischief might be done." However, in half an hour it proved    
that the smoke in question arose from my own negro-grounds,    
that the fire had spread itself, and I could see from my window    
the flames and smoke pouring themselves upwards in large volumes,   
while the crackling of the dry bushes and brush-wood    
was something perfectly terrific. The alarm was instantly    
given, and whites and blacks all hurried to the scene of action.    
Luckily, the breeze set the contrary way from the plantations ;   
a morass interposed itself between the blazing ground and one   
of my best cane-pieces : the flames were suffered to burn till    
they reached the brink of the water, and then the negroes managed to   
extinguish them without much difficulty. Thus we    
escaped without injury,  but I own I was heartily frightened.

<p>I had mentioned to Mr. Shand my having found a woman at   
Hordley, who had been crippled for life, in consequence of her   
having been kicked in the womb by one of the book-keepers.   
He writes to me on this subject :&mdash;"I trust that conduct so   
savage occurs rarely in  <hi rend="italic"> any </hi>  country.  I can only say, that in my   
long experience nothing of the kind has ever fallen under my   
observation."  Now although I have passed six months in   
Jamaica, I have already found on one of my estates a woman   
who had been kicked in the womb by a white book-keeper, by   
which she was crippled, and on another of my estates another   
woman who had been similarly kicked by another white bookkeeper,  by   
which he had crippled the child : and thus, as my   
two estates are at the two extremities of the island, I am entitled   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0192" n="175"/>
  
to say that " white book-keepers kick black women in the belly   
 <hi rend="italic"> from one end of Jamaica to the other</hi> ."

<p>Naturalists and physicians, philosophers and philanthropists,   
may argue and decide as they please ; but certainly, as far as   
mere observations admits of my judging, there does seem to be a   
very great difference between the brain of a black person and a   
white one.  I should think that Voltaire would call a negro's   
reason " une raison tres-particuliere."  Somehow or the other, they   
never can manage to do anything  <hi rend="italic"> quite </hi>  as it should be done.  If   
they correct themselves in one respect to-day they are sure of   
making a blunder in some other manner to-morrow.  Cubina is   
now twenty-five, and has all his life been employed about the   
stable ; he goes out with my carriage twice every day ; yet he   
has never been able to succeed in putting on the harness properly.  Before   
we have proceeded a   
hundred yards we are certain of being obliged to stop, and put something   
or other to rights : and I once laboured for more than half an hour to make   
him understand that the Christmas-holidays came at Christmas ;   
when asked the question, he alwys hesitated, and answered, at   
hap-hazard " July " or " October." Yet, Cubina is far superior   
in intellect to most if the negroes who have fallen under my   
observation.  The girl too, whose business it is to open the   
house each morning, has in vain been desired to unclose all the   
jalousies : she never fails to leave three or four closed, and when   
she is scolded for doing so, she takes care to open those three the   
next morning, and leaves shut the opposite side.  
   
</p><p>  Indeed, the attempt to make them correct a fault is quite   
fruitless : they can never do the same thing a second time in the   
same manner ; and the cook if having succeeded in dressing a    
dish well is desired to dress just such another, she is certain of   
doing something which makes it quite different.  On day I desired that   
there might be always a piece of salt meat at dinner,   
in oorder that I might be certain of always having enough to   
send to the sick in the hospital.  In consequence of this there   
was nothing at dinnr but salt meat.  I complained that there   
was not a single fresh dish, and the next day, there was nothing   
but fresh.  Sometimes there is scarcely anything served up, and   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0193" n="176"/>
   
the cook seems to have forgotten the dinner altogether : she is   
told of it ; and the next day she slaughters without mercy pigs,   
sheep, fowls, ducks, turkeys, and everything that she can lay   
her murderous hands upon, till the table absolutely groans under   
the load of her labours.   
</p><p>For above a month Cubina and I had perpetual quarrels about   
the cats being shut into the gallery at nights, where they threw   
down plates, glasses, and crockery of all kinds, and made such a   
clatter that to get a wink of sleep was quite out of the question.   
Cubina, before he went to rest, hunted under all the beds and   
sofas, and laid about him with a long whip for half an hour   
together ; but in half an hour after his departure the cats were   
at work again.  He was then told that although he had turned    
them out, he must certainly have left some window open : he   
promised to pay particular attention to this point, but that night   
the uproar was worse than ever ; yet he protested that he had   
carefully turned out all the cats, locked all the doors, and shut   
all the windows. He was told, that if he had really turned out   
all the cats, the cats must have got in again, and therefore that   
he must have left some one window open at least.  "No," he   
said, " he had not left one ; but a pane in one of the windows   
had been broken two months before, and it was there that the   
cats got in whenever they pleased."  Yet he had continued to   
turn the cats out of the door with the greatest care, although he   
was perfectly conscious that they could always walk in again at   
the window in five minutes after.   
   
</p><p>   
But the most curious of Cubina's modes of proceeding is   
when it is necessary for him to attack the pigeon-bouse. He   
steals up the ladder as slily and as softly as foot can fall; he opens the   
door, and steals in his head  with the utmost caution ;    
on which, to his never-failing surprise and disappointment, all   
the pigeons make their escape through the open holes ; he has    
now no resource but entering the dove-cot, and remaining there   
with unwearied patience for the accidental return of the birds,   
which nine times out of ten does not take place till late for   
dinner,  and Cubina returns empty-handed.   Having observed   
this proceeding constantly during a fortnight, I took pity upon   
his embarrassment, and ordered two wooden sliders to be fitted   
to the holes.  Cubina was delighted with this exquisite invention,  
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0194" n="177"/>
   
and failed not the next morning to close all the holes on    
the right with one of the sliders ; he then stepped boldly into the    
dove-cot, when to his utter confusion the pigeons flew away    
through the holes on the left. Here then he discovered where    
the fault lay, so he lost no time in closing the remaining aperture with the   
second slider, and the pigeons were thus prevented    
from returning at all. Cubina waited long with exemplary    
patience, but without success, so he abandoned the new invention in   
despair, made no farther use of the sliders, and continues    
to steal up the ladder as he did before.

A few days ago, Nicholas, a mulatto carpenter, was ordered    
to make a box for the conveyance of four jars of sweetmeats, of    
which he took previous measure ; yet in the first instance he    
made a box so small that it would scarcely hold a single jar, and    
than another so large that it would have held twenty ; and when    
at length he produced one of a proper size, he brought it nailed    
up for travelling (although it was completely empty), and nailed    
up so effectually too, that on being directed to open it that the    
jars might be packed, he, split the cover to pieces in the attempt    
to take it off. Yet, among all my negroes, few are equal to    
Nicholas and Cubina in adroitness and intelligence.  Judge then   
what must the remaining three hundred be!

<p>In my medical capacity I sometimes perform cures so unexpected, that I   
stand lke Katterfelto, " with my hair standing on   
end at my wonders."  Last night, Alexander, the second   
governor, who has been seriously ill for some days, sent me   
word, that he was suffering cruelly from a pain in his head, and    
could get no sleep.  I knew not how to relieve him ; but having frequently   
observed a violent passion for perfumes in the   
house of negroes, for want of something else I gave the doctoress   
some oil of lavender, and told her to rub tow or three drops   
upon his nostrils.   This morning, he told me that " to be sure   
what I had sent him was a grand medicine indeed," for it had no   
sooner touched his nose than he felt something cold run up to his   
forehead, over his head, and all the way down his neck to the backbone ;   
instantly, the headache left him, he fell fast asleep, nor   
had the pain returned in the morning.  But I am afraid, that   
  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0195" n="178"/>
   
even this wonderful oil would fail of curing a complaint upon   
which I have just been consulted.  A poor old creature, named   
Quasheba, made her appearance at my breakfast-table, and told   
me, " that she was almost eighty, had been rather weakly for   
some time past, and somehow she did not feel by any means   
right." " Had she seen the doctor ? Did she want physic ? "   
" No, she had taken too much physic already, and the doctor   
would do her no good ; she did not want to see the doctor."   
" But what then was her complaint ? " " Oh! she had no   
particular complaint; only she was old and weakly, and did not   
find herself by any means so well as she used to be, and so she   
came just to tell massa, and see what he could do to make her   
quite right again, that was all."  In short, she  <hi rend="italic"> only </hi>  wanted me   
to make her young again!

<p>A free mulatto of the name of Rolph had frequently been    
mentioned to me by different magistrates, as remarkable for the    
numerous complaints brought against him for cruel treatment of   
his negroes. He was the son of a white ploughman, who at his   
death left him six or seven slaves, with whom he resides in the    
heart of the mountains, where the remoteness of the situation   
secures him from observation or control. His slaves, indeed,    
every now and then contrive to escape, and come down to Savannah la   
Mar to lodge their complaints ; but the magistrates,   
hitherto, had never been able to get a legal hold upon him.   
However, a few days ago, he entered the house of a Mrs. Edgins,    
when she was from home, and behaving in an outrageous manner to her   
slaves he was desired by the head-man to go away.   
Highly incensed, be answered, " that if the fellow dared to speak   
another word, it should be the last that he should ever utter."   
The negro dared to make a rejoinder; upon which Rolph aimed   
a blow at him with a stick, which missed his intended victim,   
but struck another slave who was interposing to prevent a scuffle   
and killed him, upon the spot. The murder was committed in   
the presence of several negroes ; but negroes are not allowed to   
give evidence, and as no free person was present, there are not   
only doubts whether the murderer will be punished, but whether   
he can even be put upon his trial.

<p>This morning I signed the manumission of Nicholas Cameron,   
the best of my mulatto carpenters.  He had been so often on   
the very point of getting his liberty, and still the cup was    
dashed from his lips.  that I had promised to set him free, whenever he   
could precure an able negro as his substitute ; although   
being a good workman, a single negro was by no means an adequate price   
in exchange.  On my arrival this year I found that   
he had agreed to pay 150 <hi rend="italic"> l </hi> . for a female negro, and the woman   
was approved of by my trustee.   But on inquiry it appeared   
that she had a child, from which she was unwilling to part ; and   
her owner refused to sell her child, except at a most unreasonable price.    
Here there was insurmountable objection, and   
Nicholas was told, to his great mortification, the he  must look   
out for another substitute.  The woman, on her part, was determined to   
belong to Cornwall estate and no other : so she told   
her owner, that if he attempted to sell her elsewhere she would   
make away with herself, and on his ordering her to prepare for   
a removal to a neighbouring proprietor's, she disappeared, and   
concealed herself so well, that for some time she was believed to   
have put her threats of suicide into execution.  the idea of   
losing his 150 <hi rend="italic"> l </hi> . frightened her master so completely that he   
declared himself ready to let me have the child at a fair price,   
as well as the mother, if she should ever be found ; and her   
friends having conveyed this assurance to her, she thought proper to   
emerge from her hiding-place, and the bargain was   
arranged finally.   The titles, however, were not yet made out,   
and as the time of my departure for Hordley was arrived, these   
were odered to be got ready against my return, when the negroes   
were to be delivered over to me, and Nicholas was to be set   
free.  In the meanwhile the child was sent by her mistress ( a   
free mulatto ) to hide some stolen ducks upon a distant property,   
and on her return blabbed out the rrand : in consequence the   
mistress was committed to prison for the theft ; and no sooner was   
she released, than she revenged herself upon the poor girl by    
giving her thirty lashes with the cattle-whip, inflicted with all   
the severity of vindictive malice.   This treatment of a child of   
such tender years reduced her to such a state, as made the   
   
   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0197" n="180"/>
   
magistrates think it right to send her for protection to the work-house, until the conduct of the mistress should have been inquired into.  In   
the meanwhile, as the result of the inquiry   
might be the setting the girl at liberty, the joint title for her   
and her mother could not be made out, and thus poor Nicholas's   
manumission was again at a stand-still.  the magistrates at   
length decided, that although the chastisement had been severe   
yet (according to the medical report) it was not such as to   
authorise the sending the mistress to be tried at the assizes.   
She was accordingly dismissed from farther investigation, and   
the girl was once more considered as belonging to me, as soon   
as the title could be made out. But the fatality which had so   
often prevented Nicholas from obtaining his freedom, was not   
weary yet. On the very morning when he was to sign the title   
a person whose signature was indispensable, was thrown out of   
his chaise, the wheel of which passed over his head, and ho   
rendered incapable of transacting business for several weeks.   
Yesterday the titles were at length brought to me complete, and   
this morning put Nicholas in possession of the object, in the   
pursuit of which he has experienced such repeated disappointments.   
    
</p><p>The conduct of the poor child's mulatto mistress in this case   
was more unpardonable, and is the only one of numerous instances   
of a similar description, which have been mentioned to me.   
Indeed, I have every reason to believe that nothing can be uniformly more   
wretched than the lives of the slaves of free people   
of colour in Jamaica ; nor would any thing contribute more to   
the relief of the black population than the prohibiting by law   
any mulatto to become the owner of a slave for the future.   
Why should not rich people of colour be served by poor people   
of colour, hiring them as domestics?  It seldom happens that   
mulattoes are in possession of plantations ; but when a white   
man dies, who happens to possess twenty negroes, he will divide   
them among his brown family, leaving, perhaps, five to each of   
his four children.  These are too few to be employed in plantation work ;   
they have, therefore, to maintain their owner by   
some means or other, and which means are frequently not the   
most honest, the most frequent being the travelling about as   
higglers, and exchanging the trumpery contents of their packs   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0198" n="181"/>
   
and boxes with plantation negroes for stolen rum and sugar.  I   
confess I cannot see why, on such request being made, the law   
should not order the negroes to be sold, and the produce of the   
sale paid to the mulatto heirs, but absolutely prohibiting the   
mulattoes from becoming proprietors of the negroes themselves.   
</p><p>  
 Every man of humanity must wish that slavery, even in its   
best and most mitigated form, had never found legal sanction,   
and must regret that its system is now so incorporated with the   
welfare of Great Britain as well as of Jamaica, as to make its   
extirpation an absolute impossibility, without the certainty of   
producing worse mischiefs than the one which we annihilate.   
But certainly there can be no sort of occasion for continuing on   
the colonies the existence of  <hi rend="italic"> domestic slavery </hi> , which neither   
contributes to the security of the colonies themselves, nor to the   
opulence of the mother-country, the revenue of which derived   
from colonial duties would suffer no defalcation what ever, even   
if neither the whites nor blacks in the West Indies were suffered to   
employ slaves, except in plantation labour.

<p>I  gave my negroes a farewell holiday, on which occasion each   
grown-up person received  a present of a half-dollar, and every   
child a maccaroni.  In return, they expressed their sorrow for   
my departure by eating and drinking, dancing and singing, with   
more vehemence and perserverance than on any other former occasion.   
As in all probability many years will elapse without my making   
them another visit, if indeed I should ever return at all, I have   
exerted myself while here to do everything which appeared likely   
to contribute to their welfare and security during my absence.   
In particular, my attorney has made out a list of all such offences   
as are most usually committed on plantations, to which proportionate   
punishments have been affixed by myself.  From this   
code of internal regulations the overseer is not to be allowed to   
deviate, and the attorney has pledged himself in the most solemn   
manner to adhere strictly to the system laid down for him.  By   
this means the negro will no longer be punished according to   
the momentary caprice of  their superintendent, but by known   
and fixed laws, the one no more than the other, and without respect to   
partiality or prejudice.  Hitherto, in everything which   
had not been previously determined by the public law, with a   
   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0199" n="182"/>
   
penalty attached to the breach of it, the negro has been left   
entirely at the mercy of the overseer, who, if he was a humane    
man, punished him slightly, and if a tyrant, heavily ; nay, very   
often the quantity of punishment depended upon the time of day   
when the offence was made know.  If accused in the morning    
when the overseer was in cold blood and in good humour, a    
night's confinement in the stocks might be deemed sufficient ;   
whereas, if the charge was brought when the superior had taken    
his full proportion of grog or sangaree, the very same offence   
would be visited with thirty-nine lashes.</p>   
   
<p>I have, moreover, taken care to settle all disputes respecting   
property, having caused all negroes having claims upon others   
to bring them before me previous to my departure, and directed,   
that from that time forth no such claim should be inquired into,   
considered as definitively settled by my authority. It would   
have done the Lord Chancellor's heart good to see how many   
suits I determined in the course of a week, and with what expedition I   
made-a clear court of chancery. But perhaps the most   
astonishing part of the whole business was, that after judgement   
was pronounced, the losers as well as the gainers declared themselves   
perfectly satisfied with the justice of the sentence.  I must   
acknowledge, however, that the negro principle that " massa can   
do no wrong," was of some little assistance to me on this occasion. " Oh!   
quite just, me good massa! what massa say, quite   
just ! me no say nothing more ; me good  massa!" Then they   
thanked me " for massa's goodness in giving them so long talk!"   
and went away to tell all the others " how just massa had been   
in taking away what they wanted to keep, or not giving them   
what they asked for." It must be owned that this is not the   
usual mode of proceeding after the loss of a chancery suit in   
England. But to do the negroes mere justice, I must say, that   
I could not have wished to find a more tractable set of people on   
almost every occasion. Some lazy and obstinate persons, of   
course, there must inevitably be in so great a number ; but   
general I found them excellently disposed, and being once thoroughly   
convinced of my real good-will towards them, they took   
it for granted that my regulations must be right and beneficial,    
even in cases where they were in opposition to individual interests and   
popular prejudices.    
 </p><p>   
My attorney bad mentioned to me several points which he   
  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0200" n="183"/>
   
thought it advisable to have altered, but which he had vainly   
endeavoured to accomplish.  For instance, the negroes were in   
the practice of bequeathing their houses and grounds, by which   
means some of there were become owners of several houses and    
numerous gardens in the village, while the others with large families   
were either inadequately provided for, or not provided for at all.   
I directed that from henceforth no negro should possess more   
than one house, with a sufficient portion of ground his family,   
and on the following Sunday the overseer by my order looked    
over the village, took from those who had too much and gave   
to those who had too little, and made an entire new distribution   
according to the most strict Agrarian law.  Those who lost by   
this measure came the next day to complain to me ; when I told   
them it had been done by my order, and explained the propriety   
of the proceeding ; after which they declared themselves contented, and I   
never  heard another murmur on the subject.   
</p><p>   
 Again, mothers being allowed certain indulgences wile suckling, persist   
in continuing the   
operation for two years and upwards, to the great detriment both to   
themselves and their children.    
Complaint if this being made to me,  I sent for the mothers, and told them   
that every child must be sent to the weaning-house   
on the first day of the fifteenth month, but that their indulgences   
should be continued to the mothers for two months longer,   
although the children would be no longer with them.  All who   
had children of  that age immediately gave them up ; the rest   
promised to do so when they should be old enough ; and they all   
thanked me for the continuance of their indulgences, which they   
considered as a boon newly granted them.   
</p><p>   
 On my return from Hordley, I was told that the negroes   
suffered their pigs to infest the works and grounds in the immediate   
vicinity of the house in such numbers, that they were   
become a perfect nuisance ; nor could any remonstrance prevail   
on them to confine the animals within the village.  An order   
was in consequence issued on a Saturday, that the first four pigs   
found rambling at large after two days  should be put to death   
without mercy ; and accordingly on Monday morning at the    
negro breakfast-hour, the head governor made his appearance   
befor ethe house, armed cap-a-pee, with a lance in his hand and   
an enormous cutlass by his side.  The news of this tremendous   
   
   
   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002076_0201" n="184"/>
   
apparition spread through the estate like wildfire.  Immediately        
all was in an uproar ; the negroes came pouring down from all   
quarters; in an instant the whole air was rent with noises of all    
kinds; men, women, and children shouting and bellowing, geese   
cackling, dogs barking, turkeys gobbling; and, look where you   
would, there was a negro running along as fast as he could, and   
dragging a pig along with him by one of the hind legs, while   
the pigs were all astonishment at this, sudden attack, and called   
upon heaven and earth for commiseration and protection, -   
<q><lg><l>"With many a doleful grunt and piteous squeak,</l>  
<l>Poor pigs ! as if their pretty hearts would break!</l></lg></q>  
   
From thenceforth not a pig except my own was to be seen about   
the place; yet instead of complaining of this restraint, several    
of  the negroes came to assure me, that I might depend on the   
animals not being suffered to stray beyond the, village for the   
future, and to thank me, for having given them the warning   
two days before.   
</p><p>What other negroes may be, I will not pretend to gues ; but   
I am certain that there cannot be more tractable or better disposed persons   
(take them for all in all) than my negroes of   
Cornwall.  I only wish, that in my future dealings with white   
persons, whether  <hi rend="italic"> in </hi>  Jamaica or out of it, I could but meet with   
half so much gratitude, affection, and good-will.
