                <p>Several of the sketches in this volume have appeared in periodicals. "The Bloody
                    Doctor" was in <hi rend="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</hi>, "The Confessions of
                    a Duffer," "Loch Awe," and "The Lady or the Salmon?" were in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Fishing Gazette</hi>, but have been to some extent re-written.
                    "The Double Alibi" was in <hi rend="italic">Longman's Magazine</hi>. The author
                    has to thank the Editors and Publishers for permission to reprint these papers.</p>

                <p>The gem engraved on the cover is enlarged from a small intaglio in the collection
                    of Mr. M. H. N. STORY-MASKELYNE, M.P. Such gems were recommended by Clemens of
                    Alexandria <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0019" n="viii"/> to the early Christians.
                    "The figure of a man fishing will put them in mind of the Apostle." Perhaps the
                    Greek is using the red hackle described by AElian in the only known Greek
                    reference to fly-fishing.</p>

                <head>THE CONFESSIONS OF A DUFFER</head>

                <p>These papers do not boast of great sport. They are truthful, not like the tales
                    some fishers tell. They should appeal to many sympathies. There is no false
                    modesty in the confidence with which I esteem myself a duffer, at fishing. Some
                    men are born duffers; others, unlike persons of genius, become so by an infinite
                    capacity for not taking <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0025" n="2"/> pains. Others,
                    again, among whom I would rank myself, combine both these elements of
                    incompetence. Nature, that made me enthusiastically fond of fishing, gave me
                    thumbs for fingers, short-sighted eyes, indolence, carelessness, and a temper
                    which (usually sweet and angelic) is goaded to madness by the laws of matter and
                    of gravitation. For example: when another man is caught up in a branch he
                    disengages his fly; I jerk at it till something breaks. As for carelessness, in
                    boyhood I fished, by preference, with doubtful gut and knots ill-tied; it made
                    the risk greater, and increased the excitement if one did hook a trout. I can't
                    keep a fly-book. I stuff the flies into my pockets at random, or stick them into
                    the leaves of a novel, or bestow them in the lining of my hat or the case of my
                    rods. Never, till 1890, in all my days did I possess a landing-net. If I can
                    drag a fish up a bank, or over the gravel, well; if not, he goes on his way
                    rejoicing. On the Test I thought it seemly to carry a landing- net. It had a
                    hinge, and doubled up. I put the handle through a button- hole of my coat: I saw
                    a big <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0026" n="3"/> fish rising, I put a dry fly over
                    him; the idiot took it. Up stream he ran, then down stream, then he yielded to
                    the rod and came near me. I tried to unship my landing-net from my button-hole.
                    Vain labour! I twisted and turned the handle, it would not budge. Finally, I
                    stooped, and attempted to ladle the trout out with the short net; but he broke
                    the gut, and went off. A landing-net is a tedious thing to carry, so is a creel,
                    and a creel is, to me, a superfluity. There is never anything to put in it. If I
                    do catch a trout, I lay him under a big stone, cover him with leaves, and never
                    find him again. I often break my top joint; so, as I never carry string, I
                    splice it with a bit of the line, which I bite off, for I really cannot be
                    troubled with scissors and I always lose my knife. When a phantom minnow sticks
                    in my clothes, I snap the gut off, and put on another, so that when I reach home
                    I look as if a shoal of fierce minnows had attacked me and hung on like leeches.
                    When a boy, I was--once or twice--a bait-fisher, but I never carried worms in
                    box or bag. I found them under big stones, or in the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0027" n="4"/> fields, wherever I had the luck. I
                    never tie nor otherwise fasten the joints of my rod; they often slip out of the
                    sockets and splash into the water. Mr. Hardy, however, has invented a
                    joint-fastening which never slips. On the other hand, by letting the joint rust,
                    you may find it difficult to take down your rod. When I see a trout rising, I
                    always cast so as to get hung up, and I frighten him as I disengage my hook. I
                    invariably fall in and get half-drowned when I wade, there being an
                    insufficiency of nails in the soles of my brogues. My waders let in water, too,
                    and when I go out to fish I usually leave either my reel, or my flies, or my
                    rod, at home. Perhaps no other man's average of lost flies in proportion to
                    taken trout was ever so great as mine. I lose plenty, by striking furiously,
                    after a series of short rises, and breaking the gut, with which the fish swims
                    away. As to dressing a fly, one would sooner think of dressing a dinner. The
                    result of the fly-dressing would resemble a small blacking-brush, perhaps, but
                    nothing entomological.</p>

                <p>Then why, a persevering reader may ask, do I <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0028"
                        n="5"/> fish? Well, it is stronger than myself, the love of fishing; perhaps
                    it is an inherited instinct, without the inherited power. I may have had a
                    fishing ancestor who bequeathed to me the passion without the art. My vocation
                    is fixed, and I have fished to little purpose all my days. Not for salmon, an
                    almost fabulous and yet a stupid fish, which must be moved with a rod like a
                    weaver's beam. The trout is more delicate and dainty--not the sea-trout, which
                    any man, woman, or child can capture, but the yellow trout in clear water.</p>

                <p>A few rises are almost all I ask for: to catch more than half a dozen fish does
                    not fall to my lot twice a year. Of course, in a Sutherland loch one man is as
                    good as another, the expert no better than the duffer. The fish will take, or
                    they won't. If they won't, nobody can catch them; if they will, nobody can miss
                    them. It is as simple as trolling a minnow from a boat in Loch Leven, probably
                    the lowest possible form of angling. My ambition is as great as my skill is
                    feeble; to capture big trout with the dry fly in the Test, that would content
                    me, and nothing under that. But <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0029" n="6"/> I can't
                    see the natural fly on the water; I cannot see my own fly,</p>

                <lg type="line">
                    <l>Let it sink or let it swim.</l>
                </lg>

                <p>I often don't see the trout rise to me, if he is such a fool as to rise; and I
                    can't strike in time when I do see him. Besides, I am unteachable to tie any of
                    the orthodox knots in the gut; it takes me half an hour to get the gut through
                    one of these newfangled iron eyes, and, when it is through, I knot it any way.
                    The "jam" knot is a name to me, and no more. That, perhaps, is why the hooks
                    crack off so merrily. Then, if I do spot a rising trout, and if he does not spot
                    me as I crawl like the serpent towards him, my fly always fixes in a nettle, a
                    haycock, a rose-bush, or whatnot, behind me. I undo it, or break it, and put up
                    another, make a cast, and, "plop," all the line falls in with a splash that
                    would frighten a crocodile. The fish's big black fin goes cutting the stream
                    above, and there is a <hi rend="italic">sauve qui peut</hi> of trout in all
                    directions.</p>

                <p>I once did manage to make a cast correctly: the fly went over the fish's nose; he
                    rose; I hooked <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0030" n="7"/> him, and he was a great
                    silly brute of a grayling. The grayling is the deadest-hearted and the
                    foolishest-headed fish that swims. I would as lief catch a perch or an eel as a
                    grayling. This is the worst of it--this ambition of the duffer's, this desire
                    for perfection, as if the golfing imbecile should match himself against Mr.
                    Horace Hutchinson, or as the sow of the Greek proverb challenged Athene to sing.
                    I know it all, I deplore it, I regret the evils of ambition; but <hi
                        rend="italic">c'est plus fort que moi</hi>. If there is a trout rising well
                    under the pendant boughs that trail in the water, if there is a brake of briars
                    behind me, a strong wind down stream, for that trout, in that impregnable
                    situation, I am impelled to fish. If I raise him I strike, miss him, catch up in
                    his tree, swish the cast off into the briars, break my top, break my heart,
                    but--that is the humour of it. The passion, or instinct, being in all senses
                    blind, must no doubt be hereditary. It is full of sorrow and bitterness and hope
                    deferred, and entails the mockery of friends, especially of the fair. But I
                    would as soon lay down a love of books as a love of fishing.</p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0031" n="8"/>

                <p>Success with pen or rod may be beyond one, but there is the pleasure of the
                    pursuit, the rapture of endeavour, the delight of an impossible chase, the joys
                    of nature--sky, trees, brooks, and birds. Happiness in these things is the
                    legacy to us of the barbarian. Man in the future will enjoy bricks, asphalte,
                    fog, machinery, "society," even picture galleries, as many men and most women do
                    already. We are fortunate who inherit the older, not "the new spirit"--we who,
                    skilled or unskilled, follow in the steps of our father, Izaak, by streams less
                    clear, indeed, and in meadows less fragrant, than his. Still, they are meadows
                    and streams, not wholly dispeopled yet of birds and trout; nor can any defect of
                    art, nor certainty of laborious disappointment, keep us from the waterside when
                    April comes.</p>

                <p>Next to being an expert, it is well to be a contented duffer: a man who would
                    fish if he could, and who will pleasure himself by flicking off his flies, and
                    dreaming of impossible trout, and smoking among the sedges Hope's enchanted
                    cigarettes. Next time we shall be more skilled, more fortunate. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0032" n="9"/> Next time! "To-morrow, and to-morrow,
                    and to-morrow." Grey hairs come, and stiff limbs, and shortened sight; but the
                    spring is green and hope is fresh for all the changes in the world and in
                    ourselves. We can tell a hawk from a hand-saw, a March Brown from a Blue Dun;
                    and if our success be as poor as ever, our fancy can dream as well as ever of
                    better things and more fortunate chances. For fishing is like life; and in the
                    art of living, too, there are duffers, though they seldom give us their
                    confessions. Yet even they are kept alive, like the incompetent angler, by this
                    undying hope: they will be more careful, more skilful, more lucky next time. The
                    gleaming untravelled future, the bright untried waters, allure us from day to
                    day, from pool to pool, till, like the veteran on Coquet side, we "try a
                    farewell throw," or, like Stoddart, look our last on Tweed.</p>

                <head>A BORDER BOYHOOD</head>

                <p>A fisher, says our father Izaak, is like a poet: he "must be born so." The
                    majority of dwellers on the Border are born to be fishers, thanks to the endless
                    number of rivers and burns in the region between the Tweed and the Coquet--a
                    realm where almost all trout-fishing is open, and where, since population and
                    love of the sport have increased, there is now but little water that merits the
                    trouble of putting up a rod.</p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0034" n="11"/>

                <p>Like the rest of us in that country, I was born an angler, though under an evil
                    star, for, indeed, my labours have not been blessed, and are devoted to fishing
                    rather than to the catching of fish. Remembrance can scarcely recover, "nor time
                    bring back to time," the days when I was not busy at the waterside; yet the feat
                    is not quite beyond the power of Mnemosyne. My first recollection of the sport
                    must date from about the age of four. I recall, in a dim brightness, driving
                    along a road that ran between banks of bracken and mica-veined rocks, and the
                    sunlight on a shining bend of a highland stream, and my father, standing in the
                    shallow water, showing me a huge yellow fish, that gave its last fling or two on
                    the grassy bank. The fish seemed as terrible and dangerous to me as to Tobit, in
                    the Apocrypha, did that ferocious half-pounder which he carries on a string in
                    the early Italian pictures. How oddly Botticelli and his brethren misconceived
                    the man-devouring fish, which must have been a crocodile strayed from the Nile
                    into the waters of the Euphrates! A half- pounder! To have been terrified by a
                    trout <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0035" n="12"/> seems a bad beginning; and,
                    thereafter, the mist gather's over the past, only to lift again when I see
                    myself, with a crowd of other little children, sent to fish, with crooked pins,
                    for minnows, or "baggies" as we called them, in the Ettrick. If our parents
                    hoped that we would bring home minnows for bait, they were disappointed. The
                    party was under the command of a nursery governess, and probably she was no
                    descendant of the mother of us all, Dame Juliana Berners. We did not catch any
                    minnows, and I remember sitting to watch a bigger boy, who was angling in a
                    shoal of them when a parr came into the shoal, and we had bright visions of
                    alluring that monarch of the deep. But the parr disdained our baits, and for
                    months I dreamed of what it would have been to capture him, and <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0036" n="13"/> often thought of him in church. In a
                    moment of profane confidence my younger brother once asked me: "What do <hi
                        rend="italic">you</hi> do in sermon time? I," said he in a whisper--"mind
                    you don't tell--<hi rend="italic">I</hi> tell stories to myself about catching
                    trout." To which I added similar confession, for even so I drove the sermon by,
                    and I have not "told"--till now.</p>

                <p>By this time we must have been introduced to trout. Who forgets his first trout?
                    Mine, thanks to that unlucky star, was a double deception, or rather there were
                    two kinds of deception. A village carpenter very kindly made rods for us. They
                    were of unpainted wood, these first rods; they were in two pieces, with a real
                    brass joint, and there was a ring at the end of the top joint, to which the line
                    was knotted. We were still in the age of Walton, who clearly knew nothing,
                    except by hearsay, of a reel; he abandons the attempt to describe that machine
                    as used by the salmon-fishers. He thinks it must be seen to be understood. With
                    these innocent weapons, and with the gardener to bait our hooks, we were taken
                    to the Yarrow, far up the stream, near Ladhope. <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0037"
                        n="14"/> How well one remembers deserting the gardener, and already
                    appreciating the joys of having no gillie nor attendant, of being "alone with
                    ourselves and the goddess of fishing"! I cast away as well as I could, and
                    presently jerked a trout, a tiny one, high up in the air out of the water. But
                    he fell off the hook again, he dropped in with a little splash, and I rushed up
                    to consult my tutor on his unsportsmanlike behaviour, and the disappointing,
                    nay, heart-breaking, occurrence. Was the trout not morally caught, was there no
                    way of getting him to see this and behave accordingly? The gardener feared there
                    was none. Meanwhile he sat on the bank and angled in a pool. "Try my rod," he
                    said, and, as soon as I had taken hold of it, "pull up," he <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0038" n="15"/> cried, "pull up." I did "pull up," and
                    hauled my first troutling on shore. But in my inmost heart I feared that he was
                    not my trout at all, that the gardener had hooked him before he handed the rod
                    to me. Then we met my younger brother coming to us with quite a great fish, half
                    a pound perhaps, which he had caught in a burn. Then, for the first time, my
                    soul knew the fierce passion of jealousy, the envy of the angler. Almost for the
                    last time, too; for, I know not why it is, and it proves me no true fisherman, I
                    am not discontented by the successes of others. If one cannot catch fish
                    oneself, surely the next best thing is to see other people catch them.</p>

                <p>My own progress was now checked for long by a constitutional and insuperable
                    aversion to angling with worm. If the gardener, or a pretty girl-cousin of the
                    mature age of fourteen, would put the worm on, I did not "much mind" fishing
                    with it. Dost thou remember, fair lady of the ringlets? Still, I never liked
                    bait-fishing, and these mine allies were not always at hand. We used, indeed, to
                    have great days with perch at Faldonside, <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0039"
                        n="16"/> on the land which Sir Walter Scott was always so anxious to buy
                    from Mr. Nichol Milne. Almost the last entry in his diary, at Naples, breathes
                    this unutterable hope. He had deluded himself into believing that his debts were
                    paid, and that he could soon "speak a word to young Nichol Milne." The word, of
                    course, was never spoken, and the unsupplanted laird used to let us fish for his
                    perch to our hearts' desire. Never was <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0040" n="17"/>
                    there such slaughter. The corks which we used as floats were perpetually
                    tipping, bobbing, and disappearing, and then the red-finned perch would fly out
                    on to dry land. Here I once saw two corks go down, two anglers haul up, and one
                    perch, attached to both hooks, descend on the grassy bank. My brother and I
                    filled two baskets once, and strung dozens of other perch on a stick.</p>

                <p>But this was not legitimate business. Not till we came to fly-fishing were we
                    really entered at the sport, and this initiation took place, as it chanced,
                    beside the very stream where I was first shown a trout. It is a charming piece
                    of water, amber-coloured and clear, flowing from the Morvern hills under the
                    limes of an ancient avenue--trees that have long survived the house to which, of
                    old, the road must have led. Our gillie put on for us big bright sea-trout
                    flies--nobody fishes there for yellow trout; but, in our inexperience, small
                    "brownies" were all we caught. Probably we were only taken to streams and
                    shallows where we could not interfere with mature sportsmen. At all events, it
                    was demonstrated to us that we could <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0041" n="18"/>
                    actually catch fish with fly, and since then I have scarcely touched a worm,
                    except as a boy, in burns. In these early days we had no notion of playing a
                    trout. If there was a bite, we put our strength into an answering tug, and, if
                    nothing gave way, the trout flew over our heads, perhaps up into a tree, perhaps
                    over into a branch of the stream behind us. Quite a large trout will yield to
                    this artless method, if the rod be sturdy--none of your glued-up cane-affairs. I
                    remember hooking a trout which, not answering to the first haul, ran right
                    across the stream and made for a hole in the opposite bank. But the second lift
                    proved successful and he landed on my side of the water. He had a great minnow
                    in his throat, and must have been a particularly greedy animal. Of course, on
                    this system there were many breakages, and the method was abandoned as we lived
                    into our teens, and began to wade and to understand something about fly-fishing.</p>

                <p>It was worth while to be a boy then in the south of Scotland, and to fish the
                    waters haunted by old legends, musical with old songs, and renowned <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0042" n="19"/> in the sporting essays of Christopher
                    North and Stoddart. Even then, thirty long years ago, the old stagers used to
                    tell us that "the waiter was owr sair fished," and they grumbled about the
                    system of draining the land, which makes a river a roaring torrent in floods,
                    and a bed of grey stones with a few clear pools and shallows, during the rest of
                    the year. In times before the hills were drained, before the manufacturing towns
                    were so populous, before pollution, netting, dynamiting, poisoning, sniggling,
                    and the enormous increase of fair and unfair fishing, the border must have been
                    the angler's paradise. Still, it was not bad when we were boys. We had Ettrick
                    within a mile of us, and a finer natural trout-stream there is not in Scotland,
                    though now the water only holds a sadly persecuted remnant. There was one long
                    pool behind Lindean, flowing beneath a high wooded bank, where the trout
                    literally seemed never to cease rising at the flies that dropped from the
                    pendant boughs. Unluckily the water flowed out of the pool in a thin broad
                    stream, directly it right angles to the pool itself. Thus the angler <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0043" n="20"/> had, so to speak, the whole of lower
                    Ettrick at his back when he waded: it was a long way up stream to the bank, and,
                    as we never used landing-nets then, we naturally lost a great many trout in
                    trying to unhook them in mid water. They only averaged as a rule from three to
                    two to the pound, but they were strong and lively. In this pool there was a
                    large tawny, table- shaped stone, over which the current broke. Out of the eddy
                    behind this stone, one of my brothers one day caught three trout weighing over
                    seven pounds, a feat which nowadays sounds quite incredible. As soon as the
                    desirable eddy was empty, another trout, a trifle smaller than the former, seems
                    to have occupied it. The next mile and a half, from Lindean to the junction with
                    Tweed, was remarkable for excellent sport. In the last pool of Ettrick, the
                    water flowed by a steep bank, and, if you cast almost on to the further side,
                    you were perfectly safe to get fish, even when the river was very low. The flies
                    used, three on a cast, were small and dusky, hare's ear and woodcock wing, black
                    palmers, or, as Stoddart sings,</p>

                </lg>

                <p>Next to Ettrick came Tweed: the former river joins the latter at the bend of a
                    long stretch of water, half stream, half pool, in which angling was always good.
                    In late September there were sea-trout, which, for some reason, rose to the fly
                    much more freely than sea-trout do now in the upper Tweed. I particularly
                    remember hooking one just under the railway bridge. He was a two-pounder, and
                    practised the usual sea-trout tactics of springing into the air like a rocket.
                    There was a knot on my line, of course, and I was obliged to hold him hard. When
                    he had been dragged up on the shingle, the line parted, broken in twain at the
                    knot; but it had lasted just long enough, during three exciting minutes. This
                    accident of a knot on the line has only once befallen me since, with the
                    strongest loch-trout I ever encountered. It was on Branxholme Loch, where the
                    trout run to a great size, but usually refuse the fly. I was alone in a boat on
                    a windy day; the trout soon ran out the line to the knot, and then there was
                    nothing for it <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0047" n="22"/> but to lower the top
                    almost to the water's edge, and hold on in hope. Presently the boat drifted
                    ashore, and I landed him--better luck than I deserved. People who only know the
                    trout of the Test and other chalk streams, cannot imagine how much stronger are
                    the fish of the swift Scottish streams and dark Scottish lochs. They're worse
                    fed, but they are infinitely more powerful and active; it is all the difference
                    between an alderman and a clansman.</p>

                <p>Tweed, at this time, was full of trout, but even then they were not easy to
                    catch. One difficulty lay in the nature of the wading. There is a pool near
                    Ashiesteil and Gleddis Weil which illustrated this. Here Scott and Hogg were
                    once upset from a boat while "burning the water"--spearing salmon by torchlight.
                    Herein, too, as Scott mentions in his Diary, he once caught two trout at one
                    cast. The pool is long, is paved with small gravel, and allures you to wade on
                    and on. But the water gradually deepens as you go forward, and the pool ends in
                    a deep pot under each bank. Then to recover your ground becomes by <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0048" n="23"/> no means easy, especially if the water
                    is heavy. You get half-drowned, or drowned altogether, before you discover your
                    danger. Many of the pools have this peculiarity, and in many, one step made
                    rashly lets you into a very uncomfortable and perilous place. Therefore
                    expeditions to Tweedside were apt to end in a ducking. It was often hard to
                    reach the water where trout were rising, and the rise was always capricious.
                    There might not be a stir on the water for hours, and suddenly it would be all
                    boiling with heads and tails for twenty minutes, after which nothing was to be
                    done. To miss "the take" was to waste the day, at least in fly-fishing. From a
                    high wooded bank I have seen the trout feeding, and they have almost ceased to
                    feed before I reached the waterside. Still worse was it to be allured into water
                    over the tops of your waders, early in the day, and then to find that the rise
                    was over, and there was nothing for it but a weary walk home, the basket laden
                    only with damp boots. Still, the trout were undeniably <hi rend="italic"
                    >there</hi>, and that was a great encouragement. They are there still, but
                    infinitely <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0049" n="24"/> more cunning than of old.
                    Then, if they were feeding, they took the artificial fly freely; now it must be
                    exactly of the right size and shade or they will have none of it. They come
                    provokingly short, too; just plucking at the hook, and running out a foot of
                    line or so, then taking their departure. For some reason the Tweed is more
                    difficult to fish with the dry fly than--the Test, for example. The water is
                    swifter and very dark, it drowns the fly soon, and on the surface the fly is
                    less easily distinguished than at Whitchurch, in the pellucid streams. The
                    Leader a tributary, may be fished with dry fly; on the Tweed one can hardly
                    manage it. There is a plan by which rising trout may be taken--namely, by
                    baiting with a small red worm and casting as in fly-fishing. But that is so hard
                    on the worm! Probably he who can catch trout with fly on the Tweed between
                    Melrose and Holy Lee can catch them anywhere. On a good day in April great
                    baskets are still made in preserved parts of the Tweed, but, if they are made in
                    open water, it must be, I fancy, with worm, or with the "screw," the lava of the
                    May- fly. The <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0050" n="25"/> screw is a hideous and
                    venomous-looking animal, which is fixed on a particular kind of tackle, and cast
                    up stream with a short line. The heaviest trout are fond of it, but it can only
                    be used at a season when either school or Oxford keeps one far from what old
                    Franck, Walton's contemporary, a Cromwellian trooper, calls "the glittering and
                    resolute streams of Tweed."</p>

                <p>Difficult as it is, that river is so beautiful and alluring that it scarcely
                    needs the attractions of sport. The step banks, beautifully wooded, and in
                    spring one mass of primroses, are crowned here <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0051"
                        n="26"/> and there with ruined Border towers--like Elibank, the houses of
                    Muckle Mou'ed Meg; or with fair baronial houses like Fernilea. Meg made a bad
                    exchange when she left Elibank with the salmon pool at its foot for bleak
                    Harden, frowning over the narrow "den" where Harden kept the plundered cattle.
                    There is no fishing in the tiny Harden burn, that joins the brawling Borthwick
                    Water.</p>

                <p>The burns of the Lowlands are now almost barren of trout. The spawning fish,
                    flabby and useless, are killed in winter. All through the rest of the year, in
                    the remotest places, tourists are hard at them with worm. In a small burn a
                    skilled wormer may almost depopulate the pools, and, on the Border, all is fish
                    that comes to the hook; men keep the very fingerlings, on the pretext that they
                    are "so sweet" in the frying-pan. The crowd of anglers in glens which seem not
                    easily accessible is provoking enough. Into the Meggat, a stream which feeds St.
                    Mary's Loch, there flows the Glengaber, or Glencaber burn: the burn of the
                    pine-tree stump. The water runs in <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0052" n="27"/>
                    deep pools and streams over a blue slatey rock, which contains gold under the
                    sand, in the worn holes and crevices. My friend, Mr. McAllister, the
                    schoolmaster at St. Mary's, tells me that one day, when fish were not rising, he
                    scooped out the gravel of one of these holes with his knife, and found a tiny
                    nugget, after which the gold-hunting fever came on him for a while. But little
                    is got <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0053" n="28"/> nowadays, though in some
                    earlier period the burn has been diverted from its bed, and the people used
                    solemnly to wash the sand, as in California or Australia. Well, whether in
                    consequence of the gold, as the alchemical philosophers would have held, or not,
                    the trout of the Glengaber burn were good. They were far shorter, thicker and
                    stronger than those of the many neighbouring brooks. I have fished up the burn
                    with fly, when it was very low, hiding carefully behind the boulders, and have
                    been surprised at the size and gameness of the fish. As soon as the fly had
                    touched the brown water, it was sucked down, and there was quite a fierce little
                    fight before the fish came to hand.</p>

                <p>"This, all this, was in the olden time, long ago."</p>

                <p>The Glengaber burn is about twenty miles from any railway station, but, on the
                    last occasion when I visited it, three louts were worming their way up it,
                    within twenty yards of each other, each lout, with his huge rod, showing himself
                    wholly to any trout that might be left in the water. Thirty years ago the burns
                    that feed St. Mary's Loch were almost unfished, and rare sport we had in them,
                    as boys,

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0058" n="29"/>staying at Tibbie Sheil's famous
                    cottage, and sleeping in her box-beds, where so often the Ettrick Shepherd and
                    Christopher North have lain, after copious toddy. "'Tis gone, 'tis gone:" not in
                    our time will any man, like the Ettrick Shepherd, need a cart to carry the trout
                    he has slain in Meggat Water. That stream, flowing through a valley furnished
                    with a grass-grown track for a road, flows, as I said, into St. Mary's Loch.
                    There are two or three large pools at the foot of the loch, in which, as a small
                    boy hardly promoted to fly, I have seen many monsters rising greedily. Men got
                    into the way of fishing these pools after a flood with minnow, and thereby made
                    huge baskets, the big fish running up to feed, out of the loch. But, when last I
                    rowed past Meggat foot, the delta of that historic stream was simply crowded
                    with anglers, stepping in in front of each other. I asked if this mob was a
                    political "demonstration," but they stuck to business, as if they had been on
                    the Regent's Canal. And this, remember, was twenty miles from any town! Yet
                    there is a burn on the Border still undiscovered, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0059" n="30"/> still full of greedy trout. I shall
                    give the angler such a hint of its whereabouts as Tiresias, in Hades, gave to
                    Odysseus concerning the end of his second wanderings.</p>

                <p>When, O stranger, thou hast reached a burn where the shepherd asks thee for the
                    newspaper wrapped round thy sandwiches, that he may read the news, then erect an
                    altar to Priapus, god of fishermen, and begin to angle boldly.</p>

                <p>Probably the troops who fish our Border-burns still manage to toss out some
                    dozens of tiny fishes, <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0060" n="31"/> some six or
                    eight to the pound. Are not these triumphs chronicled in the "Scotsman?" But
                    they cannot imagine what angling was in the dead years, nor what great trout
                    dwelt below the linns of the Crosscleugh burn, beneath the red clusters of the
                    rowan trees, or in the waters of the "Little Yarrow" above the Loch of the
                    Lowes. As to the lochs themselves, now that anyone may put a boat on them, now
                    that there is perpetual trolling, as well as fly-fishing, so that every fish
                    knows the lures, the fun is mainly over. In April, no doubt, something may still
                    be done, and in the silver twilights of June, when as you drift on the still
                    surface you hear the constant sweet plash of the rising trout, a few, and these
                    good, may be taken. But the water wants re-stocking, and the burns in winter
                    need watching, in the interests of spawning fish. It is nobody's interest, that
                    I know of, to take trouble and incur expense; and free fishing, by the
                    constitution of the universe, must end in bad fishing or in none at all. The
                    best we can say for it is that vast numbers of persons may, by the still waters
                    of these meres, enjoy the pleasures of hope. Even <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0061" n="32"/> solitude is no longer to be found in
                    the scene which Scott, in "Marmion," chooses as of all places the most solitary.</p>

                    peace returns; and only if the golden age is born again, and if we revive in it,
                    shall we find St. Mary's what St. Mary's was lang syne--</p>

                    great reputation, and some good trout are still taken in the upper waters, and
                    there must be monsters in the deep black pools, the "dowie dens" above Bowhill.
                    But I never had any luck there. The choicest stream of all was then, probably,
                    the Aill, described by Sir Walter in "William of Deloraine's Midnight Ride"--</p>

                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>Where Aill, from mountains freed,</l>
                    <l>Down from the lakes did raving come;</l>
                    <l>Each wave was crested with tawny foam,</l>
                    <l>Like the mane of a chestnut steed.</l>
                </lg>

                <p>As not uncommonly happens, Scott uses rather large language here. The steepy,
                    grassy hillsides, the great green tablelands in a recess of which the Aill is
                    born, can hardly be called "mountains." The "lakes," too, through which it
                    passes, are much more like tarns, or rather, considering the flatness of their
                    banks, like well-meaning ponds. But the Aill, near Sinton and Ashkirk, was a
                    delightful trout-stream, between its willow- fringed banks, a brook about the
                    size of the Lambourne. Nowhere on the Border were trout more numerous, better
                    fed, <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0065" n="34"/> and more easily beguiled. A week
                    on Test would I gladly give for one day of boyhood beside the Aill, where the
                    casting was not scientific, but where the fish rose gamely at almost any fly.
                    Nobody seemed to go there then, and, I fancy, nobody need go there now. The nets
                    and other dismal devices of the poachers from the towns have ruined that
                    pleasant brook, where one has passed so many a happy hour, walking the long way
                    home wet and weary, but well content. Into Aill flows a burn, the Headshaw burn,
                    where there used to be good fish, because it runs out of Headshaw Loch, a
                    weed-fringed lonely tarn on the bleak level of the tableland. Bleak as it may
                    seem, Headshaw Loch has the great charm of absolute solitude: there are no
                    tourists nor anglers here, and the life of the birds is especially free and
                    charming. The trout, too, are large, pink of flesh, and game of character; but
                    the world of mankind need not rush thither. They are not to be captured by the
                    wiles of men, or so rarely that the most enthusiastic anglers have given them
                    up. They are as safe in their tarn as those enchanted fish of the "Arabian
                    Nights." <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0066" n="35"/> Perhaps a silver sedge in a
                    warm twilight may somewhat avail, but the adventure is rarely achieved.</p>

                <p>These are the waters with which our boyhood was mainly engaged; it is a pleasure
                    to name and number them. Memory, that has lost so much and would gladly lose so
                    much more, brings vividly back the golden summer evenings by Tweedside, when the
                    trout began to plash in the stillness--brings back the long, lounging, solitary
                    days beneath the woods of Ashiesteil--days so lonely that they sometimes, in the
                    end, begat a superstitious eeriness. One seemed forsaken in an enchanted world;
                    one might see the two white fairy deer flit by, bringing to us, as to Thomas
                    Rhymer, the tidings that we must back to Fairyland. Other waters we knew well,
                    and loved: the little salmon-stream in the west that doubles through the loch,
                    and runs a mile or twain beneath its alders, past its old Celtic battle-field,
                    beneath the ruined shell of its feudal tower, to the sea. Many a happy day we
                    had there, on loch or stream, with the big sea-trout which have somehow changed
                    their tastes, and to- <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0067" n="36"/> day take quite
                    different flies from the green body and the red body that led them to the
                    landing-net long ago. Dear are the twin Alines, but dearer is Tweed, and
                    Ettrick, where our ancestor was drowned in a flood, and his white horse was
                    found, next day, feeding near his dead body, on a little grassy island. There is
                    a great pleasure in trying new methods, in labouring after the delicate art of
                    the dry fly-fisher in the clear Hampshire streams, where the glassy tide flows
                    over the waving tresses of crow's-foot below the poplar shade. But nothing can
                    be so good as what is old, and, as far as angling goes, is practically ruined,
                    the alternate pool and stream of the Border waters, where</p>

                </lg>

                <p>and the salmon cast murmurs hard by the Wizard's grave. They are all gone now,
                    the old allies and tutors in the angler's art--the kind gardener who baited our
                    hooks; the good Scotch judge who gave us our first collection of flies; the
                    friend who took us with him on his salmon- fishing expedition, and made men of
                    us with real rods, and "pirns" of ancient <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0068"
                        n="37"/> make. The companions of those times are scattered, and live under
                    strange stars and in converse seasons, by troutless waters. It is no longer the
                    height of pleasure to be half-drowned in Tweed, or lost on the hills with no
                    luncheon in the basket. But, except for scarcity of fish, the scene is very
                    little altered, and one is a boy again, in heart, beneath the elms of Yair, or
                    by the Gullets at Ashiesteil. However bad the sport, it keeps you young, or
                    makes you young again, and you need not follow Ponce de Leon to the western
                    wilderness, when, in any river you knew of yore, you can find the Fountain of
                    Youth.</p>

                    <p>Good trout-fishing in Scotland, south of the Pentland Firth, is almost
                        impossible to procure. There are better fish, and more of them, in the
                        Wandle, within twenty minutes of Victoria Station, than in any equal stretch
                        of any Scotch river with which I am acquainted. But the pleasure of angling,
                        luckily, does not consist merely of the catching of fish. The Wandle is
                        rather too suburban for some tastes, which prefer smaller trout, better air,
                        and wilder <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0070" n="39"/> scenery. To such
                        spirits, Loch Awe may, with certain distinct cautions, be recommended. There
                        is more chance for anglers, now, in Scotch lochs than in most Scotch rivers.
                        The lochs cannot so easily be netted, lined, polluted, and otherwise made
                        empty and ugly, like the Border streams. They are farther off from towns and
                        tourists, though distance is scarcely a complete protection. The best lochs
                        for yellow trout are decidedly those of Sutherland. There are no railways,
                        and there are two hundred lochs and more in the Parish of Assynt. There, in
                        June, the angler who is a good pedestrian may actually enjoy solitude,
                        sometimes. There is a loch near Strathnaver, and far from human habitations,
                        where a friend of my own recently caught sixty- five trout weighing about
                        thirty-eight pounds. They are numerous and plucky, but not large, though a
                        casual big loch-trout may be taken by trolling. But it is truly a far way to
                        this anonymous lake and all round the regular fishing inns, like Inchnadampf
                        and Forsinard there is usually quite a little crowd of anglers. The sport is
                        advertised in <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0071" n="40"/> the newspapers; more
                        and more of our eager fellow-creatures are attracted, more and more the
                        shooting tenants are preserving waters that used to be open. The distance to
                        Sutherland makes that county almost beyond the range of a brief holiday.
                        Loch Leven is nearer, and at Loch Leven the scenery is better than its
                        reputation, while the trout are excellent, though shy. But Loch Leven is too
                        much cockneyfied by angling competitions; moreover, its pleasures are
                        expensive. Loch Awe remains, a loch at once large, lovely, not too distant,
                        and not destitute of sport.</p>

                    <p>The reader of Mr. Colquhoun's delightful old book, "The Moor and the Loch,"
                        must not expect Loch Awe to be what it once was. The railway, which has made
                        the north side of the lake so ugly, has brought the district within easy
                        reach of Glasgow and of Edinburgh. Villas are built on many a beautiful
                        height; here couples come for their honeymoon, here whole argosies of boats
                        are anchored off the coasts, here do steam launches ply. The hotels are
                        extremely comfortable, the boatmen are excellent boatmen, good fishers, and
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0072" n="41"/> capital company. All this is
                        pleasant, but all this attracts multitudes of anglers, and it is not in
                        nature that sport should be what it once was. Of the famous <hi
                            rend="italic">salmo ferox</hi> I cannot speak from experience. The huge
                        courageous fish is still at home in Loch Awe, but now he sees a hundred
                        baits, natural and artificial, where he saw one in Mr. Colquhoun's time. The
                        truly contemplative man may still sit in the stern of the boat, with two
                        rods out, and possess his soul in patience, as if he were fishing for tarpon
                        in Florida. I wish him luck, but the diversion is little to my mind. Except
                        in playing the fish, if he comes, all the skill is in the boatmen, who know
                        where to row, at what pace, and in what depth of water. As to the chances of
                        salmon again, they are perhaps less rare, but they are not very frequent.
                        The fish does not seem to take freely in the loch, and on his way from the
                        Awe to the Orchy. As to the trout-fishing, it is very bad in the months when
                        most men take their holidays, August and September. From the middle of April
                        to the middle of June is apparently the best time. The loch is <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0073" n="42"/> well provided with bays, of
                        different merit, according to the feeding which they provide; some come
                        earlier, some later into season. Doubtless the most beautiful part of the
                        lake is around the islands, between the Loch Awe and the Port Sonachan
                        hotels. The Green Island, with its strange Celtic burying-ground, where the
                        daffodils bloom among the sepulchres with their rude carvings of battles and
                        of armed men, has many trout around its shores. The favourite
                        fishing-places, however, are between Port Sonachan and Ford. In the morning
                        early, the steam-launch tows a fleet of boats down the loch, and they drift
                        back again, fishing all the bays, and arriving at home in time for dinner.
                        Too frequently the angler is vexed by finding a boat busy in his favourite
                        bay. I am not sure that, when the trout are really taking, the water near
                        Port Sonachan is not as good as any other. Much depends on the weather. In
                        the hard north-east winds of April we can scarcely expect trout to feed very
                        freely anywhere. These of Loch Awe are very peculiar fish. I take it that
                        there are two species--one short, thick, golden, <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0074" n="43"/> and beautiful; but these, at least
                        in April, are decidedly scarce. The common sort is long, lanky, of a dark
                        green hue, and the reverse of lovely. Most of them, however, are excellent
                        at breakfast, pink in the flesh, and better flavoured, I think, than the
                        famous trout of Loch Leven. They are also extremely game for their size; a
                        half-pound trout fights like a pounder. From thirty to forty fish in a day's
                        incessant angling is reckoned no bad basket. In genial May weather, probably
                        the trout average two to the pound, and a pounder or two may be in the dish.
                        But three to the pound is decidedly nearer the average, at least in April.
                        The flies commonly used are larger than what are employed in Loch Leven. A
                        teal wing and red body, a grouse hackle, and the prismatic Heckham Peckham
                        are among the favourites; but it is said that flies no bigger than Tweed
                        flies are occasionally successful. In my own brief experience I have found
                        the trout "dour," occasionally they would rise freely for an hour at noon,
                        or in the evening; but often one passed hours with scarcely a rising fish.
                        This may have been due to the bitterness of the <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0075" n="44"/> weather, or to my own lack of
                        skill. Not that lochs generally require much artifice in the angler. To sink
                        the flies deep, and move them with short jerks, appears, now and then, to be
                        efficacious. There has been some controversy about Loch Awe trouting; this
                        is as favourable a view of the sport as I can honestly give. It is not
                        excellent, but, thanks to the great beauty of the scenery, the many points
                        of view on so large and indented a lake, the charm of the wood and wild
                        flowers, Loch Awe is well worth a visit from persons who do not pitch their
                        hopes too high.</p>

                    <p>Loch Awe would have contented me less had I been less fortunate in my
                        boatman. It is often said that tradition has died out in the Highlands; it
                        is living yet.</p>

                    <p>After three days of north wind and failure, it occurred to me that my boatman
                        might know the local folklore--the fairy tales and traditions. As a rule,
                        tradition is a purely professional part of a guide's stock-in- trade, but
                        the angler who had my barque in his charge proved to be a fresh fountain of
                        legend. His own county is not Argyleshire, but <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0076" n="45"/> Inverness, and we did not deal
                        much in local myth. True, he told me why Loch Awe ceased--like the site of
                        Sodom and Gomorrah--to be a cultivated valley and became a lake, where the
                        trout are small and, externally, green.</p>

                    <p>"Loch Awe was once a fertile valley, and it belonged to an old dame. She was
                        called Dame Cruachan, the same as the hill, and she lived high up on the
                        hillside. Now there was a well on the hillside, and she was always to cover
                        up the well with a big stone before the sun set. But one day she had been
                        working in the valley and she was weary, and she sat down by the path on her
                        way home and fell asleep. And the sun had gone down before she reached the
                        well, and in the night the water broke out and filled all the plain, and
                        what was land is now water." This, then, was the origin of Loch Awe. It is a
                        little like the Australian account of the Deluge. That calamity was produced
                        by a man's showing a woman the mystic turndun, a native sacred toy.
                        Instantly water broke out of the earth and drowned everybody.</p>

                    <p>This is merely a local legend, such as boatmen <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0077" n="46"/> are expected to know. As the green
                        trout utterly declined to rise, I tried the boatman with the Irish story of
                        why the Gruagach Gaire left off laughing, and all about the hare that came
                        and defiled his table, as recited by Mr. Curtin in his "Irish Legends"
                        (Sampson, Low, &amp; Co.). The boatman did not know this fable, but he
                        did know of a red deer that came and spoke to a gentleman. This was a story
                        from the Macpherson country. I give it first in the boatman's words, and
                        then we shall discuss the history of the legend as known to Sir Walter Scott
                        and James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd.</p>

                    <head>THE YARN OF THE BLACK OFFICER</head>


                    <p>"It was about 'the last Christmas of the hundred'--the end of last century.
                        They wanted men for the Black Watch (42nd Highlanders), and the Black
                        Officer, as they called him, was sent to his own country to enlist them.
                        Some he got willingly, and others by force. He promised he would only take
                        them to London, where the King <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0078" n="47"/>
                        wanted to review them, and then let them go home. So they came, though they
                        little liked it, and he was marching them south. Now at night they reached a
                        place where nobody would have halted them except the Black Officer, for it
                        was a great place for ghosts. And they would have run away if they had
                        dared, but they were afraid of him. So some tried to sleep in threes and
                        fours, and some were afraid to sleep, and they sat up round the fire. But
                        the Black Officer, he went some way from the rest, and lay down beneath a
                        tree.</p>

                    <p>"Now as the night wore on, and whiles it would be dark and whiles the moon
                        shone, a man came--they did not know from where--a big red man, and drew up
                        to the fire, and was talking with them. And he asked where the Black Officer
                        was, and they showed him. Now there was one man, Shamus Mackenzie they
                        called him, and he was very curious, and he must be seeing what they did. So
                        he followed the man, and saw him stoop and speak to the officer, but he did
                        not waken; then this individual took the Black Officer by the breast and
                        shook him violently. Then Shamus knew <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0079"
                            n="48"/> who the stranger was, for no man alive durst have done as much
                        to the Black Officer. And there was the Black Officer kneeling to him!</p>

                    <p>"Well, what they said, Shamus could not hear, and presently they walked away,
                        and the Black Officer came back alone.</p>

                    <p>"He took them to England, but never to London, and they never saw the King.
                        He took them to Portsmouth, and they were embarked for India, where we were
                        fighting the French. There was a town we couldn't get into" (Seringapatam?),
                        "and the Black Officer volunteered to make a tunnel under the walls. Now
                        they worked three days, and whether it was the French heard them and let
                        them dig on, or not, any way, on the third day the French broke in on them.
                        They kept sending men into the tunnel, and more men, and still they wondered
                        who was fighting within, and how we could have so large a party in the
                        tunnel; so at last they brought torches, and there was no man alive on our
                        side but the Black Officer, and he had a wall of corpses built up in front
                        of him, and was fighting across it. He had more light to see by <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0080" n="49"/> than the French had, for it was
                        dark behind him, and there would be some light on their side. So at last
                        they brought some combustibles and blew it all up. Three days after that we
                        took the town. Some of our soldiers were sent to dig out the tunnel, and
                        with them was Shamus Mackenzie."</p>

                    <p>"And they never found the Black Officer," I said, thinking of young Campbell
                        in Sekukoeni's fighting koppie.</p>

                    <p>"Oh, yes," said the boatman, "Shamus found the body of the Black Officer, all
                        black with smoke, and he laid him down on a green knoll, and was <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0081" n="50"/> standing over the dead man, and
                        was thinking of how many places they had been in together, and of his own
                        country, and how he wished he was there again. Then the dead man's face
                        moved.</p>

                    <p>"Shamus turned and ran for his life, and he was running till he met some
                        officers, and he told them that the Black Officer's body had stirred. They
                        thought he was lying, but they went off to the place, and one of them had
                        the thought to take a flask of brandy in his pocket. When they came to the
                        lifeless body it stirred again, and with one thing and another they brought
                        him round.</p>

                    <p>"The Black Officer was not himself again for long, and they took him home to
                        his own country, and he lay in bed in his house. And every day a red deer
                        would come to the house, and go into his room and sit on a chair beside the
                        bed, speaking to him like a man.</p>

                    <p>"Well, the Black Officer got better again, and went about among his friends;
                        and once he was driving home from a dinner-party, and Shamus was with him.
                        It was just the last night of the hundred. And on the road they met a man,
                        and <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0082" n="51"/> Shamus knew him--for it was
                        him they had seen by the fire on the march, as I told you at the beginning.
                        The Black Officer got down from his carriage and joined the man, and they
                        walked a bit apart; but Shamus--he was so curious--whatever happened he must
                        see them. And he came within hearing just as they were parting, and he heard
                        the stranger say, 'This is the night.'</p>

                    <p>"'No,' said the Black Officer, 'this night next year.'</p>

                    <p>"So he came back, and they drove home. A year went by, and the Black Officer
                        was seeking through the country for the twelve best men he could find to
                        accompany him to some deer-hunt or the like. And he asked Shamus, but he
                        pretended he was ill--Oh, he was very unwell!--and he could not go, but
                        stayed in bed at home. So the Black Officer chose another man, and he and
                        the twelve set out--the thirteen of them. But they were never seen again."</p>

                    <p>"Never seen again? Were they lost in the snow?"</p>

                    <p>"It did come on a heavy fall, sir."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0083" n="52"/>

                    <p>"But their bodies were found?"</p>

                    <p>"No, sir--though they searched high and low; they are not found, indeed, till
                        this day. It was thought the Black Officer had sold himself and twelve other
                        men, sir."</p>

                    <p>"To the Devil?"</p>

                    <p>"It would be that."</p>

                    <p>For the narrator never mentions our ghostly foe, which produces a solemn
                        effect.</p>

                    <p>This story was absolutely new to me, and much I wished that Mr. Louis
                        Stevenson could have heard it. The blending of the far East with the
                        Highlands reminds one of his "Master of Ballantrae," and what might he not
                        make of that fairy red deer! My boatman, too, told me what Mr. Stevenson
                        says the Highlanders will not tell--the name of the man who committed the
                        murder of which Alan Breck was accused. But this secret I do not intend to
                        divulge.</p>

                    <p>The story of the Black Officer then seemed absolutely unpublished. But when
                        Sir Walter Scott's diary was given to the world in October, 1890, it turned
                        out that he was not wholly ignorant <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0084" n="53"
                        /> of the legend. In 1828 he complains that he has been annoyed by a lady,
                        because he had printed "in the 'Review'" a rawhead and bloody-bones story of
                        her father, Major Macpherson, who was lost in a snowstorm. This Major
                        Macpherson was clearly the Black Officer. Mr. Douglas, the publisher of
                        Scott's diary, discovered that the "Review" mentioned vaguely by Scott was
                        the "Foreign Quarterly," No. I, July, 1827. In an essay on Hoffmann's
                        novels, Sir Walter introduced the tale as told to him in a letter from a
                        nobleman some time deceased, not more distinguished for his love of science
                        than his attachment to literature in all its branches.</p>

                    <p>The tale is too long to be given completely. Briefly, a Captain M., on St.
                        Valentine's day, 1799, had been deer-shooting (at an odd time of the year)
                        in the hills west of D-. He did not return, a terrible snowstorm set in, and
                        finally he and his friends were found dead in a bothy, which the tempest had
                        literally destroyed. Large stones from the walls were found lying at
                        distances of a hundred yards; the wooden uprights were twisted <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0085" n="54"/> like broken sticks. The Captain
                        was lying dead, without his clothes, on the bed; one man was discovered at a
                        distance, another near the Captain. Then it was remembered that, at the same
                        bothy a month before, a shepherd lad had inquired for the Captain, had
                        walked with him for some time, and that, on the officer's return, "a
                        mysterious anxiety hung about him." A fire had also been seen blazing on an
                        opposite height, and when some of the gillies went to the spot, "there was
                        no fire to be seen." On the day when the expedition had started, the Captain
                        was warned of the ill weather, but he said "he <hi rend="italic">must</hi>
                        go." He was an unpopular man, and was accused of getting money by procuring
                        recruits from the Highlands, often by cruel means. "Our informer told us
                        nothing more; he neither told us his own opinion, nor that of the country,
                        but left it to our own notions of the manner in which good and evil is
                        rewarded in this life to suggest the author of the miserable event. He
                        seemed impressed with superstitious awe on the subject, and said, 'There was
                        na the like seen in a' Scotland.' The man is <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0086" n="55"/> far advanced in years and is a
                        schoolmaster in the neighbourhood of Rannoch."</p>

                    <p>Sir Walter says that "the feeling of superstitious awe annexed to the
                        catastrophe could not have been improved by any circumstances of additional
                        horror which a poet could have invented." But is there not something more
                        moving still in the boatman's version: "they were never seen again . . .
                        they were not found indeed till this day"?</p>

                    <p>The folklorist, of course, is eager to know whether the boatman's much more
                        complete and connected narrative is a popular mythical development in the
                        years between 1820 and 1890, or whether the schoolmaster of Rannoch did not
                        tell all he knew. It is unlikely, I think, that the siege of Seringapatam
                        would have been remembered so long in connection with the Black Officer if
                        it had not formed part of his original legend. Meanwhile the earliest
                        printed notice of the event with which I am acquainted, a notice only ten
                        years later than the date of the Major's death in 1799, is <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0087" n="56"/> given by Hogg in "The Spy,"
                        1810-11, pp. 101-3. I offer an abridgment of the narrative.</p>

                    <p>"About the end of last century Major Macpherson and a party of friends went
                        out to hunt on the Grampians between Athole and Badenoch. They were highly
                        successful, and in the afternoon they went into a little bothy, and, having
                        meat and drink, they abandoned themselves to jollity.</p>

                    <p>"During their merry-making a young man entered whose appearance particularly
                        struck and somewhat shocked Macpherson; the stranger beckoned to the Major,
                        and he followed him instantly out of the bothy.</p>

                    <p>"When they parted, after apparently having had some earnest conversation, the
                        stranger was out of sight long before the Major was half-way back, though
                        only twenty yards away.</p>

                    <p>"The Major showed on his return such evident marks of trepidation that the
                        mirth was marred and no one cared to ask him questions.</p>

                    <p>"This was early in the week, and on Friday the Major persuaded his friends to
                        make a second 
                        
                        
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0088" n="Illustration" /> 
                        
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0089" />
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0090" n="57" />
                        expedition to the
                        mountains, from which they never returned.</p>

                    <p>"On a search being made their dead bodies were found in the bothy, some
                        considerably mangled, but some were not marked by any wound.</p>

                    <p>"It was visible that this had not been effected by human agency: the bothy
                        was torn from its foundations and scarcely a vestige left of it, and one
                        huge stone, which twelve men could not have raised, was tossed to a
                        considerable distance.</p>

                    <p>"On this event Scott's beautiful ballad of 'Glenfinlas' is said to have been
                        founded."</p>

                    <p>As will be seen presently, Hogg was wrong about 'Glenfinlas'; the boatman was
                        acquainted with a traditional version of that wild legend. I found another
                        at Rannoch.</p>

                    <p>The Highland fairies are very vampirish. The Loch Awe boatman lives at a spot
                        haunted by a shadowy maiden. Her last appearance was about thirty years ago.
                        Two young men were thrashing corn one morning, when the joint of the flail
                        broke. The owner went to Larichban and entered an <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0091" n="58"/> outhouse to look for a piece of
                        sheepskin wherewith to mend the flail. He was long absent, and his companion
                        went after him. He found him struggling in the arms of a ghostly maid, who
                        had nearly murdered him, but departed on the arrival of his friend. It is
                        not easy to make out what these ghoulish women are--not fairies exactly, nor
                        witches, nor vampires. For example, three shepherds at a lonely sheiling
                        were discoursing of their loves, and it was, "Oh, how happy I should be if
                        Katie were here, or Maggie, or Bessie!" as the case might be. So they would
                        say and so they would wish, and lo! one evening, the three girls came to the
                        door of the hut. So they made them welcome; but one of the shepherds was
                        playing the Jew's-harp, and he did not like the turn matters were taking.</p>

                    <p>The two others stole off into corners of the darkling hut with their lovers,
                        but this prudent lad never took his lips off the Jew's-harp.</p>

                    <p>"Harping is good if no ill follows it," said the semblance of his sweetheart;
                        but he never answered. He played and thrummed, and out of one dark corner
                        trickled red blood into the fire-light, <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0092"
                            n="59"/> and out of another corner came a current of blood to meet it.
                        Then he slowly rose, still harping, and backed his way to the door, and fled
                        into the hills from these cruel airy shapes of false desire.</p>

                    <p>"And do the people actually believe all that?"</p>

                    <p>"Ay, do they!"</p>

                    <p>That is the boatman's version of Scott's theme in "Glenfinlas." Witches
                        played a great part in his narratives.</p>

                    <p>In the boatman's country there is a plain, and on the plain is a knoll, about
                        twice the height of a one-storeyed cottage, and pointed "like a sugar-loaf."
                        The old people remember, or have heard, that this mound was not there when
                        they were young. It swelled up suddenly out of the grave of a witch who was
                        buried there.</p>

                    <p>The witch was a great enemy of a shepherd. Every morning she would put on the
                        shape of a hare, and run before his dogs, and lead them away from the sheep.
                        He knew it was right to shoot at her with a crooked sixpence, and he hit her
                        on the hind leg, and the dogs were after her, and chased the hare into the
                        old woman's cottage. The shepherd <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0093" n="60"/>
                        ran after them, and there he found them, tearing at the old woman; but the
                        hare was twisted round their necks, and she was crying, "Tighten, hare,
                        tighten!" and it was choking them. So he tore the hare off the dogs; and
                        then the old woman begged him to save her from them, and she promised never
                        to plague him again. "But if the old dog's teeth had been as sharp as the
                        young one's, she would have been a dead woman."</p>

                    <p>When this witch died she knew she could never lie in safety in her grave; but
                        there was a very safe churchyard in Aberdeenshire, a hundred and fifty miles
                        away, and if she could get into that she would be at rest. And she rose out
                        of her grave, and off she went, and the Devil after her, on a black horse;
                        but, praise to the swiftness of her feet, she won the churchyard before him.
                        Her first grave swelled up, oh, as high as that green hillock!</p>

                    <p>Witches are still in active practice. There was an old woman very miserly.
                        She would alway be taking one of her neighbours' sheep from the hills, and
                        they stood it for long; they did not like to meddle with her. At last it
                        grew so bad that they 
                       
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0094"  />

                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0098" n="61"/> brought her
                        before the sheriff, and she got eighteen months in prison. When she came out
                        she was very angry, and set about making an image of the woman whose sheep
                        she had taken. When the image was made she burned it and put the ashes in a
                        burn. And it is a very curious thing, but the woman she made it on fell into
                        a decline, and took to her bed.</p>

                    <p>The witch and her family went to America. They kept a little inn, in a
                        country place, and people who slept in it did not come out again. They were
                        discovered, and the eldest son was hanged; he confessed that he had
                        committed nineteen murders before he left Scotland.</p>

                    <p>"They were not a nice family."</p>

                    <p>"The father was a very respectable old man."</p>

                    <p>The boatman gave me the name of this wicked household, but it is perhaps
                        better forgotten.</p>

                    <p>The extraordinary thing is that this appears to be the Highland introduction
                        to, or part first of, a gloomy and sanguinary story of a murder hole--an inn
                        of assassins in a lonely district of the United States, which Mr. Louis
                        Stevenson heard in his <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0099" n="62"/> travels
                        there, and told to me some years ago. The details have escaped my memory,
                        but, as Mr. Stevenson narrated them, they rivalled De Quincey's awful story
                        of Williams's murders in the Ratcliffe Highway.</p>

                    <p>Life must still be haunted in Badenoch, as it was on Ida's hill, by forms of
                        unearthly beauty, the goddess or the ghost yet wooing the shepherd; indeed,
                        the boatman told me many stories of living superstition and terrors of the
                        night; but why should I exhaust his wallet? To be sure, it seemed very full
                        of tales; these offered here may be but the legends which came first to his
                        hand. The boatman is not himself a believer in the fairy world, or not more
                        than all sensible men ought to be. The supernatural is too pleasant a thing
                        for us to discard in an earnest, scientific manner like Mr. Kipling's
                        Aurelian McGubben. Perhaps I am more superstitious than the boatman, and the
                        yarns I swopped with him about ghosts I have met would seem even more
                        mendacious to possessors of pocket microscopes and of the modern spirit. But
                        I would rather have one banshee story than fifteen <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0100" n="63"/> pages of proof that "life, which
                        began as a cell, with a c, is to end as a sell, with an s." It should be
                        added that the boatman has given his consent to the printing of his yarns.
                        On being offered a moiety of the profits, he observed that he had no
                        objection to these, but that he entirely declined to be responsible for any
                        share of the expenses. Would that all authors were as sagacious, for then
                        the amateur novelist and the minor poet would vex us no more.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps I should note that I have not made the boatman say "whateffer,"
                        because he doesn't. The occasional use of the imperfect is almost his only
                        Gaelic idiom. It is a great comfort and pleasure, when the trout do not
                        rise, to meet a skilled and unaffected narrator of the old beliefs, old
                        legends, as ancient as the hills that girdle and guard the loch, or as
                        antique, at least, as man's dwelling among the mountains--the Yellow Hill,
                        the Calf Hill, the Hill of the Stack. The beauty of the scene, the pleasant
                        talk, the daffodils on the green isle among the Celtic graves, compensate
                        for a certain "dourness" among the fishes of Loch Awe. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0101" n="64"/> On the occasions when they are not
                        dour they rise very pleasant and free, but, in these brief moments, it is
                        not of legends and folklore that you are thinking, but of the landing-net.
                        The boatman, by the way, was either not well acquainted with <hi
                            rend="italic">Marchen</hi>--Celtic nursery-tales such as Campbell of

                        shyness about narrating this particular sort of old wives' fables which is
                        so common. People who do know them seldom tell them in Sassenach.</p>

                    <p>There is something mysterious in loch-fishing, in the tastes and habits of
                        the fish which inhabit the innumerable lakes and tarns of Scotland. It is
                        not always easy to account either for their presence or their absence, for
                        their numbers or scarcity, their eagerness to take or their "dourness." For
                        example, there is Loch Borlan, close to the well-known little inn of
                        Alt-na-geal-gach in Sutherland. Unless that piece of water is greatly
                        changed, it is simply full of fish of about a quarter of a pound, which will
                        rise at almost any time to almost any fly. There is not much pleasure in
                        catching such tiny and eager trout, but in the season complacent anglers
                        capture and boast of their many dozens. On the other hand, a year or two
                        ago, a beginner <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0103" n="66"/> took a four-pound
                        trout there with the fly. If such trout exist in Borlan, it is hard to
                        explain the presence of the innumerable fry. One would expect the giants of
                        the deep to keep down their population. Not far off is another small lake,
                        Loch Awe, which has invisible advantages over Loch Borlan, yet there the
                        trout are, or were, "fat and fair of flesh," like Tamlane in the ballad.
                        Wherefore are the trout in Loch Tummell so big and strong, from one to five
                        pounds, and so scarce, while those in Loch Awe are numerous and small? One
                        occasionally sees examples of how quickly trout will increase in weight, and
                        what curious habits they will adopt. In a county of south- western Scotland
                        there is a large village, populated by a keenly devoted set of anglers, who
                        miss no opportunity. Within a quarter of a mile of the village is a small
                        tarn, very picturesquely situated among low hills, and provided with the
                        very tiniest feeder and outflow. There is a sluice at the outflow, and, for
                        some reason, the farmer used to let most of the water out, in the summer of
                        every year. In winter the tarn is used by the curling <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0104" n="67"/> club. It is not deep, has rather a
                        marshy bottom, and many ducks, snipe, and wild-fowl generally dwell among
                        the reeds and marish plants of its sides. Nobody ever dreamed of fishing
                        here, but one day a rustic, "glowering" idly over the wall of the adjacent
                        road, saw fish rising. He mentioned his discovery to an angler, who is said
                        to have caught some large trout, but tradition varies about everything,
                        except that the fish are very "dour." One evening in August, a warm, still
                        evening, I happened to visit the tarn. As soon as the sun fell below the
                        hills, it was literally alive with large trout rising. As far as one could
                        estimate from the brief view of heads and shoulders, they were sometimes two
                        or three pounds in weight. I got my rod, of course, as did a rural friend.
                        Mine was a small cane rod, his a salmon-rod. I fished with one Test-fly; he
                        with three large loch-flies. The fish were rising actually at our feet, but
                        they seemed to move about very much, never, or seldom, rising twice exactly
                        at the same place. The hypothesis was started that there were but few of
                        them, and that they ran round and round, <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0105"
                            n="68"/> like a stage army, to give an appearance of multitude. But this
                        appears improbable. What is certain was our utter inability ever to get a
                        rise from the provoking creatures. The dry fly is difficult to use on a
                        loch, as there is no stream to move it, and however gently you draw it it
                        makes a "wake"--a trail behind it. Wet or dry, or "twixt wet and dry," like
                        the convivial person in the song, we could none of us raise them. I did
                        catch a small but beautifully proportioned and pink-fleshed trout with the
                        alder, but everything else, silver sedge and all, everything from midge to
                        May-fly, in the late twilight, was offered to them in vain. In windy or
                        cloudy weather it was just as useless; indeed, I never saw them rise, except
                        in a warm summer stillness, at and after sunset. Probably they would have
                        taken a small red worm, pitched into the ripple of a rise; but we did not
                        try that. After a few evenings, they seemed to give up rising altogether. I
                        don't feel certain that they had not been netted: yet no trout seemed to be
                        on sale in the village. Their presence in the water may perhaps be accounted
                        for thus: they <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0106" n="69"/> may have come into
                        the loch from the river, by way of the tiny feeder; but the river-trout are
                        both scarce and small. A new farmer had given up letting the water off, and
                        probably there must have been very rich feeding, water-shrimps or snails,
                        which might partly account for the refusal to rise at the artificial fly. Or
                        they may have been ottered by the villagers, though that would rather have
                        made them rise short than not rise at all.</p>

                    <p>There is another loch on an extremely remote hillside, eight miles from the
                        smallest town, in a pastoral country. There are trout enough in the loch,
                        and of excellent size and flavour, but you scarcely ever get them. They rise
                        freely, but they <hi rend="italic">always</hi> rise short. It is, I think,
                        the most provoking loch I ever fished. You raise them; they come up freely,
                        showing broad sides of a ruddy gold, like the handsomest Test trout, but
                        they almost invariably miss the hook. You do not land one out of twenty. The
                        reason is, apparently, that people from the nearest town use the otter in
                        the summer evenings, when these trout rise best. In a Sutherland loch, Mr.
                        Edward Moss tells us <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0107" n="70"/> (in "A Season
                        in Sutherland"), that he once found an elegant otter, a well-made engine of
                        some unscrupulous tourist, lying in the bottom of the water on a sunny day.
                        At Loch Skene, on the top of a hill, twenty miles from any town, otters are
                        occasionally found by the keeper or the shepherds, concealed near the shore.
                        The practice of ottering can give little pleasure to any but a depraved
                        mind, and nothing educates trout so rapidly into "rising short"; why they
                        are not to be had when they are rising most vehemently, "to themselves," is
                        another mystery. A few rises are encouraging, but when the water is all
                        splashing with rises, as a rule the angler is only tantalised. A windy day,
                        a day with a large ripple, but without white waves breaking, is, as a rule,
                        best for a loch. In some lochs the sea- trout prefer such a hurricane that a
                        boat can hardly be kept on the water. I have known a strong north wind in
                        autumn put down the sea-trout, whereas the salmon rose, with unusual
                        eagerness, just in the shallows where the waves broke in foam on the shore.
                        The best day I ever had with sea-trout was muggy and grey, <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0108" n="71"/> and the fish were most eager when
                        the water was still, except for a tremendously heavy shower of rain, "a
                        singing shower," as George Chapman has it. On that day two rods caught
                        thirty-nine sea-trout, weighing forty pounds. But it is difficult to say
                        beforehand what day will do well, except that sunshine is bad, a north wind
                        worse, and no wind at all usually means an empty basket. Even to this rule
                        there are exceptions, and one of these is in the case of a tarn which I
                        shall call, pleonastically, Little Loch Beg.</p>

                    <p>This is not the real name of the loch--quite enough people know its real name
                        already. Nor does it seem necessary to mention the district where the loch
                        lies hidden; suffice it to say that a land of more streams and scarcer trout
                        you will hardly find. We had tried all the rivers and burns to no purpose,
                        and the lochs are capricious and overfished. One loch we had not tried, Loch
                        Beg. You walk, or drive, a few miles from any village, then you climb a few
                        hundred yards of hill, and from the ridge you see, on one hand a great
                        amphitheatre of green and purple mountain-sides, <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0109" n="72"/> in the west; on the east, within a
                        hundred yards under a slope, is Loch Beg. It is not a mile in circumference,
                        and all but some eighty yards of shore is defended against the angler by
                        wide beds of water-lilies, with their pretty white floating lamps, or by
                        tall sedges and reeds. Nor is the wading easy. Four steps you make with
                        safety, at the fifth your foremost leg sinks in mud apparently bottomless.
                        Most people fish only the eastern side, whereof a few score yards are open,
                        with a rocky and gravelly bottom.</p>

                    <p>Now, all lochs have their humours. In some trout like a big fly, in some a
                        small one, but almost all do best with a rough wind or rain. I knew enough
                        of Loch Beg to approach it at noon on a blazing day of sunshine, when the
                        surface was like glass. It was like that when first I saw it, and a shepherd
                        warned us that we "would dae naething"; we did little, indeed, but I rose
                        nearly every rising fish I cast over, losing them all, too, and in some
                        cases being broken, as I was using very fine gut, and the fish were heavy.
                        Another trial seemed desirable, and the number of rising <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0110" n="73"/> trout was most tempting. All over
                        it trout were rising to the natural fly, with big circles like those you see
                        in the Test at twilight; while in the centre, where no artificial fly can be
                        cast for want of a boat, a big fish would throw himself out of the water in
                        his eagerness. One such I saw which could not have weighed under three
                        pounds, a short, thick, dark-yellow fish.</p>

                    <p>I was using a light two-handed rod, and fancied that a single Test-fly on
                        very fine tackle would be the best lure. It certainly rose the trout, if one
                        threw into the circle they made; but they never were hooked. One fish of
                        about a pound and a half threw himself out of the water at it, hit it, and
                        broke the fine tackle. So I went on raising them, but never getting them. As
                        long as the sun blazed and no breeze ruffled the water, they rose bravely,
                        but a cloud or even a ripple seemed to send them down.</p>

                    <p>At last I tried a big alder, and with that I actually touched a few, and even
                        landed several on the shelving bank. Their average weight, as we proved on
                        several occasions, was exactly three-quarters <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0111" n="74"/> of a pound; but we never succeeded
                        in landing any of the really big ones.</p>

                    <p>A local angler told me he had caught one of two pounds, and lost another
                        "like a young grilse," after he had drawn it on to the bank. I can easily
                        believe it, for in no loch, but one, have I ever seen so many really big and
                        handsome fish feeding. Loch Beg is within a mile of a larger and famous
                        loch, but it is infinitely better, though the other looks much more
                        favourable in all ways for sport. The only place where fishing is easy, as I
                        have said, is a mere strip of coast under the hill, where there is some
                        gravel, and the mouth of a very tiny feeder, usually dry. Off this place the
                        trout rose freely, but not near so freely as in a certain corner, quite out
                        of reach without a boat, where the leviathans lived and sported.</p>

                    <p>After the little expanse of open shore had been fished over a few times, the
                        trout there seemed to grow more shy, and there was a certain monotony in
                        walking this tiny quarter-deck of space. So I went round to the west side,
                        where the water-lilies are. Fish were rising about three <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002617_0112" n="75"/> yards beyond the weedy beds, and I
                        foolishly thought I would try for them. Now, you cannot overestimate the
                        difficulty of casting a fly across yards of water-lilies. You catch in the
                        weeds as you lift your line for a fresh cast, and then you have to extricate
                        it laboriously, shortening line, and then to let it out again, and probably
                        come to grief once more.</p>

                    <p>I saw a trout rise, with a huge sullen circle dimpling round him, cast over
                        him, raised him, and missed him. The water was perfectly still, and the
                        "plop" made by these fish was very exciting and tantalising. The next that
                        rose took the alder, and, of course, ran right into the broad band of
                        lilies. I tried all the dodges I could think of, and all that Mr. Halford
                        suggests. I dragged at him hard. I gave him line. I sat down and endeavoured
                        to disengage my thoughts, but I never got a glimpse of him, and finally had
                        to wade as far in as I dared, and save as much of the casting line as I
                        could; it was very little.</p>

                    <p>There was one thing to be said for the trout on this side: they meant
                        business. They did not <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0113" n="76"/> rise shyly,
                        like the others, but went for the fly if it came at all near them, and then,
                        down they rushed, and bolted into the lily-roots.</p>

                    <p>A new plan occurred to me. I put on about eighteen inches of the stoutest gut
                        I had, to the end I knotted the biggest sea-trout fly I possessed, and,
                        hooking the next fish that rose, I turned my back on the loch and ran uphill
                        with the rod. Looking back I saw a trout well over a pound flying across the
                        lilies; but alas! the hold was not strong enough, and he fell back. Again
                        and again I tried this method, invariably hooking the trout, though the
                        heavy short casting-line and the big fly fell very awkwardly in the dead
                        stillness of the water. I had some exciting runs with them, for they came
                        eagerly to the big fly, and did not miss it, as they had missed the Red
                        Quill, or Whitchurch Dun, with which at first I tried to beguile them. One,
                        of only the average weight, I did drag out over the lilies; the others fell
                        off in mid-journey, but they never broke the uncompromising stout tackle.</p>

                    <p>With the first chill of evening they ceased <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0114"
                            n="77"/> rising, and I left them, not ungrateful for their very peculiar
                        manners and customs. The chances are that the trout beyond the band of weeds
                        never see an artificial fly, and they are, therefore, the more guileless--at
                        least, late in the season. In spring, I believe, the lilies are less in the
                        way, and I fear some one has put a Berthon boat on the loch in April. But it
                        is not so much what one catches in Loch Beg, as the monsters which one might
                        catch that make the tarn so desirable.</p>

                    <p>The loch seems to prove that any hill-tarn might be made a good place for
                        sport, if trout were introduced where they do not exist already. But the
                        size of these in Loch Beg puzzles me, nor can one see how they breed, as
                        breed they do: for twice or thrice I caught a fingerling, and threw him in
                        again. No burn runs out of the loch, and, even in a flood, the feeder is so
                        small, and its course so extremely steep, that one cannot imagine where the
                        fish manage to spawn. The only loch known to me where the common trout are
                        of equal size, is on the Border. It is extremely deep, with very clear
                        water, and with scarce any spawning <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0115" n="78"
                        /> ground. On a summer evening the trout are occasionally caught; three
                        weighing seven pounds were taken one night, a year or two ago. I have not
                        tried the evening fishing, but at all other times of day have found them the
                        "dourest" of trout, and they grow dourer. But one is always lured on by the
                        spectacle of the monsters which throw themselves out of water, with a splash
                        that echoes through all the circuit of the low green hills. They probably
                        reach at least four or five pounds, but it is unlikely that the biggest take
                        the fly, and one may doubt whether they propagate their species, as small
                        trout are never seen there.</p>

                    <p>There are two ways of enlarging the size of trout which should be carefully
                        avoided. Pike are supposed to keep down the population and leave more food
                        for the survivors, minnows are supposed to be nourishing food. Both of these
                        novelties are dangerous. Pike have been introduced in that long lovely sheet
                        of water, Loch Ken, and I have never once seen the rise of a trout break
                        that surface, so "hideously serene." <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0116" n="79"
                        /> Trout, in lochs which have become accustomed to feeding on minnows, are
                        apt to disdain fly altogether. Of course there are lochs in which good trout
                        coexist with minnows and with pike, but these inmates are too dangerous to
                        be introduced. The introduction, too, of Loch Leven trout is often
                        disappointing. Sometimes they escape down the burn into the river in floods;
                        sometimes, perhaps for lack of proper food and sufficient, they dwindle
                        terribly in size, and become no better than "brownies." In St. Mary's Loch,
                        in Selkirkshire, some Canadian trout were 
                        
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0117"
                            n="80"/> introduced. Little or nothing has been seen of them, unless
                        some small creatures of a quarter of a pound, extraordinarily silvery, and
                        more often in the air than in the water when hooked, are these children of
                        the remote West. If they grew up, and retained their beauty and
                        sprightliness, they would be excellent substitutes for sea-trout. Almost all
                        experiments in stocking lochs have their perils, except the simple
                        experiment of putting trout where there were no trout before. This can do no
                        harm, and they may increase in weight, let us hope not in wisdom, like the
                        curiously heavy and shy fish mentioned in the beginning of this paper.</p>

                <head>LOCH LEVEN</head>

                <p>I had a friend once, an angler, who in winter was fond of another sport. He liked
                    to cast his <hi rend="italic">louis</hi> into the green baize pond at Monte
                    Carlo, and, on the whole, he was generally "broken." He seldom landed the golden
                    fish of the old man's dream in Theocritus. When the croupier had gaffed all his
                    money he would repent and say, "Now, that would have kept me at Loch Leven for a
                    fortnight." One used to wonder whether a fortnight of Loch Leven was worth an
                    afternoon of the pleasure of losing at Monte Carlo. The loch has a name for
                    being cockneyfied, beset by whole fleets of competitive anglers from various
                    angling clubs in Scotland. That men should competitively angle shows, indeed, a
                    great want of true angling sentiment. To fish in a crowd is odious, to work hard
                    for prizes of flasks and <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0119" n="82"/> creels and
                    fly-books is to mistake the true meaning of the pastime. However, in this
                    crowded age men are so constituted that they like to turn a contemplative
                    exercise into a kind of Bank Holiday. There is no use in arguing with such
                    persons; the worst of their pleasure is that it tends to change a Scotch loch
                    into something like the pond of the Welsh Harp, at Hendon. It is always good
                    news to read in the papers how the Dundee Walton Society had a bad day, and how
                    the first prize was won by Mr. Macneesh, with five trout weighing three pounds
                    and three quarters. Loch Leven, then, is crowded and cockneyfied by
                    competitions; it has also no great name for beauty of landscape. Every one to
                    his own taste in natural beauty, but in this respect I think Loch Leven is
                    better than its reputation. It is certainly more pictorial, so to speak, than
                    some remote moor lochs up near Cape Wrath; Forsinard in particular, where the
                    scenery looks like one gigantic series of brown "baps," flat Scotch scones, all
                    of low elevation, all precisely similar to each other.</p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0120" n="83"/>

                <p>Loch Leven is not such a cockney place as the majority of men who have not
                    visited it imagine. It really is larger than the Welsh Harp at Hendon, and the
                    scenery, though not like that of Ben Cruachan or Ben Mohr, excels the landscape
                    of Middlesex. At the northern end is a small town, grey, with some red roofs and
                    one or two characteristic Fifeshire church-towers, squat and strong. There are
                    also a few factory chimneys, which are not fair to outward view, nor appropriate
                    by a loch-side. On the west are ranges of distant hills, low but not uncomely.
                    On the east rises a beautiful moorland steep with broken and graceful outlines.
                    When the sun shines on the red tilled land, in spring; when the smoke of burning
                    gorse coils up all day long into the sky, as if the Great Spirit were taking his
                    pipe of peace on the mountains; when the islands are mirrored on the glassy
                    water, then the artist rejoices, though the angler knows that he will waste his
                    day. As far as fishing goes, he is bound to be "clean," as the boatmen say--to
                    catch nothing; but the solemn peace, and the walls and <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0121" n="84"/> ruined towers of Queen Mary's prison,
                    may partially console the fisher. The accommodation is agreeable, there is a
                    pleasant inn--an old town-house, perhaps, of some great family, when the great
                    families did not rush up to London, but spent their winters in such country
                    towns as Dumfries and St. Andrews. The inn has a great green garden at its
                    doors, and if the talk is mainly of fishing, and if every one tells of his
                    monster trout that escaped the net, there is much worse conversation than that.</p>

                <p>When you reach Kinross, and, after excellent ham and eggs, begin to make a start,
                    the cockney element is most visible at the first. Everybody's name is registered
                    in a book; each pays a considerable, but not exorbitant, fee for the
                    society--often well worth the money--and the assistance of boatmen. These
                    gentlemen are also well provided with luncheon and beer, and, on the whole,
                    there is more pleasure in the life of a Loch Leven boatman than in most arts,
                    crafts, or professions. He takes the rod when his patron is lazy; it is said
                    that he often catches the

                        n="1" target="n1">{1}</ref> he sees a good deal of good company, and, if his
                    basket be heavy, who so content as he? The first thing is to row out to a good
                    bay, and which will prove a good bay depends on the strength and direction of
                    the wind. Perhaps the best fishing is farthest off, at the end of a long row,
                    but the best scenery is not so distant. A good deal hangs on an early start when
                    there are many boats out.</p>

                <p>Loch Leven is a rather shallow loch, seldom much over fifteen feet deep, save
                    where a long narrow rent or geological flaw runs through the bottom. The water
                    is of a queer glaucous green, olive-coloured, or rather like the tint made when
                    you wash out a box of water-colour paints. This is not so pretty as the black
                    wave of Loch Awe or Loch Shin, but has a redeeming quality in the richness of
                    the feeding for trout. These are fabled to average about a pound, but are
                    probably a trifle under that weight, on the whole. They are famous, and,
                    according to Sir Walter Scott, were famous as long ago as in Queen Mary's time,
                    for <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0125" n="86"/> the bright silver of their sides,
                    for their pink flesh, and gameness when hooked. Theorists have explained all
                    this by saying that they are the descendants of land-locked salmon. The flies
                    used on the loch are smaller than those favoured in the Highlands; they are sold
                    attached to casts, and four flies are actually employed at once. Probably two
                    are quite enough at a time. If a veteran trout is attracted by seeing four
                    flies, all of different species, and these like nothing in nature, all
                    conspiring to descend on him at once, he must be less cautious than we generally
                    find him. The Hampshire angler, of course, will sneer at the whole proceeding,
                    the "chucking and chancing it," in the queer-coloured wave, and the use of so
                    many fanciful entomological specimens. But the Hampshire angler is very welcome
                    to try his arts, in a calm, and his natural-looking cocked-up flies. He will
                    probably be defeated by a grocer from Greenock, sinking his four flies very
                    deep, as is, by some experts, recommended. The trout are capricious, perhaps as
                    capricious as any known to the angler, but they are believed to prefer a strong
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0126" n="87"/> east wind and a dark day. The east
                    wind is nowhere, perhaps, so bad as people fancy; it is certainly not so bad as
                    the north wind, and on Loch Leven it is the favourite. The man who is lucky
                    enough to hit on the right day, and to land a couple of dozen Loch Leven trout,
                    has very good reason to congratulate himself, and need envy nobody. But such
                    days and such takes are rare, and the summer of 1890 was much more unfortunate
                    than that of 1889.</p>

                <p>One great mistake is made by the company which farms the Loch, stocks it,
                    supplies the boats, and regulates the fishing. They permit trolling with angels,
                    or phantoms, or the natural minnow. Now, trolling may be comparatively
                    legitimate, when the boat is being pulled against the wind to its drift, but
                    there is no more skill in it than in sitting in an omnibus. But for trolling,
                    many a boat would come home "clean" in the evening, on days of calm, or when,
                    for other reasons of their own, the trout refuse to take the artificial fly. Yet
                    there are men at Loch Leven who troll all day, and poor sport it must be, as a
                    trout of a pound <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0127" n="88"/> or so has no chance
                    on a trolling-rod. This method is inimical to fly-fishing, but is such a
                    consolation to the inefficient angler that one can hardly expect to see it
                    abolished. The unsuccessful clamour for trolling, instead of consoling
                    themselves, as sportsmen should do, with the conversation of the gillies, their
                    anecdotes of great trout, and their reminiscences of great anglers, especially
                    of the late Mr. Russell, the famed editor of the "Scotsman." This humourist is
                    gradually "winning his way to the mythical." All fishing stories are attached to
                    him; his eloquence is said (in the language of the historian of the Buccaneers)
                    to have been "florid"; he is reported to have thrown his fly-book into Loch
                    Leven on an unlucky day, saying, "You brutes, take your choice," and a rock,
                    which he once hooked and held on to, is named after him, on the Tweed. In
                    addition to the humane and varied conversation of the boatmen, there is always
                    the pure pleasure of simply gazing at the hillsides and at the islands. They are
                    as much associated with the memory of Mary Stuart as Hermitage or even Holyrood.
                    On <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0128" n="89"/> that island was her prison; here
                    the rude Morton tried to bully her into signing away her rights; hence she may
                    often have watched the shore at night for the lighting of a beacon, a sign that
                    a rescue was at hand.</p>

                <p>The hills, at least, are much as she may have seen them, and the square towers
                    and crumbling walls on the island met her eyes when they were all too strong.
                    The "quay" is no longer "rude," as when "The Abbot" was written, and is crowded
                    with the green boats of the Loch Leven Company. But you still land on her island
                    under "the huge old tree" which Scott saw, which the unhappy Mary may herself
                    have seen. The small garden and the statues are gone, the garden whence Roland
                    Graeme led Mary to the boat and to brief liberty and hope unfulfilled. Only a
                    kind of ground- plan remains of the halls where Lindesay and Ruthven browbeat
                    her forlorn Majesty. But you may climb the staircase where Roland Graeme stood
                    sentinel, and feel a touch, of what Pepys felt when he kissed a dead
                    Queen--Katherine of Valois. Like Roland Graeme, the Queen may have been <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0129" n="90"/> "wearied to death of this Castle of
                    Loch Leven," where, in spring, all seems so beautiful, the trees budding freshly
                    above the yellow celandine and among the grey prison walls. It was a kindlier
                    prison house than Fotheringay, and minds peaceful and contented would gladly
                    have taken "this for a hermitage."</p>

                <p>The Roman Emperors used to banish too powerful subjects to the lovely isles that
                    lie like lilies on the AEgean. Plutarch tried to console these exiles, by
                    showing them how fortunate they were, far from the bustle of the Forum, the
                    vices, the tortures, the noise and smoke of Rome, happy, if they chose, in their
                    gardens, with the blue waters breaking on the rocks, and, as he is careful to
                    add, <hi rend="italic">with plenty of fishing</hi>. Mr. Mahaffy calls this
                    "rhetorical consolation," and the exiles may have been of his mind. But the
                    exiles would have been wise to listen to Plutarch, and, had I enjoyed the luck
                    of Mary Stuart, when Loch Leven was not overfished, when the trout were
                    uneducated, never would I have plunged into politics again. She might have been
                    very happy, with <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0130" n="91"/> Ronsard's latest
                    poems, with Italian romances, with a boat on the loch, and some Rizzio to sing
                    to her on the still summer days. From her Castle she would hear how the
                    politicians were squabbling, lying, raising a man to divinity and stoning him
                    next day, cutting each other's heads off, swearing and forswearing themselves,
                    conspiring and caballing. <hi rend="italic">Suave mari</hi>, and the peace of
                    Loch Leven and the island hermitage would have been the sweeter for the din
                    outside. A woman, a Queen, a Stuart, could not attain, and perhaps ought not to
                    have attained, this epicureanism. Mary Stuart had her chance, and <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0131" n="92"/> missed it; perhaps, after all, her
                    shrewish female gaoler made the passionless life impossible.</p>

                <p>These, at Loch Leven, are natural reflections. The place has a charm of its own,
                    especially if you make up your mind not to be disappointed, not to troll, and
                    not to envy the more fortunate anglers who shout to you the number of their
                    victories across the wave. Even at Loch Leven we may be contemplative, may be
                    quiet, and go a-fishing. <ref n="2" target="n2">{2}</ref></p>

                <head>THE BLOODY DOCTOR. (A BAD DAY ON CLEARBURN)</head>
                <p>Thou askest me, my brother, how first and where I met the Bloody Doctor? The tale
                    is weird, so weird that to a soul less proved than thine I scarce dare speak of
                    the adventure.</p>

                <p rend="center">* * * * *</p>

                <p>This, perhaps, would be the right way of beginning a story (not that it is a
                    story exactly), with the title forced on me by the name and nature of the hero.
                    But I do not think I could keep up the style without a lady- collaborator;
                    besides, I have used the term "weird" twice already, and thus played away the
                    trumps of modern picturesque diction. To return <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0133"
                        n="94"/> to our Doctor: many a bad day have I had on Clearburn Loch, and
                    never a good one. But one thing draws me always to the loch when I have the luck
                    to be within twenty miles of it. There are trout in Clearburn! The Border angler
                    knows that the trout in his native waters is nearly as extinct as the dodo. Many
                    causes have combined to extirpate the shy and spirited fish. First, there are
                    too many anglers:</p>

                <lg>
                    <l>Twixt Holy Lee and Clovenfords,</l>
                    <l>A tentier bit ye canna hae,</l>
                </lg>

                <p>sang that good old angler, now with God, Mr. Thomas Tod Stoddart. But between
                    Holy Lee and Clovenfords you may see half a dozen rods on every pool and stream.
                    There goes that leviathan, the angler from London, who has been beguiled hither
                    by the artless "Guide" of Mr. Watson Lyall. There fishes the farmer's lad, and
                    the schoolmaster, and the wandering weaver out of work or disinclined to work.
                    In his rags, with his thin face and red "goatee" beard, with his hazel wand and
                    his home-made reel, there is withal something kindly about this poor fellow, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0134" n="95"/> this true sportsman. He loves better
                    to hear the lark sing than the mouse cheep; he wanders from depopulated stream
                    to depopulated burn, and all is fish that comes to his fly. Fingerlings he
                    keeps, and does not return to the water "as pitying their youth." Let us not
                    grudge him his sport as long as he fishes fair, and he is always good company.
                    But he, with all the other countless fishermen, make fish so rare and so wary
                    that, except after a flood in Meggat or the Douglas burn, trout are scarce to be
                    taken by ordinary skill. As for</p>

                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>Thae reiving cheils</l>
                    <l>rae Galashiels,</l>
                </lg>

                <p>who use nets, and salmon roe, and poisons, and dynamite, they are miscreants
                    indeed; they spoil the sport, not of the rich, but of their own class, and of
                    every man who would be quiet, and go angling in the sacred streams of
                    Christopher North and the Shepherd. The mills, with their dyes and dirt, are
                    also responsible for the dearth of trout.</p>

                <lg type="line">
                    <l>Untainted yet thy stream, fair Teviot, runs,</l>
                </lg>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0135" n="96"/>

                <p>Leyden sang; but now the stream is very much tainted indeed below Hawick, like
                    Tweed in too many places. Thus, for a dozen reasons, trout are nigh as rare as
                    red deer. Clearburn alone remains full of unsophisticated fishes, and I have the
                    less hesitation in revealing this, because I do not expect the wanderer who may
                    read this page to be at all more successful than myself. No doubt they are
                    sometimes to be had, by the basketful, but not often, nor by him who thinks
                    twice before risking his life by smothering in a peaty bottom.</p>

                <p>To reach Clearburn Loch, if you start from the Teviot, you must pass through much
                    of Scott's country and most of Leyden's. I am credibly informed that persons of
                    culture have forgotten John Leyden. He was a linguist and a poet, and the friend
                    of Walter Scott, and knew</p>

                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>The mind whose fearless frankness naught could move,</l>
                    <l>The friendship, like an elder brother's love.</l>
                </lg>

                <p>We remember what distant and what deadly shore has Leyden's cold remains, and
                    people who do not know may not care to be reminded.</p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0136" n="97"/>

                <p>Leaving Teviot, with Leyden for a guide, you walk, or drive,</p>

                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>Where Bortha hoarse, that loads the meads with sand,</l>
                    <l>Rolls her red tide.</l>
                </lg>

                <p>Not that it was red when we passed, but <hi rend="italic">electro purior</hi>.</p>

                    <l>Through slaty hills whose sides are shagged with thorn,</l>
                    <l>Where springs, in scattered tufts, the dark green corn,</l>
                    <l>Towers wood-girt Harden far above the vale.</l>
                </lg>

                <p>And very dark green, almost blue, was the corn in September, 1888. Upwards,
                    always upwards, goes the road till you reach the crest, and watch far below the
                    wide champaign, like a sea, broken by the shapes of hills, Windburg and Eildon,
                    and Priesthaughswire, and "the rough skirts of stormy Ruberslaw," and Penchrise,
                    and the twin Maidens, shaped like the breasts of Helen. It is an old land, of
                    war, of Otterburn, and Ancrum, and the Raid of the Fair Dodhead; but the plough
                    has passed over all but the upper pastoral solitudes. Turning again to the
                    downward slope you see the loch of Alemoor, small and sullen, with Alewater
                    feeding it. Nobody knows much about the trout <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0137"
                        n="98"/> in it. "It is reckoned the residence of the water-cow," a monster
                    like the Australian bunyip. There was a water-cow in Scott's loch of
                    Cauldshiels, above Abbotsford. The water-cow has not lately emerged from Alemoor
                    to attack the casual angler. You climb again by gentle slopes till you reach a
                    most desolate tableland. Far beyond it is the round top of Whitecombe, which
                    again looks down on St. Mary's Loch, and up the Moffat, and across the Meggat
                    Water; but none of these are within the view. Round are <hi rend="italic"
                        >pastorum loca vasta</hi>, lands of Buccleugh and Bellenden, Deloraine,
                    Sinton, Headshaw, and Glack. Deloraine, by the way, is pronounced "Delorran,"
                    and perhaps is named from Orran, the Celtic saint. On the right lies, not far
                    from the road, a grey sheet of water, and this is Clearburn, where first I met
                    the Doctor.</p>

                <p>The loch, to be plain, is almost unfishable. It is nearly round, and everywhere,
                    except in a small segment on the eastern side, is begirt with reeds of great
                    height. These reeds, again, grow in a peculiarly uncomfortable, quaggy bottom,
                    which rises and falls, or rather which jumps and sinks 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0138" n="Illustration" />
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0139" />
                    
                    
                    <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0140" n="99"/> when you step on it, like the seat of
                    a very luxurious arm-chair. Moreover, the bottom is pierced with many springs,
                    wherein if you set foot you shall have thrown your last cast.</p>

                <p>By watching the loch when it is frozen, a man might come to learn something of
                    the springs; but, even so, it is hard to keep clear of them in summer. Now the
                    wind almost always blows from the west, dead against the little piece of
                    gravelly shore at the eastern side, so that casting against it is hard work and
                    unprofitable. On this day, by a rare chance, the wind blew from the east, though
                    the sky at first was a brilliant blue, and the sun hot and fierce. I walked
                    round to the east side, waded in, and caught two or three small fellows. It was
                    slow work, when suddenly there began the greatest rise of trout I ever saw in my
                    life. From the edge of the loch as far as one could clearly see across it there
                    was that endless plashing murmur, of all sounds in this world the sweetest to
                    the ear. Within the view of the eye, on each cast, there were a dozen trout
                    rising all about, never leaping, but seriously and solemnly feeding. Now is my
                    chance <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0141" n="100"/> at last, I fancied; but it was
                    not so--far from it. I might throw over the very noses of the beasts, but they
                    seldom even glanced at the (artificial) fly. I tried them with Greenwell's
                    Glory, with a March brown, with "the woodcock wing and hare- lug," but it was
                    almost to no purpose. If one did raise a fish, he meant not business--all but "a
                    casual brute," which broke the already weakened part of a small "glued-up" cane
                    rod. I had to twist a piece of paper round the broken end, wet it, and push it
                    into the joint, where it hung on somehow, but was not pleasant to cast with.
                    From twelve to half-past one the gorging went merrily forward, and I saw what
                    the fish were rising at. The whole surface of the loch, at least on the east
                    side, was absolutely peppered with large, hideous insects. They had big
                    grey-white wings, bodies black as night, and brilliant crimson legs, or feelers,
                    or whatever naturalists call them. The trout seemed as if they could not have
                    too much of these abominable wretches, and the flies were blown across the loch,
                    not singly, but in populous groups. I had never seen anything like them in any
                    hook-book, nor could I <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0142" n="101"/> deceive the
                    trout by the primitive dodge of tying a red thread round the shank of a dark
                    fly. So I waded out, and fell to munching a frugal sandwich and watching Nature,
                    not without a cigarette.</p>

                <p>Now Nature is all very well. I have nothing to say against her of a Sunday, or
                    when trout are not rising. But she was no comfort to me now. Smiling she gazed
                    on my discomfiture. The lovely lines of the hills, curving about the loch, and
                    with their deepest dip just opposite where I sat, were all of a golden autumn
                    brown, except in the violet distance. The grass of Parnassus grew thick and
                    white around me, with its moonlight tint of green in the veins. On a hillside by
                    a brook the countryfolk were winning their hay, and their voices reached me
                    softly from far off. On the loch the marsh-fowl flashed and dipped, the wild
                    ducks played and dived and rose; first circling high and higher, then,
                    marshalled in the shape of a V, they made for Alemoor. A solitary heron came
                    quite near me, and tried his chance with the fish, but I think he had no luck.
                    All this is pleasant to remember, and I made rude sketches <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0143" n="102"/> in the fly-leaves of a copy of Hogg's
                    poems, where I kept my flies. But what joy was there in this while the "take"
                    grew fainter and ceased at least near the shore? Out in the middle, where few
                    flies managed to float, the trout were at it till dark. But near shore there was
                    just one trout who never stopped gorging all day. He lived exactly opposite the
                    nick in the distant hills, and exactly a yard farther out than I could throw a
                    fly. He was a big one, and I am inclined to think that he was the Devil. For, if
                    I had stepped in deeper, and the water had come over my wading boots, the odds
                    are that my frail days on earth would have been ended by a chill, and I knew
                    this, and yet that fish went on tempting me to my ruin. I suppose I tried to
                    reach him a dozen times, and cast a hundred, but it was to no avail. At length,
                    as the afternoon grew grey and chill, I pitched a rock at him, by way of showing
                    that I saw through his fiendish guile, and I walked away.</p>

                <p>There was no rise now, and the lake was leaden and gloomy. When I reached the
                    edge of <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0144" n="103"/> the deep reeds I tried, once
                    or twice, to wade through them within casting distance of the water, but was
                    always driven off by the traitorous quagginess of the soil. At last, taking my
                    courage in both hands, I actually got so near that I could throw a fly over the
                    top of the tall reeds, and then came a heavy splash, and the wretched little
                    broken rod nearly doubled up. "Hooray, here I am among the big ones!" I said,
                    and held on. It was now that I learned the nature of Nero's diversion when he
                    was an angler in the Lake of Darkness. The loch really did deserve the term
                    "grim"; the water here was black, the sky was ashen, the long green reeds closed
                    cold about me, and beyond them there was trout that I could not deal with. For
                    when he tired of running, which was soon, he was as far away as ever. Draw him
                    through the forest of reeds I could not. At last I did the fatal thing. I took
                    hold of the line, and then, "plop," as the poet said. He was off. A young
                    sportsman on the bank who had joined me expressed his artless disappointment. I
                    cast over the confounded reeds once more. "Splash!"--the old story! I <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0145" n="104"/> stuck to the fish, and got him into
                    the watery wood, and then he went where the lost trout go. No more came on, so I
                    floundered a yard or two farther, and climbed into a wild-fowl's nest, a kind of
                    platform of matted reeds, all yellow and faded. The nest immediately sank down
                    deep into the water, but it stopped somewhere, and I made a cast. The black
                    water boiled, and the trout went straight down and sulked. I merely held on,
                    till at last it seemed "time for us to go," and by cautious tugging I got him
                    through the reedy jungle, and "gruppit him," as the Shepherd would have said. He
                    was simply but decently wrapped round, from snout to tail, in very fine
                    water-weeds, as in a garment. Moreover, he was as black as your hat, quite
                    unlike the comely yellow trout who live on the gravel in Clearburn. It hardly
                    seemed sensible to get drowned in this gruesome kind of angling, so, leaving the
                    Lake of Darkness, we made for Buccleugh, passing the cleugh where the buck was
                    ta'en. Surely it is the deepest, the steepest, and the greenest cleugh that is
                    shone on by the sun! Thereby we met an angler, an ancient man <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0146" n="105"/> in hodden grey, strolling home from
                    the Rankle burn. And we told him of our bad day, and asked him concerning that
                    hideous fly, which had covered the loch and lured the trout from our decent
                    Greenwells and March browns. And the ancient man listened to our description of
                    the monster, and He said: "Hoot, ay; ye've jest forgathered wi' the Bloody
                    Doctor."</p>

                <p>This, it appears, is the Border angler's name for the horrible insect, so much
                    appreciated by trout. So we drove home, when all the great tableland was touched
                    with yellow light from a rift in the west, and all the broken hills looked blue
                    against the silvery grey. God bless them! for man cannot spoil them, nor any
                    revolution shape them other than they are. We see them as the folk from Flodden
                    saw them, as Leyden knew them, as they looked to William of Deloraine, as they
                    showed in the eyes of Wat of Harden and of Jamie Telfer of the Fair Dodhead.
                    They have always girdled a land of warriors and of people fond of song, from the

                <head>THE LADY OR THE SALMON?</head>

                <p>The circumstances which attended and caused the death of the Hon. Houghton
                    Grannom have not long been known to me, and it is only now that, by the decease
                    of his father, Lord Whitchurch, and the extinction of his noble family, I am
                    permitted to divulge the facts. That the true tale of my unhappy friend will
                    touch different chords in different breasts, I am well aware. The sportsman, I
                    think, will hesitate to approve him; the <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0149"
                        n="108"/> fair, I hope, will absolve. Who are we, to scrutinise human
                    motives, and to award our blame to actions which, perhaps, might have been our
                    own, had opportunity beset and temptation beguiled us? There is a certain point
                    at which the keenest sense of honour, the most chivalrous affection and
                    devotion, cannot bear the strain, but break like a salmon line under a masterful
                    stress. That my friend succumbed, I admit; that he was his own judge, the
                    severest, and passed and executed sentence on himself, I have now to show.</p>

                <p>I shall never forget the shock with which I read in the "Scotsman," under
                    "Angling," the following paragraph:</p>

                <p>"Tweed.--Strange Death of an Angler.--An unfortunate event has cast a gloom over
                    fishers in this district. As Mr. K---, the keeper on the B--- water, was busy
                    angling yesterday, his attention was caught by some object floating on the
                    stream. He cast his flies over it, and landed a soft felt hat, the ribbon stuck
                    full of salmon-flies. Mr. K--- at once hurried up-stream, filled with the most
                    lively apprehensions. These were <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0150" n="109"/> soon
                    justified. In a shallow, below the narrow, deep and dangerous rapids called 'The
                    Trows,' Mr. K--- saw a salmon leaping in a very curious manner. On a closer
                    examination, he found that the fish was attached to a line. About seventy yards
                    higher he found, in shallow water, the body of a man, the hand still grasping in
                    death the butt of the rod, to which the salmon was fast, all the line being run
                    out. Mr. K--- at once rushed into the stream, and dragged out the body, in which
                    he recognised with horror the Hon. Houghton Grannom, to whom the water was
                    lately let. Life had been for some minutes extinct, and though Mr. K---
                    instantly hurried for Dr. ---, that gentleman could only attest the melancholy
                    fact. The wading in 'The Trows' is extremely dangerous and difficult, and Mr.
                    Grannom, who was fond of fishing without an attendant, must have lost his
                    balance, slipped, and been dragged down by the weight of his waders. The recent
                    breaking off of the hon. gentleman's contemplated marriage on the very
                    wedding-day will be fresh in the memory of our readers."</p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0151" n="110"/>

                <p>This was the story which I read in the newspaper during breakfast one morning in
                    November. I was deeply grieved, rather than astonished, for I have often
                    remonstrated with poor Grannom on the recklessness of his wading. It was with
                    some surprise that I received, in the course of the day, a letter from him, in
                    which he spoke only of indifferent matters, of the fishing which he had taken,
                    and so forth. The letter was accompanied, however, by a parcel. Tearing off the
                    outer cover, I found a sealed document addressed to me, with the superscription,
                    "Not to be opened until after my father's decease." This injunction, of course,
                    I have scrupulously obeyed. The death of Lord Whitchurch, the last of the
                    Grannoms, now gives me liberty to publish my friend's <hi rend="italic">Apologia
                        pro morte et vita sua</hi>.</p>

                <p>"Dear Smith" (the document begins), "Before you read this--long before, I hope--I
                    shall have solved the great mystery--if, indeed, we solve it. If the water runs
                    down to-morrow, and there is every prospect that it will do so, I must have the
                    opportunity of making such an end as even <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0152"
                        n="111"/> malignity cannot suspect of being voluntary. There are plenty of
                    fish in the water; if I hook one in 'The Trows,' I shall let myself go whither
                    the current takes me. Life has for weeks been odious to me; for what is life
                    without honour, without love, and coupled with shame and remorse? Repentance I
                    cannot call the emotion which gnaws me at the heart, for in similar
                    circumstances (unlikely as these are to occur) I feel that I would do the same
                    thing again.</p>

                <p>"Are we but automata, worked by springs, moved by the stronger impulse, and
                    unable to choose for ourselves which impulse that shall be? Even now, in
                    decreeing my own destruction, do I exercise free-will, or am I the sport of
                    hereditary tendencies, of mistaken views of honour, of a seeming self-sacrifice,
                    which, perhaps, is but selfishness in disguise? I blight my unfortunate father's
                    old age; I destroy the last of an ancient house; but I remove from the path of
                    Olive Dunne the shadow that must rest upon the sunshine of what will eventually,
                    I trust, be a happy life, unvexed by memories of one who loved her passionately.
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0153" n="112"/> Dear Olive! how pure, how ardent
                    was my devotion to her none knows better than you. But Olive had, I will not say
                    a fault, though I suffer from it, but a quality, or rather two qualities, which
                    have completed my misery. Lightly as she floats on the stream of society, the
                    most casual observer, and even the enamoured beholder, can see that Olive Dunne
                    has great pride, and no sense of humour. Her dignity is her idol. What makes
                    her, even for a moment, the possible theme of ridicule is in her eyes an
                    unpardonable sin. This sin, I must with penitence confess, I did indeed commit.
                    Another woman might have forgiven me. I know not how that may be; I throw myself
                    on the mercy of the court. But, if another could pity and pardon, to Olive this
                    was impossible. I have never seen her since that fatal moment when, paler than
                    her orange blossoms, she swept through the porch of the church, while I,
                    dishevelled, mud-stained, half-drowned--ah! that memory will torture me if
                    memory at all remains. And yet, fool, maniac, that I was, I could not resist the
                    wild, mad impulse to laugh which shook the rustic spectators, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0154" n="113"/> and which in my case was due, I
                    trust, to hysterical but <hi rend="italic">not</hi> unmanly emotion. If any
                    woman, any bride, could forgive such an apparent but most unintentional insult,
                    Olive Dunne, I knew, was not that woman. My abject letters of explanation, my
                    appeals for mercy, were returned unopened. Her parents pitied me, perhaps had
                    reasons for being on my side, but Olive was of marble. It is not only myself
                    that she cannot pardon, she will never, I know, forgive herself while my
                    existence reminds her of what she had to endure. When she receives the
                    intelligence of my demise, no suspicion will occur to her; she will not say 'He
                    is fitly punished;' but her peace of mind will gradually return.</p>

                <p>"It is for this, mainly, that I sacrifice myself, but also because I cannot
                    endure the dishonour of a laggard in love and a recreant bridegroom.</p>

                <p>"So much for my motives: now to my tale.</p>

                <p>"The day before our wedding-day had been the happiest in my life. Never had I
                    felt so certain of Olive's affections, never so fortunate in my own. We parted
                    in the soft moonlight; she, no doubt, <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0155" n="114"/>
                    to finish her nuptial preparations; I, to seek my couch in the little rural inn
                    above the roaring waters of the Budon. <ref n="3" target="n3">{3}</ref></p>

                    <l>From fringes of the faded eve</l>

                <p>I murmured, though the atmospheric conditions were not really those described by
                    the poet.</p>

                <p>"'River in grand order, sir,' said the voice of Robins, the keeper, who
                    recognised me in the moonlight. 'There's a regular monster in the Ashweil,' he
                    added, naming a favourite cast; 'never saw nor heard of such a fish in the water
                    before.'</p>

                <p>"'Mr. Dick must catch him, Robins,' I answered; 'no fishing for me to- morrow.'</p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0156" n="115"/>

                <p>"'No, sir,' said Robins, affably. 'Wish you joy, sir, and Miss Olive, too. It's a
                    pity, though! Master Dick, he throws a fine fly, but he gets flurried with a big
                    fish, being young. And this one is a topper.'</p>

                <p>"With that he gave me good-night, and I went to bed, but not to sleep. I was
                    fevered with happiness; the past and future reeled before my wakeful vision. I
                    heard every clock strike; the sounds of morning were astir, and still I could
                    not sleep. The ceremony, for reasons connected with our long journey to my
                    father's place in Hampshire, was to be early--half- past ten was the hour. I
                    looked at my watch; it was seven of the clock, and then I looked out of the
                    window: it was a fine, soft grey morning, with a south wind tossing the
                    yellowing boughs. I got up, dressed in a hasty way, and thought I would just
                    take a look at the river. It was, indeed, in glorious order, lapping over the
                    top of the sharp stone which we regarded as a measure of the due size of water.</p>

                <p>"The morning was young, sleep was out of the question; I could not settle my mind
                    to read. <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0157" n="116"/> Why should I not take a
                    farewell cast, alone, of course? I always disliked the attendance of a gillie. I
                    took my salmon rod out of its case, rigged it up, and started for the stream,
                    which flowed within a couple of hundred yards of my quarters. There it raced
                    under the ash tree, a pale delicate brown, perhaps a little thing too coloured.
                    I therefore put on a large Silver Doctor, and began steadily fishing down the
                    ash-tree cast. What if I should wipe Dick's eye, I thought, when, just where the
                    rough and smooth water meet, there boiled up a head and shoulders such as I had
                    never seen on any fish. My heart leaped and stood still, but there came no
                    sensation from the rod, and I finished the cast, my knees actually trembling
                    beneath me. Then I gently lifted the line, and very elaborately tested every
                    link of the powerful casting-line. Then I gave him ten minutes by my watch;
                    next, with unspeakable emotion, I stepped into the stream and repeated the cast.
                    Just at the same spot he came up again; the huge rod bent like a switch, and the
                    salmon rushed straight down the pool, as if he meant to <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0158" n="117"/> make for the sea. I staggered on to
                    dry land to follow him the easier, and dragged at my watch to time the fish; a
                    quarter to eight. But the slim chain had broken, and the watch, as I hastily
                    thrust it back, missed my pocket and fell into the water. There was no time to
                    stoop for it; the fish started afresh, tore up the pool as fast as he had gone
                    down it, and, rushing behind the torrent, into the eddy at the top, leaped clean
                    out of the water. He was 70 lbs. if he was an ounce. Here he slackened a little,
                    dropping back, and I got in some line. Now he sulked so intensely that I thought
                    he had got the line round a rock. It might be broken, might be holding fast to a
                    sunken stone, for aught that I could tell; and the time was passing, I knew not
                    how rapidly. I tried all known methods, tugging at him, tapping the butt, and
                    slackening line on him. At last the top of the rod was slightly agitated, and
                    then, back flew the long line in my face. Gone! I reeled up with a sigh, but the
                    line tightened again. He had made a sudden rush under my bank, but there he lay
                    again like a stone. How long? Ah! I cannot <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0159"
                        n="118"/> tell how long! I heard the church clock strike, but missed the
                    number of the strokes. Soon he started again down-stream into the shallows,
                    leaping at the end of his rush--the monster. Then he came slowly up, and
                    'jiggered' savagely at the line. It seemed impossible that any tackle could
                    stand these short violent jerks. Soon he showed signs of weakening. Once his
                    huge silver side appeared for a moment near the surface, but he retreated to his
                    old fastness. I was in a tremor of delight and despair. I should have thrown
                    down my rod, and flown on the wings of love to Olive and the altar. But I hoped
                    that there was time still--that it was not so very late! At length he was
                    failing. I heard ten o'clock strike. He came up and lumbered on the surface of
                    the pool. Gradually I drew him, plunging ponderously, to the gravelled beach,
                    where I meant to 'tail' him. He yielded to the strain, he was in the shallows,
                    the line was shortened. I stooped to seize him. The frayed and overworn gut
                    broke at a knot, and with a loose roll he dropped back towards the deep. I
                    sprang at him, stumbled, fell on him, <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0160" n="119"/>
                    struggled with him, but he slipped from my arms. In that moment I knew more than
                    the anguish of Orpheus. Orpheus! Had I, too, lost my Eurydice? I rushed from the
                    stream, up the steep bank, along to my rooms. I passed the church door. Olive,
                    pale as her orange- blossoms, was issuing from the porch. The clock pointed to
                    10.45. I was ruined, I knew it, and I laughed. I laughed like a lost spirit. She
                    swept past me, and, amidst the amazement of the gentle and simple, I sped wildly
                    away. Ask me no more. The rest is silence."</p>

                <p>Thus ends my hapless friend's narrative. I leave it to the judgment of women and
                    of men. Ladies, would you have acted as Olive Dunne acted? Would pride, or
                    pardon, or mirth have ridden sparkling in your eyes? Men, my brethren, would ye
                    have deserted the salmon for the lady, or the lady for the salmon? I know what I
                    would have done had I been fair Olive Dunne. What I would have done had I been
                    Houghton Grannom I may not venture to divulge. For this narrative, <pb

                <head>A TWEEDSIDE SKETCH</head>

                <p>The story of the following adventure--this deplorable confession, one may
                    say--will not have been written in vain if it impresses on young minds the
                    supreme necessity of carefulness about details. Let the "casual" and regardless
                    who read it--the gatless, as they say in Suffolk--ponder the lesson which it
                    teaches: a lesson which no amount of bitter experience has ever impressed on the
                    unprincipled narrator. Never do anything carelessly whether in fishing or in
                    golf, and carry this important maxim even into the most serious affairs of life.
                    Many a battle has been lost, no doubt, by lack of ammunition, or by plenty of
                    ammunition which did not happen to suit the guns; and many a salmon has been
                    lost, ay, and many a trout, for want of carefulness, and through a culpable
                    inattention <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0163" n="122"/> to the soundness of your
                    gut, and tackle generally. What fiend is it that prompts a man just to try a
                    hopeless cast, in a low water, without testing his tackle? As sure as you do
                    that, up comes the fish, and with his first dash breaks your casting line, and
                    leaves you lamenting. This doctrine I preach, being my own "awful example." "Bad
                    and careless little boy," my worthy master used to say at school; and he would
                    have provoked a smile in other circumstances. But Mr. Trotter, of the Edinburgh
                    Academy, had something about him (he usually carried it in the tail-pocket of
                    his coat) which inspired respect and discouraged ribaldry. Would that I had
                    listened to Mr. Trotter; would that I had corrected, in early life, the
                    happy-go-lucky disposition to scatter my Greek accents, as it were, with a
                    pepper-caster, to fish with worn tackle, and, generally, to make free with the
                    responsibilities of life and literature. It is too late to amend, but others may
                    learn wisdom from this spectacle of deserved misfortune and absolute
                    discomfiture.</p>
                    <p>I am not myself a salmon-fisher, though willing

                        n="123"/> to try that art again, and though this is a tale of salmon. To
                    myself the difference between angling for trout and angling for salmon is like
                    the difference between a drawing of Lionardo's, in silver point, and a loaded
                    landscape by MacGilp, R.A. Trout-fishing is all an idyll, all delicacy--that is,
                    trout-fishing on the Test or on the Itchen. You wander by clear water, beneath
                    gracious poplar-trees, unencumbered with anything but a slim rod of Messrs.
                    Hardy's make, and a light toy-box of delicate flies. You need seldom wade, and
                    the water is shallow, the bottom is of silver gravel. You need not search all
                    day at random, but you select a rising trout, and endeavour to lay the floating
                    fly delicately over him. If you part with him, there is always another feeding
                    merrily:</p>

                <lg>
                    <l>Invenies alium si te hic fastidit.</l>
                </lg>

                <p>It is like an excursion into Corot's country, it is rich in memories of Walton
                    and Cotton: it is a dream of peace, and they bring you your tea by the
                    riverside. In salmon-fishing, on the Tweed at least, all is different. The rod,
                    at all events the <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0167" n="124"/> rod which some one
                    kindly lent me, is like a weaver's beam. The high heavy wading trousers and
                    boots are even as the armour of the giant of Gath. You have to plunge waist
                    deep, or deeper, into roaring torrents, and if the water be at all "drumly" you
                    have not an idea where your next step may fall. It may be on a hidden rock, or
                    on a round slippery boulder, or it may be into a deep "pot" or hole. The
                    inexperienced angler staggers like a drunken man, is occasionally drowned, and
                    more frequently is ducked. You have to cast painfully, with steep precipitous
                    banks behind you, <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0168" n="125"/> all overgrown with
                    trees, with bracken, with bramble. It is a boy's work to disentangle the fly
                    from the branches of ash and elm and pine. There is no delicacy, and there is a
                    great deal of exertion in all this. You do not cast subtilely over a fish which
                    you know is there, but you swish, swish, all across the current, with a strong
                    reluctance to lift the line after each venture and try another. The small of the
                    back aches, and it is literally in the sweat of your brow that you take your
                    diversion. After all, there are many blank days, when the salmon will look at no
                    fly, or when you encounter the Salmo irritans, who rises with every appearance
                    of earnest good-will, but never touches the hook, or, if he does touch it, runs
                    out a couple of yards of line, and vanishes for ever. What says the poet?</p>

                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>There's an accommodating fish,</l>
                    <l>In pool or stream, by rock or pot,</l>
                    <l>Who rises frequent as you wish,</l>
                    <l>At "Popham," "Parson," or "Jock Scott,"</l>
                    <l>Or almost any fly you've got</l>
                    <l>In all the furred and feathered clans.</l>
                    <l>You strike, but ah, you strike him not</l>
                    <l>He is the <hi rend="italic">Salmo irritans</hi>!</l>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0169" n="126"/>

                <p>It may be different in Norway or on the lower casts of the Tweed, as at Floors,
                    or Makerstoun; but higher up the country, in Scott's own country, at Yair or
                    Ashiesteil, there is often a terrible amount of fruitless work to be done. And I
                    doubt if, except in throwing a very long line, and knowing the waters by old
                    experience, there is very much skill in salmon- fishing. It is all an affair of
                    muscle and patience. The choice of flies is almost a pure accident. Every one
                    believes in the fly with which he has been successful. These strange
                    combinations of blues, reds, golds, of tinsel and worsted, of feathers and fur,
                    are purely fantastic articles. They are like nothing in nature, and are
                    multiplied for the fanciful amusement of anglers. Nobody knows why salmon rise
                    at them; nobody knows why they will bite on one day and not on another, or
                    rather, on many others. It is not even settled whether we should use a bright
                    fly on a bright day, and a dark fly on a dark day, as Dr. Hamilton advises, or
                    reverse the choice as others use. Muscles and patience, these, I repeat, are the
                    only ingredients of ultimate success.</p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0170" n="127"/>

                <p>However, one does do at Rome as the Romans do, and fishes for salmon in Tweed
                    when the nets are off in October, when the yellowing leaves begin to fall, and
                    when that beautiful reach of wooded valley from Elibank to the meeting of Tweed
                    and Ettrick is in the height of its autumnal charm. Why has Yarrow been so much
                    more besung than Tweed, in spite of the greater stream's far greater and more
                    varied loveliness? The fatal duel in the Dowie Dens of Yarrow and the lamented
                    drowning of Willie there have given the stream its 'pastoral melancholy,' and
                    engaged Wordsworth in the renown of the water. For the poetry of Tweed we have
                    chiefly, after Scott, to thank Mr. Stoddart, its loyal minstrel. "Dearer than
                    all these to me," he says about our other valleys, "is sylvan Tweed."</p>

                <lg type="stanza">

                    <l>Sae saftly meet and mingle there.</l>

                <p>He kept his promise, given in the following verse:</p>

                <lg>
                    <l>And I, when to breathe is a labour, and joy</l>
                    <l>Forgets me, and life is no longer the boy,</l>
                    <l>On the labouring staff, and the tremorous knee,</l>
                    <l>Will wander, bright river, to thee!</l>
                </lg>

                <p>Life is always "the boy" when one is beside the Tweed. Times change, and we
                    change, for the worse. But the river changes little. Still he courses through
                    the keen and narrow rocks beneath the bridge of Yair.</p>

                <p>From Yair, which hills so closely bind, Scarce can the Tweed his passage find,
                    Though much he fret, and chafe, and toil, Till all his eddying currents boil.</p>

                <p>Still the water loiters by the long boat-pool of Yair, as though loath to leave
                    the drooping boughs of the elms. Still it courses with a deep eddy through the
                    Elm Wheel, and ripples under Fernilea, where the author of the "Flowers of the
                    Forest" lived in that now mouldering and roofless hall, with the peaked turrets.
                    Still Neidpath is fair, Neidpath of the unhappy maid, and still we mark the tiny
                    burn at Ashiesteil, how in November,</p>

                    <l>Murmuring hoarse, and frequent seen,</l>
                    <l>Through bush and briar, no longer green,</l>
                    <l>An angry brook, it sweeps the glade,</l>
                    <l>Brawls over rock and wild cascade,</l>

                    <l>Hurries its waters to the Tweed.</l>
                </lg>

                <p>Still the old tower of Elibank is black and strong in ruin; Elibank, the home of
                    that Muckle Mou'd Meg, who made Harden after all a better bride than he would
                    have found in the hanging ash-tree of her father. These are unaltered, mainly,
                    since Scott saw them last, and little altered is the homely house of Ashiesteil,
                    where he had been so happy. And we, too, feel but little change among those
                    scenes of long ago, those best-beloved haunts of boyhood, where we have had so
                    many good days and bad, days of rising trout and success; days of failure, and
                    even of half-drowning.</p>

                <p>One cannot reproduce the charm of the strong river in pool and stream, of the
                    steep rich bank that it rushes or lingers by, of the green and heathery hills
                    beyond, or the bare slopes where the blue slate breaks through among the dark
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0175" n="130"/> old thorn-trees, remnants of the
                    forest. It is all homely and all haunted, and, if a Tweedside fisher might have
                    his desire, he would sleep the long sleep in the little churchyard that lies
                    lonely above the pool of Caddon-foot, and hard by Christopher North's favourite
                    quarters at Clovenfords.</p>

                <p>However, while we are still on earth, Caddon-foot is more attractive for her long
                    sweep of salmon-pool--the home of sea-trout too--than precisely for her
                    kirk-yard. There will be time enough for that, and time it is to recur to the
                    sad story of the big fish and the careless angler. It was about the first day of
                    October, and we had enjoyed a "spate." Salmon-fishing is a mere child of the
                    weather; with rain almost anybody may raise fish, without it all art is apt to
                    be vain. We had been blessed with a spate. On Wednesday the Tweed had been
                    roaring red from bank to bank. Salmon-fishing was wholly out of the question,
                    and it is to be feared that the innumerable trout-fishers, busy on every eddy,
                    were baiting with salmon roe, an illegal lure. On Thursday <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0176" n="131"/> the red tinge had died out of the
                    water, but only a very strong wader would have ventured in; others had a good
                    chance, if they tried it, of being picked up at Berwick. Friday was the luckless
                    day of my own failure and broken heart. The water was still very heavy and
                    turbid, a frantic wind was lashing the woods, heaps of dead leaves floated down,
                    and several sheaves of corn were drifted on the current. The long boat-pool at
                    Yair, however, is sheltered by wooded banks, and it was possible enough to cast,
                    in spite of the wind's fury. We had driven from a place about five miles
                    distant, and we had not driven three hundred yards before I remembered that we
                    had forgotten the landing-net. But, as I expected nothing, it did not seem worth
                    while to go back for this indispensable implement. We reached the waterside, and
                    found that the trout were feeding below the pendent branches of the trees and in
                    the quiet, deep eddies of the long boat-pool. One cannot see rising trout
                    without casting over them, in preference to labouring after salmon, so I put up
                    a small rod and diverted <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0177" n="132"/> myself from
                    the bank. It was to little purpose. Tweed trout are now grown very shy and
                    capricious; even a dry fly failed to do any execution worth mentioning.
                    Conscience compelled me, as I had been sent out by kind hosts to fish for
                    salmon, not to neglect my orders. The armour--the ponderous gear of the
                    fisher--was put on with the enormous boots, and the gigantic rod was equipped.
                    Then came the beginning of sorrows. We had left the books of salmon flies
                    comfortably reposing at home. We had also forgotten the whiskey flask.
                    Everything, in fact, except cigarettes, had been left behind. Unluckily, not
                    quite everything: I had a trout fly-book, and therein lay just one large salmon
                    fly, not a Tweed fly, but a lure that is used on the beautiful and hopeless
                    waters of the distant Ken, in Galloway. It had brown wings, a dark body, and a
                    piece of jungle-cock feather, and it was fastened to a sea-trout casting-line.
                    Now, if I had possessed no salmon flies at all, I must either have sent back for
                    some, or gone on innocently dallying with trout. But this one wretched fly <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0178" n="133"/> lured me to my ruin. I saw that the
                    casting-line had a link which seemed rather twisted. I tried it; but, in the
                    spirit of Don Quixote with his helmet, I did not try it hard. I waded into the
                    easiest-looking part of the pool, just above a huge tree that dropped its boughs
                    to the water, and began casting, merely from a sense of duty. I had not cast a
                    dozen times before there was a heavy, slow plunge in the stream, and a glimpse
                    of purple and azure.</p>

                <p>"That's him," cried a man who was trouting on the opposite bank. Doubtless it was
                    "him," but he had not touched the hook. I believe the correct thing would have
                    been to wait for half an hour, and then try the fish with a smaller fly. But I
                    had no smaller fly, no other fly at all. I stepped back a few paces, and fished
                    down again. In Major Traherne's work I have read that the heart leaps, or stands
                    still, or otherwise betrays an uncomfortable interest, when one casts for the
                    second time over a salmon which has risen. I cannot honestly say that I suffered
                    from this tumultuous emotion. "He will not come again," <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0179" n="134"/> I said, when there was a long heavy
                    drag at the line, followed by a shrieking of the reel, as in Mr. William Black's
                    novels. Let it be confessed that the first hooking of a salmon is an excitement
                    unparalleled in trout-fishing. There have been anglers who, when the salmon was
                    once on, handed him over to the gillie to play and land. One would like to act
                    as gillie to those lordly amateurs. My own fish rushed down stream, where the
                    big tree stands. I had no hope of landing him if he took that course, because
                    one could neither pass the rod under the boughs, nor wade out beyond them. But
                    he soon came back, while one took in line, and discussed his probable size with
                    the trout-fisher opposite. His size, indeed! Nobody knows what it was, for when
                    he had come up to the point whence he had started, he began a policy of violent
                    short tugs--not "jiggering," as it is called, but plunging with all his weight
                    on the line. I had clean forgotten the slimness of the tackle, and, as he was
                    clearly well hooked, held him perhaps too hard. Only a very raw beginner likes
                    to take hours over <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0180" n="135"/> landing a fish.
                    Perhaps I held him too tight: at all events, after a furious plunge, back came
                    the line; the casting line had snapped at the top link.</p>

                <p>There was no more to be said or done, except to hunt for another fly in the trout
                    fly-book. Here there was no such thing, but a local spectator offered me a huge
                    fly, more like a gaff, and equipped with a large iron eye for attaching the gut
                    to. Withal I suspect this weapon was meant, not for fair fishing, but for
                    "sniggling." Now "sniggling" is a form of cold-blooded poaching. In the open
                    water, on the Ettrick, you may see half a dozen snigglers busy. They all wear
                    high wading trousers; they are all armed with stiff salmon-rods and huge flies.
                    They push the line and the top joints of the rod deep into the water, drag it
                    along, and then bring the hook out with a jerk. Often it sticks in the side of a
                    salmon, and in this most unfair and unsportsmanlike way the free sport of honest
                    people is ruined, and fish are diminished in number. Now, the big fly <hi
                        rend="italic">may</hi> have been an honest character, but he was sadly <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0181" n="136"/> like a rake- hook in disguise. He did
                    not look as if an fish could fancy him. I, therefore, sent a messenger across
                    the river to beg, buy, or borrow a fly at "The Nest." But this pretty cottage is
                    no longer the home of the famous angling club, which has gone a mile or two up
                    the water and builded for itself a new dwelling. My messenger came back with one
                    small fatigued-looking fly, a Popham, I think, which had been lent by some one
                    at a farmhouse. The water was so heavy that the small fly seemed useless;
                    however, we fastened it on as a dropper, using the sniggler as the trail fly; so
                    exhausted were our resources, that I had to cut a piece of gut off a minnow
                    tackle and attach the small fly to that. The tiny gut loop of the fly was
                    dreadfully frayed, and with a heavy heart I began fishing again. My friend on
                    the opposite side called out that big fish were rising in the bend of the
                    stream, so thither I went, stumbling over rocks, and casting with much
                    difficulty, as the high overgrown banks permit no backward sweep of the line.
                    You are obliged to cast by a kind of forward thrust of the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0182" n="137"/> arms, a knack not to be acquired in a
                    moment. I splashed away awkwardly, but at last managed to make a straight, clean
                    cast. There was a slight pull, such as a trout gives in mid-stream under water.
                    I raised the point, and again the reel sang aloud and gleefully as the salmon
                    rushed down the stream farther and faster than the first. It is a very pleasant
                    thing to hook a salmon when you are all alone, as I was then--alone with
                    yourself and the Goddess of Fishing. This salmon, just like the other, now came
                    back, and instantly began the old tactics of heavy plunging tugs. But I knew the
                    gut was sound this time, and as I fancied he had risen to the sniggler, I had no
                    anxiety about the tackle holding. One more plunge, and back came the line as
                    before. He was off. One could have sat down and gnawed the reel. What had gone
                    wrong? Why, the brute had taken the old fly from the farmhouse and had snapped
                    the loop that attaches the gut. The little loop was still on the fragment of
                    minnow tackle which fastened it to the cast.</p>

                <p>There was no more chance, for there were <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0183" n="138"
                    /> now no more flies, except a small "cobbery," a sea-trout fly from the Sound
                    of Mull. It was time for us to go, with a heavy heart and a basket empty, except
                    for two or three miserable trout. The loss of those two salmon, whether big or
                    little fish, was not the whole misfortune. All the chances of the day were gone,
                    and seldom have salmon risen so freely. I had not been casting long enough to
                    smoke half a cigarette, when I hooked each of those fish. They rose at flies
                    which were the exact opposites of each other in size, character, and colour.
                    They were ready to rise at anything but the sniggler. And I had nothing to offer
                    them, absolutely nothing bigger than a small red-spinner from the Test. On that
                    day a fisher, not far off, hooked nine salmon and landed four of them, in one
                    pool, I never had such a chance before; the heavy flood and high wind had made
                    the salmon as "silly" as perch. One might have caught half a dozen of the great
                    sturdy fellows, who make all trout, even sea-trout, seem despicable minnows.
                    Next day I fished again in the same water, with a friend. I rose a <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0184" n="139"/> fish, but did not hook it, and he
                    landed a small one, five minutes after we started, and we only had one other
                    rise all the rest of the day. Probably it was not dark and windy enough, but who
                    can explain the caprices of salmon? The only certain thing is, that carelessness
                    always brings misfortune; that if your tackle is weak fish will hook themselves
                    on days, and in parts of the water, where you expected nothing, and then will go
                    away with your fly and your casting-lines. Fortune never forgives. He who is
                    lazy, and takes no trouble because he expects no fish, will always be meeting
                    heart-breaking adventures. One should never make a hopeless or careless cast;
                    bad luck lies in wait for that kind of performance. These are the experiences
                    that embitter a man, as they embittered Dean Swift, who, old and ill, neglected
                    and in Irish exile, still felt the pang of losing a great trout when he was a
                    boy. What pleasure is there in landscape and tradition when such accidents
                    befall you?</p>

                <lg type="couplet">
                    <l>The sun upon the Weirdlaw hill,</l>

                <p>There is a fire of autumn colour in the tufted woods that embosom Fernilea.
                    "Bother the setting sun," we say, and the Maid of Neidpath, and the "Flowers of
                    the Forest," and the memories of Scott at Ashiesteil, and of Muckle Mou'd Meg,
                    at Elibank. These are filmy, shadowy pleasures of the fancy, these cannot
                    minister to the mind of him who has been "broken" twice, who cannot resume the
                    contest for want of ammunition, and who has not even brought the
                    creature-comfort of a flask. Since that woful day I have lain on the bank and
                    watched excellent anglers skilfully flogging the best of water, and that water
                    full of fish, without hooking one. Salmon-fishing, then, is a matter of chance,
                    or of plodding patience. They will rise on one day at almost any fly (but the
                    sniggler), however ill-presented to them. On a dozen other days no fly and no
                    skill will avail to tempt them. The salmon is a brainless brute and the grapes
                    are sour!</p>

                <p>If only the gut had held, this sketch would have ended with sentiment, and a
                    sunset, and the music of Ettrick, the melody of Tweed. In <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0186" n="141"/> the gloaming we'd be roaming
                    homeward, telling, perhaps, the story of the ghost seen by Sir Walter Scott near
                    Ashiesteil, or discussing the Roman treasure still buried near Oakwood Tower,
                    under an inscribed stone which men saw fifty years ago. Or was it a treasure of
                    Michael Scott's, who lived at Oakwood, says tradition? Let Harden dig for
                    Harden's gear, it is not for me to give hints as to its whereabouts. After all
                    that ill- luck, to be brief, one is not in the vein for legendary lore, nor
                    memories of boyhood, nor poetry, nor sunsets. I do not believe that one ever
                    thinks of the landscape or of anything else, while there is a chance for a fish,
                    and no abundance of local romance can atone for an empty creel. Poetical fishers
                    try to make people believe these fallacies; perhaps they impose on themselves;
                    but if one would really enjoy landscape, one should leave, not only the fly-book
                    and the landing-net, but the rod and reel at home. And so farewell to the
                    dearest and fairest of all rivers that go on earth, fairer than Eurotas or
                    Sicilian Anapus with its sea-trout; farewell--for who knows how long?--to the

                <head>THE DOUBLE ALIBI</head>
                <p>Glen Aline is probably the loneliest place in the lone moorlands of Western
                    Galloway. The country is entirely pastoral, and I fancy that the very pasture is
                    bad enough. Stretches of deer-grass and ling, rolling endlessly to the feet of
                    Cairnsmure and the circle of the eastern hills, cannot be good feeding for <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0189" n="144"/> the least Epicurean of sheep, and
                    sheep do not care for the lank and sour herbage by the sides of the "lanes," as
                    the half-stagnant, black, deep, and weedy burns are called in this part of the
                    country. The scenery is not unattractive, but tourists never wander to these
                    wastes where no inns are, and even the angler seldom visits them. Indeed, the
                    fishing is not to be called good, and the "lanes," which "seep," as the Scotch
                    say, through marshes and beneath low hillsides, are not such excellent company
                    as the garrulous and brawling brooks of the Border or of the Highlands. As the
                    lanes flow, however, from far-away lochs, it happens that large trout make their
                    way into them--trout which, if hooked, offer a gallant resistance before they
                    can be hauled over the weeds that usually line the watercourses.</p>

                <p>Partly for the sake of trying this kind of angling, partly from a temporary
                    distaste for the presence of men and women, partly for the purpose of finishing
                    a work styled "A History of the Unexplained," I once spent a month in the
                    solitudes <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0190" n="145"/> of Glen Aline. I stayed at
                    the house of a shepherd who, though not an unintelligent man was by no means
                    possessed of the modern spirit. He and his brother swains had sturdily and
                    successfully resisted an attempt made by the schoolmaster at a village some
                    seven miles off to get a postal service in the glen more frequently than once a
                    week. A post once a week was often enough for lucky people who did not get
                    letters twice a year. It was not my shepherd, but another, who once came with
                    his wife to the village, after a twelve miles' walk across the hills, to ask
                    "what the day of the week was?" They had lost count, and the man had attended to
                    his work on a day which the dame averred to be the Sabbath. He denied that it
                        <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the Sabbath, and I believe that it turned out to
                    be a Tuesday. This little incident gives some idea of the delightful absence of
                    population in Glen Aline. But no words can paint the utter loneliness, which
                    could actually be felt--the empty moors, the empty sky. The heaps of stones by a
                    burnside, here and there, showed that a cottage had once existed where now <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0191" n="146"/> was no habitation. One such spot was
                    rather to be shunned by the superstitious, for here, about 1698, a cottar family
                    had been evicted by endless unaccountable disturbances in the house. Stones were
                    thrown by invisible hands--though occasionally, by the way, a white hand, with
                    no apparent body attached to it, <hi rend="italic">was</hi> viewed by the
                    curious who came to the spot. Heavy objects of all sorts floated in the air;
                    rappings and voices were heard; the end wall was pulled down by an unknown
                    agency. The story is extant in a pious old pamphlet called "Sadducees Defeated,"
                    and a great deal more to the same effect--a masterpiece by the parish minister,
                    signed and attested by the other ministers of the Glen Kens. The Edinburgh
                    edition of the pamphlet is rare; the London edition may be procured without much
                    difficulty.</p>

                <p>The site of this ruined cottage, however, had no terrors for the neighbours, or
                    rather for the neighbour, my shepherd. In fact, he seemed to have forgotten the
                    legend till I reminded him of it, for I had come across the tale in my
                    researches into the Unexplained. The shepherd and his <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0192" n="147"/> family, indeed, were quite devoid of
                    superstition, and in this respect very unlike the northern Highlanders. However,
                    the fallen cottage had nothing to do with my own little adventure in Glen Aline,
                    and I mention it merely as the most notable of the tiny ruins which attest the
                    presence, in the past, of a larger population. One cannot marvel that the people
                    "flitted" from the moors and morasses of Glen Aline into less melancholy
                    neighbourhoods. The very sheep seemed scarcer here than elsewhere;
                    grouse-disease had devastated the moors, sportsmen consequently did not visit
                    them; and only a few barren pairs, with crow- picked skeletons of dead birds in
                    the heather now and then, showed that the shootings had once perhaps been
                    marketable. My shepherd's cottage was four miles from the little-travelled road
                    to Dalmellington; long bad miles they were, across bog and heather. Consequently
                    I seldom saw any face of man, except in or about the cottage. My work went on
                    rapidly enough in such an undisturbed life. Empires might fall, parties might
                    break like bursting shells, and banks might break <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0193" n="148"/> also: I plodded on with my labour,
                    and went a-fishing when the day promised well. There was a hill loch (Loch Nan)
                    about five miles away, which I favoured a good deal. The trout were large and
                    fair of flesh, and in proper weather they rose pretty freely, and could be taken
                    by an angler wading from the shore. There was no boat. The wading, however, was
                    difficult and dangerous, owing to the boggy nature of the bottom, which quaked
                    like a quicksand in some places. The black water, never stirred by duck or
                    moorhen, the dry rustling reeds, the noisome smell of decaying vegetable-matter
                    when you stirred it up in wading, the occasional presence of a dead sheep by the
                    sullen margin of the tarn, were all opposed to cheerfulness. Still, the fish
                    were there, and the "lane," which sulkily glided from the loch towards the
                    distant river, contained some monsters, which took worm after a flood. One misty
                    morning, as I had just topped the low ridge from which the loch became visible,
                    I saw a man fishing from my favourite bench. Never had I noticed a human being
                    there before, and I was not well pleased to <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0194"
                        n="149"/> think that some emissary of Mr. Watson Lyall was making
                    experiments in Loch Nan, and would describe it in "The Sportsman's Guide." The
                    mist blew white and thick for a minute or two over the loch- side, as it often
                    does at Loch Skene; so white and thick and sudden that the bewildered angler
                    there is apt to lose his way, and fall over the precipice of the Grey Mare's
                    Tail. When the curtain of cloud rose again, the loch was lonely: the angler had
                    disappeared. I went on rejoicing, and made a pretty good basket, as the weather
                    improved and grew warmer--a change which gives an appetite to trout in some hill
                    lochs. Among the sands between the stones on the farther bank I found traces of
                    the angler's footsteps; he was not a phantom, at all events, for phantoms do not
                    wear heavily nailed boots, as he evidently did. The traces, which were soon
                    lost, of course, inclined me to think that he had retreated up a narrow green
                    burnside, with rather high banks, through which, in rainy weather, a small
                    feeder fell into the loch. I guessed that he had been frightened away by the
                    descent of the mist, which <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0195" n="150"/> usually
                    "puts down" the trout and prevents them from feeding. In that case his alarm was
                    premature. I marched homewards, happy with the unaccustomed weight of my basket,
                    the contents of which were a welcome change from the usual porridge and
                    potatoes, tea (without milk), jam, and scones of the shepherd's table. But, as I
                    reached the height above the loch on my westward path, and looked back to see if
                    rising fish were dimpling the still waters, all flushed as they were with
                    sunset, behold, there was the Other Man at work again!</p>

                <p>I should have thought no more about him had I not twice afterwards seen him at a
                    distance, fishing up a "lane" ahead of me, in the loneliest regions, and
                    thereby, of course, spoiling my sport. I knew him by his peculiar stoop, which
                    seemed not unfamiliar to me, and by his hat, which was of the clerical pattern
                    once known, perhaps still known, as "a Bible- reader's"--a low, soft, slouched
                    black felt. The second time that I found him thus anticipating me, I left off
                    fishing and walked rather briskly towards him, to satisfy my curiosity, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0196" n="151"/> and ask the usual questions, "What
                    sport?" and "What flies?" But as soon as he observed me coming he strode off
                    across the heather. Uncourteous as it seems, I felt so inquisitive that I
                    followed him. But he walked so rapidly, and was so manifestly anxious to shake
                    me off, that I gave up the pursuit. Even if he were a poacher whose conscience
                    smote him for using salmon-roe, I was not "my brother's keeper," nor anybody's
                    keeper. He might "otter" the loch, but how could I prevent him?</p>

                <p>It was no affair of mine, and yet--where had I seen him before? His gait, his
                    stoop, the carriage of his head, all seemed familiar--but a short-sighted man is
                    accustomed to this kind of puzzle: he is always recognising the wrong person,
                    when he does not fail to recognise the right one.</p>

                <p>I am rather short-sighted, but science has its resources. Two or three days after
                    my encounter with this very shy sportsman, I went again to Loch Nan. But this
                    time I took with me a strong field-glass. As I neared the crest of the low
                    heathery slope immediately above the loch, whence the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0197" n="152"/> water first comes into view, I lay
                    down on the ground and crawled like a deer-stalker to the skyline.</p>

                <p>Then I got out the glass and reconnoitred. There was my friend, sure enough;
                    moreover, he was playing a very respectable trout. But he was fishing on the
                    near side of the loch, and though I had quite a distinct view of his back, and
                    indeed of all his attenuated form, I was as far as ever from recognising him, or
                    guessing where, if anywhere, I had seen him before. I now determined to stalk
                    him; but this was not too easy, as there is literally no cover on the hillside
                    except a long march dyke of the usual loose stones, which ran down to the
                    loch-side, and indeed three or four feet into the loch, reaching it at a short
                    distance to the right of the angler. Behind this I skulked, in an eagerly
                    undignified manner, and was just about to climb the wall unobserved, when two
                    grouse got up, with their wild "cluck cluck" of alarm, and flew down past the
                    angler and over the loch. He did not even look round, but jerked his line out of
                    the water, reeled it up, and set off walking <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0198"
                        n="153"/> along the loch-side. He was making, no doubt, for the little glen
                    up which I fancied that he must have retreated on the first occasion when saw
                    him. I set off walking round the tarn on my own side--the left side--expecting
                    to anticipate him, and that he must pass me on his way up the little burnside.
                    But I had miscalculated the distance, or the pace. He was first at the burnside;
                    and now I cast courtesy and everything but curiosity to the winds, and
                    deliberately followed him. He was a few score of yards ahead of me, walking
                    rapidly, when he suddenly climbed the burnside to the left, and was lost to my
                    eyes for a few moments. I reached the place, ascended the steep green declivity
                    and found myself on the open undulating moor, with no human being in sight!</p>

                <p>The grass and heather were short. I saw no bush, no hollow, where he could by any
                    possibility have hidden himself. Had he met a Boojum he could not have more
                    "softly and suddenly vanished away."</p>

                <p>I make no pretence of being more courageous than my neighbours, and, in this
                    juncture, perhaps <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0199" n="154"/> I was less so. The
                    long days of loneliness in waste Glen Aline, and too many solitary cigarettes,
                    had probably injured my nerve. So, when I suddenly heard a sigh and the
                    half-smothered sound of a convulsive cough-hollow, if ever a cough was
                    hollow--hard by me, at my side as it were, and yet could behold no man, nor any
                    place where a man might conceal himself--nothing but moor and sky and tufts of
                    rushes--then I turned away, and walked down the glen: not slowly. I shall not
                    deny that I often looked over my shoulder as I went, and that, when I reached
                    the loch, I did not angle without many a backward glance. Such an appearance and
                    disappearance as this, I remembered, were in the experience of Sir Walter Scott.
                    Lockhart does not tell the anecdote, which is in a little anonymous volume,
                    "Recollections of Sir Walter Scott," published before Lockhart's book. Sir
                    Walter reports that he was once riding across the moor to Ashiesteil, in the
                    clear brown summer twilight, after sunset. He saw a man a little way ahead of
                    him, but, just before he reached the spot, the man disappeared. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0200" n="155"/> Scott rode about and about, searching
                    the low heather as I had done, but to no purpose. He rode on, and, glancing
                    back, saw the same man at the same place. He turned his horse, galloped to the
                    spot, and again--nothing! "Then," says Sir Walter, "neither the mare nor I cared
                    to wait any longer." Neither had I cared to wait, and if there is any shame in
                    the confession, on my head be it!</p>

                <p>There came a week of blazing summer weather; tramping over moors to lochs like
                    sheets of burnished steel was out of the question, and I worked at my book,
                    which now was all but finished. At length I wrote THE END, and "o le bon ouff!
                    que je poussais," as Flaubert says about one of his own laborious conclusions.
                    The weather broke, we had a deluge, and then came a soft cloudy day, with a warm
                    southern wind suggesting a final march on Loch Nan. I packed some scones and
                    marmalade into my creel, filled my flask with whiskey, my cigarette-case with
                    cigarettes, and started on the familiar track with the happiest anticipations.
                    The Lone Fisher was <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0201" n="156"/> quite out of my
                    mind; the day was exhilarating--one of those true fishing- days when you feel
                    the presence of the sun without seeing him. Still, I looked rather cautiously
                    over the edge of the slope above the loch, and, by Jove! there he was, fishing
                    the near side, and wading deep among the reeds! I did not stalk him this time,
                    but set off running down the hillside behind him, as quickly as my basket, with
                    its load of waders and boots, would permit. I was within forty yards of him,
                    when he gave a wild stagger, tried to recover himself, failed, and, this time,
                    disappeared in a perfectly legitimate and accountable manner. The treacherous
                    peaty bottom had given way, and his floating hat, with a splash on the surface,
                    and a few black bubbles, were all that testified to his existence. There was a
                    broken old paling hard by; I tore off a long plank, waded in as near as I dared,
                    and, by help of the plank, after a good deal of slipping, which involved an
                    exemplary drenching, I succeeded in getting him on to dry land. He was a
                    distressing spectacle--his body and face all blackened with the slimy peat-mud;
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0202" n="157"/> and he fell half-fainting on the
                    grass, convulsed by a terrible cough. My first care was to give him whiskey, by
                    perhaps a mistaken impulse of humanity; my next, as he lay, exhausted, was to
                    bring water in my hat, and remove the black mud from his face.</p>

                <p>Then I saw Percy Allen--Allen of St. Jude's! His face was wasted, his thin long
                    beard (he had not worn a beard of old), clogged as it was with peat-stains,
                    showed flecks of grey.</p>

                <p>"Allen--Percy!" I said; "what wind blew <hi rend="italic">you</hi> here?"</p>

                <p>But he did not answer; and, as he coughed, it was too plain that the shock of his
                    accident had broken some vessel in the lungs. I tended him as well as I knew how
                    to do it. I sat beside him, giving him what comfort I might, and all the time my
                    memory flew back to college days, and to our strange and most unhappy last
                    meeting, and his subsequent inevitable disgrace. Far away from here--Loch Nan
                    and the vacant moors--my memory wandered.</p>

                <p>It was at Blocksby's auction-room, in a street <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0203"
                        n="158"/> near the Strand, on the eve of a great book-sale three years
                    before, that we had met, for almost the last time, as I believed, though it is
                    true that we had not spoken on that occasion. It is necessary that I should
                    explain what occurred, or what I and three other credible witnesses believed to
                    have occurred; for, upon my word, the more I see and hear of human evidence of
                    any event, the less do I regard it as establishing anything better than an
                    excessively probable hypothesis.</p>

                <p>To make a long story as short as may be, I should say that Allen and I had been
                    acquainted when we were undergraduates; that, when fellows of our respective
                    colleges, our acquaintance had become intimate; that we had once shared a little
                    bit of fishing on the Test; and that we were both book-collectors. I was a
                    comparatively sane bibliomaniac, but to Allen the time came when he grudged
                    every penny that he did not spend on rare books, and when he actually gave up
                    his share of the water we used to take together, that his contribution to the
                    rent might go for rare editions and bindings. After this deplorable <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0204" n="159"/> change of character we naturally saw
                    each other less, but we were still friendly. I went up to town to scribble;
                    Allen stayed on at Oxford. One day I chanced to go into Blocksby's rooms; it was
                    a Friday, I remember--there was to be a great sale on the Monday. There I met
                    Allen in ecstasies over one of the books displayed in the little side room on
                    the right hand of the sale- room. He had taken out of a glass case and was
                    gloating over a book which, it seems, had long been the Blue Rose of his fancy
                    as a collector. He was crazed about Longepierre, the old French amateur, whose
                    volumes, you may remember, were always bound in blue morocco, and tooled, on the
                    centre and at the corners, with his badge, the Golden Fleece. Now the tome which
                    so fascinated Allen was a Theocritus, published at Rome by Caliergus--a
                    Theocritus on blue paper, if you please, bound in Longepierre's morocco livery,
                        <hi rend="italic">double</hi> with red morocco, and, oh ecstasy! with a copy
                    of Longepierre's version of one Idyll on the flyleaf, signed with the
                    translator's initials, and headed "<hi rend="italic">a Mon Roy</hi>." It is
                    known to the curious that <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0205" n="160"/> Louis XIV.
                    particularly admired and praised this little poem, calling it "a model of
                    honourable gallantry." Clearly the grateful author had presented his own copy to
                    the king; and here it was, when king and crown had gone down into dust.</p>

                <p>Allen showed me the book; he could hardly let it leave his hands.</p>

                <p>"Here is a pearl," he had said, "a gem beyond price!"</p>

                <p>"I'm afraid you'll find it so," I said; "that is for a Paillet or Rothschild, not
                    for you, my boy."</p>

                <p>"I fear so," he had answered; "if I were to sell my whole library to-morrow, I
                    could hardly raise the money;" for he was poor, and it was rumoured that his
                    mania had already made him acquainted with the Jews.</p>

                <p>We parted. I went home to chambers; Allen stayed adoring the unexampled
                    Longepierre. That night I dined out, and happened to sit next a young lady who
                    possessed a great deal of taste, though that was the least of her charms. The
                    fashion for book-collecting was among her innocent pleasures; she had seen
                    Allen's books at <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0206" n="161"/> Oxford, and I told
                    her of his longings for the Theocritus. Miss Breton at once was eager to see the
                    book, and the other books, and I obtained leave to go with her and Mrs. Breton
                    to the auction-rooms next day. The little side-room where the treasures were
                    displayed was empty, except for an attendant, when we went in; we looked at the
                    things and made learned remarks, but I admit that I was more concerned to look
                    at Miss Breton than at any work in leather by Derome or Bauzonnet. We were thus
                    a good deal occupied, perhaps, with each other; people came and went, while our
                    heads were bent over a case of volumes under the window. When we <hi
                        rend="italic">did</hi> leave, on the appeal of Mrs. Breton, we both--both I
                    and Kate--Miss Breton, I mean--saw Allen--at least I saw him, and believed <hi
                        rend="italic">she</hi> did--absorbed in gazing at the Longepierre
                    Theocritus. He held it rather near his face; the gas, which had been lit, fell
                    on the shining Golden Fleeces of the cover, on his long thin hands and eager
                    studious features. It would have been a pity to disturb him in his ecstasy. I
                    looked at Miss <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0207" n="162"/> Breton; we both
                    smiled, and, of course, I presumed we smiled for the same reason.</p>

                <p>I happen to know, and unluckily did it happen, the very minute of the hour when
                    we left Blocksby's. It was a quarter to four o'clock--a church- tower was
                    chiming the three-quarters in the Strand, and I looked half mechanically at my
                    own watch, which was five minutes fast. On Sunday I went down to Oxford, and
                    happened to walk into Allen's rooms. He was lying on a sofa reading the
                    "Spectator." After chatting a little, I said, "You took no notice of me, nor of
                    the Bretons yesterday, Allen, at Blocksby's."</p>

                <p>"I didn't see you," he said; and as he was speaking there came a knock at the
                    door.</p>

                <p>"Come in!" cried Allen, and a man entered who was a stranger to me. You would not
                    have called him a gentleman perhaps. However, I admit that I am possibly no
                    great judge of a gentleman.</p>

                <p>Allen looked up.</p>

                <p>"Hullo, Mr. Thomas," he said, "have you come up to see Mr. Mortby?" mentioning a
                    well-known <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0208" n="163"/> Oxford bibliophile.
                    "Wharton," he went on, addressing me, "this is Mr. Thomas from Blocksby's." I
                    bowed. Mr. Thomas seemed embarrassed. "Can I have a word alone with you, sir?"
                    he murmured to Allen.</p>

                <p>"Certainly," answered Allen, looking rather surprised. "You'll excuse me a
                    moment, Wharton," he said to me. "Stop and lunch, won't you? There's the old
                    'Spectator' for you;" and he led Mr. Thomas into a small den where he used to
                    hear his pupils read their essays, and so forth.</p>

                <p>In a few minutes he came out, looking rather pale, and took an embarrassed
                    farewell of Mr. Thomas.</p>

                <p>"Look here, Wharton," he said to me, "here is a curious business. That fellow
                    from Blocksby's tells me that the Longepierre Theocritus disappeared yesterday
                    afternoon; that I was the last person in whose hand it was seen, and that not
                    only the man who always attends in the room but Lord Tarras and Mr. Wentworth,
                    saw it in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hands just before it was missed."</p>

                <p>"What a nuisance!" I answered. "You were <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0209" n="164"
                    /> looking at it when Miss Breton and I saw you, and you didn't notice us; Does
                    Thomas know <hi rend="italic">when</hi>--I mean about what o'clock--the book was
                    first missed?"</p>

                <p>"That's the lucky part of the whole worry," said Allen. "I left the rooms at
                    three exactly, and it was missed about ten minutes to four; dozens of people
                    must have handled it in that interval of time. So interesting a book!"</p>

                <p>"But," I said, and paused--"are you sure your watch was right?"</p>

                <p>"Quite certain; besides, I looked at a church clock. Why on earth do you ask?"</p>

                <p>"Because--I am awfully sorry--there is some unlucky muddle; but it was exactly a
                    quarter, or perhaps seventeen minutes, to four when both Miss Breton and I saw
                    you absorbed in the Longepierre."</p>

                <p>"Oh, it's quite <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi>," Allen answered; "I was far
                    enough away from Blocksby's at a quarter to four."</p>

                <p>"That's all right," I said. "Of course you can prove that; if it is necessary;
                    though I dare say <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0210" n="165"/> the book has fallen
                    behind a row of others, and has been found by this time. Where were you at a
                    quarter to four?"</p>

                <p>"I really don't feel obliged to stand a cross-examination before my time,"
                    answered Allen, flushing a little. Then I remembered that I was engaged to lunch
                    at All Souls', which was true enough; convenient too, for I do not quite see how
                    the conversation could have been carried on pleasantly much further. For I <hi
                        rend="italic">had</hi> seen him--not a doubt about it. But there was one
                    curious thing. Next time I met Miss Breton I told her the story, and said, "You
                    remember how we saw Allen, at Blocksby's, just as we were going away?"</p>

                <p>"No," she said, "I did not see him; where was he?"</p>

                <p>"Then why did you smile--don't you remember? I looked at him and at you, and I
                    thought you smiled!"</p>

                <p>"Because--well, I suppose because <hi rend="italic">you</hi> smiled," she said.
                    And the subject of the conversation was changed.</p>

                <p>It was an excessively awkward affair. It did <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0211"
                        n="166"/> not come "before the public," except, of course, in the agreeably
                    mythical gossip of an evening paper. There was no more public scandal than that.
                    Allen was merely ruined. The matter was introduced to the notice of the Wardens
                    and the other Fellows of St. Jude's. What Lord Tarras saw, what Mr. Wentworth
                    saw, what I saw, clearly proved that Allen was in the auction- rooms, and had
                    the confounded book in his hand, at an hour when, as <hi rend="italic">he</hi>
                    asserted, he had left the place for some time. It was admitted by one of the
                    people employed at the sale-rooms that Allen had been noticed (he was well known
                    there) leaving the house at three. But he must have come back again, of course,
                    as at least four people could have sworn to his presence in the show-room at a
                    quarter to four o'clock. When he was asked in a private interview, by the Head
                    of his College, to say where he went after leaving Blocksby's Allen refused to
                    answer. He merely said that he could not prove the facts; that his own word
                    would not be taken against that of so many unprejudiced and even friendly
                    witnesses. He simply threw up the <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0212" n="167"/>
                    game. He resigned his fellowship; he took his name off the books; he
                    disappeared.</p>

                <p>There was a good deal of talk; people spoke about the unscrupulousness of
                    collectors, and repeated old anecdotes on that subject. Then the business was
                    forgotten. Next, in a year's time or so, the book--the confounded Longepierre's
                    Theocritus--was found in a pawnbroker's shop. The history of its adventures was
                    traced beyond a shadow of doubt. It had been very adroitly stolen, and disposed
                    of, by a notorious book-thief, a gentleman by birth--now dead, but well
                    remembered. Ask Mr. Quaritch!</p>

                <p>Allen's absolute innocence was thus demonstrated beyond cavil, though nobody paid
                    any particular attention to the demonstration. As for Allen, he had vanished; he
                    was heard of no more.</p>

                <p>He was <hi rend="italic">here</hi>; dying here, beside the black wave of lone
                    Loch Nan.</p>

                <p>All this, so long in the telling, I had time enough to think over, as I sat and
                    watched him, and wiped his lips with water from the burn, clearer and sweeter
                    than the water of the loch.</p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0213" n="168"/>

                <p>At last his fit of coughing ceased, and a kind of peace came into his face.</p>

                <p>"Allen, my dear old boy," I said--I don't often use the language of
                    affection--"did you never hear that all that stupid story was cleared up; that
                    everyone knows you are innocent?"</p>

                <p>He only shook his head; he did not dare to speak, but he looked happier, and he
                    put his hand in mine.</p>

                <p>I sat holding his hand, stroking it. I don't know how long I sat there; I had put
                    my coat and waterproof under him. He was "wet through," of course; there was
                    little use in what I did. What could I do with him? how bring him to a warm and
                    dry place?</p>

                <p>The idea seemed to strike him, for he half rose and pointed to the little
                    burnside, across the loch. A plan occurred to me; I tore a leaf from my
                    sketch-book, put the paper with pencil in his hand, and said, "Where do you
                    live? Don't speak. Write."</p>

                <p>He wrote in a faint scrawl, "Help me to that burnside. Then I can guide you."</p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0214" n="169"/>

                <p>I hardly know how I got him there, for, light as he was, I am no Hercules.
                    However, with many a rest, we reached the little dell; and then I carried him up
                    its green side, and laid him on the heather of the moor.</p>

                <p>He wrote again:</p>

                <p>"Go to that clump of rushes--the third from the little hillock. Then look, but be
                    careful. Then lift the big grass tussock."</p>

                <p>The spot which Allen indicated was on the side of a rather steep grassy slope. I
                    approached it, dragged at the tussock of grass, which came away easily enough,
                    and revealed the entrance to no more romantic hiding-place than an old secret
                    whiskey "still." Private stills, not uncommon in Sutherland and some other
                    northern shires, are extinct in Galloway. Allen had probably found this one by
                    accident in his wanderings, and in his half-insane bitterness against mankind
                    had made it, for some time at least, his home. The smoke-blackened walls, the
                    recesses where the worm- tub and the still now stood, all plainly enough
                    betrayed the original user of the hiding-place. There was <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002617_0215" n="170"/> a low bedstead, a shelf or two,
                    whereon lay a few books--a Shakespeare, a Homer, a Walton, Plutarch's "Lives";
                    very little else out of a library once so rich. There was a tub of oatmeal, a
                    heap of dry peat, two or three eggs in a plate, some bottles, a keg of whiskey,
                    some sardine-tins, a box with clothes--that was nearly all the "plenishing" of
                    this hermitage. It was never likely to be discovered, except by the smoke, when
                    the inmate lit a fire. The local shepherd knew it, of course, but Allen had
                    bought his silence, not that there were many neighbours for the shepherd to
                    tattle with.</p>

                <p>Allen had recovered strength enough by this time to reach his den with little
                    assistance. He made me beat up the white of one of the eggs with a little
                    turpentine, which was probably, under the circumstances, the best styptic for
                    his malady within his reach. I lit his fire of peats, undressed him, put him to
                    bed, and made him as comfortable as might be in the den which he had chosen.
                    Then I went back to the shepherd's, sent a messenger to the nearest doctor, and
                    procured a kind <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0216" n="171"/> of sledge, generally
                    used for dragging peat home, wherein, with abundance of blankets for covering, I
                    hoped to bring Allen back to the shepherd's cottage.</p>

                <p>Not to delay over details, this was managed at last, and the unhappy fellow was
                    under a substantial roof. But he was very ill; he became delirious and raved of
                    many things--talked of old college adventures, bid recklessly for imaginary
                    books, and practised other eccentricities of fever.</p>

                <p>When his fever left him he was able to converse in a way--I talking, and he
                    scrawling faintly with a pencil on paper. I told him how his character had been
                    cleared, how he had been hunted for, advertised for, vainly enough. To the
                    shepherds' cottages where he had lived till the beginning of that summer,
                    newspapers rarely came; to his den in the old secret still, of course they never
                    came at all.</p>

                <p>His own story of what he had been doing at the fatal hour when so many people saw
                    him at the auction-rooms was brief. He had left the rooms, as he said, at three
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0217" n="172"/> o'clock, pondering how he might
                    raise money for the book on which his heart was set. His feet had taken him,
                    half unconsciously, to</p>

                <lg>
                    <l>a dismal court,</l>
                    <l>Place of Israelite resort,</l>
                </lg>

                <p>where dwelt and dealt one Isaacs, from whom he had, at various times, borrowed
                    money on usury. The name of Isaacs was over a bell, one of many at the door,
                    and, when the bell was rung, the street door "opened of his own accord," like
                    that of the little tobacco-and-talk club which used to exist in an alley off
                    Pall Mall. Allen rang the bell, the outer door opened, and, as he was standing
                    at the door of Isaacs' chambers, before he had knocked, <hi rend="italic"
                    >that</hi> portal also opened, and the office-boy, a young Jew, slunk cautiously
                    out. On seeing Allen, he had seemed at once surprised and alarmed. Allen asked
                    if his master was in; the lad answered "No" in a hesitating way; but on second
                    thoughts, averred that Isaacs "would be back immediately," and requested Allen
                    to go in and wait. He did so, but Isaacs never came, and Allen fell asleep. He
                    had a very distinct and <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0218" n="173"/> singular
                    dream, he said, of being in Messrs. Blocksy's rooms, of handling the
                    Longepierre, and of seeing Wentworth there, and Lord Tarras. When he wakened he
                    was very cold, and, of course, it was pitch dark. He did not remember where he
                    was; he lit a match and a candle on the chimney-piece. Then slowly his memory
                    came back to him, and not only his memory, but his consciousness of what he had
                    wholly forgotten--namely, that this was Saturday, the Sabbath of the Jews, and
                    that there was not the faintest chance of Isaacs' arrival at his place of
                    business. In the same moment the embarrassment and confusion of the young
                    Israelite flashed vividly across his mind, and he saw that he was in a very
                    awkward position. If that fair Hebrew boy had been robbing, or trying to rob,
                    the till, then Allen's position was serious indeed, as here he was, alone, at an
                    untimely hour, in the office. So he blew the candle out, and went down the dingy
                    stairs as quietly as possible, took the first cab he met, drove to Paddington,
                    and went up to Oxford.</p>

                <p>It is probable that the young child of Israel, <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0219"
                        n="174"/> if he had been attempting any mischief, did not succeed in it. Had
                    there been any trouble, it is likely enough that he would have involved Allen in
                    the grief. Then Allen would have been in a, perhaps, unprecedented position. He
                    could have established an alibi, as far as the Jew's affairs went, by proving
                    that he had been at Blocksby's at the hour when the boy would truthfully have
                    sworn that he had let him into Isaacs' chambers. And, as far as the charge
                    against him at Blocksby's went, the evidence of the young Jew would have gone to
                    prove that he was at Isaacs', where he had no business to be, when we saw him at
                    Blocksby's. But, unhappily, each alibi would have been almost equally
                    compromising. The difficulty never arose, but the reason why Allen refused to
                    give any account of what he had been doing, and where he had been, at four
                    o'clock on that Saturday afternoon--a refusal that told so heavily against
                    him--is now sufficiently clear. His statement would, we may believe, never have
                    been corroborated by the youthful Hebrew, who certainly had his own excellent
                    reasons for silence, and who <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0220" n="175"/> probably
                    had carefully established an <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi> of his own elsewhere.</p>

                <p>The true account of Allen's appearance, or apparition, at Blocksby's, when I and
                    Tarras, Wentworth and the attendant recognised him, and Miss Breton did <hi
                        rend="italic">not</hi>, is thus part of the History of the Unexplained.
                    Allen might have appealed to precedents in the annals of the Psychical Society,
                    where they exist in scores, and are technically styled "collective
                    hallucinations." But neither a jury, nor a judge, perhaps, would accept the
                    testimony of experts in Psychical Research if offered in a criminal trial, nor
                    acquit a wraith.</p>

                <p>Possibly this scepticism has never yet injured the cause of an innocent man. Yet
                    I know, in my own personal experience, and have heard from others, from men of
                    age, sagacity, and acquaintance with the greatest affairs, instances in which
                    people have been distinctly seen by sane, healthy, and honourable witnesses, in
                    places and circumstances where it was (as we say) "physically impossible" that
                    they should have been, and where they certainly <pb entity="DSSR_000002617_0221"
                        n="176"/> were not themselves aware of having been. That is why human
                    testimony seems to me to establish no more, in certain circumstances, than a
                    highly probable working hypothesis--a hypothesis on which, of course, we are
                    bound to act.</p>

                <p>There is little more to tell. By dint of careful nursing, poor Allen was enabled
                    to travel; he reached Mentone, and there the mistral ended him. He was a lonely
                    man, with no kinsfolk; his character was cleared among the people who knew him
                    best; the others have forgotten him. Nobody can be injured by this explanation
                    of his silence when called on to prove his innocence, and of his unusually
                    successful vanishing from a society which had never tried very hard to discover
                    him in his retreat. He has lived and suffered and died, and left behind him
                    little but an incident in the History of the Unexplained.</p>
