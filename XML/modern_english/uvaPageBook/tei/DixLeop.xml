                  appear in the 1902 and (2) the 1903 does not include the photographs opposite
                  pages 88 and 378 of the 1902&#x2014;these have been scanned from the 1902
                  edition and included in the electronic text.</p>

            <head> Historical Note </head>

            <p>In answer to hundreds of letters, I wish to say that all the incidents need in Book
               I., which is properly the of my story, were selected from authentic records, or came
               within my personal knowledge. </p>
            <p> The only serious liberty I have taken with history is to tone down the facts to make
               them credible in fiction. The village of "Hambright" is my birthplace, and is located
               near the center of "Military District No. 2," comprising the Carolinas, which were
               destroyed at States by an Act of Congress in 1867. It will be a century yet before
               people outside the South can be made to believe a literal statement of the history of
               those times. </p>
            <p>I tried to write this book with the utmost restraint. </p>

               <head> CHAPTER II<lb/> A LIGHT SHINING IN DARKNESS </head>

               <p>In the rear of Mrs. Gaston's place, there stood in the midst of an orchard a log
                  house of two rooms, with hallway between them. There was a mud-thatched wooden
                  chimney at each end, and from the back of the hallway a kitchen extension of the
                  same material with another mud chimney. The house stood in the middle of a ten
                  acre lot, and a woman was busy in the garden with a little girl, planting seed. </p>
               <p>"Hurry up Annie, less finish this in time to fix up a fine dinner er greens and
                  turnips an 'taters an a chicken. Yer Pappy 'll get home to-day sure. Colonel
                  Gaston's Nelse come last night. Yer Pappy was in the Colonel's regiment an' Nelse
                  said he passed him on the road comin' with two one-legged soldiers. He ain't got
                  but one leg, he says. But, Lord, if there's a piece of him left we'll praise God
                  an' be thankful for what we've got." </p>
               <p>"Maw, how did he look? I mos' forgot&mdash;'s been so long sence I seed him?"
                  asked the child. </p>
               <p>"Look! Honey! He was the handsomest man in Campbell county! He had a tall fine
                  figure, brown curly beard, and the sweetest mouth that was always smilin' at me,
                  an' his eyes twinklin' over somethin' funny he'd seed or thought about. When he
                  was young ev'ry gal around here was crazy about him. I got him all right, an' he
                  got me too. Oh me! I can't help but cry, to think he's been gone so long. But he's
                  comin' to-day! I jes feel it in my bones." <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0049" n="20"
                  />
               </p>
               <p>"Look a yonder, Maw, what a skeer-crow ridin' er ole hoss!" cried the girl,
                  looking suddenly toward the road. </p>
               <p>"Glory to God! It's Tom!" she shouted, snatching her old faded sun-bonnet off her
                  head and fairly flying across the field to the gate, her cheeks aflame, her blond
                  hair tumbling over her shoulders, her eyes wet with tears. </p>
               <p>Tom was entering the gate of his modest home in as fine style as possible, seated
                  proudly on a stack of bones that had once been a horse, an old piece of wool on
                  his head that once had been a hat, and a wooden peg fitted into a stump where once
                  was a leg. His face was pale and stained with the red dust of the hill roads, and
                  his beard, now iron grey, and his ragged buttonless uniform were covered with
                  dirt. He was truly a sight to scare crows, if not of interest to buzzards. But to
                  the woman whose swift feet were hurrying to his side, and whose lips were
                  muttering half articulate cries of love, he was the knightliest figure that ever
                  rode in the lists before the assembled beauty of the world. </p>
               <p>"Oh! Tom, Tom, Tom, my ole man! You've come at last!" she sobbed as she threw her
                  arms around his neck, drew him from the horse and fairly smothered him with
                  kisses. </p>
               <p>"Look out, ole woman, you'll break my new leg! cried Tom when he could get breath. </p>
               <p>"I don't care,&mdash;I'll get you another one," she laughed through her tears. </p>
               <p>"Look out there again you're smashing my game shoulder. Got er Minie hall in that
                  one." </p>
               <p>"Well your mouth's all right I see," cried the delighted woman, as she kissed and
                  kissed him. </p>
               <p>"Say, Annie, don't be so greedy, give me a chance at my young one." Tom's eyes
                  were devouring the excited girl who had drawn nearer. </p>
               <p>"Come and kiss your Pappy and tell him how glad <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0050"
                     n="21"/> you are to see him!" said Tom, gathering her in his arms and
                  attempting to carry her to the house. </p>
               <p>He stumbled and fell. In a moment the strong arms of his wife were about him and
                  she was helping him into the house. </p>
               <p>She laid him tenderly on the bed, petted him and cried over him. "My poor old man,
                  he's all shot and cut to pieces. You're so weak, Tom&mdash;I can't believe it.
                  You were so strong. But we'll take care of you. Don't you worry. You just sleep a
                  week and then rest all summer and watch us work the garden for you!" </p>
               <p>He lay still for a few moments with a smile playing around his lips. </p>
               <p>"Lord, ole woman, you don't know how nice it is to be petted like that, to hear a
                  woman's voice, feel her breath on your face and the touch of her hand, warm and
                  soft, after four years sleeping on dirt and living with men and mules, and
                  fightin' and runnin' and diggin' trenches like rats and moles, killin' men,
                  buryin' the dead like carrion, holdin' men while doctors sawed their legs off,
                  till your turn came to be held and sawed! You can't believe it, but this is the
                  first feather bed I've touched in four years. </p>
               <p>"Well, well!&mdash;Bless God it's over now," she cried. "S'long as I've got
                  two strong arms to slave for you&mdash;as long as there's a piece of you left
                  big enough to hold on to&mdash;I'll work for you," and again she bent low over
                  his pale face, and crooned over him as she had so often done over his baby in
                  those four lonely years of war and poverty. </p>
               <p>Suddenly Tom pushed her aside and sprang up in bed. </p>
               <p>"Geemimy, Annie, I forgot my pardners&mdash;there's two more peg-legs out at
                  the gate by this time waiting for us to get through huggin' and carryin' on before
                  they come in. Run, fetch 'em in quick!" <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0051" n="22"/>
               </p>
               <p>Tom struggled to his feet and met them at the door. </p>
               <p>"Come right into my palace, boys, I've seen some fine places in my time, but this
                  is the handsomest one I ever set eyes on. Now, Annie, put the big pot in the
                  little one and don't stand back for expenses. Let's have a dinner these fellers
                  'll never forget." </p>
               <p>It was a feast they never forgot. Tom's wife had raised a brood of early chickens,
                  and managed to keep them from being stolen. She killed four of them and cooked
                  them as only a Southern woman knows how. She had sweet potatoes carefully saved in
                  the mound against the kitchen chimney. There were turnips and greens and radishes,
                  young onions and lettuce and hot corn dodgers fit for a king; and in the centre of
                  the table she deftly fixed a pot of wild flowers little Annie had gathered. She
                  did not tell them that it was the last peck of potatoes and the last pound of
                  meal. This belonged to the morrow. To-day they would live. </p>
               <p>They laughed and joked over this splendid banquet, and told stories of days and
                  nights of hunger and exhaustion, when they had filled their empty stomachs with
                  dreams of home. </p>
               <p>"Miss Camp, you've got the best husband in seven states, did you know that? "asked
                  one of the soldiers, a mere boy. </p>
               <p>"Of course she'll agree to that, sonny," laughed Tom. </p>
               <p>"Well it's so. If it hadn't been for him, M'am, we'd a been peggin' along
                  somewhere way up in Virginny 'stead o' bein' so close to home. You see he let us
                  ride his hoss a mile and then he'd ride a mile. We took it turn about, and here we
                  are." </p>
               <p>"Tom, how in this world did you get that horse?" asked his wife. </p>
               <p>"Honey, I got him on my good looks," said he with a wink. "You see I was a settin'
                  out there in the sun the <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0052" n="23"/> day o' the
                  surrender. I was sorter cryin' and wonderin' how I'd get home with that stump of
                  wood instead of a foot, when along come a chunky heavy set Yankee General, looking
                  as glum as though his folks had surrendered instead of Marse Robert. He saw me,
                  stopped, looked at me a minute right hard and says, "Where do you live?" </p>
               <p>"Way down in ole No'th Caliny," I says, "at Hambright, not far from King's
                  Mountain." </p>
               <p>"How are you going to get home?" says he. </p>
               <p>"God knows, I don't, General. I got a wife and baby down there I ain't seed fer
                  nigh four years, and I want to see 'em so bad I can taste 'em. I was lookin' the
                  other way when I said that, fer I was purty well played out, and feelin' weak and
                  watery about the eyes, an' I didn't want no Yankee General to see water in my
                  eyes." </p>
               <p>"He called a feller to him and sorter snapped out to him, "Go bring the best horse
                  you can spare for this man and give it to him." </p>
               <p>"Then he turns to me and seed I was all choked up and couldn't say nothin' and
                  says: </p>
               <p>"I'm General Grant. Give my love to your folks when you get home. I've known what
                  it was to be a poor white man down South myself once for awhile." </p>
               <p>"God bless you, General. I thanks you from the bottom of my heart," I says as
                  quick as I could find my tongue, "if it had to be surrender I'm glad it was to
                  such a man as you. </p>
               <p>"He never said another word, but just walked slow along smoking a big cigar. So
                  ole woman, you know the reason I named that hoss, 'General Grant.' It may be I
                  have seen finer hosses than that one, but I couldn't recollect anything about 'em
                  on the road home." </p>
               <p>Dinner over, Tom's comrades rose and looked wistfully down the dusty road leading
                  southward. </p>
               <p>"Well, Tom, ole man, we gotter be er movin'," said the <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0053" n="24"/> older of the two soldiers. "We're
                  powerful obleeged to you fur helpin' us along this fur." </p>
               <p>"All right, boys, you'll find yer train standin' on the side o' the track eatin'
                  grass. Jes climb up, pull the lever and let her go." </p>
               <p>The men's faces brightened, their lips twitched. They looked at Tom, and then at
                  the old horse. They looked down the long dusty road stretching over hill and
                  valley, hundreds of miles south, and then at Tom's wife and child, whispered to
                  one another a moment, and the elder said: </p>
               <p>"No, pardner, you've been awful good to us, but we'll get along
                  somehow&mdash;we can't take yer hoss. It's all yer got now ter make a livin'
                  on yer place." </p>
               <p>"All I got?" shouted Tom, "man alive, ain't you seed my ole woman, as fat and
                  jolly and han'some as when I married her 'leven years ago? Didn't you hear her
                  cryin' an' shoutin' like she's crazy when I got home? Didn't you see my little gal
                  with eyes jes like her daddy's? Don't you see my cabin standin' as purty as a ripe
                  peach in the middle of the orchard when hundreds of fine houses are lyin' in
                  ashes? Ain't I got ten acres of land? Ain't I got God Almighty above me and all
                  around me, the same God that watched over me on the battlefields? All I got? That
                  old stack o' bones that looks like er hoss? Well I reckon not!" </p>
               <p>"Pardner, it ain't right," grumbled the soldier, with more of cheerful thanks than
                  protest in his voice. </p>
               <p>"Oh! Get off you fools," said Tom good-naturedly, "ain't it my hoss? Can't I do
                  what I please with him?" </p>
               <p>So with hearty hand-shakes they parted, the two astride the old horse's back. One
                  had lost his right leg, the other, his left, and this gave them a good leg on each
                  side to hold the cargo straight. <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0054" n="25"/>
               </p>
               <p>"Take keer yerself, Tom!" they both cried in the same breath as they moved away. </p>
               <p>"Take keer yerselves, boys. I'm all right!" answered Tom, as he stumped his way
                  back to the home. "It's all right, it's all right," he muttered to himself. "He'd
                  a come in handy, but I'd a never slept thinkin' o' them peggin' along them rough
                  roads." </p>
               <p>Before reaching the house he sat down on a wooden bench beneath a tree to rest. It
                  was the first week in May and the leaves were not yet grown. The sun was pouring
                  his hot rays down into the moist earth, and the heat began to feel like summer. As
                  he drank in the beauty and glory of the spring his soul was melted with joy. The
                  fruit trees were laden with the promise of the treasures of the summer and autumn,
                  a cat-bird was singing softly to his mate in the tree over his head, and a
                  mockingbird seated in the topmost branch of an elm near his cabin home was leading
                  the oratorio of feathered songsters. The wild plum and blackberry briars were in
                  full bloom in the fence corners, and the sweet odour filled the air. He heard his
                  wife singing in the house. </p>
               <p>"It's a fine old world after all!" he exclaimed leaning back and half closing his
                  eyes, while a sense of ineffable peace filled his soul. "Peace at last! Thank God!
                  May I never see a gun or a sword, or hear a drum or a fife's scream on this earth
                  again!" </p>
               <p>A hound came close wagging his tail and whining for a word of love and
                  recognition. </p>
               <p>"Well, Bob, old boy, you're the only one left. You'll have to chase cotton-tails
                  by yourself now." </p>
               <p>Bob's eyes watered and he licked his master's hand apparently understanding every
                  word he said. </p>
               <p>Breaking from his master's hands the dog ran toward the gate barking, and Tom rose
                  in haste as he recognised <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0055" n="26"/> the sturdy
                  tread of the Preacher, Rev. John Durham, walking rapidly toward the house. </p>
               <p>Grasping him heartily by the hand the Preacher said, </p>
               <p>"Tom, you don't know how it warms my soul to look into your face again. When you
                  left, I felt like a man who had lost one hand. I've found it to-day. You're the
                  same stalwart Christian full of joy and love. Some men's religion didn't stand the
                  wear and tear of war. You've come out with your soul like gold tried in the fire.
                  Colonel Gaston wrote me you were the finest soldier in the regiment, and that you
                  were the only Chaplain he had seen that he could consult for his own soul's cheer.
                  That's the kind of a deacon to send to the front! I'm proud of you, and you're
                  still at your old tricks. I met two one-legged soldiers down the road riding your
                  horse away as though you had a stable full at your command. You needn't apologise
                  or explain, they told me all about it." </p>
               <p>"Preacher, it's good to have the Lord's messenger speak words like them. I can't
                  tell you how glad I am to be home again and shake your hand. I tell you it was a
                  comfort to me when I lay awake at night an them battlefields, a wonderin' what had
                  become of my ole woman and the baby, to recollect that you were here, and how
                  often I'd heard you tell us how the Lord tempered the wind to the shorn lamb.
                  Annie's been telling me who watched out for her them dark days when there was
                  nothin' to eat. I reckon you and your wife knows the way to this house about as
                  well as you do to the church." </p>
               <p>Tom had pulled the Preacher down on the seat beside him while he said this. </p>
               <p>"The dark days have only begun, Tom. I've come to see you to have you cheer me up.
                  Somehow you always seemed to me to be closer to God than any man in the church.
                  You will need all your faith now. It seems <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0056" n="27"
                  /> to me that every second woman I know is a widow. Hundreds of families have no
                  seed even to plant, no horse to work crops, no men who will work if they had
                  horses. What are we to do? I see hungry children in every house." </p>
               <p>"Preacher, the Lord is looking down here to-day and sees all this as plain as you
                  and me. As long as He is in the sky everything will come all right on the earth." </p>
               <p>"How's your pantry?" asked the Preacher. </p>
               <p>"Don't know. 'Man shall not live by bread alone,' you know. When I hear these
                  birds in the trees an' see this old dog waggin' his tail at me, and smell the
                  breath of them flowers, and it all comes over me that I'm done killin' men, and
                  I'm at home, with a bed to sleep on, a roof over my head, a woman to pet me and
                  tell me I'm great and handsome, I don't feel like I'll ever need anything more to
                  eat! I believe I could live a whole mouth here without eatin' a bite." </p>
               <p>"Good. You come to the prayer meeting to-night and say a few things like that, and
                  the folks will believe they have been eating three square meals every day." </p>
               <p>"I'll be there. I ain't asked Annie what she's got, but I know she's got greens
                  and turnips, onions and collards, and strawberries in the garden. Irish taters 'll
                  be big enough to eat in three weeks, and sweets comin' right on. We've got a few
                  chickens. The blackberries and plums and peaches and apples are all on the road.
                  Ah! Preacher, it's my soul that's been starved away from my wife and child!" </p>
               <p>"You don't know how much I need help sometimes Tom. I am always giving, giving
                  myself in sympathy and help to others, I'm famished now and then. I feel faint and
                  worn out. You seem to fill me again with life." </p>
               <p>"I'm glad to hear you say that, Preacher. I get down-hearted <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0057" n="28"/> sometimes, when I recollect I'm nothin'
                  but a poor white man. I'll remember your words. I'm goin' to do my part in the
                  church work. You know where to find me." </p>
               <p>"Well, that's partly what brought me here this morning. I want you to help me look
                  after Mrs. Gaston and her little boy. She is prostrated over the death of the
                  Colonel and is hanging between life and death. She is in a delirious condition all
                  the time and must be watched day and night. I want you to watch the first half of
                  the night with Nelse, and Eve and Mary will watch the last half." </p>
               <p>"Of course, I'll do anything in the world I can for my Colonel's widder. He was
                  the bravest man that ever led a regiment, and he was a father to us boys. I'll be
                  there. But I won't set up with that nigger. He can go to bed." </p>
               <p>"Tom, it's a funny thing to me that as good a Christian as you are should hate a
                  nigger so. He's a human being. It's not right." </p>
               <p>"He may be human, Preacher, I don't know. To tell you the truth, I have my doubts.
                  Anyhow, I can't help it. God knows I hate the sight of 'em like I do a
                  rattlesnake. That nigger Nelse, they say is a good one. He was faithful to the
                  Colonel, I know, but I couldn't bear him no more than any of the rest of 'em. I
                  always hated a nigger since I was knee high. My daddy and my mammy hated 'em
                  before me. Somehow, we always felt like they was crowdin' us to death on them big
                  plantations, and the little ones too. And then I had to leave my wife and baby and
                  fight four years, all on account of their stinkin' hides, that never done nothin'
                  for me except make it harder to live. Every time I'd go into battle and hear them
                  Minie balls begin to sing over us, it seemed to me I could see their black ape
                  faces grinnin' <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0058" n="29"/> and makin' fun of poor
                  whites. At night when they'd detail me to help the ambulance corps carry off the
                  dead and the wounded, there was a strange smell on the field ' that came from the
                  blood and night damp and burnt powder. It always smelled like a nigger to me! It
                  made me sick. Yes, Preacher, God forgive me, I hate 'em! I can't help it any more
                  than I can the color of my skin or my hair." </p>
               <p>"I'll fix it with Nelse, then. You take the first part of the night 'till twelve
                  clock. I'll go down with you from the church to-night," said the Preacber, as he
                  shook Tom's hand and took his leave. </p>

               <head> CHAPTER VI<lb/> THE PREACHER AND THE WOMAN OF BOSTON </head>

               <p>The next day the Preacher had a call from Miss Susan Walker of Boston, whose
                  liberality had built the new Negro school house and whose life and fortune was
                  devoted to the education and elevation of the Negro race. She had been in the
                  village often within the year, running up from Independence where she was building
                  and endowing a magnificent classical college for negroes. He had often heard of
                  her, but as she stopped with negroes when on her visits he had never met her. He
                  was especially interested in her after hearing incidentally that she was a member
                  of a Baptist church in Boston. </p>
               <p>On entering the parlour the Preacher greeted his visitor with the deference the
                  typical Southern man instinctively pays to woman. </p>
               <p>"I am pleased to meet you, Madam," he said with a graceful bow and kindly smile,
                  as he led her to the most comfortable seat he could find. </p>
               <p>She looked him squarely in the face for a moment as though surprised and smilingly
                  replied, </p>
               <p>"I believe you Southern men are all alike, woman flatterers. You have a way of
                  making every woman believe you think her a queen. It pleases me, I can't help
                  confessing it, though I sometimes despise myself for it. But I am not going to
                  give you an opportunity to feed my vanity this morning. I've come for a plain face
                  to <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0074" n="45"/> face talk with you on the one subject
                  that fills my heart, my work among the Freedmen. You are a Baptist minister. I
                  have a right to your friendship and co-operation." </p>
               <p>A cloud overshadowed the Preacher's face as he seated himself. He said nothing for
                  a moment, looking curiously and thoughtfully at his visitor. </p>
               <p>He seemed to be studying her character and to be puzzled by the problem. She was a
                  woman of prepossessing appearance, well past thirty-five, with streaks of grey
                  appearing in her smoothly brushed black hair. She was dressed plainly in rich
                  brown material cut in tailor fashion, and her heavy hair was drawn straight up
                  pompadour style from her forehead with apparent carelessness and yet in a way that
                  heightened the impression of strength and beauty in her face. Her nose was the one
                  feature that gave warning of trouble in an encounter. She was plump in figure,
                  almost stout, and her nose seemed too small for the breadth of her face. It was
                  broad enough, but too short, and was pug tipped slightly at the end. She fell just
                  a little short of being handsome and this nose was responsible for the failure. It
                  gave to her face when agitated, in spite of evident culture and refinement, the
                  expression of a feminine bull dog. </p>
               <p>Her eyes were flashing now, and her nostrils opened a little wider and began to
                  push the tip of her nose upward. At last she snapped out suddenly, </p>
               <p>"Well which is it, friend or foe? What do you honestly think of my work?" </p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Miss Walker, I am not accustomed to speak rudely to a lady. If I am
                  honest, I don't know where to begin." </p>
               <p>"Bah! Lay aside your Don Quixote Southern chivalry this morning and talk to me in
                  plain English. It doesn't matter whether I am a woman or a man. I am an idea, <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0075" n="46"/> a divine mission this morning. I mean to
                  establish a high school in this village for the negroes, and to build a Baptist
                  church for them. I learn from them that they have great faith in you. Many of them
                  desire your approval and co-operation. Will you help me?" </p>
               <p>"To be perfectly frank, I will not. You ask me for plain English. I will give it
                  to you. Your presence in this village as a missionary to the heathen is an insult
                  to our intelligence and Christian manhood. You come at this late day a missionary
                  among the heathen, the heathen whose heart and brain created this Republic with
                  civil and religious liberty for its foundations, a missionary among the heathen
                  who gave the world Washington, whose giant personality three times saved the cause
                  of American Liberty from ruin when his army had melted away. You are a missionary
                  among the children of Washington, Jefferson, Monroe, Madison, Jackson, Clay and
                  Calhoun! Madam, I have baptised into the fellowship of the church of Christ in
                  this county more negroes than you ever saw in all your life before you left
                  Boston. </p>
               <p>"At the close of the war there were thousands of negro members of white Baptist
                  churches in the state. Your mission is not to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ.
                  Your mission is to teach crack-brained theories of social and political equality
                  to four millions of ignorant negroes, some of whom are but fifty years removed
                  from the savagery of African jungles. Your work is to separate and alienate the
                  negroes from their former masters who can be their only real friends and
                  guardians. Your work is to sow the dragon's teeth of an impossible social order
                  that will bring forth its harvest of blood for our children." </p>
               <p>He paused a moment, and, suddenly facing her continued, "I should like to help the
                  cause you have at heart and the most effective service I could render it now would
                     <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0076" n="47"/> be to box you up in a glass cage,
                  such as are used for rattlesnakes, and ship you back to Boston." </p>
               <p>"Indeed! I suppose then it is still a crime in the South to teach the Negro?" she
                  asked this in little gasps of fury, her eyes flashing defiance and her two rows of
                  white teeth uncovering by the rising of her pugnacious nose. </p>
               <p>"For you, yes. It is always a crime to teach a lie." </p>
               <p>"Thank you. Your frankness is all one could wish!" </p>
               <p>"Pardon my apparent rudeness. You not only invited, you demanded it. While about
                  it, let me make a clean breast of it. I do you personally the honour to
                  acknowledge that you are honest and in dead earnest, and that you mean well. You
                  are simply a fanatic." </p>
               <p>"Allow me again to thank you for your candour!" </p>
               <p>"Don't mention it, Madam. You will be canonised in due time. In the meantime let
                  us understand one another. Our lives are now very far apart, though we read the
                  same Bible, worship the same God and hold the same great faith. In the settlement
                  of this Negro question you as an insolent interloper. You're worse, you are a
                  wilful spoiled child of rich and powerful parents playing with matches in a powder
                  mill. I not only will not help you, I would, If I had the power seize you, and
                  return you to a place of safety. But I cannot oppose you. You are protected in
                  your play by a million bayonets and back of these bayonets are banked the fires of
                  passion in the North ready to burst into flame in a moment. The only thing I can
                  do is to ignore your existence. You understand my position." </p>
               <p>"Certainly, Doctor," she replied good naturedly. </p>
               <p>She had recovered from the rush of her anger now and was herself again. A curious
                  smile played round her lips as she quietly added: </p>
               <p>"I must really thank you for your candour. You have <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0077" n="48"/> helped me immensely. I understand the
                  situation now perfectly. I shall go forward cheerfully in my work and never bother
                  my brain again about you, or your people, or your point of view. You have aroused
                  all the fighting blood in me. I feel toned up and ready for a life struggle. I
                  assure you I shall cherish no ill feeling toward you. I am only sorry to see a man
                  of your powers so blinded by prejudice. I will simply ignore you." </p>
               <p>"Then, Madam, it is quite clear we agree upon establishing and maintaining a great
                  mutual ignorance. Let us hope, paradoxical as it may seem, that it may be for the
                  enlightenment of future generations!" </p>
               <p>She arose to go, smiling at his last speech. </p>
               <p>"Before we part, perhaps never to meet again, let me ask you one question," said
                  the Preacher still looking thoughtfully at her. </p>
               <p>"Certainly, as many as you like." </p>
               <p>"Why is it that you good people of the North are spending your millions here now
                  to help only the negroes who feel least of all the sufferings of this war? The
                  poor white people of the South are your own flesh and blood. These Scotch
                  Covenanters, are of the same Puritan stock, these German, Huguenot and English
                  people are all your kinsmen, who stood at the stake with your fathers in the old
                  world. They are, many of them, homeless, without clothes, sick and hungry and
                  broken hearted. But one in ten of them ever owned a slave. They had to fight this
                  war because your armies invaded their soil. But for their sorrows, sufferings and
                  burdens you have no ear to hear and no heart to pity. This is a strange thing to
                  me." </p>
               <p>"The white people of the South can take care of themselves. If they suffer, it is
                  God's just punishment for their sins in owning slaves and fighting against the
                  flag. Do I make myself clear?" she snapped. <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0078"
                     n="49"/>
               </p>
               <p>"Perfectly, I haven't another word to say." </p>
               <p>"My heart yearns for the poor dear black people who have suffered so many years in
                  slavery and have been denied the rights of human beings. I am not only going to
                  establish schools and colleges for them here, but I am conducting an experiment of
                  thrilling interest to me which will prove that their intellectual, moral, and
                  social capacity is equal to any white man's." </p>
               <p>"Is it so? "asked the Preacher. </p>
               <p>"Yes, I am collecting from every section of the South the most promising specimens
                  of negro boys and sending them to our great Northern Universities where they will
                  be educated among men who treat them as equals, and I expect from the boys reared
                  in this atmosphere, men of transcendent genius, whose brilliant achievements in
                  science, art and letters will forever silence the tongues of slander against their
                  race. The most interesting of these students I have at Harvard now is young George
                  Harris. His mother is Eliza Harris, the history of whose escape over the ice of
                  the Ohio River fleeing from slavery thrilled the world. This boy is a genius, and
                  if he lives he will shake this nation." </p>
               <p>"It may be, Miss Walker. There are more ways than one to shake a nation. And while
                  I ignore your work, as a citizen and public man,&mdash;privately and
                  personally, I shall watch this experiment with profound interest." </p>
               <p>"I know it will succeed. I believe God made us of one blood," she said with
                  enthusiasm. </p>
               <p>"Is it true, Madam, that you once endowed a home for homeless cats before you
                  became interested in the black people?" With a twinkle in his eye the Preacher
                  softly asked this apparently irrelevant question. </p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, I did,&mdash;I am proud of it. I love cats. There an over a
                  thousand in the home now, and they are well cared for. Whose business is it?" <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0079" n="50"/>
               </p>
               <p>"I meant no offense by the question. I love cats too. But I wondered if you were
                  collecting negroes only now, or, whether you were adding other specimens to your
                  menagerie for experimental purposes." </p>
               <p>She bit her lips, and in spite of her efforts to restrain her anger, tears sprang
                  to her eyes as she turned toward the Preacher whose face now looked calmly down
                  upon her with ill-concealed pride. </p>
               <p>"Oh! the insolence of you Southern people toward those who dare to differ with you
                  about the Negro!" she cried with rage. </p>
               <p>"I confess it humbly as a Christian, it is true. My scorn for these maudlin ideas
                  is so deep that words have no power to convey it. But come," said the Preacher in
                  the kindliest tone. "Enough of this. I am pained to see tears in your eyes. Pardon
                  my thoughtlessness. Let us forget now for a little while that you are an idea, and
                  remember only that you are a charming Boston woman of the household of our own
                  faith. Let me call Mrs. Durham, and have you know her and discuss with her the
                  thousand and one things dear to all women's hearts." </p>
               <p>"No, I thank you! I feel a little sore and bruised, and social amenities can have
                  no meaning for those whose souls are on fire with such antagonistic ideas as yours
                  and mine. If Mrs. Durham can give me any sympathy in my work Ill be delighted to
                  see her, otherwise I must go." </p>
               <p>The Preacher laughed aloud. </p>
               <p>"Then let me beg of you, never meet Mrs. Durham. If you do, the war will break out
                  again. I don't wish to figure in a case of assault and battery. Mrs. Durham was
                  the owner of fifty slaves. She represents the bluest of the blue blood of the
                  slave-holding aristocracy of the South. She has never surrendered and she never
                  will. Wars, surrenders, constitutional amendments and such <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0080" n="51"/> little things make no impression on her
                  mind whatever. If you think I am difficult, you had better not puzzle your brain
                  over her. I am a mildly constructive man of progress. She is a Conservative." </p>
               <p>"Then we will say good-bye," said Miss Walker, extending her small plump hand in
                  friendly parting. "I accept your challenge which this interview implies. I will
                  succeed if God lives," and she set her lips with a snap that spoke volumes. </p>
               <p>"And I will watch you from afar with sorrow and fear and trembling," responded the
                  Preacher. </p>

               <head> CHAPTER XI<lb/> SIMON LEGREE </head>

               <p>In the death of Mr. Lincoln, a group of radical politicians, hitherto suppressed,
                  saw their supreme opportunity to obtain control of the nation in the crisis of an
                  approaching Presidential campaign. </p>
               <p>Now they could fasten their schemes of proscription, confiscation, and revenge
                  upon the South. </p>
               <p>Mr. Lincoln had held these wolves at bay during his life by the power of his great
                  personality. But the Lion was dead, and the Wolf, who had snarled and snapped at
                  him in life, put on his skin and claimed the heritage of his power. The Wolf
                  whispered his message of hate, and in the hour of partisan passion became the
                  master of the nation. </p>
               <p>Busy feet had been hurrying back and forth from the Southern states to Washington
                  whispering in the Wolf's ear the stories of sure success, if only the plan of
                  proscription, disfranchisement of whites, and enfranchisement of blacks were
                  carried out. </p>
               <p>This movement was inaugurated two years after the war, with every Southern state
                  in profound peace, and in a life and death struggle with nature, to prevent
                  famine. The new revolution destroyed the Union a second time, paralysed every
                  industry in the South, and transformed ten peaceful states into roaring hells of
                  anarchy. We have easily outlived the sorrows of the war. That was a surgery which
                  healed the body. But the <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0115" n="84"/> child has not
                  yet been born whose children's children will live to see the healing of the wounds
                  from those four years of chaos, when fanatics blinded by passion, armed millions
                  of ignorant negroes and thrust them into mortal combat with the proud, bleeding,
                  half-starving Anglo-Saxon race of the South. Such a deed once done, can never be
                  undone. It fixes the status of these races for a thousand years, if not for
                  eternity. </p>
               <p>The South was now rapidly gathering into two hostile armies under these
                  influences, with race marks as uniforms&mdash;the Black against the White. </p>
               <p>The Negro army was under the command of a triumvirate, the Carpet-bagger from the
                  North, the native Scalawag and the Negro Demagogue. </p>
               <p>Entirely distinct from either of these was the genuine Yankee soldier settler in
                  the South after the war, who came because he loved its genial skies and kindly
                  people. </p>
               <p>Ultimately some of these Northern settlers were forced into politics by conditions
                  around them, and they constituted the only conscience and brains visible in public
                  life during the reign of terror which the "Reconstruction" r&eacute;gime
                  inaugurated. </p>
               <p>In the winter of 1866 the Union League at Hambright held a meeting of special
                  importance. The attendance was large and enthusiastic. </p>
               <p>Amos Hogg, the defeated candidate for Governor in the last election, now the
                  President of the Federation of "Loyal Leagues," had sent a special ambassador to
                  this meeting to receive reports and give instructions. </p>
               <p>This ambassador was none other than the famous Simon Legree of Red River, who had
                  migrated to North Carolina attracted by the first proclamation of the President,
                  announcing his plan for readmitting the state to the Union. The rumours of his
                  death proved a mistake. He had quit drink, and set his mind on greater vices. <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0116" n="85"/>
               </p>
               <p>In his face were the features of the distinguished ruffian whose cruelty to his
                  slaves had made him unique in infamy in the annals of the South. He was now
                  pre-eminently the type of the "truly loyal". At the first rumour of war he had
                  sold his negroes and migrated nearer the border land, that he might the better
                  avoid service in either army. He succeeded in doing this. The last two years of
                  the war, however, the enlisting officers pressed him hard, until finally he hit on
                  a brilliant scheme. </p>
               <p>He shaved clean, and dressed as a German emigrant woman. He wore dresses for two
                  years, did house work, milked the cows and cut wood for a good natured old German.
                  He paid for his board, and passed for a sister, just from the old country. </p>
               <p>When the war closed, he resumed male attire, became a violent Union man, and swore
                  that he had been hounded and persecuted without mercy by the Secessionist rebels. </p>
               <p>He was looking more at ease now than ever in his life. He wore a silk hat and a
                  new suit of clothes made by a fashionable tailor in Raleigh. He was a little older
                  looking than when he killed Uncle Tom on his farm some ten years before, but
                  otherwise unchanged. He had the same short muscular body, round bullet head, light
                  grey eyes and shaggy eyebrows, but his deep chestnut bristly hair had been trimmed
                  by a barber. His coarse thick lips drooped at the corners of his mouth and
                  emphasised the crook in his nose. His eyes, well set apart, as of old, were bold,
                  commanding, and flashed with the cold light of glittering steel. His teeth that
                  once were pointed like the fangs of a wolf had been filed by a dentist. But it
                  required more than the file of a dentist to smooth out of that face the ferocity
                  and cruelty that years of dissolute habits had fixed. </p>
               <p>He was only forty-two years old, but the flabby flesh <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0117" n="86"/> under his eyes and his enormous
                  square-cut jaw made him look fully fifty. </p>
               <p>It was a spectacle for gods and men, to see him harangue that Union League in the
                  platitudes of loyalty to the Union, and to watch the crowd of negroes hang
                  breathless on his every word as the inspired Gospel of God. The only notable
                  change in him from the old days was in his speech. He had hired a man to teach him
                  grammar and pronunciation. He had high ambitions for the future. </p>
               <p>"Be of good cheer, beloved!" he said to the negroes. "A great day is coming for
                  you. You are to rule this land. Your old masters are to dig in the fields and you
                  are to sit under the shade and be gentlemen. Old Andy Johnson will be kicked out
                  of the White House or hung, and the farms you've worked on so long will be divided
                  among you. You can rent them to your old masters and live in ease the balance of
                  your life." </p>
               <p>"Glory to God!" shouted an old negro. </p>
               <p>"I have just been to Washington for our great leader, Amos Hogg. I've seen Mr.
                  Sumner, Mr. Stevens and Mr. Butler. I have shown them that we can carry any state
                  in the South, if they will only give you the ballot and take it away from enough
                  rebels. We have promised them the votes in the Presidential election, and they are
                  going to give us what we want." </p>
               <p>"Hallelujah! Amen! Yas Lawd!" The fervent exclamations came from every part of the
                  room. </p>
               <p>After the meeting the negroes pressed around Legree and shook his hand with
                  eagerness&mdash;the same hand that was red with the blood of their race. </p>
               <p>When the crowd had dispersed a meeting of the leaders was held. </p>
               <p>Dave Haley, the ex-slave trader from Kentucky who bad dodged back and forth from
                  the mountains of his <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0118" n="87"/> native state to the
                  mountains of Western North Carolina and kept out of the armies, was there. He had
                  settled in Hambright and hoped at least to get the post-office under the new
                  dispensation. </p>
               <p>In the group was the full blooded negro, Tim Shelby. He had belonged to the
                  Shelbys of Kentucky, but had escaped through Ohio into Canada before the war. He
                  had returned home with great expectations of revolutions to follow in the wake of
                  the victorious armies of the North. He had been disappointed in the programme of
                  kindliness and mercy that immediately followed the fall of the Confederacy; but he
                  had been busy day and night since the war in organising the negroes, in secretly
                  furnishing them arms and wherever possible he had them grouped in military posts
                  and regularly drilled. He was elated at the brilliant prospects which Legree's
                  report from Washington opened. </p>
               <p>"Glorious news you bring us, brother!" he exclaimed as he slapped Legree on the
                  back. </p>
               <p>"Yes, and it's straight." </p>
               <p>"Did Mr. Stevens tell you so? </p>
               <p>"He's the man that told me." </p>
               <p>"Well, you can tie to him. He's the master now that rules the country," said Tim
                  with enthusiasm. </p>
               <p>"You bet he's runnin' it. He showed me his bill to confiscate the property of the
                  rebels and give it to the truly loyal and the niggers. It's a hummer. You ought to
                  have seen the old man's eyes flash fire when he pulled that bill out of his desk
                  and read it to me." </p>
               <p>"When will he pass it?" </p>
               <p>"Two years, yet. He told me the fools up North were not quite ready for it; and
                  that he had two other bills first, that would run the South crazy and so fire the
                  North that he could pass anything he wanted and hang old Andy Johnson besides."
                     <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0119" n="88"/>
               </p>
               <p>"Praise God," shouted Tim, as he threw his arms around Legree and hugged him. </p>
               <p>Tim kept his kinky hair cut close, and when excited he had a way of wrinkling his
                  scalp so as to lift his ears up and down like a mule. His lips were big and thick,
                  and he combed assiduously a tiny mustache which he tried in vain to pull out in
                  straight Napoleonic style. </p>
               <p>He worked his scalp and ears vigourously as he exclaimed, "Tell us the whole plan,
                  brother!" </p>
               <p>"The plan's simple," said Legree. "Mr. Stevens is going to give the nigger the
                  ballot, and take it from enough white men to give the niggers a majority. Then he
                  will kick old Andy Johnson out of the White House, put the gag on the Supreme
                  Court so the South can't appeal, pan his bill to confiscate the property of the
                  rebels and give it to loyal men and the niggers, and run the rebels out." </p>
               <p>"And the beauty of the plan is," said Tim with unction, "that they are going to
                  allow the Negro to vote to give himself the ballot and not allow the white man to
                  vote against it. That's what I call a dead sure thing." Tim drew himself up, a
                  sardonic grin revealing his white teeth from ear to ear, and burst into an
                  impassioned harangue to the excited group. He was endowed with native eloquence,
                  and had graduated from a college in Canada under the private tutorship of its
                  professors. He was well versed in English History. He could hold an audience of
                  negroes spell bound, and his audacity commanded the attention of the boldest white
                  man who heard him. </p>
               <p>Legree, Perkins and Haley cheered his wild utterances and urged him to greater
                  flights. </p>
               <p>He paused as though about to stop when Legree, evidently surprised and delighted
                  at his powers said, "Go on! Go on!" <pb/>
                  <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0122" n="89"/>
               </p>
               <p>"Yes, go on," shouted Perkins. "We are done with race and colour lines." </p>
               <p>A dreamy look came to Tim's eyes as he continued, </p>
               <p>"Our proud white aristocrats of the South are in a panic it seems. They fear the
                  coming power of the Negro. They fear their Desdemonas may be fascinated again by
                  an Othello! Well, Othello's day has come at last. If he has dreamed dreams in the
                  past his tongue dared not speak, the day is fast coming when he will put these
                  dreams into deeds, not words. </p>
               <p>"The South has not paid the penalties of her crimes. The work of the conqueror has
                  not yet been done in this land. Our work now is to bring the proud low and exalt
                  the lowly. This is the first duty of the conqueror. </p>
               <p>"The French Revolutionists established a tannery where they tanned the hides of
                  dead aristocrats into leather with which they shod the common people. This was
                  France in the eighteenth century with a thousand years of Christian culture. </p>
               <p>"When the English army conquered Scotland they hunted and killed every fugitive to
                  a man, tore from the homes of their fallen foes their wives, stripped them naked,
                  and made them follow the army begging bread, the laughing stock and sport of every
                  soldier and camp follower! This was England in the meridian of Anglo-Saxon
                  intellectual glory, the England of Shakespeare who was writing Othello to please
                  the warlike populace. </p>
               <p>"I say to my people now in the language of the inspired Word, 'All things are
                  yours!' I have been drilling and teaching them through the Union League, the young
                  and the old. I have told the old men that they will be just as useful as the
                  young. If they can't carry a musket they can apply the torch when the time comes.
                  And they are ready now to answer the call of the Lord!" </p>
               <p>They crowded around Tim and wrung his hand. <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0123"

               <p>* * * * * * </p>
               <p>Early in 1867, two years after the war, Thaddeus Stevens passed through Congress
                  his famous bill destroying the governments of the Southern states, and dividing
                  them into military districts, enfranchising the whole negro race, and
                  disfranchising one-fourth of the whites. The army was sent back to the South to
                  enforce these decrees at the point of the bayonet. The authority of the Supreme
                  Court was destroyed by a supplementary act and the South denied the right of
                  appeal. Mr. Stevens then introduced his bill to confiscate the property of the
                  white people of the 'South. The negroes laid down their hoes and plows and began
                  to gather in excited meetings. Crimes of violence increased daily. Not a night
                  passed but that a burning barn or home wrote its message of anarchy on the black
                  sky. </p>
               <p>The negroes refused to sign any contracts to work, to pay rents, or vacate their
                  houses on notice even from the Freedman's Bureau. </p>
               <p>The negroes on General Worth's Plantation, not only refused to work, or move, but
                  organised to prevent any white man from putting his foot on the land. </p>
               <p>General Worth procured a special order from the headquarters of the Freedman's
                  Bureau for the district located at Independence. When the officer appeared and
                  attempted to serve this notice, the negroes mobbed him. </p>
               <p>A company of troops were ordered to Hambright, and the notice served again by the
                  Bureau official accompanied by the Captain of this company. </p>
               <p>The negroes asked for time to hold a meeting and discuss the question. They held
                  their meeting and gathered fully five hundred men from the neighbourhood, all
                  armed with revolvers or muskets. They asked Legree and Tim Shelby to tell them
                  what they should do. There was no <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0124" n="91"/>
                  uncertain sound in what Legree said. He looked over the crowd of eager faces with
                  pride and conscious power. </p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, your duty is plain. Hold your land. It's yours. You've worked it for a
                  lifetime. These officers here tell you that old Andy Johnson has pardoned General
                  Worth and that you have no rights on the land without his contract. I tell you old
                  Andy Johnson has no right to pardon a rebel, and that he will be hung before
                  another year. Thaddeus Stevens, Charles Sumner and B. F. Butler are running this
                  country. Mr. Stevens has never failed yet on anything he has set his hand. He has
                  promised to give you the land. Stick to it. Shake your fist in old Andy Johnson's
                  face and the face of this Bureau and tell them so." </p>
               <p>"Dat we will!" shouted a negro woman, as Tim Shelby rose to speak. </p>
               <p>"You have suffered," said Tim. "Now let the white man suffer. Times have changed.
                  In the old days the white man said, </p>
               <p>"John, come black my boots!" </p>
               <p>"And the poor negro had to black his boots. I expect to see the day when I will
                  say to a white man, "Black my boots!" And the white man will tip his hat and hurry
                  to do what I tell him." </p>
               <p>"Yes, Lawd! Glory to God! Hear dat now!" </p>
               <p>"We will drive the white men out of this country. That is the purpose of our
                  friends at Washington. If white men want to live in the South they can become our
                  servants. If they don't like their job they can move to a more congenial climate.
                  You have Congress on your side, backed by a million bayonets. There is no
                  President. The Supreme Court is chained. In San Domingo no white man is allowed to
                  vote, hold office, or hold a foot of land. We will make this mighty South a more
                  glorious San Domingo." <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0125" n="92"/>
               </p>
               <p>A frenzied shout rent the air. Tim and Legree were carried on the shoulders of
                  stalwart men in triumphant procession with five hundred crazy negroes yelling and
                  screaming at their heels. </p>
               <p>The officers made their escape in the confusion and beat a hasty retreat to town.
                  They reported the situation to headquarters, and asked for instructions. </p>

               <head> CHAPTER XIII<lb/> DICK </head>

               <p>When Charlie Gaston reached his home after a never-to-be-forgotten day in the
                  woods with the Preacher, he found a ragged little dirt-smeared negro boy peeping
                  through the fence into the woodyard. </p>
               <p>"What you want?" cried Charlie. </p>
               <p>"Nuttin!" </p>
               <p>"What's your name?" </p>
               <p>"Dick." </p>
               <p>"Who's your father?" </p>
               <p>"Haint got none. My mudder say she was tricked, en I'se de trick!" he chuckled and
                  walled his eyes. </p>
               <p>Charlie came close and looked him over. Dick giggled and showed the whites of his
                  eyes. </p>
               <p>"What made that streak on your neck?" </p>
               <p>"Nigger done it wid er axe." </p>
               <p>"What nigger?" </p>
               <p>"Low life nigger name er Amos what stays roun' our house Sundays." </p>
               <p>"What made him do it?" </p>
               <p>"He low he wuz me daddy, en I sez he wuz er liar, en den he grab de axe en try ter
                  chop me head off." </p>
               <p>"Gracious, he 'most killed you!" </p>
               <p>"Yassir, but de doctor sewed me head back, en hit grow'd." </p>

               </p>
               <p>"Say!" grinned Dick. </p>
               <p>"What?" </p>
               <p>"I likes you." </p>
               <p>"Do you?" </p>
               <p>"Yassir, en I aint gwine home no mo'. I done run away, en I wants ter live wid

                  Nelse git holt er me." </p>
               <p>Charlie's heart went out to the ragged little waif. He took him by the hand, led
                  him into the yard, found his mother, and begged her to give him a place to sleep
                  and keep him. </p>
               <p>His mother tried to persuade him to make Dick go back to his own home. Nelse was
                  loud in his objections to the new comer, and Aunt Eve looked at him as though she
                  would throw him over the fence. </p>
               <p>But Dick stuck doggedly to Charlie's heels. </p>
               <p>"Mama dear, see, they tried to cut his head off with an axe," cried the boy, and
                  he wheeled Dick around and showed the terrible scar across the back of his neck. </p>
               <p>"I spec hits er pity day didn't cut hit clean off," muttered Nelse. </p>
               <p>"Mama, you can't send him back to be killed!" </p>
               <p>"Well darling, I'll see about it to-morrow." </p>
               <p>"Come on Dick, I'll show you where to sleep!" </p>
               <p>The next day Dick's mother was glad to get rid of him by binding him legally to
                  Mrs. Gaston, and a lonely boy found a playmate and partner in work, he was never
                  to forget. </p>

               <head> CHAPTER XVI<lb/> LEGREE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE </head>

               <p>The new government was now in full swing and a saturnalia began. Amos Hogg was
                  Governor, Simon Legree Speaker of the House, and the Hon. Tim Shelby leader of the
                  majority on the floor of the House. </p>
               <p>Raleigh, the quaint little City of Oaks, never saw such an assemblage of
                  law-makers gather in the grey stone Capitol. </p>
               <p>Ezra Perkins, who was a member of the Senate, was frugal in his habits and found
                  lodgings at an unpretentious boarding house near the Capitol square. </p>
               <p>The room was furnished with six iron cots on which were placed straw mattresses
                  and six honourable members of the new Legislature occupied these. They were close
                  enough together to allow a bottle of whiskey to be freely passed from member to
                  member at any hour of the night. They thought the beds were arranged with this in
                  view and were much pleased. </p>
               <p>Ezra was the only man of the crowd who arrived in Raleigh with a valise or trunk.
                  He had a carpet bag. The others simply had one shirt and a few odds and ends tied
                  in red bandana handkerchiefs. </p>
               <p>Three of them had walked all the way to Raleigh and kept in the woods from habit
                  as deserters. The other two rode on the train and handed their tickets to the
                  first stranger they saw on the platform of the car they boarded. <pb

               </p>
               <p>"What's this for?" said the stranger. </p>
               <p>"Them's our tickets. Ain't you the door keeper?" </p>
               <p>"No, but there ought to be one to every circus. You'll have me when you get to
                  Raleigh." </p>
               <p>The landlady, Mrs. Duke, apologised for the poor beds, when she showed them to
                  their room. "I'm sorry, gentlemen, I can't give you softer beds." </p>
               <p>"That's all right M'am! them's fine. Us fellows been sleeping in the woods and in
                  straw stacks so long dodgin' ole Vance's officers, them white sheets is the finest
                  thing we've seed in four years, er more." </p>
               <p>They were humble and made no complaints. But at the end of the week they gathered
                  around the Rev. Ezra Perkins for a grave consultation. </p>
               <p>"When are we goin' ter draw?" said one. </p>
               <p>"Air we ever goin' ter draw?" asked another with sorrow and doubt. </p>
               <p>"What are we here fer ef we cain't draw?" pleaded another looking sadly at Ezra. </p>
               <p>"Gentlemen,"answered Ezra, "it will be all right in a little while. The Treasurer
                  is just cranky. We can draw our mileage Monday anyhow." </p>
               <p>At daylight they took their places on the bank's steps, and at ten o'clock when
                  the bank opened, the doors were besieged by a mob of members painfully anxious to
                  draw before it might be too late. </p>
               <p>Next morning there was a disturbance at the breakfast table. The morning paper had
                  in blazing head lines an amount of one James "Mileage" who was a member of the
                  Legislature front an adjoining county thirty-seven miles distant. He had sworn to
                  a mileage record of one hundred and seven dollars. </p>
               <p>"That's an unfortunate mistake, sir," said Perkins. </p>
               <p>"Ten' ter yer own business?" answered James "Mileage." <pb

               </p>
               <p>"I call it er purty sharp trick," grinned his partner. </p>
               <p>"I call it stealin'," sneered an honourable member, evidently envious. </p>
               <p>And James "Mileage"was his name for all time, but "Mileage" shot a malicious look
                  at the member who had called him a thief. </p>
               <p>The next morning the paper of the Opposition had another biographical sketch on
                  the front page. </p>
               <p>"I see your name in the paper this morning, Mr. Scoggins?" remarked Mrs. Duke,
                  looking pleasantly at the member who had spoken so rudely to James "Mileage" the
                  day before. </p>
               <p>"Well I reckon I'll make my mark down here before it's over," chuckled Scoggins
                  with pride. "What do they say about me, M'am?" </p>
               <p>"They say you stole a lot of hogs!" tittered the landlady. </p>
               <p>Mr. Scoggins turned red. </p>
               <p>"Oho, is there another thief in this hon'able body?" sneered James "Mileage." </p>
               <p>"That's all a lie, M'am, 'bout them hogs. I didn' steal 'em. I just pressed 'em
                  from a Secessiner." </p>
               <p>"Jes so," said James "Mileage," "but they say you were a deserter at the time, and
                  not exactly in the service of your country." </p>
               <p>"Ye can't pay no 'tention ter rebel lies ergin Union men!" explained Scoggins,
                  eating faster. </p>
               <p>"Yes, that's so," said James "Mileage," "but there's another funny thing in the
                  paper about you." </p>
               <p>"What's that?" cried Scoggins with new alarm. </p>
               <p>"That Mr. Scoggins met Sherman's army with loud talk about lovin' the Union, but
                  that a mean Yankee officer gave him a cussin' fur not fightin' on one side or the
                  other, took all that bacon he had stolen, hung him <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0145" n="112"/> up by the heels, gave him thirty lashes
                  and left him hanging in the air." </p>
               <p>"It's a lie! It's a lie!" bellowed Scoggins. </p>
               <p>"Gentlemen! Gentlemen! we must not have such behaviour at my table!" exclaimed
                  Mrs. Duke. </p>
               <p>And "Hog" Scoggins was his name from that day. </p>
               <p>By the end of the week another painful story was printed about one of this group
                  of statesmen. The newspaper brutally declared that he had been convicted of
                  stealing a rawhide from a neighbour's tanyard. It could not be denied. And then a
                  sad thing happened. The moral sentiment of the little community could not endure
                  the strain. It suddenly collapsed. They laughed at these incidents of the sad past
                  and agreed that they were jokes. They began to call each other James "Mileage,"
                  "Hog" Scoggins, and "Rawhide "in the friendliest way, and dared a scornful world
                  to make them feel ashamed of anything! </p>
               <p>But the Rev. Ezra Perkins was pained by this breakdown. He felt that being safely
                  removed two thousand miles from his own past, he might hope for a future. </p>
               <p>"Mrs. Duke," he complained to his landlady, "I will have to ask you to give me a
                  room to myself. I'll pay double. I want quiet where I can read my Bible and
                  meditate occasionally." </p>
               <p>"Certainly Mr. Perkins, if you are wining to pay for it." </p>
               <p>It was so arranged. But this assumption of moral superiority by Perkins grieved
                  "Mileage," "Hog" and "Rawhide," and a coolness sprang up between them, until they
                  found Ezra one night in his place of meditation dead drunk and his room on fire.
                  He had gone to sleep in his chair with his empty bottle by his side, and knocked
                  the candle over on the bed. Then they agreed that forever after they would all
                  stand together, shoulder to <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0146" n="113"/> shoulder,
                  until they brought the haughty low and exalted the lowly and the "loyal." </p>
               <p>Tim Shelby early distinguished himself in this August assemblage. His wit and
                  eloquence from the first commanded the admiration of his party. </p>
               <p>When he had fairly established himself as leader, he rose in his seat one day with
                  unusual gravity. His scalp was working his ears with great rapidity showing his
                  excitement. </p>
               <p>He had in his hands a bill on which he had spent months in secret study. He had
                  not even hinted its contents to any of his associates. Under the call for bills
                  his voice rang with deep emphasis, </p>
               <p>"Mr. Speaker!" </p>
               <p>Legree gave him instant recognition. </p>
               <p>"I desire to introduce the following: "A Bill to be Entitled An Act to Relieve
                  Married Women from the Bonds of Matrimony when United to Felons, and to Define
                  Felony." </p>
               <p>A page hurried to the Reading Clerk with his bill. </p>
               <p>The hum of voices ceased. The five or six representatives of the white race left
                  their desks and walked quickly toward the Speaker. The Clerk read in a loud clear
                  voice. </p>
               <p>"The General Assembly of North Carolina do enact: </p>
               <p>I "That all citizens of the State who took part in the Rebellion and fought
                  against the Union, or held office in the so called Confederate States of America,
                  shall be held guilty of felony, and shall be forever debarred from voting or
                  holding office." </p>
               <p>II "That the married relations of all such felons are hereby dissolved and their
                  wives absolutely divorced, and said felons shall be forever barred from
                  contracting marriage or living under the same roof with their former wives." <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0147" n="114"/>
               </p>
               <p>Instantly four Carpet-bagger members of some education rushed for Tim's seat.
                  "Withdraw that bill, man, quick! My God, are you mad!" they all cried in a breath. </p>
               <p>Tim was dazed by this unexpected turn, and grinned in an obstinate way. </p>
               <p>"I can't see it gentlemen. That bill will kill out the breed of rebels and fix the
                  status of every Southern state for five hundred years. It's just what we need to
                  make this state loyal." </p>
               <p>"You pass that bill and hell will break loose!" </p>
               <p>"How so, brother? Ain't we on top and the rebels on the bottom? Ain't the army
                  here to protect us?" persisted Tim. </p>
               <p>There was a brief consultation among the little group in opposition and the leader
                  said, </p>
               <p>"Mr. Speaker, I move that the bill be at once printed and laid on the desk of the
                  members for consideration." </p>
               <p>Tim was astonished at this move of his enemy. Legree looked at him and waited his
                  pleasure. </p>
               <p>"Mr. Speaker, I withdraw that bill for the present," he said at length. </p>
               <p>That night the wires were hot between Washington and Raleigh, and the entire power
                  of Congress was hurled upon the unhappy Tim. His bill was not only suppressed but
                  the news agencies were threatened and subsidised to prevent accounts of its
                  introduction being circulated throughout the country. </p>
               <p>Tim decided to lay this measure over until Congress was off his hands, and the
                  state's autonomy fully recognised. Then he would dare interference. In the
                  meantime he turned his great mind to financial matters. His success here was
                  overwhelming. </p>
               <p>His first measure was to increase the per diem of the <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0148" n="115"/> members from three to seven dollars a
                  day. It passed with a whoop. </p>
               <p>Uncle Pete Sawyer a coal-black fatherly looking old darkey from an Eastern county
                  made himself immortal in that debate. </p>
               <p>"Mistah Speakah!" he bawled drawing himself up with great dignity, and holding a
                  pen in his left hand as though he had been writing. "What do dese white gem'men
                  mean by exposen dis bill? Ef we doan pay de members enuf, day des be erbleeged ter
                  steal. Hit aint right, sah, ter fo'ce de members er dis hon'able body ter prowl
                  atter dark when day otter be here 'tendin' ter de business o' de country. En I
                  moves you, sah, Mistah Speakah, dat dese rema'ks er mine be filed in de arkibes er
                  grabity!" </p>
               <p>They were filed and embalmed in the archives of gravity where they will remain a
                  monument to their author and his times. </p>
               <p>As Tim's great financial measures made progress, the members began to wear better
                  clothes, assumed white linen shirts, had their shoes blacked, and put on the airs
                  of overworked statesmen. </p>
               <p>When they had used up all the funds of the state in mileage and per diem, they
                  sold and divided the school fund, railroad bonds worth a half million, for a
                  hundred thousand ready cash. It was soon found that Simon Legree, the Speaker of
                  the House, was the master of financial measures and Tim Shelby was his mouthpiece. </p>
               <p>Legree organised three groups of thieves composed of the officials needed to
                  perfect the thefts in every branch of the government while he retained the
                  leadership of the federated groups. The Treasurer, who was an honest man, was
                  stripped of power by a special act. </p>
               <p>The Capitol Ring merely picked up the odds and ends about the Capitol building.
                  They refurnished the Legislative <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0149" n="116"/> Halls.
                  They spent over two hundred thousand dollars for furniture, and when it was
                  appraised, its value was found to be seventeen thousand dollars at the prices they
                  actually paid for it. The Ring stole one hundred and seventy thousand dollars on
                  this item alone. </p>
               <p>An appropriation of three hundred thousand dollars was made for "supplies,
                  sundries and incidentals." With this they built a booth around the statue of
                  Washington at the end of the Capitol and established a bar with fine liquors and
                  cigars for the free use of the members and their friends. They kept it open every
                  day and night during their reign, and in a suite of rooms in the Capitol they
                  established a brothel. From the galleries a swarm of courtesans daily smiled on
                  their favourites on the floor. </p>
               <p>The printing had never cost the state more than eight thousand dollars in any one
                  year. This year it cost four hundred and eighty thousand. Legree drew thousands of
                  warrants on the state for imaginary persons. There were eight pages in the House.
                  He drew pay for one hundred and fifty-six pages. In this way he raised an enormous
                  corruption fund for immediate use in bribing the lawmakers to carry through his
                  schemes. </p>
               <p>The Railroad Ring was his most effective group of brigands. </p>
               <p>They passed bills authorising the issue of twenty-five millions of dollars in
                  bonds, and actually issued and stole fourteen millions, and never built one foot
                  of railroad. </p>
               <p>When Legree's movement was at its high tide, Ezra Perkins sought Uncle Pete Sawyer
                  one night in behalf of a pet measure of his pending in the House. </p>
               <p>Peter was seated by his table counting by the light of a candle three big piles of
                  gold. </p>
               <p>His face was wreathed in smiles.<pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0150" n="117"/>
               </p>
               <p>"Peter, you seem well pleased with the world tonight?" said Ezra gleefully. </p>
               <p>"Well, brudder, you see dem piles er yaller money?" </p>
               <p>"Yes, it is a fine sight." </p>
               <p>Uncle Pete smacked his lips and grinned from ear to ear. </p>
               <p>"Well, brudder, I tells you. I ben sol' seben times in my life, but 'fore Gawd
                  dat's de fust time I ebber got de money!" </p>
               <p>Uncle Pete dreamed that night that Congress passed a law extending the blessings
                  of a "republican form of government" to North Carolina for forty years and that
                  the Legislature never adjourned. </p>
               <p>But the Legislature finally closed, and in a drunken revel which lasted all night.
                  They had bankrupted the state, destroyed its school funds, and increased its debt
                  from sixteen to forty-two millions of dollars, without adding one cent to its
                  wealth or power. </p>
               <p>Legree then organized a Municipal and County Ring to exploit the towns, cities,
                  and counties, having passed a bill vacating all county and city offices. </p>
               <p>This Ring secured the control of Hambright and levied a tax of twenty-five per
                  cent for municipal purposes! Tom Camp's little home was assessed for eighty-five
                  dollars in taxes. Mrs. Gaston's home was assessed for one hundred and sixty
                  dollars. They could have raised a million as easily as the sum of these
                  assessments. </p>
               <p>It cost the United States government two hundred millions of dollars that year to
                  pay the army required to guard the Legrees and their "loyal" men while they were
                  thus establishing and maintaining "a republican form of government" in the South. </p>

               <head> CHAPTER XVII<lb/> THE SECOND REIGN OF TERROR </head>

               <p>It was the bluest Monday the Rev. John Durham ever remembered in his ministry. A
                  long drought had parched the corn into twisted and stunted little stalks that
                  looked as though they had been burnt in a prairie fire. The fly had destroyed the
                  wheat crop and the cotton was dying in the blistering sun of August, and a blight
                  worse than drought, or flood, or pestilence, brooded over the stricken land,
                  flinging the shadow of its Black Death over every home. The tax gatherer of the
                  new "republican form of government," recently established in North Carolina now
                  demanded his pound of flesh. </p>
               <p>The Sunday before had been a peculiarly hard one for the Preacher. He had tried by
                  the sheer power of personal sympathy to lift the despairing people out of their
                  gloom and make strong their faith in God. In his morning sermon he had torn his
                  heart open and given them its red blood to drink. At the night service he could
                  not rally from the nerve tension of the morning. He felt that lie had pitiably
                  failed. The whole day seemed failure black and hopeless. </p>
               <p>All day long the sorrowful stories of ruin and loss of homes were poured into his
                  ear. </p>
               <p>The Sheriff had advertised for sale for taxes two thousand three hundred and
                  twenty homes in Campbell county. The land under such conditions had no value. <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0152" n="119"/> It was only a formality for the
                  auctioneer to cry it and knock it down for the amount of the tax bill. </p>
               <p>As he arose from bed with the burden of all this hopeless misery crushing his
                  soul, a sense of utter exhaustion and loneliness came over him. </p>
               <p>"My love, I must go back to bed and try to sleep. I lay awake last night until two
                  o'clock. I can't eat anything," he said to his wife as she announced breakfast. </p>
               <p>"John, dear, don't give up like that." </p>
               <p>"Can't help it." </p>
               <p>"But you must. Come, here is something that will tone you up. I found this note
                  under the front door this morning." </p>
               <p>"What is it?" </p>
               <p>"A notice from some of your admirers that you must leave this county in
                  forty-eight hours or take the consequences." </p>
               <p>He looked at this anonymous letter and smiled. </p>
               <p>"Not such a failure after all, am I?" he mused. </p>
               <p>"I thought that would help, you," she laughed. </p>
               <p>"Yes, I can eat breakfast on the strength of that." </p>
               <p>He spread this letter out beside his plate, and read and reread it as he ate while
                  his eyes flashed with a strange half humourous light. </p>
               <p>"Really, that's fine, isn't it?" "You sower of sedition and rebellion, hypocrite
                  and false prophet. The day has come to clean this county of treason and traitors.
                  If you dare to urge the people to further resistance to authority, there will be
                  one traitor less in this county." </p>
               <p>"That sounds like the voice of a Daniel come to judgment, don't it?" </p>
               <p>"I think Ezra Perkins might know something about it." </p>
               <p>"I am sure of it." <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0153" n="120"/>
               </p>
               <p>"Well, I'm duly grateful, it's done for you what your wife couldn't do, cheered
                  you up this morning!" </p>
               <p>"That is so, isn't it? It takes a violent poison sometimes to stimulate the
                  heart's action." </p>
               <p>"Now if you will work the garden for me, where I've been watering it the past
                  month, you will be yourself by dinner time." </p>
               <p>"I will. That's about all we've got to eat. I've had so salary in two months, and
                  I've no prospects for the next two months." </p>
               <p>He was at work in the garden when Charlie Gaston suddenly ran through the gate
                  toward him. His face was red, his eyes streaming with tears, and his breath coming
                  in gasps. </p>
               <p>"Doctor, they've killed Nelse! Mama says please come down to our house as quick as
                  you can." </p>
               <p>"Is he dead, Charlie?" </p>
               <p>"He's most dead. I found him down in the woods lying in a gully, one leg is
                  broken, there's a big gash over his eye, his back is beat to a jelly, and one of
                  his arms is broken. We put him in the wagon, and hauled him to the house. I'm
                  afraid he's dead now. Oh me!" The boy broke down and choked with sobs. </p>
               <p>"Run, Charlie, for the doctor, and I'll be there in a minute." </p>
               <p>The boy flew through the gate to the doctor's house. </p>
               <p>When the Preacher reached Mrs. Gaston's, Aunt Eve was wiping the blood from
                  Nelse's mouth. </p>
               <p>"De Lawd hab mussy! My po' ole man's done kilt." </p>
               <p>"Who could have done this, Eve?" </p>
               <p>"Dem Union Leaguers. Day say day wuz gwine ter kill him fur not jinin' 'em, en fur
                  tryin' ter vote ergin 'em." </p>
               <p>"I've been afraid of it," sighed the Preacher as he felt Nelse's pulse. <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0154" n="121"/>
               </p>
               <p>"Yassir, en now day's done hit. My po' ole man. I wish I'd a been better ter 'im.
                  Lawd Jesus, help me now!" </p>
               <p>Eve knelt by the bed and laid her face against Nelse's while the tears rained down
                  her black face. </p>
               <p>"Aunt Eve, it may not be so bad," said the Preacher hopefully. "His pulse is
                  getting stronger. He has an iron constitution. I believe he will pull through, if
                  there are no internal injuries." </p>
               <p>"Praise God! ef he do git well, I tell yer now, Marse John, I fling er spell on
                  dem niggers bout dis!" </p>
               <p>"I am afraid you can do nothing with them. The courts are all in the hands of
                  these scoundrels, and the Governor of the state is at the head of the Leagues." </p>
               <p>"I doan want no cotes, Marse John, I'se cote ennuf. I kin cunjure dem niggers
                  widout any cote." </p>
               <p>The doctor pronounced his injuries dangerous but not necessarily fatal. Charlie
                  and Dick watched with Eve that night until nearly midnight. Nelse opened his eyes,
                  and saw the eager face of the boy, his eyes yet red from crying. </p>
               <p>"I aint dead, honey!" he moaned. </p>
               <p>"Oh! Nelse, I'm so glad!" </p>
               <p>"Doan you believe I gwine die! I gwine ter git eben wid dem niggers 'fore I leab
                  dis worl'." </p>
               <p>Nelse spoke feebly, but there was a way about his saying it that boded no good to
                  his enemies, and Eve was silent. As Nelse improved, Eve's wrath steadily rose. </p>
               <p>The next day she met in the street one of the negroes who had threatened Nelse. </p>
               <p>"How's Mistah Gaston dis mawnin 'M'am?" he asked. </p>
               <p>Without a word of warning she sprang on him like a tigress, bore him to the
                  ground, grasped him by the throat and pounded his head against a stone. She would
                  have <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0155" n="122"/> choked him to death, had not a man
                  who was passing come to the rescue. </p>
               <p>"Lemme lone, man, I'se doin' de wuk er God!" </p>
               <p>"You're committing murder, woman." </p>
               <p>When the negro got up he jumped the fence and tore down through a corn field, as
                  though pursued by a hundred devils, now and then glancing over his shoulder to see
                  if Eve were after him. </p>
               <p>The Preacher tried in vain to bring the perpetrators of this outrage on Nelse to
                  justice. He identified six of them positively. They were arrested, and when put on
                  trial immediately discharged by the judge who was himself a member of the League
                  that had ordered Nelse whipped. </p>
               <p>* * * * * * </p>
               <p>Tom Camp's daughter was now in her sixteenth year and as plump and winsome a
                  lassie, her Scotch mother declared, as the Lord ever made. She was engaged to be
                  married to Hose Norman, a gallant poor white from the high hill country at the
                  foot of the mountains. Hose came to see her every Sunday riding a black mule,
                  gaily trapped out in martingales with red rings, double girths to his saddle and a
                  flaming red tassel tied on each side of the bridle. Tom was not altogether pleased
                  with his future so-in-law. He was too wild, went to too many frolics, danced too
                  much, drank too much whiskey and was too handy with a revolver. </p>
               <p>"Annie, child, you'd better think twice before you step off with that young buck,"
                  Tom gravely warned his daughter as he stroked her fair hair one Sunday morning
                  while she waited for Hose to escort her to church. </p>
               <p>"I have thought a hundred times, Paw, but what's the use. I love him. He can just
                  twist me 'round his little finger. I've got to have him." <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0156" n="123"/>
               </p>
               <p>"Tom Camp, you don't want to forget you were not a saint when I stood up with you
                  one day," cried his wife with a twinkle in her eye. </p>
               <p>"That's a fact, ole woman," grinned Tom. </p>
               <p>"You never give me a day's trouble after I got hold of you. Sometimes the wildest
                  colts make the safest horses" </p>
               <p>"Yes, that's so. It's owing to who has the breaking of 'em," thoughtfully answered
                  Tom. </p>
               <p>"I like Hose. He's full of fun, but he'll settle down and make her a good
                  husband." </p>
               <p>The girl slipped close to her mother and squeezed her hand. </p>
               <p>"Do you love him much, child?" asked her father. </p>
               <p>"Well enough to live and scrub and work for him and to die for him, I reckon." </p>
               <p>"All right, that settles it, you're too many for me, you and Hose and your Maw.
                  Get ready for it quick. We'll have the weddin' Wednesday night. This home is goin'
                  to be sold Thursday for taxes and it will be our last night under our own roof.
                  We'll make the best of it." </p>
               <p>It was so fixed. On Wednesday night Hose came down from the foothills with three
                  kindred spirits, and an old fiddler to make the music. He wanted to have a dance
                  and plenty of liquor fresh from the mountain-dew district. But Tom put his foot
                  down on it. </p>
               <p>"No dancin' in my house, Hose, and no licker," said Tom with emphasis. "I'm a
                  deacon in the Baptist church. I used to be young and as good lookin' as you, my
                  boy, but I've done with them things. You're goin' to take my little gal now. I
                  want you to quit your foolishness be a man." </p>
               <p>"I will, Tom, I will. She is the prettiest sweetest little thing in this world,
                  and to tell you the truth I'm <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0157" n="124"/> goin' to
                  settle right down now to the hardest work I ever did in my life." </p>
               <p>"That's the way to talk, my boy,"said Tom putting his hand an Hose's shoulder.
                  "You'll have enough to do these hard times to make a livin'." </p>
               <p>They made a handsome picture, in that humble home, as they stood there before the
                  Preacher. The young bride was trembling from head to foot with fright. Hose was
                  trying to look grave and dignified and grinning in spite of himself whenever he
                  looked into the face of his blushing mate. The mother was standing near, her face
                  full of pride in her daughter's beauty and happiness, her heart all a quiver with
                  the memories of her own wedding day seventeen years before. Tom was thinking of
                  the morrow when he would be turned out of his home and his eyes filled with tears. </p>
               <p>The Rev. John Durham had pronounced them man and wife and hurried away to see some
                  people who were sick. The old fiddler was doing his best. Hose and his bride were
                  shaking hands with their friends, and the boys were trying to tease the bridegroom
                  with hoary old jokes. </p>
               <p>Suddenly a black shadow fell across the doorway. The fiddle ceased, and every eye
                  was turned to the door. The burly figure of a big negro trooper from a company
                  stationed in the town stood before them. His face was in a broad grin, and his
                  eyes bloodshot with whiskey. He brought his musket down on the floor with a bang. </p>
               <p>"My frien's, I'se sorry ter disturb yer but I has orders ter search dis house." </p>
               <p>"Show your orders," said Tom hobbling before him. </p>
               <p>"Well, deres one un 'em !" he said still grinning as be cocked his gun and
                  presented it toward Tom. "En ef dat aint ennuf day's fifteen mo' stanin' 'roun'
                  dis house. It's no use ter make er fuss. Come on, boys!" <pb/>
                  <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0160" n="125"/>
               </p>
               <p>Before Tom could utter another word of protest six more negro troopers laughing
                  and nudging one another crowded into the room. Suddenly one of them threw a bucket
                  of water in the fire place where a pine knot blazed and two others knocked out the
                  candles. </p>
               <p>There was a scuffle, the quick thud of heavy blows, and Hose Norman fell to the
                  floor senseless. A piercing scream rang from his bride as she was seized in the
                  arms of the negro who first appeared. He rapidly bore her toward the door
                  surrounded by the six scoundrels who had accompanied him. </p>
               <p>"My God, save her! They are draggin' Annie out of the house," shrieked her mother. </p>
               <p>"Help! Help! Lord have mercy!" screamed the girl as they bore her away toward the
                  woods, still laughing and yelling. </p>
               <p>Tom overtook one of them, snatched his wooden leg off, and knocked him down.
                  Hose's mountain boys were crowding round Tom with their pistols in their hands. </p>
               <p>"What shall we do, Tom? If we shoot we may kill Annie." </p>
               <p>"Shoot, man! My God, shoot! There are things worse than death!" </p>
               <p>They needed no urging. Like young tigers they sprang across the orchard toward the
                  woods whence came the sound of the laughter of the negroes. </p>
               <p>"Stop de screechin'!" cried the leader. </p>
               <p>"She nebber get dat gag out now." </p>
               <p>"Too smart fur de po' white trash dis time sho'!" laughed one. </p>
               <p>Three pistol shots rang out like a single report! Three more! and three more!
                  There was a wild scramble. Taken completely by surprise, the negroes fled in
                  confusion. Four lay on the ground. Two were dead, one mortally wounded and three
                  more had crawled away with bullets <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0161" n="126"/> in
                  their bodies. There in the midst of the heap lay the unconscious girl gagged. </p>
               <p>"Is she hurt?" cried a mountain boy. </p>
               <p>"Can't tell, take her to the house quick." </p>
               <p>They laid her across the bed in the room that had been made sweet and tidy for the
                  bride and groom. The mother bent over her quickly with a light. Just where the
                  blue veins crossed in her delicate temple there was a round hole from which a
                  scarlet stream was running down her white throat. </p>
               <p>Without a word the mother brought Tom, showed it to him, and then fell into his
                  arms and burst into a flood of tears. </p>
               <p>"Don't, don't cry so Annie! It might have been worse. Let us thank God she was
                  saved from them brutes." </p>
               <p>Hose's friends crowded round Tom now with tear-stained faces. </p>
               <p>"Tom, you don't know how broke up we all are over this. Poor child, we did the
                  best we could." </p>
               <p>"It's all right, boys. You've been my friends to-night. You've saved my little
                  gal. I want to shake hands with you and thank you. If you hadn't been
                  here&mdash;My God, I can't think of what would 'a happened! Now it's all
                  right. She's safe in God's hands." </p>
               <p>The next morning when Tom Camp called at the parsonage to see the Preacher and
                  arrange for the funeral of his daughter he found him in bed. </p>
               <p>"Dr. Durham is quite sick, Mr. Camp, but he'll see you,"said Mrs. Durham. </p>
               <p>"Thank you, M'am." </p>
               <p>She took the old soldier by his hand and her voice choked as she said, </p>
               <p>"You have my heart's deepest sympathy in your awful sorrow." </p>
               <p>"It'll be all be the for best, M'am. The Lord gave and <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0162" n="127"/> the Lord has taken away. I will still
                  say, Blessed is the name of the Lord!" </p>
               <p>"I wish I had such faith." She led Tom into the room where the Preacher lay. </p>
               <p>"Why, what's this, Preacher? A bandage over your eye, looks like somebody knocked
                  you in the head?" </p>
               <p>"Yes, Tom, but it's nothing. I'll be all right by to-morrow. You needn't tell me
                  anything that happened at your house. I've heard the black hell-lit news. It will
                  be all over this county by night and the town will be full of grim-visaged men
                  before many hours. Your child has not died in vain. A few things like this will be
                  the trumpet of the God of our fathers that will call the sleeping manhood of the
                  Anglo-Saxon race to life again. I must be up and about this afternoon to keep down
                  the storm. It is not time for it to break." </p>
               <p>"But, Preacher, what happened to you?" </p>
               <p>"Oh! nothing much, Tom." </p>
               <p>"I'll tell you what happened," cried Mrs. Durham standing erect with her great
                  dark eyes flashing with anger. </p>
               <p>"As he came home last night from a visit to the sick, he was ambushed by a gang of
                  negroes led by a white scoundrel, knocked down, bound and gagged and placed on a
                  pile of dry fence rails. They set fire to the pile and left him to burn to death.
                  It attracted the attention of Doctor Graham who was passing. He got to him in time
                  to save him." </p>
               <p>"You don't say so!" </p>
               <p>"I'm sorry, Tom, I'm so weak this morning I couldn't come to see you. I know your
                  poor wife is heartbroken." </p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, she is, and it cuts me to the quick when I think that I gave the orders
                  to the boys to shoot. But, Preacher, I'd a killed her with own hand if I couldn't
                     <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0163" n="128"/> a saved her no other way. I'd do it
                  over again a thousand times if I had to." </p>
               <p>"I don't blame you, I'd have done the same thing. I can't come to see you to-day,
                  Tom, I'll be down to your house to-morrow a few minutes before we start for the
                  cemetery. I must get up for dinner and prevent the men from attacking these
                  troops. They'll not dare to try to sell your place to-day. The public square is
                  full of men now, and it's only nine o'clock. You go home and cheer up your wife.
                  How is Hose?" </p>
               <p>"He's still in bed. The Doctor says his skull is broken in one place, but he'll be
                  over it in a few weeks." </p>
               <p>Tom hobbled back to his house, shaking hands with scores of silent men on the way. </p>
               <p>The Preacher crawled to his desk and wrote this note to the young officer in
                  command of the post, </p>
               <p>MY DEAR CAPTAIN,<lb/> In the interest of peace and order I would advise you to
                  telegraph to Independence for two companies of white regulars to come immediately
                  on a special, and that you start your negro troops on double quick marching order
                  to meet them. There will be a thousand armed men in Hambright by sundown, and no
                  power on earth can prevent the extermination of that negro company if they attack
                  them. I will do my best to prevent further bloodshed but I can do nothing if these
                  troops remain here to-day.<lb/> Respectfully,<lb/> JOHN DURHAM. </p>
               <p>The Commandant acted an the advice immediately. </p>

                  Independence had been saved by a skillful movement of General Worth, who sought an
                  interview with Legree when his council first issued their levy of thirty per cent
                  for municipal purposes. </p>
               <p>"Mr. Legree, let's understand one another," said the General. </p>
               <p>"All right, I'm a man of reason." </p>
               <p>"A bird in hand is worth two in the bush!" </p>
               <p>"Every time, General." </p>
               <p>"Well, call off your dogs, and rescind your order for a thirty per cent tax levy,
                  and I'll raise $30,000 in cash and pay it to you in two days." </p>
               <p>"Make it $50,000 and it's a bargain." </p>
               <p>"Agreed." </p>
               <p>The General raised twenty thousand in the city, went North and borrowed the
                  remaining thirty thousand. </p>
               <p>Legree and his brigands received this ransom and moved on to the next town. </p>
               <p>Poor Hambright was but a scrawny little village on a red hill with no big values
                  to be saved, and no mills to interest the commercial world, and the auctioneer
                  lifted his hammer. </p>

               <head> CHAPTER XIX<lb/> THE RALLY OF THE CLANSMEN </head>

               <p>When the Preacher took the train in Boston for the South, his friendly merchant, a
                  deacon, was by his side. </p>
               <p>"Now, you put my name and address down in your note book, William Crane. And don't
                  forget about us." </p>
               <p>"I'll never forget you, deacon." </p>
               <p>"Say, I just as well tell you," whispered the deacon bending close, "we are not
                  going to allow you to stay down South. We'll be down after you before
                  long&mdash;just as well be packing up." </p>
               <p>The Preacher smiled, looked out of the car window, and made no reply. </p>
               <p>"Well, good-bye, Doctor, good-bye. God bless you and your work and your people!
                  You've brought me a message warm from God's heart. I'll never forget it." </p>
               <p>"Good-bye deacon." </p>
               <p>As the train whirled southward through the rich populous towns and cities of the
                  North, again the sharp contrast with the desolation of his own land cut him like a
                  knife. He thought of Legree and Haley, Perkins and Tim Shelby robbing widows and
                  orphans and sweeping the poverty-stricken Southland with riot, pillage, murder and
                  brigandage, and posing as the representatives of the conscience of the North. And
                  his heart was heavy with sorrow. </p>
               <p>On reaching Hambright he was thunderstruck at the <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0181"
                     n="144"/> news of the sale of Mrs. Gaston's place and her tragic death. </p>
               <p>"Why, my dear, I sent the money to her on the first Monday I spent in Boston!" he
                  declared to his wife. </p>
               <p>"It never reached her." </p>
               <p>"Then Dave Haley, the dirty slave driver, has held that letter. I'll see to this."
                  He hurried to the post-office. </p>
               <p>"Mr. Haley," he exclaimed, "I sent a money order letter to Mrs. Gaston from Boston
                  on Monday a week ago." </p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," answered Haley in his blandest manner, "it got here the day after the
                  sale." </p>
               <p>"You're an infamous liar!" shouted the Preacher. </p>
               <p>"Of course! Of course! All Union men are liars to bear rebel traitors talk." </p>
               <p>"I'll report you to Washington for this rascality." </p>
               <p>"So do, so do. Mor'n likely the President and the Post-Office Department 'll be
                  glad to have this information from so great a man." </p>
               <p>As the Preacher was leaving the post-office be encountered the Hon. Tim Shelby
                  dressed in the height of fashion, his silk hat shining in the sun, and his eyes
                  rolling with the joy of living. The Preacher stepped squarely in front of Tim. </p>
               <p>"Tim Shelby, I hear you have moved into Mrs. Gaston's home and are using her
                  furniture. By whose authority do you dare such insolence?" </p>
               <p>"By authority of the law, sir. Mrs. Gaston died intestate. Her effects are in the
                  hands of our County Administrator, Mr. Ezra Perkins. I'll be pleased to receive
                  you, sir, any time you would like to call I!" said Tim with a bow. </p>
               <p>"I'll call in due time," replied the Preacher, looking Tim straight in the eye.
                     <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0182" n="145"/>
               </p>
               <p>Haley had been peeping through the window, watching and listening to this
                  encounter. </p>
               <p>"'These charmin' preachers think they own this county, brother Shelby," laughed
                  Haley as he grasped Tim's outstretched hand. </p>
               <p>"Yes, they are the curse of the state. I wish to God they had succeeded in burning
                  him alive that night the boys tried it. They'll get him later on. Brother Haley,
                  he's a dangerous man. He must be put out of the way, or we'll never have smooth
                  sailing in this county." </p>
               <p>"I believe you're right, he's just been in here cussin' me about that letter of
                  the widder's that didn't get to her in time. He thinks he can run the
                  post-office." </p>
               <p>"Well, we'll show him this county's in the hands of the loyal!" added Tim. </p>
               <p>"Heard the news from Charleston?" </p>
               <p>"Heard it? I guess I have. I talked with the commanding General in Charleston two
                  weeks ago. He told me then he was going to set aside that decision of the Supreme
                  Court in a ringing order permitting the marriage of negroes to white women, and
                  commanding its enforcement on every military post. I see he's done it in no
                  uncertain words." </p>
               <p>"It's a great day, brother, for the world. There'll be no more colour line." </p>
               <p>"Yes, times have changed," said Tim with a triumphant smile. "I guess our white
                  hot-bloods will sweat and bluster and swear a little when they read that order.
                  But we've got the bayonets to enforce it. They'd just as well cool down." </p>
               <p>"That's the stuff," said Haley, taking a fresh chew of tobacco. </p>
               <p>"Let 'em squirm. They're flat on their backs. We are on top, and we are going to
                  stay on top. I expect to lead a fair white bride into my house before another year
                     <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0183" n="146"/> and have poor white aristocrats to
                  tend my lawn." Tim worked his ears and looked up at the ceiling in a dreamy sort
                  of way. </p>
               <p>"That'll be a sight won't it!" exclaimed Haley with delight. "Where's that
                  scoundrel Nelse that lived with Mrs. Gaston ?" </p>
               <p>"Oh, we fixed him," said Tim. "The black rascal wouldn't join the League, and
                  wouldn't vote with his people, and still showed fight after we beat him half to
                  death, so we put a levy of fifty dollars on his cabin, sold him out, and every
                  piece of furniture, and every rag of clothes we could get hold of. He'll leave the
                  country now, or we'll kill him next time." </p>
               <p>"You ought to a killed him the first time, and then the job would ha' been over." </p>
               <p>"Oh, we'll have the country in good shape in a little while, and don't you forget
                  it." </p>
               <p>The news of the order of the military commandant at "District No. 2," comprising
                  the Carolinas, abrogating the decisions of the North Carolina Supreme Court,
                  forbidding the intermarriage of negroes and whites, fell like a bombshell on
                  Campbell county. The people had not believed that the military authorities would
                  dare go to the length of attempting to force social equality. </p>
               <p>This order from Charleston was not only explicit, its language was peculiarly
                  emphatic. It apparently commanded intermarriage, and ordered the military to
                  enforce the command at the point of the bayonet. </p>
               <p>The feelings of the people were wrought to the pitch of fury. It needed but a word
                  from a daring leader, and a massacre of every negro, scalawag and carpet-bagger in
                  the county might have followed. The Rev. John Durham was busy day and night
                  seeking to allay excitement and prevent an uprising of the white population. </p>
               <p>Along with the announcement of this military order, <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0184" n="147"/> came the startling news that Simon
                  Legree, whose infamy was known from end to end of the state, was to be the next
                  Governor, and that the Hon. Tim Shelby was a candidate for Chief justice of the
                  Supreme Court. </p>
               <p>Legree was in Washington at the time an a mission to secure a stand of twenty
                  thousand rifles from the Secretary of War, with which to arm the negro troop he
                  was drilling for the approaching election. The grant was made and Legree came back
                  in triumph with his rifles. </p>
               <p>Relief for the ruined people was now a hopeless dream. Black despair was clutching
                  at every white man's heart. The taxpayers had held a convention and sent their
                  representatives to Washington exposing the monstrous thefts that were being
                  committed under the authority of the government by the organised band of thieves
                  who were looting the state. But the thieves were the pets of politicians high in
                  power. The committee of taxpayers were insulted and sent home to pay their taxes. </p>
               <p>And then a thing happened in Hambright that brought matters to a sudden crisis. </p>
               <p>The Hon. Tim Shelby as school commissioner, had printed the notices for an
                  examination of school teachers for Campbell county. An enormous tax had been
                  levied and collected by the county for this purpose, but no school had been
                  opened. Tim announced, however, that the school would be surely opened the first
                  Monday in October. </p>
               <p>Miss Mollie Graham, the pretty niece of the old doctor, was struggling to support
                  a blind mother and four younger children. Her father and brother had been killed
                  in the war. Their house had been sold for taxes, and they were required now to pay
                  Tim Shelby ten dollars a month for rent. When she saw that school notice <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0185" n="148"/> her heart gave a leap. If she could only
                  get the place, it would save them from beggary. </p>
               <p>She fairly ran to the Preacher to get his advice. </p>
               <p>"Certainly, child, try for it. It's humiliating to ask such a favour of that black
                  ape, but if you can save your loved ones, do it." </p>
               <p>So with trembling hand she knocked at Tim's door. He required all applicants to
                  apply personally at his house. Tim met her with the bows and smirks of a dancing
                  master. </p>
               <p>"Delighted to see your pretty face this morning, Miss Graham," he cried
                  enthusiastically. </p>
               <p>The girl blushed and hesitated at the door. </p>
               <p>"Just walk right in the parlour, I'll join you in a moment." </p>
               <p>She bravely set her lips and entered. </p>
               <p>"And now what can I do for you, Miss Graham?" </p>
               <p>"I've come to apply for a teacher's place in the school." </p>
               <p>"Ah indeed, I'm glad to know that. There is only one difficulty. You must be
                  loyal. Your people were rebels, and the new government has determined to have only
                  loyal teachers." </p>
               <p>"I think I'm loyal enough to the old flag now that our people have surrendered,"
                  said the girl. </p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, I dare say, but do you think you can accept the new r&eacute;gime
                  of government and society which we are now establishing in the South? We have
                  abolished the colour line. Would you have a mixed school if assigned one?" </p>
               <p>"I think Id prefer to teach a negro school outright to a mixed one," she said
                  after a moment's hesitation. </p>
               <p>Tim continued, "You know we are living in a new world. The supreme law of the land
                  has broken down every barrier of race and we are henceforth to be one people. The
                  struggle for existence knows no race or <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0186" n="149"/>
                  colour. It's a struggle now for bread. I'm in a position to be of great help to
                  you and your family if you will only let me." </p>
               <p>The girl suddenly rose impelled by some resistless instinct. </p>
               <p>"May I have the place then?" she asked approaching the door. </p>
               <p>"Well, now you know it depends really altogether on my fancy. I'll tell you what
                  I'll do. You're still full of silly prejudices. I can see that. But if you will
                  overcome them enough to do one thing for me as a test, that will cost you nothing
                  and of which the world will never be the wiser, I'll give you the place and more,
                  I'll remit the ten dollars a month rent you're now paying. Will you do it?" </p>
               <p>"What is it?" the girl asked with pale quivering lips. </p>
               <p>"Let me kiss you&mdash;once!" he whispered. </p>
               <p>With a scream, she sprang past him out of the door, ran like a deer across the
                  lawn, and fell sobbing in her mother's arms when she reached her home. </p>
               <p>The next day the town was unusually quiet. Tim had business with the Commandant of
                  the company of regulars still quartered at Hambright. He spent most of the day
                  with him, and walked about the streets ostentatiously showing his familiarity with
                  the corporal who accompanied him. A guard of three soldiers was stationed around
                  Tim's house for two nights and then withdrawn. </p>
               <p>The next night at twelve o'clock two hundred white-robed horses assembled around
                  the old home of Mrs. Gaston where Tim was sleeping. The moon was full and flooded
                  the lawn with silver glory. On those horses sat two hundred white-robed silent men
                  whose close-fitting hood disguises looked like the mail helmets of ancient
                  knights. </p>
               <p>It was the work of a moment to seize Tim, and bind <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0187" n="150"/> him across a horse's back. Slowly the
                  grim procession moved to the court house square. </p>
               <p>When the sun rose next morning the lifeless body of Tim Shelby was dangling from a
                  rope tied to the iron rail of the balcony of the court house. His neck was broken
                  and his body was hanging low&mdash;scarcely three feet from the ground. His
                  thick lips had been split with a sharp knife and from his teeth hung this placard: </p>
               <p>"The answer of the Anglo-Saxon race to Negro lips that dare pollute with words the
                  womanhood of the South. K. K. K." </p>
               <p>And the Ku Klux Klan was master of Campbell county. </p>
               <p>The origin of this Law and Order League which sprang up like magic in a night and
                  nullified the programme of Congress though backed by an army of a million veteran
                  soldiers, is yet a mystery. </p>
               <p>The simple truth is, it was a spontaneous and resistless racial uprising of
                  clansmen of highland origin living along the Appalachian mountains and foothills
                  of the South, and it appeared almost simultaneously in every Southern state
                  produced by the same terrible conditions. </p>
               <p>It was the answer to their foes of a proud and indomitable race of men driven to
                  the wall. In the hour of their defeat they laid down their arms and accepted in
                  good faith the results of the war. And then, when unarmed and defenceless, a group
                  of pot-house politicians for political ends, renewed the war, and attempted to
                  wipe out the civilisation of the South. </p>
               <p>This Invisible Empire of White Robed Anglo-Saxon Knights was simply the old answer
                  of organised manhood to organised crime. Its purpose was to bring order out of
                  chaos, protect the weak and defenseless, the widows and orphans of brave men who
                  had died for their country, to drive from power the thieves who were robbing <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0188" n="151"/> the people, redeem the commonwealth from
                  infamy, and reestablish civilisation. </p>
               <p>Within one week from its appearance, life and property were as safe as in any
                  Northern community. </p>
               <p>When the negroes came home from their League meeting one night they ran terror
                  stricken past long rows of white horsemen. Not a word was spoken, but that was the
                  last meeting the "Union League of America" ever held in Hambright. </p>
               <p>Every negro found guilty of a misdemeanor was promptly thrashed and warned against
                  its recurrence. The sudden appearance of this host of white cavalry grasping at
                  their throats with the grip of cold steel struck the heart of Legree and his
                  followers with the chill of a deadly fear. </p>
               <p>It meant inevitable ruin, overthrow, and a prison cell for the "loyal" statesmen
                  who were with him in his efforts to maintain the new "republican form of
                  government" in North Carolina. </p>
               <p>At the approaching election, this white terror could intimidate every negro in the
                  state unless he could arm them all, suspend the writ of Habeas Corpus, and place
                  every county under the strictest martial law. </p>
               <p>Washington was besieged by a terrified army of the "loyal" who saw their
                  occupation threatened. They begged for more troops, more guns for negro militia,
                  and for the reestablishment of universal martial law until the votes were properly
                  counted. </p>
               <p>But the great statesmen laughed them to scorn as a set of weak cowards and fools
                  frightened by negro stories of ghosts. It was incredible to them that the crushed,
                  poverty stricken and unarmed South could dare challenge the power of the National
                  Government. They were sent back with scant comfort. </p>
               <p>The night that Ezra Perkins and Haley got back from <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0189" n="152"/> Washington, where they had gone summoned
                  by Legree and Hogg, to testify to the death of Tim Shelby, they saw a sight that
                  made their souls quake. </p>
               <p>At ten o'clock, the Ku Klux Klan held a formal parade through the streets of
                  Hambright. How the news was circulated nobody knew, but it seemed everybody in the
                  county knew of it. The streets were lined with thousands of people who had poured
                  in town that afternoon. </p>
               <p>At exactly ten o'clock, a bugle call was heard on the hill to the west of the
                  town, and the muffled tread of soft shod horses came faintly on their ears. Women
                  stood on the sidewalks, holding their babies and smiling, and children were
                  laughing and playing in the streets. </p>
               <p>They rode four abreast in perfect order slowly through the town. It was utterly
                  impossible to recognise a man or a horse, so complete was the simple disguise of
                  the white sheet which blanketed the horse fitting closely over his head and ears
                  and falling gracefully over his form toward the ground. </p>
               <p>No citizen of Hambright was in the procession. They were all in the streets
                  watching it pass. There were fifteen hundred men in line. But the reports next day
                  all agreed in fixing the number at over five thousand. </p>
               <p>Perkins and Haley had watched it from a darkened room. </p>
               <p>"Brother Haley, that's the end! Lord I wish I was back in Michigan, jail er no
                  jail," said Perkins mopping the perspiration from his brow. </p>
               <p>"We'll have ter dig out purty quick, I reckon," answered Haley. </p>
               <p>"And to think them fools at Washington laughed at us!" cried Perkins clinching his
                  fists. </p>
               <p>And that night, mothers and fathers gathered their children to bed with a sense of
                  grateful security not felt through years of war and turmoil. </p>

               <head> CHAPTER XX<lb/> HOW CIVILISATION WAS SAVED </head>

               <p>The success of the Ku Klux Klan was so complete, its organisers were dazed. Its
                  appeal to the ignorance and superstition of the Negro at once reduced the race to
                  obedience and order. Its threat against the scalawag and carpet-bagger struck
                  terror to their craven souls, and the "Union League," "Red Strings," and "Heroes
                  of America" went to pieces with incredible rapidity. </p>
               <p>Major Stuart Dameron, the chief of the Klan in Campbell county, was holding a
                  conference with the Rev. John Durham in his study. </p>
               <p>"Doctor, our work has succeeded beyond our wildest dream." </p>
               <p>"Yes, and I thank God we can breathe freely if only for a moment, Major. The
                  danger now lies in our success. We are necessarily playing with fire." </p>
               <p>"I know it, and it requires my time day and night to prevent reckless men from
                  disgracing us." </p>
               <p>"It will not be necessary to enforce the death penalty against any other man in
                  this county, Major. The execution of Tim Shelby was absolutely necessary at the
                  time and it has been sufficient." </p>
               <p>"I agree with you. I've impressed this on the matter of every lodge, but some of
                  them are growing reckless." </p>
               <p>"Who are they?" </p>
               <p>"Young Allan McLeod for one. He is a dare devil and only eighteen years old." <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0191" n="154"/>
               </p>
               <p>"He's a troublesome boy. I don't seem to have any influence with him. But I think
                  Mrs. Durham can manage him. He seems to think a great deal of her, and in spite of
                  his wild habits, he comes regularly to her Sunday School class." </p>
               <p>"I hope she can bring him to his senses." </p>
               <p>"Leave him to me then a while. We will see what can be done." </p>
               <p>* * * * * * </p>
               <p>Hogg's Legislature promptly declared the Scotch-Irish hill counties in a state of
                  insurrection, passed a militia bill, and the Governor issued a proclamation
                  suspending the writ of Habeas Corpus in these counties. </p>
               <p>Fearing the effects of negro militia in the hill districts, he surprised Hambright
                  by suddenly marching into the court house square a regiment of white mountain
                  guerillas recruited from the outlaws of East Tennessee and commanded by a noted
                  desperado, Colonel Henry Berry. The regiment had two pieces of field artillery. </p>
               <p>It was impossible for them to secure evidence against any member of the Klan
                  unless by the intimidation of some coward who could be made to confess. Not a
                  disguise had even been penetrated. It was the rule of the order for its decrees to
                  be executed in the district issuing the decree by the lodge furthest removed in
                  the county from the scene. In this way not a man or a horse was ever identified. </p>
               <p>The Colonel made an easy solution of this difficulty, however. Acting under
                  instructions from Governor Hogg, he secured from Haley and Perkins a list of every
                  influential man in every precinct in the county, and a list of possible turncoats
                  and cowards. He detailed five hundred of his men to make arrests, distributed them
                  throughout the county and arrested without warrants over two hundred citizens in
                  one day. <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0192" n="155"/>
               </p>
               <p>The next day Berry hand-cuffed together the Rev. John Durham and Major Dameron,
                  and led than escorted by a company of cavalry on a grand circuit of the county,
                  that the people might be terrified by the sight of their chains. An ominous
                  silence greeted them on every hand. Additional arrests were made by this troop and
                  twenty-five more prisoners led into Hambright the next day." </p>
               <p>The jail was crowded, and the court house was used as a jail. Over a hundred and
                  fifty men were confined in the court room. Rev. John Durham was everywhere among
                  the crowd, laughing, joking and cheering the men. </p>
               <p>"Major Dameron, a jail never held so many honest men before," he said with a
                  smile, as he looked over the crowd of his church members gathered from every
                  quarter of the county. </p>
               <p>"Well, Doctor, you've got a quorum here of your church and you can call them to
                  order for business." </p>
               <p>"That's a fact, isn't it?" </p>
               <p>"There's old Deacon Kline over there who looks like he wished he hadn't come! The
                  Preacher walked over to the deacon. </p>
               <p>"What's the matter, brother Kline, you look pensive." </p>
               <p>The deacon laughed. "Yes, I don't like my bed. I'm used to feathers." </p>
               <p>"Well, they say they are going to give you feathers mixed with tar so you won't
                  lose them so easily." </p>
               <p>"I'll have company, I reckon," said the deacon with a wink. </p>
               <p>"The funny thing, deacon, is that Major Dameron tells me there isn't a man in all
                  the crowd of two hundred fifty arrested who ever went on a raid. It's too bad you
                  old fellows have to pay for the follies of youth." </p>
               <p>"It is tough. But we can stand it, Preacher." They clasped hands. <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0193" n="156"/>
               </p>
               <p>"Haven't smelled a coward anywhere have you, deacon?" </p>
               <p>"I've seen one or two a little fidgety, I thought. Cheer 'em up with a word,
                  Preacher." </p>
               <p>Springing on the platform of the judge's desk he looked ever the crowd for a
                  moment, and a cheer shook the building. </p>
               <p>"Boys, I don't believe there's a single coward in our ranks." Another cheer. </p>
               <p>"Just keep cool now and let our enemies do the talking. In ten days every man of
                  you will be back at home at his work." </p>
               <p>"How will we get out with the writ suspended?" asked a man standing near. </p>
               <p>"That's the richest thing of all. A United States judge has just decided that the
                  Governor of the state cannot suspend the rights of a citizen of the United States
                  under the new Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution so recently rammed down our
                  throats. Hogg is hoisted on his own petard. Our lawyers are now serving out writs
                  of Habeas Corpus before this Federal judge under the Fourteenth Amendment, and you
                  will be discharged in less than ten days unless there's a skunk among you. And I
                  don't smell one anywhere." Again a cheer shook the building. </p>
               <p>An orderly walked up to the Preacher and handed him a note. </p>
               <p>"Read it!" the men crowded around. </p>
               <p>"Read it, Major Dameron, I'm dumb," said the Preacher. </p>
               <p>"A military order from the dirty rascal, Berry, commanding the mountain bummers,
                  forbidding the Rev. John Durham, to speak during his imprisonment!" </p>
               <p>A roar of laughter followed this announcement. <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0194"
                     n="157"/>
               </p>
               <p>"That's cruel! It'll kill him!" cried Deacon Kline as he jabbed the Preacher in
                  the ribs. </p>
               <p>In a few minutes, the Preacher was back in his place with five of the best singers
                  from his church by his side. He began to sing the old hymns of Zion and every man
                  in the room joined until the building quivered with melody. </p>
               <p>"Now a good old Yankee hymn, that suits this hour, written by an old Baptist
                  preacher I met in Boston the other day!" cried the Preacher. </p>
               <lg type="verse">
                  <l>"My country 'tis of thee, </l>
                  <l>Sweet land of liberty, </l>
                  <l>of thee I sing!" </l>
               </lg>

               <p>Heavens, how they sang it, while the Preacher lined it off, stood above them
                  beating time, and led in a clear mighty Voice! Again the orderly appeared with a
                  note. </p>
               <p>"What is it now?" they cried on every side. </p>
               <p>Again Major Dameron announced "Military order No. 2, forbidding the Rev. John
                  Durham to sing or induce anybody to sing while is prison." </p>
               <p>Another roar of laughter that broke into a cheer which made the glass rattle. When
                  the soldier had disappeared, the Rev. John Durham ascended the platform, looked
                  about him with a humourous twinkle in his eye, straightened himself to his full
                  height and crowded like a rooster! A cheer shook the building to its foundations.
                  Roar after roar of its defiant cadence swept across the square and made Haley and
                  Perkins tremble as they looked at each other over their conference table with
                  Berry. </p>
               <p>"What the devil's the matter now?" cried Haley. </p>
               <p>"Do you suppose it's a rescue?" whispered Perkins. </p>
               <p>"No, it's some new trick of that damned Preacher. I'll chain him in a room to
                  himself," growled Berry. <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0195" n="158"/>
               </p>
               <p>"Better not, Colonel. He's the pet of these white devils. Ye'd better let him
                  alone." Berry accepted the advice. </p>
               <p>Five days later the prisoners were arraigned before the United States judge,
                  Preston Rivers, at Independence. Not a scrap of evidence could be produced against
                  them. Governor Hogg was present, with a flaming military escort. He held a stormy
                  interview with Judge Rivers. </p>
               <p>"If you discharge these prisoners, you destroy the government of this state, sir!"
                  thundered Hogg. </p>
               <p>"Are they not citizens of the United States? Does not the Fourteenth Amendment
                  apply to a white man as well as a negro?" quietly asked the judge. </p>
               <p>"Yes, but they are conspirators against the Union. They are murderers and felons." </p>
               <p>"Then prove it in my court and I'll hand them back to you. They are entitled to a
                  trial, under our Constitution." </p>
               <p>"I'll demand your removal by the President," shouted Hogg. </p>
               <p>"Get out of this room, or I'll remove you with the point of my boot!" thundered
                  the judge with rising wrath. "You have suspended the writ of Habeas Corpus to win
                  a political campaign. The Ku Klux Klan has broken up your Leagues. You are
                  fighting for your life. But I'll tell you now, you can't suspend the Constitution
                  of the United States while I'm a Federal judge in this state. I am not a henchman
                  of yours to do your dirty campaign work. The election is but ten days off. Your
                  scheme is plain enough. But if you want to keep these men in prison it will be
                  done on sworn evidence of guilt and a warrant, not on your personal whim." </p>
               <p>The Governor cursed, raved and threatened in vain. Judge Rivers discharged every
                  prisoner and warned Colonel <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0196" n="159"/> Berry
                  against the repetition of such arrests within his jurisdiction. </p>
               <p>When these prisoners were discharged, a great mass-meeting was called to give them
                  a reception in the public square of Independence. A platform was hastily built in
                  the square and that night five thousand excited people crowded past the stand,
                  shook hands with the men and cheered till they were hoarse. The Governor watched
                  the demonstration in helpless fury from his room in the hotel. </p>
               <p>The speaking began at nine o'clock. Every discordant element of the old South's
                  furious political passions was now melted into harmonious unity. Whig and Democrat
                  who had fought one another with relentless hatred sat side by side on that
                  platform. Secessionist and Unionist now clasped hands. It was a White Man's Party,
                  and against it stood in solid array the Black Man's Party, led by Simon Legree. </p>
               <p>Henceforth there could be but one issue, are you a White Man or a Negro? </p>
               <p>They declared there was but one question to be settled:&mdash; </p>
               <p>"Shall the future American be an Anglo-Saxon or a Mulatto? </p>
               <p>These determined impassioned men believed that this question was more important
                  than any theory of tariff or finance and that it was larger than the South, or
                  even the nation, and held in its solution the brightest hopes of the progress of
                  the human race. And they believed that they were ordained of God in this crisis to
                  give this question its first authoritative answer. </p>
               <p>The state burst into a flame of excitement that fused in its white heat the whole
                  Anglo-Saxon race. </p>
               <p>In vain Hogg marched and counter-marched his twenty thousand state troops. They
                  only added fuel to <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0197" n="160"/> the fire. If they
                  arrested a man, he became forthwith a hero and was given an ovation. They sent
                  bands of music and played at the jail doors, and the ladies filled the jail with
                  every delicacy that could tempt the appetite or appeal to the senses. </p>
               <p>Hogg and Legree were in panic of fear with the certainty of defeat, exposure and a
                  felon's cell before them. </p>
               <p>Two days before the election, the prayer meeting was held at eight o'clock in the
                  Baptist church at Hambright. It was the usual mid-week service, but the attendance
                  was unusually large. </p>
               <p>After the meeting, the Preacher, Major Dameron, and eleven men quietly walked back
                  to the church and assembled in the pastor's study. The door opened at the rear of
                  the church and could be approached by a side street. </p>
               <p>"Gentlemen," said Major Dameron, "I've asked you here to-night to deliver to you
                  the most important order I have ever given, and to have Dr. Durham as our chaplain
                  to aid me in impressing on you its great urgency." </p>
               <p>"We're ready for orders, Chief," said young Ambrose Kline, the deacon's son. </p>
               <p>"You are to call out every troop of the Klan in full force the night before the
                  election. You are to visit every negro in the county, and warn every one as he
                  values his life not to approach the polls at this election. Those who come, will
                  be allowed to vote without molestation. All cowards will stay at home. Any man,
                  black or white, who can be scared out of his ballot is not fit to have one. Back
                  of every ballot is the red blood of the man that votes. The ballot is force. This
                  is simply a test of manhood. It will be enough to show who is fit to rule the
                  state. As the masters of the eleven township lodges of the Klan, you are the sole
                  guardians of society to-day. <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0198" n="161"/> When a
                  civilised government has been restored, your work will be done." </p>
               <p>"We will do it, sir," cried Kline. </p>
               <p>"Let me say, men," said the Preacher, "that I heartily endorse the plan of your
                  chief. See that the work is done thoroughly and it will be done for all time. In a
                  sense this is fraud. But it is the fraud of war. The spy is a fraud, but we must
                  use him when we fight. Is war justifiable? </p>
               <p>"It is too late now for us to discuss that question. We an in a war, the most
                  ghastly and hellish ever waged, a war on women and children, the starving and the
                  wounded, and that with sharpened swords. The Turk and Saracen once waged such a
                  war. We must face it and fight it out. Shall we flinch?" </p>
               <p>"No! no!" came the passionate answer from every man. </p>
               <p>"You are asked to violate for the moment a statutory law. There is a higher law.
                  You are the sworn officers of that higher law." </p>
               <p>The group of leaders left the church with enthusiasm and on the following night
                  they carried out their instructions to the letter. </p>
               <p>The election was remarkably quiet. Thousands of soldiers were used at the polls by
                  Hogg's orders. But they seemed to make no impression on the determined men who
                  marched up between their files and put the ballots in the box. </p>
               <p>Legree's ticket was buried beneath an avalanche. The new "Conservative" party
                  carried every county in the state save twelve and elected one hundred and six
                  members of the new legislature out of a total of one hundred and twenty. </p>
               <p>The next day hundreds of carpet-bagger thieves fled to tie North, and Legree led
                  the procession. <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0199" n="162"/>
               </p>
               <p>Legree had on deposit in New York two millions of dollars, and the total amount of
                  his part of the thefts he had engineered reached five millions. He opened an
                  office on Wall Street, bought a seat in the Stock Exchange, and became one of the
                  most daring and successful of a group of robbers who preyed on the industries of
                  the nation. </p>
               <p>The new Legislature appointed a Fraud Commission which uncovered the infamies of
                  the Legree r&eacute;gime, but every thief had escaped. They promptly impeached
                  the Governor and removed him from office, and the old commonwealth once more
                  lifted up her head and took her place in the ranks of civilised communities. </p>

               <p>Nelse was elated over the defeat and dissolution of the Leagues that had
                  persecuted him with such malignant hatred. When the news of the election came he
                  was still in bed suffering from his wounds. He had received an internal injury
                  that threatened to prove fatal. </p>
               <p>"Dar now!" he cried, sitting up in bed, "Ain't I done tole you no kinky-headed

                  his side. He died that afternoon at three o'clock. He regained consciousness
                  before the end and asked Eve for his banjo. </p>
               <p>He put it lovingly into the hands of Charlie Gaston who stood by the bed crying. </p>

               <p>Mrs. Durham, the Doctor wants you," said Charlie when McLeod's footfall had died
                  away. </p>
               <p>"Charlie, dear, why don't you call we 'Mama'&mdash;surely you love me a little
                  wee bit, don't you?" she asked, taking the boy's hand tenderly in hers. </p>
               <p>"Yes'm," he replied hanging his head. </p>
               <p>"Then do say Mama. You don't know how good it would be in my ears." </p>
               <p>"I try to but it chokes me," he half whispered, glancing timidly up at her. "Let
                  me call you Aunt Margaret, I always wanted an aunt and I think your name
                  Margaret's so sweet," he shyly added. </p>
               <p>She kissed him and said, "All right, if that's all you will give me." She passed
                  on into the library where the Preacher waited her. </p>
               <p>"My dear, I've just given young McLeod a piece of my mind. I wanted to say to you
                  that you are entirely mistaken in his character. He's a bad egg. I know all the
                  facts about his treachery. He's as smooth a liar as I've met in years." </p>
               <p>"With all his brute nature, there's some good in him," she persisted. </p>
               <p>"Well, it will stay in him. He will never let it get out." </p>
               <p>"All right, have your way about it for the time. We'll <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0214" n="177"/> see who is right in the long run. Now
                  I've a move pressing and tougher problem for your solution." </p>
               <p>"What is it?" </p>
               <p>"Dick." </p>
               <p>"What's he done this time?" </p>
               <p>"He steals everything he can get his hands on." </p>
               <p>"He is a puzzle." </p>
               <p>"He's the greatest liar I ever saw," she continued. "He simply will not tell the
                  truth if he can think up a lie in time. I'd say run him off the place, but for
                  Charlie. He seems to love the little scoundrel. I'm afraid his influence over
                  Charlie will be vicious, but it would break the child's heart to drive him away.
                  What shall we do with him?" </p>
               <p>The Preacher laughed. "I give it up, my dear, you've got beyond my depth now. I
                  don't know whether he's got a soul. Certainly the very rudimentary foundations of
                  morals seem lacking. I believe you could take a young ape and teach him quicker. I
                  leave him with you. At present it's a domestic problem." </p>
               <p>"Thanks, that's so encouraging." </p>
               <p>Dick was a puzzle and no mistake about it. But to Charlie his rolling mischievous
                  eyes, his cunning fingers and his wayward imagination were unfailing mountains of
                  life. He found every bird's nest within two miles of town. He could track a rabbit
                  almost as swiftly and surely as a hound. He could work like fury when he had a
                  mind to, and loaf a half day over one row of the garden when he didn't want to
                  work, which was his chronic condition. </p>
               <p>When the revival season set in for the negroes in the summer, the days of sorrow
                  began for householders. Every negro in the county became absolutely worthless and
                  remained so until the emotional insanity attending their meetings wore off. <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0215" n="178"/>
               </p>
               <p>Aunt Mary, Mrs. Durham's cook, got salvation over again every summer with
                  increasing power and increasing degeneration in her work. Some nights she got home
                  at two o'clock and breakfast was not ready until nine. Some nights she didn't get
                  home at all, and Mrs. Durham had to get breakfast herself. </p>
               <p>It was a hard time for Dick who had not yet experienced religion, and on whom fell
                  the brunt of the extra work and Mrs. Durham's fretfulness besides. </p>
               <p>"I tell you what less do, Charlie!" he cried one day. "Less go down ter dat nigger
                  chu'ch, en bus' up de meetin'! I'se gettin' tired er dis." </p>
               <p>"How'll you do it?" </p>
               <p>"I show you somefin'?" He reached under his shirt next to his skin, and pulled out
                  Dr. Graham's sun glass. </p>
               <p>"Where'd you get that, Dick?" </p>
               <p>"Foun' it whar er man lef' it." He walled his eyes solemnly. </p>
               <p>"Des watch here when I turns 'im in de sun. I kin set dat pile er straw er fire
                  wid it!" </p>
               <p>"You mustn't set the church afire!" warned Charlie. </p>
               <p>"Now, chile, but I git up in de gallery, en when ole Uncle Josh gins ter holler en
                  bawl en r'ar en charge, I fling dat blaze er light right on his bal' haid, en I
                  set him afire sho's you bawn!" </p>
               <p>"Dick, I wouldn't do, it," said Charlie, laughing in spite of himself. </p>
               <p>Charlie refused to accompany him. But Dick's mind was set on the necessity of this
                  work of reform. So in the afternoon he slipped off without leave and quietly made
                  his way into the gallery of the Negro Baptist church. </p>
               <p>The excitement was running high. Uncle Josh had preached one sermon an hour in
                  length, and had called up the mourners. At least fifty had come forward. The <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0216" n="179"/> benches had been cleared for five rows
                  back from the pulpit to give plenty of room for the mourners to crawl over the
                  floor, walk back and forth and shout when they "came through," and for their
                  friends to fan them. </p>
               <p>This open place was covered with wheat straw to keep the mourners off the bare
                  floor, and afford some sort of comfort for those far advanced in mourning, who
                  went into trances and sometimes lay motionless for hours on their backs or flat on
                  their faces. </p>
               <p>The mourners had kicked and shuffled this straw out to the edges and the floor was
                  bare. Uncle Josh had sent two deacons out for more straw. </p>
               <p>In the meantime he was working himself up to another mighty climax of exhortation
                  to move sinners to come forward. </p>
               <p>"Come on ter glory you po, po sinners, en flee ter de Lamb er God befo de flames
                  er hell swaller you whole! At de last great day de Sperit 'll flash de light er
                  his shinin' face on dis ole parch up sinful worl', en hit 'll ketch er fire in er
                  minute, an de yearth 'll melt wid furvient heat! Whar 'll you be when den po
                  tremblin' sinner? Whar 'll you be when de flame er de Sperit de smites de moon and
                  de stars wid fire, en dey gin ter drap outten de sky en knock big holes in de

                  his face in de black smoke dat rise fum de pit?" </p>
               <p>Moans and groans and shrieks, louder and louder filled the air. Uncle Josh paused
                  a moment and looked for his deacons with the straw. They were just coming up the
                  steps with a great armful over their heads. </p>
               <p>"What's de mattter wid you breddern! Fetch on dat wheat straw! Here's dese
                  tremblin' souls gwine down inter de dames er hell des fur de lak er wheat straw!" </p>
               <p>The brethren hurried forward with the wheat straw, and just as they reached Uncle
                  Josh standing perspiring <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0217" n="180"/> in the midst
                  of his groaning mourners, Dick flashed from the gallery a stream of dazzling light
                  on the old man's face and held it steadily on his bald head. Josh was too
                  astonished to move at first. He was simply paralysed with fear. It was all right
                  to talk about the flame of the Spirit, but he wasn't exactly ready to run into it.
                  Suddenly he clapped his hands on the top of his head and sprang straight up in the
                  air yelling in a plain everyday profane voice, </p>
               <p>"God-der-mighty! What's dat?" </p>
               <p>The brethren holding the straw saw it and stood dumb with terror. The light
                  disappeared from Uncle Josh's head and lit the straw in splendour on one of the
                  deacon's shoulders. Aunt Mary's voice was heard above the mourners' din, clear,
                  shrill and soul piercing. </p>
               <p>"G-l-o-r-y! G-1-o-r-y ter God! De flame er de Sperit! De judgment day! Yas Lawd,
                  I'se here! Glory! Halleluyah!" </p>
               <p>Suddenly the straw an the deacon's back burst into flames! And pandemonium broke
                  loose. A weak-minded sinner screamed, </p>
               <p>"De flames er Hell!" </p>
               <p>The mourners smelled the smoke and sprang from the door with white staring eyes.
                  When they saw the fire and got their bearings they made for the
                  open,&mdash;they jumped on each others' back and made for the door like
                  madmen. Those nearest the windows sprang through, and when the lower part of the
                  window was jammed, big buck negroes jumped on the backs of the lower crowd and
                  plunged through the two upper sashes with a crash that added new terror to the
                  panic. </p>
               <p>In two minutes the church was empty, and the yard full of crazy, shouting negroes. </p>
               <p>Dick stepped from the gallery into the crowd as the last ones emerged, ran up to
                  the pulpit and <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0218" n="181"/> stamped out the fire in
                  the straw with his bare feet. He looked around to see if they had left anything
                  valuable behind in the stampede, and sauntered leisurely out of the church. </p>
               <p>"Now dog-gone 'em let 'em yell!" he muttered to himself. </p>
               <p>When Uncle Josh sufficiently recovered his senses to think, and saw the church
                  still standing, with not even a whiff of smoke to be seen, instead of the roaring
                  furnace he had expected, he was amazed. He called his scattered deacons together
                  and they went cautiously back to investigate. </p>
               <p>"Hit's no use in talkin' Bre'r Josh, dey sho wuz er fire!" cried one of the
                  deacons. </p>
               <p>"Sho's de Lawd's in heaben. I feel it gittin' on my fingers fo' I drap dat straw!"
                  said another. </p>
               <p>"Hit smite me fust right top er my haid!" whispered Uncle Josh in awe. </p>
               <p>They cautiously approached the pulpit and there in front of it lay the charred
                  fragments of the burned straw pile. </p>
               <p>They gathered around it in awe-struck wonder. One of them touched it with his
                  foot. </p>
               <p>"Doan do dat!" cried Uncle Josh, lifting his hand with authority. </p>
               <p>They drew back, Uncle Josh saw the immense power in that heap of charred straw.
                  Some of it was a little damp and it had been only partly burned. </p>
               <p>"Dar's de mericle er de Sperit!" he solemnly declared. </p>
               <p>"Yas Lawd!" echoed a deacon. </p>
               <p>"Fetch de hammer, en de saw, a de nails; an de boards en build right dar en altar
                  ter de Sperit!" were his prophetic commands. </p>
               <p>And they did. They got an old show case of glass, <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0219"
                     n="182"/> put the charred straw in it, and built an open box work around it
                  just where it fell in front of the pulpit. </p>
               <p>Then a revival broke out that completely paralysed the industries of Campbell
                  county. Every negro stopped work and went to that church. Uncle Josh didn't have
                  to preach or to plead. They come in troops towards the magic altar, whose fame and
                  mystery had thrilled every superstitious soul with its power. The benches were all
                  moved out and the whole church floor given up to mourners. Uncle Josh had an easy
                  time walking around just adding a few terrifying hints to trembling sinners, or
                  helping to hold some strong sister when she had "come through," with so much glory
                  in her bones that there was danger she would hurt somebody. </p>
               <p>After a week the matter became so serious the white people set in motion an
                  investigation of the affair. Dick had thrown out a mysterious hint that he knew
                  some things that were very funny. </p>
               <p>"Doan you tell nobody!" he would solemnly say to Charlie. </p>
               <p>And then he would lie down on the grass and roll and laugh. At length by dint of
                  perseverance, and a bribe of a quarter, the Preacher induced Dick to explain the
                  mystery. He did, and it broke up the meeting. </p>
               <p>Uncle Josh's fury knew no bounds. He was heart-broken at the sudden collapse of
                  his revival, chagrined at the recollection of his own terror at the fire, and
                  fearful of an avalanche of backsliders from the meeting among those who had
                  professed even with the greatest glory. </p>
               <p>He demanded that the Preacher should turn Dick over to him for correction. The
                  Preacher took a few hours to consider whether he should whip him himself or turn
                  him over to Uncle Josh. Dick heard Uncle Josh's demand. Out behind the stable he
                  and Charlie held a council of war. <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0220" n="183"/>
               </p>
               <p>"You go see Miss Mar'get fur me, en git up close to her, en tell her taint right
                  ter 'low no low down black nigger ter whip me!" </p>
               <p>"All right Dick, I will," agreed Charlie. </p>
               <p>"Case ef ole Josh beats me I gwine ter run away. I nebber git ober dat." </p>
               <p>Dick had threatened to run away often before when he wanted to force Charlie to do
                  something for him. Once he had gone a mile out of town with his clothes tied in a
                  bundle, and Charlie trudging after him begging him not to leave. </p>
               <p>The boy did his best to save Dick the humiliation of a whipping at the hands of
                  Uncle Josh, but in vain. </p>
               <p>When Uncle Josh led him out to the stable lot, his face was not pleasant to look
                  upon. There was a dangerous gleam in Dick's eye that boded no good to his enemy. </p>
               <p>"You imp er de debbil!" exclaimed Uncle Josh shaking his switch with unction. </p>
               <p>"I fool you good enough, you ole bal' headed ape!" answered Dick gritting his
                  teeth defiantly. </p>
               <p>"I make you sing enudder chune fo I'se done wid you." </p>
               <p>"En if you does, nigger, you know what I gwine do fur you?" cried Dick rolling his
                  eyes up at his enemy. </p>
               <p>"What kin you do, honey?" asked Uncle Josh, humouring his victim with the evident
                  relish of a cat before his meal on a mouse. </p>
               <p>"Ef you hits me hard, I gwine ter burn you house down on you haid some night, en
                  run erway des es sho es I kin stick er match to it," said Dick. </p>
               <p>"You is, is you?" thundered Josh with wrath. </p>
               <p>"Dat I is. En I burn yo ole chu'ch de same night." </p>
               <p>Uncle Josh was silent a moment. Dick's words had chilled his heart. He was afraid
                  of him, but he was <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0221" n="184"/> afraid to back down
                  from what was now evidently his duty. So without further words he whipped him. Yet
                  to save his life he could not hit him as hard as he thought he deserved. </p>
               <p>That night Dick disappeared from Hambright, and for weeks every evening at dusk
                  the wistful face of Charlie Gaston could be seen on the big hill to the south of
                  town vainly watching for somebody. He would always take something to eat in his
                  pockets, and when he gave up his vigil he would place the food under a big
                  shelving rock where they had often played together. But the birds and ground
                  squirrels ate it. He would slip back the next day hoping to see Dick jump out of
                  the cave and surprise him. </p>
               <p>And then at last he gave it up, sat down under the rock and cried. He knew Dick
                  would grow to be a man somewhere out in the big world and never come back. </p>

               <p>Hambright had changed but little in the eighteen years of peace that had followed
                  the terrors of Legree's r&eacute;gime. The population had doubled, though but
                  few houses had been built. The town had not grown from the development of
                  industry, but for a very simple reason&mdash;the country people had moved into
                  the town, seeking refuge from a new terror that was growing of late more and more
                  a menace to a country home, the roving criminal negro. </p>
               <p>The birth of a girl baby was sure to make a father restless, and when the baby
                  looked up into his face one day with the soft light of a maiden, he gave up his
                  farm and moved to town. </p>
               <p>The most important development of these eighteen years was the complete alienation
                  of the white and black races as compared with the old familiar trust of domestic
                  life. </p>
               <p>When Legree finished his work as the master artificer of the Reconstruction
                  Policy, he had dug a gulf between the races as deep as hell. It had never been
                  bridged. The deed was done and it had crystallised into the solid rock that lies
                  at the basis of society. It was done at a formative period, and it could no more
                  be undone now than you could roll the universe back in its course. </p>
               <p>The younger generation of white men only knew the Negro as an enemy of his people
                  in politics and society. <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0238" n="201"/> He never came
                  in contact with him except in menial service, in which the service rendered was
                  becoming more and more trifling, and his habits more insolent. He had his separate
                  schools, churches, preachers and teachers and his political leaders were the
                  beneficiaries of Legree's legacies. </p>
               <p>With the Anglo-Saxon race guarding the door of marriage with fire and sword, the
                  effort was being made to build a nation inside a nation of two antagonistic rices.
                  No such thing had ever been done in the history of the human race, even under the
                  development of the monarchial and aristocratic forms of society. How could it be
                  done under the formulas of Democracy with Equality as the fundamental basis of
                  law? And yet this was the programme of the age. </p>
               <p>Gaston was feeling blue from the reaction which followed his temptation by McLeod.
                  His duty was clear the night before as he walked firmly homeward, recalling the
                  tragedy of the past. Now in the cold light of day, the past seemed for away and
                  unreal. The present was near, pressing, vital. He laid down a book he was trying
                  to read, locked his office and strolled down town to see Tom Camp. </p>
               <p>The old soldier had come to be a sort oracle to him. His affection for the son of
                  his Colonel was deep and abiding, and his extravagant flattery of his talents and
                  future were so evidently sincere they always acted as a tonic. And he needed a
                  tonic to-day. </p>
               <p>Tom was seated in a chair in his yard under a big cedar, working on a basket, and
                  a little golden-haired girl was playing at his feet. It was his old home he had
                  lost in Legree's day, but had got back through the help of General Worth, who came
                  up one day and paid back Tom's gift of lightwood in gleaming yellow metal. His
                  long hair and full beard were white now, and his eyes <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0239" n="202"/> had a soft deep look that told of
                  sorrows borne in patience and faith beyond the ken of the younger man. It was this
                  look on Tom's face that held Gaston like a magnet when he was in trouble. </p>
               <p>"Tom, I'm blue and heartsick. I've come down to have you cheer me up a little." </p>
               <p>"You've got the blues? Well that is a joke!" cried Tom. "You, young and handsome,
                  the best educated man in the county, the finest orator in the state, life all
                  before you, and God fillin' the world to-day with sunshine and spring flowers, and
                  all for you! You blue! That is a joke." And Tom's voice rang in hearty laughter. </p>
               <p>"Come here, Flora, and kiss me, you won't laugh at me, will you?" </p>
               <p>The child climbed up into his lap, slipped her little arms around his neck and
                  hugged and him. </p>
               <p>"Now, once more, dearie, long and close and hard&mdash;oh! That's worth a
                  pound of candy!" Again she squeezed his neck and kissed him, looking into his face
                  with a smile. </p>
               <p>"I love you, Charlie," she said with quiet seriousness. </p>
               <p>"Do you, dear? Well, that makes me glad. If I can win the love of as pretty a
                  little girl as you I'm not a failure, am I?" And he smoothed her curls. </p>
               <p>"Ain't she sweet?" cried Tom with pride as he laid aside his basket and looked at
                  her with moistened eyes. </p>
               <p>"Tom, she's the sweetest child I ever saw." </p>
               <p>"Yes, she's God's last and best gift to me, to show me He still loved me. Talk
                  about trouble. Man, you're a baby. You ain't cut your teeth yet. Wait till you've
                  seen some things I've am. Wait till you've seen the light of the world go out, and
                  staggerin' in the <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0240" n="203"/> dark met the devil
                  face to face, and looked him in the eye, and smelled the pit. And then feel him
                  knock you down in it, and the red waves roll over you and smother you. I've been
                  there." </p>
               <p>Tom paused and looked at Gaston. "You weren't here when I come to the end of the
                  world, the time when that baby was born, and Annie died with the little red bundle
                  sleepin' on her breast. The oldest girl was murdered by Legree's nigger soldiers.
                  Then Annie give me that little gal. Lord, I was the happiest old fool that ever
                  lived that day! And then when I looked into Annie's dead face, I went down, down,
                  down! But I looked up from the bottom of the pit and I saw the light of them blue
                  eyes and I heard her callin' me to take her. How I watched her and nursed her, a
                  mother and a father to her, day and night, through the long years, and how them
                  little fingers of hers got hold of my heart! Now, I bless the Lord for all His
                  goodness and mercy to me. She will make it all right. She's going to be a lady and
                  such a beauty! She's goin' to school now, and me and the General's goin' to take
                  her ter college bye and bye, and she's goin' to marry some big handsome fellow
                  like you, and her crippled grey haired daddy'll live in her house in his old age.
                  The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want." </p>
               <p>"Tom, you make me ashamed." </p>
               <p>"You ought to be, man, a youngster like you to talk about gettin' the blues.
                  What's all your education for?" </p>
               <p>"Sometimes I think that only men like you have ever been educated." </p>
               <p>"G'long with your foolishness, boy. I ain't never had a show in this world. The
                  nigger's been on my back since I first toddled into the world, and I reckon he'll
                  ride me into the grave. They are my only rivals now making them baskets and they
                  always undersell me." <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0241" n="204"/>
               </p>
               <p>Gaston started as Tom uttered the last sentence. </p>
               <p>"With you, boy, it's all plain sailin'. You're the best looking chap in the
                  county. I was a dandy when I was young. It does me good to look at you if you
                  don't care nothin' about fine clothes. Then you're as sharp as a razor. There
                  ain't a man in No'th Caliny that can stand up agin you on the stump. I've heard
                  'em all. You'll be the Governor of this state. </p>
               <p>That was always the climax of Tom's prophetic flattery. He could think of no
                  grander end of a human life than to crown it in the Governor's Palace of North
                  Carolina. He belonged to the old days when it was a bigger thing to be the
                  Governor of a great state than to hold any office short of the
                  Presidency,&mdash;when men resigned seats in the United States Senate to run
                  for Governor, and when the national government was so puny a thing that the
                  bankers of Europe refused to loan money on United States bonds unless
                  countersigned by the State of Virginia. And that was not so long ago. The bankers
                  sent that answer to Buchanan's Secretary of the Treasury. </p>
               <p>"Tom, you've lifted me out of the dumps. I owe you a doctor's fee," cried Gaston
                  with enthusiasm as he placed Flora back on the grass and started to his office. </p>
               <p>"All I charge you is to come again. The old man's proud of his young friend. You
                  make me feel like I'm somebody in the old world after all. And some day when
                  you're great and rich and famous and the world's full of your name, I'll tell
                  folks I know you like my own boy, and I'll brag about how many times you used to
                  come to see me." </p>
               <p>"Hush, Tom, you make me feel silly," said Gaston as he warmly pressed the old
                  fellow's hand. He went back toward his office with lighter step and more buoyant
                  heart. His mind was as clear as the noonday sun that was now flooding the green
                  fresh world with its splendour. He <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0242" n="205"/>
                  would stand by his own people. He would sink or swim with them. If poverty and
                  failure were the result, let it be so. If success came, all the better. There were
                  things more to be desired than gold. </p>

               <head> CHAPTER X<lb/> THE HEART OF A VILLAIN </head>

               <p>McLeod had developed into a man of undoubted power. He was but thirty-two years
                  old, dictator of his party in the state. </p>
               <p>He had the fighting temperament which Southern people demand in their leaders.
                  With this temperament he combined the skill of subtle diplomatic tact. He had no
                  moral scruples of any kind. The problem of expediency alone interested him in
                  ethics. </p>
               <p>McLeod's pet aversion was a preacher, especially a Baptist or a Methodist. His
                  choicest oaths he reserved for them. He made a study of their weaknesses, and
                  could tell dozens of stories to their discredit, many of them true. He had an
                  instinct for finding their weak spots and holding them up to ridicule. He bought
                  every book of militant infidelity he could find and memorised the bitterest of it.
                  He took special pride in scoffing at religion before the young converts of
                  Durham's church. </p>
               <p>He was endowed with a personal magnetism that fascinated the young as the hiss of
                  a snake holds a bird. His serious work was politics and sensualism. In politics he
                  was at his best. Here he was cunning, plausible, careful, brilliant and daring. He
                  never lost his head in defeat or victory. He never forgot a friend, or forgave an
                  enemy. Of his foe he asked no quarter and gave none. <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0296" n="257"/>
               </p>
               <p>His ambitions were purely selfish. He meant to climb to the top. As to the means,
                  the end would justify them. He preferred to associate with white people. But when
                  it was necessary to win a negro, he never hesitated to go any length. The centre
                  of the universe to his mind was A. McLeod. </p>
               <p>He was fond of saying to a crowd of youngsters whom he taught to play poker and
                  drink whiskey, </p>
               <p>"Boys, I know the world. The great man is the man who gets there." </p>
               <p>He was generous with his money, and the boys called him a jolly good fellow. He
                  used to say in explanation of this careless habit, </p>
               <p>"It won't do for an ordinary man to throw away money as I do. I play for big
                  stakes. I'm not a spendthrift. I'm simply sowing seed. I can wait for the
                  harvest." </p>
               <p>And when they would admire this overmuch he would warn them, </p>
               <p>"As a rule my advice is, Get money. Get it fairly and squarely if you can, but
                  whatever you do,&mdash; get it. When you come right down to it, money's your
                  first, last, best and only friend. Others promise well but when the scratch comes,
                  they fail. Money never fails." </p>
               <p>A boy of fifteen asked him one day when he was mellow with liquor, </p>
               <p>"McLeod, which would you rather be, President of the United States or a big
                  millionaire?" </p>
               <p>"Boys," he replied, smacking his lips, and running his tongue around his cheeks
                  inside and softly caressing them with one hand, while he half closed his eyes, </p>
               <p>"They say old Simon Legree is worth fifty millions of dollars, and that his actual
                  income is twenty per cent on that. They say he stole most of it, and that every
                  dollar represents a broken life, and every cent of it could be painted red with
                  the blood of his victims. Even so, I <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0297" n="258"/>
                  would rather be in Legree's shoes and have those millions a year than to be
                  Almighty God with hosts of angels singing psalms to me through all eternity." </p>
               <p>And the shallow-pated satellites cheered this blasphemy with open-eyed wonder. </p>
               <p>The weakest side of his nature was that turned toward women. He was vain as a
                  peacock, and the darling wish of his soul was to be a successful libertine. This
                  was the secret of the cruelty back of his desire of boundless wealth. </p>
               <p>He had the intellectual forehead of his Scotch father, large, handsomely modelled
                  features, nostrils that dilated and contracted widely, and the thick sensuous lips
                  of his mother. His eyebrows were straight, thick and suggested undoubted force of
                  intellect. His hair was a deep red, thick and coarse, but his moustache was finer
                  and it was his special pride to point its delicately curved tips. </p>
               <p>His vanity was being stimulated just now by two opposite forces. He was in love,
                  as deeply as such a nature could love, with Sallie Worth. Her continued rejection
                  of his suit had wounded his vanity, but had roused all pugnacity of his nature to
                  strengthen this apparent weakness. </p>
               <p>He had discovered recently that he exercised a potent influence over Mrs. Durham.
                  The moment he was repulsed, his vanity turned for renewed strength toward her. He
                  saw instantly the immense power even the slightest indiscretion on her part would
                  give him over the Preacher's life. He knew that while he was not a demonstrative
                  man, he loved his wife with intense devotion. He knew, too, that here was the
                  Preacher's weakest spot. In his tireless devotion to his work, he had starved his
                  wife's heart. He had noticed that she always called him "Dr. Durham" now, and that
                  he had gradually fallen into the habit of calling her "Mrs. Durham." <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0298" n="259"/>
               </p>
               <p>This had been fixed in their habits, perhaps by the change from housekeeping to
                  living at the hotel. Since old Aunt Mary's death, Mrs. Durham had given up her
                  struggle with the modern negro servants, closed her house, and they had boarded
                  for several years. </p>
               <p>He saw that if he could entangle her name with his in the dirty gossip of village
                  society, he could strike his enemy a mortal blow. He knew that she had grown more
                  and more jealous of the crowds of silly women that always dog the heels of a
                  powerful minister with flattery and open admiration. He determined to make the
                  experiment. </p>
               <p>Mrs. Durham, while nine years his senior, did not look a day over thirty. Her face
                  was as smooth and soft and round as a girl's, her figure as straight and full, and
                  her every movement instinct with stored vital powers that had never been drawn
                  upon. </p>
               <p>She was in a dangerous period of her mental development. She had been bitterly
                  disappointed in life. Her loss of slaves and the ancestral prestige of great
                  wealth had sent the steel shaft of a poisoned dagger into her soul. She was
                  unreconciled to it. While she was passing through the anarchy of Legree's
                  r&eacute;gime which followed the war, her unsatisfied maternal instincts
                  absorbed her in the work of relieving the poor and the broken. But when the white
                  race rose in its might and shook off this nightmare and order and a measure of
                  prosperity had come, she had fallen back into brooding pessimism. </p>
               <p>She had reached the hour of that soul crisis when she felt life would almost in a
                  moment slip from her grasp, and she asked herself the question, "Have I lived?"
                  And she could not answer. </p>
               <p>She found herself asking the reason for things long accepted as fixed and eternal.
                  What was good right and eternal? What was good, right, truth? And what made it
                  good, right, or true? <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0299" n="260"/>
               </p>
               <p>And she beat the wings of her proud woman's head against the bars that held her,
                  until tired, and bleeding she was exhausted but unconquered. </p>
               <p>She was furious with McLeod for his open association with negro politicians. </p>
               <p>"Allan, in my soul, I am ashamed for you when I see you thus degrade your
                  manhood." </p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Mrs. Durham," he replied, "the most beautiful flower grows in dirt, but
                  the flower is not dirt." </p>
               <p>"Well, I knew you were vain, but that caps the climax!" </p>
               <p>"Isn't my figure true, whether you say I'm dog-fennel or a pink?" </p>
               <p>"No, you are not a flower. Will is the soul of man. The flower is ruled by laws
                  outside itself. A man's will is creative. You can make law. You can walk with your
                  head among the stars, and you choose to crawl in a ditch. I am out of patience
                  with you." </p>
               <p>"But only for a purpose. You must judge by the end in view." </p>
               <p>"There's no need to stoop so low." </p>
               <p>"I assure you it is absolutely necessary to my aims in life. And they are high
                  enough. I appreciate your interest in me, more than I dare to tell you. You have
                  always been kind to me since I was a wild red-headed brute of a boy. And you have
                  always been my supreme inspiration in work. While others have cursed and scoffed
                  you smiled at me and your smile has warmed my heart in its blackest nights." </p>
               <p>She looked at him with a mother-like tenderness. </p>
               <p>"What ends could be high enough to justify such methods ?" </p>
               <p>"I hate poverty and squalour. It's been my fate. I've sworn to climb out of it, if
                  I have to fight or buy my <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0300" n="261"/> way through
                  hell to do it. I dream of a palatial home, of soft white beds, grand banquet
                  halls, and music and wine, and the faces of those I love near me. Besides, the
                  work I am doing is the best for the state and the nation." </p>
               <p>"But how can you walk arm in arm with a big black negro, as they say you do, to
                  get his vote?" </p>
               <p>"Simply because they represent 120,000 votes I need. You can't tell their colour
                  when they get in the box. I use these fools as so many worms. My political creed
                  is for public consumption only. I never allow anybody to impose on me. I don't
                  allow even Allan McLeod to deceive me with a proper platform, or a lot of
                  articulated wind. I'm not a preacher." </p>
               <p>She winced at that shot, blushed and looked at him curiously for a moment. </p>
               <p>"No, you are not a preacher. I wish you were a better man." </p>
               <p>"So do I, when I am with you," he answered in a low serious voice. </p>
               <p>"But I can't get over the sense of personal degradation involved in your
                  association with negroes as your equal," she persisted. </p>
               <p>"The trouble is you're an unreconstructed rebel. Women never really forgive a
                  social wrong." </p>
               <p>"I am unreconstructed," she snapped with pride. </p>
               <p>"And you thank God daily for it, don't you?" </p>
               <p>"Yes, I do. Human nature can't be reconstructed by the fiat of fools who tinker
                  with laws," she cried. </p>
               <p>These thousands of black votes are here. They've got to be controlled. I'm doing
                  the job." </p>
               <p>"You don't try to get rid of them." </p>
               <p>"Get rid of them? Ye gods, that would be a task! The Negro is the sentimental pet
                  of the nation. Put him on a continent alone, and he will sink like an iron <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0301" n="262"/> wedge to the bottomless pit of
                  barbarism. But he is the ward of the Republic&mdash;our only orphan, chronic,
                  incapable. That wardship is a grip of steel on the throat of the South. Back of it
                  is an ocean of maudlin sentimental fools. I am simply making the most of the
                  situation. I didn't make it to order. I'm just doing the best I can with the
                  material in hand." </p>
               <p>"Why don't you come out like a man and defy this horde of fools?" </p>
               <p>"Martyrdom has become too cheap. The preachers have a hundred thousand
                  missionaries now we are trying to support." </p>
               <p>"Allan, I thought you held below the rough surface of your nature high
                  ideals,&mdash;you don't mean this." </p>
               <p>"What could one man do against these millions?" </p>
               <p>"Do!" she cried, her face ablaze. The history of the world is made up of the
                  individuality of a few men. A little Yankee woman wrote a crude book. The single
                  act of that woman's will caused the war, killed a million men, desolated and
                  ruined the South, and changed the history of the world. The single dauntless
                  personality of George Washington three times saved the colonies from surrender and
                  created the Republic. I am surprised to hear a man of your brain and reading talk
                  like that!" </p>
               <p>"When I am with you and hear your voice I have heroic impulses. You are the only
                  human being with whom I would take the time to discuss this question. But the
                  current is too strong. The other way is easier, and it serves my ends better.
                  Besides, I am not sure it isn't better from every point of view. We've got the
                  Negro here, and must educate him." </p>
               <p>"Hush! Tell that to somebody that hates you, not to me," she cried. </p>
               <p>"Don't you think we must educate them?" </p>
               <p>"No, I think it is a crime." <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0302" n="263"/>
               </p>
               <p>"Would you leave them in ignorance, a threat to society ?" </p>
               <p>"Yes, until they can be moved. When I see these young negro men and women coming
                  out of their schools and colleges well dressed, with their shallow veneer of an
                  imitation culture, I feel like crying over the farce." </p>
               <p>"Surely, Mrs. Durham, you believe they are better fitted for life? </p>
               <p>"They are not. They are lifted out of their only possible sphere of menial
                  service, and denied any career. It is simply inhuman. They are led to certain
                  slaughter of soul and body at last. It is a horrible tragedy!" </p>
               <p>Allan looked at her, smiled, and replied, "I knew you were a bitter and brilliant
                  woman but I didn't think you would go to such lengths even with your pet
                  aversions." </p>
               <p>"It's not an aversion, or a prejudice, sir. It's a simple fact of history.
                  Education increases the power of the brain to think and the heart to suffer.
                  Sooner or later these educated negroes feel the clutch of the iron hand of the
                  white man's unwritten laws on their throat. They have their choice between a
                  suicide's grave or a prison cell. And the numbers who dare the grave and the
                  prison cell daily increase. The South is kinder to the Negro when he is kept in
                  his place." </p>
               <p>"You are a quarter of a century behind the times." </p>
               <p>"Am I so old?" she laughed. </p>
               <p>"The sentiment, not the woman. You are the most beautiful woman I ever saw." </p>
               <p>"I like all my boys to feel that way about me." </p>
               <p>"You don't class me quite with the rest, do you?" </p>
               <p>She blushed the slightest bit. "'No, I've always taken a peculiar interest in you.
                  I have quarrelled with everybody who has hated and spoken evil of you. I have
                  always believed you were capable of a high and noble life of great achievement."
                     <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0303" n="264"/>
               </p>
               <p>"And your faith in me has been my highest incentive to give the lie to my enemies
                  and succeed. And I will. I will be the master of this state within two years. And
                  I want you to remember that I lay it all at your feet. The world need not know
                  it,&mdash;you know it." He spoke with intense earnestness. </p>
               <p>"But I don't want you to make such a success at the price of Negro equality. I
                  feel a sense of unspeakable degradation for you when I hear your name hissed. At
                  least I was your teacher once. Come Allan, give up Negro politics and devote
                  yourself to an honourable career in law!" </p>
               <p> He shook his head with calm persistence. </p>
               <p>"No, this is my calling." </p>
               <p>"Then take a nobler one." </p>
               <p>"To succeed grandly is the only title to nobility here." </p>
               <p>"Is the Doctor on speaking terms with you now?" </p>
               <p>"Oh! yes, I joke him about his hide-bound Bourbonism, and he tells me I am all
                  sorts of a villain. But we have made an agreement to hate one another in a polite
                  sort of way as becomes a teacher in Israel and a statesman with responsibilities.
                  By the way, I saw him driving to the Springs with a bevy of pretty girls a few
                  hours ago." </p>
               <p>"Indeed, I didn't know it!" </p>
               <p>"Yes, he seemed to be having a royal time and to have renewed his youth." </p>
               <p>An angry flush came to her face and she made no reply. McLeod glanced at her
                  furtively and smiled at this evidence that his shot had gone home. </p>
               <p>"Would you drive with me to the Springs? We will get there before this party
                  starts back." She hesitated, and answered, "yes." </p>

               <head> CHAPTER XVIII<lb/> THE WAYS OF BOSTON </head>

               <p>When Helen Lowell reached Boston from her visit with Sallie Worth, she found her
                  father in the midst of his political campaign. The Hon. Everett Lowell was the
                  representative of Congress from the Boston Highlands district. His home was an old
                  fashioned white Colonial house built during the American Revolution. </p>
               <p>He was not a man of great wealth, but well-to-do, a successful politician,
                  enthusiastic student, a graduate of Harvard, and he had always made a specialty of
                  championing the cause of the "freedmen." He was a chronic proposer of a military
                  force bill for the South. </p>
               <p>His family was one of the proudest in America. He had a family tree five hundred
                  years old&mdash;an unbroken line of unconquerable men who held liberty dearer
                  than life. He believed in the heritage of good honest blood as he believed in
                  blooded horses. His home was furnished in perfect taste, with beautiful old
                  rosewood and mahogany stuff that had both character and history. On the walls hung
                  the stately portraits of his ancestors representative of three hundred years of
                  American life. He never confused his political theories about the abstract rights
                  of the African with his personal choice of associates or his pride in his
                  Anglo-Saxon blood. With him politics was one thing, society another. </p>
               <p>His pet hobby, which combined in one his philanthropic <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0352" n="311"/> ideals and his practical politics, was
                  of late a patronage he had extended to young George Harris, the bright mulatto son
                  of Eliza and George Harris whose dramatic slave history had made their son famous
                  at Harvard. </p>
               <p>This young negro was a speaker of fair ability and was accompanying Lowell on his
                  campaign tours of the district, making speeches for his patron, who had obtained
                  for him a clerk's position in the United States Custom House. Harris was quite a
                  drawing card at these meetings. He had a natural aptitude for politics; modest,
                  affable handsome, and almost white, he was a fine argument in himself to support
                  Lowell's political theories, who used him for all he was worth as he had at the
                  previous election. </p>
               <p>Harris had become a familiar figure at Lowell's home in the spacious library,
                  where he had the free use of the books, and frequently he dined with the family,
                  when there at dinner time hard at work on some political speech or some study for
                  a piece of music. </p>
               <p>Lowell had met his daughter at the depot behind his pair of Kentucky
                  thoroughbreds. This daughter, his only child, was his pride and joy. She was a
                  blonde beauty, and her resemblance to her father was remarkable. He was a widower,
                  and this lovely girl, at once the incarnation of his lost love and so fair a
                  reflection of his being, had ruled him with absolute sway during the past few
                  years. </p>
               <p>He was laughing like a boy at her coming. </p>
               <p>"Oh! My beauty, the sight of your face gives me new life!" he cried smiling with
                  love and admiration. </p>
               <p>"You mustn't try to spoil me!" she laughed. </p>
               <p>"Did you really have a good time in Dixie?" he whispered. </p>
               <p>"Oh! Papa, such a time!" she exclaimed shutting her eyes as though she were trying
                  to live it over again. <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0353" n="312"/>
               </p>
               <p>"Really?" </p>
               <p>"Beaux, morning, noon and night,&mdash;dancing, moonlight rides, boats gliding
                  along the beautiful river and mocking birds singing softly their love-song under
                  the window all night!" </p>
               <p>"Well you did have romance," he declared. </p>
               <p>"Yes," she went on "and such people, such hospitality&mdash;oh! I feel as
                  though I never had lived before." </p>
               <p>"My dear, you mustn't desert us all like that," he protested. </p>
               <p>"I can't help it, I'm a rebel now." </p>
               <p>"Then keep still till the campaign's over!" he warned in mock fear. </p>
               <p>"And the boys down there," she continued, "they are such boys! Time doesn't seem
                  to be an object with them at all. Evidently they have never heard of our uplifting
                  Yankee motto 'Time is money.' And such knightly deference! such charming old
                  fashioned chivalrous ways!" </p>
               <p>"But, dear, isn't that a little out of date?" </p>
               <p>"How staid and proper and busy Boston seems! I know I am going to be depressed by
                  it." </p>
               <p>"I know what's the matter with you!" he whistled. </p>
               <p>"What?" she slyly asked. </p>
               <p>"One of those boys." </p>
               <p>"I confess, Papa, he's as handsome as a prince." </p>
               <p>"What does he look like?" </p>
               <p>"He is tall, dark, with black hair, black eyes, slender, graceful, all fire and
                  energy." </p>
               <p>"What's his name?" </p>
               <p>"St. Clare&mdash;Robert St. Clare. His father was away from home. He's a
                  politician, I think." </p>
               <p>"'You don't say! St. Clare. Well of all the jokes! His father is my Democratic
                  chum in the House&mdash;an old fire-eating Bourbon, but a capital fellow." </p>
               <p>"Did you ever see him?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0354" n="313"/>
               </p>
               <p>"No, but I've had good times with his father. He used to own a hundred slaves.
                  He's a royal fellow, and pretty well fixed in life for a Southern politician. I
                  don't think though I ever saw his boy. Anything really serious?" </p>
               <p>"He hasn't said a word&mdash;but he's coming to see me next week." </p>
               <p>"Well things are moving, I must say!" </p>
               <p>"Yes, I pretended I must consult you, before telling him he could come. I didn't
                  want to seem too anxious. I'm half afraid to let him wander about Boston much,
                  there are too many girls here." </p>
               <p>Her father laughed proudly and looked at her. "I hope you will find him all your
                  heart most desires, and my congratulations on your first love!" </p>
               <p>"It will be my last, too," she answered seriously. </p>
               <p>"Ah! you're too young and petty to say that!" </p>
               <p>"I mean it," she said earnestly with a smile trembling on her lips. </p>
               <p>Her father was silent and pressed her hand for an answer. As they entered the gate
                  of the house, they met young Harris coming out with some books under his arm. He
                  bowed gracefully to them and passed on. </p>
               <p>"Oh! Papa, I had forgotten all about your fad for that young negro!" </p>
               <p>"Well, what of it, dear" </p>
               <p>"You love me my very much, don't you?" she asked tenderly. "I'm going to ask you
                  to be inconsistent, for my sake." </p>
               <p>"That's easy. I'm often that for nobody's sake. Consistency is only the terror of
                  weak minds." </p>
               <p>"I'm going to ask you to keep that young negro out of the house when my Southern
                  friends are here. After my sweetheart comes I expect Sallie and her mother. I
                  wouldn't have either of them to meet him here in our <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0355" n="314"/> library and especially in our
                  dining-room for anything on earth!" </p>
               <p>"Well, you have joined the rebels, haven't you?" </p>
               <p>"You know I never did like negroes any way," she continued. "They always gave me
                  the horrors. Young Harris is a scholarly gentleman, I know. He is good-looking,
                  talented, and I've played his music for him sometimes to please you, but I can't
                  get over that little kink in his hair, his big nostrils and full lips, and when he
                  looks at me, it makes my flesh creep." </p>
               <p>"Certainly, my darling, you don't need to coax me. The Lowells, I suspect, know by
                  this time what is due to a guest. When your guests come, our home and our time are
                  theirs. If eating meat offends, we will live on herbs. I'll send Harris down to
                  the other side of the district and keep him at work there until the end of the
                  campaign. My slightest wish is law for him." </p>
               <p>"You see, Papa," she went on, "they never could understand that negro's easy ways
                  around our house, and I know if he were to sit down at our table with them they
                  would walk out of the dining-room with an excuse of illness and go home on the
                  first train." </p>
               <p>"And yet," returned her father lifting her from the carriage, "their homes were
                  full of negroes were they not?" </p>
               <p>"Yes, but they know their place. I've seen those beautiful Southern children kiss
                  their old black 'Mammy.' It made me shudder, until I discovered they did it just
                  as I kiss Fido." </p>
               <p>"And this a daughter of Boston, the home of Garrison and Sumner!" he exclaimed. </p>
               <p>"I've heard that Boston mobbed Garrison once," she observed. </p>
               <p>"Yes, and I doubt if we have canonised Sumner yet. All right. If you say so, I'll
                  order a steam calliope stationed <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0356" n="315"/> at the
                  gate and hire a man to play Dixie for you!" </p>
               <p>She laughed, and ran up the steps. </p>
               <p>* * * * * * </p>
               <p>Sallie determined to keep the secret of her sorrow in her own heart. On the ocean
                  voyage she had cried the whole first day, and then kissed her lover's picture, put
                  it down in the bottom of her trunk, brushed the tears away and determined the
                  world should not look an her suffering. </p>
               <p>She had written Helen of her lover's declaration, and of her happiness. She would
                  find a good excuse for her sorrowful face in their separation. She knew he would
                  write to her, for he had said so, and she had slipped the address into his hand as
                  he left the car that night. </p>
               <p>At first she was puzzled to think what she could do about answering these letters
                  so Helen would not suspect her trouble. Then she hit on the plan of writing to him
                  every day, posting the letters herself and placing them in her own trunk instead
                  of the post-box. </p>
               <p>"He will read them some day. They will relieve my heart," she sadly told herself. </p>
               <p>Helen met her on the pier with a cry of girlish joy, and the first word she
                  uttered was, </p>
               <p>"Oh! Sallie, Bob loves me! He's been here two weeks, and he's just gone home. I
                  have been in heaven. We are engaged!" </p>
               <p>"Then I'll kiss you again, Helen!"&mdash;She gave her another kiss. </p>
               <p>"And I've a big letter at home for you already! It's post-marked 'Hambright.' It
                  came this morning. I know you will feast on it. If Bob don't write me faithfully
                  I'll make him come here and live in Boston." </p>
               <p>When Sallie got this letter, she sat down in her room, <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0357" n="316"/> and read and re-read its passionate
                  words. There was a tone of bitterness and wounded pride in it. She struggled
                  bravely to keep the tears back. Then the tone of the letter changed to tenderness
                  and faith and infinite love that struggled in vain for utter ance. </p>
               <p>She kissed the name and sighed. "Now I must go down and chat and smile with Helen.
                  She's so silly about her own love, if I talk about Bob she will forget I live." </p>

               <p>When Gaston reached Hambright the following day, and whispered to his mother the
                  good news, he hastened to tell his friend Tom Camp. The young man's heart warmed
                  toward the white-haired old soldier in this hour of his victory. With sparkling
                  eyes, he told Tom of his stormy scene with the General, of its curious ending, and
                  the hours he spent in heaven beneath the limbs of an old magnolia. </p>
               <p>Tom listened with rapture. "Ah, didn't I tell you, if you hung on you'd get her
                  by-and-by? So you bearded the General in his den did you? I'll bet his eyes blazed
                  when he seed you! He's got an awful temper when you rile him. You ought to seed
                  him one day when our brigade was ordered into a charge where three concealed
                  batteries was cross firin' and men was fallin' like wheat under the knife. Geeminy
                  but didn't he cuss! He wouldn't take the order fust from the orderly, and sent to
                  know if the Major-General meant it. I tell you us fellers that was layin' there in
                  the grass listenin' to them bullets singin' thought he was the finest cusser that
                  ever ripped an oath. </p>
               <p>"He reared and he charged, and he cussed, and he damned that man for tryin' to
                  butcher his men, and he never moved till the third order came. That was the night
                  ten thousand wounded men lay on the field, and me in the middle of 'em with a
                  Minie ball in my shoulder. <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0408" n="365"/> The Yankees
                  and our men was all mixed up together, and just after dark the full moon came up
                  through the trees and you could see as plain as day. I begun to sing the old hymn,
                  "There is a land of pure delight," and you ought to have heard them ten thousand
                  wounded men sing! </p>
               <p>"While we was singing the General came through lookin' up his men. He seed me and
                  said, </p>
               <p>'Is that you, Tom Camp?' </p>
               <p>"I looked up at him, and he was crying like a child, and he went on from man to
                  man cryin' and cussin' the fool that sent us into that hell-hole. The General's a
                  rough man, if you rub his fur the wrong way, but his heart's all right. He's all
                  gold I tell you!" </p>
               <p>"Well, I'm in for a tussle with him, Tom." </p>
               <p>"Shucks, man, you can beat him with one hand tied behind you if you've got his
                  gal's heart. She's got his fire, and a gal as purty as she is can just about do
                  what she pleases in this world." </p>
               <p>"I hope she can bring him around. I like the General. I'd much rather not fight
                  him." </p>
               <p>"Where's Flora?" cried Tom looking around in alarm. </p>
               <p>"I saw her going toward the spring in the edge of the woods there a minute ago,"
                  replied Gaston. </p>
               <p>Tom sprang up and began to hop and jump down the path toward the spring with
                  incredible rapidity. </p>
               <p>Flora was playing in the branch below the spring and Tom saw the form of a negro
                  man passing over the opposite hill going along the spring path that led in that
                  direction. </p>
               <p>"Was you talkin' with that nigger, Flora?" asked Tom holding his hand on his side
                  and trying to recover his breath. </p>
               <p>"Yes, I said howdy, when he stopped to get a drink <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0409" n="366"/> of water, and he give me a whistle," she
                  replied with a pout of her pretty lips and a frown. </p>
               <p>Tom seized her by the arm and shook her. "Didn't I tell you to run every time you
                  seed a nigger unless I was with you!" </p>
               <p>"Yes, but he wasn't hurtin' me and you are!" she cried bursting into tears. </p>
               <p>"I've a notion to whip you good for this!" Tom stormed. </p>
               <p>"Don't Tom, she won't do it any more, will, you Flora?" pleaded Gaston taking her
                  in his arms and starting to the house with her. When they reached the house, Tom
                  was still pale and trembling with excitement. </p>
               <p>"Lord, there's so many triflin' niggers loafin' round the county now stealing and
                  doin' all sorts of devilment, I'm scared to death about that child. She don't seem
                  any more afraid of 'em than she is of a cat." </p>
               <p>'I don't believe anybody would hurt Flora, Tom,&mdash;she's such a little
                  angel," said Gaston kissing the tears from the child's face. </p>
               <p>"She is cute&mdash;ain't she?" said Tom with pride. I've wished many a time
                  lately I'd gone out West with them Yankee fellers that took such a likin' to me in
                  the war. They told me that a poor white man had a chance out there, and that there
                  wern't a nigger in twenty miles of their home. But then I lost my leg, how could I
                  go? </p>
               <p>He sat dreaming with open eyes for a moment and continued, looking tenderly a
                  Flora, "But, baby, don't you dare go nigh er nigger, or let one get nigh you no
                  more 'n you would a rattlesnake!" </p>
               <p>"I won't Pappy! she cried with an incredulous smile at his warning of danger that
                  made Tom's heart sick. She was all joy and laughter, full of health and bubbling
                     <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0410" n="367"/> life. She believed with a child's
                  simple faith that all nature was as innocent as her own heart. </p>
               <p>Tom smoothed her curls and kissed her at least, and she slipped her arm around his
                  neck and squeezed it tight. </p>
               <p>"Ain't she purty and sweet now?" he exclaimed. </p>
               <p>"Tom, you'll spoil her yet," warned Gaston as he smiled and took his leave,
                  throwing a kiss to Flora as he passed through the little yard gate. Tom had built
                  a fence close around his house when Flora was a baby to shut her in while he was
                  at work. </p>
               <p>Two days later about five o'clock in the afternoon as Gaston sat in his office
                  writing a letter to his sweetheart, his face aglow with love and the certainty
                  that she was his, as he read and re-read her last glowing words he was startled by
                  the sudden clang of the court house bell. At first he did not move, only looking
                  up from his paper. Sometimes mischievous boys rang the bell and ran down the steps
                  before any one could catch them. But the bell continued its swift stroke seeming
                  to grow louder and wilder every moment. He saw a man rush across the square, and
                  then the bell of the Methodist, and then of the Baptist churches joined their
                  clamour to the alarm. </p>
               <p>He snapped the lid of his desk, snatched his hat and ran down the steps. </p>
               <p>As he reached the street, he heard the long piercing cry of a woman's voice, high,
                  strenuous, quivering! </p>
               <p>"A lost child! A lost child!" </p>
               <p>What a cry! He was never so thrilled and awed by a human voice. In it was
                  trembling all the anguish of every mother's broken heart transmitted through the
                  centuries! </p>
               <p>At the court house door an excited group had gathered. A man was standing on the
                  steps gesticulating wildly and telling the crowd all he knew about it. Over the
                  din he caught the name, </p>
               <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0411" n="368"/>
               <p>"Tom Camp's Flora!" </p>
               <p>He breathed hard, bit his lips and prayed instinctively. </p>
               <p>"Lord have mercy on the poor old man! It will kill him!" A great fear brooded over
                  the hearts of the crowd, and soon the tumult was hushed into an awed silence. </p>
               <p>In Gaston's heart that fear became a horrible certainty from the first. Within a
                  half hour a thousand white people were in the crowd. Gaston stood among them, cool
                  and masterful, organising them in searching parties, and giving to each group the
                  signals to be used. </p>
               <p>In a moment the white race had fused into a homogeneous mass of love, sympathy,
                  hate, and revenge. The rich and the poor, the learned and the ignorant, the banker
                  and the blacksmith, the great and the small, they were all one now. The sorrow of
                  that old one-legged soldier was the sorrow of all, every heart beat with his, and
                  his life was their life, and his child their child. </p>
               <p>But at the end of an hour there was not a negro among them! By some subtle
                  instinct they had recognised the secret feelings and fears of the crowd and had
                  disappeared. Had they been beasts of the field the gulf between them would not
                  have been deeper. </p>
               <p>When Gaston reached Tom's house the crowd was divided into the groups agreed upon
                  and a signal gun given to each. If the child was not dead when found two should be
                  fired&mdash;if dead, but one. </p>
               <p>He sought Tom to be sure there was no mistake and that the child had not fallen
                  asleep about the house. He found the old man shut up in his room kneeling in the
                  middle of the floor praying. </p>
               <p>When Gaston laid his hand gently on his shoulder his lips ceased to move, and he
                  looked at him in a dazed sort of way at first without speaking. </p>
               <p>"Oh!&mdash;it's you, Charlie!" he sighed. <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0412"
                     n="369"/>
               </p>
               <p>"Yes, Tom, tell me quick. Are you sure she is nowhere in the house?" </p>
               <p>"Sure!&mdash;Sure?" he cried in a helpless stare. "Yes, yes, I found her
                  bonnet at the spring. I looked everywhere for an hour before I called the
                  neighbours!" </p>
               <p>"Then I'm off with the searchers. The signal is two guns if they find her alive.
                  One gun if she is dead. You will understand." </p>
               <p>"Yes, Charlie," answered the old soldier in a faraway tone of voice, "and don't
                  forget to help me pray while you look for her." </p>
               <p>"I've tried already, Tom," he answered as he pressed his hand and left the house.
                  All night long the search continued, and no signal gun was heard. Torches and
                  lanterns gleamed from every field and wood, byway and hedge for miles in every
                  direction. </p>
               <p>Through every hour of this awful night Tom Camp was in his room
                  praying&mdash;his face now streaming with tears, now dry and white with the
                  unspoken terror that could stop the beat of his heart. His white hair and
                  snow-white beard were dishevelled, as he unconsciously tore them with his
                  trembling hands. Now he was crying in an agony of intensity, </p>
               <p>"As thy servant of old wrestled with the angel of the Lord through the night, so,
                  oh God, will I lie at Thy feet and wrestle and pray! I will not let Thee go until
                  Thou bless me! Though I perish, let her live! I have lost all and praised Thee
                  still. Lord, Thou canst not leave me desolate!" </p>
               <p>From the pain of his wound and the exhaustion of soul and body he fainted once
                  with his lips still moving in prayer. For more than an hour he lay as one dead.
                  When he revived, he looked at his clock and it was but an hour till dawn. </p>
               <p>Again he fell on his knees, and again the broken accents <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0413" n="370"/> of his husky voice could be heard
                  wrestling with God. Now he would beg and plead like a child, and then he would
                  rise in the unconscious dignity of an immortal soul in combat with the powers of
                  the infinite and his language was in the sublime speech of the old Hebrew seers! </p>
               <p>Just before the sun rose the signal gun pealed its message of life, ONE! TWO! in
                  rapid succession. </p>
               <p>Tom sprang to his feet with blazing eyes. One! Two! echoed the guns from another
                  hill, and fainter grew its repeated call from group to group of the searchers. </p>
               <p>"There! Glory to God!" He screamed at the top of his voice, the last note of his
                  triumphant shout breaking into sobs. "God be praised! I knew they would find
                  her&mdash;she's not dead, she's alive! alive! oh! my soul, lift up thy head!" </p>
               <p>The tramp of swift feet as heard at the door and Gaston told him with husky
                  stammering voice, </p>
               <p>"She's alive Tom, but unconscious. I'll have her brought to the house. She was
                  found just where your spring branch runs into the Flat Rock, not five hundred
                  yards from here in those woods. Say where you are. We will bring her in a minute." </p>
               <p>Gaston bounded back to the scene. </p>
               <p>Tom paid no attention to his orders to stay at home, but sprang after him jumping
                  and falling and scrambling up again as he followed. Before they knew it he was
                  upon the excited tearful group that stood in a circle around the child's body. </p>
               <p>Gaston, who was standing on the opposite side from Tom's approach, saw him and
                  shouted, </p>
               <p>"My God, men, stop him! Don't let him see her yet!" </p>
               <p>But Tom was too quick for them. He brushed aside the boy who caught at him, as
                  though a feather, crying, </p>
               <p>"Stand back!" <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0414" n="371"/>
               </p>
               <p>The circle of men fell away from the body and in a moment Tom stood over it
                  transfixed with horror. </p>
               <p>Flora lay on the ground with her clothes torn to shreds and stained with blood.
                  Her beautiful yellow curls were matted across her forehead in a dark red lump
                  beside a wound where her skull had been crushed. The stone lay at her side, the
                  crimson mark of her life showing on its jagged edges. </p>
               <p>With that stone the brute had tried to strike the death blow. She was lying on the
                  edge of the hill with her head up the incline. It was too plain, the terrible
                  crime that had been committed. </p>
               <p>The poor father sank beside her body with an inarticulate groan as though some one
                  had crushed his head with an axe. He seemed dazed for a moment, and looking around
                  he shouted hoarsely, </p>
               <p>"The doctor boys! The doctor quick! For God's sake, quick! She's not dead
                  yet&mdash;we may save her&mdash;help&mdash;help!" he sank again to the
                  ground limp and faint from pain and was soon insensible. </p>
               <p>Gaston gathered the child tenderly in his arms and carried her to the house. The
                  men hastily made a stretcher and carried Tom behind him. </p>

               <head> CHAPTER V<lb/> A THOUSAND-LEGGED BEAST </head>

               <p>While Gaston and the men were carrying Flora and Tom to the house, another
                  searching party was formed. There were no women and children among than, only
                  grim-visaged silent men, and a pair of little mild-eyed sharp-nosed blood-hounds.
                  All the morning men were coming in from the country and joining this silent army
                  of searchers. </p>
               <p>Doctor Graham came, looked long and gravely at Flora and turned a sad face toward
                  Tom. </p>
               <p>"Now, doctor wait&mdash;don't say a word yet. I don't want to know the truth,
                  if it's the worst. Don't kill me in a minute. Let me live as long as there's
                  breath in her body&mdash;after that! well, that's the end&mdash;there's
                  nothin after that!" </p>
               <p>The doctor started to speak. </p>
               <p>"Wait," pleaded Tom, "let me tell you something. I've been praying all night. I've
                  seen God face to face. She can't die. He told me so&mdash;" </p>
               <p>He paused and his grip on the doctor's arm relaxed as though he were about to
                  faint, but he rallied. </p>
               <p>The kindly old doctor said gently, "Sit down Tom." </p>
               <p>He tried to lead Tom away from the bed, but he held on like a bull dog. </p>
               <p>The child breathed heavily and moaned. <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0416" n="373"/>
               </p>
               <p>Tom's face brightened. "She's comin' to, doctor,&mdash;thank God!" </p>
               <p>The doctor paid no more attention to him and went on with his work as best he
                  could. </p>
               <p>Tom laid his tear-stained face close to hers, and murmured soothingly to her as he
                  used to when she was a wee baby in his arms, </p>
               <p>"There, there, honey, it will be all right now! The doctor's here, and he'll do
                  all he can! And what can't do, God will. The doctor'll save you. God will save
                  you! He loves you. He loves me. I prayed all night. He heard me. I saw the shinin'
                  glory of His face! He's only tryin' His poor old servant. </p>
               <p>The broken artery was found and tied and the bleeding stopped. When the wound on
                  her head was dressed the doctor turned to Tom, </p>
               <p>"That wound is bad, but not necessarily fatal." </p>
               <p>"Praise God!" </p>
               <p>"Keep the house quiet and don't let her see a strange face once she regains
                  consciousness," was his parting injunction. </p>
               <p>The next morning her breathing was regular, and pulse stronger, but feverish; and
                  about seven o'clock she came out of her comatose state and regained consciousness.
                  She spoke but once, and apparently at the sound of her own voice immediately went
                  into a convulsion, clinching her little fists, screaming and calling to her father
                  for help! </p>
               <p>When Tom first heard that awful cry and saw her terrified eyes and drawn face, he
                  tried to cover his own eyes and stop his ears. Then he gathered the little
                  convulsed body into his arms and crooned into her ears, </p>
               <p>"There, Pappy's baby, don't cry! Pappy's got you now. Nothin' can hurt you. There,
                  there, nothin' shall come nigh you!" <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0417" n="374"/>
               </p>
               <p>He covered her face with tears and kisses while he whispered and soothed her to
                  sleep. When the noon train came up from Independence, General Worth arrived. Tom
                  had asked Gaston to telegraph for him in his name. </p>
               <p>Tom eagerly grasped his hand. "General I knowed you'd come&mdash;you're a man
                  to tie to. I never knowed you to fail me in your life. You're one of the smartest
                  men in the world too. You never got us boys in a hole so deep you didn't pull us
                  out"&mdash; </p>
               <p>"What can I do for you?" interrupted the General. </p>
               <p>"Ah, now's the worst of all, General. I'm in water too deep for me. My baby, the
                  last one left on earth, the apple of my eye, all that holds my old achin' body to
                  this world&mdash;she's&mdash;about&mdash;to&mdash;die! I can't let
                  her. General, you must save her for me. I want more doctors. They say there's a
                  great doctor at Independence. I want 'em all. Tell 'em it's a poor old one-legged
                  soldier who's shot all to pieces and lost his wife and all his
                  children&mdash;all but this one baby. And I can't lose her! They'll come if
                  you ask 'em&mdash;" His voice broke. </p>
               <p>"I'll do it, Tom. I'll have them here on a special in three hours or maybe
                  sooner," returned the General pressing his hand and hurrying to the telegraph
                  office. </p>
               <p>The doctors arrived at three o'clock and held a consultation with Doctor Graham.
                  They decided that the loss of blood had been so great that the only chance to save
                  her was in the transfusion of blood. </p>
               <p>"I'll give her the blood, Tom," said Gaston quietly removing his cost and baring
                  his arm. </p>
               <p>The old soldier looked up through grateful tears. </p>
               <p>"Next to the General, you're the best friend God ever give me, boy!" </p>
               <p>The General turned his face away and looked out of the window. The doctors
                  immediately performed the operation, transfusing blood from Gaston into the child.
                     <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0418" n="375"/> The results did not seem to promise
                  what they had hoped. Her fever rose steadily. She became conscious again and
                  immediately went into the most fearful convulsions, breaking the torn artery a
                  second time. </p>
               <p>Just as the sun sank behind the blue mountains' peaks in the west her heart
                  fluttered and she was dead. </p>
               <p>Tom sat by the bed for two hours, looking, looking, looking with wide staring eyes
                  at her white dead face. There was not the trace of a tear. His mouth was set in a
                  hard cold way and he never moved or spoke. </p>
               <p>The Preacher tried to comfort Tom, who stared at him as though he did not
                  recognise him at first, and then slowly began, </p>
               <p>"Go away, Preacher, I don't want to see or talk to you now. It's all a swindle and
                  a lie. There is no God!" </p>
               <p>"Tom, Tom!" groaned the Preacher. </p>
               <p>"I tell you I mean it," he continued. "I don't want any more of God or His heaven.
                  I don't want to see God. For if I should see Him, I'd shake my fist in His face
                  and ask Him where His almighty power was when my poor little baby was screamin'
                  for help while that damned black beast was tearin' her to pieces! Many and many a
                  time I've praised God when I read the Bible there where it said, not a sparrow
                  falleth to the ground without His knowledge, and the very hairs of our head are
                  numbered. Well, where was He when my little bird was flutterin' her broken
                  bleedin' wings in the claws of that stinkin' baboon,&mdash;damn him to
                  everlastin' hell!&mdash;It's all a swindle I tell you!" </p>
               <p>The Preacher was watching him now with silent pity and tenderness. </p>
               <p>"What a lie it all is!" Tom repeated. "Scratch my name off the church roll. I
                  ain't got many more days here, but I won't lie. I'm not a hypocrite. I'm going to
                  meet God cursin' Him to His face!" <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0419" n="376"/>
               </p>
               <p>The Preacher slipped his arm around the old soldier's neck, and smoothed the
                  tangled hair back from his forehead as he said brokenly, </p>
               <p>"Tom, I love you! My whole soul is melted in sympathy and pity for you!" </p>
               <p>The stricken man looked up into the face of his friend, saw his tears and felt the
                  warmth of his love flood his heart, and at last he burst into tears. </p>
               <p>"Oh! Preacher, Preacher! you're a good friend I know, but I'm done, I can't live
                  any more! Every minute, day and night, I'll hear them awful screams&mdash;her
                  a callin' me for help! I can see her lyin' out there in the woods all night alone
                  moanin' and bleedin'!" </p>
               <p>His breast heaved and he paused as if in reverie. And then he sprang up, his face
                  livid and convulsed with volcanic passions, that half strangled him while he
                  shrieked, </p>
               <p>"Oh! if I only had him here before me now, and God Almighty would give me strength
                  with these hands to tear his breast open and rip his heart
                  out!&mdash;I&mdash;could&mdash;eat&mdash;it&mdash;like&mdash;a&mdash;wolf!" </p>
               <p>* * * * * * </p>
               <p>When they reached the cemetery the next day and the body was about to be lowered
                  into the grave, Tom suddenly spied old Uncle Reuben Worth leaning on his spade by
                  the edge of the crowd. Uncle Reuben was the grave digger of the town and the only
                  negro present. </p>
               <p>"Wait!" said Tom raising his hand. "Don't put her in that grave! A nigger dug it.
                  I can't stand it:" He turned to a group of old soldier comrades standing by and
                  said, </p>
               <p>"Boys, humour an old broken man once more. You'll dig another grave for me, won't
                  you? It won't take long. The folks can go home that don't want to stay. I ain't
                  got no home to go to now but this graveyard." <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0420"
                     n="377"/>
               </p>
               <p>His comrades filled up the grave that Uncle Reuben had dug, and opened a new one
                  on the other side of the graves where slept his other loved ones. </p>
               <p>Gaston took Tom to his home and stayed with him several hours trying to help him.
                  He seemed to have settled into a stupor from which nothing could rouse him When at
                  length the old man fell asleep, Gaston softly closed the door and returned to his
                  office with a heavy heart. </p>
               <p>As he neared the centre of the town, he heard a murmur like the distant moaning of
                  the wind in the hush that comes before a storm. It grew louder and louder and
                  became articulate with occasional words that seemed far away and unreal. What
                  could it be? He had never heard such a sound before. Now it became clearer and the
                  murmur was the tread of a thousand feet and the clatter of horses' hoofs. Not a
                  cry, or a shout, or a word. Silence and hurrying feet! </p>
               <p>Ah! he knew now. It was a searchers returning, a grim swaying voiceless mob with
                  one black figure amid them. They were swarming into the court house square under
                  the big oak where an informal trial was to be held. </p>
               <p>He rushed forward to protest against a lynching. He could just catch a glimpse of
                  the negro's head swaying back and forth, protesting innocence in a singing
                  monotone as though he were already half dead. </p>
               <p>He pushed his way roughly through the excited crowd, to the centre where Hose
                  Norman, the leader, stood with one end of a rope in his hand and the other around
                  the negro's neck. </p>
               <p>The negro turned his head quickly toward the movement made by the crowd as Gaston
                  pressed forward. </p>
               <p>It was Dick! </p>
               <p>Dick recognised him at the same moment, leaped toward <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0421" n="378"/> and fell at his feet crying and pleading
                  as he held his feet and legs. </p>
               <p>"Save me, Charlie! I nebber done it! I nebber done it! For God's sake help me!
                  Keep 'em off! Dey gwine burn me erlive!" </p>
               <p>Gaston turned to the crowd. "Men, there's not one among you that loved that old
                  soldier and his girl as I did. But you must not do this crime. If this negro is
                  guilty, we can prove it in that court house there, and he will pay the penalty
                  with his life. Give him a fair trial"&mdash; </p>
               <p>"That's a lawyer talkin' now!" said a man in the crowd. "We know that tune. The
                  lawyers has things their own way in a court house." A murmur of assent mingled
                  with oaths ran through the crowd. </p>
               <p>"Fair trial !" sneered Hose Norman snatching Dick from the ground by the rope.
                  "Look at the black devil's clothes splotched all over with her blood. We found him
                  under a shelvin' rock where he'd got by wadin' up the branch a quarter of a mile
                  to fool the dogs. We found his track in the sand some places where he missed the
                  water and tracked him clear from where we found Flora to the cave he was lying in.
                  Fair trial&mdash;hell! We're just waitin' for er can o' oil. You go back and
                  read your law books&mdash;we'll tend ter this devil." </p>
               <p>The messenger came with the oil and the crowd moved forward. Hose shouted, "Down
                  by Tom Camp's by his spring, down the spring branch to the Flat Rock where he
                  killed her!" </p>
               <p>On the crowd moved, swaying back and forth with Gaston in their midst by Dick's
                  side begging for a fair trial for him. A crowd that hurries and does not shout is
                  a fearful thing. There is something inhuman in its uncanny silence. </p>
               <p>Gaston's voice sounded strained and discordant. They <pb/>
                  <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0424" n="379"/> paid no more attention to his protest
                  than to the chirp of a cricket. </p>
               <p>They reached the spot where the child's body had been found. They tied the
                  screaming, praying negro to a live pine and piled around his body a great heap of
                  dead wood and saturated it with oil. And then they poured oil on his clothes. </p>
               <p>Gaston looked around him begging first one man then another to help him fight the
                  crowd and rescue him. Not a hand was lifted, or a voice raised in protest. There
                  was not a negro among them. Not only was no negro in that crowd, but there was not
                  a cabin in all that county that would not have given shelter to that brute, though
                  they knew him guilty of the crime charged against him. This was the one terrible
                  fact that paralysed Gaston's efforts. </p>
               <p>Hose Norman stepped forward to apply a match and Gaston grasped his arm. </p>
               <p>"For God's sake, Hose, wait a minute!" he begged. "Don't disgrace our town, our
                  county, our state, and our claims to humanity by this insane brutality. A beast
                  wouldn't do this. You wouldn't kill a mad dog or a rattlesnake in such a way. If
                  you will kill him, shoot him or knock him in the head with a rock,&mdash;don't
                  burn him alive!" </p>
               <p>Hose glared at him and quietly remarked, </p>
               <p>"Are you done now? If you are, stand out of the way!" </p>
               <p>He struck the match and Dick uttered a scream. As Hose leaned forward with his
                  match Gaston knocked him down, and a dozen stalwart men were upon him in a moment. </p>
               <p>"Knock the fool in the head!" one shouted. </p>
               <p>"Pin his arms behind him!" said another. </p>
               <p>Some one quickly pinioned his arms with a cord. He <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0425" n="380"/> stood in helpless rage and pity, and as
                  he saw the match applied, bowed his head and burst into tears. </p>
               <p>He looked up at the silent crowd standing there like voiceless ghosts with renewed
                  wonder. </p>
               <p>Under the glare of the light and the tears the crowd seemed to melt into a great
                  crawling swaying creature, half reptile half beast, half dragon half man, with a
                  thousand legs and a thousand eyes, and ten thousand gleaming teeth, and with no
                  ear to hear and no heart to pity! </p>
               <p>All they would grant him was the privilege of gathering Dick's ashes and charred
                  bones for burial. </p>
               <p>* * * * * * </p>
               <p>The morning following the lynching, the Preacher hurried to Tom Camp's to see how
                  he was bearing the strain. </p>
               <p>His door was wide open, the bureau drawers pulled out, ransacked, and some of
                  their contents were lying on the floor. </p>
               <p>"Poor old fellow, I'm afraid he's gone crazy!" exclaimed the Preacher. He hurried
                  to the cemetery. There he found Tom at the newly made grave. He had worked through
                  the night and dug the grave open with his bare hands and pulled the coffin up out
                  of the ground. He had broken his finger nails all off trying to open it and his
                  fingers were bleeding. At last he had given up the effort to open the coffin, sat
                  down beside it, and was arranging her toys he had made for her beside the box. He
                  had brought a lot of her clothes, a pair of little shoes and stockings, and a
                  bonnet, and he had placed these out carefully on top of the lid. He was talking to
                  her. </p>
               <p>The Preacher lifted him gently and led him away, a hopeless madman. </p>

               <head> CHAPTER VI<lb/> THE BLACK PERIL </head>

               <p>The longer Gaston pondered over the tragic events of that lynching the more
                  sinister and terrible became its meaning, and the deeper he was plunged in
                  melancholy. </p>
               <p>Beyond all doubt, within his own memory, since the negroes under Legree's lead had
                  drawn the colour line in politics, the races had been drifting steadily apart. The
                  gulf was now impassable. </p>
               <p>Such crimes as Dick had committed, and for which he had paid such an awful
                  penalty, were unknown absolutely under slavery, and were unknown for two years
                  after the war. Their first appearance was under Legree's r&eacute;gime. Now,
                  scarcely a day passed in the South without the record of such an atrocity, swiftly
                  followed by a lynching, and lynching thus had become a habit for all grave crimes. </p>
               <p>Since McLeod's triumph in the state such crimes had increased with alarming
                  rapidity. The encroachments of negroes upon public offices had been slow but
                  resistless. Now there were nine hundred and fifty negro magistrates in the state
                  elected for no reason except the colour of their skin. Feeling themselves
                  intrenched behind state and Federal power, the insolence of a class of young negro
                  men was becoming more and more intolerable. What would happen to these fools when
                  once they roused that thousand-legged, thousand-eyed beast with its ten <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0427" n="382"/> thousand teeth and nails! He had looked
                  into its face, and he shuddered to recall the hour. </p>
               <p>He knew that this power of racial fury of the Anglo-Saxon when aroused was
                  resistless, and that it would sweep its victims before its wrath like chaff before
                  a whirlwind. </p>
               <p>And then he thought of the day fast coming when culture and wealth would give the
                  African the courage of conscious strength and he would answer that soul piercing
                  shriek of his kindred for help, and that other thousand-legged beast, now
                  crouching in the shadows, would meet thousand legged beast around that beacon fire
                  of a Godless revenge! </p>
               <p>More and more the impossible position of the Negro in America came home to his
                  mind. He was fast being overwhelmed with the conviction that sooner or later we
                  must squarely face the fact that two such races, counting millions in numbers, can
                  not live together under a Democracy. </p>
               <p>He recalled the fact that there were more negroes in the United States than
                  inhabitants in Mexico, the third republic of the world. </p>
               <p>Amalgamation simply meant Africanisation. The big nostrils, flat nose, massive
                  jaw, protruding lip and kinky hair will register their animal marks over the
                  proudest intellect and the rarest beauty of any other race. The rule that had no
                  exception was that one drop of Negro blood makes a negro. </p>
               <p>What could be the outcome of it? What was his duty as a citizen and a member of
                  civilised society? Since the scenes through which he had passed with Tom Camp and
                  that mob the question was insistent and personal. It clouded his soul and weighed
                  on him like the horrors of a nightmare. </p>
               <p>Again and again the fateful words the Preacher had <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0428" n="383"/> dinned into his ears since childhood
                  pressed upon him, </p>
               <p>"You can not build in a Democracy a nation inside a nation of two antagonistic
                  races. The future American must be an Anglo-Saxon or a Mulatto." </p>
               <p>His depression and brooding over the fearful events in which he had so recently
                  taken part had tinged his life and all its hopes with sadness. He had reflected
                  this in his letters to Sallie Worth without even mentioning the events. His heart
                  was full of sickening foreboding. How could one love and be happy in a world
                  haunted by such horrors! He had begged her to hasten her hour of final decision.
                  He told her of his sense of loneliness and isolation, and of his inexpressible
                  need of her love and presence in his daily life. </p>
               <p>Her answer had only intensified his moody feelings. She had written that her love
                  grew stronger every day and his love more and more became necessary to her life,
                  and yet she could not cloud its future with the anger of her father and the broken
                  heart of her mother by an elopement. She feared such a shock would be fatal and
                  all her life would be embittered by it. They must wait. She was using all her
                  skill to win her father, but as yet without success. But she determined to win
                  him, and it would be so. </p>
               <p>All this seemed so far away and shadowy to Gaston's eager restless soul. </p>
               <p>The letter had closed by saying she was preparing for another trip to Boston to
                  visit Helen Lowell and that she should be absent at least a month. She asked that
                  his next letter be addressed to Boston. </p>
               <p>Somehow Boston seemed just then out of the world on another planet, it was so far
                  away and its people and their life so unreal to his imagination. </p>
               <p>But he sighed and turned resolutely to his work of <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0429" n="384"/> preparation for an event in his life
                  which he meant to make great in the history of the state. It was the meeting of
                  the Democratic convention, as yet nearly two years in the future. He held a
                  subordinate position in his party's councils, but defeat and ruin had taken the
                  conceit out of the old line leaders and he knew that his day was drawing near. </p>
               <p>"I'll take my place among the leaders and masters of men," he told himself with
                  quiet determination, "I will compel the General's respect; and if I can not win
                  his consent, I will take her without it." </p>

               <head> CHAPTER VII<lb/> EQUALITY WITH A RESERVATION </head>

               <p>The lynching at Hambright had stirred the whole nation into unusual indignant
                  interest. It happened to be the climax of a series of such crimes committed in the
                  South in rapid succession, and the death of this negro was reported with more than
                  usual vividness by a young newspaper man of genius. </p>
               <p>A grand mass meeting was called in Cooper Union, New York, at which were gathered
                  delegates from different cities and states to give emphasis and unity to the
                  movement and issue an appeal to the national government. </p>
               <p>When Sallie Worth reached Boston, she found Helen Lowell at home alone. The Hon.
                  Everett Lowell had made one of the speeches of his career at the mass meeting held
                  in Faneuil Hall, and he was in New York where he had gone to make the principal
                  address in the Cooper Union Convention of Negro sympathisers. </p>
               <p>George Harris had accompanied him, supremely fascinated by the eloquent and
                  masterful appeal for human brotherhood he had heard him make in Boston. There was
                  something pathetic in the dog-like worship this young negro gave to his brilliant
                  patron. In his life in New England he had been shocked more than once by the
                  brutal prejudices of the people against his race. His soul had been tried to the
                  last of its powers of endurance at times. He found to his amazement that, when put
                  to <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0431" n="386"/> the test, the masses of the North
                  had even deeper repugnance to the person of a Negro than the Southerners who grew
                  up with him from the cradle. He had found himself cut off from every honourable
                  way of earning his bread, gentleman and scholar though he was, and had looked into
                  the river as he walked over the bridge to Cambridge one night with a well-nigh
                  resistless impulse to end it all. </p>
               <p>But Lowell had cheered him, laughed his gloomy ideas to scorn, and more practical
                  still, he had secured him a clerkship in the Custom House which settled the
                  problem of bread. Others had failed him, but this man of trained powers had never
                  failed him. He had taught him to lift up his head and look the world squarely in
                  the face. Lowell was, to his vivid African imagination, the ideal man made in the
                  image of God, calm in judgment, free from all superstitions and prejudices, a
                  citizen of the world of human thought, a prince of that vast ethical aristocracy
                  of free thinkers of all ages who knew no racial or conventional barriers between
                  man and man. </p>
               <p>Harris had published a volume of poems which he had dedicated to Lowell, and his
                  most inspiring verse was simply the outpouring of his soul in worship of this
                  ideal man. </p>
               <p>He was his devoted worshipper for another and more powerful reason. In his daily
                  intercourse with him in his library during his campaigns he had frequently met his
                  beautiful daughter, and had fallen deeply and madly in love with her. This secret
                  passion he had kept hidden in his sensitive soul. He had worshipped her from afar
                  as though she had been a white-robed angel. To see her and be in the same house
                  with her was all he asked. Now and then he had stood beside the piano and turned
                  the music while she played and sang one of his new pieces, and he would live on
                  that for month, eating his heart out with voiceless yearnings he dared not expose.
                     <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0432" n="387"/>
               </p>
               <p>In his music he made his greatest success. There was a fiery sweep to his passion,
                  and a deep oriental rhythm in his cadence that held the imagination of his hearers
                  in a spell. It is needless to say it was in this music he breathed his secret
                  love. </p>
               <p>At first he had not dared to hope for the day when he could declare this secret or
                  take his place in the list of her admirers and fight for his chance. But of late,
                  a great hope had filled his soul and illumined the world. As he had listened to
                  Lowell's impassioned appeals for human brotherhood, his scathing ridicule of pride
                  and prejudice, and the poetic beauty of the language in which he proclaimed his
                  own emancipation from all the laws of caste, the fiery eloquence with which he
                  trampled upon all the barriers man had erected against his fellow man, his soul
                  was thrilled into ecstasy with the conviction that this scholar and scientific
                  thinker, at least, was a free man. He was sure that he had risen above the
                  limitations of provincialisms, racial or national prejudices. </p>
               <p>He had begun to dream of the day he would ask this Godlike man for the privilege
                  of addressing his daughter. </p>
               <p>The great meeting at Cooper Union had brought this dream to a sudden resolution.
                  Lowell had outdone himself that night. With merciless invective he had denounced
                  the inhuman barbarism of the South in these lynchings. The sea of eager faces had
                  answered his appeals as water the breath of a storm. He felt its mighty reflex
                  influence sweep back on his soul and lift him to greater heights. He demanded
                  equality of man on every inch of this earth's soil. </p>
               <p>"I demand this perfect equality," he cried, "absolutely without reservation or
                  subterfuge, both in form and essential reality. It is the life-blood of Democracy.
                  It is the reason of our existence. Without this we are a living lie, a stench in
                  the nostrils of God and humanity!" <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0433" n="388"/>
               </p>
               <p>A cheer from a thousand negro throats rent the air as he thus closed. The crowd
                  surged over the platform and for ten minutes it was impossible to restore order or
                  continue the programme. Young Harris pressed his patron's hand and kissed it while
                  tears of pride and gratitude rained down his face. </p>
               <p>This speech made a national sensation. It was printed in full in all the partisan
                  papers where it was hoped capital might be made of it for the next political
                  campaign, and the National Campaign Committee of which be was a member ordered a
                  million copies of it printed for distribution among the negroes. </p>
               <p>When Lowell and Harris reached Boston, as they parted at the depot Harris said, </p>
               <p>"Will you be at home to-morrow, Mr. Lowell?" </p>
               <p>"Yes, why?" </p>
               <p>"I would like a talk with you in the morning on a matter of grave importance. May
                  I call at nine o'clock?" </p>
               <p>"Certainly. Come right into the library. You'll find me there, George." </p>
               <p>That night as Lowell walked through his brilliantly lighted home, he felt a sense
                  of glowing pride and strength. With his hands behind him he paced back and forth
                  in his great library and out through the spacious hall with firm tread and flushed
                  face. He felt he could look these great ancestors in the face to-night as they
                  gazed down on him hm their heavy gold frames. They had called him to high
                  ambitions and a strenuous life when his indolence had pleaded for ease and the
                  dilettanteism of a fruitless dreaming. His father had cultivated his artistic
                  tastes, dreamed and done nothing. But these grim-visaged, eagle-eyed ancestors had
                  called him to a life of realities, and he had heard their voices. </p>
               <p>Yes, to-night his name was on a million lips. The <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0434"
                     n="389"/> door of the United States Senate was opening at his touch and
                  mightier possibilities loomed in the future. </p>
               <p>He felt a sense of gratitude for the heritage of that stately old home and its
                  inspiring memories. Its roots struck down into the soil of a thousand years, and
                  spread beneath the ocean to that greater old world life. He felt his heart beat
                  with pride that he was adding new honours to that family history, and adding to
                  the soul-treasures his daughter's children would inherit. </p>
               <p>Seated in the library next morning Harris was nervous and embarrassed. He made two
                  or three attempts to begin the subject but turned aside with some unimportant
                  remark. </p>
               <p>"Well, George, what is the problem that makes you so grave this morning?" asked
                  Lowell with kindly patronage. </p>
               <p>Harris felt that his hour had come, and he must face it. He leaned forward in his
                  chair and looked steadily down at the rug, while he clasped both his hands firmly
                  across his lap and spoke with great rapidity. </p>
               <p>"Mr. Lowell, I wish to say to you that you have taught me the greatest faith of
                  life, faith in my fellow man without which there can be no faith in God. What I
                  have suffered as a man as I have come in contact with the brutality with which my
                  race is almost universally treated, God only can ever know. </p>
               <p>"The culture I have received has simply multiplied a thousandfold my capacity to
                  suffer. But for the inspiration of your manhood I would have ended my life in the
                  river. In you, I saw a great light. I saw a man really made in the image of God
                  with mind and soul trained, with head erect, scorning the weak prejudices of
                  caste, which dare to call the image of God clean or unclean in passion or pride. </p>
               <p>"I lifted up my head and said, one such man redeems <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0435" n="390"/> a world from infamy. It's worth while to
                  live in a world honoured by one such man, for he is the prophecy of more to come." </p>
               <p>He paused a moment, fidgeted with a piece of paper he had picked up from the table
                  and seemed at a loss for a word. </p>
               <p>It never dawned on Lowell what he was driving at. He supposed, as a matter of
                  course, he was referring to his great speeches and was going to ask for some
                  promotion in a governmental department at Washington. </p>
               <p>"I'm proud to have been such on inspiration to you, George. You know how much I
                  think of you. What is on your mind?" he asked at length. </p>
               <p>"I have hidden it from every human eye, sir, I am afraid to breath it aloud alone.
                  I have only tried to sing it in song in an impersonal way. Your wonderful words of
                  late have emboldened me to speak. It is this&mdash;I am madly, desperately in
                  love with your daughter." </p>
               <p>Lowell sprang to his feet as though a bolt of lightning had suddenly shot down his
                  backbone. He glared at the negro with wide dilated eyes and heaving breath as
                  though he had been transformed into a leopard or tiger and was about to spring at
                  his throat. </p>
               <p>Before answering, and with a gesture commanding silence, he walked rapidly to the
                  library door and closed it. </p>
               <p>"And I have come to ask you," continued Harris ignoring his gesture, "if I may pay
                  my addresses to her with your consent." </p>
               <p>"Harris, this is crazy nonsense. Such an idea is preposterous. I am amazed that it
                  should ever have entered your head. Let this be the end of it here and now, if you
                  have any desire to retain my friendship." </p>
               <p>Lowell said this with a scowl, and an emphasis of indignant rising inflection. The
                  negro seemed stunned by <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0436" n="391"/> this swift blow
                  in his very teeth, that seemed to place him outside the pale of a human being. </p>
               <p>"Why is such a hope unreasonable, sir, to a man of your scientific mind?" </p>
               <p>"It is a question of taste," snapped Lowell. </p>
               <p>"Am I not a graduate of the same university with you? Did I not stand as high, and
                  age for age, am I not your equal in culture?" </p>
               <p>"Granted. Nevertheless you are a negro, and I do not desire the infusion of your
                  blood in my family." </p>
               <p>"But I have more of white than Negro blood, sir." </p>
               <p>"So much the worse. It is the mark of shame." </p>
               <p>"But it is the one drop of Negro blood at which your taste revolts, is it not?" </p>
               <p>"To be frank, it is." </p>
               <p>"Why is it an unpardonable sin in me that my ancestors were born under tropic
                  skies where skin and hair were tanned and curled to suit the sun's fierce rays?" </p>
               <p>"All tropic races are not negroes, and your race has characteristics apart from
                  accidents of climate that make it unique in the annals of man," rejoined Lowell. </p>
               <p>"And yet you demand perfect equality of man with man, absolutely in form and
                  substance without reservation or subterfuge!" </p>
               <p>"Yes, political equality." </p>
               <p>"Politics is but a secondary phenomenon of society. You said absolute equality,"
                  protested Harris. </p>
               <p>"The question you broach is a question of taste, and the deeper social instincts
                  of racial purity and self preservation. I care not what your culture, or your
                  genius, or your position, I do not desire, and will not permit, a mixture of Negro
                  blood in my family. The idea is nauseating, and to my daughter it would be
                  repulsive beyond the power of words to express it!" </p>
               <p>"And yet," pleaded Harris, "you invited me to your <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0437" n="392"/> home, introduced me to your daughter,
                  seated me at your table, and used me in your appeal to your constituents, and now
                  when I dare ask the privilege of seeking her hand in honourable marriage, you, the
                  scholar, patriot, statesman and philosopher of Equality and Democracy, slam the
                  door in my face and tell me that I am a negro! Is this fair or manly?" </p>
               <p>"I fail to see its unfairness." </p>
               <p>"It is amazing. You are a master of history and sociology. You know as clearly as
                  I do that social intercourse is the only possible pathway to love. And you opened
                  it to me with your own hand. Could I control the beat of my heart? There are some
                  powers within us that are involuntary. You could have prevented my meeting your
                  daughter as an equal. But all the will power of earth could not prevent my loving
                  her, when once I had seen her, and spoken to her. The sound of the human voice,
                  the touch of the human hand in social equality are the divine sacraments that open
                  the mystery of love." </p>
               <p>"Social rights are one thing, political rights another," interrupted Lowell. </p>
               <p>"I deny it. If you are honest with yourself, you know it is not true. Politics is
                  but a manifestation of society. Society rests on the family. The family is the
                  unit of civilisation. The right to love and wed where one loves is the badge of
                  fellowship in the order of humanity. The man who is denied this right in any
                  society is not a member of it. He is outside any manifestation of its essential
                  life. You had as well talk about the importance of clothes for a dead man, as
                  political rights for such a pariah. You have classed him with the beasts of the
                  field. As a human unit he does not exist for you." </p>
               <p>"Harris, it is utterly useless to argue a point like this," Lowell interrupted
                  coldly. "This must be the end of our acquaintance. You must not enter my house
                  again." <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0438" n="393"/>
               </p>
               <p>"My God, sir, you can't kick me out of your house like this when you brought me to
                  it, and made it an issue of life or death!" </p>
               <p>"I tell you again you are crazy. I have brought you here against her wishes. She
                  left the house with her friend this morning to avoid seeing you. Your presence has
                  always been repulsive to her, and with me it has been a political study, not a
                  social pleasure." </p>
               <p>"I beg for only a desperate chance to overcome this feeling. Surely a man of your
                  profound learning and genius can not sympathize with such prejudices? Let me
                  try&mdash;let her decide the issue." </p>
               <p>"I decline to discuss the question any further." </p>
               <p>"I can't give up without a struggle!" the negro cried with desperation. </p>
               <p>Lowell rose with impatience. </p>
               <p>"Now you are getting to be simply a nuisance. To be perfectly plain with you, I
                  haven't the slightest desire that my family with its proud record of a thousand
                  years of history and achievement shall end in this stately old house in a brood of
                  mulatto brats!" </p>
               <p>Harris winced and sprang to his feet trembling with passion. "I see," he sneered,
                  "the soul of Simon Legree has at least become the soul of the nation. The South
                  expresses the same luminous truth with a little more clumsy brutality. But their
                  way is after all more merciful. The human body becomes unconscious at the touch of
                  an oil-fed flame in sixty seconds. Your methods are more refined and more hellish
                  in cruelty. You have trained my ears to hear eyes to see, hands to touch and heart
                  to feel, that you might torture with the denial of every cry of body and soul and
                  roast me in the flames of impossible desires for time and eternity!" </p>
               <p>"That will do now. There's the door!" thundered Lowell with a gesture of stern
                  emphasis. "I happen to <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0439" n="394"/> know the
                  important fact that a man or woman of negro ancestry, though a century removed
                  will suddenly breed back to a pure negro child, thick lipped, kinky headed, flat
                  nosed, black skinned. One drop of your blood in my family could push it backward
                  three thousand years in history. If you were able to win her consent, a thing
                  unthinkable, I would do what old Virginius did in the Roman Forum, kill her with
                  my own hand, rather than see her sink in your arms into the black waters of a
                  Negroid life! Now go!" </p>

               <head> CHAPTER IX<lb/> THE NEW AMERICA </head>

               <p>Another year of struggle and suffering, hope and fear, Gaston had passed, and
                  still he was no nearer the dream of realised love. If anything had changed, the
                  General's pride had added new force to his determination that his daughter should
                  not marry the man who had defied him. </p>
               <p>His chief reliance for Gaston's defeat was on time, and the broadening of Sallie's
                  mind by extended travel. He had sent her abroad twice, and this year he sent her
                  to spend another three months in Europe. </p>
               <p>These absences seemed only to intensify her longing for her lover. On her return
                  the General would burst into a storm of rage at her persistence. She had ceased to
                  give him any bitter answers, only smiling quietly and maintaining an ominous
                  silence. </p>
               <p>He had a new cause now of dislike for the man of her choice. Gaston had become a
                  man of acknowledged power in politics and was the leader of a group of radical
                  young men who demanded the complete reorganisation of the Democratic party, the
                  shelving of the old timers, among whom he was numbered, and the announcement of a
                  radical programme upon the Negro issue. </p>
               <p>Radicalism of any sort he had always hated. Now, as advanced by this young
                  upstart, it was doubly odious. The General had never given much time to his
                  political duties, but his name was a power and he gave regularly <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0450" n="405"/> to the campaign committee the largest
                  cash contribution they received. </p>
               <p>He tried in a clumsy way to put Gaston off the State Executive Committee, but
                  failed. He saw Gaston quietly laughing at him. Then he opened his pocket book and
                  worked up a machine. It was a formidable power, and Gaston feared its influence in
                  the coming convention. </p>
               <p>While this fight was in progress, and Sallie was in Europe, the destruction of the
                  Maine in Havana harbour stilled the world into silence with the echo of its sullen
                  roar. There was a moment's pause, and the nation lifted its great silk battle
                  flags from the Capitol at Washington, and called for volunteers to wipe the empire
                  of Spain from the map of the Western world. </p>
               <p>The war lasted but a hundred days, but in those hundred days was packed the
                  harvest of centuries. </p>
               <p>War is always the crisis that flashes the search light into the souls of men and
                  nations, revealing their unknown strength and weakness, and the changes that have
                  been silently wrought in the years of peace. </p>
               <p>In these hundred days, statesmen who were giants suddenly shrivelled into pigmies
                  and disappeared from the nation's life. Young men whose names were unknown became
                  leaders of the republic and won immortal fame. </p>
               <p>We were afraid that our nation still lacked unity. The world said we were a mob of
                  money-grubbers, and had lost our grasp of principle. The president called for
                  125,000 men to die for their flag, and next morning 800,000 were struggling for
                  place in the line. </p>
               <p>We feared that religion might threaten the future with its bitter feud between the
                  Roman Catholic and Protestant in a great crisis. We saw our Catholic regiments
                  march forth to that war with screaming fife and throbbing drum and the flag of our
                  country above them, going forth to fight an army that had been blessed by the Pope
                     <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0451" n="406"/> of Rome. The flag had become the
                  common symbol of eternal justice, and the nation the organ through which all
                  creeds and cults sought for righteousness. </p>
               <p>We feared the gulf between the rich and the poor had become impassable, and we saw
                  the millionaire's son take his place in the ranks with the workingman. The first
                  soldier wearing our uniform who fell before Santiago with a Spanish bullet in his
                  breast, was an only son from a palatial home in New York, and by his side lay a
                  cowboy from the West and a ploughboy from the South. Once more we showed the world
                  that classes and clothes are but thin disguises that hide the eternal childhood of
                  the soul. </p>
               <p>Sectionalism and disunity had been the most terrible realities in our national
                  history. Our fathers had a poet leader whose soul dreamed a beautiful dream called
                     <hi rend="italic">E Pluribus Unum.</hi> But it had remained a dream. New
                  England had threatened secession years before South Carolina in blind rage led the
                  way. The Union was saved by a sacrifice of blood that appalled the world. And
                  still millions feared the South might be false to her plighted honour at
                  Appomattox. The ghost of Secession made and unmade the men and measures of a
                  generation. </p>
               <p>Then came the trumpet call that put the South to the test of fire and blood. The
                  world waked next morning to find for the first time in our history the dream of
                  union a living fact. There was no North, no South,&mdash;but from the James to
                  the Rio Grande the children of the Confederacy rushed with eager flushed faces to
                  defend the flag their fathers had once fought. </p>
               <p>And God reserved in this hour for the South, land of ashes and tombs and tears,
                  the pain and glory of the first offering of life on the altar of the new nation.
                  Our first and only officer who fell dead on the deck of a warship, with the flag
                  above him, was Worth Bagley, of <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0452" n="407"/> North
                  Carolina, the son of a Confederate soldier. The gallant youngster who stood on the
                  bridge of the Merrimac, and between two towering mountains of flaming cannon, in
                  the darkness of night blew up his ship and set a new standard of Anglo-Saxon
                  daring, was the son of a Confederate soldier of North Carolina. </p>
               <p>The town of Hambright furnished a whole company of eighty-six men, a Captain,
                  three Lieutenants, and a Major, who saw service in the war. </p>
               <p>When they were drawn up in the court house square under the old oak, the Preacher
                  stood before them and called the roll from four browned parchments. They were
                  Campbell county Confederate rosters. Every one of the eighty-six men was a child
                  of the Confederacy. And the immortal company F, that was wiped out of existence at
                  the battle of Gettysburg furnished more than half these children. </p>
               <p>"Ah, boys, blood will tell!" cried the Preacher, shaking hands with each man as
                  they left. </p>
               <p>A single round from the guns, and it was over. The yellow flag of Spain, lit with
                  the sunset splendour of a world empire, faded from the sky of the West. </p>
               <p>A new naval power had arisen to disturb the dreams of statesmen. The Oregon, that
                  fierce leviathan of hammered steel had made her mark upon the globe. In a long
                  black trail of smoke and ribbon of foam, she had circled the earth without a pause
                  for breath. The thunder of her lips of steel over the shattered hulks of a
                  European navy proclaimed the advent of a giant democracy that struck terror to the
                  hearts of titled snobs. </p>
               <p>He who dreamed this monster of steel, felt her heart beat, saw her rush through
                  foaming seas to victory, before the pick of a miner had struck the ore for her
                  ribs from a mountain side, was a child of the Confederacy&mdash;that
                  Confederacy whose desperate genius had sent the <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0453"
                     n="408"/> Alabama spinning round the globe in a whirlwind of fire. </p>
               <p>America united at last and invincible, waked to the consciousness of her
                  resistless power. </p>
               <p>And, most marvellous of all, this hundred days of war had re-united the
                  Anglo-Saxon race. This sudden union of the English speaking people in friendly
                  alliance disturbed the equilibrium of the world, and confirmed the Anglo-Saxon in
                  his title to the primacy of racial sway. </p>

               <head> CHAPTER XIII<lb/> A SPEECH THAT MADE HISTORY </head>

               <p>When General Worth received Gaston's brief and startling letter, the wires were
                  hot between New York and Asheville for hours. His last message was a peremptory
                  command to his daughter to join him immediately at Independence. </p>
               <p>When Sallie arrived at Oakwood the General was already there, and the storm broke
                  in all its fury. At every bitter word she only quietly smiled, until the General
                  was on the verge of collapse. Day after day he begged, pleaded, raged and finally
                  took to hard swearing as he looked into her calm happy face. </p>
               <p>In the meantime McLeod and his henchman on the judge's bench had seen a new light.
                  The excitement over the arrest of Gaston seemed to have fanned the flames of the
                  Red Shirt movement into a conflagration. He was alarmed at its meaning. The judge
                  heard a rumour that five thousand Red Shirts were mobilising at the foot of the
                  Blue Ridge near Hambright, and that they were going to march across the mountains,
                  into Asheville, demolish the jail, liberate Gaston, and hang the judge who had
                  committed him without bail. </p>
               <p>The rumour was a fake, but he was not taking any chances. He issued an order
                  releasing Gaston on his own recognisance, and left for a vacation. </p>
               <p>Gaston returned to Hambright showered with congratulatory telegrams from every
                  quarter of the state. <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0477" n="432"/>
               </p>
               <p>He received a brief note from Sallie saying the war was on but had not reached its
                  final climax, as the General was now devoting his best energies to the Democratic
                  convention which was to meet in ten days, when he expected to crush any "fool
                  movement of young upstarts!" </p>
               <p> Gaston knew of his organisation but he was sure the number of delegates pledged
                  to the General's machine was not enough to dominate the body, even if he could
                  hold them in line. </p>
               <p>When this convention met at Raleigh, no body of representative men were ever more
                  completely at sea as to the platform or policy upon which they would appeal to the
                  people for the overthrow of an enemy. The coalition that conquered the state and
                  held it with the grip of steel for four years was stronger than ever and was
                  absolutely certain of victory. The enormous patronage of the Federal Government
                  had been in their hands for four years, and with the state, county and municipal
                  officers, a host of powerful leaders had been gathered around McLeod's daring
                  personality. Apparently he was about to fasten the rule of the Negro and his
                  allies on the state for a generation. </p>
               <p>When Gaston entered the convention hall he received an ovation, heartfelt and
                  generous, but it did not reach the point of a disturbing element in the
                  calculations of the three or four prominent candidates for Governor. General Worth
                  had drilled his cohorts so thoroughly in opposition to him, that any sort of
                  stampeding was out of the question. </p>
               <p>The platform committee was composed of seven leaders, among whom was Gaston. There
                  was a long wrangle over the document, and at length when they reported, a
                  sensation was created. For the first time since their triumph over Simon Legree
                  the committee was divided, <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0478" n="433"/> and,
                  refusing to agree, submitted majority and minority reports. The committee stood
                  five for the majority and two for the minority. </p>
               <p>Gaston and a daring young politician from the heart of the Black Belt signed the
                  minority report. The majority report as submitted, was merely a rehash of the old
                  platform on which they had been defeated by McLeod twice, with slight additional
                  impeachment of the incapacity and corruption of the State Administration. The
                  delegates from the Black Belt and the counties where the Red Shirts had been
                  holding their noonday parades received it with silence. General Worth's machine
                  cheered it vigourously, and gave a rousing reception to their chosen champion who
                  made the presentation speech. </p>
               <p>When Gaston rose to offer and defend his minority report, a sudden hush fell on
                  the sea of eager faces. A few men in the convention had heard him speak. All had
                  heard he was an orator of power, and were anxious to see him. His leadership in
                  the Revolution of Independence and his subsequent arrest and imprisonment had made
                  him a famous man. </p>
               <p>"Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Convention:" he began with deliberate clear
                  voice which spoke of greater reserve power than the words he uttered
                  conveyed&mdash;"I move to substitute for this document of meaningless
                  platitudes the following resolution on which to make this campaign." </p>
               <p>You could have heard a pin fall, as in ringing tones like the call of bugle to
                  battle he read, </p>
               <p>"Whereas, it is impossible to build a state inside a state of two antagonistic
                  races, </p>
               <p>And whereas, the future of North Carolina must therefore be an Anglo-Saxon or a
                  Mulatto, </p>
               <p>Resolved, that the hour has now come in our history <pb
                     entity="DSSR_000002448_0479" n="434"/> to eliminate the Negro from our life and
                  reestablish for all time the government of our fathers." </p>
               <p>The delegates from New Hanover, Craven, and Halifax counties, the great centres of
                  the Black Belt, sprang on their seats with a roar of applause that shook the
                  building, and pandemonium broke loose. When one great wave subsided another
                  followed. It was ten minutes before order was restored while Gaston stood calmly
                  surveying the storm. </p>
               <p>Just before him sat General Worth, pale and trembling with excitement. The
                  audacity of those resolutions had swept him for a moment off his feet and back
                  into the years of his own daring young manhood. He could not help admiring this
                  challenge of the modern world to stand at the bar of elemental manhood and make
                  good its right to existence. He was about to summon his messengers and rally his
                  lieutenants when Gaston began to speak, and his first words chained his attention. </p>
               <p>While the tumult raised by his resolutions was in progress he lifted his eye
                  toward the gallery and there just above him where it curved toward the platform
                  sat his beautiful secret bride. His heart leaped. Her face was aflame with
                  emotion, her eyes flashing with love and pride. She slyly touched with her lips
                  the tip of her finger and blew a kiss across the intervening space. He smiled into
                  her soul a look of gratitude, and with every nerve strung to its highest tension
                  resumed his place by the speaker's stand. When the tumult died away he began a
                  speech that fixed the history of a state for a thousand years. </p>
               <p>His resolutions had wrought the crowd to the highest pitch of excitement, and his
                  words, clear, penetrating, and deliberate thrilled his hearers with electrical
                  power. </p>
               <p>"Gentlemen:" he said, and the slightest whisper was hushed. "The history of man is
                  a series of great pulse <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0480" n="435"/> bears, whose
                  flood overwhelms his future and fixes its life. Like the dammed torrent on a
                  mountain side, it breaks the conservatism that holds it stagnant for generations
                  and floods the world with its sweep. Theories, creeds, and institutions hallowed
                  by age, are cast as rubbish on the scarred hills that mark its course. The old
                  world is buried and a new one appears. </p>
               <p>"The Anglo-Saxon is entering the new century with the imperial crown of the ages
                  on his brow and the sceptre of the infinite in his hands. </p>
               <p>"The Old South fought against the stars in their courses&mdash;the resistless
                  tide of the rising consciousness of Nationality and World-Mission. The young South
                  greets the new era and glories in its manhood. He joins his voice in the cheers of
                  triumph which are ushering in this all-conquering Saxon. Our old men dreamed of
                  local supremacy. We dream of the conquest of the globe. Threads of steel have knit
                  state to state. Steam and electricity have silently transformed the face of the
                  earth, annihilated time and space, and swept the ocean barriers from the path of

                  the farce of '67, reverse the order of nature, and make these black people our
                  rulers? If not, why should the African here, who is not their equal, be allowed to

               <p>"No! No!" screamed a thousand voices. </p>
               <p>"What is our condition to-day in the dawn of the twentieth century? If we attempt

               <p>"Fifty of our great counties are again under the heel of the Negro, and the state
                  is in his clutches. Our city governments are debauched by his vote. His insolence
                  threatens our womanhood, and our children are beaten by negro toughs on the way to
                  school while we pay his taxes. Shall we longer tolerate negro inspectors of white
                  schools, and negroes in charge of white institutions? Shall we longer tolerate the

               <p>With blazing eyes, and voice that rang with the deep peal of defiant power, Gaston
                  hurled that sentence like a thunder bolt into the souls of his two thousand
                  hearers. The surging host sprang to their feet and shouted back an answer that
                  made the earth tremble! </p>
               <p>Lifting his hand for silence he continued, </p>
               <p>"It is no longer a question of bad government. It is a question of impossible
                  government. We lag behind the age dragging the decaying corpse to which we are

               <p>"I believe in God's call to our race to do His work in history. What other races
                  failed to do, you wrought in this continental wilderness, fighting pestilence,
                  hunger, cold, wild beasts, and savage hordes, until out of it all has grown the
                  mightiest nation of the earth. </p>
               <p>"Is the Negro worthy to rule over you? </p>
               <p>"Ask history. The African has held one fourth of this globe for 3000 years. He has
                  never taken one step in progress or rescued one jungle from the ape and the adder,
                  except as the slave of a superior race. </p>
               <p>"In Hayti and San Domingo he rose in servile insurrection and butchered fifty
                  thousand white men, women and children a hundred years ago. He has ruled these
                  beautiful islands since. Did he make progress with the example of Aryan
                  civilisation before him? No. But yesterday we received reports of the discovery of
                  cannibalism in Hayti. </p>
               <p>"He has had one hundred years of trial in the Northern states of this Union with
                  every facility of culture and progress, and he has not produced one man who has
                  added a feather's weight to the progress of humanity. In an hour of madness the
                  dominion of the ten great states of the South was given him without a struggle. A
                  saturnalia of infamy followed. </p>
               <p>"Shall we return to this? You must answer. The corruption of his presence in our
                  body politic is beyond the power of reckoning. We drove the Carpet-bagger from <pb

                  product, is always with us to fatten on this corruption and breed death to
                  society. The Carpet-bagger was a wolf, the Scalawag is a hyena. The one was a
                  highwayman, the other a sneak. </p>
               <p>"So long as the Negro is a factor in our political life, will violence and

                  must remove the cause. </p>
               <p>"Suffrage in America has touched the lowest tide-mud of degradation. If our cities
                  and our Southern civilisation are to be preserved, there must be a return to the
                  sanity of the founders of this Republic. </p>
               <p>"A government of the wealth, virtue and intelligence of the community, by the
                  debased and the criminal, is a relapse to elemental barbarism to which no race of

               <p>"Shall the future North Carolinian be an Anglo-Saxon or a Mulatto? That is the
                  question before you. </p>
               <p>"Nations are made by men, not by paper constitutions and paper ballots. We are not
                  free because we have a Constitution. We have a Constitution because our pioneer
                  fathers who cleared the wilderness and dared the might of kings, were freemen. It
                  was in their blood, the tutelage of generation on generation beyond the seas, the
                  evolution of centuries of struggle and sacrifice. </p>
               <p>"If you can make men out of paper, then it is possible with a scratch of a pen in
                  the hand of a madman to transform by its magic a million slaves into a million
                  kings. </p>
               <p>"We grant the Negro the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness if he
                  can be happy without exercising kingship over the Anglo-Saxon race, or dragging us
                  down to his level. But if he can not find happiness except in lording it over a
                  superior race, let him look for <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0484" n="439"/> another
                  world in which to rule. There is not room for both of us on this continent!" </p>
               <p>Again and again Gaston raised his hand to still the mad tumult of applause his
                  words evoked. </p>
               <p>"And we will fight it out on this line, if it takes a hundred years, two hundred,
                  five hundred, or a thousand. It took Spain eight hundred years to expel the Moors.
                  When the time comes the Anglo-Saxon can do in one century what the Spaniard did in
                  eight. </p>
               <p>"We have been congratulated on our self-restraint under the awful provocation of
                  the past four years. There is a limit beyond which we dare not go, for at this
                  point, self-restraint becomes pusillanimous and means the loss of manhood." </p>
               <p>He then reviewed with thrilling power the history of the state and the proud part
                  played in the development of the Republic. He showed how this border wilderness of
                  North Carolina became the cradle of American Democracy and the typical
                  commonwealth of freemen. </p>
               <p>He played with the heart-strings of his hearers in this close personal history as
                  a great master touches the strings of a harp. His voice was now low and quivering
                  with the music of passion, and then soft and caressing. He would swing them from
                  laughter to tears in a single sentence, and in the next, the lightning flash of a
                  fierce invective drove into their hearts its keen blade so suddenly the vast crowd
                  started as one man and winced at its power. </p>
               <p>Through it all he was conscious of two blue eyes swimming in tears looking down on
                  him from the gallery. </p>
               <p>The crowd now had grown so entranced, and the torrent of his speech so rapid, they
                  forgot to cheer and feared to cheer lest they should lose a word of the next
                  sentence. They hung breathless on every flash of feeling from his face or eloquent
                  gesture. <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0485" n="440"/>
               </p>
               <p>"I am not talking of a vague theory of constructive dominion," he continued, "when
                  I refer to the Negro supremacy under which our civilisation is being degraded. I
                  use words in their plain meaning. Negro supremacy means the rule of a party in
                  which negroes predominate and that means a Negro oligarchy. </p>
               <p>"I call your attention to one typical county of over forty thus degraded, the
                  county of Craven, whose quaint old city was once the Capital of this commonwealth.
                  What are the facts? The negro office-holders of Craven county include a
                  Congressman, a member of the Legislature, a Register of Deeds, the City Attorney,
                  the Coroner, two Deputy Sheriffs, two County Commissioners, a Member of the School
                  Board, three Road Overseers, four Constables, twenty-seven Magistrates, three City
                  Aldermen and four Policemen. There are sixty-two negro officials in this county of
                  12,000 inhabitants, and their member of the Legislature is a convicted felon. The
                  white people represent ninety-five per cent of the wealth and intelligence of the
                  community, and pay ninety-five per cent of its taxes and are voiceless in its
                  government. </p>
               <p>"Would a county in Massachusetts submit to such infamy? No, ten thousand times,
                  no! There is not a county in the North from Maine to California that would submit
                  to it twenty-four hours. Will the children of Lexington, Concord and Bunker Hill
                  demand such submission now from the children of Washington and Jefferson? No. The
                  passions that obscured reason have subsided. The Anglo-Saxon race is united and
                  has entered upon its world mission. </p>
               <p>"We will take from an unprofitable servant the ballot he has abused. To him that
                  hath shall be given, and from him that hath not shall be taken may even that which
                  he hath. It is the law of nature. It is the law of God. <pb

               </p>
               <p>"Yes, I confess it," he continued, "I am in a sense narrow and provincial. I love
                  mine own people. Their past is mine, their present mine, their future is a divine
                  trust. I hate the dish water of modern world-citizenship. A shallow
                  cosmopolitanism is the mask of death for the individual. It is the froth of
                  civilisation, as crime is its dregs. Race, and race pride, are the ordinances of
                  life. The true citizen of the world loves his country. His country is a part of
                  God's world. </p>
               <p>"So I confess I love my people. I love the South,&mdash;the stolid silent
                  South, that for a generation has sneered at paper-made policies, and scorned
                  public opinion. The South, old-fashioned, mediaeval, provincial, worshipping the
                  dead, and raising men rather than making money, family loving, home building,
                  tradition ridden. The South, cruel and cunning when fighting a treacherous foe,
                  with brief volcanic bursts of wrath and vengeance. The South, eloquent, bombastic,
                  romantic, chivalrous, lustful, proud, kind and hospitable. The South with her
                  beautiful women and brave men. The South, generous and reckless, never knowing her
                  own interest, but living her own life in her own way!&mdash;Yes, I love her!
                  In my soul are all her sins and virtues. And with it all she is worthy to live. </p>
               <p>"The historian tells us that all things pass in time. Wolves whelp and stable in
                  the palaces of dead kings and forgotten civilisations. Memphis, Thebes and Babylon
                  are but names to-day. So New Orleans and New York may perish. African antiquarians
                  may explore their ruins and speculate upon their life; but we may safely fix upon
                  a thousand centuries of intervening time. On your shoulders now rests the burden
                  of civilisation. We must face its responsibilities. For my part, I believe in your
                  future. </p>

                  Gaul, the freedom of the Frank, the earth-hunger of the Roman and the stoicism of
                  the Spartan are all yours by the lineal heritage of blood, from sire and dame
                  through hundreds of generations and through centuries of culture. </p>
               <p>"Will you halt now and surrender to a mob of ragged negroes led by white cowards
                  who at the first clash of conflict will hide in sewers? </p>
               <p>"I ask you, my people, freemen, North Carolinians, to rise to-day and make good
                  your right to live! The time for platitudes is past. Let us as men face the world
                  and say what we mean. </p>
               <p>"This is a white man's government, conceived by white men, and maintained by white

               <p>"If this be treason, let them that hear it make the most of it. </p>
               <p>"From the eighth day of November we will not submit to Negro dominion another day,
                  another hour, another moment! Back of every ballot is a bayonet, and the red blood
                  of the man who holds it. Let cowards hear, and remember this! Man has never yet
                  voted away his right to a revolution. </p>
               <p>"Citizen kings, I call you to the consciousness of your kingship!" </p>
               <p>Gaston closed and turned toward his seat, while the crowd hung breathless waiting
                  for his next word. When they realised that he had finished, a rumble like the
                  crash in midheaven of two storms rolled over the surging sea of men, broke against
                  the girders of the roof like the thunder of the Hatteras surf lashed by a
                  hurricane. <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0488" n="443"/> Two thousand men went mad.
                  With one common impulse they sprang to their feet screaming, shouting, cheering,
                  shaking each other's hands, crying and laughing. With the sullen roar of crashing
                  thunder another whirlwind of cheers swept the crowd, shook the earth, and pierced
                  the sky with its challenge. Wave after wave of applause swept the building and
                  flung their people, slow to anger, now terrible in wrath, were trembling with the
                  pent-up passion and fury of years. </p>
               <p>What power could resist their wrath! </p>
               <p>Through it all Gaston sat silent behind the group of the majority of the platform
                  committee, with eyes devouring a beautiful face bending toward him from the
                  gallery. She was softly weeping with love and pride too deep for words. </p>
               <p>While the tumult was still raging, before he was conscious of his presence,
                  General Worth's stalwart figure was bending over him, and grasping his hand. </p>
               <p>"My boy, I give it up. You have beaten me. I'm proud of you. I forgive everything
                  for that speech. You can have my girl. The date you've fixed for the marriage
                  suits me. Let us forget the past." </p>
               <p>Gaston pressed his hand muttering brokenly his thanks, and his soul sank within
                  him at the thought of this proud old iron-willed warrior's anger if he discovered
                  their secret marriage. </p>
               <p>The General turned toward the side of the platform; for he had seen the flash of
                  Sallie's dress on the stairs of the balcony leading to the stage. He knew her keen
                  eye had seen his surrender and his heart was hungry for the kiss of reconciliation
                  that would restore their old perfect love. </p>
               <p>He met her at the foot of the stairs and she threw her arms impulsively around his
                  neck. <pb entity="DSSR_000002448_0489" n="444"/>
               </p>
               <p>"Oh! Papa, dear! I am the happiest girl in the world. The two men of all
                  men&mdash;the only two I love&mdash;are mine forever!" </p>
               <p>While the applause was still echoing and reechoing over the sea of surging men,
                  and thousands of excited people were crowding the windows from the outside and
                  blocking the streets in every direction clamouring for admittance, a tall man with
                  grey beard and stentorian voice, sprang on the platform. It was General Worth's
                  candidate for Governor. He had not consulted the General but he had an important
                  motion to make. The crowd was stilled at last and his deep voice rang through the
                  building, </p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, I move that the minority report offered by Charles
                  Gaston"&mdash;again a thunder peal of applause&mdash;"be adopted as the
                  platform by acclamation!" </p>
               <p>A storm of "ayes" burst from the throats of the delegates in a single breath like
                  the crash of an explosion of dynamite. </p>
               <p>"And now that our eyes have seen the glory of the Lord, as we heard His messenger
                  anointed to lead His people, I move that this convention nominate by acclamation
                  for Governor&mdash;Charles Gaston!" </p>
               <p>Again two thousand men were on their feet shouting, cheering, shaking hands,
                  hugging one another and weeping and yelling like maniacs. </p>
               <p>A speech had been made that changed the current of history, and fixed the status
                  of life for millions of people. </p>
