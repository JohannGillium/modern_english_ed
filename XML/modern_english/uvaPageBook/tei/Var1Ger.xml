   <l>When whoso merely hath a little thought</l><l> 
    Will plainly think the thought which is for him,&#x2014;</l><l> 
     Not imaging another's bright or dim,</l><l> 
      Not mangling with new words what others taught;</l><l>

   It is requested that those who may have by them any 
   un-published Poems, 
   Essays, or other articles appearing to  coincide with the 
   views in which the 
   Periodical is established, and who may feel desirous of 
   contributing such 
   papers &#x2014; will forward them, for the approval of the Editor, 
   to the Office of 
   publication.  It may be relied upon that the most sincere  
   attention will be 
   paid to the examination of all manuscripts, whether they be 
   eventually 
   accepted or declined.

  <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0015" n="Advertisement"/>
  <p> <hi rend="italic">Published Monthly, price 1s.</hi>
  
  THIS Periodical will consist of original Poems, Stories 
   to develope 
   thought and principle, Essays concerning Art and other 
   subjects, and analytic 
   Reviews of current Literature &#x2014; particularly of 
   Poetry. Each number 
   will also contain an Etching; the subject to be taken from 
   the opening article 
   of the month.</p> 
  
  <p>An attempt will be made, both intrinsically and by 
   review, to claim for 
   Poetry that place to which its present development in the 
   literature of this 
   country so emphatically entitles it.</p> 
  
  <p>The endeavour held in view throughout the writings on Art 
   will be to 
   encourage and enforce an entire adherence to the simplicity 
   of nature; and 
   also to direct attention, as an auxiliary medium, to the 
   comparatively few 
   works which Art has yet produced in this spirit. It need 
   scarcely be added 
   that the chief object of the etched designs will be to 
   illustrate this aim 
   practically, as far as the method of execution will permit; 
   in which purpose 
   they will be produced with the utmost care and 
   completeness.</p>

<lg> 
<l>I LOVE my lady; she is very fair; 
</l><l>Her brow is white, and bound by simple hair; 
</l></lg> 
<lg> 
<l>Her spirit sits aloof, and high, 
</l><l>Altho' it looks thro' her soft eye 
</l><l>Sweetly and tenderly. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>As a young forest, when the wind drives thro', 
</l><l>My life is stirred when she breaks on my view. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Altho' her beauty has such power, 
</l><l>Her soul is like the simple flower 
</l><l>Trembling beneath a shower. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>As bliss of saints, when dreaming of large wings, 
</l><l>The bloom around her fancied presence flings, 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>I feast and wile her absence, by 
</l><l>Pressing her choice hand passionately &#x2014;  
</l><l>Imagining her sigh. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>My lady's voice, altho' so very mild, 
</l><l>Maketh me feel as strong wine would a child; 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>My lady's touch, however slight, 
</l><l>Moves all my senses with its might, 
</l><l>Like to a sudden fright. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>A hawk poised high in air, whose nerved wing-tips 
</l><l>Tremble with might suppressed, before he dips, 
&#x2014;  
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>In vigilance, not more intense 
</l><l>Than I; when her word's gentle sense 
</l><l>Makes full-eyed my suspense. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Her mention of a thing &#x2014; august or poor, 
</l><l>Makes it seem nobler than it was before: 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>As where the sun strikes, life will gush, 
</l><l>And what is pale receive a flush, 
</l><l>Rich hues &#x2014; a richer blush. 
</l></lg> 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0019" n="2" />
 
<lg> 
<l>My lady's name, if I hear strangers use, &#x2014;  
</l><l>Not meaning her &#x2014; seems like a lax misuse. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>I love none by my lady's name; 
</l><l>Rose, Maud, or Grace, are all the same, 
</l><l>So blank, so very tame. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>My lady walks as I have seen a swan 
</l><l>Swim thro' the water just where the sun shone. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>There ends of willow branches ride, 
</l><l>Quivering with the current's glide, 
</l><l>By the deep river-side. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Whene'er she moves there are fresh beauties stirred; 
</l><l>As the sunned bosom of a humming-bird 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>At each pant shows some fiery hue, 
</l><l>Burns gold, intensest green or blue: 
</l><l>The same, yet ever new. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>What time she walketh under flowering May, 
</l><l>I am quite sure the scented blossoms say, 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>&#x2036;O lady with the sunlit hair! 
</l><l>&#x2036;Stay, and drink our odorous air &#x2014;  
</l><l>&#x2036;The incense that we bear: 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>&#x2036;Your beauty, lady, we would ever shade; 
</l><l>&#x2036;Being near you, our sweetness might not 
fade.&#x2033; 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>If trees could be broken-hearted, 
</l><l>I am sure that the green sap smarted, 
</l><l>When my lady parted. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>This is why I thought weeds were beautiful; &#x2014;  
</l><l>Because one day I saw my lady pull 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Some weeds up near a little brook, 
</l><l>Which home most carefully she took, 
</l><l>Then shut them in a book. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>A deer when startled by the stealthy ounce, &#x2014;  
</l><l>A bird escaping from the falcon's trounce, 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Feels his heart swell as mine, when she 
</l><l>Stands statelier, expecting me, 
</l><l>Than tall white lilies be. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>The first white flutter of her robe to trace, 
</l><l>Where binds and perfumed jasmine interlace, 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Expands my gaze triumphantly: 
</l><l>Even such his gaze, who sees on high 
</l><l>His flag, for victory. 
</l></lg> 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0020" n="3" />
       <lg> 
<l>We wander forth unconsciously, because 
</l><l>The azure beauty of the evening draws:     
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>When sober hues pervade the ground,     
</l><l>And life in one vast hush seems drowned,     
</l><l>Air stirs so little sound.    
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>We thread a copse where frequent bramble spray 
</l><l>With loose obtrusion from the side roots stray,     
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>(Forcing sweet pauses on our walk):     
</l><l>I'll lift one with my foot, and talk 
</l><l>About its leaves and stalk.    
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Or may be that the prickles of some stem     
</l><l>Will hold a prisoner her long garment's hem;     
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>To disentangle it I kneel,     
</l><l>Oft wounding more than I can heal; 
</l><l>It makes her laugh, my zeal. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Then on before a thin-legged robin hops, 
</l><l>Or leaping on a twig, he pertly stops, 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Speaking a few clear notes, till nigh 
</l><l>We draw, when quickly he will fly 
</l><l>Into a bush close by. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>A flock of goldfinches may stop their flight, 
</l><l>And wheeling round a birchen tree alight 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Deep in its glittering leaves, until 
</l><l>They see us, when their swift rise will</l> 
<l>Startle a sudden thrill. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>I recollect my lady in a wood, 
</l><l>Keeping her breath and peering &#x2014; (firm she 
stood 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Her slim shape balanced on tiptoe &#x2014; ) 
</l><l>Into a nest which lay below, 
</l><l>Leaves shadowing her brow. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>I recollect my lady asking me, 
</l><l>What that sharp tapping in the wood might be? 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>I told her blackbirds made it, which, 
</l><l>For slimy morsels they count rich, 
</l><l>Cracked the snail's curling niche: 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>She made no answer.  When we reached the stone 
</l><l>Where the shell fragments on the grass were strewn, 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Close to the margin of a rill; 
</l><l>&#x2036;;The air,&#x2033; she said, &#x2036;seems damp 
and 
chill, 
</l><l>&#x2036;We'll go home if you will.&#x2033; 
</l></lg> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0021" n="4" />
       <lg> 
<l>&#x2036;Make not my pathway dull so soon,&#x2033; I cried, 
</l><l>&#x2036;See how those vast cloudpiles in sun-glow 
dyed, 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>&#x2036;Roll out their splendour: while the breeze 
</l><l>&#x2036;Lifts gold from leaf to leaf, as these 
</l><l>&#x2036;Ash saplings move at ease.&#x2033; 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Piercing the silence in our ears, a bird 
</l><l>Threw some notes up just then, and quickly stirred 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>The covert birds that startled, sent 
</l><l>Their music thro' the air; leaves lent 
</l><l>Their rustling and blent, 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Until the whole of the blue warmth was filled 
</l><l>So much with sun and sound, that the air thrilled. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>She gleamed, wrapt in the dying day's 
</l><l>Glory: altho' she spoke no praise, 
</l><l>I saw much in her gaze. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Then, flushed with resolution, I told all; &#x2014;  
</l><l>The mighty love I bore her, &#x2014; how would pall 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>My very breath of life, if she 
</l><l>For ever breathed not hers with me; &#x2014;  
</l><l>Could I a cherub be, 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>How, idly hoping to enrich her grace, 
</l><l>I would snatch jewels from the orbs of space; &#x2014; 
 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Then back thro' the vague distance beat, 
</l><l>Glowing with joy her smile to meet, 
</l><l>And heap them round her feet. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Her waist shook to my arm.  She bowed her head, 
</l><l>Silent, with hands clasped and arms straightened: 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>(Just then we both heard a church bell) 
</l><l>O God!  It is not right to tell: 
</l><l>But I remember well 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Each breast swelled with its pleasure, and her whole 
</l><l>Bosom grew heavy with love; the swift roll 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>Of new sensations dimmed her eyes, 
</l><l>Half closing them in ecstasies, 
</l><l>Turned full against the skies. 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>The rest is gone; it seemed a whirling round &#x2014;  
</l><l>No pressure of my feet upon the ground: 
</l></lg><lg> 
<l>But even when parted from her, bright 
</l><l>Showed all; yea, to my throbbing sight 
</l><l>The dark was starred with light.

<lg> 
<l>ALL seems a painted show.  I look</l> 
<l>Up thro' the bloom that's shed</l> 
<l>By leaves above my head,</l> 
<l>And feel the earnest life forsook</l> 
<l>All being, when she died: &#x2014; </l> 
<l>My heart halts, hot and dried</l> 
<l>As the parched course where once a brook</l> 
<l>Thro' fresh growth used to flow, &#x2014; </l> 
<l>Because her past is now</l> 
<l>No more than stories in a printed book.</l> 
</lg> 
 
<lg> 
<l>The grass has grown above that breast,</l> 
<l>Now cold and sadly still,</l> 
<l>My happy face felt thrill: &#x2014; </l> 
<l>Her mouth's mere tones so much expressed!</l> 
<l>Those lips are now close set, &#x2014; </l> 
<l>Lips which my own have met;</l> 
<l>Her eyelids by the earth are pressed;</l> 
<l>Damp earth weighs on her eyes;</l> 
<l>Damp earth shuts out the skies.</l> 
<l>My lady rests her heavy, heavy rest.</l> 
</lg> 
<lg> 
<l>To see her slim perfection sweep,</l> 
<l>Trembling impatiently,</l> 
<l>With eager gaze at me!</l> 
<l>Her feet spared little things that creep: &#x2014; </l> 
<l>&#x2036;We've no more right,&#x2033; she'd say,</l> 
<l>&#x2036;In this the earth than they.&#x2033;</l> 
<l>Some remember it but to weep.</l> 
<l>Her hand's slight weight was such,</l> 
<l>Care lightened with its touch;</l> 
<l>My lady sleeps her heavy, heavy sleep.</l> 
</lg> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0023" n="6" /><lg> 
<l>My day-dreams hovered round her brow;</l> 
<l>Now o'er its perfect forms</l> 
<l>Go softly real worms.</l> 
<l>Stern death, it was a cruel blow,</l> 
<l>To cut that sweet girl's life</l> 
<l>Sharply, as with a knife.</l> 
<l>Cursed life that lets me live and grow,</l> 
 
<l>Just as a poisonous root,</l> 
<l>From which rank blossoms shoot;</l> 
<l>My lady's laid so very, very low.</l> 
</lg> 
<lg> 
<l>Dread power, grief cries aloud, &#x2036;unjust,&#x2033; 
&#x2014; </l> 
<l>To let her young life play</l> 
<l>Its easy, natural way;</l> 
<l>Then, with an unexpected thrust,</l> 
<l>Strike out the life you lent,</l> 
<l>Just when her feelings blent</l> 
<l>With those around whom she saw trust</l> 
<l>Her willing power to bless,</l> 
<l>For their whole happiness;</l> 
<l>My lady moulders into common dust.</l> 
</lg> 
<lg> 
<l>Small birds twitter and peck the weeds</l> 
<l>That wave above her head,</l> 
<l>Shading her lowly bed:</l> 
<l>Their brisk wings burst light globes of seeds,</l> 
<l>Scattering the downy pride</l> 
<l>Of dandelions, wide:</l> 
<l>Speargrass stoops with watery beads:</l> 
<l>The weight from its fine tips</l> 
<l>Occasionally drips:</l> 
<l>The bee drops in the mallow-bloom, and feeds.</l> 
</lg> 
 
<lg> 
<l>About her window, at the dawn,</l> 
<l>From the vine's crooked boughs</l> 
<l>Birds chirupped an arouse:</l> 
<l>Flies, buzzing, strengthened with the morn; &#x2014; </l> 
<l>She'll not hear them again</l> 
<l>At random strike the pane:</l> 
<l>No more upon the close-cut lawn,</l> 
<l>Her garment's sun-white hem</l> 
<l>Bend the prim daisy's stem,</l> 
<l>In walking forth to view what flowers are born.</l> 
</lg> 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0024" n="7" /><lg> 
 
<l>No more she'll watch the dark-green rings</l> 
<l>Stained quaintly on the lea,</l> 
<l>To image fairy glee;</l> 
<l>While thro' dry grass a faint breeze sings,</l> 
<l>And swarms of insects revel</l> 
<l>Along the sultry level: &#x2014; </l> 
<l>No more will watch their brilliant wings,</l> 
<l>Now lightly dip, now soar,</l> 
<l>Then sink, and rise once more.</l> 
<l>My lady's death makes dear these trivial things.</l> 
</lg> 
<lg> 
<l>Within a huge tree's steady shade,</l> 
<l>When resting from our walk,</l> 
<l>How pleasant was her talk!</l> 
<l>Elegant deer leaped o'er the glade,</l> 
<l>Or stood with wide bright eyes,</l> 
<l>Staring a short surprise:</l> 
<l>Outside the shadow cows were laid,</l> 
<l>Chewing with drowsy eye</l> 
<l>Their cuds complacently:</l> 
<l>Dim for sunshine drew near a milking-maid.</l> 
</lg> 
<lg> 
<l>Rooks cawed and labored thro' the heat;</l> 
<l>Each wing-flap seemed to make</l> 
<l>Their weary bodies ache:</l> 
<l>The swallows, tho' so very fleet,</l> 
<l>Made breathless pauses there</l> 
<l>At something in the air: &#x2014; </l> 
<l>All disappeared: our pulses beat</l> 
<l>Distincter throbs: then each</l> 
<l>Turned and kissed, without speech, &#x2014; </l> 
<l>She trembling, from her mouth down to her feet.</l> 
</lg><lg> 
<l>My head sank on her bosom's heave,</l> 
<l>So close to the soft skin</l> 
<l>I heard the life within.</l> 
<l>My forehead felt her coolly breathe,</l> 
<l>As with her breath it rose:</l> 
<l>To perfect my repose</l> 
<l>Her two arms clasped my neck.  The eve</l> 
<l>Spread silently around,</l> 
<l>A hush along the ground,</l> 
<l>And all sound with the sunlight seemed to leave.</l> 
</lg> 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0025" n="8" />
<lg> 
<l>By my still gaze she must have known</l> 
<l>The mighty bliss that filled</l> 
<l>My whole soul, for she thrilled,</l> 
<l>Drooping her face, flushed, on my own;</l> 
<l>I felt that it was such</l> 
<l>By its light warmth of touch.</l> 
<l>My lady was with me alone:</l> 
<l>That vague sensation brought</l> 
<l>More real joy than thought.</l> 
<l>I am without her now, truly alone.</l> 
</lg> 
<lg> 
<l>We had no heed of time: the cause</l> 
<l>Was that our minds were quite</l> 
<l>Absorbed in our delight,</l> 
<l>Silently blessed.  Such stillness awes,</l> 
<l>And stops with doubt, the breath,</l> 
<l>Like the mute doom of death.</l> 
<l>I felt Time's instantaneous pause;</l> 
<l>An instant, on my eye</l> 
<l>Flashed all Eternity: &#x2014; </l> 
<l>I started, as if clutched by wild beasts' claws,</l> 
</lg> 
<lg> 
<l>Awakened from some dizzy swoon:</l> 
<l>I felt strange vacant fears,</l> 
<l>With singings in my ears,</l> 
<l>And wondered that the pallid moon</l> 
<l>Swung round the dome of night</l> 
<l>With such tremendous might.</l> 
<l>A sweetness, like the air of June,</l> 
<l>Next paled me with suspense,</l> 
<l>A weight of clinging sense &#x2014; </l> 
<l>Some hidden evil would burst on me soon.</l> 
</lg><lg> 
<l>My lady's love has passed away,</l> 
<l>To know that it is so</l> 
<l>To me is living woe.</l> 
<l>That body lies in cold decay,</l> 
<l>Which held the vital soul</l> 
<l>When she was my life's soul.</l> 
<l>Bitter mockery it was to say &#x2014; </l> 
<l>&#x2036;Our souls are as the same:&#x2033;</l> 
<l>My words now sting like shame;</l> 
<l>Her spirit went, and mine did not obey.</l> 
</lg> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0026" n="9" />
<lg> 
       <l>It was as if a fiery dart</l> 
<l>Passed seething thro' my brain</l> 
<l>When I beheld her lain</l> 
<l>There whence in life she did not part.</l> 
<l>Her beauty by degrees,</l> 
<l>Sank, sharpened with disease:</l> 
<l>The heavy sinking at her heart</l> 
<l>Sucked hollows in her cheek,</l> 
<l>And made her eyelids weak,</l> 
<l>Tho' oft they'd open wide with sudden start.</l> 
</lg> 
<lg> 
<l>The deathly power in silence drew</l> 
<l>My lady's life away.</l> 
<l>I watched, dumb with dismay,</l> 
<l>The shock of thrills that quivered thro'</l> 
<l>And tightened every limb:</l> 
<l>For grief my eyes grew dim;</l> 
<l>More near, more near, the moment grew.</l> 
<l>O horrible suspense!</l> 
<l>O giddy impotence!</l> 
<l>I saw her fingers lax, and change their hue.</l> 
</lg> 
<lg> 
<l>Her gaze, grown large with fate, was cast</l> 
<l>Where my mute agonies</l> 
<l>Made more sad her sad eyes:</l> 
<l>Her breath caught with short plucks and fast: &#x2014; 
</l> 
<l>Then one hot choking strain.</l> 
<l>She never breathed again:</l> 
<l>I had the look which was her last:</l> 
<l>Even after breath was gone,</l> 
<l>Her love one moment shone, &#x2014; </l> 
<l>Then slowly closed, and hope for ever passed.</l> 
</lg> 
<lg> 
<l>Silence seemed to start in space</l> 
<l>When first the bell's harsh toll</l> 
<l>Rang for my lady's soul.</l> 
<l>Vitality was hell; her grace</l> 
<l>The shadow of a dream:</l> 
<l>Things then did scarcely seem:</l> 
<l>Oblivion's stroke fell like a mace:</l> 
<l>As a tree that's just hewn</l> 
<l>I dropped, in a dead swoon,</l> 
<l>And lay a long time cold upon my face.</l> 
</lg> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0027" n="10" />
<lg> 
       <l>Earth had one quarter turned before</l> 
<l>My miserable fate</l> 
<l>Pressed on with its whole weight.</l> 
<l>My sense came back; and, shivering o'er,</l> 
<l>I felt a pain to bear</l> 
<l>The sun's keen cruel glare;</l> 
<l>It seemed not warm as heretofore.</l> 
<l>Oh, never more its rays</l> 
<l>Will satisfy my gaze.</l> 
<l>No more; no more; oh, never any more.</l>

<p>IF Painting and Sculpture delight us like other works of 
ingenuity, 
merely from the difficulties they surmount; like an egg in 
a bottle,' a tree 
made out of stone, or a face made of pigment; and the 
pleasure we receive, 
is our wonder at the achievement; then, to such as so 
believe, this treatise is 
not written.  But if, as the writer conceives, works of Fine 
Art delight us by 
the interest the objects they depict excite in the beholder, 
just as those 
objects in nature would excite his interest; if by any 
association of ideas in 
the one case, by the same in the other, without reference to 
the 
representations being other than the objects they represent: 
&#x2014;  then, 
to such as so believe, the following upon  SUBJECT' is 
addressed.  Whilst, 
at the same time, it is not disallowed that a subsequent 
pleasure may and 
does result, upon reflecting that the objects contemplated 
were the work of 
human ingenuity.</p> 
 
<p>Now the subject to be treated, is the  subject' of 
Painter and Sculptor; 
what ought to be the nature of that  subject,' how far that 
subject may be 
drawn from past or present time with advantage, how far the 
subject may 
tend to confer upon its embodiment the title,  High Art,' 
how far the subject 
may tend to confer upon its embodiment the title  Low Art;' 
what is  High 
Art,' what is  Low Art'?</p> 
 
<p>To begin then (at the end) with  High Art.'  However we 
may differ as 
to facts, the principle will be readily granted, that  High 
Art,' <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> 
Art, par excellence, Art, in its most exalted character, 
addresses 
pre-eminently the highest attributes of man, viz.: his 
mental and his moral 
faculties.</p> 
 
<p> Low Art,' or Art in its less exalted character, is that 
which addresses 
the less exalted attributes of man, viz.: his mere sensory 
faculties, without 
affecting the mind or heart, excepting through the 
volitional agency of the 
observer.</p> 
 
<p>These definitions are too general and simple to be 
disputed; but before 
we endeavour to define more particularly, let us analyze the 
subject, and see 
what it will yield.</p> 
 
<p>All the works which remain to us of the Ancients, and 
this appears 
somewhat remarkable, are, with the exception of those by 
incompetent 
artists, universally admitted to be  High Art.'  Now do we 
afford them this 
high title, because all remnants of the antique world, by 
tempting a 
comparison between what was, and is, will set the mental 
faculties at work, 
and thus address the <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0029" n="12" /> highest attributes 
of man?  Or, as 
this is owing to the agency of the observer, and not to the 
subject 
represented, are we to seek for the cause in the subjects 
themselves!</p> 
 
<p>Let us examine the subjects.  They are mostly in 
sculpture; but this 
cannot be the cause, unless all modern sculpture be 
considered  High Art.'  
This is leaving out of the question in both ages, all works 
badly executed, 
and obviously incorrect, of which there are numerous 
examples both ancient 
and modern.</p> 
 
<p>The subjects we find in sculpture are, in &#x2036;the 
round,&#x2033; 
mostly men or women in thoughtful or impassioned action: 
sometimes they 
are indeed acting physically; but then, as in the <ref target="jason" n="5">Jason</ref> adjusting his Sandal, acting by 
mechanical impulse, and thinking or looking in another 
direction.  In relievo 
we have an historical combat, such as that between the <ref target="centaurs" n="6">Centaurs and Lapith&aelig;</ref>; sometimes a 
group in conversation, sometimes a recitation of verses to 
the Lyre; a dance, 
or religious procession.</p> 
 
<p>As to the first class in &#x2036;the round,&#x2033; as they 
seem to 
appeal to the intellectual, and often to the moral 
faculties, they are naturally, 
and according to the broad definition, works of  High Art.'  
Of the relievo, 
the historical combat appeals to the passions; and, being 
historical, probably 
to the intellect.  The like may be said of the 
conversational groups, and 
lyrical recitation which follow.  The dance appeals to the 
passions and the  
intellect; since the intellect recognises therein an order 
and design, her own 
planning; while the solemn, modest demeanour in the 
religious procession 
speaks to the heart and the mind.  The same remarks will 
apply to the few 
ancient paintings we possess, always excluding such merely 
decorative 
works as are not fine art at all.</p> 
 
<p>Thus it appears that all these works of the ancients 
<hi rend="italic">might</hi> 
rationally have been denominated works of  High Art;' and 
here we remark 
the difference between the hypothetical or rational, and the 
historical account 
of facts; for though here is <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> enough why 
ancient art 
<hi rend="italic">might</hi> have been denominated  High Art,' that it 
<hi rend="italic">was</hi> so 
denominated on this account, is a position not capable of 
proof: whereas, in 
all probability, the true account of the matter runs thus 
&#x2014; The works 
of antiquity awe us by their time-hallowed presence; the 
mind is sent into a 
serious contemplation of things; and, the subject itself in 
nowise 
contravening, we attribute all this potent effect to the 
agency of the subject 
before us, and  High Art,' it becomes <hi rend="italic">then</hi> and 
<hi rend="italic">for</hi> 
<hi rend="italic">ever</hi>, with all such as &#x2036;follow its cut.&#x2033;  
But then as 
this was so named, not from the abstract cause, but from a 
result and effect; 
when a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> work is produced in a similar spirit, but 
clothed in a 
dissimilar matter, and the critics have to settle to what 
class 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0030" n="13" /> 
 
 of art it belongs, &#x2014; then is the new 
work dragged 
up o fight with the old one, like the poor beggar <ref target="irus" n="7">Irus</ref> in front of Ulysses; then are they turned 
over and applied, each to each, like the <ref target="euclid">two 
triangles in Euclid</ref>; and then, if they square, fit 
and tally in every quarter 
&#x2014; with the nude to the draped in the one, as the nude 
to the draped in 
the other &#x2014; with the standing to the sitting in the 
one, as the standing 
to the sitting in the other &#x2014; with the fat to the lean 
in the one, as the 
fat to the lean in the other &#x2014; with the young to the 
old in the one, as 
the young to the old in the other &#x2014; with head to body, 
as head to 
body; and nose to knee, as nose to knee, &amp;c. &amp;c., 
(and the critics 
have done a great deal) &#x2014; then is the work oracularly 
pronounced 
one of  High Art;' and the obsequious artist is pleased to 
consider it is.</p> 
 
<p>But if, per contra, as in the former case, the works are 
not to be literally 
reconciled, though wrought in the self-same spirit; then 
this unfortunate 
creature of genius is degraded into a lower rank of art; and 
the artist, if he 
have faith in the learned, despairs; or, if he have none, he 
<hi rend="italic">swears</hi>.  
But listen, an artist speaks: &#x2036;If I have genius to 
produce a work in 
the true spirit of high art, and yet am so ignorant of its 
principles, that  
I scarce know whereon the success of the work depends, and 
scarcely 
whether I have succeeded or no; with this ignorance and this 
power, what 
needs your knowledge or your reasoning, seeing that nature 
is all-sufficient, 
and produces a painter as she produces a plant?&#x2033;  To 
the artist (the 
last of his race), who spoke thus, it is answered, that 
science is  
not meant for him, if he like it not, seeing he can do 
without it, and seeing, 
moreover, that with it <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> he can never do.  
Science here does not 
make; it unmakes, wonderingly to find the making of what God 
has made 
&#x2014; of what God has made through the poet, leading him 
blindly by a 
path which he has not known; this path science follows 
slowly and in 
wonder.  But though science is not to make the artist, there 
is no reason in  
nature that the artist reject it.  Still, science is 
properly the birthright of the 
critic;  tis his all in all.  It shows him poets, painters, 
sculptors, his fellow 
men, often his inferiors in their want of it, his superiors 
in the ability to do 
what he cannot do; it teaches him to love them as angels 
bringing him food 
which <hi rend="italic">he</hi> cannot attain, and to venerate their works 
as a gift from the 
Creator.</p> 
 
<p>But to return to the critical errors relating to  High 
Art.'  While the 
constituents of high art were unknown, whilst its abstract 
principles were 
unsought, and whilst it was only recognized in the concrete, 
the critics, 
certainly guilty of the most unpardonable blindness, 
blundered up to the 
masses of  High Art,' left by 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0031" n="14" /> antiquity, 
saying, 
&#x2036;there let us fix our observatory,&#x2033; and here 
came out 
perspective glass, and callipers and compasses; and here 
they made squares 
and triangles, and circles, and ellipses, for, said they, 
&#x2036;this is  High 
Art,' and this hath certain proportions;&#x2033; then in the 
logic of their 
hearts, they continued, &#x2036;all these proportions we know 
by 
admeasurement, whatsoever hath these is  High Art,' 
whatsoever hath not, is 
 Low Art.'  This was as certain as the fact that the sun is 
a globe of glowing 
charcoal, because forsooth they both yield light and heat.  
Now if the 
phantom of a then embryon-electrician had arisen and told 
them  
that their &#x2036;high art marbles possessed an electric 
influence, which, 
acting in the brain of the observer, would awake in him 
emotions of so 
exalted a character, that he forthwith, inevitably nodding 
at them, must utter 
the tremendous syllables  High Art;'&#x2033; he, the then 
embryon-electrician, from that age withheld to bless and 
irradiate the 
physiology of ours, would have done something more to the 
purpose than all 
the critics and the compasses.</p> 
 
<p>Thus then we see, that the antique, however successfully 
it may have 
wrought, is not our model; for, according to that faith 
demanded at setting 
out, fine art delights us from its being the semblance of 
what in nature 
delights.  Now, as the artist does not work by the 
instrumentality of rule and 
science, but mainly by an instinctive impulse; if he copy 
the antique, unable 
as he is to segregate the merely delectable matter, he must 
needs copy  
the whole, and thereby multiply models, which the 
casting-man can do 
equally well; whereas if he copy nature, with a like 
inability to distinguish 
that delectable attribute which allures him to copy her, and 
under the same 
necessity of copying the whole, to make sure of this 
&#x2036;tenant of 
nowhere;&#x2033; we then have the artist, the instructed of 
nature, fulfilling 
his natural capacity, while his works we have as manifold 
yet various as  
nature's own thoughts for her children.</p> 
 
<p>But reverting to the subject, it was stated at the 
beginning that  Fine Art' 
delights, by presenting us with objects, which in nature 
delight us; and  High 
Art' was defined, that which addresses the intellect; and 
hence it might 
appear, as delight is an emotion of the mind, that  Low 
Art,' which 
addresses the senses, is not Fine Art at all.  But then it 
must be remembered, 
that it was neither stated of  Fine Art,' nor of  High Art,' 
that it always  
delights; and again, that delight is not entirely mental.  
To point out the 
confines of high and low art, where the one terminates and 
the other 
commences, would be difficult, if not impracticable without 
sub-defining or 
circumscribing the import of the terms, pain, pleasure, 
delight, sensory, 
mental, psychical, intellectual, objective, 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0032" n="15" />

subjective, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and then, as little or nothing would be 
gained mainly 
pertinent to the subject, it must be content to receive no 
better definitions 
than those broad ones already laid down, with their latitude 
somewhat 
corrected by practical examples.  Yet before proceeding to 
give these 
examples, it might be remarked of  High Art,' that it always 
might, if it do 
not always excite some portion of delight, irrespective of 
that subsequent 
delight consequent upon the examination of a curiosity; that 
its function is 
sometimes, with this portion of delight, to commingle grief 
or distress, and 
that it may, (though this is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> its function,) 
excite mental anguish, 
and by a reflex action, actual body pain.  Now then to 
particularize, by 
example; let us suppose a perfect and correct painting of a 
stone, a  
common stone such as we walk over.  Now although this 
subject might to a 
religious man, suggest a text of scripture; and to the 
geologist a theory of 
scientific interest; yet its general effect upon the average 
number of 
observers will be readily allowed to be more that of wonder 
or admiration at 
a triumph over the apparently impossible (to make a round 
stone upon a flat 
piece of canvass) than at aught else the subject possesses.  
Now a  
subject such as this belongs to such very low art, that it 
narrowly illudes 
precipitation over the confines of Fine Art; yet, that it is 
Fine Art is 
indisputable, since no mere mechanic artisan, or other than 
one specially 
gifted by nature, could produce it.  This then shall 
introduce us to 
&#x2036;Subject.&#x2033;  This subject then, standing where 
fine art 
gradually confines with mechanic art, and almost midway 
between them; of 
no use nor beauty; but to be wondered at as a curiosity; is 
a subject of 
scandalous import to the artist, to the artist thus gifted 
by nature with a 
talent to reproduce her fleeting and wondrous forms.  But 
if, as the writer 
doubts, nature could afford a monster so qualified for a 
poet, yet destitute of 
poetical genius; then the scandal attaches if he attempt a 
step in advance, or  
neglect to join himself to those, a most useful class of 
mechanic artists, who 
illustrate the sciences by drawing and diagram.</p> 
 
<p>But as the subject supposed is one never treated in 
painting; only 
instanced, in fact, to exemplify an extreme; let us consider 
the merits of a 
subject really practical, such as  dead game,' or  a basket 
of fruit;' and the 
first general idea such a subject will excite is simply that 
of <hi rend="italic">food</hi>, 
 something to eat.'  For though fruit on the tree, of a 
pheasant in the air, is a 
portion of nature and properly belongs to the section,  
Landscape,' a 
division of art intellectual enough; yet gather the fruit or 
bring down the  
pheasant, and you presently bring down the poetry with it; 
and although 
Sterne could sentimentalize upon a dead ass; and though a 
dead
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0033" n="16" /> 
 pheasant in the larder, or a dead sheep at 
a butcher's, may 
excite feelings akin to anything but good living; and though 
they may 
<hi rend="italic">there</hi> be the excitive causes of poetical, nay, or 
moral reflexion; yet, 
see them on the canvass, and the first and uppermost idea 
will be that of 
 <hi rend="italic">Food</hi>,' and how, in the name of decency, they ever 
came there.  It 
will be vain to argue that gathered fruit is only nature 
under a certain phase, 
and that a dead sheep or a dead pheasant is only a dead 
animal like a dead 
ass &#x2014; it will be pitiably vain and miserable 
sophistry, since we know  
that the dead pheasant in a picture will always be as 
<hi rend="italic">food</hi>, while the 
same at he poulterer's will be but a dead pheasant.</p> 
 
<p>For we have not one only, but numerous general ideas 
annexed to every 
object in nature.  Thus one of the series may be that that 
object is matter, 
one that it is individual matter, one that it is animal 
matter, one that it is a 
bird, one that it is a pheasant, one that it is a dead 
pheasant, and one that it is 
food.  Now, our general ideas or notions are not evoked in 
this order as each 
new object address the mind; but that general idea is 
<hi rend="italic">first</hi> elicited 
which accords with the first or principle destination of the 
object: thus the 
first general idea of a cowry, to the Indian, is that of 
money, not of a shell; 
and our first general idea of a dead pheasant is that of 
food, whereas to a 
zoologist it might have a different effect: but this is the 
exception.  But it 
was said, that a dead pheasant in a picture would always be 
as food, while 
the same at the poulterer's would be but a dead pheasant: 
what then 
becomes of the first general idea?  It seems to be disposed 
of thus: at  
the first sight of the shop, the idea is that of food, and 
next (if you are not 
hungry, and poets never are), the mind will be attracted to 
the species of 
animal, and (unless hunger presses) you may be led on to 
moralize like 
Sterne: but, amongst pictures, where there is nothing else 
to excite the 
general ideas of food, this, whenever adverted to, must over 
re-excite that idea; and hence it appears that these 
<hi rend="italic">esculent</hi> subjects 
might be poetical enough if exhibited all together, 
<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., they must be 
surrounded with eatables, like a possibly-poetical-pheasant 
in a poulterer's 
shop.</p> 
 
<p>Longer stress has been laid upon this subject, 
&#x2036;Still Life,&#x2033; 
than would seem justified by its insignificance, but as this 
is a branch of art 
which has never aspired to be  High Art,' it contains 
something definite in its 
character which makes it better worth the  
analysis than might appear at first sight; but still, as a 
latitude has been take 
in the investigation which is ever unavoidable in the 
handling of such 
mercurial matter as poetry (where one must spread out a 
broad definition to 
catch it wherever it runs), and as this is ever 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0034" n="17" /> 
incomprehensible to such as are unaccustomed to abstract 
thinking, from the 
difficulty of educing a rule amidst an infinite array of 
exceptions, and of 
recognising a principle shrouded in the obscurity of 
conflicting details; it 
appears expedient, before pursuing the question, to 
reinforce the first broad 
elementary principles with what definite modification they 
may have acquired 
in their progress to this point in the argument, together 
with the additional 
data which may have resulted from analytic reference to 
other correlative 
matter.</p> 
 
<p>First then, as Fine Art delights in proportion to the 
delectating interest of 
the objects it depicts, and, as subsequently stated, grieves 
or distresses in 
proportion as the objects are grievous or distressing, we 
have this resultant: 
&#x2036;Fine Art <hi rend="italic">excites</hi> in proportion to the excitor 
influence of the 
object;&#x2033; and then, that &#x2036;<hi rend="italic">fine art</hi> excites 
either the 
sensory or the mental faculties, in a like proportion to the 
excitor properties 
of the objects respectively.&#x2033;  Thus then we have, 
definitely stated, the 
powers or capabilities of <hi rend="italic">Fine Art</hi>, as regulated and 
governed by the 
objects it selects, and the objects it selects making its 
subject.  Now the 
question in hand is, &#x2036;what the nature of that 
<hi rend="italic">subject</hi> should 
be,&#x2033; but the <hi rend="italic">subject</hi> must be according to what 
fine Art  
proposes to effect; all then must depend upon this 
proposition.  For if you 
propose that Fine Art shall excite sensual pleasure, then 
such objects as 
excite sensual pleasure should form the <hi rend="italic">subject</hi> of 
Fine Art; and 
those which excite sensual pleasure in the highest degree, 
will form the 
<hi rend="italic">highest subject</hi> &#x2014; 'High Art.'  Or if you 
propose  
that Fine Art shall excite a physical energetic activity, by 
addressing the 
sensory organism, which is a phase of the former 
proposition, (for what are 
popularly called sensual pleasures, are only particular 
sensory excitements 
sought by a physical appetite, while this sensory-organic 
activity is physically 
appetent also,) then the subjects of art ought to be draw 
form such objects as 
excite a general activity, such a s field-sports, bull-fights, battles, executions, court pageants, conflagrations, 
murders; and 
those which most intensely excite this sensory-organic 
activity, by expressing 
most of physical human power or suffering, such as battles, 
executions, 
regality, murder, would afford the <hi rend="italic">highest subject</hi> of 
Fine Art, and 
consequently these would be  <hi rend="italic">High Art.</hi>'   
But if you propose (with the writer) that <hi rend="italic">Fine Art</hi> 
shall regard the 
general happiness of man, but addressing those attributes 
which are 
<hi rend="italic">peculiarly human</hi>, by exciting the activity of his 
rational and 
benevolent powers (and the writer would add, man's religious 
aspirations, 
but omits it as sufficiently evolvable from the proposition, 
and since some 
well-willing men cannot at present recognize man as a 
religious animal), 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0035" n="18" />

then the subject of Fine Art 
should be drawn from objects 
which address and excite the activity of man's rationale and 
benevolent 
powers, such as: &#x2014; acts of justice &#x2014; of mercy 
&#x2014; good 
government &#x2014; order &#x2014; acts of intellect &#x2014; 
men 
obviously speaking or thinking abstract thoughts, as evinced 
by one speaking 
to another, and looking at, or indicating, a flower, or a 
picture, or a star, or 
by looking on the wall while speaking &#x2014; or, if the 
scene be from a 
<hi rend="italic">good</hi> play, or story, or another beneficent work, then 
not only of 
men in abstract thought or meditation, but, it may be, in 
simple conversation, 
or in passion &#x2014; or a simple representation of a person 
in a play or 
story, as of <ref target="jacques">Jacques, Ferdinand, or 
Cordelia</ref>; or, in real life, portraits of those who 
are honestly beautiful; or 
expressive of innocence, happiness, benevolence, or 
intellectuality, but not of 
gluttony, wantonness, anger, hatred or malevolence, unless 
in some cases of 
justifiable satire &#x2014; of histrionic or historic 
portraiture &#x2014; 
landscape &#x2014; natural phenomena &#x2014; animals, not 
<hi rend="italic">indiscriminately</hi> &#x2014; in some cases, grand or 
beautiful buildings, 
even without figures &#x2014; any scene on sea or land which 
induces 
reflection &#x2014; all subjects from such parts of history 
as are morally or 
intellectually instructive or attractive &#x2014; and 
therefore pageants 
&#x2014; battles &#x2014; <hi rend="italic">even</hi> executions &#x2014; all 
forms of 
thought and poetry, however wild &#x2014; if consistent with 
rational 
benevolence &#x2014; all scenes serious or comic, domestic or 
historical 
&#x2014; all religious subjects proposing good that will not 
shock any 
reasonable number of reasonable men &#x2014; all subjects 
that leave the 
artist wiser and happier &#x2014; and none which 
intrinsically act otherwise 
&#x2014; to sum all, every thing or incident in nature which 
excites, or may 
be made to excite, the mind and the heart of man as a 
mentally intelligent, 
not as a brute animal, is a subject for Fine Art, at all 
times, in all places, and 
in all ages.  But as all these subjects in nature affect our 
hearts or our 
understanding in proportion to the heart and understanding 
we have to 
apprehend and to love them, those will excite us most 
intensely which we 
know most of and love most.  But as we may learn to know 
them all and to 
love them all, and what is dark to-day may be luminous 
to-morrow, and 
things, dumb to-day, to-morrow grow voiceful, and the 
strange voice of 
to-day be plain and reproach us to-morrow; who shall 
adventure to say that 
this or that is the highest?  And if it appear that all 
these subjects in nature 
<hi rend="italic">may</hi> affect us with equal intensity, and that the 
artist's 
representations affect us as the subjects affect, then it 
follows, with all these 
subjects, Fine Art may affect us equally; but the subjects 
may all be high; 
therefore, all Fine Art may be High Art.</p>

<l>SHE fell asleep on Christmas Eve.</l> 
<l>Upon her eyes' most patient calms</l> 
<l>The lids were shut; her uplaid arms</l> 
<l>Covered her bosom, I believe.</l> 
<l>Our mother, who had leaned all day</l> 
<l>Over the bed from chime to chime,</l> 
<l>Then raised herself for the first time,</l> 
<l>And as she sat her down, did pray.</l> 
<l>Her little work-table was spread</l> 
<l>With work to finish.  For the glare</l> 
<l>Made by her candle, she had care</l> 
<l>To work some distance from the bed.</l> 
<l>Without, there was a good moon up,</l>

<l>Kept in each other, praying much;</l> 
<l>A moment that the soul may touch</l> 
<l>But the heart only understands.</l> 
<l>ost unwittingly, my mind</l> 
<l>Repeated her words after her;</l> 
<l>Perhaps tho' my lips did not stir;</l> 
<l>It was scarce thought, or cause assign'd.</l> 
<l>t then in the room over us</l>

</lg> 
<p>Before any knowledge of painting was brought to Florence, 
there were 
already painters in Lucca, and Pisa, and Arezzo, who feared 
God and loved 
the art.  The keen, grave workmen from Greece, whose trade 
it was to sell 
their own works in Italy and teach Italians to imitate them, 
had already found 
rivals of the soil with skill that could forestall their 
lessons and cheapen their 
crucifixes and <hi rend="italic">addolorate</hi>, more years than is 
supposed before the art 
came at all into Florence.  The pre-eminence to which 
<ref target="ciambue" n="13">Cimabue</ref> was raised at once by his 
contemporaries, and which he still retains to a wide extent 
even in the 
modern mind, is to be accounted for, partly by the 
circumstances under 
which he arose, and partly by that extraordinary  
<hi rend="italic">purpose of fortune</hi> born with the lives of some few, 
and through 
which it is not a little thing for any who went before, if 
they are even 
remembered as the shadows of the coming of such an one, and 
<ref target="voices">the voices which prepared his way in the 
wilderness</ref>.  It is thus, almost exclusively, that the 
painters of whom I 
speak are now known. They have left little, and but little 
heed is taken of 
that which men hold to have been surpassed; it is gone like 
time gone 
&#x2014; a track of dust and dead leaves that merely led to 
the fountain.</p> 
 
<p>Nevertheless, of very late years, and in very rare 
instances, some signs of 
a better understanding have become manifest.  A case in 
point is that of the 
tryptic and two cruciform pictures at Dresden, by <ref target="chiaro" n="14">Chiaro di Messer Bello dell' Erma</ref>, to 
which the eloquent pamphlet of <ref target="chiaro">Dr. 
Aemmster</ref>has at length succeeded in attracting the 
students.  There is 
another, still more solemn and beautiful work, now proved to 
be by the same 
hand, in the gallery at Florence.  It is the one to which my 
narrative will 
relate.</p> 
 
<p>This Chiaro dell' Erma was a young man of very honorable 
family in 
Arezzo; where, conceiving art almost, as it were, for 
himself, and loving it 
deeply, he endeavored from early boyhood toward the 
imitation of any 
objects offered in nature.  The extreme longing after a 
visible embodiment of 
his thoughts strengthened as his years increased, more even 
than his sinews 
or the blood of his life; until 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0041" n="24" />
 he would feel 
faint in sunsets and at the sight of stately persons.  When 
he had lived 
nineteen years, he heard of the famous <ref target="giunta" n="15">Giunta Pisano</ref>; and, feeling much of 
admiration, with, perhaps, a little of that envy which youth 
always feels until 
it has learned to measure success by time and opportunity, 
he determined 
that he would seek out Giunta, and, if possible, become his 
pupil.</p> 
 
<p>Having arrived in Pisa, he clothed himself in humble 
apparel, being 
unwilling that any other thing than the desire he had for 
knowledge should 
be his plea with the great painter; and then, leaving his 
baggage at a house of 
entertainment, he took his way along the street, asking whom 
he met for the 
lodging of Giunta.  It soon chanced that one of that city, 
conceiving him to 
be a stranger and poor, took him into his house, and 
refreshed him; 
afterwards directing him on his way.</p> 
 
<p>When he was brought to speech of Giunta, he said merely 
that he was a 
student, and that nothing in the world was so much at his 
heart as to become 
that which he had heard told of him with whom he was 
speaking.  He was 
received with courtesy and consideration, and shewn into the 
study of the 
famous artist. But the forms he saw there were lifeless and 
incomplete; and a 
sudden exultation possessed him as he said within himself, 
&#x2036;I am the 
master of this man.&#x2033;  The blood came at first into his 
face, but the 
next moment he was quite pale and fell to trembling.  He was 
able, however, 
to conceal his emotion; speaking very little to Giunta, but, 
when he took his 
leave, thanking him respectfully.</p> 
 
<p>After this, Chiaro's first resolve was, that he would 
work out thoroughly 
some one of his thoughts, and let the world know him. But 
the lesson which 
he had now learned, of how small a greatness might win fame, 
and how little 
there was to strive against, served to make him torpid, and 
rendered his 
exertions less continual. Also Pisa was a larger and more 
luxurious city than 
Arezzo; and, when in his walks, he saw the great gardens 
laid out for 
pleasure, and the beautiful women who passed to and fro, and 
heard the 
music that was in the groves of the city at evening, he was 
taken with 
wonder that he had never claimed his share of the 
inheritance of those years 
in which his youth was cast.  And women loved Chiaro; for, 
in despite of the 
burthen of study, he was well-favoured and very manly in his 
walking; and, 
seeing his face in front, there was a glory upon it, as upon 
the face of one 
who feels a light round his hair.</p> 
 
<p>So he put thought from him, and partook of his life.  
But, one night, 
being in a certain company of ladies, a gentleman that was 
there with him 
began to speak of the paintings of a youth named 


 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0042" n="25" />

 
<ref target="bonaventura" n="16">Bonaventura</ref>,  
 
which he had seen in Lucca; adding that Giunta Pisano might 
now look for a 
rival.  When Chiaro heard this, the lamps shook before him, 
and the music 
beat in his ears and made him giddy.  He rose up, alleging 
a sudden sickness, 
and went out of that house with his teeth set.</p> 
 
<p>He now took to work diligently; not returning to Arezzo, 
but remaining 
in Pisa, that no day more might be lost; only living 
entirely to himself.  
Sometimes, after nightfall, he would walk abroad in the most 
solitary places 
he could find; hardly feeling the ground under him, because 
of the thoughts 
of the day which held him in fever.</p> 
 
<p>The lodging he had chosen was in a house that looked upon 
gardens fast 
by the Church of San Rocco.  During the offices, as he sat 
at work, he could 
hear the music of the organ and the long murmur that the 
chanting left; and if 
his window were open, sometimes, at those parts of the mass 
where there is 
silence throughout the church, his ear caught faintly the 
single voice of the 
priest.  Beside the matters of his art and a very few books, 
almost the only 
object to be noticed in Chiaro's room was a small 
consecrated image of St. 
Mary Virgin wrought out of silver, before which stood 
always, in 
summer-time, a glass containing a lily and a rose.</p> 
 
<p>It was here, and at this time, that Chiaro painted the 
Dresden pictures; as 
also, in all likelihood, the one &#x2014; inferior in merit, 
but certainly his 
&#x2014; which is now at Munich.  For the most part, he was 
calm and 
regular in his manner of study; though often he would remain 
at work 
through the whole of the day, not resting once so long as 
the light lasted; 
flushed, and with the hair from his face.  Or, at times, 
when he could not 
paint, he would sit for hours in thought of all the 
greatness the world had 
known from of old; until he was weak with yearning, like one 
who gazes 
upon a path of stars.</p> 
 
<p>He continued in this patient endeavour for about three 
years, at the end 
of which his name was spoken throughout all Tuscany. As his 
fame waxed, 
he began to be employed, besides easel-pictures, upon 
paintings in fresco: 
but I believe that no traces remain to us of any of these 
latter.  He is said to 
have painted in the Duomo: and D'Agincourt mentions having 
seen some 
portions of a fresco by him which originally had its place 
above the high altar 
in the Church of the Certosa; but which, at the time he saw 
it, being very 
dilapidated, had been hewn out of the wall, and was 
preserved in the stores 
of the convent.  Before the period of Dr. Aemmster's 
researches, however, it 
had been entirely destroyed.</p> 
 
<p>Chiaro was now famous.  It was for the race of fame that 
he had <ref target="girded" n="17">girded up his loins</ref>; and he had 


 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0043" n="26" />

 not paused until fame was reached: yet now, in 
taking breath, he found that the weight was still at his 
heart.  The years of his 
labor had fallen from him, and his life was still in its 
first painful desire.</p> 
 
<p>With all that Chiaro had done during these three years, 
and even before, 
with the studies of his early youth, there had always been 
a feeling of 
worship and service.  It was the peace-offering that he made 
to God and to 
his own soul for the eager selfishness of his aim.  <ref target="earth">There was earth, indeed, upon the hem of his 
raiment; but <hi rend="italic">this</hi> was of the heaven, heavenly</ref>. 
 
He had seasons 
when he could endure to think of no other feature of his 
hope than this: and 
sometimes, in the ecstasy of prayer, it had even seemed to 
him to behold that 
day when his mistress &#x2014; his mystical lady (<ref target="ninth">now hardly in her ninth year, but whose solemn 
smile at meeting had already lighted on his soul like the 
dove of the 
Trinity</ref>) &#x2014; even she, his own gracious and holy 
Italian art&#x2014;with 
her virginal bosom, and her unfathomable eyes, and the 
thread of sunlight 
round her brows&#x2014;should pass, through the sun that never 
sets, into the circle 
of the shadow of the tree of life, and be seen of God, and 
found good: and 
then it had seemed to him, that he, with many who, since his 
coming, had 
joined the band of whom he was one (for, in his dream, the 
body he had 
worn on earth had been dead an hundred years), were 
permitted to gather 
round the blessed maiden, and to worship with her through 
all ages and ages 
of ages, saying, Holy, holy, holy.  This thing he had seen 
with the eyes of his 
spirit; and in this thing had trusted, believing that it 
would surely come to 
pass.</p> 
 
<p>But now, (being at length led to enquire closely into 
himself,) even as, in 
the pursuit of fame, the unrest abiding after attainment had 
proved to him 
that he had misinterpreted the craving of his own spirit 
&#x2014; so also, 
now that he would willingly have fallen back on devotion, he 
became aware 
that much of that reverence which he had mistaken for faith 
had been no 
more than the worship of beauty.  Therefore, after certain 
days passed in 
perplexity, Chiaro said within himself, &#x2036;My life and 
my will are yet 
before me: I will take another aim to my life.&#x2033;</p> 
 
<p>From that moment Chiaro set a watch on his soul, and put 
his hand to no 
other works but only to such as had for their end the 
presentment of some 
moral greatness that should impress the beholder: and,  in 
doing this, he did 
not choose for his medium the action and passion of human 
life, but cold 
symbolism and abstract impersonation.  So the people ceased 
to throng 
about his pictures as heretofore; and, when they were 
carried through town 
and town to their destination, they were no longer delayed 
by the crowds 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0044" n="27" /> 


eager to gaze and admire: and no 
prayers or 
offerings were brought to them on their path, as to his 
Madonnas, and his 
Saints, and his Holy Children.  Only the critical audience 
remained to him; 
and these, in default of more worthy matter, would have 
turned their scrutiny 
on a puppet or a mantle. Meanwhile, he had no more of fever 
upon him; but 
was calm and pale each day in all that he did and in his 
goings in and out.  
The works he produced at this time have perished &#x2014; in 
all likelihood, 
not unjustly.  It is said (and we may easily believe it), 
that, though more 
labored than his former pictures, they were cold and 
unemphatic; bearing 
marked out upon them, as they must certainly have done, the 
measure of that 
boundary to which they were made to conform.</p> 
 
<p>And the weight was still close at Chiaro's heart: but he 
held in his 
breath, never resting (for he was afraid), and would not 
know it.</p> 
 
<p>Now it happened, within these days, that there fell a 
great feast in Pisa, 
for holy matters: and each man left his occupation; and all 
the guilds and 
companies of the city were got together for games and 
rejoicings.  And there 
were scarcely any that stayed in the houses, except ladies 
who lay or sat 
along their balconies between open windows which let the 
breeze beat 
through the rooms and over the spread tables from end to 
end. And the 
golden cloths that their arms lay upon drew all eyes upward 
to see their 
beauty; and the day was long; and every hour of the day was 
bright with the 
sun.</p> 
 
<p>So Chiaro's model, when he awoke that morning on the hot 
pavement of 
the Piazza Nunziata, and saw the hurry of people that passed 
him, got up 
and went along with them; and Chiaro waited for him in 
vain.</p> 
 
<p>For the whole of that morning, the music was in Chiaro's 
room from the 
Church close at hand: and he could hear the sounds that the 
crowd made in 
the streets; hushed only at long intervals while the 
processions for the 
feast-day chanted in going under his windows.  Also, more 
than once, there 
was a high clamour from the meeting of factious persons: for 
the ladies of 
both leagues were looking down; and he who encountered his 
enemy could 
not choose but draw upon him.  Chiaro waited a long time 
idle; and then 
knew that his model was gone elsewhere.  When at his work, 
he was blind 
and deaf to all else; but he feared sloth: for then his 
stealthy thoughts would 
begin, as it were, to beat round and round him, seeking a 
point for attack.  
He now rose, therefore, and went to the window.  It was 
within a short 
space of noon; and underneath him a throng of people was 
coming out 
through the porch of San Rocco.


 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0045" n="28" /></p> 
 
<p>The two greatest houses of the feud in Pisa had filled 
the church for that 
mass.  The first to leave had been the <ref target="gherghiotti" n="18">Gherghiotti</ref>; who, stopping on the 
threshold, had fallen back in ranks along each side of the 
archway: so that 
now, in passing outward, the <ref target="marotoli" n="19">Marotoli</ref> had to walk between two files 
of men whom they hated, and whose fathers had hated theirs.  
All the chiefs 
were there and their whole adherence; and each knew the name 
of each.  
Every man of the Marotoli, as he came forth and saw his 
foes, laid back his 
hood and gazed about him, to show the badge upon the close 
cap that held 
his hair.  And of the Gherghiotti there were some who 
tightened their 
girdles; and some shrilled and threw up their wrists 
scornfully, as who flies a 
falcon; for that was the crest of their house.</p> 
 
<p>On the walls within the entry were a number of tall, 
narrow frescoes, 
presenting a moral allegory of Peace, which Chiaro had 
painted that year for 
the Church.  The Gherghiotti stood with their backs to these 
frescoes: and 
among them Golzo Ninuccio, the youngest noble of the 
faction, called by the 
people of Golaghiotta, for his debased life.  This youth had 
remained for 
some while talking listlessly to his fellows, though with 
his sleepy sunken 
eyes fixed on them who passed: but now, seeing that no man 
jostled another, 
he drew the long silver shoe off his foot, and struck the 
dust out of it on the 
cloak of him who was going by, asking him how far the tides 
rose at 
Viderza.  And he said so because it was three months since, 
at that place, the 
Gherghiotti had beaten the Marotoli to the sands, and held 
them there while 
the sea came in; whereby many had been drowned.  And, when 
he had 
spoken, at once the whole archway was dazzling with the 
light of confused 
swords; and they who had left turned back; and they who were 
still behind 
made haste to come forth: and there was so much blood cast 
up the walls on 
a sudden, that it ran in long streams down Chiaro's 
paintings.</p> 
 
<p>Chiaro turned himself from the window; for the light felt 
dry between his 
lids, and he could not look.  He sat down, and heard the 
noise of contention 
driven out of the church-porch and a great way through the 
streets; and soon 
there was a deep murmur that heaved and waxed from the other 
side of the 
city, where those of both parties were gathering to join in 
the tumult.</p> 
 
<p>Chiaro sat with his face in his open hands.  Once again 
he had wished to 
set his foot on a place that looked green and fertile; and 
once again it seemed 
to him that the thin rank mask was about to spread away, and 
that this time 
the chill of the water must leave leprosy in his flesh.  The 
light still swam in 
his head, and bewildered 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0046" n="29" />


him at first; but 
when he knew his thoughts, they were these: &#x2014; </p> 
 
<p>&#x2036;Fame failed me: faith failed me: and now this 
also, &#x2014; the 
hope that I nourished in this my generation of men, &#x2014; 
shall pass from 
me, and leave my feet and my hands groping.  Yet, because of 
this, are my 
feet become slow and my hands thin.  I am as one who, 
through the whole 
night, holding his way diligently, hath smitten the steel 
unto the flint, to lead 
some whom he knew darkling; who hath kept his eyes always on 
the sparks 
that himself made, lest they should fail; and who, towards 
dawn, turning to 
bid them that he had guided God speed, sees the wet grass 
untrodden except 
of his own feet.  I am as the last hour of the day, whose 
chimes are a perfect 
number; whom the next followeth not, nor light ensueth from 
him; but in the 
same darkness is the old order begun afresh.  Men say,  This 
is not God nor 
man; he is not as we are, neither above us: let him sit 
beneath us, for we are 
many.' Where I write Peace, in that spot is the drawing of 
swords, and there 
men's footprints are red.  When I would sow, another harvest 
is ripe. Nay, it 
is much worse with me than thus much.  Am I not as a cloth 
drawn before 
the light, that the looker may not be blinded; but which 
sheweth thereby the 
grain of its own coarseness; so that the light seems 
defiled, and men say,  We 
will not walk by it.'  Wherefore through me they shall be 
doubly accursed, 
seeing that through me they reject the light. May one be a 
devil and not 
know it?&#x2033;</p> 
 
<p>As Chiaro was in these thoughts, the fever encroached 
slowly on his 
veins, till he could sit no longer, and would have risen; 
but suddenly he 
found awe within him, and held his head bowed, without 
stirring. The 
warmth of the air was not shaken; but there seemed a pulse 
in the light, and a 
living freshness, like rain.  The silence was a painful 
music, that made the 
blood ache in his temples; and he lifted his face and his 
deep eyes.</p> 
 
<p>A woman was present in his room, clad to the hands and 
feet with a 
green and grey raiment, fashioned to that time.  It seemed 
that the first 
thoughts he had ever known were given him as at first from 
her eyes, and he 
knew her hair to be the golden veil through which he beheld 
his dreams.  
Though her hands were joined, her face was not lifted, but 
set forward; and 
though the gaze was austere, yet her mouth was supreme in 
gentleness.  And 
as he looked, Chiaro's spirit appeared abashed of its own 
intimate presence, 
and his lips shook with the thrill of tears; it seemed such 
a bitter while till the 
spirit might be indeed alone.</p> 
 
<p>She did not move closer towards him, but he felt her to 
be as much with 
him as his breath.  He was like one who, scaling 
a


 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0047" n="30" />


 great steepness, hears his own voice echoed in 
some place much higher than he can see, and the name of 
which is not 
known to him. As the woman stood, her speech was with 
Chiaro: not, as it 
were, from her mouth or in his ears; but distinctly between 
them.</p> 
 
<p>&#x2036;I am an image, Chiaro, of thine own soul within 
thee. See me, 
and know me as I am. Thou sayest that fame has failed thee, 
and faith failed 
thee; but because at least thou hast not laid thy life unto 
riches, therefore, 
though thus late, I am suffered to come into thy knowledge. 
Fame sufficed 
not, for that thou didst seek fame: seek thine own 
conscience (not thy mind's 
conscience, but thine heart's), and all shall approve and 
suffice. For Fame, in 
noble soils, is a fruit of the Spring: but not therefore 
should it be said:  Lo! 
my garden that I planted is barren: the crocus is here, but 
the lily is dead in 
the dry ground, and shall not lift the earth that covers it: 
therefore I will fling 
my garden together, and give it unto the builders.' Take 
heed rather that 
thou trouble not the wise secret earth; for in the mould 
that thou throwest up 
shall the first tender growth lie to waste; which else had 
been made strong in 
its season. Yea, and even if the year fall past in all its 
months, and the soil be 
indeed, to thee, peevish and incapable, and though thou 
indeed gather all thy 
harvest, and it suffice for others, and thou remain vext 
with emptiness; and 
others drink of they streams, and the drouth rasp thy 
throat;  &#x2014; let it 
be enough that these have found the feast good, and thanked 
the giver: 
remembering that, when the winter is striven through, there 
is another year, 
whose wind is meek, and whose sun fulfilleth all.&#x2033;</p> 
 
<p>While he heard, Chiaro went slowly on his knees. It was 
not to her that 
spoke, for the speech seemed within him and his own. The air 
brooded in 
sunshine, and though the turmoil was great outside, the air 
within was at 
peace. But when he looked in her eyes, he wept. And she came 
to him, and 
cast her hair over him, and, took her hands about his 
forehead, and spoke 
again:</p> 
 
<p>&#x2036;Thou hadst said,&#x2036; she continued, gently, 
&#x2036;that 
faith failed thee. This cannot be so. Either thou hast it 
not, or thou hast it. 
But who bade thee strike the point betwixt love and faith? 
Wouldst thou sift 
the warm breeze from the sun that quickens it? Who bade thee 
turn upon 
God and say: &#x2036;Behold, my offering is of earth, and not 
worthy: thy 
fire comes not upon it: therefore, though I slay not my 
brother whom thou 
acceptest, I will depart before thou smite me.&#x2033; Why 
shouldst thou 
rise up and tell God He is not content? Had He, of His 
warrant, certified so 
to thee? Be not nice to seek out division; but possess thy 
love in sufficiency: 
assuredly this is faith, for the heart must believe first. 
What He hath set in 
thine heart to do, that do thou; and even though thou do it 



 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0048" n="31" />



 without thought of Him, it shall be well done: 
it 
is this sacrifice that He asketh of thee, and His flame is 
upon it for a sign. 
Think not of Him; but of His love and thy love. For God is 
no morbid 
exactor: he hath no hand to bow beneath, nor a foot, that 
thou shouldst kiss 
it.&#x2033;</p> 
 
<p>And Chiaro held silence, and wept into his hair which 
covered his face; 
and the salt tears that he shed ran through her hair upon 
his lips; and he 
tasted the bitterness of shame.</p> 
 
<p>Then the fair woman, that was his soul, spoke again to 
him, saying: </p> 
 
<p>&#x2036;And for this thy last purpose, and for those 
unprofitable truths 
of thy teaching, &#x2014; thine heart hath already put them 
away, and it 
needs not that I lay my bidding upon thee. How is it that 
thou, a man, 
wouldst say coldly to the mind what God hath said to the 
heart warmly? Thy 
will was honest and wholesome; but look well lest this also 
be folly, 
&#x2014; to say,  I, in doing this, do strengthen God among 
men.' When at 
any time hath he cried unto thee, saying,  My son, lend me 
thy shoulder, for I 
fall?' Deemest thou that the men who enter God's temple in 
malice, to the 
provoking of blood, and neither for his love nor for his 
wrath will abate their 
purpose, &#x2014; shall afterwards stand with thee in the 
porch, midway 
between Him and themselves, to give ear unto thy thin voice, 
which merely 
the fall of their visors can drown, and to see thy hands, 
stretched feebly, 
tremble among their swords? <ref target="givethou">Give 
thou to 
God no more than he asketh of thee; but to man also, that 
which is 
man's</ref>. In all that thou doest, work from thine own 
heart, simply; for his 
heart is as thine, when thine is wise and humble; and he 
shall have 
understanding of thee. One drop of rain is as another, and 
the sun's prism in 
all: and shalt not thou be as he, whose lives are the breath 
of One? Only by 
making thyself his equal can he learn to hold communion with 
thee, and at 
last own thee above him. Not till thou lean over the water 
shalt thou see 
thine image therein: stand erect, and it shall slope from 
thy feet and be lost. 
Know that there is but this means whereby thou may'st serve 
God with man: 
&#x2014; Set thine hand and thy soul to serve man with 
God.&#x2033;</p> 
 
<p>And when she that spoke had said these words within 
Chiaro's spirit, she 
left his side quietly, and stood up as he had first seen 
her; with her fingers 
laid together, and her eyes steadfast, and with the breadth 
of her long dress 
covering her feet on the floor. And, speaking again, she 
said:</p> 
 
<p>&#x2036;Chiaro, servant of God, take now thine Art unto 
thee, and paint 
me thus, as I am, to know me: weak, as I am, and in the 
weeds of this time; 
only with eyes which seek out labour, and with a faith, not 
learned, yet 
jealous of prayer. Do this; so shall thy soul stand before 
thee always, and 
perplex thee no more.&#x2033;

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0049" n="32" /></p> 
 
<p>And Chiaro did as she bade him. While he worked, his face 
grew solemn 
with knowledge: and before the shadows had turned, his work 
was done. 
Having finished, he lay back where he sat, and was asleep 
immediately: for 
the growth of that strong sunset was heavy about him, and he 
felt weak and 
haggard; like one just come out of a dusk, hollow country, 
bewildered with 
echoes, where he had lost himself, and who has not slept for 
many days and 
nights. And when she saw him lie back, the beautiful woman 
came to him, 
and sat at his head, gazing, and quieted his sleep with her 
voice. </p> 
 
<p>The tumult of the factions had endured all that day 
through all Pisa, 
though Chiaro had not heard it: and the last service of that 
Feast was a mass 
sung at midnight from the windows of all the churches for 
the many dead 
who lay about the city, and who had to be buried before 
morning, because of 
the extreme heats.</p> 
 
<p>In the Spring of 1847 I was at Florence. Such as were 
there at the same 
time with myself &#x2014; those, at least, to whom Art is 
something, 
&#x2014; will certainly recollect how many rooms of the Pitti 
Gallery were 
closed through that season, in order that some of the 
pictures they contained 
might be examined, and repaired without the necessity of 
removal. The hall, 
the staircases, and the vast central suite of apartments, 
were the only 
accessible portions; and in these such paintings as they 
could admit from the 
sealed <hi rend="italic">penetralia</hi> were profanely huddled together, 
without respect 
of dates, schools, or persons. </p> 
 
<p>I fear that, through this interdict, I may have missed 
seeing many of the 
best pictures. I do not mean <hi rend="italic">only</hi> the most talked of: 
for these, as 
they were restored, generally found their way somehow into 
the open rooms, 
owing to the clamours raised by the students; and I remember 
how old 
Ercoli's, the curator's, spectacles used to be mirrored in 
the reclaimed 
surface, as he leaned mysteriously over these works with 
some of the 
visitors, to scrutinize and elucidate.</p> 
 
<p>One picture, that I saw that Spring, I shall not easily 
forget. It was 
among those, I believe, brought from the other rooms, and 
had been hung, 
obviously out of all chronology, immediately beneath that 
head by Raphael 
so long known as the &#x2036;Berrettino,&#x2033; and now said 
to be the 
portrait of Cecco Ciulli.</p> 
 
<p>The picture I speak of is a small one, and represents 
merely the figure of 
a woman, clad to the hands and feet with a green and grey 
raiment, chaste 
and early in its fashion, but exceedingly simple. She is 
standing: her hands 
are held together lightly, and her eyes set earnestly 
open.</p> 
 
<p>The face and hands in this picture, though wrought with 
great delicacy, 
have the appearance of being painted at once, in a single 
sitting: the drapery 
is unfinished. As soon as I saw the figure, it drew an awe 
upon me, like  
water in shadow. I shall not attempt to describe it more 
than I have already 
done; for the most absorbing wonder of it was its 
literality. You knew that 
figure, when painted, had been seen; yet it was not a thing 
to be seen of men. 
This language will appear ridiculous to such as have never 
looked on the 
work; and it may be even to some among those who have. On 
examining it 
closely, I perceived in one corner of the canvass the words 
<ref target="manus" n="20"><hi rend="italic">Manus Animam pinxit</hi></ref>, and the 
date 1239.</p> 
 
<p>I turned to my Catalogue, but that was useless, for the 
pictures were all 
displaced. I then stepped up to the Cavaliere Ercoli, who 
was in the room at 
the moment, and asked him regarding the 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0050" n="33" /> 



subject of authorship of the painting. He treated the 
matter, I thought, 
somewhat slightingly, and said that he could show me the 
reference in the 
Catalogue, which he had compiled. This, when found, was not 
of much 
value, as it merely said, &#x2036;<ref target="schizzo">Schizzo 
d'autore incerto</ref>,&#x2033; adding the inscription.<ref target="footnote" n="21">*</ref> I could willingly have 
prolonged my inquiry, in the hope that it might somehow lead 
to some 
result; but I had disturbed the curator from certain yards 
of Guido, and he 
was not communicative. I went back therefore, and stood 
before the picture 
till it grew dusk.</p> 
 
<p>The next day I was there again; but this time a circle of 
students was 
round the spot, all copying the &#x2036;Berrettino.&#x2033; I 
contrived, 
however, to find a place whence I could see <hi rend="italic">my</hi> 
picture, and where I 
seemed to be in nobody's way. For some minutes I remained 
undisturbed; 
and then I heard, in an English voice: &#x2036;Might I beg of 
you, sir, to 
stand a little more to this side, as you interrupt my 
view.&#x2033;</p> 
 
<p>I felt vext, for, standing where he asked me, a glare 
struck on the picture 
from the windows, and I could not see it. However, the 
request was 
reasonably made, and from a countryman; so I complied, and 
turning away, 
stood by his easel. I knew it was not worth while; yet I 
referred in some way 
to the work underneath the one he was copying. He did not 
laugh, but he 
smiled as we do in England: &#x2036;<hi rend="italic">Very</hi> odd, is it 
not?&#x2033; 
said he.</p> 
 
<p>The other students near us were all continental; and 
seeing an 
Englishman select an Englishman to speak with, conceived, I 
suppose, that 
he could understand no language but his own. They had 
evidently been 
noticing the interest which the little picture appeared to 
excite in me.</p> 
 
<p>One of them, and Italian, said something to another who 
stood next to 
him. He spoke with a Genoese accent, and I lost the sense in 
the villainous 
dialect. &#x2036;<ref target="che" n="22">Che so?</ref>&#x2033; 
replied 
the other, lifting his eyebrows toward the figure; 
&#x2036;<ref target="roba">roba mistica:  st' Inglesi son matti sul 
misticismo: 
somiglia alle nebbie di l&agrave;. Li fa pensare alla patria, 
&#x2036;E intenerisce il 
core</ref></p> 
 
<p>Lo d&#x00EC; ch' han detto ai dolci amici adio.&#x2033;</p> 
<p>&#x2036;La notte, vuoi dire,&#x2033; said a third.</p> 
 
<p>There was a general laugh. My compatriot was evidently a 
novice in the 
language, and did not take in what was said. I remained 
silent, being 
amused.</p> 
 
<p> <ref target="et" n="23">Et toi done?</ref>&#x2033; said he who 
had 
quoted Dante, turning to a student, whose birthplace was 
unmistakable even 
had he been addressed in any other language: &#x2036;<ref target="que" n="24">que dis-tu de ce genre-l&agrave;?</ref>&#x2033;</p> 
 
<p>&#x2036;Moi?&#x2033; returned the Frenchman, standing back 
from his 
easel, and looking at me and at the figure, quite politely, 
though with an 
evident reservation:<ref target="je">&#x2036;Je dis, mon 
cher, 
que c'est une sp&#x00E9;cialit&#x00E9; dont je me fiche pas mal. Je tiens 
que quand on ne 
comprend pas une chose, c'est qu' elle ne signifie 
rein.&#x2033;</ref></p>
 
<p>My reader thinks possibly that the French student was right.</p>
 
<note id="footnote" n="21"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>I should here say, that in the 
catalogue for the 
year just over, (owing, as in cases before mentioned, to the 
zeal and 
enthusiasm of Dr. Aemmester) this, and several other 
pictures, have been 
more completely entered. The work in question is now placed 
in the <hi rend="italic">Sala 
Sessagona</hi>, a room I did not see &#x2014; under the number 
161. It is 
described as &#x2036;Figura mistica di Chiaro dell' 
Erma,&#x2033; and there 
is a brief notice of the author appended.</p></note>

<p>  
THE critic who should undertake to speak of all the poetry 
which issues 
from the press of these present days, what is so called by 
courtesy as well as 
that which may claim the title as of right, would impose on 
himself a task 
demanding no little labor, and entailing no little disgust 
and weariness. Nor is 
the trouble well repaid. More profit will not accrue to him 
who studies, if the 
word can be used, fifty of a certain class of versifiers, 
than to him who 
glances over one: and, while a successful effort to warn 
such that poetry is 
not their proper sphere, and that they must seek elsewhere 
for a vocation to 
work out, might embolden a philanthropist to assume the 
position of 
scare-crow, and drive away the unclean birds from the 
flowers and the green 
leaves; on the other hand, the small results which appear to 
have hitherto 
attended such endeavors are calculated rather to induce 
those who have yet 
made, to relinquish them, than to lead others to follow in 
the same track. It is 
truly a disheartening task. To the critic himself no good, 
though some 
amusement occasionally, can be expected: to the criticised, 
good but rarely, 
for he is seldom convinced, and annoyance and rancour almost 
of course; 
and, even in those few cases where the voice crying "in the 
wilderness" 
produces its effect, the one thistle that abandons the 
attempt at bearing figs 
sees its neighbors still believing in their success, and 
soon has its own place 
filled up. The sentence of those who do not read is the best 
criticism on 
those who will not think.</p>  
 
<p>It is acting on these considerations that we propose not 
to take count of 
any works that do not either show a purpose achieved or give 
promise of a 
worthy event; while of such we hope to overlook none.</p>   
 
<p>We believe it may safely be assumed that at no previous 
period has the 
public been more buzzed round by triviality and 
common-place; but we hold 
firm, at the same time, that at none other has there been a 
greater or a 
grander body of genius, or so honorable a display of well 
cultivated taste and 
talent. Certainly the public do not seem to know this: 
certainly the critics 
deny it, or rather speak as though they never contemplated 
that such a 
position would be advanced; but, if the fact be so, it will 
make itself known, 
and the poets of this day will assert themselves, and take 
their places.</p> 


 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0052" n="35" />


<p>Of these it is our desire to speak truthfully, indeed, 
and without 
compromise, but always as bearing in mind that the inventor 
is more than the 
commentator, and the book more than the notes; and that, if 
it is we who 
speak, we do so not for ourselves, nor as of ourselves.</p>  
 
<p>The work of Arthur Hugh Clough now before us, (we feel 
warranted in 
the dropping of the Mr. even at his first work,) unites the 
most enduring 
forms of nature, and the most unsophisticated conditions of 
life and 
character, with the technicalities of speech, of manners, 
and of persons of an 
Oxford reading party in the long vacation. His hero is</p>  
 
<p>"Philip Hewson, the poet,</p> 
<p>Hewson, the radical hot, hating lords and scorning 
ladies;"</p><p> 
and his heroine is no heroine, but a woman, "Elspie, the 
quiet, the 
brave."</p>  
 
<p>The metre he has chosen, the hexametral, harmonises with 
the spirit of 
primitive simplicity in which the poem is conceived; is 
itself a background, as 
much as are "Knoydart, Croydart, Moydart, Morrer, and 
Ardnamurchan;" 
and gives a new individuality to the passages of familiar 
narrative and every 
day conversation. It has an intrinsic appropriateness; 
although, at first 
thought of the subject, this will, perhaps, be scarcely 
admitted of so old and 
so stately a rhythmical form.</p>  
 
<p>As regards execution, however, there may be noted, in 
qualification of 
much pliancy and vigour, a certain air of experiment in 
occasional passages, 
and a license in versification, which more than warrants a 
warning "to expect 
every kind of irregularity in these modern hexameters." The 
following lines 
defy all efforts at reading in dactyls or spondees, and 
require an almost 
complete transposition of accent.</p>   
 
<p>"There was a point which I forgot, which our gallant 
Highland homes 
have;"&#x2014; </p> 
 
<p>"While the little drunken Piper came across to shake 
hands 
with Lindsay:"&#x2014; </p> 
 
<p>"Something of the world, of men and women: you will not 
refuse me."</p>  
 
<p>In the first of these lines, the omission of the former 
<hi rend="italic">"which,"</hi> 
would remove all objection; and there are others where a 
final syllable 
appears clearly deficient; as thus:&#x2014;</p><p>  
 
"Only the road and larches and ruinous millstead between" 
[<hi rend="italic">them</hi>]:&#x2014; </p><p> 
"Always welcome the stranger: I may say, delighted to see 
[<hi rend="italic">such</hi>]  </p><p> 
Fine young men:"&#x2014; </p><p> 
 
"Nay, never talk: listen now. What I say you can't 
apprehend" 
[<hi rend="italic">yet</hi>]"&#x2014; </p><p> 
 
"Laid her hand on her lap. Philip took it. She did not 
resist" 
[<hi rend="italic">him</hi>]:&#x2014;</p>  
 
<p>Yet the following would be scarcely improved by greater 
exactness:</p>  
 
<p>"Roaring after their prey, do seek their meat from 
God;"</p>  
 
<p>Nor, perhaps, ought this to be made correct:</p> 

 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0053" n="36" />

 
<p>"Close as the bodies and intertwining limbs of athletic 
wrestlers."</p>  
 
<p>The aspect of <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> pervading "the Bothie of 
Toper-na-fuosich,"&#x2014;(<ref target="hut">in English, "the hut 
of 
the bearded well,"</ref> a somewhat singular title, to say 
the least,) is so 
strong and complete as to render necessary the few words of 
dedication, 
where, in inscribing the poem, (or, as the author terms it, 
"trifle,") to his 
"long-vacation pupils," he expresses a hope, that they "will 
not be displeased 
if, in a fiction, purely fiction, they are here and there 
reminded of times 
enjoyed together."</p>  
 
<p>As the story opens, the Oxford party are about to proceed 
to dinner at 
"the place of the Clansmen's meeting." Their characters, 
discriminated with 
the nicest taste, and perfectly worked out, are thus 
introduced:</p>  
 
<p>"Be it recorded in song who was first, who last, in 
dressing.  
Hope was the first, black-tied, white-waistcoated, simple, 
his Honor;  
For the postman made out he was a son to the Earl of Hay,  
(As, indeed, he was to the younger brother, the Colonel);  
Treated him therefore with special respect, doffed bonnet, 
and ever  
Called him his Honor: his Honor he therefore was at the 
cottage;  
Always his Honor at least, sometimes the Viscount of 
Hay.</p> 
 
<p>"Hope was the first, his Honor, and next to his Honor, 
the 
Tutor.   
Still more plain the tutor, the grave man nicknamed Adam,  
White-tied, clerical, silent, with antique square-cut 
waistcoat,  
Formal, unchanged, of black cloth, but with sense and 
feeling beneath it;  
Skilful in ethics and logic, in Pindar and poets unrivalled; 
 
 
<hi rend="italic">Shady</hi> in Latin, said Lindsay, but <hi rend="italic">topping</hi> in 
plays and 
Aldrich.</p><p>  
"Somewhat more splendid in dress, in a waistcoat of a lady,  
 
Lindsay succeeded, the lively, the cheery, cigar-loving 
Lindsay,  
Lindsay the ready of speech, the Piper, the Dialectician:  
This was his title from Adam, because of the words he 
invented,   
Who in three weeks had created a dialect new for the 
party.</p> <p> 
               "Hewson and Hobbes were down at the 
<hi rend="italic">matutine</hi> bathing; 
of course  
Arthur Audley, the bather <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> glory of 
headers:  
Arthur they called him for love and for euphony: so were 
they bathing  
There where in mornings was custom, where, over a ledge of 
granite,   
Into a granite bason descended the amber torrent.  
There were they bathing and dressing: it was but a step from 
the cottage,  
Only the road and larches and ruinous millstead between.  
Hewson and Hobbes followed quick upon Adam; on them followed 
Arthur.</p><p> 
"Airlie descended the last, splendescent as god of Olympus.  
 
When for ten minutes already the fourwheel had stood at the 
gateway;  
He, like a god, came leaving his ample Olympian 
chamber."&#x2014;pp. 5, 6.</p>  
 
<p>A peculiar point of style in this poem, and one which 
gives a certain 
classic character to some of its more familiar aspects, is 
the frequent 
recurrence of the same line, and the repeated definition of 
a personage 


 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0054" n="37" />


by the 
same attributes. Thus, Lindsay is "the Piper, the 
Dialectician," Arthur Audley 
"the glory of headers," and the tutor "the grave man 
nicknamed Adam," from 
beginning to end; and so also of the others.</p>   
 
<p>Omitting the after-dinner speeches, with their</p>   
 
<p>"Long constructions strange and plusquam-Thucydidean,"  
that only of "Sir Hector, the Chief and the Chairman;" in 
honor of the 
Oxonians, than which nothing could be more unpoetically 
truthful, is 
preserved, with the acknowledgment, ending in a sarcasm at 
the game laws, 
by Hewson, who, as he is leaving the room, is accosted by "a 
thin man, clad 
as the Saxon:"</p>  
 
<p>"`Young man, if ye pass thro' the Braes o'Lochaber,</p>  
       <p>See by the Loch-side ye come to the Bothie of 
Toper-na-fuosich.'"&#x2014;p. 9.</p>  
 
<p>Throughout this scene, as through the whole book, no 
opportunity is 
overlooked for giving individuality to the persons 
introduced: Sir Hector, of 
whom we lose sight henceforward, the attache, the Guardsman, 
are not mere 
names, but characters: it is not enough to say that two 
tables were set apart 
"for keeper and gillie and peasant:" there is something to 
be added yet; and 
with other assembled around them were</p>  
 
<p>"Pipers five or six; <hi rend="italic">among them the young one, the 
drunkard</hi>."</p>  
 
<p>The morrow's conversation of the reading party turns on 
"noble ladies 
and rustic girls, their partners." And here speaks out 
Hewson the 
chartist:</p>  
 <p>
<lb/>* * * * * * * * * * * *<lb/> 
</p>
<p> 
"`Never (of course you will laugh, but of course all the 
same I shall say it,  
       Never, believe me, revealed itself to me the sexual 
glory,  
 
Till, in some village fields, in holidays now getting 
stupid,  
One day sauntering long and listless, as Tennyson has it,   
Long and listless strolling, ungainly in hobbydihoyhood,  
Chanced it my eye fell aside on a capless bonnetless maiden, 
 
Bending with three-pronged fork in a garden uprooting 
potatoes.  
Was it the air? who can say? or herself? or the char of the 
labor?  
But a new thing was in me, and longing delicious possessed 
me,  
Longing to take her and lift her, and put her away from her 
slaving.  
Was it to clasp her in lifting, or was it to lift her by 
clasping,  
Was it embracing or aiding was most in my mind? Hard 
question.  
But a new thing was in me: I too was a youth, among maidens. 
 
Was it the air? who can say? But, in part, 'twas the charm 
of the labor.'"</p>  
 
<p>And he proceeds in a rapture to talk on the beauty of 
household 
service.</p>  
<p>Hereat Arthur remarks:</p>  
 
<p>"`Is not all this just the same that one hears at common 
room breakfasts,  
 
Or perhaps Trinity-wines, about Gothic buildings and 
beauty?'"&#x2014;p.13.</p>  



 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0055" n="38" />


<p>The character of Hobbes, called into energy by this 
observation , is perfectly 
developed in the  
lines succeeding:</p><p> 
       "And with a start from the sofa came Hobbes; with a 
cry from 
the sofa,  
There where he lay, the great Hobbes, contemplative, 
corpulent, witty;  
Author forgotten and silent of currentest phrase and fancy;  
Mute and exuberant by turns, a fountain at intervals 
playing,  
Mute and abstracted, or strong and abundant as rain in the 
tropics;  
Studious; careless of dress; inobservant; by smooth 
persuasions  
Lately decoyed into kilt on example of Hope and the Poper,  
 
Hope an Antinous mere, Hyperion of calves the Piper. . . . 
.  
"`Ah! could they only be taught,' he resumed, `by a Pugin of 
women  
How even churning and washing, the dairy, the scullery 
duties,  
Wait but a touch to redeem and convert them to charms and 
attractions;  
Scrubbing requires for true grace but frank and artistical 
handling,   
And the removal of slops to be ornamentally treated!"&#x2014;pp. 
13, 14.</p>  
 
<p>Here, in the tutor's answer to Hewson, we come on the 
moral of the 
poem, a moral to be pursued through commonplace lowliness of 
station and 
through high rank, into the habit of life which would be, in 
the one, not 
petty,&#x2014;in the other, not overweening,&#x2014;in any, calm and 
dignified.</p>  
<p> 
" `You are a boy; when you grow to a man, you'll find things 
alter.  
You will learn to seek the good, to scorn the attractive,  
Scorn all mere cosmetics, as now of rank and fashion,  
Delicate hands, and wealth, so then of poverty also,  
Poverty truly attractive, more truly, I bear you witness.  
Good, wherever found, you will choose, be it humble or 
stately,  
Happy if only you find, and, finding, do not lose it.'"&#x2014;p. 
14.</p>  
 
<p>When the discussion is ended, the party propose to 
separate, some 
proceeding on their tour; and Philip Hewson will be of 
these.</p>  
 
<p>"`Finally, too,' from the kilt and the sofa said Hobbes 
in conclusion,  
`Finally Philip must hunt for that home of the probable 
poacher,  
Hid in the Braes of Lochaber, the Bothie of 
what-did-he-call-it.  
Hopeless of you and of us, of gillies and marquises 
hopeless,  
Weary of ethic and logic, of rhetoric yet more weary,  
There shall he, smit by the charm of a lovely 
potatoe-uprooter,  
Study the question of sex in the Bothie of 
what-did-he-call-it."'&#x2014;p. 18.</p>  
 
<p>The action here becomes divided; and, omitting points of 
detail, we must 
confine ourselves to tracing the development of the idea in 
which the subject 
of the poem consists.</p>  
 
<p>Philip and his companions, losing their road, are 
received at a farm, 
where they stay for three days: and this experience of 
himself begins. He 
comes prepared; and, if he seems to love the "golden-haired 
Katie," it is less 
that she is "the youngest and comeliest daughter" than 
because of her 
position, and that in that she realises his preconceived 
wishes. For three days 
he is with her and about her; and he 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0056" n="39" />
remains when his friends leave the 
farm-house. But his love is no more than the consequence of 
his principles; it 
is his own will unconsidered and but half understood. And a 
letter to Adam 
tells how it had an end:</p>  
<p> 
"`I was walking along some two miles from the cottage,  
Full of my dreamings. A girl went by in a party with others: 
 
She had a cloak on,&#x2014;was stepping on quickly, for rain was 
beginning;  
But, as she passed, from the hood I saw her eyes glance at 
me:&#x2014;  
So quick a glance, so regardless I, that, altho' I felt it,  
You couldn't properly say our eyes met; she cast it, and 
left it.  
It was three minutes, perhaps, ere I knew what it was. I had 
seen her  
Somewhere before, I am sure; but that wasn't it,&#x2014;not its 
import.  
No; it had seemed to regard me with a simple superior 
insight,  
Quietly saying to herself: 'Yes, there he is still in his 
fancy. . . . . .  
Doesn't yet see we have here just the things he is used to 
elsewhere,  
And that the things he likes here, elsewhere he wouldn't 
have looked at;  
People here, too, are people, and not as fairy-land 
creatures.  
He is in a trance, and possessed,&#x2014;I wonder how long to 
continue.  
It is a shame and pity,&#x2014;and no good likely to follow.'&#x2014;  
 
Something like this; but, indeed, I cannot the least define 
it.   
Only, three hours thence, I was off and away in the 
moor-land,  
Hiding myself from myself, if I could, the arrow within 
me.'"&#x2014;p. 29.</p>  
 
<p>Philip Hewson has been going on</p>  
<p> 
"Even as cloud passing subtly unseen from mountain to 
mountain,  
Leaving the crest of Benmore to be palpable next on 
Benvohrlich,  
Or like to hawk of the hill, which ranges and soars in its 
hunting,   
Seen and unseen by turns." . . . . . . And these are his 
words in the 
mountains: . . . . . .</p><p>  
"`Surely the force that here sweeps me along in its violent 
impulse,  
Surely my strength shall be in her, my help and protection 
about her,  
Surely in inner-sweet gladness and vigor of joy shall 
sustain her;  
Till, the brief winter o'erpast, her own true sap in the 
springtide  
Rise, and the tree I have bared be verdurous e'en as 
aforetime:  
Surely it may be, it should be, it must be. Yet, ever and 
ever,   
`Would I were dead,' I keep saying, 'that so I could go and 
uphold her.'"&#x2014;pp. 
26, 27.</p>  
 
<p>And, meanwhile, Katie, among the others, is dancing and 
smiling still on 
some one who is to her all that Philip had ever been.</p>  
 
<p>When Hewson writes next, his experience has reached its 
second stage. 
He is at Balloch, with the aunt and the cousin of his friend 
Hope: and the 
lady Maria has made his beliefs begin to fail and totter, 
and he feels for 
something to hold firmly. He seems to think, at one moment, 
that the mere 
knowledge of the existence of such an one ought to 
compensate for lives of 
drudgery hemmed in with want; then he turns round on himself 
with, "How 
shall that be?" And, at length, he appeases his questions, 
saying that it must 
and should be so, if it is.</p>  
 
<p>After this, come scraps of letters, crossed and 
recrossed, from the 


 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0057" n="40" />


Bothie 
of Toper-na-fuosich. In his travelling towards home, a horse 
cast a shoe, and 
the were directed to David Mackaye. Hewson is still in the 
clachan hard by 
when he urges his friend to come to him: and he comes.</p>  
<p> 
"`There on the blank hill-side, looking down through the 
loch to the ocean;  
 
There, with a runnel beside, and pine-trees twain before it, 
There, with the 
road underneath, and in sight of coaches and steamers, 
Dwelling of David 
Mackaye and his daughters, Elspie and Bella, Sends up a 
column of smoke 
the Bothie of Toper-na-fuosich. . . . .</p>  
<p> 
"So on the road they walk, by the shore of the salt 
sea-water, Silent a youth 
and maid, the elders twain conversing."&#x2014;pp.36, 37.</p>  
<p> 
"Ten more days, with Adam, did Philip abide at the 
changehouse;  Ten more 
nights they met, they walked with father and daughter.  Ten 
more nights; 
and, night by night, more distant away were  Philip and she; 
every night less 
heedful, by habit, the father.&#x2014;pp.38, 39.</p>  
 
<p>From this point, we must give ourselves up to quotation; 
and the narrow 
space remaining to us is our only apology to the reader for 
making any 
omission whatever in these extracts.</p>  
<p> 
"For she confessed, as they sat in the dusk, and he saw not 
her blushes,  
Elspie confessed, at the sports, long ago, with her father, 
she saw him,  
When at the door the old man had told him the name of the 
Bothie;  
There, after that, at the dance; yet again at the dance in 
Rannoch;  
And she was silent, confused. Confused much rather Philip  
Buried his face in his hands, his face that with blood was 
bursting.  
Silent, confused; yet by pity she conquered here fear, and 
continued:  
`Katie is good and not silly: be comforted, Sir, about her;  
Katie is good and not silly; tender, but not, like many,  
Carrying off, and at once, for fear of being seen, in the 
bosom  
Locking up as in a cupboard, the pleasure that any man gives 
them,  
Keeping it out of sight as a prize they need to be ashamed 
of :  
That is the way, I think, Sir, in England more than in 
Scotland.  
No; she lives and takes pleasure in all, as in beautiful 
weather;  
Sorry to lose it; but just as we would be to lose fine 
weather. . . . .  
There were at least five or six,&#x2014;not there; no, that I 
don't say,  
But in the country about,&#x2014;you might just as well have been 
courting.  
 
That was what gave me much pain; and (you won't remember 
that tho'),  
Three days after, I met you, beside my Uncle's walking;  
And I was wondering much, and hoped you wouldn't notice;  
So, as I passed, I couldn't help looking. You didn't know 
me;  
But I was glad when I heard, next day, you were gone to the 
teacher.'  
"And, uplifting his face at last, with eyes dilated,  
Large as great stars in mist, and dim with dabbled lashes.  
Philip, with new tears starting,</p>  
 
<p>`You think I do not remember,'  
 
Said, `suppose that I did not observe. Ah me! shall I tell 
you?  
Elspie, it was your look that sent me away from Rannoch.' . 
. . .   
And he continued more firmly, altho' with stronger emotion.  
`Elspie, why should I speak it? You cannot believe it, and 
should not.  
Why should I say that I love, which I all but said to 
another? 



 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0058" n="41" />


 
Yet, should I dare, should I say, Oh Elspie you only I love, 
you,  
First and sole in my life that has been, and surely that 
shall be;  
Could, oh could, you believe it, oh Elspie, believe it, and 
spurn not?  
Is it possible,&#x2014;possible, Elspie?'  
 
</p><p>`Well,' she answered,  
 
Quietly, after her fashion, still knitting; `Well, I think 
of it.  
 
Yes, I don't know, Mr. Philip; but only it feels to me 
strangely,  
Like to the high new bridge they used to build at, below 
there,  
Over the burn and glen, on the road. You won't understand 
me. . . . .  
Sometimes I find myself dreaming at nights about arches and 
bridges;  
Sometimes I dream of a great invisible hand coming down, and 
 
Dropping a great key-stone in the middle.' . . . .   
 
</p><p>"But while she was speaking&#x2014;  
 
So it happened,&#x2014;a moment she paused from her work, and, 
pondering,  
Laid her hand on her lap. Philip took it, she did not 
resist.   
So he retained her fingers, the knitting being stopped. But 
emotion  
Came all over her more and more, from his hand, from her 
heart, and   
Most from the sweet idea and image her brain was renewing.  
So he retained her hand, and, his tears down-dropping on it, 
 
Trembling a long time, kissed it at last: and she ended.  
And, as she ended, up rose he, saying: `What have I heard? 
Oh!  
What have I done, that such words should be said to me? Oh! 
I see it,  
See the great key-stone coming down from the heaven of 
heavens.'  
And he fell at her feet, and buried his face in her apron.  
"But, as, under the moon and stars, they went to the 
cottage,  
Elspie sighed and said: 'Be patient, dear Mr. Philip;  
Do not do anything hasty. It is all so soon, so sudden.  
Do not say anything yet to any one.'  
 
</p><p>`Elspie,' he answered,  
 
"Does not my friend go on Friday? I then shall see nothing 
of you:  
Do not I myself go on Monday? 'But oh!' he said, 'Elspie,  
Do as I bid you, my child; do not go on calling me 
<hi rend="italic">Mr</hi>.  
Might I not just as well be calling you <hi rend="italic">Miss Elspie</hi>?  
Call me, this heavenly night, for once, for the first time, 
Philip.'  
"`Philip,' she said, and laughed, and said she could not say 
it.  
`Philip,' she said. He turned, and kissed the sweet lips as 
they said it.  
"But, on the morrow, Elspie kept out of the way of Philip;  
And, at the evening seat, when he took her hand by the 
alders,  
Drew it back, saying, almost peevishly:  
 
</p><p>"`No, Mr. Philip;  
 
I was quite right last night: it is too soon, too sudden,  
What I told you before was foolish, perhaps,&#x2014;was hasty.  
When I think it over, I am shocked and terrified at it.'" . 
. . .  
"Ere she had spoken two words, had Philip released her 
fingers;  
 
As she went on, he recoiled, fell back, and shook, and 
shivered.  
There he stood, looking pale and ghastly; when she had 
ended,  
 
Answering in a hollow voice:  
 
</p><p>"`It is true; oh! quite true, Elspie.  
 
Oh! you are always right; oh! what, what, have I been doing? 
 
I will depart to-morrow. But oh! forget me not wholly,  
Wholly, Elspie, nor hate me; no, do not hate me, my 
Elspie.'"  


 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0059" n="42" />


"But a revulsion passed thro' the brain and bosom of Elspie; 
 
And she got up from her seat on the rock, putting by her 
knitting,   
Went to him where he stood, and answered:   
 
   "`No, Mr. Philip:   
 
No; you are good, Mr. Philip, and gentle; and I am the 
foolish:   
No, Mr. Philip; forgive me.'  
 
   "She stepped right to him, and boldly   
 
Took up his hand, and placed it in her's, he daring no 
movement;   
Took up the cold hanging hand, up-forcing the heavy elbow.  
 
`I am afraid,' she said; `but I will;' and kissed the 
fingers.   
And he fell on his knees, and kissed her own past counting. 
. . . . .   
 
"As he was kissing her fingers, and knelt on the ground 
before her,   
Yielding, backward she sank to her seat, and, of what she 
was doing   
Ignorant, bewildered, in sweet multitudinous vague emotion,  
 
Stooping, knowing not what, put her lips to the curl on his 
forehead.   
And Philip, raising himself, gently, for the first time, 
round her   
Passing his arms, close, close, enfolded her close to his 
bosom.   
"As they went home by the moon, `Forgive me, Philip,' she 
whispered:   
`I have so many things to talk of all of a sudden,   
I who have never once thought a thing in my ignorant 
Highlands.'"  
[pp. 39-44.</p>  
<p>We may spare criticism here, for what reader will not 
have felt such 
poetry? There is something in this of the very tenderness of 
tenderness; this 
is true delicacy, fearless and unembarrassed. Here it seems 
almost captious 
to object: perhaps, indeed, it is rather personal whim than 
legitimate criticism 
which makes us take some exception at "the curl on his 
forehead;" yet 
somehow there seems a hint in it of the pet curate.</p>  
<p>Elspie's doubts now return upon her with increased force; 
and it is not 
till after many  
conversations with the "teacher" that she allows her resolve 
to be fixed. So, 
at last,</p><p>  
"There, upon Saturday eve, in the gorgeous bright October,  
Under that 
alders knitting, gave Elspie her troth to Philip."</p><p>   
And, after their talk, she feels strong again, and fit to be 
his.&#x2014;Then they rise.  
"`But we must go, Mr. Philip.' "`I shall not go at all,' 
said  He, `If you call me 
<hi rend="italic">Mr</hi>. Thank Heaven! that's well over!'  "`No, but it's 
not,' she said; `it 
is not over, nor will be.   
Was it not, then,' she asked, `the name I called you first 
by?   
No, Mr. Philip, no. You have kissed me enough for two 
nights.   
No.&#x2014;Come, Philip, come, or I'll go myself without you.'  
"`You never call me Philip,' he answered, `until I kiss 
you.'"&#x2014;pp. 47, 48.</p>  
<p>David Mackaye gives his consent; but first Hewson must 
return to 
College, and study for a  
year.</p>   
<p>His views have not been stationary. To his old scorn for 
the idle of 


 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0060" n="43" />

the 
earth had succeeded the surprise that overtook him at 
Balloch: and he would 
now hold to his creed, yet not as rejecting his experience. 
Some, he says, 
were made for use; others for ornament; but let these be so 
<hi rend="italic">made</hi>, of 
a truth, and not such as find themselves merely thrust into 
exemption from 
labor. Let each know his place, and take it,</p>   
<p>"For it is beautiful only to do the thing we are meant 
for."  
And of his friend urging Providence he can only, while 
answering that 
doubtless he must be in the right, ask where the limit comes 
between 
circumstance and Providence, and can but wish for a great 
cause, and the 
trumpet that should call him to God's battle, whereas he 
sees</p><p> 
"Only infinite jumble and mess and dislocation,  Backed by 
a solemn appeal,  
For God's sake, do not stir there.'"  
And the year is now out.  
"Philip returned to his books, but returned to his Highlands 
after. . . .   
There in the bright October, the gorgeous bright October,   
When the brackens are changed, and heather blooms are faded, 
 
 
And, amid russet of heather and fern, green trees are 
bonnie,   
There, when shearing had ended, and barley-stooks were 
garnered,   
David gave Philip to wife his daughter, his darling Elspie;  
 
Elspie, the quiet, the brave, was wedded to Philip, the 
poet. . . . .   
So won Philip his bride. They are married, and gone to New 
Zealand.   
Five hundred pounds in pocket, with books and two or three 
pictures,   
Tool-box, plough, and the rest, they rounded the sphere to 
New Zealand.   
There he hewed and dug; subdued the earth and his 
spirit."&#x2014;pp. 52-55.</p> 
 
<p>Among the prominent attributes of this poem is its 
completeness. The 
elaboration, not only of character and of mental discipline, 
but of incident 
also, is unbroken. The absences of all mention of Elspie in 
the opening scene 
and again at the dance at Rannoch may at first seem to be a 
failure in this 
respect; but second thoughts will show it to be far 
otherwise: for, in the 
former case, her presence would not have had any 
significance for Hewson, 
and, in the latter, would have been overlooked by him save 
so far as might 
warrant a future vague recollection, pre-occupied as his 
eyes and thoughts 
were by another. There is one condition still under which we 
have as yet had 
little opportunity of displaying this quality ; but it will 
be found to be as fully 
carried out in the descriptions of nature. In the first of 
our extracts the 
worlds are few, but stand for many.</p>  
<p> 
"Me_ly glen, the heart of Lochiel's fair forest,  
Where Scotch firs are darkest and amplest, and intermingle  
Grandly with rowan and ash;&#x2014;in  
Mar you have no ashes;  
There the pine is alone or relieved by birch and alder."&#x2014;p. 
22.</p>  
       <p>In the next mere sound and the names go far 
towards the 
entire effect; 
but not so far as to induce any negligence in essential 
details:</p><p>   
"As, at return of tide, the total weight of ocean,  
Drawn by moon and sun from Labrador and Greenland, 



 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0061" n="44" />


Sets in amain in the open space betwixt Mull and Scarfa,  
Heaving, swelling, spreading, the might of the mighty 
Atlantic;  
There into cranny and slit of the rocky cavernous bottom   
Settles down; and with dimples huge the smooth sea-surface  
Eddies, coils, and whirls, and dangerous Corryvreckan."&#x2014;p. 
52.</p>  
<p>Two more passages, and they must suffice as examples. 
Here the 
isolation is perfect; but it is the isolation, not of the 
place and the actors only; 
it is, as it were, almost our own in an equal degree;</p><p>  
   "Ourselves too seeming  
Not as spectators, accepted into it, immingled, as truly   
Part of it as are the kine of the field lying there by the 
birches."  
"There, across the great rocky wharves a wooden bridge goes, 
 
 
Carrying a path to the forest; below,&#x2014;three hundred yards, 
say,&#x2014;  
Lower in level some twenty-five feet, thro' flats of 
shingle,   
Stepping-stones and a cart-track cross in the open valley.  
But, in the interval here, the boiling pent-up water  
Frees itself by a final descent, attaining a bason  
Ten feet wide and eighteen long, with whiteness and fury  
Occupied partly, but mostly pellucid, pure, a mirror;  
Beautiful there for the color derived from green rocks 
under;  
Beautiful most of all where beads of foam uprising  
Mingle their clouds of white with the delicate hue of the 
stillness.  
Cliff over cliff for its sides, with rowan and pendent 
birch-boughs,   
Here it lies, unthought of above at the bridge and pathway,  
Still more concealed from below by wood and rocky 
projection.  
You are shut in, left alone with yourself and perfection of 
water,  
Hid on all sides, left alone with yourself and the goddess 
of bathing."&#x2014;  
</p><p>"So they bathed, they read, they roamed in glen and 
forest;  
Far amid blackest pines to the waterfall they shadow,  
Far up the long long glen to the loch, and the loch beyond 
it  
Deep under huge red cliffs, a secret."</p>  
<p>In many of the images of this poem, as also in the volume 
<ref target="ambarvalia" n="26">"Ambarvalia,"</ref> the joint production 
of  
Clough and <ref target="burbidge" n="27">Thomas Burbidge</ref>, 
there is a peculiar moderness, a reference distinctly to the 
means and habits  
of society in these days, a recognition of every-day fact, 
and a willingness to 
believe it as capable of poetry as that which, but for 
having once been fact, 
would not now be tradition. There is a certain special 
character in passages 
like the following, the familiarity of the matter blending 
with the remoteness 
of the form of metre, such as should not be overlooked in 
attempting to 
estimate the author's mind and views of art:</p>  
<p>"Still, as before (and as now), balls, dances, and 
evening parties, . . . 
. 
Seemed like a sort of unnatural up-in-the-air balloon work, 
. . . .   
As mere gratuitous trifling in presence of business and 
duty  
As does the turning aside of the tourist to look at a 
landscape  
Seem in the steamer or coach to the merchant in haste for 
the city."&#x2014;[p. 12.</p><p>  
"I was as one that sleeps on the railway; one who, 
dreaming,


 <pb entity="DSSR_000002622_0062" n="45" />



Hears thro' his dream the name of his home shouted 
out.&#x2014;hears and hears 
not, 
Faint, and louder again, and less loud, dying in 
distance,&#x2014; 
Dimly conscious, with something of inward debate and choice, 
and 
Sense of [present] claim and reality present; relapses, 
Nevertheless, and continues the dream and fancy, while 
forward, 
Swiftly, remorseless, the car presses on, he knows not 
whither."&#x2014;p. 38.</p>  
<p>Indeed, the general adaptation of the style to the 
immediate matter, the 
alternation of the poetic and the familiar, with a certain 
mixture even of 
classical phrase and allusion, is highly appropriate, and 
may almost be termed 
constant, except in occasional instances where more poetry, 
and especially 
more conception and working out of images, is introduced 
than squares with 
a strict observance of nature. Thus the lines quoted where 
Elspie applies to 
herself the incident of "the high new bridge" and "the great 
key-stone in the 
middle" are succeeded by others (omitted in our extract) 
where the idea is 
followed into its details; and there is another passage in 
which, through no 
less than seventeen lines, she compares herself to an inland 
stream disturbed 
and hurried on by the mingling with it of the sea's tide. 
Thus also one of the 
most elaborate descriptions in the poem,&#x2014;an episode in 
itself of the 
extremest beauty and finish, but, as we  
think, clearly misplaced,&#x2014;is a picture of the dawn over a 
great city, 
introduced into a letter of Philip's, and that, too, simply 
as an image of his 
own mental condition. There are but few poets for whom it 
would be 
superfluous to reflect whether pieces of such-like mere 
poetry might not 
more properly form part of the descriptive groundwork, and 
be altogether 
banished from discourse and conversation, where the greater 
amount of their 
intrinsic care and excellence becomes, by its position, a 
proportionally 
increasing load of disregard for truthfulness.</p>  
<p>For a specimen of a peculiarly noble spirit which 
pervades the whole 
work, we would refer the reader to the character of Arthur 
Audley, 
unnecessary to the story, but most important to the 
sentiment; for a 
comprehensive instance of minute feeling for individuality, 
to the narrative of 
Lindsay and the corrections of Arthur on returning from 
their tour.</p>  
<p>"He to the great <hi rend="italic">might have been</hi> upsoaring, 
sublime and ideal;</p> 
<p>He to the merest <hi rend="italic">it was</hi> restricting, diminishing, 
dwarfing;"  
For pleasant ingenuity, involving, too, a point of 
character, to the final letter 
of Hobbes to Philip, wherein, in a manner made up of playful 
subtlety and 
real poetical feeling, he proves how "this Rachel and Leah 
is marriage."</p>  
<p>"The Bothie of Toper-na-fuosich" will not, it is to be 
feared, be 
extensively read; its length combined with the metre in 
which it is written, or 
indeed a first hasty glance at the contents, does not allure 
the

majority even 
of poetical readers; but it will not be left or forgotten by 
such as fairly enter 
upon it. This is a poem essentially thought and studied, if 
not while in the act 
of writing, at least as the result of a condition of mind; 
and the author owes 
it to the appreciations of all into whose hands it shall 
come, and who are 
willing to judge for themselves, to call it, should a second 
edition appear, by 
its true name;&#x2014;not a trifle, but a work.</p>  
<p>That public attention should have been so little engaged 
by this poem is a 
fact in one respect somewhat remarkable, as contrasting with 
the notice 
which the "Ambarvalia" has received. Nevertheless, 
independently of the 
greater importance of "the Bothie" in length and 
development, it must, we 
think, be admitted to be written on sounder and more matured 
principles of 
taste,&#x2014;the style being sufficiently characterized and 
distinctive without 
special prominence, whereas not a few of the poems in the 
other volume are 
examples rather of style than of thought, and might be held 
in recollection on 
account of the former quality alone.</p>

"My Beautiful Lady" and "Of my Lady In Death" were probably 
some of 
Woolner's first poems, written at the urging of Dante 
Gabriel Rossetti. He 
later revised and included them in his three-part sequence 
<hi rend="italic">My Beautiful 
Lady</hi>, first published by Macmillan in 1863. It went 
through two more 
editions (1864 and 1866) and was also included in a combined 
edition, 
<hi rend="italic">My Beautiful Lady and Nelly Dale</hi>, published in 1887  
as volume 82 of Cassell's National Library.</p>
<p>According to Ormond, these two early poems have "a 
deliberate and often 
delightful naivete of style which was abandoned in 
&#x005B;Woolner's&#x005D; more mature 
poetry" (<hi rend="italic">Tennyson and Thomas Woolner</hi>, 1981).</p>

Boccaccio's reputed mistress and muse, Maria d'Aquino. 
She was the 
daughter of the Count and Countess of Aquino, but was 
rumored to have 
been fathered by Robert of Anjou, King of Naples.</p><p> 
When Maria's parents died during her infancy, she was sent 
to live with 
relatives at the Benedictine convent of St. Michele at Baia. 
She married an 
Italian nobleman on the condition that she could return to 
life at the convent 
if she so desired, which she did.</p><p> 
 
According to the legend (which sounds remarkably like 
Petrarch's encounter 
with Laura), Boccaccio first encountered the married Maria 
d'Aquino 
around 1338 at the Church of San Lorenzo in Naples on Holy 
Saturday 
before Easter. It was love at first sight, and Boccaccio was 
so overcome he 
could not speak. </p><p> 
 
Their second encounter occured at the convent, where 
Boccaccio was 
visiting a friend. Maria asked him to retell the rude French 
tale "Florie et 
Blancheflor" in Italian as a courtly romance. Boccaccio 
produced 
"Filocopo," dedicated to "La Fiametta," (little flame) his 
nickname for Maria. 
This effort apparently convinced her to become Boccaccio's 
mistress; the 
affair lasted less than two years, ending when Maria took 
another lover. </p><p> 
       Boccaccio dedicated "Teseide" and "Filostrato" to 
<hi rend="italic">La 
Fiametta</hi>. She 
is the heroine of his "Ameto" and "La Fiametta," and appears 
in "Amorosa 
Visione," "La Caccia di Diana," and "Ninfale 
Fiesolano."</p></note>

<p>John Lucas Tupper felt strongly that art 
education had 
degenerated to 
the point where those educated  
under the current system were unable to distinguish good art 
from bad. He 
called for the  
reform of art education throughout his career, particularly 
in his book 
<hi rend="italic">Hiatus, or the Void  
in Modern Education</hi> (Macmillan, 1896). The first and 
third issues of 
<hi rend="italic">The Germ</hi> provided  
Tupper with his first public outlet for these ideas, 
although, as William 
Michael Rossetti  
noted in the preface to the 1901 facsimile, Tupper's 
argument is somewhat 
murky: </p> 
 
<p>Mr. Tupper was, for an artist, a man of unusually 
scientific mind; yet he 
was not, I think,  
distinguished by that power of orderly and progressive 
exposition which 
befits an  
argument(16).</p> 
 
<p>WMR also issues a cautionary note in his preface that 
&#x00BB;The 
views expressed 
by Mr.  
Tupper in these two papers should be regarded as his own, 
and not by any means necessarily those upheld by the Pre-Raphaelite 
Brotherhood&#x00AB;(17).</p></note>

Christina Rossetti composed "Dream Land" in April of 
1849.  
It was first printed in <hi rend="italic">The Germ</hi> under the name 
"Ellen Alleyn,"  
a pseudonym created by Dante Gabriel Rossetti. William

              <hi rend="bold">sleep</hi><lb/> 
Christina Rossetti, a devout Tractarian, subscribed to 
the doctrine 
known as <hi rend="italic">Soul Sleep</hi>. Soul Sleep refers to a "waiting 
time" between 
the death and the reunion of the soul and body on the Last 
Day. During this 
waiting period, it was believed that the soul enters a 
suspended state outside 
of time and awareness. Only on the Last Day does the soul 
awake and 
receive its eternal reward. This doctrine is in marked 
contrast to traditional 
Christian views which hold that the soul recieves its 
eternal reward at death. </p> 
<p>For a more detailed discussion of Soul Sleep, see Jerome 
J. McGann's "The 
Religious Poetry of Christina Rossetti." in <hi rend="italic">Critical 
Inquiry.</hi> 10:1 
(Sept. 1983), 127-144.</p>

<div1 type="note" id="d26"> 
<head>Songs of one Household<lb/> 
(My Sister's Sleep)</head> 
 <note id="intro6" n="10"> 
<p>In his 1889 study of his brother, William Michael Rossetti 
says that "My 
Sister's Sleep" was first published in <hi rend="italic">The New Monthly 
Belle 
Assemblee</hi> in 1847 or 1848, but he later concludes that 
Dante Gabriel 
Rossetti's attempts to have it published there were 
unsuccessful.  However, 
the poem did appear anonymously in the <hi rend="italic">Belle 
Assemblee</hi> for 
September 1848 with a critique by Elizabeth Youatt. (See 
Bentley in 
<hi rend="italic">Victorian Poetry</hi> 12 &#x005B;1974&#x005D; for the <hi rend="italic">Belle

<p>The poem therefore makes its second, not first,

in the 1850 
<hi rend="italic">Germ</hi>. Despite its larger title, "Songs of One 
Household," William

<div1 type="note" id="d27"><head>Hand and Soul</head><note id="nintro7" n="11"> 

 
<p>Although the Germ does not contain a declarative 
statement of the 
Pre-Raphaelites' creed, many critics have argued that "Hand 
and Soul" is 
Dante Rossetti's Pre-Raphaelite manifesto.  Even William 
Michael Rossetti 
believed his brother's short story contained the creed for 
the movement. 
In his introduction to the 1901 edition of the Germ, William 
Michael 
Rossetti wrote:</p> 
 
<p>Though the form of this tale is that of romantic 
metaphor, 
its substance 
is a very serious manifesto of art dogma.  It amounts 
to saying, the only satisfactory works of art are those 
which exhibit the 
very soul of the artist.  To work for fame or self-display 
is a failure; 
but to paint that which your own perceptions and emotions 
urge you to paint 
promises to be a success for yourself, and hence a benefit 
to a mass of 
beholders.  This was the core of the 'Pre-Raphaelite' creed; 
with the 
adjunct ... that the artist cannot attain adequate 
self-expression save 
through a stern study and realization of natural 
appearances. &#x005B;Link to 
citation in appendix &#x2014; as soon as we have it 
up?(p18-19)&#x005D;</p> 
 
<p>"Hand and Soul" not only offers its readers insight into 
the 
artistic 
intentions of Rossetti and the PRB, but as many critics have 
argued, the 
story is significant for research into many areas of study.  
"Hand and 
Soul" can be read as autobiography and self-prophecy, as an 
important 
turning-point in nineteenth century short fiction, and as a 
pre-cursor to 
Pater, Wilde, the Aesthetic movement and Decadence.  D.M.R. 
Bentley has 
argued that the changes Rossetti made to the story for later 
publication 
provide "evidence... of Rossetti's youthful fascination with 
Catholicism 
and... of his later tendency to de-Catholicize the 
atmosphere of his early 
work" ("Rossetti's 'Hand and Soul.'" <hi rend="italic">English Studies in 
Canada</hi> III, 4, 
Winter 1977,447).  Changes made to later publications of the 
story have 
been noted to aid the reader in coming to his or her own 
conclusions in 
this matter.</p></note>

Chiaro, Dr. Aemmster, and many of the other seemingly 
historical 
figures in the story  
are fictitious.  As William Michael Rossetti explained in 
his introduction  
to the 1901 facsimile of <hi rend="italic">The Germ:</hi> "All about Chiaro 
dell' Erma 
himself, Dresden and Dr. Aemmster, D'Agincourt, pictures at 
the Pitti 
Gallery, the author's visit to Florence in  
1847, etc., are pure inventions or 'mystifications'; but so 
realistically  
put that they have in various instances been relied upon and 
cited as  
truths." (19) </p><p> 
Pfordresher describes "Chiaro" and other names in the story 
as a  
"quasi-allegorical . . . playing on Italian roots."  He 
explains that  
"'Chiaro' means clear, bright, transparent (in reference to 
color), and  
serves as a punning allusion to the brightness and clarity 
of  
Pre-Raphaelite pictures.  Erma comes from 'Ermies'/ Hermes 
Mercury,  
messenger from the gods, with a probable play on 'ermetico' 
&#x2014;airtight, the  
artist sealed off from light" (115). According to 
Pfordresher, "Dr.  
Aemmster" also puns.  "In German an 'Amme' is a wet nurse or 
(if one

<hi rend="italic">The Bothie of Toper-na-fuosich</hi><lb/>
 
The Bothie of Toper-na-Fuosich was first published in 
November, 1848.  
Written in 
hexameters after Longfellow's taming of "our 
forward-rushing, 
consonant-crushing, 
Anglo-savage enunciation" in <hi rend="italic">Evangeline</hi> (1847), the 
poem recounts 
a student reading 
party in Scotland.</p> 
 
<p>Philip falls in love with a peasant girl, Elspie, but 
unable to find a place 
in English society, 
"they rounded the globe to New Zealand." </p> 
 
<p>English critics generally ridiculed the poem.  Unsigned 
reviews in the 
<hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> and 
the <hi rend="italic">Literary Gazette</hi> perhaps reflected a philistine 
resentment of 
Oxonians: "at first view 
<hi rend="italic">The Bothie of Toper-na-Fuosich</hi> looked like some 
Oxford satire; but 
if it does cover any 
occult meaning, it is confined to the initiated" 
(<hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>, 2 
December 1848).  More 
sophisticated readers&#x2014;among them W. M. Thackeray, Elizabeth 
Barrett 
Browning, and Charles 
Kingsley&#x2014;praised the poem, but the most enthusiastic 
reception came from 
the United States.  In 
his critique for the <hi rend="italic">Massachusetts Quarterly Review</hi> 
(March 1849), 
Emerson declared that 
"the poem has great literary merits . . . . The Homeric 
iteration has a singular 
charm . . . and there 
is a wealth of expression, a power of description and of 
portrait-painting, 
which excels out best 
romancers." </p> 
 
<p>Matthew Arnold, perhaps Clough's closest friend, 
initially derided the 
poem for sounding 
"more American than English," but tempered his criticism to 
concede in 
1861 that Clough's 
"composition produces a sense in the reader which Homer's 
composition 
produces."</p>   
 
<p>Of his review in <hi rend="italic">The Germ,</hi>William Michael Rossetti 
wrote in the 
preface of the 
1901 reprint: "The only remark which I need make on this 
somewhat 
ponderous article is that I, 
as editor of <hi rend="italic">The Germ</hi>, was more or less expected to 
do the sort of 
work for which other 
'proprietors' had little inclination."  Yet he did report 
that, in response to the 
review, "I had a 
letter from Clough, conveying his thanks to me for the copy 
of <hi rend="italic">The 
Germ</hi>, and the 
criticism" (<hi rend="italic">PRB Journal</hi>, 27 January 1850).</p> 
 
<p><hi rend="bold">Arthur Hugh Clough</hi>  
<lb/> 
Clough (1819-1861), the son of a Liverpool cotton merchant, 
was Dr. 
Thomas Arnold's prize pupil at Rugby.  He became a scholar 
at Balliol 
College, where he took a second and told Dr. Arnold in June 
1841 "I have 
failed."  He became a fellow of Oriel, but resigned. Then he 
 
was made principal of University Hall, London, as an 
examiner in the 
examination office, but  
was eventually forced to resign there as well.   Clough was 
continually 
plagued by doubts religious and otherwise, particularly when 
his experience 
at Oxford challenged his indoctrination at Rugby.  The 
poetry published 
during his lifetime, "The Bothie" and <hi rend="italic">Ambarvalia</hi>, was 
for the most 
part poorly received in England.  With this in mind he 
published his 
epistolary <hi rend="italic">Amours de Voyage</hi> in the United States 
only.  (It appeared 
anonymously in the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi>, 1858). He died 
in Florence, 
and Matthew Arnold wrote "Thyrsis" to commemorate his death. 
</p></note> 
  
<note id="hut"><p><hi rend="bold">(in English, 'the hut of the bearded 
well')</hi><lb/>
 
In September 1847 Clough stayed at the Bothie of Tobair 
na Feosag, a 
forester's cottage about six miles from the head of Loch 
Ericht, on the west 
shore of Scotland.  Clough was told by the boatman on Loch 
Ericht that the 
name was really "Toper-na-Fuosich," meaning "the baird's 
well."  While 
William Michael Rossetti's translation of "the bearded well" 
refers to Tobair 
na Feosag, Clough's title is actually a bawdy Gaelic toast.  
A reviewer in the 
<hi rend="italic">Literary Gazette</hi> for 18 August 1849, quipped that 
"the author ought 
to have been more guarded against the malicious Gael who 
imposed it on the 
inquisitive Sassenach."  Soon afterward, Clough discovered 
his error and 
wrote to William Allingham in 1855, that "I was so disgusted 
with the 
mishap of the name, that I have never had pleasure in &#x005B;the 
poem&#x005D; since."  To 
fit the meter he experimented with "The Bothie of 
Toper-na-Kippoch" and 
later, "The Bothie of Tober-na-Vuolich," a change he 
registered throughout 
the poem's 1862 edition.  Clough had also tried  
"Tober-navohlich" and 
"Topernafasach," finally deciding that only "The Bothie" 
should appear on 
the title page.</p></note> 
  
<note id="ambarvalia" n="26"><p><hi rend="bold">Ambarvalia</hi><lb/> 
A joint publication with Thomas Burbidge, <hi rend="italic">Ambarvalia 
</hi>is a 
collection of thirty-two short lyrics and blank-verse 
fragments which 
appeared in January 1849.  It was often referred to in 
Clough's letters as the 
<hi rend="italic">Sicilian Shepherd</hi>.  Contemporary critics tended to 
prefer Burbidge's 
contributions to Clough's, generally citing the obscurity of 
the latter as the 
reason. </p></note>   
  
<note id="burbidge" n="27"><p><hi rend="bold">Thomas Burbidge</hi><lb/> 
As William Michael Rossetti's review indicates, this 
now-forgotten poet 
is perhaps best known for his collaboration with Clough on 
<hi rend="italic">Ambarvalia.</hi> Burbidge (1816-1892) was Clough's 
schoolfellow at 
Rugby, which he attended 1830-1834.  His mischievousness 
attracted the 
lifelong friendship of Clough, who in adulthood would 
regularly send him 
drafts of poems.  When Burbidge left for Trinity College, 
Cambridge (where 
he took his BA in 1841) Clough would often arrange to meet 
him at Rugby.  
After taking his LL.D, Burbidge was made headmaster at 
Leamington 
College 1851-1857, after which he became Chaplain at Malta, 
and later, 
Palermo.</p></note>
