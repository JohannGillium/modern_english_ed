        <head>CHAPTER I</head>

        <p>PAUL KEGWORTHY lived with his mother, Mrs. Button, his stepfather, Mr. Button,
          and six little Buttons, his half brothers and sisters. His was not an ideal
          home; it consisted in a bedroom, a kitchen and a scullery in a grimy little
          house in a grimy street made up of rows of exactly similar grimy little houses,
          and forming one of a hundred similar streets in a northern manufacturing town.
          Mr. and Mrs. Button worked in a factory and took in as lodgers grimy single men
          who also worked in factories. They were not a model couple; they were rather, in
          fact, the scandal of Budge Street, which did not itself enjoy, in Bludston, a
          reputation for holiness. Neither was good to look upon. Mr. Button, who was
          Lancashire bred and born, divided the yearnings of his spirit between strong
          drink and dog-fights. Mrs. Button, a viperous Londoner, yearned for noise. When
          Mr. Button came home drunk he punched his wife about the head and kicked her
          about the body, while they both exhausted the vocabulary of vituperation of
          North and South, to the horror and edification of the neighbourhood. When Mr.
          Button was sober Mrs. Button chastised little Paul. She would have done so when
          Mr. Button was drunk, but she had not the time. The periods, therefore, of his
          mother's martyrdom were those of Paul's enfranchisement. If he saw his
          stepfather <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0021" n="10"/> come down the street with
          steady gait, he fled in terror; if he saw him reeling homeward he lingered about
          with light and joyous heart. </p>
        <p>The brood of young Buttons was fed spasmodically and clad at random, but their
          meals were regular and their raiment well assorted compared with Paul's.
          Naturally they came in for clouts and thumps like all the children in Budge
          Street; it was only Paul who underwent organized chastisement. The little
          Buttons often did wrong; but in the mother's eyes Paul could never do right. In
          an animal way she was fond of the children of Button, and in a way equally
          animal she bore a venomous dislike to the child of Keg-worthy. Who and what
          Kegworthy had been neither Paul nor any inhabitant of Bludston knew. Once the
          boy inquired, and she broke a worn frying-pan over his head. Kegworthy, whoever
          he might have been, was wrapt in mystery. She had appeared in the town when Paul
          was a year old, giving herself out as a widow. That she was by no means
          destitute was ob-vious from the fact that she at once rented the house in Budge
          Street, took in lodgers, and lived at her ease. Button, who was one of the
          lodgers, cast upon her the eyes of desire and married her. Why she married
          Button she could never determine. Perhaps she had a romantic idea-and there is
          romance even in Budge Street-that Button would support her. He very soon
          shattered any such illusion by appropriating the remainder of her fortune and
          kicking her into the factory with hobnailed boots. It would be wrong to say that
          Mrs. Button did not complain; she did. She tent the air of Budge Street with
          horrible execration; but she went to the factory, where, save for the intervals
          of retirement rendered necessary by the births of the little Buttons, she was
          contented enough to stay. </p>
        <p>If Paul Kegworthy had been of the same fibre as <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0022" n="11"/> the little Buttons, he would have felt,
          thought and acted as they, and this history would never have been written. He
          would have grown up to man's estate in the factory and have been merged an
          indistinguishable unit in the drab mass of cloth-capped humans who, at certain
          hours of the day, flood the streets of Bludston, and swarm on the roofs of
          clanging and shrieking tramcars, and on Saturday afternoons gather in clotted
          greyness on the football ground. He might have been sober and industrious-the
          proletariat of Bludston is not entirely composed of Buttons-but he would have
          taken the colour of his environment, and the world outside Bludston would never
          have heard of him. Paul, however, differed greatly from the little Buttons.
          They, children of the grey cap and the red shawl, resembled hundreds of
          thousands of little human rabbits similarly parented. Only the trained eye could
          have identified them among a score or two of their congeners. For the most part,
          they were dingily fair, with snub noses, coarse mouths, and eyes of an
          indeterminate blue. Of that type, once blowsily good-looking, was Mrs. Button
          herself. But Paul wandered a changeling about the Bludston streets. In the rows
          of urchins in the crowded Board School classroom he sat as conspicuous as any
          little Martian who might have been bundled down to earth. He had wavy black
          hair, of raven black, a dark olive complexion, flushed, in spite of haphazard
          nourishment and nights spent on the stone floor of the reeking scullery, with
          the warm blood of health, great liquid black eyes, and the exquisitely delicate
          features of a young Praxitelean god. It was this preposterous perfection which,
          while redeeming him from ridiculous beauty by giving his childish face a certain
          rigidity, differentiated him outwardly from his fellows. Mr. Button, to whom the
          unusual was anathema, declared that the sight of the <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0023" n="12"/> monstrosity made him sick, and rarely
          suffered him in his presence; and one day Mrs. Button, discovering him in front
          of the cracked mirror in which Mr. Button shaved, when his hand was steady
          enough, on Sunday afternoons, smote him over the face with a pound of rump steak
          which she happened to be carrying, instinctively desirous not only to correct
          her son for vanity, but also to spoil the comeliness of which he might be vain. </p>
        <p>Until a wonderful and illuminating happening in his eleventh year, little Paul
          Kegworthy had taken existence with the fatalism of a child. Of his stepfather,
          who smelt lustily of sour beer, bad tobacco and incidentally of other things
          undetected by Paul's nostrils, and whom he saw rarely, he dwelt in mortal
          terror. When he heard of the Devil, at Sunday school, which he attended, to his
          stepfather's disgust, he pictured the Prince of Darkness not as a gentleman, not
          even as a picturesque personage with horns and tail, but as Mr. Button. As
          regards his mother, he had a confused idea that he was a living blight on her
          existence. He was not sorry, because it was not his fault, but in his childish
          way he coldly excused her, and, more from a queer consciousness of blighterdom
          than from dread of her hand and tongue, he avoided her as much as possible. In
          the little Buttons his experience as scapegoat taught him to take but little
          interest. From his earliest memories they were the first to be fed, clothed and
          bedded; to his own share fell the exiguous scraps. As they were much younger
          than himself, he found no pleasure in their companionship. For society he sought
          such of the youth of Budge Street as would admit him into their raucous
          fellowship. But, for some reason which his immature mind could not fathom, he
          felt a pariah even among his coverals. He could run as fast as Billy Goodge, the
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0024" n="13"/> undisputed leader of the gang; he
          could dribble the rag football past him any time he desired; once he had sent
          him home to his mother with a bleeding nose, and, even in that hour of triumph,
          popular sympathy had been with Billy, not with him. It was the only problem in
          existence to which his fatalism did not supply the key. He knew himself to be a
          better man than Billy Goodge. There was no doubt about it. At school, where
          Billy was the woodenest blockhead, he was top of his class. He knew things about
          troy weight and geography and Isaac and the Mariners of England of which Billy
          did not dream. To Billy the football news in the Saturday afternoon edition of
            <hi rend="italic">The Bludston Herald</hi> was a cryptogram; to him it was an
          open book. He would stand, acknowledged scholar, at the street corner and read
          out from the soiled copy retrieved by Chunky, the newsboy, the enthralling story
          of the football day, never stumbling over a syllable, athrill with the joy of
          being the umbilicus of a tense world, and, when the recital was over, he would
          have the mortification of seeing the throng pass away from him with the
          remorselessness of a cloud scudding from the moon. And he would hear Billy
          Goodge say exultantly: </p>
        <p>"Didn't Aw tell yo' the Wolves hadn't a dog's chance?" </p>
        <p>And he would see the admiring gang slap Billy on the back, and hear "Good owd
          Billy!" and never a word of thanks to him. Then, knowing Billy to be a liar, he
          would tell him so, yelping shrilly, in Buttonesque vernacular (North and South)
          : </p>
        <p>"This morning tha said it was five to one on Sheffield United." </p>
        <p>"Listen to Susie!" </p>
        <p>The parasitic urchins would yell at the witticism&mdash;the eternal <hi
            rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="it">petitio principii</foreign>
          </hi> of childhood, which Billy, <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0025" n="14"/>
          secure in his cohort from bloody nose, felt justified in making. And Paul
          Kegworthy, the rag of a newspaper crumpled tight in his little hand, would watch
          them disappear and wonder at the paradox of life. In any sphere of human effort,
          so he dimly and childishly realized, he could wipe out Billy Goodge. He had a
          soul-reaching contempt for Billy Goodge, a passionate envy of him. Why did Billy
          hold his position instead of crumbling into dust before him? Assuredly he was a
          better man than Billy. When, Billy <hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="la">duce et
              auspice</foreign> Billy</hi>, the gang played at pirates or Red Indians, it
          was pitiful to watch their ignorant endeavours. Paul, deeply read in the
          subject, gave them chapter and verse for his suggestions. But they heeded him so
          little that he would turn away contemptuously, disdaining the travesty of the
          noble game, and dream of a gang of brighter spirits whom he could lead to glory.
          Paul had many such dreams wherewith he sought to cheat the realities of
          existence: but until the Great Happening the dream was not better than the
          drink: after it came the Vision Splendid. </p>
        <p>The wonderful thing happened all because Maisie Shepherd, a slip of a girl of
          nineteen, staying at St. Luke's Vicarage, spilled a bottle of scent over her f
          rock. </p>
        <p>It was the morning of the St. Luke's annual Sunday-school treat. The waggonette
          was at the vicarage door. The vicar and his wife and daughter waited fussily for
          Maisie, an unpunctual damsel. The vicar looked at his watch. They were three
          minutes late, He tut-tutted impatiently. The vicar's daughter ran indoors in
          search of Maisie and pounced upon her as she sat on the edge of the bed in the
          act of perfuming a handkerchief. The shock caused the bottle to slip mouth
          downward from her hand and <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0026" n="15"/> empty the
          contents into her lap. She cried out in dismay. </p>
        <p>"Never mind," said the vicar's daughter. "Come along. Dad and mother are
          prancing about downstairs." </p>
        <p>"But I must change my dress!" </p>
        <p>"You've no time." </p>
        <p>"I'm wet through. This is the strongest scent known. It's twenty-six shillings
          a bottle, and one little drop is enough. I shall be a walking pestilence." </p>
        <p>The vicar's daughter laughed heartlessly. "You do smell strong. But you'll
          disinfect Bludston, and that will be a good thing." Whereupon she dragged the
          tearful and redolent damsel from the room. </p>
        <p>In the hard-featured yard of the schoolhouse the children were assembled-the
          girls on one side, the boys on the other. Curates and teachers hovered about the
          intervening space. Almost every child wore its Sunday best. Even the shabbiest
          little girls had a clean white pinafore to hide deficiencies beneath, and the
          untidiest little boy showed a scrubbed face. The majority of the boys wore clean
          collars; some grinned over gaudy neckties. The only one who appeared in his
          week-day grime and tatterdemalion outfit was little Paul Kegworthy. He had not
          changed his clothes, because he had no others; and he had not washed his face,
          because it had not occurred to him to do so. Moreover, Mrs. Button had made no
          attempt to improve his forlorn aspect, for the simple reason that she had never
          heard of the Sunday-school treat. It was part of Paul's philosophy to dispense,
          as far as he could, with parental control. On Sunday afternoons the little
          Buttons played in the streets, where Paul, had he so chosen, might have played
          also: but he put himself, so to speak, to Sunday school, where, besides learning
          lots of queer things about God and <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0027" n="16"/>
          Jesus Christ which interested him keenly, he could shine above his fellows by
          recitations of collects and bits of Catechism, which did not interest him at
          all. Then he won scores of good-conduct cards, gaudy treasures, with pictures of
          Daniel in the Lions' Den and the Marriage of Cana and such like, which he
          secreted preciously beneath a loose slab in the scullery floor. He did not show
          them to his mother, knowing that she would tear them up and bang him over the
          head; and for similar reasons he refrained from telling her of the Sunday-school
          treat. If she came to hear of it, as possibly she would through one of the
          little Buttons, who might pick up the news in the street, he would be soundly
          beaten. But there was a chance of her not hearing, and he desired to be no more
          of a blight than he could help. So Paul, vagabond and self-reliant from his
          babyhood, turned up at the Sunday-school treat, hatless and coatless, his dirty
          little toes visible through the holes in his boots, and his shapeless and
          tattered breeches secured to his person by a single brace. The better-dressed
          urchins moved away from him and made rude remarks, after the generous manner of
          their kind; but Paul did not care. Pariahdom was his accustomed portion. He was
          there for his own pleasure. They were going to ride in a train. They were going
          to have a wonderful afternoon in a nobleman's park, a place all grass and trees,
          elusive to the imagination. There was a stupefying prospect of wondrous things
          in profusion to eat and drink-jam, ginger-beer, cake! So rumour had it; and to
          unsophisticated Paul rumour was gospel truth. With all these unexperienced joys
          before him, what cared he for the blankety little blanks who gibed at him? If
          you imagine that little Paul Kegworthy formulated his thoughts as would the
          angel choir-boy in the pictures, you are mistaken. The baby language <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0028" n="17"/> of Bludston would petrify the foc'sle of
          a tramp, steamer. The North of England is justly proud of its virility. </p>
        <p>The Sunday school, marshalled by curates and teachers, awaited the party from
          the vicarage. The thick and darkened sunshine of Bludston flooded the asphalt of
          the yard, which sent up a reek of heat, causing curates to fan themselves with
          their black straw hats, and little boys in clean collars to wriggle in sticky
          discomfort, while in the still air above the ignoble town hung the heavy pall of
          smoke. Presently there was the sound of wheels and the sight of the head of the
          vicar's coachman above the coping of the schoolyard wall. Then the gates opened
          and the vicar and his wife and Miss Merewether, her daughter, and Maisie
          Shepherd appeared and were immediately greeted by curates and teachers. </p>
        <p>Maisie Shepherd, a stranger in a strange land, pretty, pink, blushing,
          hatefully self-conscious, detached herself, after a minute or two, from the
          group and looked with timid curiosity on the children. She was a London girl,
          her head still dancing with the delights of her first season, and she had never
          been to a Sunday-school treat in her life. Madge Merewether, her old
          schoolfellow, had told her she was to help amuse the little girls. Heaven knew
          how she was to do it. Already the unintelligibility of Lancashire speech had
          filled her with dismay. The array of hard-faced little girls daunted her; she
          turned to the boys, but she only saw one-the little hatless, coatless scarecrow
          with the perfect features And arresting grace, who stood out among his smug
          companions with the singularly vivid incongruity of a Greek Hermes in the
          central hall of Madame Tussaud's waxwork exhibition. Fascinated, she strayed
          down the line toward him. She halted, looked for a second or two into a <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0029" n="18"/> pair of liquid black eyes and then
          blushed in agonized shyness. She stared at the beautiful boy, and the beautiful
          boy stared at her, and not a word could she find in her head to speak. She
          turned abruptly and moved away. The boy broke rank and slowly followed her. </p>
        <p>For little Paul Kegworthy the heavens had opened and flooded his senses, till
          he nearly fainted, with the perfume of celestial lands. The intoxicating
          sweetness of it bewildered his young brain. It was nothing delicate, evanescent,
          like the smell of a flower. It as thick, pungent, cloying, compelling. Mouth
          agape and nostril wide, he followed the exquisite source of the emanation like
          one in a dream, half across the yard. A curate laughingly and unsuspectingly
          brought him back to earth by laying hands on him and bundling him back into his
          place. There he remained, being a docile urchin; but his eyes remained fixed on
          Maisie Shepherd. She was only a rosebud beauty of an English girl, her beauty
          heightened by the colour of distress, but to Paul the radiance of her person
          almost rivalled the wonder of her perfume. It was his first meeting of a goddess
          face to face, and he surrendered his whole being in adoration. </p>
        <p>In a few minutes the children were marched through the squalid streets, a
          strident band, to the dingy railway station, a grimy proletariat third-class
          railway station in which the sign "First Class Waiting Room" glared an outrage
          and a mockery, and were marshalled into the waiting train. The wonderful
          experience of which Paul had dreamed for weeks-he had never ridden in a train
          before-began; and soon the murky environs of the town were left behind and the
          train sped through the open country. </p>
        <p>His companions in the railway carriage crowded at the windows, fighting
          vigorously for right of place; <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0030" n="19"/> but
          Paul sat alone in the middle of the seat, unmoved by the new sensation and
          speed, and by the glimpses of blue sky and waving trees above the others' heads.
          The glory of the day was blotted out until he should see and smell the goddess
          again. At the wayside station where they descended he saw her in the distance'
          and the glory came once more. She caught his eye' smiled and nodded. He felt a
          queer thrill run through him. He had been singled out from among all the boys.
          He alone knew her. </p>
        <p>Brakes took them from the station down a country road and, after a mile or so,
          through stone gates of a stately park, where wonder after wonder was set out
          before Paul's unaccustomed eyes. On either side of this roadway stretched
          rolling grass with clumps and glades of great trees in their July
          bravery&mdash;more trees than Paul imagined could be in the world. There
          were sunlit upland patches and cool dells of shade carpeted with golden
          buttercups, where cattle fed lazily. Once a herd of fallow deer browsing by the
          wayside scuttled away at the noisy approach of the brakes. Only afterward did
          Paul learn their name and nature: to him then they were mythical beasts of
          fairyland. Once also the long pile -of the Tudor house came into view,
          flashing-white in the sunshine. The teacher in charge of the brake explained
          that it was the Marquis of Chudley's residence. It was more beautiful than
          anything Paul had ever seen; it was bigger than many churches put together; the
          word "Palace" came into his head&mdash;it transcended all his preconceived
          ideas of palaces: yet in such a palace only could dwell the radiant and
          sweet-smelling lady of his dream. The certainty gave him a curious satisfaction. </p>
        <p>They arrived at the spot where the marquees were erected, and at once began the
          traditional routine of the school treat-games for the girls, manlier sports <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0031" n="20"/> for the boys. Lord Chudley, patron of
          the living of St. Luke's, Bludston, and Lord Bountiful of the feast, had
          provided swing-boats and a merry-go-round which discoursed infernal music to
          enraptured ears. Paul stood aloof for a while from these delights, his eye on
          the section of the girls among whom his goddess moved. As soon as she became
          detached and he could approach her without attracting notice, he crept within
          the magic circle of the scent and lay down prone, drinking in its intoxication,
          and, as she moved, he wriggled toward her on his stomach like a young snake. </p>
        <p>After a time she came near him. "Why aren't you playing with the other boys?"
          she asked. </p>
        <p>Paul sat on his heels. "Dunno, miss," he said shyly. </p>
        <p>She glanced at his rapscallion attire, blushed, and blamed herself for the
          tactless question. "This is a beautiful place, isn't it?" </p>
        <p>"It's heavenly," said Paul, with his eyes on her. </p>
        <p>"One scarcely wants to do anything but just-just -well, be here." She smiled. </p>
        <p>He nodded and said, "Ay!" Then he grew bolder. "I like being alone," he
          declared defiantly. </p>
        <p>"Then I'll leave you," she laughed. </p>
        <p>The blood flushed deep under his unwashed olive skin, and he leaped to his
          feet. "Aw didn't mean that!" he protested hotly. "It wur them other boys." </p>
        <p>She was touched by his beauty and quick sensitiveness. "I was only teasing. I'm
          sure you like being with me." </p>
        <p>Paul had never heard such exquisite tones from human lips. To his ears,
          accustomed to the harsh Lancashire burr, her low, accentless voice was music. So
          another of his senses was caught in the enchantment. </p>
        <p>"Yo' speak so pretty," said he. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0032" n="21"/>
        </p>
        <p>At that moment a spruce but perspiring young teacher came up. "We're going to
          have some boys' races, miss, and we want the ladies to look on. His lordship has
          offered prizes. The first is a boys' race-under eleven." </p>
        <p>"You can join in that, anyhow," she said to Paul. "Go along and let me see you
          win." </p>
        <p>Paul scudded off, his heart aflame, his hand, as he ran, tucking in the shirt
          whose evasion from the breeches was beyond the control of the single brace.
          Besides, crawling on your stomach is dislocating even to the most neatly secured
          attire. But his action was mechanical. His thoughts were with his goddess. In
          his inarticulate mind he knew himself to be her cham-pion. He sped under her
          consecration. He knew he could run. He could run like a young deer. Though
          despised, could he not outrun any of the youth in Budge Street? He took his
          place in the line of competing children. Far away in the grassy distance were
          two men holding a stretched string. On one side of him was a tubby boy with a
          freckled face and an amorphous nose on which the perspiration beaded; on the
          other a lank, consumptive creature, in Eton collar and red tie and a sprig of
          sweet William in his buttonhole, a very superior person. Neither of them desired
          his propinquity. They tried to hustle him from the line. But Paul, born Ishmael,
          had his hand against them. The fat boy, smitten beneath the belt, doubled up in
          pain and the consumptive person rubbed agonized shins. A curate, walking down
          repressing bulges and levelling up concavities, ordained order. The line stood
          tense. Away beyond, toward the goal, appeared a white mass, which Paul knew to
          be the ladies in their summer dresses; and among them, though he could not
          distinguish her, was she in whose eyes he was to win <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0033" n="22"/> glory. The prize did not matter. It was
          for her that he was running. In his childish mind he felt passionately
          identified with her. He was her champion. </p>
        <p>The word was given. The urchins started. Paul, his little elbows squared behind
          him and his eyes fixed vacantly in space, ran with his soul in the toes that
          protruded through the ragged old boots. He knew not who was in front or who was
          behind. It was the madness of battle. He ran and ran, until somebody put his
          arms round him and stopped him. </p>
        <p>"Steady on, my boy-steady on!" </p>
        <p>Paul looked round in a dazed way. "Have A' won th' race?" </p>
        <p>"I'm afraid not, my lad." </p>
        <p>With a great effort he screwed his mind to another question. "Wheer did A' coom
          in?" </p>
        <p>"About sixth, but you ran awfully well." </p>
        <p>Sixth! He had come in sixth! Sky and grass and trees and white mass of ladies
          (among whom was the goddess) and unconsiderable men and boys became a shimmering
          blur. He seemed to stagger away, stagger miles away, until, finding himself
          quite alone, he threw himself down under a beech tree, and, after a few moments'
          vivid realization of what had happened, sobbed out the agony of his little
          soul's despair. Sixth! He had come in sixth! He had failed miserably in his
          championship. How she must despise him-she who had sent him forth to victory!
          And yet how 'had it been possible? How had it been possible that other boys
          could beat him? He was he. An indomitable personage. Some hideous injustice
          guided human affairs. Why shouldn't he have won? He could not tell. But he had
          not won. She had sent him forth to win. He had lost. He had come in a sickening
          sixth. The disgrace devastated him. </p>
        <p>Maisie Shepherd, interested in her child champion, <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0034" n="23"/> sought him out and easily found him
          under the beech tree. "Why, what is the matter?" </p>
        <p>As he did not answer, she knelt by his side and put her hand on his lean
          shoulder. "Tell me what has happened." </p>
        <p>Again the celestial fragrance overspread his senses. He checked his sobs and
          wiped his eyes with the back of his grubby hand. "Aw didn't win," he moaned. </p>
        <p>"Poor little chap," she said comfortingly. "Did you want to win so very much?" </p>
        <p>He got up and stared at her. "Yo' told me to win." </p>
        <p>"So you ran for me?" </p>
        <p>"Ay !" </p>
        <p>She rose to her feet and looked down upon him, somewhat overwhelmed by her
          responsibility. So in ancient days might a fair maiden have regarded her knight
          who underwent entirely unnecessary batterings for her sake. "Then for me you've
          won," she said. "I wish I could give you a prize." </p>
        <p>But what in the nature of a prize for a gutter imp of eleven does a pocketless
          young woman attired for the serious business of a school treat carry upon her
          person? She laughed in pretty embarrassment. "If I gave you something quite
          useless, what would you do with it?" </p>
        <p>"I 'u'd hide it safe, so 'ut nobody should see it," said Paul, thinking of his
          precious cards. </p>
        <p>"Wouldn't you show it to anybody?" </p>
        <p>"By Gum!&mdash;" he checked himself suddenly. Such, he had learned, was not
          Sunday-school language. "I wouldno' show it to a dog," said he. </p>
        <p>Maisie Shepherd, aware of romantic foolishness, slipped a cornelian heart from
          a thin gold chain round her neck. "It's all I can give you for a prize, if you
          will have it." </p>
        <p>If he would have it? The Koh-i-Noor' in his clutch <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0035" n="24"/> (and a knowledge of its value) could not
          have given him more thrilling rapture. He was speechless with amazement; Maisie,
          thrilled too, realized that a word spoken would have rung false. The boy gloated
          over his treasure; but she did not know&mdash;how could she?&mdash;what
          it meant to him. To Paul the bauble was a bit of the warm wonder that was she. </p>
        <p>"How are you going to keep it?" she asked. </p>
        <p>He hoicked a bit of his shirt-tail from his breeches and proceeded to knot the
          cornelian heart secure therein. Maisie fled rapidly on the verge of hysterics,
          After that the school treat had but one meaning for Paul. He fed, it is true, in
          Pantagruelian fashion on luscious viands, transcending his imagination of those
          which lay behind Blinks the confectioner's window in Bludston: there he
          succumbed to the animal; but the sports, the swing-boats, the merry-go-round,
          offered no temptation. He hovered around Maisie Shepherd like a little dog-quite
          content to keep her in sight. And every two or three minutes he fumbled about
          his breeches to see that the knotted treasure was safe. </p>
        <p>The day sank into late afternoon. The children had been fed. The weary elders
          had their tea. The vicarage party took a few moments' rest in the shade of a
          clump of firs some distance away from the marquee. Behind the screen lay Paul,
          his eyes on his goddess, his heels in the air, a buttercup-stalk between his
          teeth. He felt the comforting knot beneath his thigh. For the first time,
          perhaps, in his life, he knew utter happiness. He heard the talk, but did not
          listen. Suddenly, however, the sound of his own name caused him to prick his
          ears. Paul Kegworthy! They were talking about him. There could be no mistake. He
          slithered a foot or two nearer. </p>
        <p>"No matter whether his people are drunkards or murderers," said the beloved
          voice, "he is the most <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0036" n="25"/> beautiful thing
          I've ever seen in ' my life. Have you ever spoken to him, Winifred?" </p>
        <p>"No," said the vicar's daughter. "Of course I've noticed him. Every one does-he
          is remarkable." </p>
        <p>"I don't believe he's a child of these people at all," Maisie declared. "He's
          of a different clay. He's as sensitive as-as a sensitive plant. You ought to
          keep your eye on him, Mr. Merewether. I believe he's a poor little prince in a
          fairy tale." </p>
        <p>"A freak-a <hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="la">lusus
              natur&oelig;</foreign>"</hi> said the vicar. </p>
        <p>Paul did not know what a <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="la"> lusus natur&oelig;</foreign>
          </hi> was, but it sounded mighty grand. </p>
        <p>"He's a fairy prince, and one day he'll come into his kingdom." </p>
        <p>"My dear, if you saw his mother!" </p>
        <p>"But I'm sure no one but a princess could be Paul Kegworthy's mother," laughed
          Maisie. </p>
        <p>"And his father?" </p>
        <p>"A prince too!" </p>
        <p>And Paul listened and drank in his goddess's words greedily. Truth clear as
          crystal fell from her lips. A wild wonder racked his little soul. She had said
          that his mother was not his mother, and that his father was a prince. The
          tidings capped the glory of an effulgent day. </p>
        <p>When he sneaked home late Mrs. Button, who had learned how he had misspent his
          time, gave him a merciless thrashing. Why should he be trapesing about with
          Sunday schools, she asked, with impolite embroidery, while his poor little
          brothers and sisters were crying in the street? She would learn him to Mess
          about with parsons and Sunday-school teachers. She was in process of "learning"
          him when Mr. Button entered. He swore in a manner which would have turned out
          armies in Flanders pallid, and kicked Paul into the scullery. There the boy
          remained and <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0037" n="26"/> went supperless to his
          bed of sacks, aching and tearless. Before he slept he put his cornelian heart in
          his hiding-hole. What cared he for stripes or kicks or curses with the Vision
          Splendid glowing before his eyes ?</p>

        <head>CHAPTER II</head>

        <p>FOR splenetic reasons which none but the Buttons of this world can appreciate,
          Paul was forbidden, under pain of ghastly tortures, to go near the Sunday school
          again, and, lest he should defy authority, he was told off on Sunday afternoons
          to mind the baby, either in the street or the scullery, according to the
          weather, while the other little Buttons were not allowed to approach him. The
          defection of the brilliant scholar having been brought to the vicar's notice, he
          ventured to call one Saturday afternoon on the Buttons, but such was the
          contumely with which he was received that the good man hastily retreated. In
          lung power he was outmatched. In repartee he was singularly outclassed. He then
          sent the superintendent of the school, a man of brawn and zeal, to see what
          muscular Christianity could accomplish. But muscular Christianity, losing its
          head, came off with a black eye. After that the Buttons were left alone, and no
          friendly hand drew Paul within the gates of his Sunday Paradise. He thought of
          it with aching wistfulness. The only thing that the superintendent could do was
          to give him surreptitiously a prayer-book, bidding him perfect himself in the
          Catechism in view of future Confirmation. But, as emulation of his fellows and
          not religious zeal was the mainspring of Paul's enthusiasm, the pious behest was
          disregarded. Paul dived into the volume occasionally, however, for intellectual
          entertainment. </p>
        <p>As for the fragrant and beautiful goddess, she had <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0039" n="28"/> disappeared into thin air. Paul hung for
          a week or two about the vicarage, in the hope of seeing her, but in vain. As a
          matter of fact, Maisie Shepherd had left for Scotland the morning after the
          school treat; people don't come to Bludston for long and happy holidays. So Paul
          had to feed his ardent little soul on memories. That she had not been an
          impalpable creature of his fancy was proven by the precious cornelian heart. Her
          words, too, were written in fine flame across his childish mind. Paul began to
          live the life of dreams. </p>
        <p>He longed for books. The fragmentary glimpses of history and geography in the
          Board school standard whetted without satisfying his imagination. There was not
          a book in the house in Budge Street, and he had never a penny to buy one.
          Sometimes Button would bring home a dirty newspaper, which Paul would steal and
          read in secret, but its contents seemed to lack continuity. He thirsted for a
          story. Once a generous boy, since dead-he was too good to live had given him a
          handful of penny dreadfuls, whence he had derived his knowledge of pirates and
          Red Indians. Too careless and confident, he had left them about the kitchen, and
          his indignant mother had used them to light the fire. The burning of his library
          was an enduring tragedy. He realized that it must be reconstituted; but how? His
          nimble wit hit on a plan. Vagrant as an unowned dog, he could roam the streets
          at pleasure. Why should he not sell newspapers-in a quarter of the town, be it
          understood, remote from both factory and Budge Street? He sold newspapers for
          three weeks before he was found out. Then he was chastised and forced to go on
          selling newspapers with no profit to himself, for his person was rigorously
          searched and coppers confiscated as soon as he came home. But during the three
          weeks' <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0040" n="29"/> traffic on his own account he
          had amassed a sufficient hoard of pennies for the purchase of several books in
          gaudy paper covers exposed for sale in the little stationer's shop round the
          corner. Soon he discovered that if he could batik a copper or two on his way
          home his mother would be none the wiser. The stationer became his banker, and
          when the amount of the deposit equaled the price of a book, Paul withdrew his
          money's worth. So a goodly library of amazing rubbish was stored by degrees
          under the scullery slab, until it outgrew safe accommodation; whereupon Paul
          transferred the bulk of it to a hole in a bit of waste ground, a deserted
          brickfield on the ragged outskirts of the town. At last misfortune befell him.
          One dreary afternoon of rain he dropped his new bundle of papers in the mud of
          the roadway. To avoid death he had to spring from the path of a thundering
          tramcar. A heavy cart ran over the bundle. While he was ruefully and hastily
          gathering the papers together, a band of street children swooped down and kicked
          them lustily about the filth. He was battling with one urchin when a policeman
          grabbed him. With an elusive twist he escaped and ran like a terrified hare.
          Disaster followed, and that was the end of his career as a newsvendor. </p>
        <p>Greater leisure for reading, however, compensated the loss of the occasional
          penny. He read dazzling tales of dukes with palaces (like Chudley Court), and
          countesses with ropes of diamonds in their hair, who all bore a resemblance to
          the fragrant one. And dukes and countesses lived the most resplendent lives, and
          spoke such beautiful language, and had such a way with them! He felt a curious
          pride in being able to enter into all their haughty emotions. Then, one day, he
          began a story about a poor little outcast boy in a slum. At first he did not
          care for it. His soaring <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0041" n="30"/> spirit
          disdained boys in slums. It had its being on higher planes. But he read on, and,
          reading on, grew interested, until interest was intensified into absorption For
          the outcast boy in the slums, you must know, was really the kidnapped child of a
          prince and a princess, and after the most romantic adventures was enfolded in
          his parents' arms, married a duke's beauteous daughter, whom in his poverty he
          had worshipped from afar, and drove away with his bride in a coach-and-six. </p>
        <p>To little Paul Kegworthy the clotted nonsense was a revelation from on high. He
          was that outcast boy. The memorable pronouncement of the goddess received
          confirmation in some kind of holy writ. The Vision Splendid, hitherto confused,
          crystallized into focus. He realized vividly how he differed in feature and form
          and intellect and character from the low crowd with whom he was associated. His
          unpopularity was derived from envy. His manifest superiority was gall to their
          base natures. Yes, he had got to the heart of the mystery. Mrs. Button was not
          his mother. For reasons unknown he had been kidnapped. Aware of his high
          lineage, she hated him and beat him and despitefully used him. She never gushed,
          it is true, over her offspring; but the little Buttons flourished under genuine
          motherment. They, inconsiderable brats, were her veritable children. Whereas he,
          Paul-it was as plain as daylight. Somewhere far away in the great world, an
          august and griefstricken pair, at that very moment, were mourning the loss of
          their only son. There they were, in their marble palace, surrounded by flunkeys
          all crimson and gold (men servants were always "gorgeously apparelled flunkeys"
          in Paul's books), sitting at a table loaded with pineapples on golden dishes,
          and eating out their hearts with longing. He could hear their talk. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0042" n="31"/>
        </p>
        <p>"If only our beloved son were with us," said the princess, wiping away a tear. </p>
        <p>"We must be patient, my sweet Highness," replied the prince, with lofty
          resignation stamped on his noble brow. "Let us trust to Heaven to remove the
          cankerworm that is gnawing our vitals." </p>
        <p>Paul felt very sorry for them, and he, too, wiped away a tear. </p>
        <p>For many years he remembered that day. He was alone in his brickfield on a
          gusty March morning-the Easter holidays had released him from school-squatting
          by his hole under the lee of a mass of earth and rubbish. It was a mean expanse,
          blackened by soot and defiled by refuse. Here and there bramble and stunted
          gorse struggled for an existence; but the flora mainly consisted in bits of old
          boots and foul raiment protruding grotesquely from the soil, half-buried cans,
          rusty bits of iron, and broken bottles. On one side the backs of grimy little
          houses, their yards full of fluttering drab underwear' marked the edge of the
          hopeless town which rose above them in forbidding buildings, belching chimney
          shafts and the spikes of a couple of spires. On the other sides it was bounded
          by the brick walls of factories, the municipal gasworks and the approach to the
          railway station, indicated by signal-posts standing out against the sky like
          gallows, and a tram-line bordered by a row of skeleton cottages. Golgotha was a
          grim garden compared with Paul's brickfield. Sometimes the children of the town
          scuttled about it like dingy little rabbits. But more often it was a desolate
          solitude. Perhaps all but the lowest of the parents of Bludston had put the
          place out of bounds, as gipsies and other dwellers in vans were allowed to camp
          there. It also bore an evil name because a night murder or two had been
          committed in its murky seclusion. Paul knew the exact spot, an <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0043" n="32"/> ugly cavity toward the gasworks end,
          where a woman had been "done in," and even he, lord of the brickfield, preferred
          to remain at a purifying distance. But it was his own domain. He felt in it a
          certain pride of possession. The hollow under the lee of the rubbish-heap, by
          the side of the hole where he kept his paper library, was the most homelike
          place he knew. </p>
        <p>For many years he remembered that day. The light that never was on sea or land
          fell upon the brickfield. He had read the story at one stretch. He had sat there
          for hours reading, for hours rapt in his Vision. At last material darkness began
          to gather round him, and he awoke with a start to realization that he had been
          sitting there most of the day. With a sigh he replaced his book in the hole,
          which he cunningly masked with a lump of hard clay, and, feeling stiff and cold,
          ran, childlike, homeward. In the silence of the night he took out his cornelian
          heart and fondled it. The day had been curiously like, yet utterly unlike, the
          day on which she had taken it from her neck. In a dim fashion he knew that the
          two days were of infinite significance in his life and were complementary. He
          had been waiting, as it were, for nine months for this day's revelation, this
          day's confirmation. </p>
        <p>Paul rose the next morning, a human being with a fixed idea, an unquestioned
          faith in his destiny. His star shone clear. He was born to great things. In
          those early years that followed it was not a matter of an imaginative child's
          vanity, but the unalterable, serene conviction of a child's soul. The prince and
          princess were realities, his future greatness a magnificent certitude. You must
          remember this, if you would understand Paul's after-life. It was built on this
          radiant knowledge. In the afternoon he met Billy Goodge and the gang. They were
          playing at soldiers, <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0044" n="33"/> Billy
          distinguished by a cocked hat made out of newspaper and a wooden sword. </p>
        <p>"Coom on, Susie, wi be going to knock hell out of the boys in Stamford Street." </p>
        <p>Paul folded his arms and looked at him contemptuously, as became one of his
          noble blood. "You could no' knock hell out of a bug." </p>
        <p>"What's that tha says?" </p>
        <p>Paul repeated the insult. </p>
        <p>"Say that agen!" blustered the cocked-hatted leader. </p>
        <p>Paul said it again and nothing happened, Billy received vociferous and
          sanguinary advice couched in sanguinary terms. </p>
        <p>"Try and hit me!" said Billy. </p>
        <p>The scene was oddly parallel with one in the story of the outcast boy of the
          gutter. Paul, conscious of experiment, calmly went up to him and kicked him. He
          kicked him hard. The sensation was delicious. Billy edged away. He knew from
          past experience that if it came to blows he was no match for Paul, but hitherto,
          having shown fight, he had received the support of the gang. Now, however, there
          was an extraordinary quality in Paul's defiance which took the spirit out of
          him. Once more he was urged by the ragged brats to deeds of blood. He did not
          respond. Paul kicked him again before his followers. If he could have gone on
          kicking him for ever and ever what delirium of joy were eternity! Billy edged
          farther away. The mongrel game-cock was beaten. Paul, dramatically conscious of
          what the unrecognized prince would do in such a circumstance, advanced, smacked
          his face, plucked the cocked hat from his head, the sword from his hand, and
          invested himself with these insignia of leadership, Billy melted silently into
          the subfusc air of Budge Street. The ragged regiment looked around and there was
          no Billy. Paul Keg <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0045" n="34"/> worthy, the
          raggedest of them all, with nothing to recommend him but his ridiculous exotic
          beauty and the paper and wooden <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="it">spolia opima</foreign>
          </hi> of the vanquished, stood before them, a tattered Caesar. The gang hung
          spellbound. They were ready, small band of heroes, to follow him against the
          hordes of Stamford Street. They only awaited his signal. Paul tasted a joy known
          but to few of the sons of men-absolute power over, and supreme contempt for, his
          fellows. He stood for a moment or two, in the grey, miserable street discordant
          with the wailings of babies and the clamour of futile little girls, who, after
          the manner of women, had no idea of political crisis, and the shrill
          objurgations of slattern mothers and the raucous cries of an idealist vendor of
          hyacinths, and, cocked hat on head and wooden sword in hand, he looked at his
          fawning army. Then came the touch of genius that was often to characterize his
          actions in after years. It was mimetic, as he had read of such a thing in his
          paper-covered textbooks-but it was none the less a touch of genius. He frowned
          on the dirty, ignoble little boys. What had he in common with them-he, the son
          of a prince? Nothing. He snapped his sword across his knee, tore his cocked hat
          in two, and, casting the fragments before them, marched proudly toward the very
          last place on the face of the earth that he desired to visit-his own home. The
          army remained for a few seconds bewildered by the dramatic and unexpected, and,
          leaderless, did what many a real army has done in similar circumstances,
          straggled into disintegration. </p>
        <p>Thenceforward, Paul, had he so chosen, could have ruled despotically in Budge
          Street. But he did not choose. The games from which he used to be excluded, or
          in which he used to be allowed to join on sufferance, no longer appealed to him.
          He preferred <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0046" n="35"/> to let Joey Meakin lead
          the gang, <hi rend="italic">vice</hi> Billy Goodge deposed, while he himself
          remained aloof. Now and then he condescended to arbitrate between disputants or
          to kick a little brute of a, bully, but he felt that, in doing so, he was
          derogating from his high dignity. It was his joy to feel himself a dark,
          majestic power overshadowing the street, a kind of Grand Llama hidden in
          mystery. Often he would walk through the midst of the children, seemingly
          unconscious of their existence, acting strenuously to himself his part of a
          high-born prince. </p>
        <p>This lasted till a dark and awful day when Mr. Button pitched him into the
          factory. These were times before kindly Education Acts and Factory Acts decreed
          that no boy under twelve years of age should work in a factory, and that every
          boy under fourteen should spend half his time at the factory and half at school.
          Paul's education was considered complete, and he had to plunge into full time at
          the grim and grinding place. He had joined the great army of workers. A wide
          gulf separated him from the gang of Budge Street. It existed for him no more
          than did the little girls and babies. Life changed its aspect entirely. Gone
          were the days of vagabondage, the lazy, the delicious even though cold and
          hungry hours of dreaming and reading in the brickfield; gone was the happy
          freedom of the chartered libertine of the gutter. He was bound, a little slave,
          like hundreds of other little slaves and thousands of big ones, to a relentless
          machine. He entered the hopeless factory gate at six in the morning and left it
          at half-past five in the evening; and, his rough food swallowed, slunk to his
          kennel in the scullery like a little tired dog. And Mr. Button drank, and beat
          Mrs. Button, and Mrs. Button beat Paul whenever she felt in the humour and had
          anything handy to do it with, and, as a matter of <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0047" n="36"/> course, confiscated his wages on
          Saturday and set him to mind the baby on Sunday afternoons. In the monotony,
          weariness and greyness of life the glory of the Vision began to grow dim. </p>
        <p>In the factory he was not thrown into competition with other boys. He was the
          skip, the drudge, the carrier and fetcher, the cleaner and polisher for a
          work-bench of men devoid of sentiment and blind to his princely qualities. He
          tried, indeed, by nimbleness of hand and intelligence, to impress them with his
          superiority to his predecessors, but they were not impressed. At the most he
          escaped curses. His mind began to work in the logic of the real. Entrance into
          his kingdom implied as a primary condition release from the factory. But how
          could such release come, when every morning a remorseless and insensate hook
          -just like a certain hook in the machinery whose deadly certainty of grip
          fascinated and terrified him, caught him from his morning sleep every morning of
          .his life, save Sunday, and swung him inexorably into the factory? He looked
          around and saw that no one was released, except through death or illness or
          incompetence. And the incompetent starved. Any child in Budge Street with a
          grain of sense knew that. There was no release. He, son of a prince, would work
          for ever and ever in Bludston. His heart failed him. And there was no one to
          whom he could tell the tragic and romantic story of his birth. One or two happy
          gleams of brightness, however, lightened his darkness and prevented the Vision
          from fading entirely into the greyness of the factory sky. Once the Owner, an
          unspeakable god with a bald pink head and a paunch vastly chained with gold,
          conducted a party of ladies over the works. One of the latter, a very grand
          lady, noticed him at his bench and came -and spoke kindly to him. Her voice had
          the same <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0048" n="37"/> sweet timbre as his
          goddess's. After she had left him his quick ears caught her question to the
          Owner: "Where did you get your young Apollo? Not out of Lancashire, surely? He's
          wonderful." And just before she passed out of sight she turned and looked at him
          and smiled. He learned on inquiry that she was the Marchioness of Chudley. The
          instant recognition of him by one of his own aristocratic caste revived his
          faith. The day would assuredly come. Suppose it had been his own mother, instead
          of the Marchioness? Stranger things happened in the books. The other gleam
          proceeded from one of the workmen at his bench, a serious and socialistic person
          who occasionally lent him something to read: Foxe's "Book of Martyrs," "Mill on
          Liberty," Bellamy's "Looking Backward," at that time at the height of its
          popularity. And sometimes he would talk to Paul about collectivism and the new
          era that was coming when there would be no such words as rich and poor, because
          there would be no such classes as they denoted. </p>
        <p>Paul would say: "Then a prince will be no better than a factory hand?" </p>
        <p>"There won't be any princes, I tell thee," his friend would reply, and launch
          out into a denunciation of tyrants. </p>
        <p>But this did not suit Paul. If there were to be no princes, where, would he
          come in? So, while grateful to the evangelist for talking to him and treating
          him as a human being, he totally rejected his gospel. It struck at the very
          foundations of his visionary destiny. He was afraid to argue, for his friend was
          vehement. Also confession of aristocratic prejudices might turn friendship into
          enmity. But his passionate antagonism to the communistic theory, all the more
          intense through suppression, strengthened his fantastic faith. Still, the
          transient smile of a marchioness <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0049" n="38"/> and
          the political economy of a sour-avised operative are not enough to keep alive
          the romance of underfed, ill-clad, overdriven childhood. And after a while he
          was deprived even of the latter consolation, his friend being shifted to another
          end of the factory. In despair he turned to Ada, the eldest of the little
          Buttons, who now had reached years of comparative discretion, and strove to
          interest her in his dreams, veiling his identity under a fictitious name; but
          Ada, an unimaginative and practical child with a growing family to look after,
          either listened stupidly or consigned him, in the local vernacular, to
          perdition. </p>
        <p>"But suppose 'it was me that was the unknown prince? Supposing it was me I've
          been talking about all the time? Supposing it was me that went away and came
          back in a gold coach and six horses, with a duke's daughter all over diamonds by
          my side, what would tha say?" </p>
        <p>"I think tha art nowt but a fool," said the elderly child of ten, "and, if
          mother heard thee, she'd lamm. the life out of thee." </p>
        <p>Paul had the sickening sensation of the man who has confided the high secrets
          of his soul to coarsefibred woman. He turned away, darkly conscious of having
          magnanimously given Ada a chance to mount with him into the upper air, which
          opportunity she, daughter of earth, had, in her purblind manner, refused.
          Thenceforward Ada was to him an unnoticeable item in the cosmos. </p>
        <p>One hopeless month succeeded another, until a cloud seemed to close round
          Paul's brain, rendering him automatic in his actions, merely animal in his
          half-satisfied appetites. Fines and curses were his portion at the factory;
          curses and beatings&mdash;deserved if Justice held a hurried scale at home.
          Paul, who had read of suicide in <hi rend="italic">The Bludston Herald</hi>,
          turned his thoughts <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0050" n="39"/> morbidly to death.
          But his dramatic imagination always carried him beyond' his own demise to the
          scene in the household when his waxlike corpse should be discovered dangling
          from a rope fixed to the hook in the kitchen ceiling. He posed cadaverous before
          a shocked Budge Street, before a conscience-stricken factory; and he wept on his
          sack bed in the scullery because the prince and the princess, his august
          parents, would never know that he had died. A whit less gloomy were his
          imaginings of the said prince and princess rushing into the house, in the nick
          of time, just before life was extinct, and cutting him down. How they were to
          find him he did not know. This side-track exploration of possibilities was a
          symptom of sanity. </p>
        <p>Yet, Heaven knows what would have happened to Paul, after a year or so at the
          factory, if Barney Bill, a grotesque god from the wide and breezy spaces of the
          world, had not limped into his life. </p>
        <p>Barney Bill wore the cloth cap and conventional and unpicturesque, though
          shapeless and weather-stained, garment of the late nineteenth century. Neither
          horns nor goat's feet were visible; nor was the pipe of reed on which he played.
          Yet he played, in Paul's ear, the comforting melody of Pan, and the glory of the
          Vision once more flooded Paul's senses, and the factory and Budge Street and the
          Buttons and the scullery faded away like an evil dream. </p>

        <head>CHAPTER III</head>

        <p>THE Fates arranged Barney Bill's entrance late on a Saturday afternoon in
          August. It was not dramatic. It was merely casual. They laid the scene in the
          brickfield. </p>
        <p>It had rained all day, and now there was sullen clearance. Paul, who had been
          bathing with some factory boys in the not very savoury canal a mile or so
          distant, had wandered mechanically to his brickfield library, which, by means of
          some scavenging process, he managed to keep meagrely replenished. Here he had
          settled himself with a dilapidated book on his knees for an hour's intellectual
          enjoyment. It was not a cheerful evening. The ground was sodden, and rank
          emanations rose from the refuse. From where he sat he could see an angry sunset
          like a black-winged dragon with belly of flame brooding over the town. The place
          wore an especial air of desolation. Paul felt depressed. Bathing in the pouring
          wet is a chilly sport, and his midday meal of cold potatoes had not been
          invigorating. These he had grabbed, and, having done them up hastily in
          newspaper, had bolted with them out of the house. He had been fined heavily for
          slackness during the week, and Mr. Button's inevitable wrath at docked wages he
          desired to undergo as late as possible. Then, the sun had blazed furiously
          during the last six imprisoned days, and now the long-looked for hours of
          freedom were disfigured by rain and blight. He resented the malice of things. He
          also <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0052" n="41"/> resented the invasion of his
          brickfield by an alien van, a gaudy vehicle, yellow and red, to the exterior of
          which clinging wicker chairs, brooms, brushes and jute mats gave the impression
          of a lunatic's idea of decoration. An old horse, hobbled a few feet away,
          philosophically cropped the abominable grass. On the front of the van a man
          squatted with food and drink. Paul hated him as a trespasser and a gormandizer. </p>
        <p>Presently the man, shading his eyes with his hand, scrutinized the small,
          melancholy figure, and then, hopping from his perch, sped toward him with a
          nimble and curiously tortuous gait. </p>
        <p>He approached, a wiry, almost wizened, little man of fifty, tanned to gipsy
          brown. He had a shrewd thin face, with an oddly flattened nose, and little round
          moist dark eyes that glittered like diamonds. He wore cloth cap on the back of
          his head, showing in front a thick mass of closely cropped hair. His collarless
          shirt was open at the neck and his sleeves were rolled up above the elbow. </p>
        <p>"You're Polly Kegworthy's kid, ain't you?" he asked. </p>
        <p>"Ay," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Seen you afore, haven't I ?' Then Paul remembered. Three or four times during
          his life, at long, long intervals, the van had passed down Budge Street,
          stopping at houses here and there. About two years ago, coming home, he had met
          it at his own door. His mother and the little man were talking together. The man
          had taken him under the chin and twisted his face up. "Is that the nipper?" he
          had asked. </p>
        <p>His mother had nodded, and, releasing Paul with a clumsy gesture of simulated
          affection, had sent him with twopence for a pint of beer to the public-house at
          the end of the street. He recalled how the man had <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0053" n="42"/> winked his little bright eye at his
          mother before putting the jug to his lips. </p>
        <p>"I browt th' beer for yo'," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"You did. It was the worst beer, bar none, I've ever had. I can taste it now."
          He made a wry face. Then he cocked his head on one side. "I suppose you're
          wondering who I am?" said he. </p>
        <p>"Ay," said Paul. "Who art tha?" </p>
        <p>"I'm Barney Bill," replied the man. "Did you never hear of me? I'm known on the
          road from Taunton to Newcastle and from Hereford to Lowestoft. You can tell yer
          mother that you seed me." </p>
        <p>A smile curled round Paul's lips at the comic idea of giving his mother
          unsolicited information. "Barney Bill?" said he. </p>
        <p>"Yuss," said the man. Then, after a pause, "What are you doing of there?" </p>
        <p>"Reading," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Let's have a look at it." </p>
        <p>Paul regarded him suspiciously; but there was kindliness in the twinkling
          glance. He handed him the sorry apology for a book. </p>
        <p>Barney Bill turned it over. 'Why, said he, "it ain't got no beginning and no
          end. It's all middle. 'Kenilworth.' Do yer like it?" </p>
        <p>"Ay!" said Paul. "It's foine." </p>
        <p>"Who do yer think wrote it?" </p>
        <p>As both cover and a hundred pages at the beginning, including the title-page,
          to say nothing of a hundred pages at the end, were missing, Paul had no clue to
          the authorship. </p>
        <p>"Dunno," said he. </p>
        <p>"Sir Walter Scott." </p>
        <p>Paul jumped to his feet. Sir Walter Scott, he knew not why or how, was one of
          those bright names that starred in his historical darkness, like Caesar and <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0054" n="43"/> Napoleon and Ridley and Latimer and W.
          G. Grace. </p>
        <p>"Tha' art sure? Sir Water Scott?" </p>
        <p>The shock of meeting Sir Walter in the flesh could not have been greater. The
          man nodded. "Think I'd tell yer a lie? I do a bit of reading myself in the old
          'bus there"-he jerked a thumb&mdash;"I've got some books now. Would yer like
          to see 'em?" </p>
        <p>Would a mouse like cheese? Paul started off with his new companion. </p>
        <p>"If it wasn't for a book or two, I'd go melancholy mad and bust myself," the
          latter remarked. </p>
        <p>Paul's spirit leaped toward a spiritual brother. It was precisely his own case. </p>
        <p>"You'll find a lot of chaps that don't hold with books. Dessay you've met 'em?" </p>
        <p>Paul laughed, precipient of irony. </p>
        <p>Barney Bill continued: "I've heard some on 'em say: 'What's the good of books?
          Give me nature,' and they goes and asks for it at the public-'ouse. Most say
          nothing at all, but just booze." </p>
        <p>"Like father," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Eh?" cried his friend sharply. </p>
        <p>"Sam Button, what married mother." </p>
        <p>"Ali! so he boozes a lot, does he?" </p>
        <p>Paul drew an impressionistic and lurid picture of Mr. Button. </p>
        <p>"And they fight?" </p>
        <p>"Like billy-o," said Paul. </p>
        <p>They reached the van. Barney Bill, surprisingly agile in spite of his twisted
          leg, sprang into the interior. Paul, standing between the shafts, looked in with
          curiosity. There was a rough though not unclean bed running down one side.
          Beyond, at the stern, so to speak, was a kind of galley containing cooking
          stove, kettle and pot. There were shelves, some filled with stock-in-trade,
          others with miscellaneous things, <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0055" n="44"/> the
          nature of which he could not distinguish in the gloom. Barney Bill presently
          turned and dumped an armful of books on the footboard an inch or two below
          Paul's nose. Paul scanned the title pages. They were: Goldsmith's "Animated
          Nature," "Enquire Within Upon Everything," an old bound volume of "Cassell's
          Family Reader," "The Remains of Henry Kirke White," and "Martin Chuzzlewit." The
          owner looked down upon them proudly. </p>
        <p>"I've got some more, but I can't get at 'em." </p>
        <p>Paul regarded him with envy. This was a man of great possessions. "How long are
          yo' going to stay here?" he asked hopefully. </p>
        <p>"Till sunrise to-morrow." </p>
        <p>Paul's face fell. He seemed to have no luck nowadays. </p>
        <p>Barney Bill let himself down to a sitting position on the footboard and reached
          to the end for a huge pork pie and a clasp knife which lay beside a tin can.
          "I'll go on with my supper," said he; then noticing a wistful, hungry look in
          the child's eyes, "Have a bit?" he asked. </p>
        <p>He cut off a mighty hunk and put it into Paul's ready hand. Paul perched
          himself beside him, and they both ate for a long while in silence, dangling
          their legs. Now and again the host passed the tin of tea to wash down the food.
          The flaming dragon died into a smoky red above the town. A light or two already
          appeared in the fringe of mean houses. Twilight fell rapidly. </p>
        <p>"Oughtn't you to be getting home?" </p>
        <p>Paul, his hunger appeased, grinned. His idea was to sneak into the scullery
          just after the public-houses closed, when his mother would be far too much
          occupied with Mr. Button to worry about him. Chastisement would then be
          postponed till the morning. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0056" n="Illustration"/>
          <!--<head>They both ate for a long while in silence, dangling their legs.</head>-->
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0057"/>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0058" n="45"/> Artlessly he laid the situation before
          his friend, who led him on to relate other amenities of his domestic life. </p>
        <p>"Well, I'm jiggered!" said Barney Bill. "She must be a she-devil!" </p>
        <p>Paul cordially agreed. He had already imagined the Prince of Darkness in the
          guise of Mr. Button; Mrs. Button was in every way fit to be the latter's
          diabolical mate. Encouraged by sympathy and shrewd questions, he sketched in
          broad detail his short career, glorifying himself as the prize scholar and the
          erstwhile Grand Llama of Budge Street, and drawing a dismal picture of the
          factory. Barney Bill listened comprehendingly. Then, smoking a well-blackened
          clay, he began to utter maledictions on the suffocating life in towns and to
          extol his own manner of living. Having an appreciative audience, he grew
          eloquent over his lonely wanderings the length and breadth of the land; over the
          joy of country things, the sweetness of the fields, the wayside flowers, the
          vaulted highways in the leafy summer, the quiet, sleepy towns, the fragrant
          villages, the peace and cleanness of the open air. </p>
        <p>The night had fallen, and in the cleared sky the stars shone bright. Paul, his
          head against the lintel of the van door, looked up at them, enthralled by the
          talk of Barney Bill. The vagabond merchant had the slight drawling inflection of
          the Home Counties, which gave a soothing effect to a naturally soft voice. To
          Paul it was the pipes of Pan. </p>
        <p>"It mightn't suit everybody," said Barney Bill philosophically. "Some folks
          prefer gas to laylock. I don't say that they're wrong. But I likes laylock." </p>
        <p>"What's laylock?" asked Paul. </p>
        <p>His friend explained. No lilac bloomed in the blighted Springs of Bludston. </p>
        <p>"Does it smell sweet?" </p>
        <p>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0059" n="46"/> "Yuss. So does the may and the syringa
          and the new-mown hay and the seaweed. Never smelt any of 'em ?" </p>
        <p>"No," sighed Paul, sensuously conscious of new and vague horizons. "I once
          smelled summat sweet," he said dreamily. "It wur a lady." </p>
        <p>"D'ye mean a woman?" </p>
        <p>"No. A lady. Like what yo' read of." </p>
        <p>"I've heard as they do smell good; like violets&mdash;some on 'em," the
          philosopher remarked. </p>
        <p>Drawn magnetically to this spiritual brother, Paul said almost without
          volition, "She said I were the son of a prince." </p>
        <p>"Son of a <hi rend="italic">WOT</hi>?" cried Barney Bill, sitting up with a
          jerk that shook a volume or two onto the ground. </p>
        <p>Paul repeated the startling word. </p>
        <p>"Lor' lumme!" exclaimed the other, "don't yer know who yer father was?" </p>
        <p>Paul told of his disastrous attempts to pierce the mystery of his birth. </p>
        <p>"A frying-pan? Did she now? That's a mother for yer." </p>
        <p>Paul disowned her. He disowned her with reprehensible emphasis. </p>
        <p>Barney Bill pulled reflectively at his pipe. Then he laid a bony hand on the
          boy's shoulder. "Who do you think yer mother was?" he asked gravely. "A princess
          ?" </p>
        <p>"Ay, why not?" said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Why not?" echoed Barney Bill. "Why not? You're a blooming lucky kid. I wish I
          was a missin' heir. I know what I'd do." </p>
        <p>"What?" asked Paul, the ingenuous. </p>
        <p>"I'd find my 'igh-born parents." </p>
        <p>"How?" asked Paul. </p>
        <p>"I'd go through the whole of England, asking all <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0060" n="47"/> the princes I met. You don't meet 'em at
          every village pump, ye know," he added quickly, lest the boy, detecting the
          bantering note, should freeze into reserve; "but, if you keep yer eyes skinned
          and yer ears standing up, you can learn where they are. Lor' lumme! I wouldn't
          be a little nigger slave in a factory if I was the missin' heir. Not much. I
          wouldn't be starved and beaten by Sam and Polly Button. Not me. D'ye think yer
          aforesaid 'igh-born parents are going to dive down into this stinkin' suburb of
          hell to find yer out? Not likely. You've got to find 'em ' sonny. Yer can find
          anybody on the 'ighroad if yer tramps long enough. What d'yer think?" </p>
        <p>"I'll find 'em," said Paul, in dizzy contemplation of possibilities. </p>
        <p>"When are yer going to start?" asked Barney Bill. </p>
        <p>Paul felt his wages jingle in his pocket. He was a capitalist. The thrill of
          independence swept him from head to foot. What time like the present? "I'll
          start now ' " said he. </p>
        <p>It was night. Quite dark, save for the stars; the lights already disappearing
          in the fringe of mean houses whose outline was merged against the blackness of
          the town; the green and red and white disks along the railway line behind the
          dim mass of the gasworks; the occasional streak of conglomerate fireflies that
          was a tramcar; and the red, remorseless glow of here and there a furnace that
          never was extinct in the memory of man. And, save for the far shriek of trains,
          the less remote and more frequent clanging of passing tramcars along the road
          edged with the skeleton cottages, and, startlingly near, the vain munching and
          dull footfall of the old horse, all was still. Compared with home and Budge
          Street, it was the reposeful quiet of the tomb. Barney Bill smoked for a time in
          silence, while Paul sat with clenched fists and a beating <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0061" n="48"/> heart. The simplicity of the high
          adventure dazed him. All he had to do was to walk away&mdash;walk and walk,
          free as a sparrow. </p>
        <p>Presently Barney Bill slid from the footboard. "You stay here, sonny, till I
          come back." </p>
        <p>He limped away across the dim brickfield and sat down at the edge of the hollow
          where the woman had been murdered. He had to think; to decide a nice point of
          ethics. A vagrant seller of brooms and jute mats, even though he does carry
          about with him "Cassell's Family Reader" and "The Remains of Henry Kirke White,"
          is distracted by few psychological problems. Sufficient for the day is the
          physical thereof. And when a man like Barney Bill is unencumbered by the
          continuous feminine, the ordinary solution of life is simple. But now the man
          had to switch his mind back to times before Paul was born, when the eternal
          feminine had played the very devil with him, when all sorts of passions and
          emotions had whirled his untrained being into dizziness. No passions or emotions
          now affected him; but their memory created an atmosphere of puzzledom. He had to
          adjust values. He had to deputize for Destiny. He also had to harmonize the
          pathetically absurd with the grimly real. He took off his cap and scratched his
          cropped head. After a while he damned something indefinite and hastened in his
          dot-and-carry-one fashion to the van. </p>
        <p>"Quite made up yer mind to go in search of yer 'ighborn parents?" </p>
        <p>"Ay," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Like me to give yer a lift, say, as far as London?" </p>
        <p>Paul sprang to the ground and opened his mouth to speak. But his knees grew
          weak and he quivered all over like one who beholds the god. The abstract
          nebulous romance of his pilgrimage had been crystallized, in a flash, into the
          concrete. "Ay," he panted. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0062" n="49"/>
        </p>
        <p>"Ay!" and he steadied himself with his back and elbows against the shafts. </p>
        <p>"That's all right," said Barney Bill, in a matter-of fact way, calm and godlike
          to Paul. "You can make up a bed on the floor of the old 'bus with some of them
          there mats inside and we'll turn in and have a sleep, and start at sunrise." </p>
        <p>He clambered into the van, followed by Paul, and lit an oil lamp. In a few
          moments Paul's bed was made. He threw himself down. The resilient surface of the
          mats was luxury after the sacking on the scullery stone. Barney Bill performed
          his summary toilet, blew out the lamp and went to his couch. </p>
        <p>Presently Paul started up, smitten by a pang straight through his heart. He
          sprang to his feet. "Mister," he cried in the darkness, not knowing how else to
          address his protector. "I mun go whoam." </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">"Wot</hi>?" exclaimed the other. "Thought better of it
          already? Well, go, then, yer little 'eathen 'ippocrite !" </p>
        <p>"I'll coom back," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Yer afeared, yer little rat," said Barney Bill, out of the blackness. </p>
        <p>"I'm not," retorted Paul indignantly. "I'm freeten'd of nowt." </p>
        <p>"Then what d'yer want to go for? If you've made up yer mind to come along of
          me, just stay where you are. If you go home they'll nab you and whack you for
          staying out late, and lock you up, and you'll not be able to get out in time in
          the morning. And I ain't a-going to wait for yer, I tell yer straight." </p>
        <p>"I'll be back," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Don't believe it. Good mind not to let yer go." </p>
        <p>The touch of genius suddenly brushed the boy's forehead. He drew from his
          pockets the handful of silver and copper that was his week's wages, and, groping
          in <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0063" n="50"/> the darkness, poured it over Barney
          Bill. "Then keep that for me till I coom back." </p>
        <p>He fumbled hurriedly for the latch of the van door, found it, and leaped out
          into the waste under the stars, just as the owner of the van rose with a clatter
          of coins. To pick up money is a deeply rooted human instinct. Barney Bill lit
          his lamp, and, uttering juicy though innocuous flowers of anathema, searched for
          the scattered treasure. When he had retrieved three shillings and
          sevenpence-halfpenny he peered out. Paul was far away. Barney Bill put the money
          on the shelf and looked at it in a puzzled way. Was it an earnest of the boy's
          return, or was it a bribe to let him go? The former hypothesis seemed untenable,
          for if he got nabbed his penniless condition would be such an aggravation of his
          offence as to call down upon him a more ferocious punishment than he need have
          risked. And why in the name of sanity did he want to go home? To kiss his
          sainted mother in her sleep? To pack his blankety portmanteau? Barney Bill's
          fancy took a satirical turn. On the latter hypothesis, the boy was in deadly
          fear, and preferred the certainty of the ferocious punishment to the terrors of
          an unknown future. Barney Bill smoked a reflective pipe, looking at the matter
          from the two points of view. Not being able to decide, he put out his lamp, shut
          his door and went to sleep. </p>
        <p>Dawn awoke him. He sat up and rubbed his eyes. Paul was not there. He did not
          expect him to be there. He felt sorry. The poor little kid had funked it. He had
          hoped for better stuff. He rose and stretched himself, put on socks and boots,
          lit his cooking stove, set a kettle to boil and, opening the door, remained for
          a while breathing the misty morning air. Then he let himself down and proceeded
          to the back of the van, where stood a pail of water and a tin basin, <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0064" n="51"/> his simple washing apparatus. Having
          sluiced bead and neck and dried them with something resembling a towel, he
          hooked up the pail, stowed the basin in a rack, unslung a nosebag, which he
          attached to the head of the old horse, and went indoors to prepare his own
          elementary breakfast. That over, he put the horse into the shafts. Barney Bill
          was a man of his word. He was not going to wait for Paul; but lie cast a glance
          round the limited horizon of the brickfield, hoping, against reason, to see the
          little slim figure emerge from some opening and run toward him. </p>
        <p>"Darn the boy!" said Barney Bill, taking off his cap and scratching his wet
          head. </p>
        <p>A low moan broke the dead silence of the Sunday dawn. He started and looked
          about him. He listened. There was another. The moans were those of a sleeper. He
          bent down and looked under the van. There Jay Paul, huddled up, fast asleep on
          the bare ground. </p>
        <p>"Well, I'm jiggered! I'm just jiggered. Here, you&mdash;hello!" cried
          Barney Bill. </p>
        <p>Paul awakened suddenly, half sat up, grinned, grabbed at something on the
          ground beside him and wriggled out between the wheels. </p>
        <p>"How long you been there?" </p>
        <p>"About two hours," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Why didn't yer wake me?" </p>
        <p>"I didn't like to disturb thee," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Did yer go home?" </p>
        <p>"Ay," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Into the house?" </p>
        <p>Paul nodded and smiled. Now, that it was all over, he could smile. But only
          afterwards, when he had greater command of language, could he describe the awful
          terror that shook his soul when he opened the front door, crept twice through
          the darkness of the sleeping kitchen and noiselessly closed the door again. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0065" n="52"/>
        </p>
        <p>For many months he felt the terror of his dreams. Briefly he told Barney Bill
          of his exploit. How he had to lurk in the shadow of the street during the end of
          a battle between the Buttons, in which the lodgers and a policeman had
          intervened. How he had to wait&mdash;interminable hours&mdash;until the
          house was quiet. How he had stumbled over things in the drunken disorder of the
          kitchen floor, dreading to arouse the four elder little Buttons who slept in the
          room. How narrowly he had missed running into the arms of the policeman who had
          passed the door some seconds before he opened it. How he had crouched on the
          pavement until the policeman turned the corner, and how he had fled in the
          opposite direction. </p>
        <p>"And if yer mother had caught ye, what would she have done to yer?" </p>
        <p>"Half-killed me," said Paul. </p>
        <p>Barney Bill twisted his head on one side and looked at him out of his twinkling
          eyes. Paul thought he resembled a grotesque bird. </p>
        <p>"Wot did yer do it <hi rend="italic">for</hi>?" he asked. </p>
        <p>"This," said Paul, holding out a grubby palm in which lay the precious
          cornelian heart. </p>
        <p>His friend blinked at it. "Wot the blazes is the good of that?" </p>
        <p>"It's a talisman," replied Paul, who, having come across the word in a book,
          had at once applied it to his treasure. </p>
        <p>"Lor' lumme!" cried Barney Bill. "And it was for that bit of stuff yer ran the
          risk of being flayed alive by yer loving parents?" </p>
        <p>Paul was quick to detect a note of admiration underlying the superficial
          contemptuousness of the words. "I'd ha' gone through fire and water for it," he
          declared theatrically. </p>
        <p>"Lor' lumme!" said Barney Bill again. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0066" n="53"/>
        </p>
        <p>"I got summat else," said Paul, taking from his pocket his little pack of
          Sunday-school cards. </p>
        <p>Barney Bill examined them gravely. "I think you'd better do away with these." </p>
        <p>"Why?" </p>
        <p>"They establishes yer identity," said Barney Bill. </p>
        <p>"What's that ?" </p>
        <p>Barney Bill explained. Paul was running away from home. The police, informed of
          the fact, would raise a hue-and-cry. The cards, if found, would be evidence.
          Paul laughed. The constabulary was not popular in Budge Street. </p>
        <p>"Mother ain't going to ha' nowt to do with the police, nor father, either." </p>
        <p>He hinted that the cards might be useful later. His childish vanity loved the
          trivial encomiums inscribed thereon. They would impress beholders who had not
          the same reasons for preoccupation as Barney Bill. </p>
        <p>"You're thinking of your 'igh-born parents," said Barney Bill. "All right, keep
          'em. Only hide 'ern away safe. And now get in and let us clear out of this
          place. It smelts like a cheese with an escape of gas running through it. And
          you'd better stay inside and not show your face all day long. I don't want to be
          had up for kidnapping." </p>
        <p>Paul jumped in. Barney Bill clambered onto the footboard and took the reins.
          The old horse started and the van jolted its way to the road, on which as yet no
          tramcars clattered. As the van turned, Paul, craning his neck out of the window,
          obtained the last glimpse of Bludston. He had no regrets. As far as such a
          thought could be formulated in his young mind, he wished that the place could be
          blotted out from his memory, as it was now hidden forever from his vision. He
          stood at the little window, facing south, gazing toward the unknown region at
          the end of which lay <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0067" n="54"/> London, city of
          dreams. He was not quite fourteen. His destiny was before him, and to the
          fulfilment thereof he saw no hindrance. No more would the remorseless factory
          hook catch him from his sleep and swing him into the relentless machine. Never
          again, would he hear his mother's shrewish voice or feel her heavy, greasy hand
          about his ears. He was free&mdash;free to read, free to sleep, free to talk,
          free to drink in the beauty of the lazy hours. Vaguely he was conscious that one
          of the wonders that would come would be his own expansion. He would learn many
          things which he did not know, things that would fit him for his high estate. He
          looked down upon the foreshortened figure of Barney Bill, his cloth cap, his
          shoulders, his bare brown arms, a patch of knee. To the boy, at that moment, he
          was less a man than an instrument of Destiny guiding him, not knowing why, to
          the Promised Land. </p>
        <p>At last on the quiet road Paul saw a bicyclist approaching them. Mindful of
          Barney Bill's injunction, he withdrew his head. Presently he lay down on the
          couch, and, soothed by the jogging of the van and the pleasant creaking of the
          baskets, fell into the deep sleep of tired and happy childhood. </p>

        <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0068" n="55"/>
        <head>CHAPTER IV</head>

        <p>IT was a day of dust and blaze. Dust lay thick on the ground, it filled the
          air, it silvered the lower branches of the wayside trees, it turned the old
          brown horse into a dappled grey, it powdered the black hair of Barney Bill and
          of Paul until they looked like vagabond millers. They sat side by side on the
          footboard while the old horse jogged on, whisking flies away with a scanty but
          persistent tail. </p>
        <p>Paul, barefoot and barelegged, hatless, coatless, absorbed blaze and dust with
          the animal content of a young lizard. A month's summer wandering had baked him
          to gipsy brown. A month's sufficient food and happiness had filled gaunt hollows
          in his face and covered all too visible ribs with flesh. Since his flight from
          Bludston his life had been one sensuous trance. His hungry young soul had been
          gorged with beauty&mdash;the beauty of fields and trees and rolling country,
          of still, quivering moons and starlit nights, of exultant freedom, of
          never-failing human sympathy. He had a confused memory of everything. They had
          passed through many towns as similar to Bludston as one factory chimney to
          another, and had plied their trade in many a mean street, so much the
          counterpart of Budge Street that he had watched a certain window or door with
          involuntary trepidation, until he realized that it was not Budge Street, that he
          was a happy alien to its squalor, that he was a butterfly, a thing of woods and
          hedgerows fluttering for an inconsequent moment in the gloom. He came among
          them, none knew whence <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0069" n="56"/> he was going,
          none knew whither. He was conscious of being a creature of mystery. He pitied
          the fettered youth of these begrimed and joyless towns&mdash;slaves, Men
          with Muckrakes (he had fished up ail old "Pilgrim's Progress" from the lower
          depths of the van), who obstinately refused to raise their eyes to the glorious
          sun in heaven. In his childish arrogance he would ask Barney Bill, "Why don't
          they go away and leave it, like me?" And the wizened little man would reply,
          with the flicker of an eyelid unperceived by Paul, "Because they haven't no
          'igh-born parents waiting for 'em. They're born to their low estate, and they
          knows it." Which to Paul was a solution of peculiar comfort. </p>
        <p>Even the blackened lands between the towns had their charm for Paul, in that he
          had a gleeful sense of being excluded from the wrath of God, which fell
          continuously upon them and the inhabitants thereof. And here and there a belt of
          leafy country gave promise, or confirmed Barney Bill's promise, of the Paradise
          that would come. Besides, what mattered the perpetuations of Bludston
          brickfields when the Land of Beulah shimmered ahead in the blue distance, when
          "Martin Chuzzlewit" lay open on his knees, when the smell of the bit of steak
          sizzling on the cooking stove stung his young blood? And now they were in
          Warwickshire, county of verdant undulations and deep woods and embowered
          villages. Every promise that Barney Bill had made to him of beauty was in
          process of fulfilment. There were no more blighted towns, no more factories, no
          more chimneys belching forth smoke. This was the Earth, the real broad-bosomed
          Mother Earth. What he had left was the Hell upon Earth. What he was going to
          might be Paradise, but Paul's imagination rightly boggled at the conception of a
          Paradise more <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0070" n="57"/> perfect. And, as Paul's
          prescient wit had conjectured, he was learning many things; the names of trees
          and wild flowers, the cries of birds, the habits of wayside beasts; what was
          good for a horse to eat and what was bad; which was the Waggon, and Orion's Belt
          and the Bunch of Keys in the heavens; how to fry bacon and sew up rents in his
          clothing; how to deal with his fellow-man, or, rather, with his fellow-woman, in
          a persuasive manner; how to snare a rabbit or a pheasant and convert it into
          food, and how, at the same time, to evade the terrors of the law; the
          differences between wheat and oats and barley; the main lines of cleavage
          between political parties, hitherto a puzzle to Paul, for Barney Bill was a
          politician (on the Conservative side) and read his newspaper and argued craftily
          in taverns; and the styles and titles of great landowners by whose estates they
          passed; and how to avoid the nets that were perpetually spread by a predatory
          sex before the feet of the incautious male. On the last point Barney Bill was
          eloquent; but Paul, with delicious memories sanctifying his young soul, turned a
          deaf ear to his misogyny. Barney Bill was very old and crooked and dried up;
          what beautiful lady would waste her blandishments on him? Even the low-born
          lasses with whom they at times consorted had scarce an eye for Barney Bill. The
          grapes were sour. Paul smiled indulgently on the little foible of his friend. </p>
        <p>They jogged along the highroad on this blazing and dusty day. Their bower of
          wicker chairs crackled in the heat. It was too hot for sustained conversation.
          Once Barney Bill said: "If Bob"-Bob was the old horse's unimaginative
          name&mdash; "if Bob doesn't have a drink soon his darned old hide'll crack." </p>
        <p>Ten minutes later: "Nothing under a quart'll wash down this dust." </p>
        <p>"Have a drink of water," suggested Paul, who had <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0071" n="58"/> already adopted this care for drouth,
          with satisfactory results. </p>
        <p>"A grown man's thirst and a boy's thirst is two entirely different things,"
          said Barney Bill sententiously. "To spoil this grown-up thirst of mine with
          water would be a crime." </p>
        <p>A mile or so farther on the road he stretched out a lean brown arm and pointed.
          "See that there clump of trees? Behind that is the Little Bear Inn. They gives
          you cool china pots with blue round the edge. You can only have 'em if you asks
          for 'em, Jim Blake, the landlord, being pertickler-like. And if yer breaks
          em&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"What would happen?" asked Paul, who was always very much impressed by Barney
          Bill's detailed knowledge of the roads and the inns of England. </p>
        <p>Barney Bill shook his head. "It would break 'is 'eart. Them pots was being used
          when William the Conqueror was a boy." </p>
        <p>"Ten-sixty-six to ten-eighty-seven," said Paul the scholar. "They mun be nine
          hundred years old." </p>
        <p>"Not quite," said Barney Bill, with an air of scrupulous desire for veracity.
          "But nearly. Lor' lumme!" he exclaimed, after a pause, "it makes one think,
          doesn't it? One of them there quart mugs&mdash;suppose it has been filled,
          say, ten times a day, every day for nine hundred years&mdash;my Gosh! what a
          Pacific Ocean of beer must have been poured from it! It makes one come over all
          of religious-like when one puts it to one's head." </p>
        <p>Paul did not reply, and reverential emotion kept Barney Bill silent until they
          reached the clump of trees and the Little Bear Inn. </p>
        <p>It was set back from the road, in a kind of dusty courtyard masked off on one
          side by a gigantic elm and on the other by the fringe of an orchard with ruddy
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0072" n="59"/> apples hanging patiently beneath the
          foliage. Close by the orchard stood the post bearing the signboard on which the
          Little Bear, an engaging beast, was pictured, and presiding in a ceremonious way
          over the horse-trough below. In the shade of the elm stretched a trestle table
          and two wooden benches. The old inn, gabled, half-timbered, its upper story
          overhanging the doorway, bent and crippled, though serene, with age, mellow in
          yellow and russet, spectacled, as befitted its years, with leaded diamond panes,
          crowned deep in secular thatch, smiled with the calm and homely peace of
          everlasting things. Its old dignity even covered the perky gilt inscription over
          the doorway, telling how James Blake was licensed to sell a variety of alcoholic
          beverages. One human figure alone was visible, as the chairs and mat-laden van
          slowly turned from the road toward the horse-trough&mdash;that of a young
          man in straw hat and grey flannels making a water-colour sketch of the inn. </p>
        <p>Barney Bill slid off the footboard, and, looking neither to right nor left,
          bolted like a belated crab into the cool recesses of the bar in search of
          ambrosia from the blue-and-white china mug. Paul, also afoot, led Bob to the
          trough. Bob drank with the lusty moderation of beasts. When he had assuaged his
          thirst Paul backed him into the road and, slinging over his head a comforting
          nosebag, left him to his meal. </p>
        <p>The young man, sitting on an upturned wooden case, at the extreme edge of the
          elm tree's shade, a slender easel before him, a litter of paraphernalia on the
          ground by his side, painted assiduously. Paul idly crept behind him and watched
          in amazement the smears of wet colour, after a second or two of apparent
          irrelevance, take their place in the essential structure of the drawing. He
          stood absorbed. He knew that there were such things as pictures. He <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0073" n="60"/> knew, too, that they were made by hands.
          But he had never seen one in the making. After a while the artist threw back his
          head, looked at the inn and looked at his sketch. There was a hot bit of thatch
          at the corner near the orchard, and, below the eaves, bold shadow. The shadow
          had not come right. He put in a touch of burnt umber and again considered the
          effect. </p>
        <p>"Confound it! that's all wrong," he muttered. </p>
        <p>"It's blue," said Paul. </p>
        <p>The artist started, twisted his head, and for the first time became conscious
          of the ragamuffin's presence. "Oh, you see it blue, do you?" He smiled
          ironically. </p>
        <p>"Ay," said Paul, with pointing finger. "Look at it. It's not brown, anyhow.
          Yon's black inside and blue outside." </p>
        <p>The young man shaded his brow and gazed intently. Brilliant sunshine plays the
          deuce with tones. "My hat!" cried he, "you're right. It was this confounded
          yellow of the side of the house." He put in a few hasty strokes. "That better?" </p>
        <p>"Ay," said Paul. </p>
        <p>The artist laid down his brush, and swung round on his box, clasping knees.
          "How the devil did you manage to see that when I didn't?" </p>
        <p>"Dun-no!" said Paul. </p>
        <p>The young man stretched himself and lit a cigarette. </p>
        <p>"What are yo' doing that for, mister?" Paul asked seriously. </p>
        <p>"That?" </p>
        <p>"Ay," said Paul. "You mun have a reason." </p>
        <p>"You're a queer infant," laughed the artist. "Do you really want to know?" </p>
        <p>"I've asked yo'," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Well, if you're anxious to know, I'm an architect <pb

          <!--<head> The artist started and for the first time became conscious of the

          <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0076" n="61"/> on a holiday, and I'm sketching any
          old thing I come across. I don't pretend to be a painter, my youthful virtuoso,
          and that's why I go wrong sometimes on colour. Do you know what an architect
          is?" </p>
        <p>"No," said Paul, eagerly. "What is it?" </p>
        <p>He had been baffled by the meaning of the word, which he had seen all his life,
          inscribed on a brass plate in the Bludston High Street: "E. Thomson, Architect
          &amp; Surveyor." It had seemed to him odd, cryptically fascinating. </p>
        <p>The young man laughed and explained; Paul listened seriously. Another mystery
          was solved. He had often wondered how the bricklayers knew where to lay the
          bricks. He grasped the idea that they were but instruments carrying out the
          conception of the architect's brain. "I'd like to be an architect," he said. </p>
        <p>"Would you?" After a pause the young man continued: "Anyhow, you can earn a
          shilling. just sit down there and let me make a sketch of you." </p>
        <p>"What for?" asked Paul. </p>
        <p>"Because you're a picturesque person. Now, I suppose you'll be asking me what's
          the meaning of picturesque?" </p>
        <p>"Nay," said Paul. "I know. Yo' see it in books. 'Th' owd grey tower stood out
          picturesque against the crimson sky.' " </p>
        <p>"Hullo! you're a literary gent," said the young man. </p>
        <p>"Ay," replied Paul proudly. He was greatly attracted towards this new
          acquaintance, whom, by his speech and dress and ease of manner, he judged to
          belong to the same caste as his lost but ever-remembered goddess. </p>
        <p>The young man picked up pencil and sketch-book and posed Paul at the end of the
          seat by the trestle table. "Now, then," said he, setting to work. "Head <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0077" n="62"/> a little more that way. Capital. Don't
          move. If you're very quiet I'll give you a shilling." Presently he asked, "What
          are you? If you hadn't been a literary gent I'd have thought you might be a
          gipsy." </p>
        <p>Paul flushed and started. "I'm not a gipsy." </p>
        <p>"Steady, steady," exclaimed the artist. "I've just said you couldn't be one.
          Italian? You don't look English." </p>
        <p>For the first time the idea of exotic parentage entered Paul's head. He dallied
          for a moment or two with the thought. "I dunno what I am," he said romantically. </p>
        <p>"Oh? What's your father?" The young man motioned with his head toward the inn. </p>
        <p>"Yon's not my father," said Paul. "It's only Barney Bill." </p>
        <p>"Only Barney Bill?" echoed the other, amused. "Well, who is your father?" </p>
        <p>"Dunno," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"And your mother?" </p>
        <p>"Dunno, either," said Paul, in a mysterious tone. "I dunno if my parents are
          living or dead. I think they're living." </p>
        <p>"That's interesting. What are you doing with what's-his-name Bill?" </p>
        <p>"I'm just travelling wi' him to London." </p>
        <p>"And what are you going to do in London?" </p>
        <p>"I'll see when I get there," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"So you're out for adventure?" </p>
        <p>"Ay," said the boy, a gleam of the Vision dancing before his eyes. "That's it.
          I'm going on an adventure. " </p>
        <p>"There, keep like that," cried the artist. "Don't stir. I do believe I'm
          getting you. Holy Moses, it will be great! If only I could catch the expression!
          There's nothing like adventure, is there? The glorious <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0078" n="63"/> uncertainty of it! To wake up in the
          morning and know that the unexpected is bound to happen during the day.
          Exciting, isn't it?" </p>
        <p>"Ay," said Paul, his face aglow. </p>
        <p>The young man worked tense and quick at the luminous eyes. He broke a long
          silence by asking, "What's your name?" </p>
        <p>"Paul Kegworthy." </p>
        <p>"Paul? That's odd." In the sphere of life to which the ragged urchin belonged
          Toms and Bills and Jims were as thick as blackberries, but Pauls were rare. </p>
        <p>"What's odd?" said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Your name. How did you get it? It's uncommon." </p>
        <p>"I suppose it is," said Paul. "I never thowt of it. I never knew anybody of
          that name afore." </p>
        <p>Here was another sign and token of romantic origin suddenly revealed. Paul felt
          the thrill of it. He resisted a temptation to ask his new friend whether it was
          an appellation generally reserved for princes. </p>
        <p>"Look here, joking apart," said the artist, putting in the waves of the thick
          black hair, "are you really going to be dumped down in London to seek your
          fortune? Don't you know anybody there?" </p>
        <p>"No," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"How are you going to live?" </p>
        <p>Paul dived a hand into his breeches pocket and jingled coins. "I've got th'
          brass," said he. </p>
        <p>"How much?" </p>
        <p>"Three shillings and sevenpence-ha'penny," said Paul, with an opulent air. "And
          yo'r shilling will make it four and sevenpence-ha'penny." </p>
        <p>"Good God!" said -the young man. He went on drawing for some time in silence.
          Then he said: "My brother is a painter&mdash;rather a swell&mdash;a
          Royal Academician. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0079" n="64"/> He would love to
          paint you. So would other fellows. You could easily earn your living as a
          model&mdash;doing as a business, you know, what you're doing now for fun,
          more or less." </p>
        <p>"How much could I earn?" </p>
        <p>"It all depends. Say a pound to thirty shillings a week." </p>
        <p>Paul gasped and sat paralyzed. Artist, dusty road, gaudy van, distant
          cornfields and uplands were blotted from his senses. The cool waves of Pactolus
          lapped his feet. </p>
        <p>"Come and look me up when you get to London," continued the friendly voice. "My
          name is Rowlatt -W. W. Rowlatt, 4, Gray's Inn Square. Can you remember it?" </p>
        <p>"Ay," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Shall I write it down?" </p>
        <p>"Nay. 'W. W. Rowlatt, 4, Gray's Inn Square.' I'm noan likely to forget it. I
          never forget nowt," said Paul, life returning through a vein of boastfulness. </p>
        <p>"Tell me all you remember," said Mr. Rowlatt, with a laugh. </p>
        <p>"I can say all the Kings of England, with their dates, and the counties and
          chief towns of Great Britain and Ireland, and all the weights and measures, and
          'The Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold&mdash;' " </p>
        <p>"Holy Moses!" cried Rowlatt. "Anything else?" </p>
        <p>"Ay. Lots more," said Paul, anxious to stamp vividly the impression he saw that
          he was making. "I know the Plagues of Egypt." </p>
        <p>"I bet you don't." </p>
        <p>"Rivers of Blood, Frogs, Lice, Flies, Murrain, Boils, Hails, Locusts, Darkness
          and Death of Firstborn," said Paul, in a breath. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0080" n="65"/>
        </p>
        <p>"Jehosaphat !" cried Rowlatt. "I suppose now you'd have no difficulty in
          reciting the Thirty-nine Articles." </p>
        <p>Paul puckered his forehead in thought. "D'yo' mean," he asked after a pause,
          "the Thirty-nine Articles o' Religion, as is in th' Prayerbuk? I ha' tried to
          read 'em, but couldno' understand 'em reet." </p>
        <p>Rowlatt, who had not expected his facetious query to be so answered, stopped
          his drawing for a moment. "What in the name of goodness attracted you to the
          Thirty-nine Articles?" </p>
        <p>"I wanted to learn about things," said Paul. </p>
        <p>The young man looked at him and smiled. "Self-education is a jolly good thing,"
          said he. "Learn all you can, and you'll be a famous fellow one of these days.
          But you must cultivate a sense of humour." </p>
        <p>Paul was about to seek enlightenment as to this counsel when Barney Bill
          appeared, cool and refreshed, from the inn door, and lifted a cheery voice.
          "Let's be getting along, sonny." </p>
        <p>Rowlatt held up a detaining hand. "Just a couple of minutes, if you can spare
          them. I've nearly finished." </p>
        <p>"All right, sir," said Barney Bill, limping across the yard. "Taking a picture
          of him ?" </p>
        <p>The artist nodded. Barney Bill looked over his shoulder. "By Gosh!" he cried in
          admiration. "By Gosh!" </p>
        <p>"It has come out rather well, hasn't it?" said the artist, complacently. </p>
        <p>"It's the living image of 'im," said Barney Bill. </p>
        <p>"He tells me he's going up to London to seek his fortune," said Rowlatt,
          putting in the finishing touches. </p>
        <p>"And his 'igh-born parents," said Barney Bill, winking at Paul. </p>
        <p>Paul flushed and wriggled uncomfortably. Instinct <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0081" n="66"/> deprecated crude revelation of the
          mystery of his birth to the man of refinement. He felt that Barney Bill was
          betraying confidence. Gutter-bred though he was, he accused his vagrant
          protector of a lack of good taste. Of such a breach he himself, son of princes,
          could not have been guilty. Luckily, and, as Paul thought, with admirable tact,
          Mr. Rowlatt did not demand explanation. </p>
        <p>"A young Japhet in search of a father. Well, I hope he'll find him. There's
          nothing like romance. Without it life is flat and dead. It's what atmosphere is
          to a picture." </p>
        <p>"And onions to a stew," said Barney Bill. </p>
        <p>"Quite right," said Rowlatt. "Paul, my boy, I think after all you'd better
          stick to Mr.&mdash;?" </p>
        <p>"Barney Bill, sir, at your service. And, if you want a comfortable chair, or an
          elegant mat, or a hearth brush at a ridiculous cheap price"&mdash;he waved
          toward the van. Rowlatt turned his head and, laughing, looked into the twinkling
          black eyes. "I don't for a moment expect you to buy, sir, but I was only
          a-satisfying of my artistic conscience." </p>
        <p>Rowlatt shut his sketch-book with a snap, and rose. "Let us have a drink," said
          he. "Artists should be better acquainted." </p>
        <p>He whispered a message to Paul, who sped to the inn and presently returned with
          a couple of the famous blue and white mugs frothing deliciously at the brims.
          The men, their lips to the bubbles, nodded to each other. The still beat of the
          August noon enveloped their bodies, but a streak of heavenly coolness trickled
          through their souls. Paul, looking at them enviously, longed to be grown up. </p>
        <p>Then followed a pleasant half-hour of desultory talk. Although the men did not
          make him, save for here and there a casual reference, the subject of their <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0082" n="67"/> conversation, Paul, with the Vision
          shimmering before his eyes, was sensitive enough to perceive in a dim and
          elusive way that he was at the back of each man's thoughts and that, for his
          sake, each was trying to obtain the measure of the other. At last Barney Bill,
          cocking at the sun the skilled eye of the dweller in the wilderness, called the
          time for departure. </p>
        <p>"Could I see th' picture?" asked Paul. </p>
        <p>Rowlatt passed him the sketch-book. The sudden sight of oneself as one appears
          in another's eyes is always a shock, even to the most sophisticated sitter. To
          Paul it was uncanny. He had often seen his own reflection and was familiar with
          his own appearance, but this was the first time that he had looked at himself
          impersonally. The sketch was vivid, the likeness excellent; the motive, the
          picturesque and romantic. </p>
        <p>A proud lift of the chin, an eager glance in the eye, a sensitive curve of the
          lip attracted his boyish egotism. The portrait was an ideal, something to live
          up to. Involuntarily he composed his features. </p>
        <p>Barney Bill again called time. Paul surrendered the sketch-book reluctantly.
          Rowlatt, with a cheery word, handed him the shilling fee. Paul, than whom none
          better knew the magic quality of money, hesitated for a second. The boy in the
          sketch would have refused. Paul drew himself up. "Nay, I'll take noan. I liked
          doing it." </p>
        <p>Rowlatt laughed and pocketed the coin. "All right," said he, with a playful
          bow. "I'm exceedingly indebted to your courtesy." </p>
        <p>Barney Bill gave Paul an approving glance. "Good for you, boy. Never take money
          you've not earned. Good day to you, sir"&mdash;he touched his cap.
          "And"&mdash;with a motion toward the empty mugs&mdash;"thank you
          kindly." </p>
        <p>Rowlatt strolled with them to the van, Barney Bill <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0083" n="68"/> limping a pace or two ahead. "Remember
          what I told you, my young friend," said he in a low voice. "I don't go back upon
          my word. I'll help you. But if you're a wise boy and know what's good for you,
          you'll stick to Mr. Barney Bill and the freedom of the high-road and the light
          heart of the vagabond. You'll have a devilish sight more happiness in the end." </p>
        <p>But Paul, who already looked upon his gipsy self as dead as his Bludston self,
          and these dead selves as stepping-stones to higher things, turned a deaf ear to
          his new friend's paradoxical philosophy. "I'll remember," said he. "Mr. W. W.
          Rowlatt, 4, Gray's Inn Square." </p>
        <p>The young architect watched the van with its swinging, creaking excrescences
          lumber away down the hot and dusty road, and turned with a puzzled expression to
          his easel. Joy in the Little Bear Inn had for the moment departed. Presently he
          found himself scribbling a letter in pencil to his brother, the Royal
          Academician. </p>
        <p>"So you see, my dear fellow," he wrote toward the end of the epistle, "I am in
          a quandary. That the little beggar is of startling beauty is undeniable. That he
          has got his bill agape, like a young bird, for whatever food of beauty and
          emotion and knowledge comes his way is obvious to any fool. But whether, in what
          I propose, I'm giving a helping hand to a kind of wild genius, or whether I'm
          starting a vain boy along the primrose path in the direction of everlasting
          bonfire, I'm damned if I know." </p>
        <p>But Paul jogged along by the side of Barney Bill in no such state of dubiety.
          God was in His Heaven, arranging everything for his especial benefit. All was
          well with the world where dazzling destinies like his were bound to be
          fulfilled. </p>
        <p>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0084" n="69"/> "I've heard of such things," said
          Barney Bill with a reflective twist of his head, when Paul had told him of Mr.
          Rowlatt's suggestion. "A cousin of mine married a man who knew a gal who used to
          stand in her birthday suit in front of a lot of young painter chaps -and I'm
          bound to say he used to declare she was as good a gal as his own wife,
          especially seeing as how she supported an old father what had got a stroke, and
          a houseful of young brothers and sisters. So I'm not saying there's any harm in
          it. And I wouldn't stand in your way, sonny, seeing as how you want to get to
          your 'igh-born parents. You might find 'em. on the road, and then again you
          mightn't. And thirty bob a week at fourteen-no-it would be flying in the face of
          Providence to say 'don't do it! But what licks me is: what the blazes do they
          want with a little varmint like you? Why shouldn't they pay thirty bob a week to
          paint me?" </p>
        <p>Paul did not reply, being instinctively averse from wounding susceptibilities.
          But in his heart rose a high pity for the common though kindly clay that was
          Barney Bill.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER V</head>

        <p>WHEN they reached London in November, after circuitous wanderings, Barney Bill
          said to Paul: "You've seed enough of me, matey, to know that I wish yer good and
          not harm. I've fed yer and I've housed yer-I can't say as how I've done much
          toward clothing yer-and three months on the road has knocked corners off the
          swell toggery yer came to me in; but I ain't beat yer or cussed yer more than
          yer deserved"&mdash;whereat Paul grinned-"and I've spent a lot of valuable
          time, when I might have been profitably doing nothing, a-larning yer of things
          and, so to speak, completing yer eddication. Is that the truth, or am I a
          bloomin' liar?" </p>
        <p>Paul, thus challenged, confirmed the absolute veracity of Barney Bill's
          statement. The latter continued, bending forward, his lean brown hand on the
          boy's shoulder, and looking at him earnestly: "I took yer away from your 'appy
          'ome because, though the 'ome might have been 'appy in its own sweet way, you
          wasn't. I wanted to set yer on the track of yer 'ighborn parents. I wanted to
          make a man of yer. I want to do the best for yer now, so I put it to yer
          straight: If yer likes to come along of me altogether, I'll pay yer wages on the
          next round, and when yer gets a little older I'll take yer into partnership and
          leave yer the business when I die. It's a man's life and a free life, and I
          think yer likes it, don't yer?" </p>
        <p>"Ay," said Paul, "it's foine." </p>
        <p>"On the other hand, as I said afore, I won't stand <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0086" n="71"/> in yer way, and if yer thinks you'll get
          nearer to your 'igh-born parents by hitching up with Mr. Architect,
          well&mdash;you're old enough to choose. I leave it to you." </p>
        <p>But Paul had already chosen. The Road had its magical fascination, to which he
          would have surrendered all his boyish soul, had not the call of his destiny been
          more insistent. The Road led nowhither. Princes and princesses were as rare as
          hips and haws in summer-time. Their glittering equipages did not stop the van,
          nor did they stand at the emblazoned gateways of great parks waiting patiently
          for long-lost sons. He knew that he must seek them in their own social world,
          and to this he would surely be raised by his phantasmagorial income of thirty
          shillings a week. </p>
        <p>"You won't object to my keeping a friendly eye on yer for the next year or
          two?" asked Barney Bill, with twisted mouth and a kindly, satirical glance. </p>
        <p>Paul flushed. He had the consciousness of being a selfish, self-centered little
          beast, not half enough grateful to Barney Bill for delivering him out of the
          House of Bondage and leading him into the Land of Milk and Honey. He was as much
          stung by the delicately implied rebuke as touched by the solicitude as to his
          future welfare. Romantic words, such as he had read in the story-books, surged
          vaguely in his head, but he could find none to utter. He kept silent for a few
          moments, his hand in his breeches pocket. Presently he drew it forth rather
          slowly, and held out the precious cornelian heart to his benefactor. </p>
        <p>"I 'ud like to give it thee," said Paul. </p>
        <p>Barney Bill took it. "Thank 'ee, sonny. I'll remember that you gave it to me.
          But I won't keep yer talisman. 'Ere, see-" he made a pretence to spit on
          it-"that's for luck. Barney Bill's luck, and good wishes." <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0087" n="72"/>
        </p>
        <p>So Paul pocketed the heart again, immensely relieved by his friend's
          magnanimity, and the little sentimental episode was over. </p>
        <p>A month later, when Barney Bill started on his solitary winter pilgrimage in
          the South of England, he left behind him a transmogrified Paul, a Paul, thanks
          to his munificence, arrayed in decent garments, including collar and tie
          (insignia of caste) and an overcoat (symbol of luxury), for which Paul was to
          repay him out of his future earnings; a Paul lodged in a small but comfortable
          third-floor-back, a bedroom all to himself, with a real bed, mattress, pillow,
          sheets ,and blankets all complete, and a looking-glass, and a stand with ewer
          and basin so beautiful that, at first, Paul did not dare wash for fear of making
          the water dirty; a Paul already engaged for a series of sittings by Mr. Cyrus
          Rowlatt, R.A., his head swimming with the wonder of the fashionable painter's
          studio; a Paul standing in radiant confidence upon the brink of life. </p>
        <p>"Sonny," said Barney Bill, when he said good-bye, "d'yer see them there lovely
          lace-up boots you've got on ?" </p>
        <p>"Ay," said Paul, regarding them complacently. </p>
        <p>"Well, they've got to take yer all the way up the hill, like the young man
          what's his name?&mdash;Excelsure &mdash;in the piece of poetry you
          recite; but they'll only do it if they continues to fit. Don't get too big for
          'em. At any rate, wait till they're worn out and yer can buy another pair with
          yer own money." </p>
        <p>Paul grinned, because he did not know what else to do, so as to show his
          intellectual appreciation of the parable; but in his heart, for all his
          gratitude, he thought Barney bill rather a prosy moralizer. It was one of the
          disabilities of advanced old age. Alas! what can bridge the gulf between
          fourteen and fifty? <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0088" n="73"/> "Anyhow, you've
          got a friend at the back of yer, sonny, and don't make no mistake about it. If
          you're in trouble let me know. I can't say fairer than that, can I ?" </p>
        <p>That, for a season, was the end of Barney Bill, and Paul found himself
          thrillingly alone in London. At first its labyrinthine vastness overwhelmed him,
          causing him to feel an unimportant atom, which may have been good for his soul,
          but was not agreeable to his vanity. By degrees, however, he learned the lay of
          the great thoroughfares, especially those leading to the quarters where artists
          congregate, and, conscious of purpose and of money jingling in his pocket, he
          began to hold his head high in the crowded streets. In the house in Barn Street,
          off the Euston Road, where he lodged, he was called "Mr. Paul" by his landlady,
          Mrs. Seddon, and her thirteen-year-old daughter, Jane, which was comforting and
          stimulating. Jane, a lanky, fair, blue-eyed girl, who gave promise of good
          looks, attended to his modest wants with a zeal somewhat out of proportion to
          the payment received. Paul had the novel sensation of finding some one at his
          beck and call. He beckoned and called often, for the sheer pleasure of it. So
          great was the change in his life that, in these early days, it seemed a3 if he
          had already come into his kingdom. He strutted about, poor child, like the
          prince in a fairy tale, and, in spite of Barney Bill's precepts-lie outgrew his
          boots immediately. Mrs. Seddon, an old friend of Barney Bill, whom she addressed
          and spoke as Mr. William, kept a small shop in which she sold newspapers and
          twine and penny bottles of ink. In the little back-parlour Mrs. Seddon and Tane
          and Paul had their mea!s, while the shop boy, an inconsiderable creature with a
          perpetual cold in his head, attended to the unexpected customer. To Paul, this
          boy, with whom a few months ago he <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0089" n="74"/>
          would have joyously changed places, was as the dust beneath his feet. He sent
          him on errands in a lordly way, treating him as, indeed, he had treated the
          youth of Budge Street after his triumph over Billy Goodge, and the boy obeyed
          meekly. Paul believed in himself; the boy didn't. Almost from the beginning he
          usurped an ascendancy over the little household. For all their having lived in
          the great maelstrom of London, he found his superficial experience of life
          larger than that of mother and daughter. They had never seen machinery at work,
          did not know the difference between an elm and a beech and had never read Sir
          Walter Scott. Mrs. Seddon, thin, careworn and slackly good-natured, ever
          lamented the loss of an astonishingly brilliant husband; Jane was markedly the
          more competent of the two. She had character, and, even while slaving for the
          romantic youth, made it clear to him that for no other man alive would she so
          demean herself. Paul resolved to undertake her education. </p>
        <p>The months slipped by golden with fulfilment. News of the beautiful boy model
          went the round of the studios. Those were simpler times (although not so very
          long ago) in British art than the present, and the pretty picture was still in
          vogue. As Mr. Rowlatt, the young architect, had foretold, Paul had no difficulty
          in obtaining work. Indeed, it was fatally easy. Mr. Cyrus Rowlatt, R.A., had
          launched him. Being fabulously paid, he thought his new profession the most
          aristocratic calling in the world. In a remarkably short time he was able to
          repay Barney Bill. The day when he purchased the postal order was the proudest
          in his life. The transaction gave him a princely feeling. He alone of boys, by
          special virtue of his origin, was capable of such a thing. Again, his welcome in
          the painting world confirmed him in <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0090" n="75"/>
          the belief that he was a personage, born to great things. Posed on the model
          throne, the object of the painter's intense scrutiny, he swelled ingenuously
          with the conviction of his supreme importance. The lazy luxury of the model's
          life appealed to his sensuous temperament. He loved the warmth, the artistic
          setting of the studios; the pictures, the oriental rugs, the bits of armour, the
          old brocade, the rich cushions. If he had not been born to it, why had he not
          remained, like all 'the youth of Bludston, amid the filth and clatter of the
          factory? He loved, too, to hear the studio talk, though at first he comprehended
          little of it. The men and women for whom he sat possessed the same quality as
          his never-forgotten goddess and Lady Chudley and the young architect&mdash;a
          quality which he recognized keenly, but for which his limited vocabulary could
          find no definition. Afterward he realized that it was refinement in manner and
          speech and person. This quality he felt it essential to acquire. Accordingly he
          played the young ape to those who aroused his admiration. </p>
        <p>One day when Jane entered the back-parlour he sprang from his seat and advanced
          with outstretched hand to meet her: "My dear Lady Jane, how good of you to come!
          Do let me clear a chair for you." </p>
        <p>"What are you playing at?" asked Jane. </p>
        <p>"That's the way to receive a lady when she calls on you. </p>
        <p>"Oh!" said Jane. </p>
        <p>He practised on her each newly learned social accomplishment. He minced his
          broad Lancashire, when he spoke to her, in such a way as to be grotesquely
          unintelligible. By listening to conversations he learned many amazing social
          facts; among them that the gentry had a bath every morning of their lives. This
          stirred his imagination to such a pitch that he com- <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0091" n="76"/> manded Jane to bring up the matutinal
          washtub to his bedroom. By instinct refined he revelled in the resultant
          sensation of cleanliness. He paid great attention to his attire, modelling
          himself, as far as he could, on young Rowlatt, the architect, on whom he
          occasionally called to report progress. He bought such neckties and collars as
          Rowlatt wore and submitted them for Jane's approval. She thought them vastly
          genteel. He also entertained her with whatever jargon of art talk he managed to
          pick up. Thus, though the urchin gave himself airs and invested himself with
          affectations, which rendered him intolerable to all of his own social status,
          except the placid Mrs. Seddon and the adoring Jane, he was under the continuous
          influence of a high ambition. It made him ridiculous, but it preserved him from
          vicious and vulgar things. If you are conscious of being a prince in disguise
          qualifying for butterfly entrance into your kingdom, it behoves you to behave in
          a princely manner, not to consort with lewd fellows and not to neglect
          opportunities for education. You owe to yourself all the good that you can
          extract from the world. Acting from this point of view, and guided by the
          practical advice of young Rowlatt, he attended evening classes, where he gulped
          down knowledge hungrily. So, what with sitting and studying and backward and
          forward journeying, and educating Jane, and practising the accomplishments of a
          prince, and sleeping the long sound sleep of a tired youngster, Paul had no time
          to think of evil. He was far too much absorbed in himself. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, of Bludston not a sign. For all that he had heard of search being
          made for him, he might have been a runaway kitten. Sometimes he wondered what
          steps the Buttons had taken in order to find him. If they bad communicated with
          the police, <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0092" n="77"/> surely, at some stage of
          their journey, Barney Bill would have been held up and questioned. But had they
          even troubled to call in the police? Barney Bill thought not, and Paul agreed.
          The police were very unpopular in Budge Street&mdash;almost as unpopular as
          Paul. In all probability the Buttons were only too glad to be rid of him. If he
          found no favour in the eyes of Mrs. Button, in the eyes of Button he was
          detestable. Occasionally he spoke of them to Barney Bill on his rare appearances
          in London, but for prudential motives the latter had struck Bludston out of his
          itinerary and could give no information. At last Paul ceased altogether to think
          of them. They belonged to a far-distant past already becoming blurred in his
          memory. </p>
        <p>So Paul lived his queer sedulous life, month after month, year after year,
          known among the studios as a quaint oddity, drawn out indulgently by the men,
          somewhat petted, monkey-fashion, by the women, forgotten by both when out of
          their presence, but developing imperceptibly day by day along the self-centring
          line. A kindly adviser suggested a gymnasium to keep him in condition for
          professional purposes. He took the advice, and in the course of time became a
          splendid young animal, a being so physically perfect as to be what the good
          vicar of Bludston had called him in tired jest&mdash;a <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="la">lusus natur&oelig;</foreign>
          </hi>. But though proud of his body as any finely formed human may honorably be,
          a far higher arrogance saved him from Narcissus vanity. It was the inner and
          essential Paul and not the outer investiture that was born to great things. </p>
        <p>In his eighteenth year he gradually awoke to consciousness of change. One of
          his classmates at the Polytechnic institute, with whom be had picked a <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0093" n="78"/> slight acquaintance, said one evening as
          they were walking homeward together: "I shan't be coming here after next week.
          I've got a good clerkship in the city. What are you doing?" </p>
        <p>"I'm an artist's model," said Paul. </p>
        <p>The other, a pale and perky youth, sniffed. His name was Higgins. "Good Lord!
          What do you mean ?" </p>
        <p>"I'm a model in the life class of the Royal Academy School," said Paul,
          proudly. </p>
        <p>"You stand up naked in front of all kinds of people for them to paint you?" </p>
        <p>"Of course," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"How beastly!" said Higgins. </p>
        <p>"What do you mean?" </p>
        <p>"Just that," said Higgins. "It's beastly!" </p>
        <p>A minute or two afterward he jumped on a passing the omnibus, and thenceforward
          avoided Paul at the Polytechnic Institute. </p>
        <p>This uncompromising pronouncement on the part of Higgins was a shock; but
          together with other incidents, chiefly psychological, vague, intangible
          phenomena of his spiritual development, it showed Paul the possibility of
          another point of view. He took stock of himself. From the picturesque boy he had
          grown into the physically perfect man. As a model he was no longer sought after
          for subject pieces. He was in clamorous demand at Life Schools, where he drew a
          higher rate of pay, but where he was as impersonal to the intently working
          students as the cast of the Greek torso which other students were copying in the
          next room. The intimacy of the studio, the warmth and the colour and the
          meretricious luxury were gone from his life. On the other hand he was making
          money. He had fifty pounds in the Savings Bank, the maximum of petty thrift
          which an incom- <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0094" n="79"/> prehensive British
          Government encourages, and a fair, though unknown, sum in an iron money-box
          hidden behind his washstand. Up to now he had had no time to learn how to spend
          money. When he took to smoking cigarettes, which he had done quite recently, he
          regarded himself as a man. </p>
        <p>Higgins's "How beastly!" rang in his head. Although he could not quite
          understand the full meaning of the brutal judgment, it brought him disquiet and
          discontent. For one thing, like the high-road, his profession led nowhither. The
          thrill of adventure had gone from it. It was static, and Paul's temperament was
          dynamic. He had also lost his boyish sense of importance, of being the central
          figure in the little stage. Disillusion began to creep over him. Would he do
          nothing else but this all his life? Old Erricone, the patriarchal, white-bearded
          Italian, the doyen of the models of London, came before his mind, a senile
          posturer, mumbling dreary tales of his inglorious achievements: how he was the
          Roman Emperor in this picture and Father Abraham in the other; how painters
          could not get on without him; how once he had been summoned from Rome to London;
          how Rossetti had shaken hands with him. Paul shivered at the thought of himself
          as the Erricone of a future generation. </p>
        <p>The next day was Saturday, and he had no sitting. The morning he spent in his
          small bedroom in the soothing throes of literary composition. Some time ago he
          had thought it would be a mighty fine thing to be a poet, and had tried his hand
          at verse. Finding he possessed some facility, he decided that he was a poet, and
          at once started an epic poem in rhyme on the Life of Nelson, the material being
          supplied by Southey. This morning he did the Battle of the Baltic. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0095" n="80"/>
        </p>
        <p>He put the glass to his blind eye,<lb/> And said "No signals do I spy,"<lb/>
          wrote Paul. Poetry taken at the gallop like this was a very simple affair, and
          Paul covered an amazing amount of ground. </p>
        <p>In the afternoon he walked abroad with Jane, who, having lengthened her skirts
          and put up her hair, was now a young woman looking older than her years. She too
          had developed. Her lank figure had rounded into pretty curves. Her sharp little
          Cockney face had filled out. She had a pleasant smile and a capable brow, and,
          correcting a tendency to fluffiness of hair of which she disapproved, and
          dressing herself neatly, made herself by no means unattractive. Constant
          association with Paul had fired her ambitions. Like him, she might have a
          destiny, though not such a majestic one, Accordingly she had studied stenography
          and typewriting, with a view to earning her livelihood away from the little
          shop, which did not offer the prospect of a dazzling career. At the back of her
          girlish mind was the desire to keep pace with Paul in his upward flight, so that
          he should not be ashamed of her when he sat upon the clouds in glory. In awful
          secrecy she practised the social accomplishments which Paul brought home. She
          loved her Saturday and Sunday excursions with Paul&mdash;of late they had
          gone far afield: the Tower, Greenwich, Ricmond&mdash;exploring London and
          making splendid discoveries such as Westminster Abbey and a fourpenny tea garden
          at Putney. She scarcely knew whether she cared for these things for themselves;
          but she saw them through Paul coloured by his vivid personality. Once on Chelsea
          Bridge he had pointed out a peculiarly ugly stretch of low-tide mud, and said:
          "Look at that." She, by unprecedented chance, <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0096"
            n="81"/> mistaking his tone, had replied: "How lovely!" And she had thought it
          lovely, until his stare of rebuke and wonderment brought disillusion and
          spurting tears, which for the life of him he could not understand. It is very
          foolish, and often suicidal, of men to correct women for going into rapture.
          over mud flats. On that occasion, however, the only resultant harm was the
          conviction in the girl's heart that the presence of Paul turned mud flats into
          beds of asphodel. Then, just as she saw outer things through his eyes, she felt
          herself regarded by outer eyes through him. His rare and absurd beauty made him
          a cynosure whithersoever he went. London, vast and seething, could produce no
          such perfect Apollo. When she caught the admiring glances of others of her sex,
          little Jane drew herself up proudly and threw back insolent glances of triumph.
          "You would like to be where I am, wouldn't you?" the glance would say, with the
          words almost formulated in her mind. "But you won't. You never will be. I've got
          him. He's walking out with me and not with you. I like to see you squirm, you
          envious little cat." Jane was not a princess, she was merely a child of the
          people; but I am willing to eat my boots if it can be satisfactorily proved that
          there is a princess living on the face of the earth who would not be delighted
          at seeing another woman cast covetous eyes on the man she loved, and would not
          call her a cat (or its homonym) for doing so. </p>
        <p>On this mild March afternoon Paul and Jane walked in the Euston Road, he in a
          loose blue serge suit, floppy black tie, low collar and black soft felt hat
          (this was in the last century, please remember&mdash;epoch almost romantic,
          so fast does time fly), she in neat black braided jacket and sailor hat. They
          looked pathetically young. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0097" n="82"/>
        </p>
        <p>"Where shall we go?" asked Jane. </p>
        <p>Paul, in no mood for high adventure, suggested Regent's Park. "At least we can
          breathe there," said he. </p>
        <p>Jane sniffed up the fresh spring air, unconscious of the London taint, and
          laughed. "Why, what's the matter with the Euston Road?" </p>
        <p>"It's vulgar," said Paul. "In the Park the hyacinths and the daffodils will be
          out." </p>
        <p>What he meant he scarcely knew. When one is very young and out of tune with
          life, one is apt to speak discordantly. </p>
        <p>They mounted a westward omnibus. Paul lit a cigarette and smoked almost in
          silence until they alighted by the Park gates. As they entered, he turned to her
          suddenly. "Look here, Jane, I want to ask you something. The other night I told
          a man I was an artist's model, and he said 'How beastly!' and turned away as if
          I wasn't fit for him to associate with. What was he driving at?" </p>
        <p>"He was a nasty cad," said Jane promptly. </p>
        <p>"Of course he was," said Paul. "But why did he say it? Do you think there's
          anything beastly in being a model?" </p>
        <p>"Certainly not." She added in modification: "That is if you like it." </p>
        <p>"Well, supposing I don't like it?" </p>
        <p>She did not reply for a minute or two. Then: "If you really don't like it, I
          should be rather glad." </p>
        <p>"Why?" asked Paul. </p>
        <p>She raised a piteous face. </p>
        <p>"Yes, tell me," he insisted. "Tell me why you agree with that cad Higgins?" </p>
        <p>"I don't agree with him." </p>
        <p>"You must." <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0098" n="83"/>
        </p>
        <p>They fenced for a while. At last he pinned her down. </p>
        <p>"Well, if you want to know," she declared, with a flushed cheek, "I don't think
          it's a man's job." </p>
        <p>He bit his lip. He had asked for the truth and he had got it. His own dark
          suspicions were confirmed. Jane glanced at him fearful of offence. When they had
          walked some yards he spoke. "What would you call a man's job?" </p>
        <p>Jane hesitated for an answer. Her life had been passed in a sphere where men
          carpentered or drove horses or sold things in shops. Deeply impressed by the
          knowledge of Paul's romantic birth and high destiny she could not suggest any
          such lowly avocations, and she did not know what men's jobs were usually
          executed by scions of the nobility. A clerk's work was certainly genteel; but
          even that would be lowering to the hero. She glanced at him again, swiftly. No,
          he was too beautiful to be penned up in an office from nine to six-thirty every
          day of his life. On the other hand her feminine intuition appreciated keenly the
          withering criticism of Higgins. Ever since Paul had first told her of his
          engagements at the Life Schools she had shrunk from the idea. It was all very
          well for the boy; but for the man&mdash;and being younger than he, she
          regarded him now as a man&mdash; there was something in it that offended her
          nice sense of human dignity. </p>
        <p>"Well," he said. "Tell me, what do you call a man's job?" </p>
        <p>"Oh, I don't know," she said in distress; "something you do with your hands or
          your brain." </p>
        <p>"You think being a model is undignified." </p>
        <p>"Yes." </p>
        <p>"So do I," said Paul. "But I'm doing things with my brain, too, you know," he
          added quickly, anxious <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0099" n="84"/> to be seen
          again on his pedestal. "I am getting on with my epic poem. I've done a lot since
          you last heard it. I'll read you the rest when we get home." </p>
        <p>"That will be lovely," said Jane, to whom the faculty of rhyming was a
          never-ceasing wonder. She would sit bemused by the jingling lines and wrapt in
          awe at the minstrel. </p>
        <p>They sat on a bench by the flower-beds, gay in their spring charm of belated
          crocus and hyacinth and daffodil, with here and there a precocious tulip. Paul,
          sensitive to beauty, discoursed on flowers. Max Field had a studio in St. John's
          Wood opening out into a garden, which last summer was a dream of delight. He
          described it. When he came into his kingdom he intended to have such a garden. </p>
        <p>"You'll let me have a peep at it sometimes, won't you?" said Jane. </p>
        <p>"Of course," said Paul. </p>
        <p>The lack of enthusiasm in his tone chilled the girl's heart. But she did not
          protest. In these days, in spite of occasional outspokenness she was still a
          humble little girl worshipping her brilliant companion from afar. </p>
        <p>"How often could I come?" she asked. </p>
        <p>"That," said he, in his boyish pashadom, "would depend on how good you were." </p>
        <p>Obedient to the thought processes of her sex, she made a bee line to the
          particular. </p>
        <p>"Oh, Paul, I hope you're not angry." </p>
        <p>"At what?" </p>
        <p>"At what I said about your being a model." </p>
        <p>"Not a bit," said he. "If I hadn't wanted to know your opinion, I wouldn't have
          asked you." </p>
        <p>She brightened. "You really wanted to know what I thought?" <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0100" n="85"/>
        </p>
        <p>"Naturally," said Paul. "You're the most commonsense girl I've ever met." </p>
        <p>Paul walked soberly home. Jane accompanied him&mdash;on wings. </p>
        <p>On Monday Paul went to the Life School and stripped with a heavy heart. Jane
          was right. It was not a man's job. The fact, too, of his doing it lowered him in
          her esteem, and though he had no romantic thoughts whatever with regard to Jane,
          he enjoyed being Lord Paramount in her eyes. He went into the studio and took up
          his pose; and as he stood on the model throne, conspicuous, glaring, the one
          startling central object, Higgins's "How beastly!" came like a material echo and
          smote him in the face. He felt like Adam when he first proceeded to his
          primitive tailoring. A wave of shame ran through him. He looked around the great
          silent room, at the rows of students, each in front of an easel, using his naked
          body for their purposes. A phrase flashed across his mind&mdash;in three
          years his reading had brought vocabulary&mdash;they were using his physical
          body for their spiritual purposes. For the moment he hated them all fiercely.
          They were a band of vampires. Habit and discipline alone saved him from breaking
          his pose and fleeing headlong. But there he was fixed, like marble, in an
          athlete's attitude, showing rippling muscles of neck and chest and arms and
          thighs all developed by the gymnasium into the perfection of Greek beauty, and
          all useless, more useless even, as far as the world's work was concerned, than
          the muscles of a racehorse. There he was fixed, with outstretched limbs and
          strained loins, a human being far more alive than the peering, measuring throng,
          far more important, called by a destiny infinitely higher than theirs. And none
          of them suspected it. For <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0101" n="86"/> the first
          time he saw himself as they saw him. They admired him as a <hi rend="italic"
            >thing</hi>, an animal trained especially for them, a prize bullock. As a
          human being they disregarded him. Nay, in the depth of their hearts they
          despised him. Not one of them would have stood where he did. He would have
          considered it&mdash;rightly&mdash;as degrading to his manhood. </p>
        <p>The head of the school snapped his fingers impatiently and fussed up to the
          model-stand. "What's the matter? Tired already? Take it easy for a minute, if
          you like." </p>
        <p>"No," said Paul, instinctively stiffening himself. "I'm never tired." </p>
        <p>It was his boast that he could stand longer in a given pose than any other
          model, and thereby he had earned reputation. </p>
        <p>"Then don't go to pieces, my boy," said the head of the school, not unkindly.
          "You're supposed to be a Greek athlete and not Venus rising from the sea or a
          jelly at a children's party." </p>
        <p>Paul flushed all over, and insane anger shook him. How dared the mar. speak to
          him like that? He kept the pose, thinking wild thoughts. Every moment the strain
          grew less bearable, the consciousness of his degradation more intense. He longed
          for something to happen, something dramatic, something that would show the
          vampires what manner of man he was. He was histrionic in his anguish. </p>
        <p>A fly settled on his back&mdash;a damp, sluggish fly that had survived the
          winter&mdash;and it crawled horribly up his spine. He bore it for a few
          moments, and then his over-excited nerves gave way and he dashed his hand behind
          him. Somebody laughed. He raised his clenched fists and glared at the class. </p>
        <p>"Ay, yo' can laugh&mdash;you can laugh till yo' bust!" he cried, falling
          back into his Lancashire accent. "But <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0102" n="87"/>
          yo'll never see me, here agen. Never, never, never, so help me God!" </p>
        <p>He rushed away. The head of the school followed him and, while he was dressing,
          reasoned with him. </p>
        <p>"Nay," said Paul. "Never agen. Aw'm doan wi' th' whole business." </p>
        <p>And as Paul walked home through the hurrying streets, he thought regretfully of
          twenty speeches which would have more adequately signified his indignant
          retirement from the profession.</p>

        <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0103" n="88"/>
        <head>CHAPTER VI</head>

        <p>PAUL'S model-self being dead, he regarded it with complacency and set his foot
          on it, little doubting that it was another stepping-stone. </p>
        <p>He spoke loftily of his independence. </p>
        <p>"But how are you going to earn your living?" asked Jane, the practical. </p>
        <p>"I shall follow one of the arts," Paul replied. "I think I am a poet, but I
          might be a painter or a musician." </p>
        <p>"You do sing and play lovely," said Jane. </p>
        <p>He had recently purchased from a pawnshop a second-hand mandoline, which he had
          mastered by the aid of a sixpenny handbook, and he would play on it
          accompaniments to sentimental ballads which he sang in a high baritone. </p>
        <p>"I'll not choose yet awhile," said Paul, disregarding the tribute. "Something
          will happen. The 'moving finger' will point&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"What moving finger?" </p>
        <p>"The finger of Destiny," said Paul. </p>
        <p>And, as the superb youth predicted, something did happen a day or two
          afterwards. </p>
        <p>They were walking in Regent Street, and stopped, as was their wont, before a
          photographer's window where portraits of celebrities were exposed to view. Paul
          loved this window, bad loved it from the moment of discovery, a couple of years
          before. It was a Temple of Fame. The fact of your portrait being exhibited, with
          your style and title printed below, <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0104" n="89"/>
          marked you as one of the great ones of the earth. Often he had said to Jane:
          "When I am there you'll be proud, won't you?" </p>
        <p>And she had looked up to him adoringly and wondered why he was not there
          already. </p>
        <p>It was Paul's habit to scrutinize the faces of those who had achieved
          greatness, Archbishops, Field-Marshals, Cabinet Ministers, and to speculate on
          the quality of mind that had raised them to their high estate; and often he
          would shift his position, so as to obtain a glimpse of his own features in the
          plate-glass window, and compare them with those of the famous. Thus he would
          determine that he had the brow of the divine, the nose of the statesman and the
          firm lips of the soldier. It was a stimulating pastime. He was born to great
          things; but to what great things he knew not. The sphere in which his glory
          should be fulfilled was as yet hidden in the mists of time. </p>
        <p>But this morning, instead of roving over the illustrious gallery, his eye
          caught and was fascinated by a single portrait. He stood staring at it for a
          long time, lost in the thrill of thought. </p>
        <p>At last Jane touched his arm. "What are you looking at?" </p>
        <p>He pointed. "Do you see that?" </p>
        <p>"Yes. It's&mdash;" She named an eminent actor, then in the heyday of his
          fame, of whom legend hath it that his photographs were bought in thousands by
          love-lorn maidens who slept with them beneath their pillows. </p>
        <p>Paul drew her away from the little knot of idlers clustered round the window.
          "There's nothing that man can do that I can't do," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"You're twenty times better looking," said Jane. </p>
        <p>"I have more intelligence," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Of course," said Jane. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0105" n="90"/>
        </p>
        <p>"I'm going to be an actor," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Oh!" cried Jane in sudden rapture. Then her sturdy common-sense asserted
          itself. "But can you act ?" </p>
        <p>"I'm sure I could, if I tried. You've only got to have the genius to start with
          and the rest is easy." </p>
        <p>As she did not dare question his genius, she remained silent. </p>
        <p>"I'm going to be an actor," said he, "and when I'm not acting I shall be a
          poet." </p>
        <p>In spite of her adoration Jane could not forbear a shaft of raillery. "You'll
          leave yourself some time to be a musician, won't you?" </p>
        <p>He laughed. His alert and retentive mind had seized, long ago, on Rowlatt's
          recommendation at the Little Bear Inn, and he had developed, perhaps half
          consciously, a half sense of humour. A whole sense, however, is not congruous
          with the fervid beliefs and soaring ambitions of eighteen. Your sense of humour,
          that delicate percipience of proportion, that subrident check on impulse, that
          touch of the divine fellowship with human frailty, is a thing of mellower
          growth. It is a solvent and not an excitant. It does not stimulate to sublime
          effort; but it can cool raging passion. It can take the salt from tears, the
          bitterness from judgment, the keenness from despair; but in its universal
          manifestation it would effectually stop a naval engagement. </p>
        <p>Paul laughed. "You mustn't think I brag too much, Jane," said he. "For anybody
          else I know what I say would be ridiculous. But for me it's different. I'm going
          to be a great man. I know it. If I'm not going to be a great actor, I shall be a
          great something else. God doesn't put such things into people's heads for
          nothing. He didn't take me from the factory in Bludston and set me here with
          you, walking up Regent <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0106" n="91"/> Street, like a
          gentleman, just to throw me back into the gutter." </p>
        <p>"But who said you were going back to the gutter?" asked Jane. </p>
        <p>"Nobody. I wanted to get right with myself. But&mdash;that getting right
          with oneself&mdash;do you think it egotistic ?" </p>
        <p>"I don't quite know what that is." </p>
        <p>He defined the term. </p>
        <p>"No," she said seriously. "I don't think it is. Everybody has got a self to
          consider. I don't look on it as ego-what-d'-you-call-it to strike out for myself
          instead of going on helping mother to mind the shop. So why should you?" </p>
        <p>"Besides, I owe a duty to my parents, don't I?" he asked eagerly. </p>
        <p>But here Jane took her own line. "I can't see that you do, considering that
          they've done nothing for you." </p>
        <p>"They've done everything for me," he protested vehemently. "They've made me
          what I am." </p>
        <p>"They didn't take much trouble about it," said Jane. </p>
        <p>They squabbled for a while after the manner of boy and girl. At last she cried:
          "Don't you see I'm proud of you for yourself and not for your silly old parents?
          What have they got to do with me? And besides, you'll never find them." </p>
        <p>"I don't think you know what you're talking about," he said loftily. "It is
          time we were getting home." </p>
        <p>He walked on for some time stiffly, his head in the air, not condescending to
          speak. She had uttered blasphemy. He would find his parents, he vowed to
          himself, if only to spite Jane. Presently his ear caught a little sniff, and
          looking down, saw her dabbing her eyes with her handkerchief. His heart softened
          at once. "Never mind," said he. "You didn't mean it." <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0107" n="92"/>
        </p>
        <p>"It's only because I love you, Paul," she murmured wretchedly. </p>
        <p>"That's all right," he said. "Let us go in here"&mdash;they were passing a
          confectioner's&mdash;"and we'll have some jam-puffs." </p>
        <p>Paul went to his friend Rowlatt, who had already heard, through one of his
          assistants who had a friend in the Life School, of the dramatic end of the
          model's career. </p>
        <p>"I quite sympathize with you," Rowlatt laughed. "I've wondered how you stuck it
          so long. What are you going to do now?" </p>
        <p>"I'm going on the stage." </p>
        <p>"How are you going to get there?" </p>
        <p>"I don't know," said Paul, "but if I knew an actor, he would be able to tell
          me. I thought perhaps you might know an actor." </p>
        <p>"I do&mdash;one or two," replied Rowlatt; "but they're just ordinary
          actors&mdash;not managers; and I shouldn't think they'd be able to do
          anything for you." </p>
        <p>,,Except what I say," Paul persisted. "They'll tell me how one sets about being
          an actor." </p>
        <p>Rowlatt scribbled a couple of introductions on visiting cards, and Paul went
          away satisfied. He called on the two actors. The first, in atrabiliar mood,
          advised him to sweep crossings, black shoes, break stones by the roadside, cart
          manure, sell tripe or stocks and shares, blow out his brains rather than enter a
          profession over whose portals was inscribed the legend, <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="la">Lasciate ogni speranza</foreign>
          </hi>&mdash;he snapped his finger and thumb to summon memory as if it were a
          dog. </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="it">Voi che intrate</foreign></hi>,"
          continued Paul, delighted at showing off the one Italian tag he had picked up
          from his reading. And filled with one of the purest joys of <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0108" n="93"/> the young literary life and therefore
          untouched by pessimistic counsel, he left the despairing actor. </p>
        <p>The second, a brighter and more successful man, talked with Paul for a long
          time about all manner of things. Having no notion of his antecedents, he assumed
          him to be a friend of Rowlatt and met him on terms of social equality. Paul
          expanded like a flower to the sun. It was the first time he had spoken with an
          educated man on common ground&mdash;a man to whom the great imaginative
          English writers were familiar friends, who ran from Chaucer to Lamb and from
          Dryden to Browning with amazing facility. The strong wine of allusive talk
          mounted to Paul's brain. Tingling with excitement, he brought out all his small
          artillery of scholarship and acquitted himself so well that his host sent him
          off with a cordial letter to a manager of his acquaintance. </p>
        <p>The letter opened the difficult door of the theatre. His absurd beauty of face
          and figure, a far greater recommendation in the eyes of the manager who had
          begun rehearsals for an elaborate romantic production than a knowledge of <hi
            rend="italic">The Fa&euml;rie Queene</hi>, obtained for him an immediate
          engagement&mdash;to walk on as a gilded youth of Italy in two or three
          scenes at a salary of thirty shillings a week. Paul went home and spread himself
          like a young peacock before Jane, and said: "I am an actor." </p>
        <p>The girl's eyes glowed. "You are wonderful." </p>
        <p>"No, not I," replied Paul modestly. "It is my star." </p>
        <p>"Have you got a big part?" asked Jane. </p>
        <p>He laughed pityingly, sweeping back his black curls. "No, you silly, I haven't
          any lines to speak"&mdash;he had at once caught up the phrase&mdash;"I
          must begin at the beginning. Every actor has to do it." </p>
        <p>"You'll get mother and me orders to come and see you, won't you?" <pb

        </p>
        <p>"You shall have a box," declared Paul the magnificent. </p>
        <p>Thus began a new phase in the career of Paul Kegworthy. After the first few
          days of bewilderment on the bare, bleak stage, where oddments of dilapidated
          furniture served to indicate thrones and staircases and palace doors and mossy
          banks; where men and women in ordinary costume behaved towards one another in
          the most ridiculous way and went through unintelligible actions with phantom
          properties; where the actor-manager would pause in the breath of an impassioned
          utterance and cry out, "Oh, my God! stop that hammering!" where nothing looked
          the least bit in the world like the lovely ordered picture he had been
          accustomed to delight in from the shilling gallery&mdash;after the first few
          days he began to focus this strange world and to suffer its fascination. And he
          was proud of the silent part allotted to him, a lazy lute-player in attendance
          on the great lady, who lounged about on terrace steps in picturesque attitudes.
          He was glad that he was not an unimportant member of the crowd of courtiers who
          came on in a bunch and bowed and nodded and pretended to talk to one another and
          went off again. He realized that he would be in sight of the audience all the
          time. It did not strike him that the manager was using him merely as a piece of
          decoration. </p>
        <p>One day, however, at rehearsal the leading lady said: "If my lute-player could
          play a few chords here&mdash;or the orchestra for him-it would help me
          tremendously. I've got all this long cross with nothing to say." </p>
        <p>Paul seized his opportunity. "I can play the mandoline," said he. </p>
        <p>"Oh, can you?" said the manager, and Paul was <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0110"
            n="95"/> handed over to the musical director, and the next day rehearsed with
          a real instrument which he twanged in the manner prescribed. He did not fail to
          announce himself to Jane as a musician. </p>
        <p>Gradually he found his feet among the heterogeneous band who walk on at London
          theatres. Some were frankly vulgar, some were pretentiously genteel, a good many
          were young men of gentle birth from the public schools and universities. Paul's
          infallible instinct drew him into timid companionship with the last. He knew
          little of the things they talked about, golf and cricket prospects, and the then
          brain-baffling Ibsen, but he listened modestly, hoping to learn. He reaped the
          advantage of having played "the sedulous ape" to his patrons of the studios. His
          tricks were somewhat exaggerated; his sweep of the hat when ladies passed him at
          the stage door entrance was lower than custom deems necessary; he was quicker in
          courteous gesture than the young men from the universities; he bowed more
          deferentially to an interlocutor than is customary outside Court circles; but
          they were all the tricks of good breeding. More than one girl asked if he were
          of foreign extraction. He remembered Rowlatt's question of years ago, and, as
          then, he felt curiously pleased. He confessed to an exotic strain: to Italian
          origin. Italy was romantic. When he obtained a line part and he appeared on the
          bill, he took the opportunity of changing a name linked with unpleasant
          associations which he did not regard as his own. Kegworthy was cast into the
          limbo of common things, and he became Paul Savelli. But this was later. </p>
        <p>He made friends at the theatre. Some of the women, by petting and flattery, did
          their best to spoil him; but Paul was too ambitious, too much absorbed in his
          dream of greatness and his dilettante literary <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0111"
            n="96"/> and musical pursuits, too much yet of a boy to he greatly affected.
          What he prized far more highly than feminine blandishments was the new
          comradeship with his own sex. Instinctively he sought them, as a sick dog seeks
          grass, unconsciously feeling the need of them in his mental and moral
          development. Besides, the attitude of the women reminded him of that of the
          women painters in his younger days. He had no intention of playing the pet
          monkey again. His masculinity revolted. The young barbarian clamoured. A hard
          day on the river he found much more to his taste than sporting in the shade of a
          Kensington flat over tea and sandwiches with no matter how sentimental an
          Amaryllis. Jane, who had seen the performance, though not from a box, a couple
          of upper-circle seats being all that Paul could obtain from the acting-manager,
          and had been vastly impressed by Paul's dominating position in the stage
          fairy-world, said to him, with a sniff that choked a sigh: "Now that you've got
          all those pretty girls around you, I suppose you soon won't think of me any
          longer?" </p>
        <p>Paul waved the dreaded houris away as though they were midges. "I'm sick of
          girls," he replied in a tone of such sincerity that Jane tossed her head. </p>
        <p>"Oh? Then I suppose you lump me with the rest and are sick of me too?" </p>
        <p>"Don't worry a fellow," said Paul. "You're not a girl-not in that sense, I
          mean. You're a pal." </p>
        <p>"Anyway, they're lots prettier than what I am," she said defiantly. </p>
        <p>He looked at her critically, after the brutal manner of obtuse boyhood, and
          beheld an object quite agreeable to the sight. Her Londoner's ordinarily
          colourless checks were flushed, her blue eyes shone bright, her little chin was
          in the air and her parted lips showed a flash of white teeth. She wore a neat
          simple blouse <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0112" n="97"/> and skirt and held her
          slim, half-developed figure taut. Paul shook his head. "Jolly few of
          them&mdash;without grease-paint on." </p>
        <p>"But you see them all painted up." </p>
        <p>He burst into laughter. "Then they're beastly, near by! You silly kid, don't
          you know? We've got to make up, otherwise no one in front would be able to see
          our mouths and noses and eyes. From the front we look lovely; but close to we're
          horrors." </p>
        <p>"Well, how should I know that?" asked Jane. </p>
        <p>"You couldn't unless you saw us&mdash;or were told. But now you know." </p>
        <p>"Do you look beastly too?" </p>
        <p>"Vile," he laughed. </p>
        <p>"I'm glad I didn't think of going on the stage,"' she said, childish yet very
          feminine unreason combining with atavistic puritanism. "I shouldn't like to
          paint my face." </p>
        <p>"You get used to it," said Paul, the experienced. </p>
        <p>"I think it horrid to paint your face." </p>
        <p>He swung to the door&mdash;they were in the little parlour behind the
          shop&mdash;a flash of anger in his eyes. "If you think everything I do
          horrid, I can't talk to you." </p>
        <p>He marched out. Jane suddenly realized that she had behaved badly. She whipped
          herself. She had behaved atrociously. Of course she had been jealous of the
          theatre girls; but had he not been proving to her all the time in what small
          account he held them? And now he had gone. At seventeen a beloved gone for an
          hour is a beloved gone for ever. She rushed to the foot of the stairs on which
          his ascending steps still creaked. </p>
        <p>"Paul!" </p>
        <p>"Yes." </p>
        <p>"Come back! Do come back!" </p>
        <p>Paul came back and followed her into the parlour. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0113" n="98"/>
        </p>
        <p>"I'm sorry," she said. </p>
        <p>He graciously forgave her, having already arrived at the mature conclusion that
          females were unaccountable folk whose excursions into unreason should be
          regarded by man with pitying indulgence. And, in spite of the seriousness with
          which he took himself, he was a sunny-tempered youth. </p>
        <p>Barney Bill, putting into the Port of London, so to speak, in order to take in
          cargo, also visited the theatre towards the end of the run of the piece. He
          waited, by arrangement, for Paul outside the stage door, and Paul, coming out,
          linked arms and took him to a blazing bar in Piccadilly Circus and ministered to
          his thirst, with a princely air. </p>
        <p>"It seems rum," said Bill, wiping his lips with the back of his hand, after a
          mighty pull at the pint tankard&mdash;"it seems rum that you should be
          standing me drinks at a swell place like this. It seems only yesterday that you
          was a two-penn'orth of nothing jogging along o' me in the old 'bus." </p>
        <p>"I've moved a bit since then, haven't I?" said Paul. </p>
        <p>"You have, sonny," said Barney Bill. "But"-he sighed and looked around the
          noisy glittering place, at the smart barmaids, the well-clad throng of loungers,
          some in evening dress, the half-dozen gorgeous ladies sitting with men at little
          tables by the window&mdash;"I thinks as how you gets more real happiness in
          a quiet village pub, and the beer is cheaper, and&mdash;gorblimey !" </p>
        <p>He ran his finger between his stringy neck and the frayed stand-up collar that
          would have sawn his head off but for the toughness of his hide. To do Paul
          honour he had arrayed himself in his best&mdash;a wondrously cut and
          heavily-braided morning coat and lavender-coloured trousers of eccentric shape,
          and a funny little billycock hat too small for him, and a thunder-and-lightning
          necktie, all of which he had <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0114" n="99"/> purchased
          nearly twenty years ago to grace a certain, wedding a. which he had been best
          man. Since then he had worn the Nessus shirt of a costume not more than
          half-a-dozen times. The twisted, bright-eyed little man, so obviously ill at
          ease in his amazing garb, and the beautiful youth, debonair in his well-fitting
          blue serge, formed a queer contrast. </p>
        <p>"Don't you never long for the wind of God and the smell of the rain?" asked
          Barney Bill. </p>
        <p>"I haven't the time," said Paul. "I'm busy all day long." </p>
        <p>"Well, well," said Barney Bill, "the fellow wasn't far wrong who said it takes
          all sorts to make a world. There are some as likes electric light and some as
          likes the stars. Gimme the stars." And in his countryman's way he set the beer
          in his tankard swirling round and round before he put it again to his lips. </p>
        <p>Paul sipped his beer reflectively. "You may find happiness and peace of soul
          under the stars," said he, sagely, "and if I were a free agent I'd join you
          tomorrow. But you can't find fame. You can't rise to great things. I want
          to&mdash;well, I don't quite know what I want to do," he laughed, "but it's
          something big." </p>
        <p>"Yuss, my boy," said Barney Bill. "I understand. You was always like that. You
          haven't come any nearer finding your 'igh-born parents ?"&mdash;there was a
          twinkle in his eyes&mdash;" 'ave yer?" </p>
        <p>"I'm not going to bother any more about them, whoever they are," said Paul,
          lighting a cigarette. "When I was a kid I used to dream that they would find me
          and do everything for me. Now I'm a man with experience of life, I find that
          I've got to do everything for myself. And by George!"&mdash;he thumped the
          bar and smiled the radiant smile of the young Apollo&mdash;"I'm going to do
          it." <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0115" n="100"/>
        </p>
        <p>Barney Bill took off his Luke's iron crown of a billycock hat and scratched his
          cropped and grizzled head. "How old are you, sonny?" </p>
        <p>"Nearly nineteen," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"By Gosh!" said Barney Bill. </p>
        <p>He put on his hat at a comfortable but rakish angle. He looked like a
          music-hall humourist. A couple of the gorgeous ladies giggled. </p>
        <p>"Yuss," said he, "you're a man with an experience of life&mdash;and nobody
          can do nothing for you but yerself. Poor old Barney Bill has been past helping
          you this many a year." </p>
        <p>"But I owe everything to you!" cried Paul, boyishly. "If it hadn't been for
          you, I should still be working in that factory at Bludston." </p>
        <p>Bill winked and nodded acquiescence as he finished his tankard. </p>
        <p>"I've often wondered&mdash;since I've grown up&mdash;what induced you
          to take me away. What was it?" </p>
        <p>Bill cocked his head on one side and regarded him queerly. "Now you're
          arsking," said he. </p>
        <p>Paul persisted. "You must have had some reason." </p>
        <p>"I suppose I was interested in them parents of yours," said Barney Bill. </p>
        <p>And that was all he would say on the subject. </p>
        <p>The days went on. The piece had run through the summer and autumn, and Paul, a
          favourite with the management, was engaged for the next production. At rehearsal
          one day the author put in a couple of lines, of which he was given one to speak.
          He now was in very truth an actor. Jane could no longer taunt him in her naughty
          moods (invariably followed by bitter repentance) with playing a dumb part like a
          trained dog. He had a real part, typewritten and done up in a brown-paper cover,
          which was handed to him, with lack of humour, by the assistant stage manager.
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0116" n="101"/>
        </p>
        <p>In view of his own instantaneous success he tried to persuade Jane to go on the
          stage; but Jane had no artistic ambitions, to say nothing of her disinclination
          to paint her face. She preferred the prosaic reality of stenography and
          typewriting. No sphere could be too dazzling for Paul; he was born to great
          things, the consciousness of his high destiny being at once her glory and her
          despair; but, as regards herself, her outlook on life was cool and sober. Paul
          was peacock born; it was for him to strut about in iridescent plumage. She was a
          humble daw and knew her station. It must be said that Paul held out the stage as
          a career more on account of the social status that it would give to Jane than
          through a belief in her histrionic possibilities. He too, fond as he was of the
          girl with whom he had grown up, recognized the essential difference between
          them. She was as pretty, as sensible, as helpful a little daw as ever chattered;
          but the young peacock never for an instant forgot her daw-dom. </p>
        <p>Jane's profound common-sense reaped its reward the following spring when she
          found herself obliged to earn her livelihood. 'Her mother died, and the shop was
          sold, and an aunt in Cricklewood offered Jane a home, on condition that she paid
          for her keep. This she was soon able to do when she obtained a situation with a
          business firm in the city. The work was hard and the salary small; but Jane had
          a brave heart and held her head high. In her simple philosophy life was work,
          and dreaming an occasional luxury. Her mother's death grieved her deeply, for
          she was a girl of strong affections, and the breaking up of her life with Paul
          seemed an irremediable catastrophe. </p>
        <p>"It's just as well," said her aunt, "that there's an end of it, or you'd be
          making a fool of yourself over <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0117" n="102"/> that
          young actor chap with his pretty face. I don't hold with any of them." </p>
        <p>But Jane was too proud to reply. </p>
        <p>On their last night together in the Barn Street house they sat alone in the
          little back-parlour as they had done for the last six years&mdash;all their
          impressionable childish days. It was the only home that Paul had known, and he
          felt the tragedy of its dissolution. They sat on the old horsehair sofa, behind
          the table, very tearful, very close together in spirit, holding each other's
          hands. They talked as the young talk--and the old, for the matter of that. She
          trembled at his wants unministered to in his new lodgings. He waved away
          prospective discomfort: what did it matter? He was a man and could rough it. It
          was she herself whose loss would be irreparable. She sighed; he would soon
          forget her. He vowed undying remembrance by all his gods. Some beautiful
          creature of the theatre would carry him off. He laughed at such an absurdity.
          Jane would always be his confidante, his intimate. Even though they lived under
          different roofs, they would meet and have their long happy jaunts together. Jane
          said dolefully that it could only be on Sundays, as their respective working
          hours would never correspond&mdash;"And you haven't given me your Sundays
          for a year," she added. Paul slid from the dark theme and, to comfort her, spoke
          glowingly of the future, when he should have achieved his greatness. He would
          give her a beautiful house with carriages and servants, and she would not have
          to work. </p>
        <p>"But if you are not there, what's the good of anything?" she said. </p>
        <p>"I'll come to see you, silly dear," he replied ingenuously. </p>
        <p>Before they parted for the night she threw her arms <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0118" n="103"/> round his neck impulsively. "Don't
          quite forget me, Paul. It would break my heart. I've only you left now poor
          mother's gone." </p>
        <p>Paul kissed her and vowed again. He did not vow that he would be a mother to
          her, though to the girl's heart it seemed as if he did. The little girl was
          aching for a note in his voice that never came. Now, ninety-nine youths in a
          hundred who held, at such a sentimental moment, a comely and not uncared-for
          maiden in their arms, would have lost their heads (and their hearts) and vowed
          in the desired manner. But Paul was different, and Jane knew it, to her sorrow.
          He was by no means temperamentally cold; far from it. But, you see, he lived
          intensely in his dream, and only on its outer fringe had Jane her place. In the
          heart of it, hidden in amethystine mist, from which only flashed the diadem on
          her hair, dwelt the exquisite, the incomparable lady, the princess who should
          share his kingdom, while he knelt at her feet and worshipped her and kissed the
          rosy tips of her calm fingers. So, as it never entered his head to kiss the
          finger tips of poor Jane, it never entered his head to fancy himself in love
          with her. Therefore, when she threw herself into his arms, he hugged her in a
          very sincere and brotherly way, but kissed her with a pair of cast lips of
          Adonis. Of course he would never forget her. Jane went to bed and sobbed her
          heart out. Paul slept but little. The breaking up of the home meant the end of
          many precious and gentle things, and without them he knew that his life would be
          the poorer. And he vowed once more, to himself, that he would never prove
          disloyal to Jane. </p>
        <p>While he remained in London he saw what he could of her, sacrificing many a
          Sunday's outing with the theatre folk. Jane, instinctively aware of this, and
          finding in his demeanour, after examining it with femi- <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0119" n="104"/> ninely jealous, microscopic eyes,
          nothing perfunctory, was duly grateful. and gave him of her girlish best. She
          developed very quickly after her entrance into the worid of struggle. Very soon
          it was the woman and not the child who listened to the marvellous youth's story
          of the wonders that would be. She never again threw herself into his arms, and
          he never again called her a "little silly." She was dimly aware of change,
          though she knew that the world could hold no other man for her. But Paul was
          not. </p>
        <p>And then Paul went on tour.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER VII</head>

        <p>PAUL had been four years on the stage. Save as a memory they had as little
          influence on the colour of his after-life as his years at Bludston or his years
          in the studios. He was the man born to be king. The attainment of his kingdom
          alone mattered. The intermediary phases were of no account. It had been a period
          of struggle, hardship and, as far as the stage itself was concerned,
          disillusion. After the first year or so, the goddess Fortune, more fickle in
          Theatreland, perhaps, than anywhere else, passed him by. London had no use for
          his services, especially when it learned that he aspired to play parts. It even
          refused him the privilege of walking on and understudying. He drifted into the
          provinces, where, when he obtained an engagement, he found more scope for his
          ambitions. Often he was out, and purchased with his savings the bread of
          idleness. He knew the desolation of the agent's dingy stairs; he knew the
          heartache of the agent's dingy outer office. </p>
        <p>He was familiar, too, with bleak rehearsals, hours of listless waiting for his
          little scenes; with his powerlessness to get into his simple words the
          particular intonation required by an overdriven producer. Familiar, too, with
          long and hungry Sunday railway journeys when pious refreshment rooms are shut;
          with little mean towns like Bludston, where he and three or four of the company
          shared the same mean theatrical lodgings; with the dirty, insanitary theatres;
          with the ceaseless petty jealousies and bickerings of <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0121" n="106"/> the ill-paid itinerant troupe. The
          discomforts affected Paul but little., he had never had experience of luxuries,
          and the life itself was silken ease compared with what it would have been but
          for Barney Bill's kidnapping. It never occurred to him to complain of nubbly bed
          and ill-cooked steak and crowded and unventilated dressing rooms; but it always
          struck him as being absurd that such should continue to be the lot of one
          predestined to greatness. There was some flaw in the working of destiny. It
          puzzled him. </p>
        <p>Once indeed, being out, but having an engagement ahead, and waiting for
          rehearsals to begin, he had found himself sufficiently prosperous to take a
          third-class ticket to Paris, where he spent a glorious month. But the prosperity
          never returned, and he had to live on his memories of Paris. </p>
        <p>During these years books were, as ever, his joy and his consolation. He taught
          himself French and a little German. He read history, philosophy, a smattering of
          science, and interested himself in politics. So aristocratic a personage
          naturally had passionate Tory sympathies. Now and again&mdash;but not often,
          for the theatrical profession is generally Conservative&mdash;he came across
          a furious Radical in the company and tasted the joy of fierce argument. Now and
          again too, he came across a young woman of high modern cultivation, and once or
          twice narrowly escaped wrecking his heart on the Scylline rock of her intellect.
          It was only when he discovered that she had lost her head over his romantic
          looks, and not over his genius and his inherited right to leadership, that he
          began to question her intellectual sincerity. And there is nothing to send love
          scuttling away with his quiver between his legs like a note of interrogation of
          that sort. The only touch of the morbid in Paul was his resentment at owing
          anything to his mere personal <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0122" n="107"/>
          appearance. He could not escape the easy chaff of his fellows on his "fatal
          beauty." He dreaded the horrible and hackneyed phrase which every fresh intimacy
          either with man or woman would inevitably evoke, and he hated it beyond reason.
          There was a tour during which he longed for small-pox or a broken nose or facial
          paralysis, so that no woman should ever look at him again and no man accuse him
          in vulgar jest. </p>
        <p>He played small utility parts and understudied the leading man. On the rare
          occasions when he played the lead, he made no great hit. The company did not,
          after the generous way of theatre folks, surround him, when the performance was
          over, with a chorus of congratulation. The manager would say, "Quite all' right,
          my boy, as far as it goes, but still wooden. You must get more life into it."
          And Paul, who knew himself to be a better man in every way than the actor whose
          part he was playing, just as in his childhood days he knew himself to be a
          better man than Billy Goodge, could not understand the general lack of
          appreciation. Then he remembered the early struggles of the great actors: Edmund
          Kean, who on the eve of his first appearance at Drury Lane cried, "If I succeed
          I shall go mad!"; of Henry Irving (then at his zenith) and the five hundred
          parts he had played before he came to London; he recalled also the failure of
          Disraeli's first speech in the House of Commons and his triumphant prophecy. He
          had dreams of that manager on his bended knees, imploring him, with prayerful
          hands and streaming eyes, to play Hamlet at a salary of a thousand a week and of
          himself haughtily snapping his fingers at the paltry fellow. </p>
        <p>Well, which one of us who has ever dreamed at all has not had such dreams at
          twenty? Let him cast at Paul the first stone. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0123"
            n="108"/>
        </p>
        <p>And then, you must remember, Paul's faith in his vague but glorious destiny was
          the dynamic force of his young life. Its essential mystery kept him alert and
          buoyant. His keen, self-centred mind realized that his search on the stage for
          the true expression of his genius was only empirical. If he failed there, it was
          for him to try a hundred other spheres until he found the right one. But just as
          in his childish days he could not understand why he was not supreme in
          everything, so now he could not appreciate the charge of wooden inferiority
          brought against him by theatrical managers. </p>
        <p>He had been on the stage about three years when for the first time in his
          emancipated life something like a calamity befell him. He lost Jane. Like most
          calamities it happened in a foolishly accidental manner. He received a letter
          from Jane during the last three weeks of a tour&mdash;they always kept up an
          affectionate but desultory correspondence&mdash;giving a new address. The
          lease of her aunt's house having fallen in, they were moving to the south side
          of London. When he desired to answer the letter, he found he had lost it and
          could not remember the suburb, much less the street and number, whither Jane had
          migrated. A letter posted to the old address was returned through the post. The
          tour over, and he being again in London, he went on an errand of inquiry to
          Cricklewood, found the house empty and the neighbours and tradespeople ignorant.
          The poorer classes of London in their migrations seldom leave a trail behind
          them. Their correspondence being rare, it is not within their habits of life to
          fill up post-office forms with a view to the forwarding of letters. He could not
          write to Jane because he did not in the least know where she was. </p>
        <p>He reflected with dismay that Jane could, for the <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0124" n="109"/> same reason, no longer write to him.
          Ironic chance had so arranged that the landlady with whom he usually lodged in
          town, and whose house he used as a permanent address, had given up letting
          lodgings at the beginning of the tour, and had drifted into the limbo of London.
          Jane's only guide to his whereabouts had been the tour card which he had sent
          her as usual, giving dates and theatres. And the tour was over. On the chance
          that Jane, not hearing from him, should address a letter to the last theatre on
          the list, he communicated at once with the local management. But as local
          managements of provincial theatres shape their existences so as to avoid
          responsibilities of any kind save the maintenance of their bars and the
          deduction of their percentages from the box-office receipts, Paul knew that it
          was ludicrous to expect it to interest itself in the correspondence of an
          obscure member of a fourth-rate company which had once played to tenth-rate
          business within its mildewed walls. Being young, he wrote also to the human
          envelope containing the essence of stale beer, tobacco and lethargy that was the
          stage doorkeeper. But he might just as well have written to the station master
          or the municipal gasworks. As a matter of fact Jane and he were as much lost to
          one another as if the whole of England had been prim&aelig;val forest. </p>
        <p>It was a calamity which he regarded with dismay. He had many friends of the
          easy theatrical sort, who knew him as Paul Savelli, a romantically visaged,
          bright-natured, charming, intellectual, and execrably bad young actor. But there
          was only one Jane who knew him as little Paul Kegworthy. No woman he had ever
          met&mdash;and in the theatrical world one is thrown willy-nilly into close
          contact with the whole gamut of the sex&mdash;gave him just the same close,
          inti- <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0125" n="110"/> mate, comforting companionship.
          From Jane he hid nothing. Before all the others he was conscious of pose. Jane,
          with her cockney common-sense, her shrewdness, her outspoken criticism of
          follies, her unfailing sympathy in essentials, was welded into the very
          structure of his being. Only when he had lost her did he realize this. Amidst
          all the artificialities and pretences and pseudo-emotionalities of his young
          actor's life, she was the one thing that was real. She alone knew of Bludston,
          of Barney Bill, of the model days the memory of which made him shiver. She alone
          (save Barney Bill) knew of his high destiny&mdash;for Paul, quick to
          recognize the cynical scepticism of an indifferent world, had not revealed the
          Vision Splendid to any of his associates. To her he could write; to her, when he
          was in London, he could talk; to her he could outpour all the jumble of faith,
          vanity, romance, egotism and poetry that was his very self, without thought of
          miscomprehension. And of late she had mastered the silly splenetics of
          childhood. He had an uncomfortable yet comforting impression that latterly she
          had developed an odd, calm wisdom, just as she had developed a calm, generous
          personality. The last time he had seen her, his quick sensitiveness had noted
          the growth from girl to woman. She was large, full-bosomed, wide-browed,
          clear-eyed. She had not worried him about other girls. She had reproved him for
          confessed follies in just the way that man loves to be reproved. She had mildly
          soared with him into the empyrean of his dreams. She had enjoyed
          whole-heartedly, from the back row of the dress-circle, the play to which he had
          taken her&mdash;as a member of the profession he had, in Jane's eyes,
          princely privileges&mdash;and on the top of the Cricklewood omnibus she had
          eaten, with the laughter and gusto of her twenty years, the exotic sandwiches he
          had <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0126" n="111"/> bought at the <hi rend="italic"
            >delicatessen</hi> shop in Leicester Square. She was the ideal sister. </p>
        <p>And now she was gone, like a snow-flake on a river. For a long while it seemed
          absurd, incredible. He went on all sorts of preposterous adventures to find her.
          He walked through the city day after day at the hours when girls and men pour
          out of their honeycombs of offices into the streets. She had never told him
          where she was employed, thinking the matter of little interest; and he, in his
          careless way, had never inquired. Once he had suggested calling for her at her
          office, and she had abruptly vetoed the suggestion. Paul was too remarkable a
          young man to escape the notice of her associates; her feelings towards him were
          too fine to be scratched by jocular allusion. After a time, having failed to
          meet her in the human torrents of Cheapside and Cannon Street, Paul gave up the
          search. Jane was lost, absolutely lost&mdash;and, with her, Barney Bill. He
          went on tour again, heavy-hearted. He felt that, in losing these two, he had
          committed an act of base ingratitude. </p>
        <p>He had been four years on the stage and had grown from youth into manhood. But
          one day at three-and-twenty he found himself as poor in pence, though as rich in
          dreams, as at thirteen. </p>
        <p>Necessity had compelled him to take what he could get. This time it was a
          leading part; but a leading part in a crude melodrama in a fit-up company. They
          had played in halls and concert rooms, on pier pavilions, in wretched little
          towns. It was glorious July Weather and business was bad&mdash;so bad that
          the manager abruptly closed the treasury and disappeared, leaving the company
          stranded a hundred and fifty miles from London, with a couple of weeks' salary
          unpaid. </p>
        <p>Paul was packing his clothes in the portmanteau <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0127" n="112"/> that lay on the narrow bed in his tiny
          back bedroom, watched disconsolately by a sallow, careworn man who sat astride
          the one cane chair, his hat on the back of his head, the discoloured end of a
          cigarette between his lips. </p>
        <p>"It's all very well for you to take it cheerfully," said the latter. "You're
          young. You're strong. You're rich. You've no one but yourself. You haven't a
          wife and kids depending on you." </p>
        <p>"I know it makes a devil of a difference," replied Paul, disregarding the
          allusion to his wealth. As the leading man, he was the most highly paid member
          of the disastrous company, and he had acquired sufficient worldly wisdom to know
          that to him who has but a penny the possessor of a shilling appears arrogantly
          opulent. "But still," said he, "what can we do? We must get back to London and
          try again." </p>
        <p>"If there was justice in this country that son of a thief would get fifteen
          years for it. I never trusted the skunk. A fortnight's salary gone and no
          railway fare to London. I wish to God I had never taken it on. I could have gone
          with Garbutt in <hi rend="italic">The White Woman</hi>&mdash;he's straight
          enough&mdash;only this was a joint engagement. Oh, the swine!" </p>
        <p>He rose with a clatter, threw his cigarette on the floor and stamped on it
          violently. </p>
        <p>"He's a pretty bad wrong 'un," said Paul. "We hadn't been going a fortnight
          before he asked me to accept half salary, swearing he would make it up, with a
          rise, as soon as business got better. Like an idiot, I consented." </p>
        <p>His friend sat down again hopelessly. "I don't know what's going to become of
          us. The missus has pawned everything she has got, poor old girl! Oh, it's damned
          hard! We had been out six months." <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0128" n="113"/>
        </p>
        <p>"Poor old chap!" said Paul, sitting on the bed beside his portmanteau. "How
          does Mrs. Wilmer take it?" </p>
        <p>"She's knocked endways. You see," cried Wilmer desperately, "we've had to send
          home everything we could scrape together to keep the kids&mdash;there's five
          of them; and now&mdash;and now there's nothing left. I'm wrong. There's
          that." He fished three or four coppers from his pocket and held them out with a
          harsh laugh. "There's that after twenty years' work in this profession." </p>
        <p>"Poor old chap!" said Paul again. He liked Wilmer, a sober, earnest,
          ineffectual man, and his haggard, kindly-natured wife. They had put on a brave
          face all through the tour, letting no one suspect their straits, and doing both
          him and other members of the company many little acts of kindness and simple
          hospitality. In the lower submerged world of the theatrical profession in which
          Paul found himself he had met with many such instances of awful poverty. He had
          brushed elbows with Need himself. That morning he had given, out of his scanty
          resources, her railway fare to a tearful and despairing girl who played the
          low-comedy part. But he had not yet come across any position quite so untenable
          as that of Wilmer. Forty odd years old, a wife, five children, all his life
          given honestly to his calling&mdash;and threepence half-penny to his
          fortune. </p>
        <p>"But, good God I" said he, after a pause, "your kiddies? If you have
          nothing&mdash;what will happen to them ?" </p>
        <p>"Lord knows," groaned Wilmer, staring in front of him, his elbows on the back
          of the chair and his head between his fists. </p>
        <p>"And Mrs. Wilmer and yourself have got to get back to London." <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0129" n="114"/>
        </p>
        <p>"I've got the dress suit I wear in the last act. It's fairly new. I can get
          enough on it." </p>
        <p>"But that's part of your outfit&mdash;your line of business; you'll want it
          again," said Paul. </p>
        <p>Wilmer had played butlers up and down the land for many years. Now and again,
          when the part did not need any special characterization, he obtained London
          engagements. He was one of the known stage butlers. </p>
        <p>"I can hire if I'm pushed," said he. "It's hell, isn't it? Something told me
          not to go out with a fit-up. We'd never come down to it before. And I mistrusted
          Larkins&mdash;but we were out six months. Paul, my boy, chuck it. You're
          young; you're clever; you've had a swell education; you come of
          gentlefolk&mdash;my father kept a small hardware shop in
          Leicester&mdash;you have"&mdash;the smitten and generally inarticulate
          man hesitated&mdash;it well, you have extraordinary personal beauty; you
          have charm; you could do anything you like in the world, save act&mdash;and
          you can't act for toffee. Why the blazes do you stick to it?" </p>
        <p>"I've got to earn my living just like you," said Paul, greatly flattered by the
          artless tribute to his aristocratic personality and not offended by the
          professional censure which he knew to be just. "I've tried all sorts of other
          things-music, painting, poetry, novel-writing&mdash;but none of them has
          come off." </p>
        <p>"Your people don't make you an allowance?" </p>
        <p>"I've no people living," said Paul, with a smile&mdash;and when Paul smiled
          it was as if Eros's feathers had brushed the cheek of a Praxitelean Hermes; and
          then with an outburst half sincere, half braggart&mdash;"I've been on my own
          ever since I was thirteen." </p>
        <p>Wilmer regarded him wearily. "The missus and I have always thought you were
          born with a silver spoon in your mouth." <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0130"
            n="115"/>
        </p>
        <p>"So I was," Paul declared from his innermost conviction. "But," he laughed, "I
          lost it before my teeth came and I could get a grip on it." </p>
        <p>"Do you mean to say," exclaimed Wilmer, "that you're not doing this for fun?" </p>
        <p>"Fun?" cried Paul. "Fun? Do you call this comic?" He waved his hand
          comprehensively, indicating the decayed pink-and-purple wall-paper, the ragged
          oil-cloth on the floor, the dingy window with its dingier outlook, the rickety
          deal wash-stand with the paint peeling off, a horrible clothless tray on a
          horrible splotchy chest of drawers, containing the horrible scraggy remains of a
          meal. "Do you think I would have this if I could command silken sloth? I long
          like hell, old chap, for silken sloth, and if I could get it, you wouldn't see
          me here." </p>
        <p>Wilmer rose and stretched out his hand. "I'm sorry, dear boy," said he. "The
          wife and I thought it didn't very much matter to you. We always thought you were
          a kind of young swell doing it for amusement and experience&mdash;and
          because you never put on side, we liked you." </p>
        <p>Paul rose from the bed and put his hand on Wilmer's shoulder. "And now you're
          disappointed ?" </p>
        <p>He laughed and his eyes twinkled humorously. His vagabond life had taught him
          some worldly wisdom. The sallow and ineffectual man looked confused. His misery
          was beyond the relief of smiles. </p>
        <p>"We're all in the same boat, old chap," said Paul, "except that I'm alone and
          haven't got wife and kids to look after." </p>
        <p>"Good-bye, my boy," said Wilmer. "Better luck next time. But chuck it, if you
          can." </p>
        <p>Paul held his hand for a while. Then his left hand dived into his waistcoat
          pocket and, taking the place <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0131" n="116"/> of his
          right, thrust three sovereigns into Wilmer's palm. "For the kiddies," said he. </p>
        <p>Wilmer looked at the coins in his palm, and then at Paul, and the tears
          spurted. "I can't, my boy. You must be as broke as any of
          us&mdash;you&mdash;half salary&mdash;no, my boy, I can't. I'm old
          enough to be your father. It's damned good of you&mdash;but it's my one
          pride left&mdash;the pride of both of us&mdash;the missus and
          me&mdash;that we've never borrowed money&mdash; " </p>
        <p>"But it isn't borrowed, you silly ass," cried Paul cheerfully. "It's just your
          share of the spoils, such as they are. I wish to God it was more." With both
          hands he clasped the thin, ineffectual fingers over the coins and pushed the
          man' with his young strength out of the door. "It's for the kiddies. Give them
          my love," he cried, and slammed the door and locked it from the inside. </p>
        <p>"Poor old chap!" said he. </p>
        <p>Then he went through his pockets and laid the contents on the narrow
          mantel-piece. These were a gold watch and chain, a cornelian heart fixed to the
          free end of the chain ' a silver cigarette case, a couple of keys, one
          sovereign, four shillings, three pennies and two half-pennies. A trunk already
          fastened and filled with books and clothes, and the portmanteau on the bed,
          contained the rest of his possessions. In current coin his whole fortune
          amounted to one pound, four shillings and fourpence. Luckily he had paid his
          landlady. One pound four and fourpence to begin again at three-and-twenty the
          battle of life on which he had entered at thirteen. He laughed because he was
          young and strong, and knew that such reverses were foreordained chapters in the
          lives of those born to a glorious destiny. They were also preordained chapters
          in the lives of those born to failure, like poor old Wilmer. He was conscious of
          the wide dif- <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0132" n="117"/> ference between Wilmer
          and himself. Good Heavens! To face the world at forty-three, with wife and
          children and threepence-halfpenny, and the once attendant hope replaced by
          black-vestured doom! Poor Wilmer! He felt certain that Wilmer had not been able
          to pay his landlady, and he felt that he had been mean in keeping back the other
          sovereign. </p>
        <p>The sudden loss, however, of three-fourths of his fortune brought him up
          against practical considerations. The more he had in his pocket when he arrived
          in London, the longer could he subsist. That was important, because theatrical
          engagements are not picked up in a hurry. Now; the railway fare would swallow a
          goodly number of shillings. Obviously it was advisable to save the railway fare;
          and the only way to do this was to walk to London. His young blood thrilled at
          the notion. It was romantic. It was also inspiring of health and joy. He had
          been rather run down lately, and, fearful of the catastrophe which had in fact
          occurred, he had lived this last week very sparingly&mdash;chiefly on
          herrings and tea. A hundred and fifty miles' tramp along the summer roads, with
          bread and cheese and an occasional glass of beer to keep him going, would be
          just the thing to set him up again. He looked in the glass. Yes, his face was a
          bit pinched and his eyes were rather too bright. A glorious tramp to London,
          thirty or forty miles a day in the blazing and beautiful sunshine, was exactly
          what he needed. </p>
        <p>Joyously he unpacked his trunk and took from it a Norfolk jacket suit and
          stockings, changed, and, leaving his luggage with his landlady, who was to obey
          further instructions as to its disposal, marched buoyantly away through the
          sun-filled streets of the little town, stick in hand, gripsack on shoulder, and
          the unquenchable fire of youth and hope in his heart.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER VIII</head>

        <p>MISS URSULA WINWOOD, hatless, but with a cotton sunshade swinging over her
          shoulder, and with a lean, shiny, mahogany-coloured Sussex spaniel trailing
          behind, walked in her calm, deliberate way down the long carriage drive of
          Drane's Court. She was stout and florid, and had no scruples as to the avowal of
          her age, which was forty-three. She had clear blue eyes which looked steadily
          upon a complicated world of affairs, and a square, heavy chin which showed her
          capacity for dealing with it. Miss Ursula Winwood knew herself to be a notable
          person, and the knowledge did not make her vain or crotchety or imperious. She
          took her notability for granted, as she took her mature good looks and her
          independent fortune. For some years she had kept house for her widowed brother,
          Colonel Winwood, Conservative Member for the Division of the county in which
          they resided, and helped him efficiently in his political work. The little
          township of Morebury&mdash;half a mile from the great gates of Drane's
          Court&mdash;felt Miss Winwood's control in diverse ways. Another town, a
          little further off, with five or six millions of inhabitants, was also, through
          its newspapers, aware of Miss Winwood. Many leagues, societies, associations,
          claimed her as President, Vice-President, or Member of Council. She had sat on
          Royal Commissions. Her name under an appeal for charity guaranteed the deserts
          of the beneficiaries. What she did not know about housing <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0134" n="119"/> problems, factory acts, female prisons,
          hospitals, asylums for the blind, decayed gentlewomen, sweated trades, dogs'
          homes and Friendly Societies could not be considered in the light of knowledge.
          She sat on platforms with Royal princesses, Archbishops welcomed her as a
          colleague, and Cabinet Ministers sought her counsel. </p>
        <p>For some distance from the porch of the red-brick, creeper-covered Queen-Anne
          house the gravel drive between the lawns blazed in the afternoon sun. For this
          reason, the sunshade. But after a while came an avenue of beech and plane and
          oak casting delectable shade on the drive and its double edging of grass, and
          the far-stretching riot of flowers beneath the trees, foxgloves and canterbury
          bells and campanulas and delphiniums, all blues and purples and whites, with
          here and there the pink of dog-roses and gorgeous yellow splashes of celandine.
          On entering the stately coolness, Miss Winwood closed her sunshade and looked at
          her watch, a solid timepiece harboured in her belt. A knitted brow betrayed
          mathematical calculation. It would take her five minutes to reach the lodge
          gate. The train bringing her venerable uncle, Archdeacon Winwood, for a week's
          visit would not arrive at the station for another three minutes, and the two fat
          horses would take ten minutes to drag from the station the landau which she had
          sent to meet him. She had, therefore, eight minutes to spare. A rustic bench
          invited repose. Graciously she accepted the invitation. </p>
        <p>Now, it must be observed that it was not Miss Winwood's habit to waste time.
          Her appointments were kept to the minute, and her appointment (self-made on this
          occasion) was the welcoming of her uncle, the Archdeacon, on the threshold of
          Drane's Court. But Miss Winwood was making holiday and allowed her <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0135" n="120"/> self certain relaxations. Her brother's
          health having broken down, he had paired for the rest of the session and gone to
          Contrexeville for a cure. She had therefore shut up her London house in Portland
          Place, Colonel Winwood's home while Parliament sat, and had come to her
          brother's house, Drane's Court, her home when her presence was not needed in
          London. She was tired; Drane's Court, where she had been born and had lived all
          her girlhood's life, was restful; and the seat in the shade of the great beech
          was cunningly curved. The shiny, mahogany-coloured spaniel, prescient of siesta,
          leaped to her side and lay down with his chin on her lap and blinked his yellow
          eyes. </p>
        <p>She lay back on the seat, her hand on the dog's head, looking contentedly at
          the opposite wilderness of bloom and the glimpses, through the screen of trees
          and shrubs, of the sunlit stretches of park beyond. She loved Drane's Court.
          Save for the three years of her brother's short married life, it had been part
          of herself. A Winwood, a very younger son of the Family-the Family being that of
          which the Earl of Harpenden is Head (these things can only be written of in
          capital letters)&mdash;had acquired wealth in the dark political days of
          Queen Anne, and had bought the land and built the house, and the property had
          never passed into alien hands. As for the name, he had used that of his wife,
          Viscountess Drane in her own right, -a notorious beauty of whom, so History
          recounts, he was semlely enamoured and on whose naughty account he was
          eventually run through the body by a young Mohawk of a paramour. They fought one
          spring dawn in the park-the traditional spot could be seen from where Ursula
          Winwood was sitting. </p>
        <p>Ursula and her brother were proud of the romantic episode, and would relate it
          to guests and point out <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0136" n="121"/> the scene of
          the duel. Happy and illusory days of Romance now dead and gone! It is not
          conceivable that, generations hence, the head of a family will exhibit with
          pride the stained newspaper cuttings containing the unsavoury details of the
          divorce case of his great-great-grandmother. </p>
        <p>This aspect of family history seldom presented itself to Ursula Winwood. It did
          not do so this mellow and contented afternoon. Starlings mindful of a second
          brood chattered in the old walnut trees far away on the lawn; thrushes sang
          their deep-throated bugle-calls; finches twittered. A light breeze creeping up
          the avenue rustled the full foliage languorously. Ursula Winwood closed her
          eyes. A bumble-bee droned between visits to foxglove bells near by. She loved
          bumble-bees. They reminded her of a summer long ago when she sat, not on this
          seat&mdash;as a matter of fact it was in the old walled garden a quarter of
          a mile away&mdash;with a gallant young fellow's arms about her and her head
          on his shoulder. A bumble-bee had droned round her while they kissed. She could
          never hear a bumble-bee without thinking of it. But the gallant young fellow had
          been killed in the Soudan in eighteen eighty-five, and Ursula Winwood's heart
          had been buried in his sandy grave. That was the beginning and end of her
          sentimental history. She had recovered from the pain of it all and now she
          .Loved the bumble-bee for invoking the exquisite memory. The lithe Sussex
          spaniel crept farther on her lap and her hand caressed his polished coat.
          Drowsiness disintegrated the exquisite memories. Miss Ursula Winwood fell
          asleep. </p>
        <p>The sudden plunging of strong young paws into her body and a series of sharp
          barks and growls awakened her with a start, and, for a second, still dazed by
          the drowsy invocation of the bumble-bee, she saw approaching <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0137" n="122"/> her the gallant fellow who had been
          pierced through the heart by a Soudanese spear in eighteen eighty-five. He was
          dark and handsome, and, by a trick of coincidence, was dressed in loose
          knickerbocker suit, just as he was when he had walked up that very avenue to say
          his last good-bye. She remained for a moment tense, passively awaiting
          co-ordination of her faculties. Then clear awake, and sending scudding the dear
          ghosts of the past, she sat up, and catching the indignant spaniel by the
          collar, looked with a queer, sudden interest at the newcomer. He was young,
          extraordinarily beautiful; but he staggered and reeled like a drunken man. The
          spaniel barked his respectable disapproval. In his long life of eighteen months
          he had seen many people, postmen and butcher boys and casual diggers in kitchen
          gardens, whose apparent permit to exist in Drane's Court had been an insoluble
          puzzle; but never had he seen so outrageous a trespasser. With unparalleled
          moral courage he told him exactly what he thought of him. But the trespasser did
          not hear. He kept on advancing. Miss Winwood rose, disgusted, and drew herself
          up. The young man threw out his hands towards her, tripped over the
          three-inch-high border of grass, and fell in a sprawling heap at her feet. </p>
        <p>He lay very still. Ursula Winwood looked down upon him. The shiny brown spaniel
          took up a strategic position three yards away and growled, his chin between his
          paws. But the more Miss Winwood looked, and her blue eyes were trained to
          penetrate, the more was she convinced that both she and the dog were wrong in
          their diagnosis. The young man's face was deadly white, his cheeks gaunt. It was
          evidently a grave matter. For a moment or so she had a qualm of fear lest he
          might be dead. She bent down, took him in her capable grip and composed his
          inert body <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0138" n="Illustration"/>
          <!--<head>He threw out his hands towards her, tripped over the border of grass, and fell in a sprawling heap at her  
                    feet.</head>-->
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0139"/>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0140" n="123"/> decently, and placed the knapsack he
          was wearing beneath his head. The faintly beating heart proved him to be alive,
          but her touch on his brow discovered fever. Kneeling by his side, she wiped his
          lips with her handkerchief, and gave herself up to the fraction of a minute's
          contemplation of the most beautiful youth she had ever seen. So there he lay, a
          new Endymion, while the most modern of Dianas hung over him, stricken with great
          wonderment at his perfection. </p>
        <p>In this romantic attitude was she surprised, first by the coachman of the
          landau and pair as he swung round the bend of the drive, and then by the
          Archdeacon, who leaned over the door of the carriage. Miss Winwood sprang to her
          feet; the coachman pulled up, and the Archdeacon alighted. </p>
        <p>"My dear Uncle Edward"&mdash;she wrung his hand&mdash;"I'm so glad to
          see you. Do help me grapple with an extraordinary situation." </p>
        <p>The Archdeacon smiled humorously. He was a spare man of seventy, with thin,
          pointed, clean-shaven face, and clear blue eyes like Miss Winwood's. "If there's
          a situation, my dear Ursula, with which you can't grapple," said he, "it must
          indeed be extraordinary." </p>
        <p>She narrated what had occurred, and together they bent over the unconscious
          youth. "I would suggest," said she, "that we put him into the carriage, drive
          him up to the house, and send for Dr. Fuller." </p>
        <p>"I can only support your suggestion," said the Archdeacon. </p>
        <p>So the coachman came down from his box and helped them to lift the young man
          into the landau; and his body swayed helplessly between Miss Winwood and the
          Archdeacon, whose breeches and gaiters were smeared with dust from his heavy
          boots. A few <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0141" n="124"/> moments afterwards he
          was carried into the library and laid upon a sofa, and Miss Winwood administered
          restoratives. The deep stupor seemed to pass, and he began to moan. </p>
        <p>Miss Winwood and the housekeeper stood by his side. The Archdeacon, his hands
          behind his back, paced the noiseless Turkey carpet. "I hope," said he, "your
          doctor will not be long in coming." </p>
        <p>"It looks like a sunstroke," the housekeeper remarked, as her mistress
          scrutinized the clinical thermometer. </p>
        <p>"It doesn't," said Miss Winwood bluntly. "In sunstroke the face is either
          congested or clammy. I know that much. He has a temperature of 103." </p>
        <p>"Poor fellow!" said the Archdeacon. </p>
        <p>"I wonder who he is," said Miss Winwood. </p>
        <p>"Perhaps this may tell us," said the Archdeacon. </p>
        <p>From the knapsack, carelessly handled by the servant who had brought it in, had
          escaped a book, and the servant had laid the book on the top of the knapsack.
          The Archdeacon took it up. </p>
        <p>"Sir Thomas Browne's <hi rend="italic">Religio Medici</hi> and <hi
            rend="italic">Urn Burial</hi>. On the flyleaf, 'Paul Savelli.' An
          undergraduate, I should say, on a walking tour." </p>
        <p>Miss Winwood took the book from his hands&mdash;a little cheap reprint.
          "I'm glad," she said. </p>
        <p>"Why, my dear Ursula?" </p>
        <p>"I'm very fond of Sir Thomas Browne, myself," she replied. </p>
        <p>Presently the doctor came and made his examination. He shook a grave head.
          "Pneumonia. And he has got it bad. Perhaps a touch of the sun as well." The
          housekeeper smiled discreetly. "Looks half-starved, too. I'll send up the
          ambulance at once and get him to the cottage hospital." </p>
        <p>Miss Winwood, a practical woman, was aware that <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0142" n="125"/> the doctor gave wise counsel. But she
          looked at Paul and hesitated. Paul's destiny, though none knew it, hung in the
          balance. "I disapprove altogether of the cottage hospital," she said. </p>
        <p>"Eh?" said the doctor. </p>
        <p>The Archdeacon raised his eyebrows. "My dear Ursula, I thought you had made the
          Morebury Cottage Hospital the model of its kind." </p>
        <p>"Its kind is not for people who carry about Sir Thomas Browne in their pocket,"
          retorted the disingenuous lady. "If I turned him out of my house, doctor, and
          anything happened to him, I should have to reckon with his people. He stays
          here. You'll kindly arrange for nurses. The red room, Wilkins, &mdash;no,
          the green&mdash;the one with the small oak bed. You can't nurse people
          properly in four-posters. It has a south-east aspect"&mdash;she turned to
          the doctor&mdash;"and so gets the sun most of the day. That's quite right,
          isn't it ?" </p>
        <p>"Ideal. But I warn you, Miss Winwood, you may be letting yourself in for a
          perfectly avoidable lot of trouble." </p>
        <p>"I like trouble," said Miss Winwood. </p>
        <p>"You're certainly looking for it," replied the doctor glancing at Paul and
          stuffing his stethoscope into his pocket. "And in this case, I can promise you
          worry beyond dreams of anxiety." </p>
        <p>The word of Ursula Winwood was law for miles around. Dr. Fuller, rosy, fat and
          fifty, obeyed, like everyone else; but during the process of law-making he had
          often, before now, played the part of an urbane and gently satirical leader of
          the opposition. </p>
        <p>She flashed round on him, with a foolish pain through her heart that caused her
          to catch her breath. "Is he as bad as that?" she asked quickly. </p>
        <p>"As bad as that," said the doctor, with grave signi- <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0143" n="126"/> ficance. "How he managed to get here is
          a mystery!" Within a quarter-of-an-hour the unconscious Paul, clad in a suit of
          Colonel Winwood's silk pyjamas, lay in a fragrant room, hung with green and
          furnished in old, black oak. Never once, in all his life, had Paul Kegworthy
          lain in such a room. And for him a great house was in commotion. Messages went
          forth for nurses and medicines and the paraphernalia of a luxurious
          sick-chamber, and-the lady of the house being absurdly anxious&mdash;for a
          great London specialist, whose fee, in Dr. Fuller's quiet eyes, would be
          amusingly fantastic. </p>
        <p>"It seems horrible to search the poor boy's pockets," said Miss Winwood, when,
          after these excursions and alarms the Archdeacon and herself had returned to the
          library; "but we must try to find out who he is and communicate with his people.
          Savelli. I've never heard of them. I wonder who they are." </p>
        <p>"There is an historical Italian family of that name," said the Archdeacon. </p>
        <p>"I was sure of it," said Miss Winwood. </p>
        <p>"Of what?" </p>
        <p>"That his people&mdash;are&mdash;well&mdash;all right." </p>
        <p>"Why are you sure?" </p>
        <p>Ursula was very fond of her uncle. He represented to her the fine flower of the
          Church of England&mdash;a gentleman, a scholar, an ideal physical type of
          the Anglican dignitary, a man of unquestionable piety and Christian charity, a
          personage who would be recognized for what he was by Hottentots or Esquimaux or
          attendants of <hi rend="italic">wagon-lits</hi> trains or millionaires of the
          Middle West of America or Parisian Apaches. In him the branch of the family tree
          had burgeoned into the perfect cleric. Yet sometimes, the play of light beneath
          the surface of those blue eyes, so like her own, and the delicately intoned
          challenges of his <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0144" n="127"/> courtly voice,
          exasperated her beyond measure. "It's obvious to any idiot, my dear," she
          replied testily. "Just look at him. It speaks for itself." </p>
        <p>The Archdeacon put his thin hand on her plump shoulder, and smiled. The old man
          had a very sunny smile. "I'm sorry to carry on a conversation so Socratically,"
          said he. "But what is 'it'?" </p>
        <p>"I've never seen anything so physically beautiful, save the statues in the
          Vatican, in all my life. If he's not an aristocrat to the finger tips, I'll give
          up all my work, turn Catholic, and go into a nunnery&mdash;which will
          distress you exceedingly. And then"&mdash;she waved a plump
          hand&mdash;"and then, as I've mentioned before, he reads the <hi
            rend="italic">Religio Medici</hi>. The commonplace, vulgar young man of to-day
          no more reads Sir Thomas Browne than he reads Tertullian or the Upanishads." </p>
        <p>"He also reads," said the Archdeacon, stuffing his hand into Paul's knapsack,
          against whose canvas the stiff outline of a book revealed itself&mdash;"he
          also reads"&mdash;he held up a little fat duodecimo&mdash;"the <hi
            rend="italic">Chansons de Beranger</hi>." </p>
        <p>"That proves it," cried Miss Winwood. </p>
        <p>"Proves what?" </p>
        <p>His blue eyes twinkled. Having a sense of humour, she laughed and flung her
          great arm round his frail shoulders. "It proves, my venerable and otherwise
          distinguished dear, that I am right and you are wrong." </p>
        <p>"My good Ursula," said he, disengaging himself, "I have not advanced one
          argument either in favour of, or in opposition to, one single proposition the
          whole of this afternoon." </p>
        <p>She shook her head at him pityingly. </p>
        <p>The housekeeper entered carrying a double handful of odds and ends which she
          laid on the library table&mdash;a watch and chain and cornelian heart, a
          cigarette <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0145" n="128"/> case bearing the initials
          "P.S.,"" some keys, a very soiled handkerchief, a sovereign, a shilling and a
          penny. Dr. Fuller had sent them down with his compliments; they were the entire
          contents of the young gentleman's pockets. </p>
        <p>"Not a card, not a scrap of paper with a name and address on it?" cried Miss
          Winwood. </p>
        <p>"Not a scrap, miss. The doctor and I searched most thoroughly." </p>
        <p>"Perhaps the knapsack will tell us more," said the Archdeacon. </p>
        <p>The knapsack, however, revealed nothing but a few toilet necessaries, a hunk of
          stale bread and a depressing morsel of cheese, and a pair of stockings and a
          shirt declared by the housekeeper to be wet through. As the Beranger, like the
          Sir Thomas Browne, was inscribed "Paul Savelli," which corresponded with the
          initials on the cigarette case, they were fairly certain of the young man's
          name. But that was all they could discover regarding him. </p>
        <p>"We'll have to wait until he can tell us himself," said Miss Winwood later to
          the doctor. </p>
        <p>"We'll have to wait a long time," said he.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER IX</head>

        <p>THE London physician arrived, sat up with Paul most of the night, and went away
          the next morning saying that he was a dead man. Dr. Fuller, however, advanced
          the uncontrovertible opinion that a man was not dead till he died; and Paul was
          not dead yet. As a matter of fact, Paul did not die. If he had done so, there
          would have been an end of him and this history would never have been written. He
          lay for many days at the gates of Death, and Miss Winwood, terribly fearful lest
          they should open and the mysterious, unconscious shape of beauty and youth
          should pass through, had all the trouble promised her by the doctor. But the
          gates remained shut. When Paul took a turn for the better, the London physician
          came down again and declared that he was living in defiance of all the laws of
          pathology, and with a graceful compliment left the case in the hands of Dr.
          Fuller. When his life was out of danger, Dr. Fuller attributed the miracle to
          the nurses; Ursula Winwood attributed it to Dr. Fuller; the London physician to
          Paul's superb constitution; and Paul himself, perhaps the most wisely, to the
          pleasant-faced, masterful lady who had concentrated on his illness all the
          resources of womanly tenderness. </p>
        <p>But it was a long time before Paul was capable of formulating such an opinion.
          It was a long time before he could formulate any opinion at all. When not
          delirious or comatose, he had the devil of pleurisy tearing at the wall of his
          lung like a wild cat. Only <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0147" n="130"/> gradually
          did he begin to observe and to question. That noiseless woman in coot blue and
          white was a nurse. He knew that. So he must be in hospital. But the room was
          much smaller than a hospital ward; and where were the other patients? The
          question worried him for a whole morning. Then there was a pink-faced man in
          gold spectacles, Obviously the doctor. Then there was a sort of nurse whom he
          liked very much, but she was not in uniform. Who could she be? He realized that
          he was ill, as weak as a butterfly; and the pain when he coughed was agonizing.
          It was all very odd. How had he come here? He remembered walking along a dusty
          road in the blazing sun, his head bursting, every limb a moving ache. He also
          vaguely remembered being awakened at night by a thunder storm as he lay snugly
          asleep beneath a hedge. The German Ocean had fallen down upon him. He was quite
          sure it was the German Ocean, because he had fixed it in his head by repeating
          "the North Sea or German Ocean." Mixing up delirious dream with fact, he clearly
          remembered the green waves rearing themselves up first, an immeasurable wall,
          then spreading a translucent canopy beneath the firmament and then descending in
          awful deluge. He had a confused memory of morning sunshine, of a cottage, of a
          hard-featured woman, of sitting before a fire with a blanket round his
          shoulders, of a toddling child smeared to the eyebrows with dirt and treacle
          whom he had wanted to wash. Over and over again, lately, he had wanted to wash
          that child, but it had always eluded his efforts. Once he had thought of
          scraping it with a bit of hoof-iron, but it had turned into a Stilton cheese. It
          was all very puzzling. Then he had gone on tramping along the high road. What
          was that about bacon and eggs? The horrible smell offended his nostrils. It must
          have been a wayside <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0148" n="131"/> inn; and a woman
          twenty feet high with a face like a cauliflower&mdash;or was it
          spinach?&mdash;or Brussels sprouts?&mdash;silly not to
          remember&mdash;one of the three, certainly&mdash;desired to murder him
          with a thousand eggs bubbling up against rank reefs of bacon. He had escaped
          from her somehow, and he had been very lucky. His star had saved him. It had
          also saved him from a devil on a red-hot bicycle. He had stood quite still, calm
          and undismayed, in the awful path of the straddling Apollyon whose head was girt
          around with yellow fire, and had seen him swerve madly and fall off the machine.
          And when the devil had picked himself up, he had tried to blast him with the
          Great Curse of the Underworld; but Paul had shown him his cornelian heart, his
          talisman, and the devil had remounted his glowing vehicle and had ridden away in
          a spume of flame. The Father of Lies had tried to pass himself off as a postman.
          The memory of the shallow pretence tickled Paul so that he laughed; and then he
          half fainted in pleuritic agony. </p>
        <p>After the interlude with the devil he could recollect little. He was going up
          to London to make his fortune. A princess was waiting for him at the golden gate
          of London, with a fortune piled up in a coachand-six. But being very sick and
          dizzy, he thought he would sit down and rest in a great green cathedral whose
          doors stood invitingly open . . . and now he found himself in the hospital ward.
          Sometimes he felt a desire to question the blue-and-white nurse, but it seemed
          too much trouble to move his lips. Then in a flash came the solution of the
          puzzle, and he chuckled to himself over his cunning. Of course it was a dream.
          The nurse was a dream-nurse, who wanted to make him believe that she was real.
          But she was not clever enough. The best way to pay her <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0149" n="132"/> out for her deception was to take no
          notice of her whatsoever. So comforted, he would go to sleep. </p>
        <p>At last one morning he woke, a miserably weak but perfectly sane man, and he
          turned his head from side to side and looked wonderingly at the fresh and
          exquisite room. A bowl of Morning Glow roses stood by his bedside, gracious
          things for fevered eyes to rest upon. A few large photographs of famous pictures
          hung on the walls. In front of him was the Santa Barbara of Palma Vecchio, which
          he recognized with a smile. He had read about it, and knew that the original was
          in Venice. Knowledge of things like that was comforting. </p>
        <p>The nurse, noticing the change, came up to him and spoke in a soothing voice.
          "Are you feeling better?" </p>
        <p>"I think so "said Paul. "I suppose I've been very ill." </p>
        <p>"Very ill," said the nurse. </p>
        <p>"This can't be a hospital?" </p>
        <p>"Oh, no. It's the house of some very kind, good friends. You don't know them,"
          she added quickly, seeing him knit a perplexed brow. "You stumbled into their
          garden and fainted. And they're very anxious for you to get well and strong." </p>
        <p>"Who are they?" asked Paul. </p>
        <p>"Colonel and Miss Winwood. T hey will be so glad to see you better&mdash;at
          least Miss Winwood will; the Colonel's not at home." </p>
        <p>She lifted his head gently and smoothed his pillows, and ordained silence.
          Presently the doctor came, and spoke kindly. "You've had a narrow shave, my
          friend, and you're not out of the wood yet," said he. "And you'll have to go
          slow and take things for granted for some time." </p>
        <p>Then came Miss Winwood, whom he recognized as the puzzling but pleasant nurse
          out of uniform. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0150" n="133"/>
        </p>
        <p>"I don't know how to thank you for taking me in, a stranger, like this," said
          Paul. </p>
        <p>She smiled. "It's Providence, not me, that you must thank. You might have been
          taken ill by the roadside far away from anybody. Providence guided you here." </p>
        <p>"Providence or Destiny," murmured Paul, closing his eyes. It was absurd to feel
          so weak. </p>
        <p>"That's a theological question on which we won't enter," laughed Miss Winwood.
          "Anyhow, thank God, you're better." </p>
        <p>A little later she came to him again. "I've been so anxious about your
          people&mdash;you see, we've had no means of communicating with them." </p>
        <p>"My people?" asked Paul, surprised. </p>
        <p>"Yes. They must be wondering what has become of you." </p>
        <p>"I have no people," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"No people? What do you mean?" she asked sharply, for the moment forgetful of
          the sick room. She herself had hundreds of relations. The branches of her family
          tree were common to half the country families of England. "Have you no
          parents&mdash;brothers or sisters&mdash;?" </p>
        <p>"None that I know of," said Paul. "I'm quite alone in the world." </p>
        <p>"Have you no friends to whom I could write about you?" </p>
        <p>He shook his head, and his great eyes, all the greater and more lustrous
          through illness, smiled into hers. "No. None that count. At
          least&mdash;there are two friends, but I've lost sight of them for years.
          No&mdash;there's nobody who would be in the least interested to know. Please
          don't trouble. I shall be all right." </p>
        <p>Miss Winwood put her cool hand on his forehead <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0151"
            n="134"/> and bent over him. "You? You, alone like that? My poor boy!" </p>
        <p>She turned away. It was almost incredible. It was monstrously pathetic. The
          phenomenon baffled her. Tears came into her eyes. She had imagined him the
          darling of mother and sisters; the gay centre of troops of friends. And he was
          alone on the earth. Who was he? She turned again. </p>
        <p>"Will you tell me your name?" </p>
        <p>"Savelli. Paul Savelli." </p>
        <p>"I thought so. It was in the two books in your knapsack. A historical Italian
          name." </p>
        <p>"Yes," said Paul. "Noble. All dead." </p>
        <p>He lay back, exhausted. Suddenly a thought smote him. He beckoned. She
          approached. "My heart--is it safe?" he whispered. </p>
        <p>"Your heart?" </p>
        <p>"At the end of my watch-chain." I "Quite safe." </p>
        <p>"Could I have it near me?" </p>
        <p>"Of course." </p>
        <p>Paul closed his eyes contentedly. With his talisman in his hand, all would be
          well. For the present he need take thought of nothing. His presence in the
          beautiful room being explained, there was an end of the perplexity of his
          semi-delirium. Of payment for evident devoted service there could be no
          question. Time enough when he grew well and able to fare forth again, to
          consider the immediate future. He was too weak to lift his head, and something
          inside him hurt like the devil when he moved. Why worry about outer and
          unimportant matters? The long days of pain and illness slipped gradually away.
          Miss Winwood sat by his bedside and talked; but not until he was much stronger
          did she question him as to his antecedents. The Archdeacon had gone <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0152" n="135"/> away after a week's visit without being
          able to hold any converse with Paul; Colonel Winwood was still at Contrexeville,
          whence he wrote sceptically of the rare bird whom Ursula had discovered; and
          Ursula was alone in the house, save for a girl friend who had no traffic with
          the sick-chamber. She had, therefore, much leisure to devote to Paul. Her
          brother's scepticism most naturally strengthened her belief in him. He was her
          discovery. He grew almost to be her invention. just consider. Here was a young
          Greek god&mdash;everyone who had a bowing acquaintance with ancient
          sculpture immediately likened Paul to a Greek god, and Ursula was not so far
          different from her cultured fellow mortals as to liken him to anything
          else&mdash;hcre was a young Phoebus Apollo, all the more Olympian because of
          his freedom from earthly ties, fallen straight from the clouds. He had fallen at
          her feet. His beauty had stirred her. His starlike loneliness had touched her
          heart. His swift intelligence, growing more manifest each day as he grew
          stronger, moved her admiration. He had, too, she realized, a sunny and sensuous
          nature, alive to beauty&mdash;even the beauty of the trivial things in his
          sickroom. He had an odd, poetical trick of phrase. He was a paragon of young
          Greek gods. She had discovered him; and women don't discover even mortal
          paragons every day in the week. Also, she was a woman of forty-three, which,
          after all, is not wrinkled and withered eld; and she was not a soured woman; she
          radiated health and sweetness; she had loved once in her life, very dearly.
          Romance touched her with his golden feather and, in the most sensible and the
          most unreprehensible way in the world, she fell in love with Paul. </p>
        <p>"I wonder what made you put that Santa Barbara of Palma Vecchio just opposite
          the bed," he said one <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0153" n="136"/> day. He had
          advanced so far toward recovery as to be able to sit up against his pillows. </p>
        <p>"Don't you like it?" She turned in her chair by his bedside. </p>
        <p>"I worship it. Do you know, she has a strange look of you? When I was half off
          my head I used to mix you up together. She has such a generous and holy
          bigness&mdash;the generosity of the All-woman." </p>
        <p>Ursula flushed at the personal tribute, but let it pass without comment. "It's
          not a bad photograph; but the original&mdash;that is too lovely." </p>
        <p>"It's in the Church of Santa Maria Formosa in Venice," said Paul quickly. </p>
        <p>He had passed through a period of wild enthusiasm for Italian painting, and had
          haunted the National Gallery, and knew by heart Sir Charles Eastlake's edition
          of Kugler's unique textbook. </p>
        <p>"Ah, you know it?" said Ursula. </p>
        <p>"I've never been to Venice," replied Paul, with a sigh. "It's the dream of my
          life to go there." </p>
        <p>She straightened herself on her chair. "How do you know the name of the
          church?" </p>
        <p>Paul smiled and looked round the walls, and reflected for a moment. "Yes," said
          he in answer to his own questioning, "I think I can tell you where all these
          pictures are, though I've never seen them, except one. The two angels by Melozzo
          da Forli are in St. Peter's at Rome. The Sposalia of Raphael is in the Breza,
          Milan. The Andrea del Sarto is in the Louvre. That's the one I've seen. That
          little child of Heaven, playing the lute, is in the predella of an altar-piece
          by Vittore Carpaccio in the&mdash;in the&mdash;please don't tell
          me&mdash;in the Academia of Venice. Am I right ?" </p>
        <p>"Absolutely right," said Miss Winwood. </p>
        <p>He laughed, delighted. At three and twenty, one <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0154" n="137"/> thank goodness!&mdash;is very
          young. One hungers for recognition of the wonder-inspiring self that lies hidden
          beneath the commonplace mask of clay. "And that," said he&mdash;"the Madonna
          being crowned&mdash;the Botticelli&mdash;is in the Uffizi at Florence.
          Walter Pater talks about it&mdash;you know&mdash;in his
          'Renaissance'&mdash;the pen dropping from her hand&mdash;'the high, cold
          words that have no meaning for her&mdash;the intolerable honour'! Oh, it's
          enormous, isn't it?" </p>
        <p>"I'm afraid I've not read my Pater as I ought," said Miss Winwood. </p>
        <p>"But, you must!" cried Paul, with the gloriously audacious faith of youth which
          has just discovered a true apostle. "Pater puts you on to the inner meaning of
          everything&mdash;in art, I mean. He doesn't wander about in the air like
          Ruskin, though, of course, if you get your mental winnowing machine in proper
          working order you can get the good grain out of Ruskin. 'The Stones of Venice'
          and 'The Seven Lamps' have taught me a lot. But you always have to be saying to
          yourself, 'Is this gorgeous nonsense or isn't it?' whereas in Pater there's no
          nonsense at all. You're simply carried along on a full stream of Beauty straight
          into the open Sea of Truth." </p>
        <p>And Ursula Winwood, to whom Archbishops had been deferential and Cabinet
          Ministers had come for, guidance, meekly promised to send at once for Pater's
          'Renaissance' and so fill in a most lamentable gap in her education. </p>
        <p>"My uncle, the Archdeacon," she said, after a while, "reminded me that the
          great Savelli was a Venetian general&mdash;of Roman family; and, strangely
          enough, his name, too, was Paul. Perhaps that's how you got the name." </p>
        <p>"That must be how," said Paul dreamily. He had not heard of the great general.
          He had seen the <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0155" n="138"/> name of Savelli
          somewhere&mdash;also that of Torelli&mdash; and had hesitated between
          the two. Thinking it no great harm, he wove into words the clamour of his
          cherished romance. "My parents died when I was quite young&mdash;a
          baby&mdash;and then I was brought to England. So you see"&mdash;he
          smiled in his winning way&mdash;"I'm absolutely English." </p>
        <p>"But you've kept your Italian love of beauty." </p>
        <p>"I hope so," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Then I suppose you were brought up by guardians," said Ursula. </p>
        <p>"A guardian," said Paul, anxious to cut down to a minimum the mythical
          personages that might be connected with his career. "But I seldom saw him. He
          lived in Paris chiefly. He's dead now." </p>
        <p>"What a poor little uncared-for waif you must have been." </p>
        <p>Paul laughed. "Oh, don't pity me. I've had to think for myself a good deal, it
          is true. But it has done me good. Don't you find it's the things one learns for
          oneself&mdash;whether they are about life or old china&mdash;that are
          the most valuable?" </p>
        <p>"Of course," said Miss Winwood. But she sighed, womanlike, at the thought of
          the little Paul&mdash;(how beautiful he must have been as a
          child!)&mdash;being brought up by servants and hirelings in a lonely house,
          his very guardian taking no concern in his welfare. </p>
        <p>Thus it came about that, from the exiguous material supplied by Paul, Miss
          Winwood, not doubting his gentle birth and breeding, constructed for him a
          wholly fictitious set of antecedents. Paul invented as little as possible and
          gratefully accepted her suggestions. They worked together unconsciously. Paul
          had to give some account of himself. He had blotted Bludston and his modeldom
          out of his existence. The passionate belief in his high and romantic birth was
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0156" n="139"/> part of his being, and Miss
          Winwood's recognition was a splendid confirmation of his faith. It was rather
          the <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="it">suppressio veri</foreign>
          </hi> of which he was guilty than the <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="it">propositio falsi</foreign>
          </hi>. So between them his childhood was invested with a vague semblance of
          reality in which the fact of his isolation stood out most prominent. </p>
        <p>They had many talks together, not only on books and art, but on the social
          subjects in which Ursula was so deeply interested. She found him well informed,
          with a curiously detailed knowledge of the everyday lives of the poor. It did
          not occur to her that this knowledge came from his personal experience. She
          attributed it to the many-sided genius of her paragon. </p>
        <p>"When you get well you must help us. There's an infinite amount to be done." </p>
        <p>"I shall be delighted," said Paul politely. </p>
        <p>"You'll find I'm a terrible person to deal with when once I've laid my hands on
          anybody," she said with a smile. "I drag in all kinds of people, and they can't
          escape. I sent young Harry Gostling&mdash;Lord Ruthmere's son, you
          know&mdash;to look into a working girls' club in the Isle of Dogs that was
          going wrong. He hated it at first, but now he's as keen as possible. And you'll
          be keen too." </p>
        <p>It was flattering to be classified with leisured and opulent young Guardsmen;
          but what, Paul reflected with a qualm, would the kind lady say if she learned
          the real state of his present fortunes? He thought of the guinea that lay
          between him and starvation, and was amused by the irony of her proposition. Miss
          Winwood evidently took it for granted that he was in easy circumstances, living
          on the patrimony administered during his boyhood by a careless guardian. He
          shrank from undeceiving her. His dream was beginning to come true. He was
          accepted by one of the <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0157" n="140"/> high caste as
          belonging to the world where princes and princesses dwelt serene. If only he
          could put the theatre behind him, as he had put the rest, and make a
          stepping-stone of his dead actor self! But that was impossible, or at least the
          question would have to be fought out between himself and fortune after he had
          left Drane's Court. In the meanwhile he glowed with the ambition to leave it in
          his newly acquired splendour, drums beating, banners flying, the young prince
          returning to his romantic and mysterious solitude. </p>
        <p>The time was approaching when he should get up. He sent for his luggage. The
          battered trunk and portmanteau plastered with the labels of queer provincial
          towns did not betray great wealth. Nor did the contents, taken out by the
          man-servant and arranged in drawers by the nurse. His toilet paraphernalia was
          of the simplest and scantiest. His stock of frayed linen and darned underclothes
          made rather a poor little heap on the chair. He watched the unpacking somewhat
          wistfully from his bed; and, like many another poor man, inwardly resented his
          poverty being laid bare to the eyes of the servants of the rich. </p>
        <p>The only thing that the man seemed to handle respectfully&mdash;as a
          recognized totem of a superior caste&mdash;was a brown canvas case of golf
          clubs, which he stood up in a conspicuous corner of the room. Paul had taken to
          the Ancient and Royal game when first he went on tour, and it had been a
          health-giving resource during the listless days when there was no rehearsal or
          no matin&#x00E9;e&mdash;hundreds of provincial actors, to say nothing of
          retired colonels and such-like derelicts, owe their salvation of body and soul
          to the absurd but hygienic pastime&mdash;and with a naturally true eye and a
          harmonious body trained to all demands on its sup- <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0158" n="141"/> pleness in the gymnasium, proficiency
          had come with little trouble. He was a born golfer; for the physically perfect
          human is a born anything physical you please. But he had not played for a long
          time. Half-crowns had been very scarce on this last disastrous tour, and
          comrades who included golf in their horizon of human possibilities had been
          rarer. When would he play again? Heaven knew! So he looked wistfully, too, at
          his set of golf clubs. He remembered how he had bought them&mdash;one by
          one. </p>
        <p>"Do you want this on the dressing table?" The nurse held up a little oblong
          case. </p>
        <p>It was his make-up box, luckily tied round with string. </p>
        <p>"Good heavens, no!" he exclaimed. He wished he could have told her to burn it.
          He felt happier when all his belongings were stowed away out of sight and the
          old trunk and portmanteau hauled out of the room. </p>
        <p>Colonel Winwood came home and asked his sister pertinent questions. He was a
          bald, sad-looking man with a long grizzling moustache that drooped despondently.
          But he had a square, obstinate chin, and his eyes, though they seldom smiled,
          were keen and direct, like Miss Winwood's. Romance had passed him by long since.
          He did not believe in paragons. </p>
        <p>"I gather, my dear Ursula," said he in a dry voice, "that our guest is an
          orphan, of good Italian family, brought up in England by a guardian now dead who
          lived in France. Also that he is of prepossessing exterior, of agreeable
          manners, of considerable cultivation, and apparently of no acquaintance. But
          what I can't make out is: what he does for a living, how he came to be
          half-starved on his walking tour&mdash;the doctor said so, you
          remember&mdash;where he was going from and where he is going to when he
          leaves our <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0159" n="142"/> house. In fact, he seems
          to be a very vague and mysterious person, of whom, for a woman of your character
          and peculiar training, you know singularly little." </p>
        <p>Miss Winwood replied that she could not pry into the lad's private affairs. Her
          brother retorted that a youth, in his physically helpless condition, who was
          really ingenuous, would have poured out his life's history into the ears of so
          sympathetic a woman, and have bored her to tears with the inner secrets of his
          soul. </p>
        <p>, He has high aspirations. He has told me of them. But he hasn't bored me a
          bit," said Ursula. </p>
        <p>"What does he aspire to?" </p>
        <p>"What does any brilliant young fellow of two or three and twenty aspire to?
          Anything, everything. He has only to find his path." </p>
        <p>"Yes, but what is his path?" </p>
        <p>"I wish you weren't so much like Uncle Edward, James," said Ursula. </p>
        <p>"He's a damned clever old man," said Colonel Winwood, "and I wish he had stayed
          here long enough to be able to put our young friend through a searching
          cross-examination." </p>
        <p>Ursula lifted her finger-bowl an inch from the doiley and carefully put it down
          again. It was the evening of Colonel Winwood's arrival, and they were lingering
          over coffee in the great, picture-hung and softly lighted dining room. Having
          fixed the bowl in the exact centre of the doiley, she flashed round on her
          brother. "My dear James, do you think I'm an idiot?" </p>
        <p>He took his cigar from his lips and looked at her with not unhumorous dryness.
          "When the world was very young, my dear," said he, "I've no doubt I called you
          so. But not since." <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0160" n="143"/>
        </p>
        <p>She stretched out her hand and tapped his. She was very fond of him. "You can't
          help being a man, my poor boy, and thinking manly thoughts of me, a woman. But
          I'm not an idiot. Our young friend, as you call him, is as poor as a church
          mouse. I know it. No, don't say, 'How?' like Uncle Edward. He hasn't told me,
          but Nurse has&mdash;a heart-breaking history of socks and things. There's
          the doctor's diagnosis, too. I haven't forgotten. But the boy is too proud to
          cry poverty among strangers. He keeps his end up like a man. To hear him talk,
          one would think he not only hadn't a care in the world, but that he commanded
          the earth. How can one help admiring the boy's pluck and&mdash;that's where
          my reticence comes in&mdash;respecting the boy's reserve?" </p>
        <p>"H'm!" said Colonel Winwood. </p>
        <p>"But, good gracious, Jim, dear, supposing you&mdash;or any of
          us&mdash;men, I mean&mdash;had been in this boy's extraordinary
          position&mdash;would you have acted differently? You would have died rather
          than give your poverty away to absolute strangers to whom you were indebted, in
          the way this boy is indebted to us. Good God, jim"&mdash;she sent her
          dessert knife skimming across the table&mdash;"don't you see? Any reference
          to poverty would be an invitation&mdash;a veiled request for further help.
          To a gentleman like Paul Savelli, the thing's unthinkable." </p>
        <p>Colonel Winwood selected a fresh cigar, clipped off the end, and lit it from a
          silver spirit lamp by his side. He blew out the first exquisite
          puff&mdash;the smoker's paradise would be the one first full and fragrant,
          virginal puff of an infinite succession of perfect cigars&mdash;looked
          anxiously at the glowing point to see that it was exactly lighted, and leaned
          back in his chair. </p>
        <p>"What you say, dear," said he, "is plausible. Plausible almost to the point of
          conviction. But there's a <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0161" n="144"/> hole
          somewhere in your argument, I'm sure, and I'm too tired after my journey to find
          it." </p>
        <p>Thus, as the stars in their courses fought against Sisera, so did they fight
          for Paul; and in both cases they used a woman as their instrument. </p>
        <p>Colonel Winwood, in spite of a masculine air of superiority, joined with the
          Archbishops and Cabinet Ministers above referred to in their appreciation of his
          sister's judgment. After all, what business of his were the private affairs of
          his involuntary guest? He paid him a visit the next day, and found him lying on
          a couch by the sunny window, clad in dressing gown and slippers. Paul rose
          politely, though he winced with pain. </p>
        <p>"Don't get up, please. I'm Colonel Winwood." </p>
        <p>They shook hands. Paul began to wheel an armchair from the bedside, but Colonel
          Winwood insisted on his lying down again and drew up the chair himself. "I'm
          afraid," said Paul, "I've been a sad trespasser on your hospitality. Miss
          Winwood must have told you it has scarcely been my fault; but I don't know how
          to express my thanks." </p>
        <p>As Paul made it, the little speech could not have been better. Colonel Winwood,
          who (like the seniors of every age) deplored the lack of manners of the rising
          generation, was pleased by the ever so little elaborate courtesy. </p>
        <p>"I'm only too glad we've pulled you round. You've had a bad time, I hear." </p>
        <p>Paul smiled. "Pretty bad. If it hadn't been for Miss Winwood and all she has
          done for me, I should have pegged out." </p>
        <p>"My sister's a notable woman," said the Colonel. "When she sets out to do a
          thing she does it thoroughly." </p>
        <p>"I owe her my life," said Paul simply. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0162" n="145"
          />
        </p>
        <p>There was a pause. The two men, both bright-eyed, looked at each other for the
          fraction of a second. One, the aristocrat secure of his wealth, of his position,
          of himself, with no illusion left him save pride of birth, no dream save that of
          an England mighty and prosperous under continuous centuries of Tory rule, no
          memories but of stainless honour&mdash;he had fought gallantly for his
          Queen, he had lived like a noble gentleman, he had done his country
          disinterested service&mdash;no ambition but to keep himself on the level of
          the ideal which he had long since attained; the other the creation of nothing
          but of dreams, the child of the gutter, the adventurer, the vagabond, with no
          address, not even a back room over a sweetstuff shop in wide England, the
          possessor of a few suits of old clothes and one pound, one shilling and a penny,
          with nothing in front of him but the vast blankness of 'life, nothing behind him
          save memories of sordid struggle, with nothing to guide him, nothing to set him
          on his way with thrilling pulse and quivering fibres save the Vision Splendid,
          the glorious Hope, the unconquerable Faith. In the older man's eyes Paul read
          the calm, stern certainty of things both born to and achieved; and Colonel
          Winwood saw in the young man's eyes, as in a glass darkly, the reflection of the
          Vision. </p>
        <p>"And yours is a very young life," said he. "Gad! it must be wonderful to be
          twenty. 'Rich in the glory of my rising sun.' You know your Thackeray?" </p>
        <p>" '<hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">Riche de ma jeunesse</foreign>
          </hi>,' " laughed Paul. "Thackeray went one better than B&eacute;ranger,
          that time." </p>
        <p>"I forgot," said Colonel Winwood. "My sister told me. You go about with
          B&eacute;ranger as a sort of pocket Bible." </p>
        <p>Paul laughed again. "When one is on the tramp one's choice of books is limited
          by their cubical con- <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0163" n="146"/> tent. One
          couldn't take Gibbon, for instance, or a complete Balzac." </p>
        <p>Colonel Winwood tugged at his drooping moustache and again scrutinized the
          frank and exceedingly attractive youth. His astonishing perfection of feature
          was obvious to anybody. Yet any inconsiderable human&mdash;a peasant of the
          Campagna, a Venetian gondolier, a swaggering brigand of
          Macedonia&mdash;could be astonishingly beautiful. And, being astonishingly
          beautiful, that was the beginning and end of him. But behind this merely
          physical attractiveness of his guest glowed a lambent intelligence, quick as
          lightning. There was humorous challenge in those laughing and lucent dark eyes. </p>
        <p>"Do you know your Balzac?" he asked. </p>
        <p>"Oh, yes," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"I wonder if you do," said Colonel Winwood. "I'm rather a Balzacian myself." </p>
        <p>"I can't say I've read all Balzac. That's a colossal order," said Paul, rather
          excited-for, in his limited acquaintance with cultivated folk, Colonel Winwood
          was the only human being who could claim acquaintance with one of the literary
          gods of his idolatry&mdash;"but I know him pretty well. I can't stand his
          'Th&#x00E9;&#x00E2;tre'&mdash;that's footle-but the big
          things&mdash;'Le P&#x00E8;re Goriot,' 'La Cousine Bette,'
          'C&#x00E9;sar Birotteau'&mdash;what a great book 'C&#x00E9;sar
          Birotteau' is!&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"You're right," said Colonel Winwood, forgetful of any possible barriers
          between himself and the young enthusiast. "It's one of the four or five great
          books, and very few people recognize it." </p>
        <p>"'Le Lys dans la Vall&#x00E9;e,'" said Paul. </p>
        <p>"There's another&mdash;" </p>
        <p>And they talked for half an hour of the Baron Nucingen, and Rastignac, and
          Hulot, and Bixiou, and Lousteau, and Gobsec, and Gaudissart, and Vautrin, <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0164" n="147"/> and many another vivid personage in the
          human comedy. </p>
        <p>"That man could have gone on writing for a hundred years," cried Paul, "and he
          could have exhausted all the possibilities of human life." </p>
        <p>Colonel Winwood smiled courteously. "We have a bond in Balzac," said he. "But I
          must go. My sister said I mustn't tire you." He rose. "We're having a lot of
          people down here this week for the shooting. There'll be good sport. Pity you're
          not well enough to join us." </p>
        <p>Paul smiled. He had one of his flashes of tact, "I'm afraid," said he modestly,
          "that I've never fired off a gun in my life." </p>
        <p>"What?" cried the Colonel. </p>
        <p>"It's true." </p>
        <p>Colonel Winwood looked at him once more. "It's not many young men," said he,
          "who would dare to make such a confession." </p>
        <p>"But what is the good of lying?" asked Paul, with the eyes of a cherub. </p>
        <p>"None that I know of," replied the Colonel. He returned to his chair and rested
          his hand on the back. "You play golf, anyhow," said he, pointing to the brown
          canvas bag in the corner. </p>
        <p>"Oh, yes," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Any good?" </p>
        <p>"Fair to middling." </p>
        <p>"What's your handicap?" asked the Colonel, an enthusiastic though inglorious
          practitioner of the game. </p>
        <p>"One," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"The deuce it is!" cried the Colonel. "Mine is fifteen. You must give me a
          lesson or two when you pull round. We've a capital course here." </p>
        <p>"That's very kind of you," said Paul, "but I'm <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0165"
            n="148"/> afraid I shall be well enough for ordinary purposes long before I'm
          able to handle a golf club." </p>
        <p>"What do you mean?" </p>
        <p>"This silly pleurisy. It will hang about for ages!" </p>
        <p>"Well?" </p>
        <p>"I'll have to go my ways from here long before I can play." </p>
        <p>"Any great hurry?" </p>
        <p>"I can't go on accepting your wonderful hospitality indefinitely," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"That's nonsense. Stay as long as ever you like." </p>
        <p>"If I did that," said Paul, "I would stay on forever. " </p>
        <p>The Colonel smiled and shook hands with him. In the ordinary way of social life
          this was quite an unnecessary thing to do. But he acted according to the
          impulses common to a thousand of his type&mdash;and a fine type&mdash;in
          England. Setting aside the mere romantic exterior of a Macedonian brigand, here
          was a young man of the period with astonishingly courteous manners,
          of&mdash;and this was of secondary consideration&mdash;of frank and
          winning charm, with a free-and-easy intimacy with Balzac, of fearless
          truthfulness regarding his deficiencies, and with a golf handicap of one. The
          Colonel's hand and heart went out in instinctive co&oelig;rdination. The
          Colonel Winwoods of this country are not gods; they are very humanly fallible;
          but of such is the Kingdom of England. </p>
        <p>"At any rate," said he, "you mustn't dream of leaving us yet." </p>
        <p>He went downstairs and met his sister in the hall. </p>
        <p>"Well?" she asked, with just a gleam of quizzicality in her eyes, for she knew
          whence he had come. </p>
        <p>"One of these days I'll take him out and teach him to shoot," said the
          Colonel.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER X</head>

        <p>THE shooting party came, and Paul, able to leave his room and sit in the
          sunshine and crawl about the lawn and come down to dinner, though early
          retirement was prescribed, went among the strange men and women of the
          aristocratic caste like one in a dream of bliss. Much of their talk, sport and
          personalities, was unintelligible; every man seemed to have killed everything
          everywhere and every woman seemed to know everybody and everybody's intimate
          secrets. So when conversation was general, Paul, who had killed nothing and knew
          nobody, listened in silent perplexity. But even the perplexity was a happiness.
          It was all so new, so fascinating. For was not this world of
          aristocrats&mdash;there were lords and ladies and great personages whose
          names he had read in the newspapers&mdash;his rightful inheritance, the
          sphere to which he had been born? And they did not always talk of things which
          he did not understand. They received him among them with kind welcome and
          courtesy. No one asked him whence he came and whither he was going. They took
          him for granted, as a guest of the Winwoods. Of course if Paul had seen himself
          on the way to rival the famous actor whose photograph in the window of the
          London Stereoscopic Company had inspired him with histrionic ambitions, he would
          have been at no pains to hide his profession. But between the darling of the
          London stage and a seedy member of a fit-up company lies a great gulf. He shrank
          from <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0167" n="150"/> being associated with Mr.
          Vincent Crummles. One thing, however, of invaluable use he had brought with him
          from Theatreland&mdash;the dress suit which formed part of his stage
          wardrobe. There were other things, too, which he did not
          appreciate&mdash;ease of manner, victory over the lingering Lancastrian
          burr, and a knowledge of what to do with his feet and hands. </p>
        <p>One day he had a great shock. The house party were assembling in the
          drawing-room, when in sailed the great lady, the ever-memorable great lady, the
          Marchioness of Chudley, who had spoken to him and smiled on him in the Bludston
          factory. Fear laid a cold grip on his heart. He thought of pleading weakness and
          running away to the safe obscurity of his room. But it was too late. The
          procession was formed immediately, and he found himself in his place with his
          partner on his arm. Dinner was torture. What he said to his neighbours he knew
          not. He dared not look up the table where Lady Chudley sat in full view. Every
          moment he expected&mdash;ridiculous apprehension of an accusing
          conscience&mdash;Colonel Winwood to come and tap him on the shoulder and bid
          him begone. But nothing happened. Afterwards, in the drawing-room, Fate drove
          him into a corner near Lady Chudley, whose eyes he met clear upon him. He turned
          away hurriedly and plunged into conversation with a young soldier standing by.
          Presently he heard Miss Winwood's voice. </p>
        <p>"Mr. Savelli, I want to introduce you to Lady Chudley." </p>
        <p>The fear gripped him harder and colder. How could he explain that he was
          occupying his rightful place in that drawing-room? But he held himself up and
          resolved to face the peril like a man. Lady Chudley smiled on him
          graciously&mdash;how well he remembered her smile!&mdash;and made him
          sit by her side. She <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0168" n="151"/> was a dark,
          stately woman of forty, giving the impression that she could look confoundedly
          cold and majestic when she chose. She wore diamonds in her hair and a broad
          diamond clasp to the black velvet round her throat. </p>
        <p>"Miss Winwood has been telling me what an awful time you've had, Mr. Savelli,"
          she said pleasantly. "Now, whenever I hear of people having had pneumonia I
          always want to talk to them and sympathize with them." </p>
        <p>"That's very kind of you, Lady Chudley," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Only a fellow-feeling. I nearly died of it once myself. I hope you're getting
          strong." </p>
        <p>"I'm feeling my strength returning every day. It's a queer new joy." </p>
        <p>"Isn't it?" </p>
        <p>They discussed the exhilaration of convalescence. It was a 'wonderful
          springtide. They reverted to the preceding misery. </p>
        <p>"You're far luckier than I was," she remarked. "You've had a comfy English
          house to be ill in. I was in a stone-cold palazzo in Florence&mdash;in
          winter. Ugh! Shall I ever forget it? I don't want to speak evil of Italy to an
          Italian&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"I'm only Italian by descent," exclaimed Paul, with a laugh, his first frank
          laugh during the whole of that gloomy evening. And he laughed louder than was
          necessary, for, as it suddenly dawned upon him that he did not in the least
          recall to her mind the grimy little Bludston boy, the cold hand of fear was
          dissolved in a warm gush of exultation. "You can abuse Italy or any country but
          England as much as you like." </p>
        <p>"Why mustn't I abuse England?" </p>
        <p>"Because it's the noblest country in the world," he <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0169" n="152"/> cried; and, seeing approval in her
          eyes, he yielded to an odd temptation. "If one could only do something great for
          her!" </p>
        <p>"What would you like to do?" she asked. </p>
        <p>"Anything. Sing for her. Work for her. Die for her. It makes one so impatient
          to sit down and do nothing. If one could only stir her up to a sense of her
          nationality!" he went on, less lyrically, though with the same fine enthusiasm.
          "She seems to be losing it, letting the smaller nations assert theirs to such an
          extent that she is running the risk of becoming a mere geographical expression.
          She has merged herself in the Imperial Ideal. That's magnificent; but the Empire
          ought to realize her as the great Motherheart. If England could only wake up as
          England again, what a wonderful thing it would be!" </p>
        <p>"It would," said Lady Chudley. "And you would like to be the awakener?" </p>
        <p>"Ay!" said Paul&mdash;"what a dream!" </p>
        <p>"There was never a dream worth calling a dream that did not come true." </p>
        <p>"Do you believe that, too?" he asked delightedly. "I've held to it all my
          life." </p>
        <p>Colonel Winwood, who had been moving hostwise from group to group in the great
          drawing-room, where already a couple of bridge tables had been arranged,
          approached slowly. Lady Chudley gave him a laughing glance of dismissal. Paul's
          spacious Elizabethan patriotism, rare&mdash;at least in
          expression&mdash;among the young men of the day, interested and amused her. </p>
        <p>"Have you dreamed all your life of being the Awakener of England?" </p>
        <p>"I have dreamed of being so many things," he said, anxious not to commit
          himself. For, truth to say, this new ambition was but a couple of minutes old.
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0170" n="153"/>
        </p>
        <p>It had sprung into life, however, like Pallas Athene, all armed and equipped. </p>
        <p>"And they have all come true?" </p>
        <p>His great eyes laughed and his curly head bent ever so slightly. "Those worth
          calling dreams," said he. </p>
        <p>A little later in the evening, when on retiring to an early bed he was wishing
          Miss Winwood good night, she said, "You're a lucky young man." </p>
        <p>"I know&mdash;but&mdash;" He looked smiling inquiry. </p>
        <p>"Lady Chudley's the most valuable woman in England for a young man to get on
          the right side of." </p>
        <p>Paul went to bed dazed. The great lady who had recognized the divine fire in
          the factory boy had again recognized it in the grown man. She had all but said
          that, if he chose, he could be the Awakener of England. The Awakener of England!
          The watchword of his new-born ambition rang in his brain until he fell asleep. </p>
        <p>The time soon came when the prospective Awakener of England awoke to the fact
          that he must fare forth into the sleeping land with but a guinea in his pocket.
          The future did not dismay him, for he knew now that his dreams came true. But he
          was terribly anxious, more anxious than ever, to leave Drane's Court with all
          the prestige of the prospective Awakener. Now, this final scene of the
          production could not be worked for a guinea. There were golden tips to servants,
          there was the first-class railway fare. Once in London&mdash;he could pawn
          things to keep him going, and a Bloomsbury landlady with whom he had lodged,
          since the loss of Jane, would give him a fortnight or three weeks' credit. But
          he had to get to London-to get there gloriously; so that when the turn of
          Fortune's wheel enabled him to seek again these won- <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0171" n="154"/> derful friends in the aristocratic
          sphere to which he belonged, he could come among them untarnished, the
          conquering prince. But that miserable guinea! He racked his brains. There was
          his gold watch and chain, a symbol, to his young mind, of high estate. When he
          had bought it there crossed his mind the silly thought of its signification of
          the infinite leagues that lay between him and Billy Goodge. He could pawn it for
          ten pounds&mdash;it would be like pawning his heart's blood&mdash;but
          where? Not in Morebury, even supposing there was a pawnbroker's in the place. He
          had many friends in his profession, scattered up and down the land. But he had
          created round himself the atmosphere of the young magnifico. It was he who had
          lent, others who had borrowed. Rothschild or Rockefeller inviting any of them to
          lend him money would have produced less jaw-dropping amazement. Even if he sent
          his pride flying and appealed to the most friendly and generous, he shrank from
          the sacrifice he would call upon the poor devil to make. There was only his
          beautiful and symbolic watch and chain. The nearest great town where he could be
          sure of finding a pawnbroker was distant an hour's train journey. </p>
        <p>So on the day before that for which, in spite of hospitable protestations on
          the part of Colonel and Miss Winwood, he had fixed his departure, he set forth
          on the plea of private business, and returned with a heavier pocket and a
          heavier heart. He had been so proud, poor boy, of the gold insignia across his
          stomach. He had had a habit of fingering it lovingly. Now it was gone. He felt
          naked&mdash;in a curious way dishonoured. There only remained his cornelian
          talisman. He got back in time for tea and kept his jacket closely buttoned. But
          in the evening he had perforce to appear stark and ungirt&mdash;in those
          days Fashion had <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0172" n="155"/> not yet decreed, as
          it does now, the absence of watchchain on evening dress&mdash;and Paul
          shambled into the drawing-room like a guest without a wedding garment. There
          were still a few people staying in the house&mdash;the shooting party
          proper, and Lady Chudley, had long since gone&mdash;but enough remained to
          be a social microcosm for Paul. Every eye was upon him. In spite of himself, his
          accusing hand went fingering the inanity of his waistcoat front. He also
          fingered, with a horrible fascination, the dirty piece of card that took the
          place of his watch in his pocket. </p>
        <p>One must be twenty to realize the tragedy of it. <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">Dans un grenier qu'on est bien &#x00E0; vingt
              ans!</foreign>
          </hi> To be twenty, in a garret, with the freedom and the joy of it! Yes; the
          dear poet was right. In those "brave days" the poignancy of life comes not in
          the garret, but in the palace. </p>
        <p>To-morrow, with his jacket buttoned, he could make his exit from Drane's Court
          in the desired splendour&mdash;scattering largesse to menials and showing to
          hosts the reflected glow of the golden prospects before him; but for this
          evening the glory had departed. Besides, it was his last evening there, and
          London's welcome tomorrow would be none too exuberant. </p>
        <p>The little party was breaking up, the ladies retiring for the night, and the
          men about to accompany Colonel Winwood to the library for a final drink and
          cigarette. Paul shook hands with Miss Winwood. </p>
        <p>"Good night&mdash;and good-bye," she said, "if you take the early train.
          But must you really go to-morrow?" </p>
        <p>"I must," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"I hope we'll very soon be seeing you again. Give me your address." She moved
          to a bridge table and caught up the marking block, which she brought to him.
          "Now I've forgotten the pencil." </p>
        <p>"I've got one," said Paul, and impulsively thrust- <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0173" n="156"/> ing his fingers into his waistcoat
          pocket, flicked them out with the pencil. But he also flicked out the
          mean-looking card of which he had been hatefully conscious all the evening. The
          Imp of Mischance arranged that as Miss Winwood stood close by his side, it
          should fall, unperceived by him, on the folds of her grey velvet train. He wrote
          the Bloomsbury address and handed her the leaf torn from the pad. She folded it
          up, moved away, turning back to smile. As she turned she happened to look
          downward; then she stooped and picked the card from her dress. A conjecture of
          horror smote Paul. He made a step forward and stretched out his hand; but not
          before she had instinctively glanced first at the writing and then at his barren
          waistcoat. She repressed a slight gasp, regarding him with steady, searching
          eyes. </p>
        <p>His dark face flushed crimson as he took the accursed thing, desiring no
          greater boon from Heaven than instant death. He felt sick with humiliation. The
          brightly lit room grew black. It was in a stupor of despair that he heard her
          say, "Wait a bit here, till I've got rid of these people." </p>
        <p>He stumbled away and stood on the bearskin rug before the fireplace, while she
          joined the lingering group by the door. The two or three minutes were an
          eternity of agony to Paul. He had lost his great game. </p>
        <p>Miss Winwood shut the door and came swiftly to him and laid her hand on his
          arm. Paul hung his head and looked into the fire. "My poor boy!" she said very
          tenderly. "What are you going to do with yourself ?" </p>
        <p>If it had not been for the diabolical irony of the mishap he would have
          answered with his gay flourish. But now he could not so answer. Boyish, hateful
          tears stood in his eyes and, in spite of anguished <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0174" n="157"/> effort of will, threatened to fall. He
          continued to look into the fire, so that she should not see them. "I shall go on
          as I always have done," he said as stoutly as he could. </p>
        <p>"Your prospects are not very bright, I fear." </p>
        <p>"I shall keep my head above water," said Paul. "Oh, please don't!" he cried,
          shivering. "You have been so good to me. I can't bear you to have seen that
          thing. I can't stand it." </p>
        <p>"My dear boy," she said, coming a little nearer, "I don't think the worse of
          you for that. On the contrary, I admire your pluck and your brave attitude
          towards life. Indeed I do. I respect you for it. Do you remember the old Italian
          story of Ser Federigo and his falcon? How he hid his poverty like a knightly
          gentleman? You see what I mean, don't you? You mustn't be angry with me!" </p>
        <p>Her words were Gilead balm of instantaneous healing. </p>
        <p>"Angry?" </p>
        <p>His voice quavered. In a revulsion of emotion he turned blindly, seized her
          hand and kissed it. It was all he could do. </p>
        <p>"If I have found it out&mdash;not just now," she quickly interjected,
          seeing him wince, "but long ago&mdash;it was not your fault. You've made a
          gallant gentleman's show to the end&mdash;until I come, in a perfectly
          brutal way, and try to upset it. Tell me&mdash;I'm old enough to be your
          mother, and you must know by this time that I'm your friend&mdash;have you
          any resources at all&mdash;beyond&mdash;?" She made ever so slight a
          motion of her hand toward the hidden pawn ticket. </p>
        <p>"No," said Paul, with his sure tact and swiftly working imagination. "I had
          just come to an end of them. It's a silly story of losses and
          what-not&mdash;I needn't bother you with it. I thought I would walk <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0175" n="158"/> to London, with the traditional
          half-crown in my pocket"&mdash;he flashed a wistful smile&mdash;"and
          seek my fortune. But I fell ill at your gates." </p>
        <p>"And now that you're restored to health, you propose in the same debonair
          fashion to&mdash;well&mdash;to resume the search?" </p>
        <p>"Of course," said Paul, all the fighting and aristocratic instincts returning.
          "Why not?" </p>
        <p>There were no tears in his eyes now, and they looked with luminous fearlessness
          at Miss Winwood. He drew a chair to the edge of the bearskin. "Won't you sit
          down, Miss Winwood?" </p>
        <p>She accepted the seat. He sat down too. Before replying she played with her fan
          rather roughly&mdash;more or less as a man might have played with it. "What
          do you think of doing?" </p>
        <p>"Journalism," said Paul. He had indeed thought of it. </p>
        <p>"Have you any opening?" </p>
        <p>"None," he laughed. "But that's the oyster I'm going to open." </p>
        <p>Miss Winwood took a cigarette from a silver box near by. Paul sprang to light
          it. She inhaled in silence half a dozen puffs. "I'm going to ask you an
          outrageous question," she said, at last. "In the first place, I'm a severely
          business woman, and in the next I've got an uncle and a brother with
          cross-examining instincts, and, though I loathe them&mdash;the instincts, I
          mean&mdash;I can't get away from them. We're down on the bedrock of things,
          you and I. Will you tell me, straight, why you went away to-day
          to&mdash;to"&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"to pawn your watch and
          chain, instead of waiting till you got to London?" </p>
        <p>Paul threw out his arms in a wide gesture. "Why&mdash;your
          servants&mdash;" </p>
        <p>She cast the just lighted cigarette into the fire, <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0176" n="159"/> rose and clapped her hands on his
          shoulders, her face aflame. "Forgive me&mdash;I knew it&mdash;there are
          doubting Thomases everywhere&mdash;and I'm a woman who deals with facts, so
          that I can use them to the confusion of enemies. Now I have them. Ser Federigo's
          watch and chain. <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="de">Nicht wahr</foreign>
          </hi>?" </p>
        <p>Remember, you who judge this sensible woman of forty-three, that she had fallen
          in love with Paul in the most unreprehensible way in the world; and if a woman
          of that age cannot fall in love with a boy sweetly motherwise, what is the good
          of her? She longed to prove that her polyhedral crystal of a paragon radiated
          pure light from every one of his innumerable facets. It was a matter of intense
          joy to turn him round and find each facet pure. There was also much pity in her
          heart, such as a woman might feel for a wounded bird which she had picked up and
          nursed in her bosom and healed. Ursula was loath to let her bird fly forth into
          the bleak winter. </p>
        <p>"My brother and I have been talking about you&mdash;he is your friend,
          too," she said, resuming her seat. "How would it suit you to stay with us
          altogether?" </p>
        <p>Paul started bolt upright in his chair. "What do you mean?" he asked
          breathlessly, for the heavens had opened with dazzling unexpectedness. </p>
        <p>"In some such position as confidential secretary&mdash;at a decent salary,
          of course. We've not been able to find a suitable man since Mr. Kinghorne left
          us in the spring. He got into Parliament, you know, for Reddington at the
          by-election&mdash;and we've been muddling along with honorary secretaries
          and typists. I shouldn't suggest it to you," she went on, so as to give him time
          to think, for he sat staring at her, openmouthed, bewildered, his breath coming
          quickly&mdash;"I shouldn't suggest it to you if there were no chances for
          you in it. You would be in the thick of public <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0177"
            n="160"/> affairs, and an ambitious man might find a path in them that would
          lead him anywhere. I've had the idea in my head," she smiled, "for-some time.
          But I've only spoken to my brother about it this afternoon&mdash;he has been
          so busy, you see&mdash;and I intended to have another talk with him, so as
          to crystallize things&mdash;duties, money, and so forth&mdash;before
          making you any proposal. I was going to write to you with everything cut and
          dried. But"&mdash;she hesitated delicately&mdash;"I'm glad I didn't.
          It's so much more simple and friendly to talk. Now, what do you say?" </p>
        <p>Paul rose and gripped his hands together and looked again into the fire. "What
          can I say? I could only go on my knees to you&mdash;and that&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"That would be beautifully romantic and entirely absurd," she laughed. "Anyhow,
          it's settled. Tomorrow we can discuss details." She rose and put out her hand.
          "Good night, Paul." </p>
        <p>He bowed low. "My dearest lady," said he in a low voice, and went and held the
          door open for her to pass out. </p>
        <p>Then he flung up his arms wildly and laughed aloud and strode about the room in
          exultation. All he had hoped for and worked for was an exit of fantastic and
          barren glory. After which, the Deluge&mdash;anything. He had never dreamed
          of this sudden blaze of Fortune. Now, indeed, did the Great Things to which he
          was born lie to his hand. Queerly but surely Destiny was guiding him upward. In
          every way Chance had worked for him. His poverty had been a cloak of honour; the
          thrice-blessed pawn ticket a patent of nobility. His kingdom lay before him, its
          purple mountains looming through the mists of dawn. And he would enter into it
          as the Awakener of England. He stood thrilled. The ambition was no longer the
          wild dream of yesterday. From the heart of the great <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0178" n="161"/> affairs in which he would have his
          being he could pluck his awakening instrument. The world seemed suddenly to
          become real. And in the midst of it was this wonderful, beautiful, dearest lady
          with her keen insight, her delicate sympathy, her warm humanity. With some
          extravagance he consecrated himself to her service. </p>
        <p>After a while he sat down soberly and took from his pocket the cornelian heart
          which his first goddess had given him twelve years ago. What had become of her?
          He did not even know her name. But what happiness, he thought, to meet her in
          the plenitude of his greatness and show her the heart, and say, "I owe it all to
          you!" To her alone of mortals would he reveal himself. </p>
        <p>And then he thought of Barney Bill, who had helped him on his way; of Rowlatt,
          good fellow, who was dead; and of Jane, whom he had lost. He wished he could
          write to Jane and tell her the wonderful news. She would understand. . . . Well,
          well! It was time for bed. He rose and switched off the lights and went to his
          room. But as he walked through the great, noiseless house, he felt, in spite of
          Fortune's bounty, a loneliness of soul; also irritation at having lost Jane.
          What a letter he could have written to her! He could not say the things with
          which his heart was bursting to anyone on earth but Jane. Why had he lost Jane?
          The prospective Awakener of England wanted Jane.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XI</head>

        <p>ONE morning Paul, with a clump of papers in his hand, entered his pleasant
          private room at Drane's Court, stepped briskly to the long Cromwellian table
          placed in the window bay, and sat down to his correspondence. </p>
        <p>It was gusty outside, as could be perceived by the shower of yellow beech
          leaves that slanted across the view; but indoors a great fire flaming up the
          chimney, a Turkey carpet fading into beauty, rich eighteenth century mezzotints
          on the walls, reposeful leather-covered chairs and a comfortable bookcase gave
          an atmosphere of warmth and coziness. Paul lit a cigarette and attacked a pile
          of unopened letters. At last he came to an envelope, thick and faintly scented,
          bearing a crown on the flap. He opened it and read: </p>
        <p> DEAR MR. SAVELLI: </p>
        <p>Will you dine on Saturday and help me entertain an eminent Egyptologist? I know
          nothing of Egypt save Shepheard's Hotel, and that I'm afraid wouldn't interest
          him. Do come to my rescue. Yours,<lb/> SOPHIE ZOBRASKA. </p>
        <p>Paul leaned back in his chair, twiddling the letter between his fingers, and
          looked smilingly out or, the grey autumn rack of clouds. There was a pleasant
          and flattering intimacy in the invitation: pleasant because it came from a
          pretty woman; flattering because the woman was a princess, widow of a younger
          son <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0180" n="163"/> of a Royal Balkan house. She
          lived at Chetwood. Park, on the other side of Morebury, and was one of the great
          ones of those latitudes. A real princess. </p>
        <p>Paul's glance, travelling back from the sky, fell upon the brass date indicator
          on the table. It marked the 2nd of October. On that day five years ago he had.
          entered on his duties at Drane's Court. He laughed softly. Five years ago be was
          a homeless wanderer. Now princesses were begging him to rescue them from
          Egyptologists. With glorious sureness all his dreams were coming true. </p>
        <p>Thus we see our Fortunate Youth at eight-and-twenty in the heyday of success.
          If he had strutted about under Jane's admiring eyes, like a peacock among daws,
          he now walked serene, a peacock among peacocks. He wore the raiment, frequented
          the clubs, ate the dinners of the undeservingly rich and the deservingly great.
          His charm and his self-confidence, which a genius of tact saved from
          self-assertion, carried him pleasantly through the social world; his sympathetic
          intelligence dealt largely and strongly with the public affairs under his
          control. He loved organizing, persuading, casting skilful nets. His appeal for
          subscriptions was irresistible. He had the magical gift of wringing a hundred
          pounds from a plutocrat with the air of conferring a graceful favour. In aid of
          the Mission to Convert the Jews he could have fleeced a synagogue. The societies
          and institutions in which the Colonel and Ursula Winwood were interested
          flourished amazingly beneath his touch. The Girls' Club in the Isle of Dogs,
          long since abandoned in despair by the young Guardsman, grew into a popular and
          sweetly mannered nunnery. The Central London Home" for the Indigent Blind, which
          had been languishing for support, in spite of Miss Winwood's <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0181" n="164"/> efforts, found itself now in a position
          to build a much-needed wing. There was also, most wonderful and, important thing
          of all, the Young England League, which was covering him with steadily
          increasing glory. Of this much hereafter. But it must be remembered. Ursula
          complained that he left her nothing to do save attend dreary committee meetings;
          and even for these Paul saved her all the trouble in hunting up information. She
          was a mere figurehead. </p>
        <p>"Dearest lady," Paul would say, "if you send me about my business, you'll write
          me a character, won't you, saying that you're dismissing me for incorrigible
          efficiency?" </p>
        <p>"You know perfectly well," she would sigh, "that I would be a lost, lone woman
          without you." </p>
        <p>Whereat Paul would laugh his gay laugh. At this period of his life he had not a
          care in the world. </p>
        <p>The game of politics also fascinated him. A year or so after he joined the
          Winwoods there was a General Election. The Liberals, desiring to drive the old
          Tory from his lair, sent down a strong candidate to Morebury. There was a fierce
          battle, into which Paul threw himself, heart and soul. He discovered he could
          speak. When he first found himself holding a couple of hundred villagers in the
          grip of his impassioned utterance he felt that the awakening of England had
          begun. It was a delicious moment. As a canvasser he performed prodigies of
          cajolery. Extensive paper mills, a hotbed of raging Socialism, according to
          Colonel Winwood, defaced (in the Colonel's eyes) the outskirts of the little
          town. </p>
        <p>"They're wrong 'uns to a man," said the Colonel, despondently. </p>
        <p>Paul came back from among them with a notebook full of promises. </p>
        <p>"How did you manage it?" asked the Colonel. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0182"
            n="165"/>
        </p>
        <p>"I think I got on to the poetical side of politics," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"What the deuce is that?" </p>
        <p>Paul smiled. "An appeal to the imagination," said he. </p>
        <p>When Colonel Winwood got in by an increased majority, in spite of the wave of
          Liberalism that spread over the land, he gave Paul a gold cigarette case; and
          thenceforward admitted him into his political confidence. So Paul became
          familiar with the Lobby of the House of Commons and with the subjects before the
          Committees on which Colonel Winwood sat, and with the delicate arts of
          wire-pulling and intrigue, which appeared to him a monstrously fine diversion.
          There was also the matter of Colonel Winwood's speeches, which the methodical
          warrior wrote out laboriously beforehand and learned by heart. They were sound,
          weighty pronouncements, to which the House listened with respect; but they
          lacked the flashes which lit enthusiasm. One day he threw the bundle of
          typescript across to Paul. </p>
        <p>"See what you think of that." </p>
        <p>Paul saw and made daring pencilled amendments, and took it to the Colonel. </p>
        <p>"It's all very funny," said the latter, tugging his drooping moustache, "but I
          can't say things like that in the House." </p>
        <p>"Why not?" asked Paul. </p>
        <p>."If they heard me make an epigram, they would have a fit." </p>
        <p>"Our side wouldn't. The Government might. The Government ought to have fits all
          the time until it expires in convulsions." </p>
        <p>"But this is a mere dull agricultural question. The Board of Agriculture have
          brought it in, and it's such pernicious nonsense that I, as a county gentleman,
          have to speak against it." <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0183" n="166"/>
        </p>
        <p>"But couldn't you stick in my little joke about the pigs?" asked Paul
          pleadingly. </p>
        <p>"What's that?" Colonel Winwood found the place in the script. "I say that the
          danger of swine fever arising from this clause in the Bill will affect every
          farmer in England." </p>
        <p>"And I say," cried Paul eagerly, pointing to his note, "if this clause becomes
          law, swine fever will rage through the land like a demoniacal possession. The
          myriad pigs of Great Britain, possessed of the, devils of Socialism, will be
          turned into Gadarene swine hurtling down to destruction. You can show how they
          hurtle, like this&mdash;" He flickered his bands. "Do try it." </p>
        <p>"H'm!" said Colonel Winwood. </p>
        <p>Sorely against his will, he tried it. To his astonishment it was a success. The
          House of Commons, like Mr. Peter Magnus's friend, is easily amused. The
          exaggeration gave a cannon-ball's weight to his sound argument. The Government
          dropped the clause&mdash;it was only a trivial part of a wide-reaching
          measure&mdash;the President of the Board of Agriculture saying gracefully
          that in the miracle he hoped to bring about he had unfortunately forgotten the
          effect it might have on the pigs. There was "renewed laughter," but Colonel
          Winwood remained the hero of the half-hour and received the ecstatic
          congratulations of unhumorous friends. He might have defeated the Government
          altogether. In the daily round of political life nothing is so remarkable as the
          lack of sense of proportion. </p>
        <p>"It was the Gadarene swine that did it," they said. </p>
        <p>"And that," said Colonel Winwood honestly, " was my young devil of a
          secretary." </p>
        <p>Thenceforward the young wit and the fresh fancy of Paul played like a fountain
          over Colonel Winwood's and speeches. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0184" n="167"/>
        </p>
        <p>"Look here, young man," said he one day, "I don't like it. Sometimes I take
          your confounded suggestions, because they happen to fit in; but I'm actually
          getting the reputation of a light political comedian, and it won't do." </p>
        <p>Whereupon Paul, with his swift intuition, saw that in the case of a proud,
          earnest gentleman like Colonel Winwood the tempting emendations of typescript
          would not do. In what Miss Winwood called his subtle Italian way, he induced his
          patron to discuss the speeches before the process of composition. These
          discussions, involving the swift rapier play of intelligences, Colonel Winwood
          enjoyed. They stimulated him magically. He sat down and wrote his speeches,
          delightfully unconscious of what in them was Paul and what was himself; and when
          he delivered them he was proud of the impression he had made upon the House. </p>
        <p>And so, as the years passed, Paul gained influence not only in the little
          circle of Drane's Court and Portland Place, but also in the outer world. He was
          a young man of some note. His name appeared occasionally in the newspapers, both
          in connection with the Winwood charities and with the political machine of the
          Unionist party. He was welcomed at London dinner tables and in country houses.
          He was a young man who would go far. For the rest, he had learned to ride and
          shoot, and not to make mistakes about the genealogical relationships of
          important families. He had travelled about Europe, sometimes with the Winwoods,
          sometimes by himself. He was a young man of cultivation and accomplishment. </p>
        <p>On this fifth anniversary he sat gazing unseeingly at the autumn rack, the
          Princess's letter in his band, and letting his thoughts wander down the years.
          He <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0185" n="168"/> marvelled how valiantly the stars
          in their courses had fought for him. Even against recognition his life was
          charmed. Once, indeed, he met at the house in Portland Place a painter to whom
          he had posed. The painter looked at him keenly. </p>
        <p>"Surely we have met before?" </p>
        <p>"We have," said Paul with daring frankness. "I remember it gratefully. But if
          you would forget it I should be still more grateful." </p>
        <p>The painter shook hands with him and smiled. "You may be sure I haven't the
          least idea what you're talking about." </p>
        <p>As for Theatreland, the lower walks in the profession to which Paul had
          belonged do not cross the paths of high political society. It lay behind him far
          and forgotten. His position was secure. Here and there an anxious mother may
          have been worried as to his precise antecedents; but Paul was too astute to give
          mothers over-much cause for anxiety. lie lived under the fascination of the
          Great Game. When he came into his kingdom he could choose; not before. His
          destiny was drawing him nearer and nearer to it, he thought, with slow and
          irresistible force. In a few years there would be Parliament, office, power, the
          awaking from stupor of an England hypnotized by malign influences. He saw
          himself at the table in the now familiar House of green benches, thundering out
          an Empire's salvation. If he thought more of the awakener than the awakening, it
          was because be was the same little Paul Kegworthy to whom the cornelian heart
          had brought the Vision Splendid in the scullery of the Bludston slum. The
          cornelian heart still lay in his waistcoat pocket at the end of his watch chain.
          He also held a real princess's letter in his hand. </p>
        <p>A tap at the door aroused him from his day-dream. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0186" n="169"/>
        </p>
        <p>There entered a self-effacing young woman with pencil and notebook. "Are you
          ready for me, sir ?" </p>
        <p>"Not quite. Sit down for a minute, Miss Smithers. Or, come up to the table if
          you don't mind, and help me open these envelopes." </p>
        <p>Paul, you see, was a great man, who commanded the services of a shorthand
          typist. </p>
        <p>To the mass of correspondence then opened and read he added that which he had
          brought in from Colonel and Miss Winwood. From this he sorted the few letters
          which it would be necessary to answer in his own handwriting, and laid them
          aside; then taking the great bulk, he planted himself on the hearthrug, with his
          back to the fire, and, cigarette in mouth, dictated to the self-effacing young
          woman. She took down his words with anxious humility, for she looked upon him as
          a god sphered on Olympian heights&mdash;and what socially insecure young
          woman of lower-middle-class England could do otherwise in the presence of a
          torturingly beautiful youth, immaculately raimented, who commanded in the great
          house with a smile more royal and debonair than that of the master thereof,
          Member of Parliament though he was, and Justice of the Peace and Lord of the
          Manor? And Paul, fresh from his retrospect, looked at the girl's thin shoulders
          and sharp, intent profile, and wondered a little, somewhat ironically. He knew
          that she regarded him as a kind of god, for reasons of caste. Yet she was the
          daughter of a Morebury piano tuner, of unblemished parentage for generations.
          She had never known hunger and cold and the real sting of poverty. Miss Winwood
          herself knew more of drunken squalor. He saw himself a ragged and unwashed
          urchin, his appalling breeches supported by one brace, addressing her in
          familiar terms; and he saw her transfigured air of lofty disgust; whereupon he
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0187" n="170"/> laughed aloud in the middle of a
          most unhumorous sentence, much to Miss Smithers' astonishment. </p>
        <p>When he had finished his dictation he dismissed her and sat down to his
          writing. After a while Miss Winwood came in. The five years had treated her
          lightly. A whitening of the hair about her brows, which really enhanced the
          comeliness of her florid complexion, a few more lines at corners of eyes and
          lips, were the only evidences of the touch of Time's fingers. As she entered
          Paul swung round from his writing chair and started to his feet. I "Oh, Paul, I
          said the 20th for the Disabled Soldiers and Sailors, didn't I? I made a mistake.
          I'm engaged that afternoon." </p>
        <p>"I don't think so, dearest lady," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"I am." </p>
        <p>"Then you've told me nothing about it," said Paul the infallible. </p>
        <p>"I know," she said meekly. "It's all my fault. I never told you. I've asked the
          Bishop of Frome to lunch, and I can't turn him out at a quarter-past two, can I?
          What date is there free?" </p>
        <p>Together they bent over the engagement book, and after a little discussion the
          new date was fixed. </p>
        <p>"I'm rather keen on dates to-day," said Paul, pointing to the brass calendar. </p>
        <p>"Why ?" </p>
        <p>"It's exactly five years since I entered your dear service," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"We've worked you like a galley slave, and so I love your saying 'dear
          service,' " she replied gently. </p>
        <p>Paul, half sitting on the edge of the Cromwellian table in the bay of the
          window, laughed. "I could say infinitely more, dearest lady, if I were to let
          myself go." </p>
        <p>She sat on the arm of a great leathern chair. Their <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0188" n="171"/> respective attitudes signified a happy
          intimacy. "So long as you're contented, my dear boy&mdash;" she said. </p>
        <p>"Contented? Good heavens!" He waved a protesting hand. </p>
        <p>"You're ambitious." </p>
        <p>"Of course," said he. "What Would be the good of me if I wasn't?" </p>
        <p>"One of these days you'll be wanting to leave the nest and&mdash;what shall
          we say?&mdash;soar upwards." </p>
        <p>Paul, too acute to deny the truth of this prophecy said: "I probably shall. But
          I'll be the <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="it">rarissima avis</foreign>
          </hi>, to whom the abandoned nest will always be the prime object of his life's
          consideration." </p>
        <p>"Pretty,"' said Miss Winwood. </p>
        <p>"It's true." </p>
        <p>"I'm sure of it," she said pleasantly. "Besides, if you didn't leave the nest
          and make a name for yourself, you wouldn't be able to carry on our work. My
          brother and I, you see, are of the older generation&mdash;you of the
          younger." </p>
        <p>"You're the youngest woman I know," Paul declared. </p>
        <p>"I shan't be in a few years, and my brother is a good deal older than I." </p>
        <p>"Well, I can't get into Parliament right away," said Paul. "For one thing, I
          couldn't afford it." </p>
        <p>"We must find you a nice girl with plenty of money," she said, half in jest. </p>
        <p>"Oh, please don't. I should detest the sight of her. By the way, shall you want
          me on Saturday evening?" </p>
        <p>"No&mdash;unless it would be to take Miss Durning in to dinner." </p>
        <p>Now Miss Durning being an elderly, ugly heiress, it pleased Miss Winwood to be
          quizzical. He looked at her in mock reproof. "Dearest lady that you are, <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0189" n="172"/> I don't feel safe in your hands just
          now. I shall dine with the Princess on Saturday." </p>
        <p>An enigmatic smile flitted across Ursula Winwood's clear eyes. "What does she
          want you for?" </p>
        <p>"To entertain an Egyptologist," assured Paul. He waved his hand toward the
          letter on the table. "There it is in black and white." </p>
        <p>"I suppose for the next few days you'll be cramming hard." </p>
        <p>"It would be the polite thing to do, wouldn't it?" said Paul blandly. </p>
        <p>Miss Winwood shook her head and went away, and Paul happily resumed his work.
          In very truth she was to him the dearest of ladies. </p>
        <p>The Princess Zobraska was standing alone by the fireplace at the end of the
          long drawing-room when Paul was announced on Saturday evening. She was a
          distinguished-looking woman in the late twenties brown-haired,
          fresh-complexioned, strongly and at the same time delicately featured. Her dark
          blue eyes, veiled by lashes, smiled on him lazily as he approached; and lazily,
          too, her left arm stretched out, the palm of the hand downward, and she did not
          move. He kissed her knuckles, in orthodox fashion. </p>
        <p>"It is very good of you to come, Mr. Savelli," she said in a sweetly foreign
          accent, "and leave your interesting company at Drane's Court." </p>
        <p>"Any company without you, Princess, is chaos," said Paul. </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">Grand flatteur,
          va</foreign></hi>,&mdash;' said she. </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">C'est que vous Res irresistible,
              Princesse, surlout dans ce costume-l&#x00E2;</foreign></hi>." </p>
        <p>She touched his arm with an ostrich feather fan. "When it comes to massacring
          languages, Mr. Savelli, let me be the assassin." <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0190" n="173"/>
        </p>
        <p>"I laid the tribute of my heart at your feet in the most irreproachable
          grammar," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"But with the accent of John Bull. That's the only thing of John Bull you have
          about you. For the sake of my ears I must give you some lessons." </p>
        <p>"You'll find me such a pupil as never teacher had in the world before. When
          shall we begin?" </p>

        <p>
          <hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">Ah que vous &#x00EA;tes
              femme!</foreign>"</hi>

        </p>
        <p>She put her hands to her ears. "Listen. <hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="fr"
              >Que-vous-&#x00EA;tes-femme</foreign>"</hi> she said. </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr"
            >Que-vous-&#x00EA;tes-femme</foreign></hi>," Paul repeated parrotwise. "Is
          that better?" </p>
        <p>"A little." </p>
        <p>"I see the Greek Kalends have begun," said he. </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">M&#x00E9;chant</foreign></hi>, you
          have caught me in a trap," said she. </p>
        <p>And they both laughed. </p>
        <p>From which entirely foolish conversation it may be gathered that between our
          Fortunate Youth and the Princess some genial sun had melted the icy barriers of
          formality. He had known her for eighteen months, ever since she had bought
          Chetwood Park and settled down as the great personage of the countryside. He had
          met her many times, both in London and in Morebury; he had dined in state at her
          house; he had shot her partridges; he had danced with her; he had sat out dances
          with her, notably on one recent June night, in a London garden, where they lost
          themselves for an hour in the discussion of the relative parts that love played
          in a woman's life and in a man's. The Princess was French, <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">ancien r&#x00E9;gime</foreign>
          </hi>, of the blood of the Coligny, and she had married, in the French practical
          way, the Prince Zobraska, in whose career the only satisfactory incident history
          has to relate is the mere fact of his early demise. The details are less
          exhilarating. The poor little Princess, happily widowed <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0191" n="174"/> at one-and-twenty, had shivered the
          idea of love out of her system for some years. Then, as is the way of woman, she
          regained her curiosities. Great lady, of enormous fortune, she could have
          satisfied them, had she so chosen, with the large cynicism of a Catherine of
          Russia. She could also, had she so chosen, have married one of a hundred sighing
          and decorous gentlemen; but with none of them had she fallen ever so little in
          love, and without love she determined to try no more experiments; her
          determination, however, did not involve surrender of interest in the subject.
          Hence the notable discussion on the June night. Hence, perhaps, after a few
          other meetings of a formal character, the prettily intimate invitation she had
          sent to Paul. </p>
        <p>They were still laughing at the turn of the foolish conversation when the other
          guests began to enter the drawing-room. First came Edward Doon, the
          Egyptologist, a good-looking man of forty, having the air of a spruce don, with
          a pretty young wife, Lady Angela Doon; then Count Lavretsky, of the Russian
          Embassy, and Countess Lavretsky; Lord Bantry, a young Irish peer with literary
          ambitions; and a Mademoiselle de Cressy, a convent intimate of the Princess and
          her paid companion, completed the small party. </p>
        <p>Dinner was served at a round table, and Paul found himself between Lady Angela
          Doon, whom he took in, and the Countess Lavretsky. Talk was general and amusing.
          As Doon did not make, and apparently did not expect anyone to make any reference
          to King Qa or Amenhotep or Rameses&mdash; names vaguely floating in Paul's
          brain&mdash;but talked in a sprightly way about the French stage and the
          beauty of Norwegian fiords, Paul perceived that the Princess's alleged reason
          for her invitation was but a shallow pretext. Doon did not need any
          entertainment at all. Lady Angela, how- <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0192" n="175"
          /> ever, spoke of her dismay at the prospect of another winter in the desert;
          and drew a graphic little sketch of the personal discomforts to which
          Egyptologists were subjected. </p>
        <p>"I always thought Egyptologists and suchlike learned folk were stuffy and
          snuffy with goggles and ragged old beards," laughed Paul. "Your husband is a
          revelation." </p>
        <p>"Yes, he's quite human, isn't he?" she said with an affectionate glance across
          the table. "He's dead keen on his work, but he realizes&mdash;as many of his
          stuffy and snuffy confr&#x00E8;res don't&mdash; that there's a jolly,
          vibrating, fascinating, modern world in which one lives." </p>
        <p>"I'm glad to hear you say that about the modern world," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"What is Lady Angela saying about the modern world?" asked the Princess,
          separated from Paul's partner only by Count Lavretsky. </p>
        <p>"Singing paeans in praise of it," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"What is there in it so much to rejoice at?" asked the diplomatist, in a harsh
          voice. He was a man prematurely old, and looked at the world from beneath heavy,
          lizard-like eyelids. </p>
        <p>"Not only is it the best world we've got, but it's the best world we've ever
          had," cried Paul. "I don't know any historical world which would equal the
          modern, and as for the prehistoric&mdash;well, Professor Doon can tell
          us&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"As a sphere of amenable existence," said Doon with a smile, "give me Chetwood
          Park and Piccadilly." </p>
        <p>"That is mere hedonism," said Count Lavretsky. "You happen, like us all here,
          to command the creature comforts of modern wealthy conditions, which I grant are
          exceedingly superior to those commanded <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0193" n="176"
          /> by the great Emperors of ancient times. But we are in a small minority. And
          even if we were not&mdash;is that all?" </p>
        <p>"We have a finer appreciation of our individualities," said the Princess. "We
          lead a wider intellectual life. We are in instant touch, practically, with the
          thought of the habitable globe." </p>
        <p>"And with the emotive force of mankind," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"What is that?" asked Lady Angela. </p>
        <p>Why Paul, after the first glance of courtesy at the speaker, should exchange a
          quick glance with the Princess would be difficult to say. It was instinctive; as
          instinctive as the reciprocal flash of mutual understanding. </p>
        <p>"I think I know, but tell us," she said. </p>
        <p>Paul, challenged, defined it as the swift wave of sympathy that surged over the
          earth. A famine in India, a devastating earthquake in Mexico, a bid for freedom
          on the part of an oppressed population, a deed of heroism at sea&mdash;each
          was felt within practically a few moments, emotionally, in an English, French or
          German village. Our hearts were throbbing continuously at the end of telegraph
          wires. </p>
        <p>"And you call that pleasure?" asked Count Lavretsky. </p>
        <p>"It isn't hedonism, at any rate," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"I call it life," said the Princess. "Don't you?"&mdash;she turned to Doon. </p>
        <p>"I think what Mr. Savelli calls the emotive force of mankind helps to balance
          our own personal emotions," said be. </p>
        <p>"Or isn't it rather a wear and tear on the nervous system?" laughed his wife. </p>
        <p>"It seems so to me," said Count Lavretsky. "Perhaps, being a Russian, I am more
          primitive and envy <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0194" n="177"/> a nobleman of the
          time of Pharaoh who never heard of devastations in Mexico, did not feel his
          heart called upon to pulsate at anything beyond his own conerns. But he in his
          wisdom at his little world was vanity and was depressed. We moderns, with our
          infinitely bigger world and our infinitely greater knowledge, have no more
          wisdom than the Egyptian, and we see that the world is all the more vanity and
          are all the more overwhelmed with despair." </p>
        <p>"But&mdash;" said Paul. </p>
        <p>"But&mdash;" cried the Princess. </p>
        <p>Both laughed, and paused. Paul bowed with a slight gesture. </p>
        <p>"I am not overwhelmed with despair," the Princess continued. </p>
        <p>"Neither am I," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"I am keeping my end up wonderfully," said Lady Angela. </p>
        <p>"I am in a nest of optimists," Count Lavretsky groaned. "But was it not you,
          Lady Angela, who talked of wear and tear. </p>
        <p>"That was only to contradict my husband." </p>
        <p>"What is all this about?" asked the Countess Lavretsky, who had been discussing
          opera with Lord Bantry and Mademoiselle de Cressy. </p>
        <p>Doon scientifically crystallized the argument. It held the octette, while
          men-servants in powder and gold-laced livery offered <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">poires Zobraska</foreign>
          </hi>, a subtle creation of the<hi rend="italic">chef</hi>. Lord Bantry envied
          the contemplative calm which unexciting circumstances allowed the literary
          ancient. Mademoiselle de Cressy advanced the feminist view in favour of the
          modern world. The talk became the light and dancing interplay of opinion and
          paradox common to thousands of twentieth-century dinner-tables. </p>
        <p>"All the same," said Count Lavretsky, "they wear <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0195" n="178"/> you out, these emotive forces. Nobody
          is young nowadays. Youth is a lost art." </p>
        <p>"On the contrary," cried Mademoiselle de Cressy in French. "Everybody is young
          to-day. This pulsation of the heart keeps you young. It is the day of the young
          woman of forty-five." </p>
        <p>Count Lavretsky, who was fifty-nine, twirled a grey moustache. "I am one of the
          few people in the world who do not regret their youth. I do not regret mine,
          with its immaturity, its follies and subsequent headaches. I would sooner be the
          scornful philosopher of sixty than the credulous lover of twenty." </p>
        <p>"He always talks like that," said the Countess to Paul; "but when he met me
          first he was thirty-five&mdash;and"&mdash;she laughed&mdash;"and now
            <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">voil&#x00E0;</foreign>
          </hi>&mdash;for him there is no difference between twenty and sixty. <hi
            rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">Expliquez-moi &#x00E7;a</foreign>
          </hi>." </p>
        <p>"It's very simple," declared Paul. "In this century the thirties, forties, and
          fifties don't exist. You're either twenty or sixty." </p>
        <p>"I hope I shall always be twenty," said the Princess lightly. </p>
        <p>"Do you find your youth so precious, then?" asked Count Lavretsky. </p>
        <p>"More than I ever did!" She laughed and again met Paul's eyes. </p>
        <p>This time she flushed faintly as she held them for a fraction of a second. He
          had time to catch a veiled soft gleam intimate and disquieting. For some time he
          did not look again in her direction; when he did, he met in her eyes only the
          lazy smile with which she regarded all and sundry. </p>
        <p>Later in the evening she said to him: "I'm glad you opposed Lavretsky. He makes
          me shiver. He was born old and wrinkled. He has never had a thrill in his life."
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0196" n="179"/>
        </p>
        <p>"And if you don't have thrills when you're young, you can't expect to have them
          when you're old," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"He would ask what was the good of thrills." </p>
        <p>"You don't expect me to answer, Princess." </p>
        <p>"We know because we're young." </p>
        <p>They stood laughing in the joy of their full youth, a splendid couple, some
          distance away from the others, ostensibly inspecting a luminous little Cima on
          the wall. The Princess loved it as the bright ' jewel of her collection, and
          Paul, with his sense of beauty and knowledge of art, loved it too. Yet, instead
          of talking of the picture, they talked of Lavretsky, who was looking at them
          sardonically from beneath his heavy eyelids.</p>

        <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0197" n="180"/>
        <head>CHAPTER XII</head>

        <p>A FEW days afterwards you might have seen Paul dashing through the quiet main
          street Of Morebury in a high dog-cart, on his way to call on the Princess. A
          less Fortunate Youth might have had to walk, risking boots impolitely muddy, or
          to hire a funereal cab from the local job-master; but Paul had only to give an
          order, and the cart and showy chestnut were brought round to the front door of
          Drane's Court. He loved to drive the showy chestnut, whose manifold depravities
          were the terror of Miss Winwood's life. Why didn't he take the cob? It was so
          much safer. Whereupon he would reply gaily that in the first place he found no
          amusement in driving woolly lambs, and in the second that if he did not take
          some of the devil out of the chestnut it would become the flaming terror of the
          countryside. So Paul, spruce in hard felt hat and box-cloth overcoat, clattered
          joyously through the Morebury streets, returning the salutations of the little
          notabilities of the town with the air of the owner not only of horse and cart,
          but of half the hearts in the place. He was proud of his popularity, and it
          scarcely entered his head that he was not the proprietor of his equipage.
          Besides, he was going to call on the Princess. He hoped that she would be alone:
          not that he had anything particular to say to her, or had any defined idea of
          love-making; but he was eight-and-twenty, an age at which desire has not yet
          failed and there is not the sign of a burdensome grasshopper anywhere about. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0198" n="181"/>
        </p>
        <p>But the Princess was not alone. He found Mademoiselle de Cressy in charge of
          the tea-table and the conversation. Like many Frenchwomen, she had a
          high-pitched voice; she also had definite opinions on matter-of-fact subjects.
          Now when you have come to talk gossamer with an attractive and sympathetic
          woman, it is irritating to have to discuss Tariff Reform and the position of the
          working classes in Germany with somebody else, especially when the attractive
          and pretty woman does not give you in any way to understand that she would
          prefer gossamer to such arid topics. The Princess was as gracious as you please.
          She made him feel that he was welcome in her cosy boudoir; but there was no
          further exchange of mutually understanding glances. If a great lady entertaining
          a penniless young man can be demure, then demure was the Princess Sophie
          Zobraska. Paul, who prided himself on his knowledge of feminine subtlety, was at
          fault; but who was he to appreciate the repressive influence of a
          practical-minded convent friend, quickly formative and loudly assertive of
          opinions, on an impressionable lady awakening to curiosities? He was just a
          dunderhead, like any one of us&mdash;just as much as the most eminent
          feminine psychologist alive&mdash;which is saying a good deal. So he drove
          away disappointed, the sobriety of the chestnut's return trot through Morebury
          contrasting oddly with the dashing clatter of the former journey. </p>
        <p>It was some time before he met the Princess again, for an autumn session of
          Parliament required migration to Portland Place. The Princess, indeed, came to
          London, shortly afterwards, to her great house in Berkeley Square; but it was
          not till late November that he was fortunate enough to see her. Then it was only
          a kiss of the hand and a hurried remark or two, at a large dinner-party at the
          Winwoods'. You see, <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0199" n="182"/> there are such
          forces as rank and precedence at London dinner-parties, to which even princesses
          and fortunate youths have to yield. </p>
        <p>On this occasion, as he bent over her hand, he murmured: "May I say how
          beautiful you are to-night, Princess ?" </p>
        <p>She wore a costume of silver and deep blue, and the blue intensified the blue
          depths of her eyes. "I am delighted to please monsieur," she said in French. </p>
        <p>And that was their meeting. On parting she said again in French: "When are you
          coming to see me, fickle one?" </p>
        <p>"Whenever you ask me. I have called in vain." </p>
        <p>"You have a card for my reception next Tuesday?" </p>
        <p>"I have replied that I do myself the honour of accepting the Princess's
          gracious invitation." </p>
        <p>"I don't like London, do you?" she asked, allowing a touch of wistfulness to
          inflect her voice. </p>
        <p>"It has its charms. A row on the Serpentine, for instance, or a bicycle ride in
          Battersea Park." </p>
        <p>"How lovely it would be," she said, between laugh and sigh, "if only it could
          be kept out of the newspapers! I see it from here under the Fashionable
          Intelligence. 'The beautiful Princess Zobraska was observed in a boat on the
          ornamental water in Regent's Park with the well-known&mdash;<hi
            rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">tiens</foreign>
          </hi>&mdash;what are you?&mdash; politician, say&mdash;with the
          well-known young politician, Mr. Paul Savelli.' <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">Quel scandale, hein</foreign>
          </hi>?" </p>
        <p>"I must content myself with kissing your finger tips at your reception," said
          Paul. </p>
        <p>She smiled. "We will find a means," she said. </p>
        <p>At her reception, an assemblage glittering with the diamonds and orders of the
          great ones of the earth, she found only time to say: "Come to-morrow at five. I
          shall be alone." </p>
        <p>Darkness descended on Paul as he replied: "Im- <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0200"
            n="183"/> possible, Princess. Colonel Winwood wants me at the House." </p>
        <p>The next morning, greatly daring, he rang her up; for a telephone stood on the
          Fortunate Youth's table in his private sitting-room in Portland Place. </p>
        <p>"It is I, Princess, Paul Savelli." </p>
        <p>"What have you to say for yourself, Paul Savelli?" </p>
        <p>"I am at your feet." </p>
        <p>"Why can't you come to-day?" </p>
        <p>He explained. </p>
        <p>"But tell Colonel Winwood that I want you"&mdash;the voice was imperious. </p>
        <p>"Would that be wise, Princess?" </p>
        <p>"Wise?" </p>
        <p>"Yes. Don't you see?" </p>
        <p>He waited for an answer. There was blank electric current whirring faintly on
          his ear. He thought she had rung off&mdash;rung off not only this
          conversation, but all converse in the future. At last, after the waiting of
          despair, came the voice, curiously meek. "Can you come Friday ?" </p>
        <p>"With joy and delight." The words gushed out tempestuously. </p>
        <p>"Good. At five o'clock. And leave your John Bull wisdoril on the doorstep." </p>
        <p>She rang off abruptly, and Paul stood ruminating puzzlewise on the audacious
          behest. </p>
        <p>On Friday he presented himself at her house in Berkeley Square. He found her
          gracious, but ironical in attitude, very much on the defensive. She received him
          in the Empire drawing room&mdash;very stiff and stately in its appointments.
          It had the charm (and the intrinsic value) of a museum; it was as cosy as a room
          (under present arrangements) at Versailles. The great wood fire alone redeemed
          it from artistic bleakness. Tea was brought in by portentous, pow- <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0201" n="184"/> dered footmen in scarlet and gold. She
          was very much the princess; the princess in her state apartments, a different
          personage from the pretty woman in a boudoir. Paul, sensitive as far as it is
          given man to be, saw that if he had obeyed her and left his John Bull wisdom on
          the doorstep, he would have regretted it. Obviously she was punishing him;
          perhaps herself; perhaps both of them. She kept a wary, appraising eye on him,
          as they talked their commonplaces. Paul's attitude had the correctness of a
          young diplomatist paying a first formal call. It was only when he rose to go
          that her glance softened. She laughed a queer little laugh. </p>
        <p>"I hear that you are going to address a meeting in the North of London next
          week." </p>
        <p>"That is so," said Paul; "but how can my unimportant engagements have come to
          the ears of Your Highness?" </p>
        <p>"I read my newspapers like everybody else. Did you not know that there were
          announcements?" </p>
        <p>Paul laughed. "I put them in myself. You see," he explained, "we want our Young
          England League to be as widely known as possible. The more lambs we can get into
          the fold, the better." </p>
        <p>" Perhaps if you asked me very prettily," she said, "I might come and bear you
          speak." </p>
        <p>" Princess!" His olive cheek flushed with pleasure and his eyes sparkled. "It
          would be an undreamed-of honour. It is such things that angels do." </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">Eh bien, je viendrai</foreign></hi>. You
          ought to speak well. Couldn't you persuade them to give the place a better name?
          Hickney Heath! It hurts the roof of one's mouth. <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">Tiens</foreign>
          </hi>&mdash;would it help the Young England League if you announced my name
          in the newspapers?" </p>
        <p>"Dear Princess, you overwhelm me. But&mdash;" <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0202" n="185"/>
        </p>
        <p>"Now, don't ask me if it is wise." She smiled in mockery. "You print the names
          of other people who are supporting you. Mr. John Felton, M.P., who will take the
          chair, Colonel Winwood, M.P., and Miss Winwood, the Dean of Halifax and Lady
          Harbury, et cetera, et cetera. Why not poor Princess Sophie Zobraska ?" </p>
        <p>"You have a good memory, Princess." </p>
        <p>She regarded him lazily. "Sometimes. When does the meeting begin ?" </p>
        <p>"At eight. Oh, I forget." His face fell. "How can you manage it? You'll have to
          dine at an unearthly hour." </p>
        <p>"What does it matter even if one doesn't dine&mdash;in a good cause?" </p>
        <p>"You are everything that is perfect," said Paul fervently. </p>
        <p>She dismissed a blissful youth. The Princess Zobraska cared as much for the
          Young England League as for an Anti-Nose-Ring Society in Central Africa. Would
          it help the Young England League, indeed! He laughed aloud on the lamp-lit
          pavement of decorous Berkeley Square. For what other man in the world would she
          dine at six and spend the evening in a stuffy hall in North London? He felt
          fired to great achievement. He would make her proud of him, his Princess, his
          own beautiful, stately, royal Princess. The dream had come true. He loved a
          Princess; and she&mdash;? If she cared naught for him, why was she
          cheerfully contemplating a six-o'clock dinner? And why did she do a thousand
          other things which crowded on his memory? Was he loved? The thought thrilled
          him. Here was no beautiful seductress of suspect title such as he had heard of
          during his sojourn in the Gotha Almanack world, but the lineal descendant of a
          princely house, the widow of a genuinely royal, though <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0203" n="186"/> deboshed personage. Perhaps you may say
          that the hero of a fairy-tale never thinks of the mere rank of his beloved
          princess. If you do, you are committing all sorts of fallacies in your premises.
          For one thing, who said that Paul was a hero? For another, who said this was a
          fairy-tale? For yet another, I am not so sure that the swineherd is not
          impressed by the rank of his beloved. You must remember the insistent, lifelong
          dream of the ragged urchin. You must also reflect that the heart of any
          high-born youth in the land might well have been fluttered by signs of peculiar
          favour from Princess Sophie Zobraska. Why' then, should Paul be blamed for
          walking on air instead of greasy pavement on the way from Berkeley Square to
          Portland Place? Moreover, as sanity returned to him, his quick sense recognized
          in his Princess's offer to support him, a lovely indiscretion. Foreign ladies of
          high position must be chary of their public appearances. Between the row-boat on
          the Serpentine and the platform in the drill hall, Hickney Heath, the difference
          was but one of degree. And for him alone was this indiscretion about to be
          committed. His exultation was tempered by tender solicitude. </p>
        <p>At dinner that evening&mdash;he was dining alone with the
          Winwoods&mdash;he said: "I've persuaded the Princess to come to our meeting
          on Friday. Isn't it good of her?" </p>
        <p>"Very good," replied Colonel Winwood. "But what interest can she take in the
          lower walks of English politics ?" </p>
        <p>"It isn't English politics," said Paul. "It's world politics. The Princess is
          an aristocrat and is tremendously keen on the Conservative principle. She thinks
          our scheme for keeping the youth of the nation free from the taint of Socialism
          is magnificent." </p>
        <p>"H'm!" said the Colonel. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0204" n="187"/>
        </p>
        <p>"And I thought Miss Winwood would be pleased if I inveigled Her Highness on to
          the platform," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Why, of course it's a good thing," assented the Colonel. "But how the deuce
          did you get her?" </p>
        <p>"Yes, how?" asked Miss Winwood, with a smile in her straight blue eyes. </p>
        <p>"How does one get anything one wants in this world," said Paul, "except by
          going at it, hammer and tongs ?" </p>
        <p>A little later, when Paul opened the dining-room for her to pass out, she
          touched his shoulder affectionately and laughed. "Hammer and tongs to Sophie
          Zobraska! Oh, Paul, aren't you a bit of a humbug?" </p>
        <p>Perhaps he was. But he was ingenuous in his desire to shield his Princess's
          action from vain conjecture. It were better that he should be supposed, in
          vulgar phrase, to have roped her in, as he had roped in a hundred other
          celebrities in his time. For there the matter ended. On the other hand, if he
          proclaimed the lady's spontaneous offer, it might be subjected to heaven knew
          how many interpretations. Paul owed much of his success in the world to such
          instinctive delicacies. He worked far into the night, composing his speech on
          England's greatness to the beautiful eyes of his French Princess. </p>
        <p>The Young England League was his pet political interest. It had been
          inaugurated some years before he joined the Winwoods. Its objects were the
          training of the youth, the future electorate of England, in the doctrines of
          Imperialism, Constitutionalism and sound civicism, as understood by the
          intellectual Conservatives. Its mechanical aims were to establish lodges
          throughout the country. Every town and rural district should have its lodge, in
          connection wherewith should be not only addresses on political and social <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0205" n="188"/> subjects, but also football and cricket
          clubs, entertainments for both sexes such as dances, whist-drives, excursions of
          archaeological and educational interest, and lantern (and, later,
          cinematographic) lectures on the wide aspects of Imperial Britain. Its appeal
          was to the young, the recruit in the battle of life, who in a year or two would
          qualify for a vote and, except for blind passion and prejudice, not know what
          the deuce to do with it. The octogenarian Earl of Watford was President; Colonel
          Winwood was one of a long list of Vice-Presidents; Miss Winwood was on the
          Council ; a General Hankin, a fussy, incompetent person past his prime, was
          Honorary Secretary. </p>
        <p>Paul worked with his employers for a year on the League thinking little of its
          effectiveness. One day, when they spoke despairingly of progress, he said, not
          in so many words, but in effect: "Don't you see what's wrong? This thing is run
          for young people, and you've got old fossils like Lord Watford and General
          Hankin running it. Let me be Assistant Secretary to Hankin' and I'll make things
          hum." </p>
        <p>And thinking the words of the youth were wise, they used their influence with
          the Council, and Paul became Assistant Secretary, and after a year or two things
          began to hum so disconcertingly that General Hankin resigned in order to take
          the Presidency of the Wellingtonian Defence Association, and almost
          automatically Paul slipped into his place. With the instinct of the man of
          affairs he persuaded the Council to change his title. An Honorary Secretary is
          but a dilettante, an amateur carrying no weight, whereas an Organizing Secretary
          is a devil of a fellow professedly dynamic. So Paul became Organizing Secretary
          of the Young England League, and made things hum all the louder. He put fresh
          life into local Committees and local Secretaries by a paternal interest in <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0206" n="189"/> their doings, making them feel the
          pulsations of the throbbing heart of headquarters. If a local lodge was in need
          of speakers, he exercised his arts of persuasion and sent them down in
          trainloads. He visited personally as many lodges as his other work permitted. In
          fact, he was raising the League from a jejune experiment into a flourishing
          organization. To his secret delight, old Lord Watford resigned the chairmanship
          owing to the infirmities of old age, and Lord Harbury, a young and energetic
          peer whom Paul had recently driven into the ranks of the Vice-Presidents, was
          elected in his stead. Paul felt the future of the League was assured. </p>
        <p>With a real Member of Parliament to preside, a. real dean to propose the vote
          of thanks, another Member of Parliament and two ex-mayors of the borough to add
          silent dignity to the proceedings, well-known ladies, including, now, a real
          Princess to grace the assembly, this meeting of the Hickney Heath Lodge was the
          most important occasion on which Paul had appeared in public. </p>
        <p>"I hope you won't be nervous," said Miss Winwood. on the morning of the
          meeting. </p>
        <p>"I nervous?" He laughed. "What is there to be nervous about ?" </p>
        <p>"I've had over twenty years' experience of public speaking, and I'm always
          nervous when I get UP." </p>
        <p>"It's only because you persistently refuse to realize what a wonderful woman
          you are," he said affectionately. </p>
        <p>"And you," she teased, "are you always realizing what a wonderful man you are?" </p>
        <p>He cried with his sunny boldness: "Why not? It's faith in oneself and one's
          destiny that gets things done." <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0207" n="190"/>
        </p>
        <p>The drill hall was full. Party feeling ran high in those days at Hickney Heath,
          for a Liberal had ousted a Unionist from a safe seat at the last General
          Election, and the stalwarts of the defeated party, thirsting for revenge,
          supported the new movement. If a child was not born a Conservative, he should be
          made one. That was the watchword of the League. They were also prepared to
          welcome the new star that had arisen to guide the younger generation out of the
          darkness. When, therefore, the Chairman, Mr. John Felton, M.P., who had held
          minor office in the last administra-tion, had concluded his opening remarks,
          having sketched briefly the history of the League and intro duced Mr. Paul
          Savelli, in the usual eulogistic terms, as their irresistible Organizing
          Secretary, and Paul in his radiant young manhood sprang up before them, the
          audience greeted him with enthusiastic applause. They had expected, as an
          audience does expect in an unknown speaker, any one of the usual types of
          ordinary looking politicians&mdash;perhaps bald, perhaps grey headed,
          perhaps pink and fat&mdash;it did not matter; but they did not expect the
          magnetic personality of this young man of astonishing beauty, with his perfect
          features, wavy black hair, athletic build and laughing eyes, who seemed the
          embodiment of youth and joy and purpose and victory. </p>
        <p>Before he spoke a word, he knew that he bad them under his control, and he felt
          the great thrill of it. Physically he had the consciousness of a blaze of light,
          of a bare barn of an ungalleried place, of thickly-set row upon row of faces,
          and a vast confused flutter of beating hands. The applause subsided. He turned
          with his "Mr. Chairman, Your Highness, Ladies and Gentlemen," to the circle
          behind him, caught Miss Winwood, his dearest lady's smile, caught and held for a
          hundredth part of a second the <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0208" n="191"/> deep
          blue eyes of the Princess&mdash;she wore a great hat with a grey feather and
          a chinchilla coat thrown open, and looked the incarnation of all the beauty and
          all the desires of all his dreams&mdash;and with a flash of gladness faced
          the audience and plunged into his speech. </p>
        <p>It began with a denunciation of the Little Englander. At that period one heard,
          perhaps, more of the Little Englander than one does nowadays&mdash;which to
          some people's way of thinking is a pity. The Little Englander (according to
          Paul) was a purblind creature, with political vision ice-bound by the economic
          condition of the labouring classes in Great Britain. The Little Englander had no
          sense of patriotism. The Little Englander had no sense of Empire. He had no
          sense of India, Australia, Canada. He had no sense of foreign nations' jealousy
          of England's secular supremacy. He had a distinct idea, however, of three
          nationalities; those of Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The inhabitants of those
          three small nations took peculiar pains to hammer that idea into his head. But
          of England he had no conception save as a mere geographical expression, a little
          bit of red on a map of Europe, a vague place where certain sections of the
          population clamoured for-much pay and little work. His dream was a parochial
          Utopia where the Irish peasant, the Welsh farmer and the Scottish crofter should
          live in luxury, and when these were satisfied, the English operative should live
          in moderate comfort. The Little Englander, in his insensate altruism, dreamed of
          these three nations entirely independent of England, except in the trivial
          matter of financial support. He wanted Australia, Canada, South Africa, to sever
          their links from him and take up with America, Germany,
          Switzerland&mdash;anybody so long as they did not interfere with his
          gigantic scheme for providing <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0209" n="192"/> tramps
          in Cromarty with motor cars and dissolute Welsh shepherds with champagne. As for
          India, why not give it up to a benign native government which would depend upon
          the notorious brotherly love between Hindoo and Mussulman? If Russia, foolish,
          unawakened Russia, took possession of it, what would it matter to the miner of
          Merthyr Tydvil? As for England, provided such a country existed, she would be
          perfectly happy. The rich would provide for the poor&mdash;and what did
          anyone want further? Paul took up the Little Englander in his arms and tossed
          him in the air, threw him on the ground and jumped upon him. He cast his
          mutilated fragments with rare picturesqueness upon a Guy Fawkes bonfire. The
          audience applauded vociferously. He waited with a gay smile for silence,
          scanning them closely for the first time; and suddenly the smile faded from his
          face. In the very centre of the third row sat two people who did not applaud.
          They were Barney Bill and Jane. </p>
        <p>He looked at them fascinated. There could be no mistake. Barney Bill's cropped,
          shoe-brush hair was white as the driven snow; but the wry, bright-eyed face was
          unchanged. And Jane, quietly and decently dressed, her calm eyes fixed on him,
          was&mdash;Jane. These two curiously detached themselves against the human
          background. It was only the sudden stillness of the exhausted applause that
          brought him to consciousness of his environment; that, and a heaven-sent fellow
          at the back of the audience who shouted: "Go on, sonny!" </p>
        <p>Whereupon he plucked himself together with a swift toss of the head, and
          laughed his gay laugh. "Of course I'm going on, if you will let me. This is only
          the beginning of what I've got to tell you of the Englishman who fouls the nest
          of England&mdash;who <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0210" n="193"/> fouls the
          nest of all that matters in the future history of mankind." </p>
        <p>There was more applause. It was the orator's appeal to the mass. It set Paul
          back into the stream of his argument. He forgot Barney Bill and Jane, and went
          on with his speech, pointedly addressing the young, telling them what England
          was, what England is, what Englishmen, if they are true to England, shall be. It
          was for the young, those who came fresh to life with the glories of England
          fresh in their memories, from Crecy to the Armada, from the Armada to Waterloo,
          to keep the banner of England flying over their topmost roofs. </p>
        <p>It was a fighting, enthusiastic, hyperbolic speech, glowing, as did the young
          face of the speaker, with the divine fire of youth. It ended triumphantly. He
          sat down to an ovation. Smiles and handshakes and words of praise surrounded him
          on the platform. Miss Winwood pressed his hand and said, "Well done." The
          Princess regarded him with flushed cheeks and starry eyes. It was only when
          silence fell on the opening words of the Dean of Halifax that he searched the
          rows in front for Barney Bill and Jane. They were still there. Impulsively he
          scribbled a few lines on a scrap of paper torn from his rough notes: "I must see
          you. Wait outside the side entrance for me after the meeting is over. Love to
          you both. Paul." A glance round showed him an attendant of the hall lurking at
          the back of the platform. He slipped quietly from his seat by the Chairman's
          side and gave the man the paper with directions as to its destination. Then he
          returned. just before the Dean ended, he saw the note delivered. Jane read it,
          whispered its contents to Bill and seemed to nod acquiescence. It was fitting
          that these two dear ghosts of the past should appear for the first time <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0211" n="194"/> in his hour of triumph. He longed to
          have speech with them, The Dean of Halifax was brief, the concluding ceremonies
          briefer. The audience gave Paul a parting cheer and dispersed, while Paul, the
          hero of the evening, received the congratulations of his friends. </p>
        <p>"Those are things that needed saying, but we're too cautious to say them,"
          remarked the Chairman. </p>
        <p>"We've got to be," said Colonel Winwood. </p>
        <p>"The glory of irresponsibility," smiled the Dean. </p>
        <p>"You don't often get this kind of audience," Paul answeted with a laugh. "A
          political infants' school. One has to treat things in broad splashes." </p>
        <p>"You almost persuade me to be an Englishwoman," said. the Princess. </p>
        <p>Paul bowed. "But what more beautiful thing can there be than a Frenchwoman with
          England in her heart? <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">Je ne demande pas mieux</foreign>
          </hi>." </p>
        <p>And the Princess did not put her hands to her ears. </p>
        <p>The group passed slowly from the platform through a sort of committee room at
          the back, and reached the side entrance, Here they lingered, exchanging
          farewells. The light streamed dimly through the door on the strip of pavement
          between two hedges of spectators, and on the panelling and brass-work of an
          automobile by the curb. A chauffeur, with rug on arm, stepped forward and
          touched his cap, as the Princess appeared, and opened the door of the car. Paul,
          bare-headed, accompanied her across the pavement. Halt way she stopped for a
          second to adjust a slipping fur. He aided her quickly and received a bright
          smile of thanks. She entered the car&mdash;held out her hand for, his kiss. </p>
        <p>"Come and see me soon. I'll write or telephone." </p>
        <p>The car rolled away. The Winwoods' carriage drove up.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XIII</head>

        <p>PAUL looked from side to side at the palely lit faces of the spectators, trying
          to distinguish Barney Bill and Jane. But he did not see them. He was
          disappointed and depressed, seized with a curious yearning for his own people.
          Vehicle after vehicle drew up and carried away the remainder of the platform
          group, and Paul was left in the doorway with the President and Honorary
          Secretary of the local lodge. The little crowd began to melt away. Suddenly his
          heart leaped and, after a hasty good night to the two officials, he sprang
          forward and, to their astonishment, gripped the hand of a bent and wizened old
          man. </p>
        <p>"Barney Bill ! This is good. Where is Jane?" </p>
        <p>"Close by," said Bill. </p>
        <p>The President and Honorary Secretary waved farewells and marched away. Out of
          the gloom came Jane, somewhat shyly. He took both her hands and looked upon her,
          and laughed. "My dear Jane! What ages since we lost each other!" </p>
        <p>"Seven years, Mr. Savelli." </p>
        <p>"'Mr. Savelli I' Rubbish! Paul." </p>
        <p>"Begging your pardon," said Barney Bill, "but I've got a pal 'ere what I've
          knowed long before you was born, and he'd like to tell yer how he enjoyed your
          speech." </p>
        <p>A tall man, lean and bearded, and apparently very well dressed, came forward.
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0216" n="197"/>
        </p>
        <p>"This is my old pal, Silas Finn," said Bill. </p>
        <p>"Delighted to meet you, Mr. Finn," said Paul, shaking hands. </p>
        <p>"I too," said the man gravely. </p>
        <p>"Silas Finn's a Councillor of the Borough," said Bill proudly. </p>
        <p>"You should have been on the platform," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"I attended in my private capacity," replied Mr. Finn. </p>
        <p>He effaced himself. Paul found himself laughing into Barney Bill's twinkling
          eyes. "Dear old Bill," he cried, clapping his old friend on the shoulder. "How
          are things going? How's the caravan? I've looked out for it on so many country
          roads." </p>
        <p>"I'm thinking of retiring," said Bill. "I can only do a few summer months
          now&mdash;and things isn't what they was." </p>
        <p>"And Jane?" He turned to her. </p>
        <p>"I'm Mr. Finn's secretary." </p>
        <p>"Oh," said Paul. Mr. Finn, then, was an important person. </p>
        <p>The drill hall attendant shut the door, and save for the street lamps they were
          in gloom. There was an embarrassed little silence. Paul broke it by saying: "We
          must exchange addresses, and fix up a meeting for a nice long talk." </p>
        <p>"If you would like to have a talk with your old friends now, my house is at
          your disposal," said Mr. Finn, in a soft, melancholy voice. "It is not far from
          here." </p>
        <p>"That's very kind of you&mdash;but I couldn't trespass on your
          hospitality." </p>
        <p>"Gor bless you," exclaimed Barney Bill. "Nothing of the kind. Didn't I tell yer
          I've knowed him since we was lads together? And Jane lives there." </p>
        <p>Paul laughed. "In that case&mdash;" <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0217"
            n="198"/>
        </p>
        <p>"You'll be most welcome," said Mr. Finn. "This way." </p>
        <p>He went ahead with Barney Bill, whose queer side limp awoke poignant memories
          of the Bludston brickfield. Paul followed with Jane. </p>
        <p>"And what have you been doing?" he asked. </p>
        <p>"Typewriting. Then Bill came across Mr. Finn, whom he hadn't seen for years,
          and got me the position of secretary. Otherwise I've been doing nothing
          particular." </p>
        <p>"If you knew what a hunt I had years ago to find you," he said, and began to
          explain the set of foolish circumstances when they turned the corner of the
          drill hall and found a four-wheeled cab waiting. </p>
        <p>"I had already engaged it for my friends and myself," Mr. Finn explained. "Will
          you get in?" </p>
        <p>Jane and Paul and Mr. Finn entered the cab. Barney Bill, who liked air and for
          whom the raw November night was filled apparently with balmy zephyrs, clambered
          in his crablike way next the driver. They started. </p>
        <p>"What induced you to come to-night?" Paul asked. </p>
        <p>"We saw the announcement in the newspapers," replied Jane. "Barney Bill said
          the Mr. Paul Savelli could, be no one else but you. I said it couldn't." </p>
        <p>"Why?" he asked sharply. </p>
        <p>"There are heaps of people of the same name." </p>
        <p>"But you didn't think I was equal to it?" </p>
        <p>She laughed a short laugh. "That's just how you used to talk. You haven't
          changed much." </p>
        <p>"I hope I haven't," replied Paul earnestly. "And I don't think you've changed
          either." </p>
        <p>"Very little has happened to change me," said Jane. </p>
        <p>The cab lumbered on through dull, dimly lit, residential roads. Only by the
          swinging gleam of an occasional street lamp could Paul distinguish the faces <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0218" n="199"/> of his companions. "I hope you're on
          our side, Mr. Finn," he said politely to his host, who sat on the small back
          seat. </p>
        <p>"I don't disagree with much that you said to-night. But you are on the side of
          wealth and aristocracy. I am on the side of the downtrodden and oppressed." </p>
        <p>"But so am I," cried Paul. "The work of every day of my life tends to help
          them." </p>
        <p>"You're a Conservative and I'm a Radical." </p>
        <p>"What do labels matter? We're both attacking the same problem, only from
          different angles." </p>
        <p>"Very likely, Mr. Savelli; but you'll pardon me if, according to my political
          creed, I regard your angle as an obtuse one." </p>
        <p>Paul wondered greatly who he could be, this grave, intelligent friend of Barney
          Bill's, who spoke with such dignity and courtesy. In his speech was a trace of
          rough accent; but his words were chosen with precision. </p>
        <p>"You think we glance off, whereas your attack is more direct," laughed Paul. </p>
        <p>"That is so. I hope you don't mind my saying it. You were the challenger." </p>
        <p>"I was. But anyhow we're not going to be enemies." </p>
        <p>"God forbid," said Mr. Finn. </p>
        <p>Presently the cab stopped before a fairly large detached house standing back
          from the road. A name which Paul could not decipher was painted on the top bar
          of the gate. They trooped through and up some steps to the front door, which Mr.
          Finn opened with his latchkey. The first impression that Paul had on entering a
          wide vestibule was a blaze of gilt frames containing masses of bright, fresh
          paint. A parlour-maid appeared, and helped with hats and coats.</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0219" n="200"/>

        <p>"We are having a very simple supper, Mr. Savelli. Will you join us?" said Mr.
          Finn. </p>
        <p>"With the greatest pleasure," said Paul. </p>
        <p>The host threw open the dining-room door on the right. Jane and Paul entered;
          were alone for a few moments, during which Paul heard Barney Bill say in a
          hoarse whisper: "Let me have my hunk of bread and beef in the kitchen, Silas.
          You know as how I hates a fork and I likes to eat in my shirt sleeves." </p>
        <p>Paul seized Jane by the arms and regarded her luminously. He murmured: "Did you
          hear? The dear old chap!" </p>
        <p>She raised clear, calm eyes. "Aren't you shocked?" </p>
        <p>He shook her. "What do you take me for?" </p>
        <p>Jane was rebellious. "For what girls in my position generally call a 'toff.'
          You&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"You're horrid," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"The word's horrid, not me. You're away up above us." </p>
        <p>" 'Us' seems to be very prosperous, anyhow," said Paul, looking round him. Jane
          watched him jealously and saw his face change. The dining room, spaciously
          proportioned, was, like the vestibule, a mass of gilt frames and staring paint.
          Not an inch of wall above the oak dado was visible. Crude landscapes, wooden
          portraits, sea studies with waves of corrugated iron, subject pictures of
          childishly sentimental appeal, blinded the eyes. It looked as if a kindergarten
          had been the selecting committee for an exhibition of the Royal Academy. It
          looked also as if the kindergarten had replaced the hanging committee also. It
          was a conglomerate massacre. It was pictorial anarchy. It was individualism
          baresark, amok, crazily frantic. And an execrably vile, nerve-destroying
          individualism at that. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0220" n="201"/>
        </p>
        <p>Paul released Jane, who kept cool, defiant eyes on him. </p>
        <p>"What do you think of it?" </p>
        <p>He smiled. "A bit disconcerting." </p>
        <p>"The whole house is like this." </p>
        <p>"It's so new," said Paul. </p>
        <p>He looked about him again. The long table was plainly laid for three at the far
          end. The fare consisted of a joint of cold beef, a cold tart suggestive of
          apple, a bit of Cheshire cheese, and celery in a glass vase. Of table decoration
          of any kind there was no sign. A great walnut monstrosity meagrely equipped
          performed the functions of a sideboard. The chairs, ten straight-backed, and two
          easy by the fireplace, of which one was armless, were upholstered in saddlebag,
          yellow and green. In the bay of the red-curtained window was a huge terra-cotta
          bust of an ivy-crowned and inane Austrian female. There was a great fireplace in
          which a huge fire blazed cheerily, and on the broad, deep hearth stood little
          coloured plaster figures of stags, of gnomes, of rabbits, one ear dropping, the
          other ear cocked, of galloping hounds unknown to the fancy, scenting and
          pursuing an invisible foe. </p>
        <p>She watched him as he scanned the room. </p>
        <p>"Who is Mr. Finn?" he asked in a low voice. </p>
        <p>"Many years ago he was 'Finn's Fried Fish.' Now he's 'Fish Palaces, Limited.'
          They're all over London. You can't help seeing them even from a motor car." </p>
        <p>"I've seen them," said Paul. </p>
        <p>The argument outside the door having ended in a victory for the host, he
          entered the room, pushing Barney Bill gently in front of him. For the first time
          Paul saw him in the full light. He beheld a man sharply featured, with hair and
          beard, once raven- <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0221" n="202"/> black, irregularly
          streaked with white&mdash;there seemed to be no intermediary shades of
          grey&mdash;and deep melancholy eyes. There hung about him the atmosphere of
          infinite, sorrowful patience that might mark a Polish patriot. As the runner of
          a successful fried fish concern he was an incongruity. As well, thought Paul,
          picture the late Cardinal Newman sharpening knife on steel outside a butcher's
          shop, and crying, "buy, buy," in lusty invitation. Then Paul noticed that he was
          oddly apparelled. He wore the black frock-coat suit of a Methodist preacher at
          the same time as the rainbow tie, diamond tie-pin, heavy gold watch-chain,
          diamond ring and natty spats of a professional bookmaker. The latter oddities,
          however, did not detract from the quiet, mournful dignity of his face and
          manner. Paul felt himself in the presence of an original personality. </p>
        <p>The maid came in and laid a fourth place. Mr. Finn waved Paul to a seat on his
          right, Barney Bill to one next Paul; Jane sat on his left. </p>
        <p>"I will ask a blessing," said Mr. Finn. </p>
        <p>He asked one for two minutes in the old-fashioned Evangelical way, bringing his
          guest into his address to the Almighty with an almost pathetic courtesy. "I am
          afraid, Mr. Savelli," said he, when he sat down and began to carve the beef, "I
          have neither wine nor spirits to offer you. I am a strict teetotaller; and so is
          Miss Seddon. But as I knew my old friend Simmons would be unhappy without his
          accustomed glass of beer&mdash; -" </p>
        <p>"That's me," said Barney Bill, nudging Paul with his elbow. "Simmons. You never
          knowed that afore, did yer? Beg pardon, guv'nor, for interrupting." </p>
        <p>"Well, there's a jug of beer&mdash;and that is all at this hour, except
          water, that I can put before you." </p>
        <p>Paul declared that beer was delicious and peculiarly <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0222" n="203"/> acceptable after public speaking, and
          demonstrated his appreciation by draining the glass which the maid poured out. </p>
        <p>"You wanted that badly, sonny," said Barney Bill. "The next thing to drinking
          oneself is to see another chap what enjoys swallering it." </p>
        <p>"Bill!" said Jane reprovingly. </p>
        <p>Barney Bill cocked his white poll across the table with the perkiness of a
          quaint bird&mdash; Paul saw that the years had brought a striation of tiny
          red filaments to his weather-beaten face&mdash;and fixed her with his little
          glittering eyes. "Bill what? You think I'm 'urting his feelings?" He jerked a
          thumb towards his host. "I ain't. He thinks good drink's bad because bad has
          come of it to him&mdash;not that he ever took a drop too much, mind
          yer&mdash;but bad has come of it to him, and I think good drink's good
          because nothing but good has come of it to me. And we've agreed to differ. Ain't
          we, Silas?" </p>
        <p>"If every man were as moderate as you, and I am sure as Mr. Savelli, I should
          have nothing to say against it. Why should I? But the working man, unhappily, is
          not moderate." </p>
        <p>"I see," said Paul. "You preach, or advocate&mdash;I think you
          preach&mdash;total abstinence, and so feel it your duty to abstain
          yourself." </p>
        <p>"That is so," said Mr. Finn, helping himself to mustard. "I don't wish to bore
          you with my concerns; but I'm a fairly large employer of labour. Now I have
          found that by employing only pledged abstainers I get extraordinary results. I
          exact a very high rate of insurance, towards a fund&mdash;I need not go into
          details&mdash;to which I myself contribute a percentage&mdash;a far
          higher rate than would be possible if they spent their earnings on drink. I
          invest the whole lot in my business&mdash;their stoppages from wages and my
          contribu- <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0223" n="204"/> tions. I guarantee them 3
          per cent.; I give them, actually, the dividends that accrue to the holders of
          ordinary stock in my company. They also have the general advantages of
          insurance&mdash;sickness, burial, maternity, and so forth&mdash;that
          they would get from an ordinary benefit society." </p>
        <p>"But that's enormous," cried Paul, with keen interest. "On the face of it, it
          seems impossible. It seems entirely uneconomic. Co-operative trading is one
          thing; private insurance another. But how can you combine the two?" </p>
        <p>"The whole secret lies in the marvellously increased efficiency of the
          employee." He developed his point. </p>
        <p>Paul listened attentively. "But," said he, when his host concluded, "isn't it
          rather risky? Supposing, for the sake of argument, your business failed." </p>
        <p>Mr. Finn held up the lean, brown hand on which the diamond sparkled. "My
          business cannot fail." </p>
        <p>Paul started. The assertion had a strange solemnity. "Without impertinence,"
          said he, "why can't it fail?" </p>
        <p>"Because God is guiding it," said Silas Finn. </p>
        <p>The fanatic spoke. Paul regarded him with renewed interest. The black hair
          streaked with white, banging over the temples on the side away from the parting,
          the queerly streaked beard, the clear-cut ascetic features, the deep, mournful
          eyes in whose depths glowed a soul on fire, gave him the appearance of a mad but
          sanctified apostle. Barney Bill, who profoundly distrusted all professional
          drinkers of water, such as Mr. Finn's employees, ate his cold beef silently, in
          the happy surmise that no one was paying the least attention to his
          misperformances with knife, fork and fingers. Jane looked steadily from Paul to
          Silas and from Silas to Paul. </p>
        <p>Paul said: "How do you know God is guiding it?" </p>
        <p>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0224" n="205"/> At the back of his mind was an
          impulse of mirth--there was a touch of humorous blasphemy in the conception of
          the Almighty as managing director of "Fish Palaces, Limited"&mdash;but the
          nominal earthly managing director saw not the slightest humour in the
          proposition. </p>
        <p>"Who is guiding you in your brilliant career?" he asked. </p>
        <p>Paul threw out his hands, in the once practised and now natural foreign
          gesture. "I'm not an atheist. Of course I believe in God, and I thank Him for
          all His mercies&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"Yes, yes," said his host. "That I shouldn't question. But a successful man's
          thanks to God are most often merely conventional. Don't think I wish to be
          offensive. I only want to get at the root of things. You are a young man,
          eight-and-twenty&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"How do you know that?" laughed Paul. </p>
        <p>"Oh, your friends have told me. You are young. You have a brilliant position.
          You have a brilliant future. Were you born to it?" </p>
        <p>There was Jane on the opposite side of the table, entirely uninterested in her
          food, looking at him in her calm, clear way. She was so wholesome, so sane, in
          her young yet mature English lower-class beauty. She had broad brows. Her mass
          of dark brown hair was rather too flawlessly arranged. He felt a second's
          irritation at not catching any playfully straying strand. She was still the Jane
          of his boyhood, but a Jane developed, a Jane from whom no secrets were hid, a
          searching, questioning and quietly disturbing Jane. </p>
        <p>"A man is born to his destiny, whatever destiny may be," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"That is Mohammedan fatalism," said Mr. Finn, "unless one means by destiny the
          guiding hand of the <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0225" n="206"/> Almighty. Do you
          believe that you're under the peculiar care of God?" </p>
        <p>"Do you, Mr. Finn?" </p>
        <p>"I have said so. I ask you. Do you?" </p>
        <p>"In a general way, yes," said Paul. "In your particular sense, no. You question
          me frankly and I answer frankly. You would not like me to answer otherwise." </p>
        <p>"Certainly not," said his host. </p>
        <p>"Then," Paul continued, with a smile, "I must say that from my childhood I have
          been fired with a curious certainty that I would succeed in life. Chance has
          helped me. How far a divine hand has been specially responsible, it isn't for me
          to conjecture. But I know that if I hadn't believed in myself I shouldn't have
          had my small measure of success." </p>
        <p>"You believe in yourself?" </p>
        <p>"Yes. And I believe in making others believe in me." </p>
        <p>"That is strange&mdash;very strange." Mr. Finn fixed him with his deep,
          sorrowful eyes. "You believe that you're predestined to a great position. You
          believe that you have in you all that is needful to attain it. That has carried
          you through. Strange!" He put his hand to his temple, elbow on table, and still
          regarded Paul. "But there's God behind it all. Mr. Savelli," he said earnestly,
          after a slight pause, "you are twenty-eight; I am fifty-eight; so I'm more than
          old enough to be your father. You'll forgive my taking up the attitude of the
          older man. I have lived a life such as your friends on the platform
          to-night&mdash;honorable, clean, sweet people&mdash;I've nothing to say
          against them&mdash;have no conception. I am English, of
          course&mdash;London born. My father was an Englishman; but my mother was a
          Sicilian. She used to go about with a barrel-organ&mdash;my father ran away
          with her. I have <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0226" n="207"/> that violent South
          in my blood, and I've lived nearly all my days in London. I've had to pay dearly
          for my blood. The only compensation it has given me is a passion for
          art"&mdash;he waved his lean, bediamonded hand towards the horrific walls.
          "That is external&mdash;in a way&mdash;mere money has enabled me to
          gratify my tastes; but, as I was saying, I have lived a life of strange
          struggle, material, physical, and"&mdash;he brought down his free hand with
          a bang on the table&mdash;"it is only by the grace of God and the
          never-ceasing presence of Our Lord Jesus Christ by my side, that&mdash;that
          I am able to offer you my modest hospitality this evening." </p>
        <p>Paul felt greatly drawn to the man. He was beyond doubt sincere. He wore the
          air of one who had lived fiercely, who had suffered, who had conquered; but the
          air of one whose victory was barren, who was looking into the void for the
          things unconquerable yet essential to salvation. Paul made a little gesture of
          attention. He could find no words to reply. A man's deep profession of faith is
          unanswerable. </p>
        <p>"Ah," said Barney Bill, "you ought to have come along o' me, Silas, years ago
          in the old 'bus. You mightn't have got all these bright pictures, but you
          wouldn't have had these 'ere gloomy ideas. I don't say as how I don't hold with
          Gawd," he explained, with uplifted forefinger and cocked head; "but if ever I
          thinks of Him, I like to feel that He's in the wind or in the crickle-crackle of
          the earth, just near and friendly like, but not a-worrying of a chap, listening
          for every cuss-word as he uses to his old horse, and measuring every half-pint
          he pours down his dusty throat. No. That ain't my idea of Gawd. But then I ain't
          got religion." </p>
        <p>"Still the same old pagan," laughed Paul. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0227"
            n="208"/>
        </p>
        <p>"No, not the same, sonny," said Barney Bill, holding up his knife, which
          supported a morsel of cheese. "Old. Rheumaticky. Got to live in a 'ouse when it
          rains&mdash;me who never keered whether I was baked to a cinder or wet
          through! I ain't a pagan no more. I'm a crock." </p>
        <p>Jane smiled affectionately at the old man, and her face was lit with rare
          sweetness when she smiled. "He really is just the same," she said. </p>
        <p>"He hasn't changed much in forty years," said Mr. Finn. </p>
        <p>"I was a good Conservative then, as I am now," said Bill. "That's one thing,
          anyhow. So was you, Silas. But you had Radical leanings." </p>
        <p>Barney Bill's remark set the talk on political lines. Paul learned that his
          host had sat for a year or more as a Progressive on the Hickney Heath Borough
          Council and aspired to a seat in Parliament. </p>
        <p>"The Kingdom of Heaven," said he, not unctuously or hypocritically, but in his
          grave tone of conviction, "is not adequately represented in the House." </p>
        <p>Paul pointed out that in the House of Lords one had the whole bench of Bishops. </p>
        <p>"I'm not a member of the Established Church, Mr. Savelli," replied Mr. Finn.
          "I'm a Dissenter&mdash;a Free Zion'st." </p>
        <p>"I've heard him conduc' the service," said Barney Bill. "He built the Meeting
          House close by, yer know. I goes sometimes to try and get converted. But I'm too
          old and stiff in the j'ints. No longer a pagan, but a crock, sonny. But I likes
          to listen to him. Gorbli&mdash;bless me, it's a real bean
          feast&mdash;that's what it is. He talks straight from the shoulder, he does,
          just as you talked to-night. Lets 'em 'ave it bing-bang in the eye. Don't he,
          Jane?" </p>
        <p>"Bill means," she explained, with the shadow of a <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0228" n="209"/> smile, for Paul's benefit, "that Mr.
          Finn is an eloquent preacher." </p>
        <p>"D'yer suppose he didn't understand what I meant Y' he exclaimed, setting down
          the beer glass which he was about to raise to his lips. "Him, what I discovered
          reading Sir Walter Scott with the cover off when he was a nipper with no clothes
          on? You understood, sonny. </p>
        <p>"Of course I did." He laughed gaily and turned to his host, who had suffered
          Barney Bill's queer eulogy with melancholy indulgence. "One of these days I
          should like to come and hear you preach." </p>
        <p>"Any Sunday, at ten and six. You would be more than welcome." </p>
        <p>The meal was over. Barney Bill pulled a blackened clay pipe from his waistcoat
          pocket and a paper of tobacco. </p>
        <p>"I'm a non-smoker," said Mr. Finn to Paul, "and I'm sorry I've nothing to offer
          you&mdash;I see little company, so I don't keep cigars in the
          house&mdash;but if you would care to smoke&mdash;" he waved a courteous
          and inviting hand. </p>
        <p>Paul whipped out his cigarette case. It was of gold&mdash;a present last
          Christmas from the Winwood fitting part of the equipment of a Fortunate Youth.
          He opened it, offered a cigarette to Barney Bill. </p>
        <p>"Garn!" said the old man. "I smokes terbakker," and he filled his pipe with
          shag. </p>
        <p>Mr. Finn rose from the table. "Will you excuse me, Mr. Savelli, if I leave you?
          I get up early to attend to my business. I must be at Billingsgate at half-past
          five to buy my fish. Besides, I have been preventing your talk with our friends.
          So pray don't go. Good-night, Mr. Savelli." </p>
        <p>As he shook hands Paul met the sorrowful liquid eyes fixed on him with strange
          earnestness. "I must <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0229" n="210"/> thank you for
          your charming hospitality. I hope you'll allow me to come and see you again." </p>
        <p>"My house is yours." </p>
        <p>It was a phrase&mdash;a phrase of Castilian politeness&mdash;oddly out
          of place in the mouth of a Free Zionist purveyor of fried fish. But it seemed to
          have more than a Castilian, more than a Free Zionist significance. He was still
          pondering over it when Mr. Finn, having bidden Jane and Barney Bill good-night,
          disappeared. </p>
        <p>"Ah!" said Barney Bill, lifting up the beer jug in order to refill his glass,
          and checked whimsically by the fact of its emptiness. "Ah," said he, setting
          down the jug and limping round the table, "let us hear as how you've been
          getting on, sonny." </p>
        <p>They drew their chairs about the great. hearth, in which the idiotic little
          Viennese plaster animals sported in movement eternally arrested, and talked of
          the years that had passed. Paul explained once more his loss of Jane and his
          fruitless efforts to find her. </p>
        <p>"We didn't know," said Jane. "We thought that either you were dead or had
          forgotten us&mdash;or had grown too big a man for us." </p>
        <p>"Axing your pardon," said Barney Bill, taking his blackened clay from his lips
          and holding it between his gnarled fingers, "you said so. I didn't. I always
          held that, if he wasn't dead, the time would come when, as it was to-night, the
          three of us would be sitting round together. I maintained," he added solemnly
          after a puff or two, "that his heart was in the right place. I'm a broken-down
          old crock, no longer a pagan; but I'm right. Ain't I, sonny?" He thrust an arm
          into the ribs of Paul, who was sitting between them. </p>
        <p>Paul looked at Jane. "I think this proves it." </p>
        <p>She returned his look steadily. "I own I was wrong. </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0230" n="Illustration"/>
        <!--<head>As he shook hands Paul met the sorrowful liquid eyes fixed on him with strange earnestness.</head>-->
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0231"/>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0232" n="211"/>
        <p>But a woman only proves herself to be right by always insisting that she is
          wrong." </p>
        <p>"My dear Jane," cried Paul. "Since when have you become so psychological?" </p>
        <p>"Gorblime," said Barney Bill, "what in thunder's that ?" </p>
        <p>"I know," said Jane. "You"&mdash;to Paul&mdash;"were good enough to
          begin my education. I've tried since to go on with it." </p>
        <p>"It's nothing to do with edication," said Barney Bill. "It's fac's. Let's have
          fac's. Jane and I have been tramping the same old high-road, but you've been
          climbing mountains&mdash;yer and yer gold cigarette cases. Let's hear about
          it." </p>
        <p>So Paul told his story, and as he told it, it seemed to him, in its
          improbability, more like a fairy-tale than the sober happenings of real life. </p>
        <p>"You've said nothing about the princess," Jane remarked, when he had ended. </p>
        <p>"The princess?" </p>
        <p>"Yes. Where does she come in?" </p>
        <p>"The Princess Zobraska is a friend of my employers." </p>
        <p>"But you and she are great friends," Jane persisted quietly. "That's obvious to
          anybody. I was standing quite close when you helped her into the motor car." </p>
        <p>"I didn't see you." </p>
        <p>"I took care you didn't. She looks charming." </p>
        <p>"Most princesses are charming&mdash;when they've no particular reason to be
          otherwise," said Paul. "It is their <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">m&#x00E9;tier</foreign>
          </hi>&mdash;their profession." </p>
        <p>There was a little silence. Jane, cheek on hand, looked thoughtfully into the
          fire. Barney Bill knocked' the ashes out of his pipe and thrust it in his
          pocket. "It's getting late, sonny." </p>
        <p>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0233" n="212"/> Paul looked at his watch. It was past
          one o'clock. He jumped up. "I hope to goodness you haven't to begin work at
          half-past five," he said to Jane. </p>
        <p>"No. At eight." She rose as he stretched out his hand. "You don't know what it
          is to see you again, Paul. I can't tell you. Some things are upsetting. But I'm
          glad. Oh, yes, I'm glad, Paul dear. Don't think I'm not." </p>
        <p>Her voice broke a little. They were the first gentle words she had given him
          all the evening. Paul smiled and kissed her hand as he had kissed that of the
          princess, and, still holding it, said: "Don't I know you of old? And if you
          suppose I haven't thought of you and felt the need of you, you're very much
          mistaken. Now I've found you, I'm not going to let you go again." </p>
        <p>She turned her head aside and looked down; there was the slightest movement of
          her plump shoulders. "What's the good? I can't do anything for you now, and you
          can't do anything for me. You're on the way to becoming a great man. To me,
          you're a great man already. Don't you see?" </p>
        <p>"My dear, I was an embryonic Shelley, Raphael, Garrick, and Napoleon when you
          first met me," he said jestingly. </p>
        <p>"But then you didn't belong to their&mdash;to their sphere. Now you do.
          Your friends are lords and ladies and&mdash;and princesses&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"My friends," cried Paul, "are people with great true hearts&mdash;like the
          Winwoods&mdash;and the princess, if you like&mdash;and you, and Barney
          Bill." </p>
        <p>"That's a sentiment as does you credit," said the old man. "Great true hearts!
          Now if you ain't satisfied, my dear, you're a damn criss-cross female. And yer
          ain't, are yer?' She laughed and Paul laughed. The little spell of <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0234" n="213"/> intensity was broken. There were
          pleasant leave-takings. </p>
        <p>"I'll set you on your road a bit," said Barney Bill. "I live in the
          neighbourhood. Good-bye, Jane." </p>
        <p>She went with them to the front door, and stood in the gusty air watching them
          until they melted into the darkness.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XIV</head>

        <p>BETWEEN the young man of immaculate vesture, of impeccable manners, of
          undeniable culture, of instinctive sympathy with the great world where great
          things are done, of unerring tact, of mythological beauty and charm, of
          boundless ambition, of resistless energy, of incalculable promise, in outer
          semblance and in avowed creed the fine flower of aristocratic England,
          professing the divine right of the House of Lords and the utilitarian sanctity
          of the Church of England&mdash;between Paul, that is to say, and the
          Radical, progressive councillor of Hickney Heath, the Free Zionist dissenter
          (not even Congregationalist or Baptist or Wesleyan, or any powerfully organized
          Non-conformist whose conscience archbishops consult with astute patronage), the
          purveyor of fried fish, the man of crude, uncultivated taste, there should have
          been a gulf fixed as wide as the Pacific Ocean. As a matter of fact, whatever
          gulf lay between them was narrow enough to be bridged comfortably over by mutual
          esteem. Paul took to visiting Mr. Finn. Accustomed to the somewhat tired or
          conventional creeds of his political world, he found refreshment in the man's
          intense faith. He also found pathetic attraction in the man's efforts towards
          self-expression. Mr. Finn, who lived a life of great
          loneliness&mdash;scarcely a soul, said Jane, crossed his threshold from
          month's end to month's end&mdash;seemed delighted to have a sympathetic
          visitor to whom he could display his painted <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0236"
            n="215"/> treasures. When he was among them the haunting pain vanished from
          his eyes, as sometimes one has seen it vanish from those of an unhappy woman
          among her flowers. He loved to take Paul through his collection and point out
          the beauties and claim his admiration. He had converted a conservatory running
          along one side of the house into a picture gallery, and this was filled with his
          masterpieces of pictorial villainy. Here Paul was at first astonished at
          recognizing replicas of pictures which hung in other rooms. Mr. Finn explained. </p>
        <p>"These," said he, "are the originals." </p>
        <p>Paul pondered over the dark saying for a moment or two until he came upon a
          half-finished canvas on an easel. It was the copy of a landscape on the wall. He
          turned questioningly to his host. The latter smiled. </p>
        <p>"I'm a bit of an artist myself," he said. "But as I've never had time for
          lessons in painting, I teach myself by copying good pictures. It's a
          Saunders"&mdash;a name unknown to Paul&mdash;"and a very good example.
          It's called Noontide. The cow is particularly good, isn't it? But it's
          exceedingly difficult. That fore-shortening&mdash;I can't get it quite right
          yet. But I go on and on till I succeed. The only way." </p>
        <p>Paul acquiesced and asked him where he had picked up his Saunders. Indeed,
          where had he picked up all the others? Not an exhibition in London would have
          admitted one of them. This "Saunders" represented a wooden cow out of drawing
          lying in the shade of a conventional tree. It was peculiarly bad. </p>
        <p>"I bought it direct from the artist," replied Mr. Finn. "He's an unrecognized
          genius, and now he's getting old, poor fellow. Years ago he offended the Royal
          Academy, and they never forgot it. He says they've kept him under all his life.
          I have a great many of his pictures." He looked admiringly at the <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0237" n="216"/> cow for a while, and added: "I gave him
          four pounds ten for this one." </p>
        <p>Paul could not forbear saying, though his tone betrayed no irony: "A good
          price." </p>
        <p>"I think so," replied Mr. Finn. "That's what he asked. I could never haggle
          with an artist. His work is of the spirit, isn't it ?" </p>
        <p>And Paul marvelled at the childlike simplicity of the man, the son of the
          Sicilian woman who went about with a barrel-organ, who, starting in the race on
          a level with Barney Bill, had made a fortune in the exploitation of fried fish.
          To disturb his faith in the genius of Saunders were a crime&mdash;as base a
          crime as proving to a child the non-existence of fairies. For Paul saw that
          Silas Finn found in this land of artistic illusion a refuge from many things;
          not only from the sordid cares of a large business, but perhaps also from the
          fierce intensity of his religion, from his driving and compelling deity. Here
          God entered gently. </p>
        <p>There was another reason, which Paul scarcely confessed to himself, for the
          pleasure he found in the older man's company. The veil which he had thrown so
          adroitly over his past history, which needed continuous adroitness to maintain,
          was useless in this house. Both Barney Bill and Jane had spoken of him freely.
          Silas Finn knew of Bludston, of his modeldom, of his inglorious career on the
          stage. He could talk openly once more, without the never-absent subconscious
          sense of reserve. He was still, in his own ,eyes, the prince out of the
          fairy-tale; but Silas Finn and the two others alone of his friends shared the
          knowledge of the days when he herded swine. Now a prince out of a fairy-tale who
          has herded swine is a romantic figure. Paul did not doubt that he was one. Even
          Jane, in spite of her direct common sense, admitted it. Barney Bill proclaimed
          it openly, slapping <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0238" n="217"/> him on the back
          and taking much credit to himself for helping the prince on the way to his
          kingdom. And Mr. Finn, even in the heat of political discussion or theological
          asseveration, treated him with a curious and pathetic deference. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile Paul pursued his own career of glory. The occasional visits to
          Hickney Heath were, after all, but rare, though distinct, episodes in his busy
          life. He had his parliamentary work for Colonel Winwood, his work for Miss
          Winwood, his work for the Young England League. He had his social engagements.
          He had the Princess Zobraska. He also began to write, in picturesque advocacy of
          his views, for serious weekly and monthly publications. Then Christmas came and
          lie found himself at Drane's Court, somewhat gasping for breath. A large
          houseparty, however, including Lord Francis Ayres, the chief Opposition Whip,
          threatened to keep him busy. </p>
        <p>The Princess drove over from Chetwood Park for dinner on Christmas Day. He had
          to worship from afar; for a long spell of the evening to worship with horrible
          jealousy. Lord Francis Ayres, a bachelor and a man of winning charm, as men must
          be whose function it is to keep Members of Parliament good and pleased with
          themselves and sheeplike, held the Princess captive, in a remote corner, with
          his honeyed tongue. She looked at him seductively out of her great, slumberous
          blue eyes, even as she had looked, on occasion, at him, Paul. He hated Lord
          Francis, set himself up against him, as of old he had set himself up against
          Billy Goodge. He was a better man than Frank Ayres. Frank Ayres was only a
          popinjay. Beneath the tails of his coat he snapped his fingers at Frank Ayres,
          while he listened, with his own agreeable smile, to Mademoiselle de Cressy's
          devilled gossip. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0239" n="218"/>
        </p>
        <p>He was very frigid and courtly when he bade the Princess good night at the door
          of her limousine. </p>
        <p>"Ah, <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">que vous &#x00EA;tes b&#x00EA;te</foreign>
          </hi>!" she laughed. </p>
        <p>He went to bed very angry. She had told him to his face that he was a silly
          fool. And so he was. He thought of all the brilliantly dignified things he might
          have said, if the relentless engine had not whirred her away down the drive. But
          the next morning Lord Francis met him in the wintry garden and smiled and held
          out a winning hand. Paul hid his hatred beneath the mask of courtesy. They
          talked for a few moments of indifferent matters. Then Frank Ayres suddenly said:
          "Have you ever thought of standing for Parliament?" </p>
        <p>Paul, who had been sauntering between flowerless beds with his companion, stood
          stock still. The Chief Whip of a political party is a devil of a fellow. To the
          aspiring young politician he is much more a devil of a fellow than the Prime
          Minister or any Secretary of State. If a Chief Whip breathes the suggestion that
          a man might possibly stand for election as a Member of Parliament, it means that
          at any suitable vacancy, or at a general election, be will, with utter
          certainty, have his chance as a candidate with the whole force of his party
          behind him. It is part of the business of Chief Whips to find candidates. </p>
        <p>"Of course," said Paul, rather stupidly. "Eventually. One of these days." </p>
        <p>"But soon?" </p>
        <p>"Soon?" </p>
        <p>Paul's head reeled. What did he mean by soon? "Well," Lord Francis laughed,
          "not to-morrow. But pretty soon. Look here, Savelli. I'm going to speak frankly.
          The party's in for a long period out of office. That's obvious. Look at the
          majority against us. We want the young blood&mdash;not the old
          hacks&mdash;so that <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0240" n="219"/> when we come
          in again we shall have a band of trained men in the heyday of their powers. Of
          course I know&mdash;it's my business to know&mdash;what generally you
          have done for the Young England League, but I missed your speech at Flickney
          Heath in the autumn. You had an immense success, hadn't you?" </p>
        <p>"They seemed pleased with what I had to say," replied Paul modestly. "When did
          you hear about it?" </p>
        <p>"Last night." </p>
        <p>"The Winwoods are the dearest people in the world," said Paul, walking warily,
          "but they are prejudiced in my favour." </p>
        <p>"It wasn't the Winwoods." </p>
        <p>The beautiful truth flashed upon Paul. </p>
        <p>"Then it was the Princess Zobraska." </p>
        <p>The other laughed. "Never mind. I know all about it. It isn't often one has to
          listen to speeches at second-hand. The question is: Would you care to stand when
          the time comes?" </p>
        <p>"I should just think I would," cried Paul boyishly. </p>
        <p>All his jealous resentment had given place to exultation. It was the Princess
          who had told Frank Ayres. If she had been laying him under the spell of her
          seduction it was on his, Paul's, account. She had had the splendid audacity to
          recite his speech to the Chief Whip. Frank Ayres was suddenly transformed from a
          popinjay into an admirable fellow. The Princess herself sat enthroned more
          adorable than ever. </p>
        <p>"The only difficulty," said Paul, "is that I have to earn my living." </p>
        <p>"That might be arranged," said Lord Francis. </p>
        <p>So Paul, as soon as he found an opportunity, danced over to Chetwood Park and
          told his Princess all about it, and called her a tutelary goddess and an angel
          and all manner of pretty names. And the Princess, who was alone, poured for him
          her priceless Russian tea <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0241" n="220"/> into
          egg-shell China tea-cups and fed him on English crumpets, and, in her French and
          feminine way, gave him the outer fringe of her heart to play with&mdash;a
          very dangerous game. She had received him, not as once before in the state
          drawing room, but in the intimacy of her own boudoir, a place all soft lights
          and cushions and tapestries and gleaming bits of sculpture. After tea and
          crumpets had been consumed, the dangerous game proceeded far enough for Paul to
          confess his unjust dislike of Frank Ayres. </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">"Gros jaloux,"</foreign>
          </hi> said the Princess. </p>
        <p>"That was why you said <hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="fr">que vous
              &#x00EA;tes b&#x00EA;te,</foreign>"</hi> said he. </p>
        <p>"Partly." </p>
        <p>"What were the other reasons?" </p>
        <p>"Any woman has a thousand reasons for calling any man stupid." </p>
        <p>"Tell me some of them at any rate." </p>
        <p>"Well, isn't it stupid of a man to try to quarrel with his best friend when he
          won't be seeing her again for three or four months?" </p>
        <p>"You're not going away soon?" </p>
        <p>"Next week." </p>
        <p>"Ohl" said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Yes. I go to Paris, then to my villa at Mont Boron. I have the nostalgia of my
          own country, you see. Then to Venice at Easter." </p>
        <p>I Paul looked at her wistfully, for life seemed suddenly very blank and dismal.
          "What shall I do all that time without my best friend?" </p>
        <p>"You will probably find another and forget her." </p>
        <p>She was lying back among cushions, pink and terra-cotta, and a round black
          cushion framed her delicate head. </p>
        <p>Paul said in a low voice, bending forward: "Do you think you are a woman whom
          men forget?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0242" n="221"/>
        </p>
        <p>Their eyes met. The game had grown very perilous. "Men may remember the
          princess," she replied, "but forget the woman." </p>
        <p>"If it weren't for the woman inside the princess; what reason should I have for
          remembering?" he asked. </p>
        <p>She fenced. "But, as it is, you don't see me very often." </p>
        <p>"I know. But you are here&mdash;to be seen&mdash;not when I want you,
          for that would be every hour of the day&mdash;but, at least, in times of
          emergency. You are here, all the same, in the atmosphere of my life." </p>
        <p>"And if I go abroad I shall no longer be in that atmosphere? Did I not say you
          would forget?" </p>
        <p>She laughed. Then quickly started forward, and, elbow on knee and chin on palm,
          regarded him brightly. "We are talking like a couple of people out of
          Mademoiselle de Scud&#x00E9;ry," she said before he had time to reply. "And
          we are in the twentieth century, <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">mon pauvre ami</foreign>
          </hi>. We must be sensible. I know that you will miss me. And I will miss you
          too. <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">Mais que voulez-vous?</foreign>
          </hi> We have to obey the laws of the world we live in." </p>
        <p>"Need we?" asked Paul daringly. "Why need we?" </p>
        <p>"We must. I must go away to my own country. You must stay in yours and work and
          fulfill your ambitions." She paused. "I want you to be a great man," she said,
          with a strange tenderness in her voice. </p>
        <p>"With you by my side," said he, "I feel I could conquer the earth." </p>
        <p>"As your good friend I shall always be by your side. <hi rend="italic"><foreign
              lang="fr">Vous voyez, mon cher Paul,</foreign>"</hi> she went on quickly in
          French. "I am not quite as people see me. I am a woman who is lonely and not too
          happy, who has had disillusions which have embittered her life. You know my
          history. It is public property. But I <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0243" n="222"/>
          am young. And my heart is healed&mdash;and it craves faith and tenderness
          and&mdash;and friendship. I have many to flatter me. I am not too ugly. Many
          men pay their court to me, but they do not touch my heart. None of them even
          interest me. I don't know why. And then I have my rank, which imposes on me its
          obligations. Sometimes I wish I were a little woman of nothing at all, so that I
          could do as I like. <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">Mais enfin,</foreign>
          </hi> I do what I can. You have come, Paul Savelli, with your youth and your
          faith and your genius, and you pay your court to me like the others. Yes, it is
          true&mdash;and as long as it was amusing, I let it go on. But now that you
          interest me, it is different. I want your success. I want it with all my heart.
          It is a little something in my life&mdash;I confess it&mdash;<hi
            rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">quelque chose de tr&#x00E8;s joli</foreign>
          </hi>&mdash;and I will not spoil it. So let us be good friends, frank and
          loyal&mdash;without any Scud&#x00E9;ry." She looked at him with eyes
          that had lost their languor&mdash;a sweet woman's eyes, a little moist, very
          true. "And now," she said, "will you be so kind as to put a log on the fire." </p>
        <p>Paul rose and threw a log on the glowing embers, and stood by her side. He was
          deeply moved. Never before had she so spoken. Never before had she afforded a
          glimpse of the real woman. Her phrases, so natural, so sincere, in her own
          tongue, and so caressive, stirred the best in him. The glamour passed from the
          royal lady; only the sweet and beautiful woman remained. </p>
        <p>"I will be what you will, my Princess," he said. </p>
        <p>At that moment he could not say more. For the first time in his life he was
          mute in a woman's presence; and the reason was that for the first time in his
          life love for a woman had gripped his heart. </p>
        <p>She rose and smiled at him. <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">"Bons amis, francs et loyaux?"</foreign>
          </hi>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0244" n="223"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">"Francs et loyaux."</foreign>
          </hi>

        </p>
        <p>She gave him her hand in friendship; but she gave him her eyes in love. It is
          the foolish way of women. </p>
        <p>"May a frank and loyal friend write to you sometimes?" he asked. </p>
        <p>"Why, yes. And a frank and loyal friend will answer." </p>
        <p>"And when shall I see you again?" </p>
        <p>"Did I not tell you," she said, moving to the bell, for this was
          leave-taking&mdash;"that I shall be in Venice at Easter?" </p>
        <p>Paul went out into the frosty air, and the bright wintry stars shone down on
          him. Often on such nights he had looked up, wondering which was his star, the
          star that guided his destiny. But to-night no such fancy crossed his mind. He
          did not think of the stars. He did not think of his destiny. His mind and soul
          were drenched in thought of one woman. It had come at last, the great passion,
          the infinite desire. It had come in a moment, wakened into quivering being by
          the caressive notes of the dear French voice&mdash;<hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">"mais je suis jeune, et mon coeur est gu&#x00E9;ri, et

          </hi> all but her lips said <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">amour</foreign>
          </hi>. He walked beneath the wintry stars, a man in a perfect dream. </p>
        <p>Till then she had been but his Princess, the exquisite lady whom it had amused
          to wander with him into the <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">pays du tendre</foreign>
          </hi>. She had been as far above him as the now disregarded stars. She had come
          down with a carnival domino over her sidereal raiment, and had met him on
          carnival equality. <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">H&#x00E9; beau masque!</foreign>
          </hi> He, knowing her, had fallen beneath her starry spell. He was Paul
          Kegworthy, Paul Savelli, what you like; Paul the adventurer, Paul the man born
          to great <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0245" n="224"/> things. She was a beautiful
          woman, bearing the title of Princess, the title that had haunted his life since
          first the Vision Splendid dawned upon him as he lay on his stomach eavesdropping
          and heard the words of the divinely-smelling goddess who had given him his
          talisman, the cornelian heart. To "rank himself with princes" had been the
          intense meaning of his life since ragged and fiercely imaginative childhood. Odd
          circumstances had ranked him with Sophie Zobraska. The mere romance of it had
          carried him off his feet. She was a princess. She was charming. She frankly
          liked his society. She seemed interested in his adventurous career. She was
          romantic. He too. She was his Egeria. He had worshipped her romantically, in a
          medi&aelig;val, Italian way, and she had accepted the homage. It had all
          been deliciously artificial. It had all been Mademoiselle de Scud&#x00E9;ry.
          But to-day the real woman, casting off her carnival domino, casting off too the
          sidereal raiment, had spoken, for the first time, in simple womanhood, and her
          betraying eyes had told things that they had told to no other man living or
          dead. And all that was artificial, all that was fantastic, all that was glamour,
          was stripped away from Paul in the instant of her self-revelation. He loved her
          as man loves woman. He laughed aloud as his young feet struck the frozen road.
          She knew and was not angry. She, in her wonder, gave him leave to love her. It
          was obvious that she loved him to love her. Dear God! He could go on loving her
          like this for the rest of his life. What more did he want? To the clean man of
          nine-and-twenty, sufficient for the day is the beauty thereof. </p>
        <p>An inspired youth took his place at the Winwoods' dinner table that evening.
          The elderly, ugly heiress, Miss Durning, concerning whom Miss Winwood had, with
          gentle malice, twitted him some months before, sat <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0246" n="225"/> by his side. He sang her songs of Araby
          and tales of far Cashmere&mdash;places which in the commonplace way of
          travel he had never visited. What really happened in the drawing room between
          the departure of the ladies and the entrance of the men no one knows. But before
          the ladies went to bed Miss Winwood took Paul aside. </p>
        <p>"Paul dear," she said, "you're never going to marry an old woman for money, are
          you?" </p>
        <p>"Good God, no! Dearest lady, what do you mean?" </p>
        <p>His cry was so sincere that she laughed. </p>
        <p>"Nothing," she said. </p>
        <p>"But you must mean something." He threw out his hands. </p>
        <p>"Are you aware that you've been flirting disgracefully with Lizzle Durning?" </p>
        <p>"I?" said Paul, clapping a hand to his shirt-front. </p>
        <p>"You." </p>
        <p>He smiled his sunny smile into the clear, direct eyes of his dearest
          lady&mdash;all the more dear because of the premature white of her hair. "I
          would flirt to-night with Xantippe, or Kerenhappuch, or Queen Victoria," said
          he. </p>
        <p>"Why?" </p>
        <p>He laughed, and although none of the standing and lingering company had
          overheard them, he gently led her to the curtained embrasure of the drawing-room
          window. </p>
        <p>"This is perhaps the biggest day of my life. I've not had an opportunity of
          telling you. This morning Frank Ayres offered me a seat in Parliament." </p>
        <p>"I'm glad," said Ursula Winwood; but her eyes hardened. "And
          so&mdash;Lizzie Durning&mdash;" </p>
        <p>He took both her elbows in his hands&mdash;only a Fortunate Youth, with his
          laughing charm, would have dared to grip Ursula Winwood's elbows and cut her <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0247" n="226"/> short. "Dearest lady," said he, "to-day
          there are but two women in the world for me. You are one. The
          other&mdash;well&mdash;it isn't Miss Durning." </p>
        <p>She searched him through and through, "This afternoon ?" </p>
        <p>"Yes." </p>
        <p>"Paul!" She withdrew from his grasp. In her voice was a touch of reproach. </p>
        <p>"Dearest lady," said he, "I would die rather than marry a rich woman, ugly or
          beautiful, if I could not bring her something big in return&mdash;something
          worth living for." </p>
        <p>"You've fold me either too much or too little. Am I not entitled to know how
          things stand?" </p>
        <p>"You're entitled to know the innermost secrets of my heart," he cried; and he
          told thereof as far as his love for the Princess was concerned. </p>
        <p>"But, my poor boy," said Ursula tenderly, "how is it all going to end?" </p>
        <p>"It's never going to end," cried Paul. </p>
        <p>Ursula Winwood smiled on him and sighed a little; for she remembered the
          gallant young fellow who had been killed in the Soudan in eighteen
          eighty-five.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XV</head>

        <p>IT would never end. Why should it? Could a Great Wonder be merely a transient
          thrill? Absurd. Dawn followed night, day after day, and the wonder had not
          faded. It would never fade. Letter followed letter, each more precious than the
          last. </p>
        <p>She began with "Mon cher Paul." Then "Mon cher," then sometimes "Paul." She set
          the tone of the frank and loyal friendship in a style very graceful, very
          elusive, a word of tenderness melting away in a laugh; she took the friendship,
          pulled it to pieces and reconstructed it in ideal form; then she tied blue
          ribbon round its neck, and showed him how beautiful it was. She sat on the
          veranda of her villa and looked' out on the moonlit Mediterranean and wanted to
            cry&mdash;<hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">J'avais enbie de
              Pleurer</foreign>"</hi>&mdash;because she was all alone, having
          entertained at dinner a heap of dull and ugly people. She had spent a day on the
          yacht of a Russiarr Grand-Duke. <hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">Il m'a
              fait une cour effr&#x00E9;n&#x00E9;e</foreign>"</hi>&mdash;Paul
          thirsted immediately for the blood of this Grand-Duke, who had dared to make
          violent love to her. But when, a few lines farther on, he found that she had
          guessed his jealousy and laughed at it, he laughed too. "Don't be afraid. I have
          had enough of these people." She wanted <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">une &#x00E2;me sinc&#x00E8;re et candide</foreign>
          </hi>; and Paul laid the flattering unction to his own sincere and candid soul.
          Then she spoke prettily of his career. He was to be the <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">flambeau &#x00E9;veilleur</foreign>
          </hi>, the awakening torch in the darkness before the daybreak. But he musn't
          overwork. His health was precious. There was a blot <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0249" n="228"/> and erasure in the sentence. He took
          the letter to the light, lover-wise, and looked at it through a magnifying
          glass&mdash;and his pulses thrilled when it told him that she had originally
          written, <hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">Votre sant&#x00E9; m'est
              precieuse,</foreign>"</hi> and had scrabbled out the <hi rend="italic"
              >"<foreign lang="fr">m.</foreign>"</hi> "Your health is precious to me."
          That is what her heart had said. Did lover ever have a dearer mistress? He
          kissed the blot, and the thick French ink coming off on his lips was nectar. </p>
        <p>And he began his letters with "My dear Princess;" then it was "Dearest
          Princess;" then "My Princess." Then she rallied him on the matter. It came to
            <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">"Mais enfin j'ai un petit nom comme tout le
              monde."</foreign>
          </hi> In common with the rest of humanity she had a Christian name&mdash;and
          she was accustomed to be called by it by her frank and loyal friends. "And they
          are so few." Paul heard the delicate little sigh and saw the delicate rise and
          fall of the white bosom. And again he fed on purple ink. So he began his next
          letter with "Dear Sophie." But he could not pour the same emotion into "Dear
          Sophie" as he could into "My Princess"&mdash;and "My Sophie" was a step
          beyond the bounds of frank and loyal friendship. So it came to his
          apostrophizing her as "Dear" and scattering "Sophies" deliciously through the
          text. And so the frank and loyal friendship went on its appointed course, as
          every frank and loyal friendship between two young and ardent souls who love
          each other has proceeded since the beginning of a sophisticated world. </p>
        <p>The first three months of that year were a period of enchantment. He lived
          supremely. The daily round of work was trivial play. He rose at seven, went to
          bed at two, crowded the nineteen hours of wakefulness with glorious endeavour.
          He went all over the country with his <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">flambeau &#x00E9;veilleur,</foreign>
          </hi> awakening the Youth of England, finding at last the great <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0250" n="229"/> artistic gift the gods had given him,
          the gift of oratory. One day he reminded Jane of a talk long ago when he had
          fled from the studios: "You asked me how I was going to earn my living. I said I
          was going to follow one of the Arts." </p>
        <p>"I remember," said Jane, regarding him full-eyed. "You said you thought you
          were a poet&mdash; but you might be a musician or painter. Finally you
          decided you were an actor." </p>
        <p>He laughed his gay laugh. "I was an infernally bad actor," he acknowledged. </p>
        <p>Then he explained his failure on the stage. He was impatient of other people's
          inventions, wanting to play not Hamlet or Tom or Dick or Romeo or Harry, but
          himself. Now he could play himself. It was acting in a way. Anyhow it was an
          Art; so his boyish prophecy had come true. He had been struggling from childhood
          for a means of self-expression. He had tried most of them save this. Here he had
          found it. He loved to play upon a crowd as if they were so many notes of a vast
          organ. </p>
        <p>On this occasion Jane said: "And my means of self-expression is to play on the
          keys of a typewriter." </p>
        <p>"Your time hasn't come," he replied. "When you have found your means you will
          express yourself all the more greatly." </p>
        <p>Which was ingenious on the part of Paul, but ironically consoling to Jane. </p>
        <p>One week-end during the session he spent at the Marchioness of Chudley's place
          in Lancashire. He drove in a luxurious automobile through the stately park,
          which once he had traversed in the brakeful of urchins, the raggedest of them
          all, and his heart swelled with pardonable exultation. He had passed through
          Bludston and he had caught a glimpse of what had once been his brickfield, now
          the site of more rows <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0251" n="230"/> of mean little
          houses, and he had seen the grim factory chimneys still smoking, smoking. . . .
          The little Buttons, having grown up into big Buttons, were toiling away their
          lives in those factories. And Button himself, the unspeakable Button? Was he yet
          alive? And Mrs. Button, who had been Polly Kegworthy and called herself his
          mother? It was astonishing how seldom he thought of her. . . . He had run away a
          scarecrow boy in a gipsy van. He came back a formative force in the land, the
          lover of a princess, the honoured guest of the great palace of the countryside.
          He slipped his hand into his waistcoat pocket and felt the cornelian heart. </p>
        <p>Yes, in the great palace he found himself an honoured guest. His name was known
          independently of his work for the Winwoods. He was doing good service to his
          party. The word had gone abroad&mdash;perhaps Frank Ayres had kindly spoken
          it&mdash;that he was the coming man. Lady Chudley said: "I wonder if you
          remember what we talked about when I first met you." </p>
        <p>Paul laughed, for she did not refer to the first meeting of all. "I'm afraid I
          was very young and fatuous," said he. "It was years ago. I hadn't grown up." </p>
        <p>"Never mind. We talked about waking the country from its sleep." </p>
        <p>"And you gave me a phrase, Lady Chudley&mdash;'the Awakener of England.' It
          stuck. It crystallized all sorts of vague ambitions. I've never forgotten it for
          five consecutive minutes. But how can you remember a casual act of graciousness
          to an unimportant boy?" </p>
        <p>"No boy who dreams of England's greatness is unimportant," she said. "You've
          proved me to be right. Your dreams are coming true&mdash;see, I don't
          forget!" <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0252" n="231"/>
        </p>
        <p>"I owe you far more than you could possibly imagine," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"No, no. Don't. Don't exaggerate. A laughing phrase&mdash;that's nothing." </p>
        <p>"It is something. Even a great deal. But it's not all," said he. </p>
        <p>"What else is there?" </p>
        <p>"You were one of the two or three," he said earnestly, thinking of the Bludston
          factory, "who opened new horizons for me." </p>
        <p>"I'm a proud woman," said Lady Chudley. </p>
        <p>The next day, Sunday, old Lord Chudley dragged him into his own private den. He
          had a very red, battered, clean-shaven face and very red hair and side whiskers;
          and he was a very honest gentleman, believing implicitly in God and the King and
          the House of Lords, and Foxes, and the Dutch School of Painting, and his
          responsibility as a great landowner toward the two or three thousand human
          beings with whom he had business relations. </p>
        <p>"Look here, Savelli. I've looked into your League. It's a damned good thing.
          About the only thing that has been invented which can stem the tide of
          Socialism. Catch 'em young. That's the way. But you want the sinews of war. You
          get subscriptions, but not enough; I've seen your last balance sheet. You want a
          little army of&mdash;what the devil shall we call 'em?" </p>
        <p>"Big Englanders," Paul suggested at a venture. </p>
        <p>"Good. We want an army of 'em to devote their whole time to the work. Open a
          special fund. You and Ursula Winwood will know how to work it. What Ursula
          Winwood doesn't know in this sort of business isn't worth knowing&mdash;and
          here's something to head the list with." </p>
        <p>And he handed Paul a cheque, which after a dazed <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0253" n="232"/> second or two he realized to be one for
          five thousand pounds. </p>
        <p>That was the beginning of the financial prosperity and the real political
          importance of the Young England League. Paul organized a great public dinner
          with the Leader of the Opposition in the chair and an amazing band of notables
          around the tables. Speeches were made, the Marquis of Chudley's patriotism
          extolled, and subscription lists filled up and handed to a triumphant organizing
          secretary. </p>
        <p>A powerful daily newspaper took up the cause and made strong appeal. The Lodges
          made simultaneous efforts in their respective districts. Money flowed into the
          League's coffers. </p>
        <p>When Parliament rose for the Easter recess Paul, the most tired, yet the most
          blissful, youth among the Fortunate, flew straight to Venice, where a happy-eyed
          princess welcomed him. She was living in a Palazzo on the Grand Canal, lent to
          her&mdash;that is the graceful Italian way of putting it&mdash;by some
          Venetian friends; and there, with Mademoiselle de Cressy to keep off the
          importunate, she received such acquaintance as floated from the ends of the
          earth through the enchanted city. </p>
        <p>"I have started by seeing as few people as I can," she said. "That's all on
          account of you, monsieur." </p>
        <p>He pressed her hand. "I hope we don't see a single soul we know as long as I'm
          here," he declared. </p>
        <p>His hope was gratified, not completely, but enough to remove grounds for
          lover's fretfulness. He passed idyllic days in halcyon weather. Often she would
          send her gondola to fetch him from the Grand Hotel, where he was staying. Now
          and then, most graciously audacious of princesses, she would come herself. On
          such occasions he would sit awaiting her with beating <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0254" n="233"/> heart, <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="la">juvenis fortunatus nimium,</foreign>
          </hi> on the narrow veranda of the hotel, regardless of the domed white pile of
          Santa Maria della Salute opposite, or the ceaseless life on the water, or the
          sunshine, or anything else in Venice, his gaze fixed on the bend of the canal;
          and then at last would appear the tall curved prow, and then the white-clad,
          red-sashed Giacomo bending to his oar, and then the white tenda with the dear
          form beneath, vaguely visible, and then Felipe, clad like Giacomo and bending,
          too, rhythmically with the foremost figure. Slowly, all too slowly, the gondola
          would near the steps, and beneath the tenda would smile the dearest face in the
          world, and the cheeks would be delicately flushed and the eyes tender and
          somewhat shy. And Paul would stand, smiling too, a conquering young figure with
          green Marienbad hat tilted with ever so tiny a shade of jauntiness, the object
          of frankly admiring and curious glances from a lone woman or two on the veranda,
          until the gondola was brought up to the wave-washed steps, and the hotel porter
          had fixed the bridge of plank. Then, with Giacomo supporting his elbow, he would
          board the black craft and would creep under the tenda and sink on the low seat
          by her side with a sense of daring and delicious intimacy, and the gondola would
          glide away into fairyland. </p>
        <p>"Let us be real tourists and do Venice thoroughly," she had said. "I have never
          seen it properly." </p>
        <p>"But you've been here many times before." </p>
        <p>"Yes. But&mdash;" </p>
        <p>She hesitated. </p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">"Eh bien?"</foreign>
          </hi>

          </hi>

        </p>
        <p>"Will you forgive me if I guess right? Our great Shakespeare says: 'Love lends
          a precious seeing to the eye.' " <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0255" n="234"/>
        </p>
        <p>"That&mdash;that's very pretty," said the Princess in French. "I love much
          your Shakespeare." </p>
        <p>Whereupon Paul recognized her admission of the correctness of his conjecture;
          and so, with the precious vision they had borrowed, they went about tourist-wise
          to familiar churches and palaces, and everything they saw was lit with exceeding
          loveliness. And they saw the great pictures of the world, and Paul, with his
          expert knowledge, pointed out beauties she had not dreamed of hitherto, and told
          her tales of the painters and discoursed picturesquely on Venetian history, and
          she marvelled at his insight and learning and thought him the most wonderful man
          that had ever dropped ' ready-made, from heaven. And he, in the flush of his new
          love, was thrilled by her touch and the low tones of her voice when she plucked
          him by the sleeve and murmured: <hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">Ah, Paul,
              regardez-moi &#x00E7;a.</foreign></hi> It is so beautiful one wants to
          weep with joy." </p>
        <p>They spoke now half in French, half in English, and she no longer protested
          against his murderous accent, which, however, lie strove to improve. Love must
          have lent its precious hearing too, for she vowed she loved to hear him speak
          her language. </p>
        <p>In the great Council Chamber of the Ducal Palace they looked at the seventy-six
          portraits of the illustrious succession of Doges&mdash;with the one tragic
          vacant space, the missing portrait of Marino Faliero, the Rienzi of Venice, the
          man before his time. </p>
        <p>"It seizes one's heart, doesn't it ?" said the Princess, with her impulsive
          touch on his sleeve. "All these men were kings&mdash;sovereigns of a mighty
          nation. And how like they are to one another&mdash;in this essential quality
          one would say they were brothers of a great family." </p>
        <p>"Why, yes," he cried, scanning the rows of severe and subtle faces. "It's true.
          Illuminatingly true."</p>

        <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0256" n="Illustration"/>
        <!--<head>And the gondola would glide away into fairyland</head>-->
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0257"/>

        <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0258" n="235"/>

        <p>He slid up his wrist quickly so that his hand met hers; he held it. "How swift
          your perception is! And what is that quality&mdash;that quality common to
          them all&mdash;that quality of leadership? Let us try to find it." </p>
        <p>Unconsciously he gripped her hand, and she returned his pressure; and they
          stood, as chance willed it, alone, free from circumambulant tourists, in the
          vast chamber, vivid with Paul Veronese's colour on wall and ceilings, with
          Tintoretto and Bassano' with the arrogant splendour of the battles and the pomp
          and circumstance of victorious armies of the proud and conquering republic, and
          their eyes were drawn from all this painted and riotous wonder by the long
          arresting frieze of portraits of serene, masterful and subtle faces. </p>
        <p>"The common factor&mdash;that's what we want, isn't it ?" </p>
        <p>"Yes," she breathed. </p>
        <p>And as they stood, hand in hand, the unspoken thought vibrating between them,
          the memory came to him of a day long ago when he had stood with another
          woman&mdash;a girl then&mdash;before the photographs in the window of
          the London Stereoscopic Company in Regent Street, and he had scanned faces of
          successful men. He laughed&mdash;he could not help it&mdash;and drew his
          Princess closer to him. Between the analogous then and the wonderful now, how
          immense a difference! As he laughed she looked swiftly up into his face. </p>
        <p>"I know why you laugh." </p>
        <p>"No, my Princess. Impossible." </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">Mais oui.</foreign></hi> Tell me. All
          these great princes"&mdash;she swept her little gloved hand toward the
          frieze. "What is their common factor?" </p>
        <p>Paul, forgetful of his mirth, looked round. "'Indomitable will," said be
          seriously. "Unconquerable ambition, illimitable faith. They all seem to be
          saying <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0259" n="236"/> their creed. 'I believe in
          myself almighty, and in Venice under my control, and in God who made us both,
          and in the inferiority of the remnant of the habitable globe.' Or else: 'In the
          beginning God created Venice. Then He created the rest of the world. Then He
          created <hi rend="italic">Me</hi>. Then He retired and left me to deal with the
          situation.' Or else: 'I am an earthly Trinity. I am myself. I am Venice. I am
          God.' " </p>
        <p>"It is magnificent!" she cried. "How you understand them! How you understand
          the true aristocratic spirit! They are all, what you call, leaders of men. I did
          not expect an analysis so swift and so true. But, Paul"&mdash;her voice sank
          adorably&mdash;"all these men lack something&mdash;something that you
          have. And that is why I thought you laughed." </p>
        <p>He smiled down on her. "Do you think I was measuring myself with these men?" </p>
        <p>"Naturally. Why should you not?" she asked proudly. </p>
        <p>"And what have I got that they lack?" </p>
        <p>"Happiness," said the Princess. </p>
        <p>Paul was silent for a while, as they moved slowly away to the balcony which
          overlooks the lagoon and San Giorgio Maggiore glowing warm in the sunshine, and
          then he said: "Yet most of those men loved passionately in their time, and were
          loved by beautiful women." </p>
        <p>"Their love was a thing of the passions, not of the spirit. You cannot see a
          woman, that is to say happiness, behind any of their faces." </p>
        <p>He whispered: "Can you see a woman behind mine. </p>
        <p>"If you look like that," she replied, with a contented little laugh, "the whole
          world can see it." And so their talk drifted far away from Doges, just as their
          souls were drifting far from the Golden Calf of the <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0260" n="237"/> Frank and Loyal Friendship which Sophie
          the Princess had set up. </p>
        <p>How could they heip it&mdash;and in Venice of all places in the world? If
          she had determined on maintaining the friendship calm and austere, why in
          Minerva's name had she bidden him hither? Sophie Zobraska passed for a woman of
          sense. None knew better than she the perils of moonlit canals and the sensuous
          splash of water against a gondola, and the sad and dreamy beauty which sets the
          lonely heart aching for love. Why had she done it? Some such questions must
          Mademoiselle de Cressy have asked, for the Princess told him that
          St&#x00E9;phanie had lectured her severely for going about so much in public
          alone with a <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">beau jeune homme.</foreign>
          </hi>
        </p>
        <p>"But we don't always want St&#x00E9;phanie with us," she argued, "and she
          is not sympathetic in Venice. She likes restaurants and people. Besides, she is
          always with her friends at Danielli's, so if it weren't for you I should be
          doing nothing all by myself in the lonely palazzo. <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">Forc&#x00E9;ment</foreign>
          </hi> we go about together." </p>
        <p>Which was all sophistical and nonsensical; and she knew it, for there was a
          mischievous little gleam in her eye as she spoke. But none the less, shutting
          her ears to the unsympathetic St&#x00E9;phanie, did she continue to show
          herself alone in public with the beautiful youth. She had thrown her crown over
          the windmills for a few happy days; for a few happy days she was feeding her
          starved nature, drinking in her fill of beauty and colour and the joy of life.
          And the pair, thus forcibly thrown together, drifted through the narrow canals
          beneath the old crumbling palaces, side by side, and hand in hand while Giacomo
          and Felipe, disregarded automata, bent to their oars. </p>
        <p>One afternoon, one mellow and memorable afternoon, they were returning from
          Murano. Not a breath of wind ruffled the lagoon. The islands in their spring <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0261" n="238"/> verdure slumbered peacefully. Far away
          the shipping in the bacino lay still like enchanted craft. Only a steamer or
          two, and here and there the black line of a gondola with its standing, solitary
          rower, broke the immobility of things. And Venice, russet and rose and grey,
          brooded in the sunset, a city of dreams. They murmured words of wonder and
          regret. Instinctively they drew near and their shoulders touched. Their clasp of
          fingers tightened and their breath came quickly, and for a long time they were
          silent. Then at last he whispered her name, in the old foolish and inevitable
          way. And she turned her face to him, and met his eyes and said "Paul," and her
          lips as she said it seemed to speak a kiss. And all the earth was wrapped in
          glory too overwhelming for speech. </p>
        <p>It was only when they entered the Grand Canal and drew up by the striped posts
          of the palazzo that she said: "I have those Roman people and the Heatherfields
          coming to dinner. I wish I hadn't." She sighed. "Would you care to come?" </p>
        <p>He smiled into her eyes. "No, my Princess, not to-night. I should do silly
          things. To-night I will go and talk to the moon. To-morrow, when can I come?" </p>
        <p>"Early. As early as you like." </p>
        <p>And Paul went away and talked to the moon, and the next morning, his heart
          tumultuous, presented himself at the palazzo. He was shown into the stiff
          Italian drawing-room, with its great Venetian glass chandelier, its heavy
          picture-hung walls, its Empire furniture covered in yellow silk. Presently the
          door opened and she entered, girlish in blouse and skirt, fresh as the morning.
            <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">"Bon jour</foreign>
          </hi>, Paul. I've not had time to put on my hat, but&mdash;" </p>
        <p>She did not end, for he strode toward her and with a little laugh of triumph
          took her in his arms and kissed her. And so what had to be came to pass.</p>

        <p>I LOVE you too much, my Sophie, to be called the Princess Zobraska's husband." </p>
        <p>"And I love you too much, dear, to wish to be called anything else than Paul
          Savelli's wife." </p>
        <p>That was their position, perfectly defined, perfectly understood. They had
          arrived at it after many arguments and kisses and lovers' protestations. </p>
        <p>"Such as I am I am," cried Paul. "A waif and stray, an unknown figure coming
          out of the darkness. I have nothing to give you but my love." </p>
        <p>"Are there titles or riches on earth of equal value?" </p>
        <p>"But I must give you more. The name Paul Savelli itself must be a title of
          honour." </p>
        <p>"It is becoming that," said the Princess. "And we can wait a little, Paul,
          can't we? We are so happy like this. Ah!" she sighed. "I have never been so
          happy in my life." </p>
        <p>"Nor I," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"And am I really the first?" </p>
        <p>"The first. Believe it or not as you like. But it's a fact. I've told you my
          life's dream. I never sank below it; and that is why perhaps it has come true." </p>
        <p>For once the assertion was not the eternal lie. Paul came fresh-hearted to his
          Princess. </p>
        <p>"I wish I were a young girl, Paul." </p>

        <p>They descended to more commonplace themes. Until the great things came, what
          should be their mutual attitude before Society? </p>
        <p>"Until I can claim you, let it be our dear and beautiful secret," said Paul. "I
          would not have it vulgarized by the chattering world for anything in life." </p>
        <p>Then Paul proved himself to be a proud and delicate lover, and when London with
          its season and its duties and its pleasures absorbed them, he had his reward.
          For it was sweet to see her in great assemblies, shining like a queen and like a
          queen surrounded by homage, and to know that he alone of mortals was enthroned
          in her heart. It was sweet to meet her laughing glance, dear fellow-conspirator.
          It was sweet every morning and night to have the intimate little talk through
          the telephone. And it was sweetest of all to snatch a precious hour with her
          alone. Of such vain and foolish things is made all that is most beautiful in
          life. </p>
        <p>He took his dearest lady&mdash;though Miss Winwood, now disclaimed the
          title&mdash;into his confidence. So did the Princess. It was very comforting
          to range Miss Winwood on their side; and to feel themselves in close touch with
          her wisdom and sympathy. And her sympathy manifested itself in practical
          ways&mdash;those of the woman confidante of every love affair since the
          world began. Why should the Princess Zobraska not interest herself in some of
          the philanthropic schemes of which the house in Portland Place was the
          headquarters? There was one, a Forlorn Widows' Fund, the presidency of which she
          would be willing to resign in favour of the Princess. The work was trivial: it
          consisted chiefly in consultation with Mr. Savelli and in signing letters. The
          Princess threw her arms round her neck, laughing and blushing and calling her
            <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">d&#x00E9;licieuse</foreign>
          </hi>. You see it was obvious that Mr. Savelli <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0264"
            n="241"/> could not be consulted in his official capacity or official letters
          signed elsewhere than in official precincts. </p>
        <p>"I'll do what I can for the pair of you," said Miss Winwood to Paul. "But it's
          the most delightfully mad and impossible thing I've ever put my hand to." </p>
        <p>Accepting the fact of their romance, however, she could not but approve Paul's
          attitude. It was the proud attitude of the boy who nearly six years ago was
          going, without a word, penniless and debonair out of her house. All the woman in
          her glowed over him. </p>
        <p>"I'm not going to be called an adventurer," he had declared. "I shall not
          submit Sophie to the indignity of trailing a despised husband after her. I'm not
          going to use her rank and wealth as a stepping-stone to my ambitions. Let me
          first attain an unassailable position. I shall have owed it to you, to myself,
          to anybody you like&mdash;but not to my marriage. I shall be somebody. The
          rest won't matter. The marriage will then be a romantic affair, and romantic
          affairs are not unpopular <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">dans le monde o&#x00F9; l'on s'ennuie</foreign>
          </hi>." </p>
        <p>This declaration was all very well; the former part all very noble, the latter
          exhibiting a knowledge of the world rather shrewd for one so young. But when
          would he be able to attain his unassailable position? Some years hence. Would
          Sophie Zobraska, who was only a few months younger than he, be content to
          sacrifice these splendid and irretrievable years of her youth? Ursula Winwood
          looked into the immediate future, and did not see it rosy. The first step toward
          an unassailable position was flight from the nest. This presupposed an income.
          If the party had been in power it would not have been difficult to find him a
          post. She worried herself exceedingly, for in her sweet and unreprehensible way
          she was more than <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0265" n="242"/> ever in love with
          Paul. Meeting Frank Ayres one night at a large reception, she sought his advice. </p>
        <p>"Do you mind a wrench?" he asked. "No? Well, then&mdash;you and Colonel
          Winwood send him about his business and get another secretary. Let Savelli give
          all his time to his Young England League. Making him mug up material for
          Winwood's speeches and write letters to constituents about football clubs is
          using a razor to cut butter. His League's the thing. It can surely afford to pay
          him a decent salary. If it can't I'll see to a guarantee." </p>
        <p>"The last thing we see, my dear Frank," she said after she had thanked him, "is
          that which is right under our noses." </p>
        <p>The next day she went to Paul full of the scheme. Had he ever thought of it? He
          took her hands and smiled in his gay, irresistible way. "Of course, dearest
          lady," he said frankly. "But I would have cut out my tongue sooner than suggest
          it." </p>
        <p>"I know that, my dear boy." </p>
        <p>"And yet," said he, "I can't bear the idea of tearing myself away from you. It
          seems like black ingratitude." </p>
        <p>"It isn't. You forget that James and I have our little ambitions
          too&mdash;the ambition of a master for a favourite pupil. If you were a
          failure we should both be bitterly disappointed. Don't you see? And as for
          leaving us&mdash;why need you? We should miss you horribly. You've never
          been quite our paid servant. And now you're something like our son." Tears
          started in the sweet lady's clear eyes. "Even if you did go to your own
          chambers, I shouldn't let our new secretary have this room"&mdash;they were
          in what the household called "the office"&mdash;really Paul's luxuriously
          furnished private sitting room, which contained his own little treasures of
          books and pictures and bits of china and <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0266"
            n="243"/> glass accumulated during the six years of easeful life&mdash;"He
          will have the print room, which nobody uses from one year's end to another, and
          which is far more convenient for the street door. And the same at Drane's Court.
          So when you no longer work for us, my dear boy, our home will be yours, as long
          as you're content to stay, just because we love you." </p>
        <p>Her hand was on his shoulder and his head was bent. "God grant," said he, "that
          I may be worthy of your love." </p>
        <p>He looked up and met her eyes. Her hand was still on his shoulder. Then very
          simply he bent down and kissed her on the cheek. </p>
        <p>He told his Princess all about it. She listened with dewy eyes. "Ah, Paul," she
          said. "That 'precious seeing' of love&mdash;I never had it till you came. I
          was blind. I never knew that there were such beautiful souls as Ursula Winwood
          in the world." </p>
        <p>"Dear, how I love you for saying that!" cried Paul. </p>
        <p>"But it's true." </p>
        <p>"That is why," said he. </p>
        <p>So the happiest young man in London worked and danced through the season,
          knowing that the day of emancipation was at hand. His transference from the
          Winwoods to the League was fixed for October i. He made great plans for an
          extension of the League's, activities, dreamed of a palace for headquarters with
          the banner of St. George flying proudly over it, an object-lesson for the
          nation. One day in July while. he was waiting for Colonel Winwood in the lobby
          of the House of Commons, Frank Ayres stopped in the middle of a busy rush and
          shook hands. </p>
        <p>"Been down to Hickney Heath again? I would if I were you. Rouse 'em up." </p>
        <p>As the words of a Chief Whip are apt to be significant, <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0267" n="244"/> Paul closeted himself with the
          President of the Hickney Heath Lodge, who called the Secretary of the local
          Conservative Association to the interview. The result was that Paul was invited
          to speak at an anti-Budget meeting convened by the Association. He spoke, and
          repeated his success. The Conservative newspapers the next morning gave a <hi
            rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9;</foreign>
          </hi> of his speech. His Sophie, coming to sign letters in her presidential
          capacity, brought him the cuttings, a proceeding which he thought adorable. The
          season ended triumphantly. </p>
        <p>For a while he lost his Princess. She went to Cowes, then to stay with French
          relations in a chateau in the Dordogne. Paul went off yachting with the Chudleys
          and returned for the shooting to Drane's Court. In the middle of September the
          Winwoods' new secretary arrived and received instruction in his duties. Then
          came the Princess to Morebury Park. "Dearest," she said, in his arms, "I never
          want to leave you again. France is no longer France for me since I have England
          in my heart." </p>
        <p>"You remember that? My wonderful Princess!" </p>
        <p>He found her more woman, more expansive, more bewitchingly caressing. Absence
          had but brought her nearer. When she laid her head on his shoulder and murmured
          in the deep and subtle tones of her own language: "My Paul, it seems such a
          waste of time to be apart," it took all his pride and will to withstand the
          maddening temptation. He vowed that the time would soon come when he could claim
          her, and went away in feverish search for worlds to conquer. </p>
        <p>Then came October and London once more. </p>
        <p>* * * * * * Paul was dressing for dinner one evening when a reply-paid telegram
          was brought to him. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0268" n="245"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="italic">"If selected by local committee will you stand for Hickney
            Heath? Ayres."</hi>

        </p>
        <p>He sat on his bed, white and trembling, and stared at the simple question. The
          man-servant stood imperturbable, silver tray in hand. Seeing the reply-paid
          form, he waited for a few moments. </p>
        <p>"Is there an answer, sir?" </p>
        <p>Paul nodded, asked for a pencil, and with a shaky hand wrote the reply. "Yes,"
          was all he said. </p>
        <p>Then with reaction came the thrill of mighty exultation, and, throwing on his
          clothes, he rushed to the telephone in his sitting room. Who first to hear the
          wondrous news but his Princess? That there was a vacancy in Hickney Heath he
          knew, as all Great Britain knew; for Ponting, the Radical Member, had died
          suddenly the day before. But it had never entered his head that he could be
          chosen as a candidate. </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">"Mais j'y ai bien pens&#x00E9;, moi,"</foreign>
          </hi> came the voice through the telephone. "Why did Lord Francis tell you to go
          to Hickney Heath last July?" </p>
        <p>How a woman leaps at things I With all his ambition, his astuteness, his
          political intuition, he had not seen the opportunity. But it had come. Verily
          the stars in their courses were fighting for him. Other names, he was aware,
          were before the Committee of the Local Association, perhaps a great name
          suggested by the Central Unionist Organization; there was also that of the
          former Tory member, who, smarting under defeat at the General Election, had
          taken but a lukewarm interest in the constituency and was now wandering in the
          Far East. But Paul, confident in his destiny, did not doubt that he would be
          selected. And then, within the next fortnight&mdash;for bye-elections during
          a Parliamentary session are matters of sweeping swiftness&mdash;would come
          the great battle, the great <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0269" n="246"/> decisive
          battle of his life, and he would win. He must win. His kingdom was at
          stake&mdash;the dream kingdom of his life into which he would enter with his
          loved and won Princess on his arm. He poured splendid foolishness through the
          telephone into an enraptured ear. </p>
        <p>The lack of a sense of proportion is a charge often brought against women; but
          how often do men (as they should) thank God for it? Here was Sophie Zobraska,
          reared from childhood in the atmosphere of great affairs, mixing daily with folk
          who guided the destiny of nations, having two years before refused in marriage
          one of those who held the peace of Europe in his hands, moved to tense
          excitement of heart and brain and soul by the news that an obscure young man
          might possibly be chosen to contest a London Borough for election to the British
          Parliament, and thrillingly convinced that now Was imminent the great momentous
          crisis in the history of mankind. </p>
        <p>With a lack of the same sense of proportion, equal in kind, though perhaps not
          so passionate in degree, did Miss Winwood receive the world-shaking tidings. She
          wept, and, thinking Paul a ph&oelig;nix, called Frank Ayres an angel.
          Colonel Winwood tugged his long, drooping moustache and said very little; but he
          committed the astounding indiscretion of allowing his glass to be filled with
          champagne; whereupon he lifted it, and said, "Here's luck, my dear boy," and
          somewhat recklessly gulped down the gout-compelling liquid. And after dinner,
          when Miss Winwood had left them together, he lighted a long Corona instead of
          his usual stumpy Bock, and discussed with Paul electioneering ways and means. </p>
        <p>For the next day or two Paul lived in a whirl of telephones, telegrams,
          letters, scurryings across London, interviews, brain-racking questionings and
          reiterated <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0270" n="247"/> declarations of political
          creed. But his selection was a foregone conclusion. His youth, his absurd
          beauty, his fire and eloquence, his unswerving definiteness of aim, his magic
          that had inspired so many with a belief in him and had made him the Fortunate
          Youth, captivated the imagination of the essentially unimaginative. Before a
          committee of wits and poets, Paul perhaps would not have had a dog's chance. But
          he appealed to the hard-headed merchants and professional men who chose him very
          much as the hero of melodrama appeals to a pit and gallery audience. He
          symbolized to them hope and force and predestined triumph. One or two at first
          sniffed suspiciously at his lofty ideals; but as there was no mistaking his
          political soundness, they let the ideals pass, as a natural and evanescent
          aroma. </p>
        <p>So, in his thirtieth year, Paul was nominated as Unionist candidate for the
          Borough of Hickney Heath, and he saw himself on the actual threshold of the
          great things to which he was born. He wrote a little note to Jane telling her
          the news. He also wrote to Barney Bill: "You dear old Tory&mdash;did you
          ever dream that ragamuffin little Paul was going to represent you in Parliament?
          Get out the dear old 'bus and paint it blue, with 'Paul Savelli forever' in gold
          letters, and, instead of chairs and mats, hang it with literature, telling what
          a wonderful fellow P. S. is. And go through the streets of Hickney Heath with
          it, and say if you like: 'I knew him when' he was a nipper&mdash;that high.'
          And if you like to be mysterious and romantic you can say: 'I, Barney Bill, gave
          him his first chance,' as you did, my dear old friend, and Paul's not the man to
          forget it. Oh, Barney, it's too wonderful"&mdash;his heart went out to the
          old man. "If I get in I will tell you something that will knock you flat. It
          will be the realization of all the silly rubbish <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0271" n="248"/> I talked in the old brickfield at
          Bludston. But, dear old friend, it was you and the open road that first set me
          on the patriotic lay, and there's not a voter in Hickney Heath who can vote as
          you can&mdash;for his own private and particular trained candidate." </p>
        <p>Jane, for reasons unconjectured, did not reply. But from Barney Bill, who, it
          must be remembered, had leanings toward literature, he received a postcard with
          the following inscription: "Paul, Hif I can help you konker the Beastes of
          Effesus I will. Bill." </p>
        <p>And then began the furious existence of an electioneering campaign. His side
          had a clear start of the Radicals, who found some hitch in the choice of their
          candidate. The Young England League leaped into practical enthusiasm over their
          champion. Seldom has young candidate had so glad a welcome. And behind him stood
          his Sophie, an inspiring goddess. </p>
        <p>It so happened that for a date a few days hence had been fixed the Annual
          General Meeting of the Forlorn Widows' Fund, when Report and Balance Sheet were
          presented to the society. The control of this organization Paul had not allowed
          to pass into the alien hands of Townsend, the Winwoods' new secretary. Had not
          his Princess, for the most delicious reasons in the world, been made President?
          He scorned Ursula Winwood's suggestion that for this year he would allow
          Townsend to manage affairs. "What!" cried he, "leave my Princess in the lurch on
          her first appearance? Never!" By telephone he arranged an hour for the next day,
          when they could all consult together over this important matter. </p>
        <p>"But, my dear boy," said Miss Winwood, "your time is not your own. Suppose
          you're detained at Hickney Heath?" </p>
        <p>"The Conqueror," he cried, with a gay laugh, "belongs to the
          Detainers&mdash;not the Detained." <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0272" n="249"
          />
        </p>
        <p>She looked at him out of her clear eyes, and shook an indulgent head. . </p>
        <p>"I know," said he, meeting her glance shrewdly. "He has got to use his
          detaining faculty with discretion. I've made a study of the little ways of
          conquerors. Ali! Dearest lady!" he burst out suddenly, in his impetuous way,
          "I'm talking nonsense; but I'm so uncannily happy!" </p>
        <p>"It does me good to look at you," she said.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XVII</head>

        <p>PAUL leaned back in his leather writing chair, smoking a cigarette and
          focussing the electioneering situation. Beside a sheet of foolscap on which he
          had been jotting down notes lay in neat piles the typewritten Report of the
          Forlorn Widows' Fund, the account book and the banker's pass book. He had sat up
          till three o'clock in the morning preparing for his Princess. Nothing now
          remained but the formal "examined and found correct" report of the auditors. For
          the moment the Forlorn Widows stood leagues away from Paul's thoughts. He had
          passed a strenuous day at Hickney Heath, lunching in the committee room on
          sandwiches and whisky and soda obtained from the nearest tavern, talking,
          inventing, dictating, writing, playing upon dull minds the flashes of his
          organizing genius. His committee was held up for the while by a dark rift in the
          Radical camp. They had not yet chosen their man. Nothing was known, save that a
          certain John Questerhayes, K. C., an eminent Chancery barrister, who had of late
          made himself conspicuous in the constituency, had been turned down on the ground
          that he was not sufficiently progressive. Now for comfort to the Radical the
          term "Progressive" licks the blessed word Mesopotamia into a cocked hat. Under
          the Progressive's sad-coloured cloak he need not wear the red tie of the
          socialist. Apparently Mr. Questerhayes objected to the sad-coloured cloak, the
          mantle of Elijah, M. P., the late member for Hickney Heath. "Wanted: an Elisha,"
          seemed to be the cry of the Radical Committee. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0274"
            n="251"/>
        </p>
        <p>Paul leaned back, his elbows on the arms of his chair, his finger tips
          together, a cigarette between his lips, lost in thought. The early November
          twilight deepened in the room. He was to address a meeting that night. In order
          to get ready for his speech he had not allowed himself to be detained, and had
          come home early. His speech had been prepared; but the Radical delay was a new
          factor of which he might take triumphant advantage. Hence the pencil notes on
          the sheet of foolscap, before him. </p>
        <p>A man-servant came in, turned on the electric light, pulled the curtains
          together and saw to the fire. </p>
        <p>"Tea's in the drawing-room, sir." </p>
        <p>"Bring me some here in a breakfast cup&mdash;nothing to eat," said Paul. </p>
        <p>Even his dearest lady could not help him in his meditated attack on the enemy
          whom the Lord was delivering into his hands. </p>
        <p>The man-servant went away. Presently Paul heard him re&#x00EB;nter the
          room; the door was at his back. He threw out an impatient hand behind him. "Put
          it down anywhere, Wilton, I'll have it when I want it." </p>
        <p>"I beg pardon, sir," said the man, coming forward, "but it's not the tea.
          There's a gentleman and a lady and another person would like to see you. I said
          that you were busy, sir, but&mdash;" </p>
        <p>He put the silver salver, with its card, in front of Paul. Printed on the card
          was, "Mr. Silas Finn." In pencil was written: "Miss Seddon, Mr. William
          Simmons." </p>
        <p>Paul looked at the card in some bewilderment. What in the name of politics or
          friendship were they doing in Portland Place? Not to receive them, however, was
          unthinkable. </p>
        <p>"Show them in," said he. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0275" n="252"/>
        </p>
        <p>Silas Finn, Jane and Barney Bill! It was odd. He laughed and took out his
          watch. Yes, he could easily give them half an hour or so. But why had they come?
          He had found time to call once at the house in Hickney Heath since his return to
          town, and then he had seen Jane and Silas Finn together and they had talked, as
          far as he could remember, of the Disestablishment of the Anglican Church and the
          elevating influence of landscape painting on the human soul. Why had they come?
          It could not be to offer their services during the election, for Silas Finn in
          politics was a fanatical enemy. The visit stirred a lively curiosity. </p>
        <p>They entered: Mr. Finn in his usual black with many-coloured tie and diamond
          ring, looking more mournfully grave than ever; Jane wearing an expression half
          of anxiety and half of defiance; Barney Bill, very uncomfortable in his
          well-preserved best suit, very restless and nervous. They gave the impression of
          a deputation coming to announce the death of a near relative. Paul received them
          cordially. But why in the world, thought he, were they all so solemn? He pushed
          forward chairs. </p>
        <p>"I got your postcard, Bill. Thanks so much for it." </p>
        <p>Bill grunted and embraced his hard felt hat. </p>
        <p>"I ought to have written to you," said Jane&mdash;"but&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"She felt restrained by her duty towards me," said Mr. Finn. "I hope you did
          not think it was discourteous on her part." </p>
        <p>"My dear sir," Paul laughed, seating himself in his writing chair, which he
          twisted away from the table, "Jane and I are too old friends for that. In her
          heart I know she wishes me luck. And I hope you do too, Mr. Finn," he added
          pleasantly&mdash;"although I know you're on the other side." <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0276" n="253"/>
        </p>
        <p>"I'm afraid my principles will not allow me to wish you luck in this election,
          Mr. Savelli." </p>
        <p>"Well, well," said Paul. "It doesn't matter. If you vote against me I'll not
          bear malice." </p>
        <p>"I am not going to vote against you, Mr. Savelli," said Mr. Finn, looking at
          him with melancholy eyes. "I am going to stand against you." </p>
        <p>Paul sprang forward in his chair. Here was fantastic news indeed! "Stand
          against me? You? You're the Radical candidate?" </p>
        <p>"Yes." </p>
        <p>Paul laughed boyishly. "Why, it's capital! I'm awfully glad." </p>
        <p>"I was asked this morning," said Mr. Finn gravely. "I prayed God for guidance.
          He answered, and I felt it my duty to come to you at once, with our two
          friends." </p>
        <p>Barney Bill cocked his head on one side. "I did my best to persuade him not to,
          sonny." </p>
        <p>"But why shouldn't he?" cried Paul courteously&mdash;though why he should
          puzzled him exceedingly. "It's very good of you, Mr. Finn. I'm sure your side,"
          he went on, "could not have chosen a better man. You're well known in the
          constituency&mdash;I am jolly lucky to have a man like you as an opponent." </p>
        <p>"Mr. Savelli," said Mr. Finn, "it was precisely so that we should not be
          opponents that I have taken this unusual step." </p>
        <p>"I don't quite understand," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Mr. Finn wants you to retire in favour of some other Conservative candidate,"
          said Jane calmly. </p>
        <p>"Retire? I retire?" </p>
        <p>Paul looked at her, then at Barney Bill, who nodded his white head, then at Mr.
          Finn, whose deep eyes met his with a curious tragical mournfulness. The proposal
          took his breath away. It was crazily preposterous. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0277" n="254"/> But for their long faces he would have
          burst into laughter. "Why on earth do you want me to retire?" he asked
          good-humouredly. </p>
        <p>"I will tell you," said Mr. Finn. "Because you will have God against you." </p>
        <p>Paul saw a gleam of light in the dark mystery of the visit. "You may believe
          it, Mr. Finn, but I don't. I believe that my war cry, 'God for England, Savelli
          and Saint George,' is quite as acceptable to, the Almighty as yours." </p>
        <p>Mr. Finn stretched out two hands in earnest deprecation. "Forgive me if I say
          it; but you don't know what you're talking about. God has not revealed Himself
          to you. He has to me. When my fellow-citizens asked me to stand as the Liberal
          candidate, I thought it was because they knew me to be an upright man, who had
          worked hard on their council, an active apostle in the cause of religion,
          temperance and the suppression of vice. I thought I had merely deserved well in
          their opinion. When I fell on my knees and prayed the glory of the Lord spread
          about me and I knew that they had been divinely inspired. It was revealed to me
          that this was a Divine Call to represent the Truth in the Parliament of the
          nation." </p>
        <p>"I remember your saying, when I first had the pleasure of meeting you," Paul
          remarked, with unwonted dryness, "that the Kingdom of Heaven was not adequately
          represented in the House of Commons." </p>
        <p>"I have not changed my opinion, Mr Savelli. The hand of God has guided my
          business. The hand of God is placing me in the House of Commons to work His
          will. You cannot oppose God's purpose, Paul Savelli&mdash;and that is why I
          beg you not to stand against me." </p>
        <p>"You see, he likes yer," interjected Barney Bill, with anxiety in his
          glittering eyes. "That's why he's <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0278" n="255"/>
          a-doing of it. He says to hisself, says he, 'ere's a young chap what I likes
          with his first great chance in front of him, with the eyes of the country sot on
          him&mdash;now if I comes in and smashes him, as I can't help myself from
          doing, it'll be all u-p with that young chap's glorious career. But if I warns
          him in time, then he can retire&mdash;find an honourable
          retreat&mdash;that's what he wants yer to have&mdash;an honourable
          retreat. Isn't that it, Silas?" </p>
        <p>"Those are the feelings by which I am actuated," said Mr. Finn. </p>
        <p>Paul stretched himself out in his chair, his ankles crossed, and surveyed his
          guests. "What do you think of it, Jane?" said he, not without a touch of irony. </p>
        <p>She had been looking into the fire, her face in profile. Addressed, she turned.
          "Mr. Finn has your interests very deep at heart," she answered tonelessly. </p>
        <p>Paul jumped to his feet and laughed his fresh laugh. It was all so comic, so
          incredible, so mad. Yet none of them appeared to see any humour in the
          situation. There sat Jane and Barney Bill cowering under the influence of their
          crazy fishmongering apostle; and there, regarding him with a world of appeal in
          his sorrowful eyes, sat the apostle himself, bolt upright in his chair, an odd
          figure with his streaked black and white hair, ascetic face and
          Methodistico-Tattersall raiment. And they all seemed to expect him to obey this
          quaint person's fanatical whimsy. </p>
        <p>"It's very kind indeed of you, Mr. Finn, to consult my interests in this
          manner," said he. "And I'm most indebted to you for your consideration. But, as
          I said before, I've as much reason for believing God to be on my side as you
          have. And I honestly believe I'm going to win this election. So I certainly
          won't withdraw." </p>
        <p>"I implore you to do so. I will go on my knees and <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0279" n="256"/> beseech you," said Mr. Finn, with hands
          clasped in front of him. </p>
        <p>Paul looked round. "I'm afraid, Bill," said he, "that this is getting rather
          painful." </p>
        <p>"It is painful. It's more than painful. It's horrible! It's ghastly!" cried Mr.
          Finn, in sudden shrill crescendo, leaping to his feet. In an instant the man's
          demeanour had changed. The mournful apostle had become a wild, vibrating
          creature with flashing eyes and fingers. </p>
        <p>"Easy, now, Silas. Whoa! Steady!" said Barney Bill. </p>
        <p>Silas Finn advanced on Paul and clapped his hands on his shoulders and shouted
          hoarsely: "For the love of God&mdash;don't thwart me in this. You can't
          thwart me. You daren't thwart me. You daren't thwart God." </p>
        <p>Paul disengaged himself impatiently. The humour had passed from the situation.
          The man was a lunatic, a religious maniac. Again he addressed Barney Bill. "As I
          can't convince Mr. Finn of the absurdity 0 f his request, I must ask you to do
          so for me." </p>
        <p>"Young man," cried Silas, quivering with passion, "do not speak to God's
          appointed in your vanity and your arrogance. You&mdash;you&mdash;of all
          human beings&mdash;" </p>
        <p>Both Jane and Barney Bill closed round him. Jane clutched his arm. "Come away.
          Do come away." </p>
        <p>"Steady now, Silas," implored Barney Bill. "You see it's no use. I told you so.
          Come along." </p>
        <p>"Leave me alone," shouted Finn, casting them off. "What have I to do with you?
          It is that young man there who defies God and me." </p>
        <p>"Mr. Finn," said Paul, very erect, "if I have hurt your feelings I am sorry.
          But I fight this election. That's final. The choice no longer rests with me. I'm
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0280" n="257"/> the instrument of my party. I
          desire to be courteous in every way, but you must see that it would be useless
          to prolong this discussion." And he moved to the door. </p>
        <p>"Come away now, for Heaven's sake. Can't you realize it's no good?" said Jane,
          white to the lips. </p>
        <p>Silas Finn again cast her off and railed and raved at her. "I will not go
          away," he cried in wild passion. "I will not allow my own son to raise an
          impious hand against the Almighty." </p>
        <p>"Lor' lumme! " gasped Barney Bill, dropping his hat. "He's done it." </p>
        <p>There was a silence. Silas Finn stood shaking in the middle of the room, the
          sweat streaming down his forehead. </p>
        <p>Paul turned at the door and walked slowly up to him. "Your son? What do you
          mean?" </p>
        <p>Jane, with wringing hands and tense, uplifted face, said in a queer cracked
          voice: "He promised us not to speak. He has broken his promise." </p>
        <p>"You broke your sacred word," said Barney Bill. </p>
        <p>The man's face grew haggard. His passion left him as suddenly as it had seized
          him. He collapsed, a piteous wreck, looked wide of the three, and threw out his
          hands helplessly. "I broke my promise. May God forgive me!" </p>
        <p>"That's neither here nor there," said Paul, standing over him. "You must answer
          my question. What do you mean?" </p>
        <p>Barney Bill limped a step or two toward him and cleared his throat. "He's quite
          correct, sonny. Silas Kegworthy's your father right enough." </p>
        <p>"Kegworthy?" </p>
        <p>"Yes. Changed his name for business&mdash;and other reasons." </p>
        <p>"He?" said Paul, half dazed for the moment and <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0281"
            n="258"/> pointing at Silas Finn. "His name is Kegworthy and he is my father?" </p>
        <p>"Yes, sonny. 'Tain't my fault, or Jane's. He took his Bible oath he wouldn't
          tell yer. We was afraid, so we come with him." </p>
        <p>"Then?" queried Paul, jerking a thumb toward Lancashire. </p>
        <p>"Polly Kegworthy? Yes. She was yer mother." </p>
        <p>Paul set his teeth and drew a deep breath&mdash;not of air, but of a
          million sword points, Jane watched him out of frightened eyes. She alone, with
          her all but life-long knowledge of him, and with her woman's intuition, realized
          the death-blow that he had received. And when she saw him take it unflinching
          and stand proud and stern, her heart leaped toward him, though she knew that the
          woman in the great chased silver photograph frame on the mantelpiece, the great
          and radiant lady, the high and mighty and beautiful and unapproachable Princess,
          was the woman he loved. Paul touched his father on the wrist, and motioned to a
          chair. </p>
        <p>"Please sit down. You too, please,"&mdash;he waved a hand, and himself
          resumed his seat in his writing chair. He turned it so that he could rest his
          elbow on his table and his forehead in his palm. "You claim to be my father,"
          said he. "Barney Bill, in whom I have implicit confidence, confirms it. He says
          that Mrs. Button is my mother&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"She has been dead these six years," said Barney Bill. </p>
        <p>"Why didn't you tell me?" asked Paul. </p>
        <p>"I didn't think it would interest yer, sonny," replied Barney Bill, in great
          distress. "Yer see, we conspirated together for yer never to know nothing at all
          about all this. Anyway, she's dead and won't worry yer any more." </p>
        <p>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0282" n="259"/> "She was a bad mother to me. She is a
          memory of terror. I don't pretend to be grieved," said Paul; "any more than I
          pretend to be overcome by filial emotion at the present moment. But, if you are
          my father, I should be glad to know&mdash;in fact, I think I'm entitled to
          know&mdash;why you've taken thirty years to reveal yourself, and
          why"&mdash;a sudden fury swept him&mdash;"why you've come now to play
          hell with my life." </p>
        <p>"It is the will of God," said Silas Finn, in deep dejection. </p>
        <p>Paul snapped three or four fingers. "Bah!" he cried. "Talk sense. Talk facts.
          Leave God out of the question for a while. It's blasphemy to connect Him with a
          sordid business like this. Tell me about myself&mdash;my
          parentage&mdash;let me know where I am." </p>
        <p>"You're with three people as loves yer, sonny," said Barney Bill. "What passes
          in this room will never be known to another soul on earth." </p>
        <p>"That I swear," said Silas Finn. </p>
        <p>"You can publish it broadcast in every newspaper in England," said Paul. "I'm
          making no bargains. Good God! I'm asking for nothing but the truth. What use I
          make of it is my affair. You can do&mdash;the three of you&mdash;what
          you like. Let the world know. It doesn't matter. It's I that matter&mdash;my
          life and my conscience and my soul that matter." </p>
        <p>"Don't be too hard upon me," Silas besought him very humbly. </p>
        <p>"Tell me about myself," said Paul. </p>
        <p>Silas Finn wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and covered his eyes with
          his hand. "That can only mean telling you about <hi rend="italic">my</hi>self,"
          he said. "It's raking up a past which I had hoped, with God's help, to bury. But
          I have sinned to-night, and it is my punishment to tell you. And you have a
          right to know. My <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0283" n="260"/> father was a porter
          in Covent Garden Market. My mother&mdash;I've already mentioned&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"Yes&mdash;the Sicilian and the barrel organ&mdash;I remember," said
          Paul, with a shiver. </p>
        <p>"I had a hard boyhood. But I rose a little above my class. I educated myself
          more or less. At last I became assistant in a fishmonger's shop. Our friend
          Simmons here and I were boys together. We fell in love with the same girl. I
          married her. Not long afterward she gave way to drink. I found that in all kinds
          of ways I had mistaken her character. I can't describe your own mother to you.
          She had a violent temper. So had I. My life was a hell upon earth. One day she
          goaded me beyond my endurance and I struck at her with a knife. I meant at the
          bloodred instant to kill her. But I didn't. I nearly killed her. I went to
          prison for three years. When I came out she had vanished, taking you with her.
          In prison I found the Grace of God and I vowed it should be my guide through
          life. As soon as I was free from police supervision I changed my
          name&mdash;I believe it's a good old Devonshire name; my father came from
          there&mdash;the prison taint hung about it. Then, when I found I could
          extend a miserable little business I had got together, I changed it again to
          suit my trade. That's about all." </p>
        <p>There was a spell of dead silence. The shrunken man, stricken with a sense of
          his sin of oath-breaking, had Spoken without change of attitude, his hand over
          his eyes. Paul, too, sat motionless, and neither Jane nor Barney Bill spoke.
          Presently Silas Finn continued: </p>
        <p>"For many years I tried to find my wife and son&mdash;but it was not God's
          will. I have lived with the stain of murder on my soul"&mdash;his voice
          sank&mdash;"and it has never been washed away. Perhaps it will be in God's
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0284" n="261"/> good time. . . . And I had
          condemned my son to a horrible existence&mdash;for I knew my wife was not
          capable of bringing you up in the way of clean living. I was right. Simmons has
          since told me--and I was crushed beneath the burden of my sins." </p>
        <p>After a pause he raised a drawn face and went on to tell of his meeting, the
          year before, with Barney Bill, of whom he had lost track when the prison doors
          had closed behind him. It had been in one of his Fish Palaces where Bill was
          eating. They recognized each other. Barney Bill told his tale: how he had run
          across Polly Kegworthy after a dozen years' wandering; how, for love of his old
          friend, he had taken Paul, child of astonishing promise, away from
          Bludston&mdash; </p>
        <p>"Do you remember, sonny, when I left you alone that night and went to the other
          side of the brickfield? It was to think it out," said Bill. "To think out my
          duty as a man." </p>
        <p>Paul nodded. He was listening, with death in his heart. The whole fantastic
          substructure of his life had been suddenly kicked away, and his life was an
          inchoate ruin. Gone was the glamour of romance in which since the day of the
          cornelian heart he had had his essential being. Up to an hour ago he had never
          doubted his mysterious birth. No real mother could have pursued an innocent
          child with Polly Kegworthy's implacable hatred. His passionate repudiation of
          her had been a cardinal article of his faith. On the other hand, the prince and
          princess theory he had long ago consigned to the limbo of childish things; but
          the romance of his birth, the romance of his high destiny, remained a vital part
          of his spiritual equipment. His looks, his talents, his temperament, his
          instincts, his dreams had been irrefutable confirmations. His mere honesty, his
          mere integrity, had been based on this <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0285" n="262"
          /> fervent and unshakable creed. And now it had gone. No more romance. No more
          glamour. No more Vision Splendid now faded into the light of common and sordid
          day. Outwardly listening, his gay, mobile face turned to iron, he lived in a
          molten intensity of thought, his acute brain swiftly coordinating the ironical
          scraps of history. He was the son of Polly Kegworthy. So far he was unclean; but
          hitherto her blood had not manifested itself in him. He was the son of this
          violent and pathetic fanatic, this ex-convict; he had his eyes, his refined
          face; perhaps he inherited from him the artistic temperament&mdash;he
          recalled grimly the daubs on the man's walls, and his purblind gropings toward
          artistic self-expression; and all this&mdash;the Southern handsomeness, and
          Southern love of colour, had come from his Sicilian grandmother, the nameless
          drab, with bright yellow handkerchief over swarthy brows, turning the handle of
          a barrel organ in the London streets. Instinct had been right in its promptings
          to assume an Italian name; but the irony of it was of the quality that makes for
          humour in hell. And his very Christian name&mdash;Paul&mdash;the exotic
          name which Polly Kegworthy would not have given to a brat of hers&mdash;was
          but a natural one for a Silas to give his son, a Silas born of generations of
          evangelical peasants. His eyes rested on the photograph of his Princess. She,
          first of all, was gone with the Vision. An adventurer he had possibly been; but
          an adventurer of romance, carried high by his splendid faith, and regarding his
          marriage with the Princess but as a crowning of his romantic destiny. But now he
          beheld himself only as a base-born impostor. His Princess was gone from his
          life. Death was in his heart. </p>
        <p>He saw his familiar, luxurious room as in a dream, and Jane, anxious-eyed,
          looking into the fire, and Barney Bill a little way off, clutching his hard felt
          hat <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0286" n="263"/> against his body; but his eyes
          were fixed on the strange, many-passioned, unbalanced man who claimed to
          be&mdash;nay, who was&mdash;his father. </p>
        <p>"When I first met you that night my heart went out to you," he was saying. "It
          overflowed in thankfulness to God that He had delivered you out of the power of
          the Dog, and in His inscrutable mercy had condoned that part of my sin as a
          father and had set you in high places." </p>
        <p>With the fringe of his brain Paul recognized, for the first time, how he
          brought into ordinary talk the habits of speech acquired in addressing a Free
          Zionist congregation. </p>
        <p>"It was only the self-restraint," Silas continued, "taught me by bitter years
          of agony and a message from God that it was part of my punishment not to
          acknowledge you as my son&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"And what I told you, and what Jane told you about him," said Barney Bill.
          "Remember that, Silas." </p>
        <p>"I remember it&mdash;it was these influences that kept me silent. But we
          were drawn together, Paul." He bent forward in his chair. "You liked me. In
          spite of all our differences of caste and creed&mdash;you liked me." </p>
        <p>"Yes, I was drawn to you," said Paul, and a strange, unknown note in his voice
          caused Jane to glance at him swiftly. "You seemed to be a man of many sorrows
          and deep enthusiasms&mdash;and I admit I was in close sympathy with you." He
          paused, not moving from his rigid attitude, and then went on: "What you have
          told me of your sufferings&mdash;and I know, with awful knowledge, the woman
          who was my mother&mdash;has made me sympathize with you all the more. But to
          express that sympathy in any way you must give me time. I said you had played
          hell with my life. It's true. One of these days I may be able to explain. Not
          now. There's no time. We're caught up in the <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0287"
            n="264"/> wheels of an inexorable political machine. I address my party in the
          constituency to-night." It was a cold intelligence that spoke, and once more
          Jane flashed a half-frightened glance at him. "What I shall say to them, in view
          of all this, I don't quite know. I must have half an hour to think." </p>
        <p>"I know I oughtn't to interfere, Paul," said Jane, "but you mustn't blame Mr.
          Finn too much. Although he differs from you in politics and so on, he loves you
          and is proud of you&mdash;as we all are&mdash;and looks forward to your
          great career&mdash;I know it only too well. And now he has this deep
          conviction that he has a call from on High to ruin your career at the very
          beginning. Do understand, Paul, that he feels himself in a very terrible
          position." </p>
        <p>"I do," said Mr. Finn. "God knows that if it weren't for His command, I should
          myself withdraw." </p>
        <p>"I appreciate your position, perfectly," replied Paul, "but that doesn't
          relieve me of my responsibilities." </p>
        <p>Silas Finn rose and locked the fingers of both hands together and stood before
          Paul, with appealing eyes. "My son, after what I have said, you are not going to
          stand against me?" </p>
        <p>Paul rose too. A sudden craze of passion swept him. "My country has been my
          country for thirty years. You have been my father for five minutes. I stand by
          my country." </p>
        <p>Silas Finn turned away and waved a haphazard hand. "And I must stand by my
          God." </p>
        <p>"Very well. That bring; us to our original argument. 'Political foes. Private
          friends.' " </p>
        <p>Silas turned again and looked into the young man's eyes. "But father and son,
          Paul." </p>
        <p>"All the more honourable. There'll be no mud-throwing. The cleanest election of
          the century." </p>
        <p>The elder man again covered his face with both <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0288"
            n="265"/> hands, and his black and white streaked hair fell over his fingers
          and the great diamond in his ring flashed oddly, and he rocked his head for a
          while to and fro. </p>
        <p>"I had a call," he wailed. "I had a call. 1 had a call from God. It was clear.
          It was absolute. But you don't understand these things. His will must prevail.
          It was terrible to think of crushing your career&mdash;my only son's career.
          I brought these two friends to help me persuade you not to oppose me. I did my
          best, Paul. I promised them not to resort to the last argument. But flesh is
          weak. For the first time since&mdash;you know&mdash;the
          knife&mdash;your mother&mdash;I lost self-control. I shall have to
          answer for it to my God&mdash;" He stretched out his arms and looked
          haggardly at Paul. "But it is God's will. It is God's will that I should voice
          His message to the Empire. Paul, Paul, my beloved son&mdash;you cannot flout
          Almighty God." </p>
        <p>"Your God doesn't happen to be my God," said Paul, once more
          suspicious&mdash;and now hideously so&mdash;of religious mania. "And
          possibly the real God is somebody else's God altogether. Anyway, England's the
          only God I've got left, and I'm going to fight for her." </p>
        <p>The door opened and Wilton, the man-servant, appeared. He looked round. "I beg
          your pardon, sir." </p>
        <p>Paul crossed the room. "What is it?" </p>
        <p>"Her Highness, sir," he said in his well-trained, low voice, "and the Colonel
          and Miss Winwood. I told them you were engaged. But they've been waiting for
          over half-an-hour, sir." </p>
        <p>Paul drew himself up. "Why did you not tell me before? Her Highness is not to
          be kept waiting. Present my respectful compliments to Her Highness, and ask her
          and Colonel and Miss Winwood to have the kindness to come upstairs." </p>
        <p>"We had better go," cried Jane in sudden fear. </p>
        <p>"No," said lie. "I want you all to stay."</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XVIII</head>

        <p>IN the tense silence of the few moments of waiting Paul passed from the boy to
          whom the earth had been a fairyland to the man grappling with great realities.
          In those few moments he lived through his past life and faced an adumbration of
          the future. </p>
        <p>The door was thrown open and the Princess appeared, smiling, happy, a black
          ostrich feather in her hat and a sable stole hanging loose from her shoulders; a
          great and radiant lady. Behind her came the Colonel and Ursula Winwood. Paul
          bent over the Princess's, outstretched hand. </p>
        <p>"A thousand pardons for keeping you waiting. I did not know you had come. I was
          engaged with my friends. May I have the honour of presenting them? Princess,
          this is Mr. Silas Finn, the managing director of Fish Palaces Limited. These are
          two very dear friends, Miss Seddon&mdash;Mr. Simmons. Miss Winwood
          &mdash;Colonel Winwood, may I?" </p>
        <p>He waved an introductory hand. The Princess: bowed; then, struck by their
          unsmiling faces and by Paul's strange manner, turned to him quickly. </p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">"'Qu'est ce qu'il y a?"</foreign>
          </hi>

        </p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">"Je vais vous le dire."</foreign>
          </hi>

        </p>
        <p>He pushed a chair. She sat down. Ursula Winwood sat in Paul's writing chair.
          The others remained standing. </p>
        <p>"Mr. Finn called to inform me that he has been adopted as the Liberal candidate
          for Hickney Heath."' "My felicitations," said the Princess. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0290" n="267"/>
        </p>
        <p>Silas bowed to her gravely and addressed Colonel Winwood. </p>
        <p>"We have been, sir&mdash;Mr. Savelli and I&mdash;for some time on terms
          of personal friendship in the constituency." </p>
        <p>"I see, I see," replied the Colonel, though he was somewhat puzzled. "Very
          polite and friendly, I'm sure. " </p>
        <p>"Mr. Finn also urges me to withdraw my candidature," said Paul. </p>
        <p>The Princess gave a little incredulous laugh. Ursula Winwood rose and, with a
          quick protective step, drew nearer Paul. Colonel Winwood frowned. </p>
        <p>"Withdraw? In Heaven's name why?" </p>
        <p>Silas Finn tugged at his black-and-white-streaked beard and looked at his son. </p>
        <p>"Need we go into it again? There are religious reasons, which perhaps,
          Madam"&mdash;Silas addressed the Princess&mdash;"you might
          misunderstand. Mr. Savelli possibly thinks I am a fanatic. I can't help it. I
          have warned him. That is enough. Good-bye, Mr. Savelli." </p>
        <p>He held out his hand; but Paul did not take it. "You forget, Mr. Finn, that I
          asked you to stay." He clutched the sides of his jacket till his knuckles grew
          white, and he set his teeth. "Mr. Finn has another reason for wishing me not to
          oppose him&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"That reason you need never give," cried Silas in a loud voice, and starting
          forward. "You know that I make no claims whatsoever." </p>
        <p>"I know that," said Paul, coldly; "but I am going to give it all the same." He
          paused, held up his hand and looked at the Princess. "Mr. Silas Finn happens to
          be my father." </p>
        <p>"Good God!" gasped the Colonel, after a flash of silence. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0291" n="268"/>
        </p>
        <p>The Princess caught a quick breath and sat erect in her chair. </p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">"Votre P&#x00E8;re, Paul?"</foreign>
          </hi>

        </p>
        <p>"Yes, Princess. Until half an hour ago I did not know it. Never in my life did
          I know that I had a father living. My friends there can bear witness that what I
          say is true." </p>
        <p>"But, Paul dear," said Miss Winwood, laying her kind fingers on his arm and
          searching his face, "you told us that your parents were dead and that they were
          Italians." </p>
        <p>"I lied," replied Paul calmly. "But I honestly believed the woman who was my
          mother not to be my mother, and I had never heard of my father. I had to account
          for myself to you. Your delicacy, Miss Winwood, enabled me to invent as little
          as possible." </p>
        <p>"But your name&mdash;Savelli?" </p>
        <p>"I took it when I went on the stage&mdash;I had a few years' obscure and
          unsuccessful struggle. You will remember I came to you starving and penniless." </p>
        <p>The Princess grew white and her delicate nostrils quivered. </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">"Et monsieur votre p&#x00E8;re&mdash;"</foreign>
          </hi> she checked herself. "And your father, what do you say he is?" </p>
        <p>Paul motioned to Silas to speak. </p>
        <p>"I, Madam," said the latter, "am a self-made man, and by the establishment of
          fried-fish shops all over London and the great provincial towns, have, by the
          grace of God, amassed a considerable fortune." </p>
        <p>"Fried fish?" said the Princess in a queer voice. </p>
        <p>Silas looked at her out of his melancholy and unhumorous eyes. </p>
        <p>"Yes, Madam." </p>
        <p>"I have also learned," said Paul, "that my grandmother was a Sicilian who
          played a street-organ. Hence my Italian blood." <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0292"
            n="269"/>
        </p>
        <p>Jane, standing by the door with Barney Bill, most agonized of old men, wholly
          nervous, twisting with gnarled fingers the broken rim of his hard felt hat,
          turned aside so that no one but Bill should see a sudden gush of tears. For she
          had realized how drab and unimportant she was in the presence of the great and
          radiant lady; also how the great and radiant lady was the God-sent mate for
          Paul, never so great a man as now when he was cutting out his heart for truth's
          sake. </p>
        <p>"I should like to tell you what my life has been," continued Paul, "in the
          presence of those who know it already. That's why I asked them to stay. Until an
          hour ago I lived in dreams. In my own fashion I was an honest man. But now I've
          got this knowledge of my origin, the dreams are swept away and I stand naked to
          myself. If I left you, Miss Winwood, and Colonel Winwood, who have been so good
          to me&mdash;and Her Highness, who has deigned to honour me with her
          friendship&mdash;in a moment's doubt as to my antecedents I should be an
          impostor." </p>
        <p>"No, no, my boy," said Colonel Winwood, who was standing with hands deep in
          trouser pockets and his head bent, staring at the carpet. "No words like that in
          this house. Besides, why should we want to go into all this?" </p>
        <p>He had the Englishman's detestation of unpleasant explanations. Ursula Winwood
          supported him. </p>
        <p>"Yes, why?" she asked. </p>
        <p>"But it would be very interesting," said the Princess slowly, cutting her
          words. </p>
        <p>Paul met her eyes, which she had hardened, and saw beneath them pain and anger
          and wounded pride and repulsion. For a second he allowed an agonized appeal to
          flash through his. He knew that he was deliberately killing the love in her
          heart. He felt the monstrous cruelty of it. A momentary doubt shook <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0293" n="270"/> him. Was he justified? A short while
          ago she had entered the room her face alight with love; now her face was as
          stern and cold as his own. . Had he the right to use the knife like this? Then
          certainty came. It had to be. The swifter the better. She of all human beings
          must no longer be deceived. Before her, at supreme cost, he must stand clean. </p>
        <p>"It's not very interesting," said he. "And it's soon told. I was a ragged boy
          in a slum in a Lancashire town. I slept on sacking in a scullery, and very
          seldom had enough to eat. The woman whom I didn't think was my mother
          ill-treated me. I gather now that she hated me because she hated my father. She
          deserted him when I was a year old and disappeared; she never spoke of him. I
          don't know exactly how old I am. I chose a birthday at random. As a child I
          worked in a factory. You know what child-labour in factories was some years ago.
          I might have been there still, if my dear old friend there hadn't helped me when
          I was thirteen to run away. He used to go through the country in a van selling
          mats and chairs. He brought me to London, and found me a lodging with Miss
          Seddon's mother. So, Miss Seddon and I were children together. I became an
          artist's model. When I grew too old for that to be a dignified ocupation, I went
          on the stage. Then one day, starving and delirious, I stumbled through the gates
          of Drane's Court and fell at Miss Winwood's feet. That's all." </p>
        <p>"Since we've begun, we may as well finish and get it over," said Colonel
          Winwood, still with bent head, but looking at Paul from beneath his eyebrows.
          "When and how did you come across this gentleman who you say is your father?" </p>
        <p>Paul told the story in a few words. </p>
        <p>"And now that you have heard everything," said he, <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0294" n="271"/> would you think me justified in
          withdrawing my candidature?" </p>
        <p>"Certainly not," said the Colonel. "You've got your duty to the Party." </p>
        <p>"And you, Miss Winwood?" </p>
        <p>"Can you ask? You have your duty to the country." </p>
        <p>"And you, Princess?" </p>
        <p>She met his challenging eyes and rose in a stately fashion. </p>
        <p>"I am not equal to these complications of English politics, Mr. Savelli," she
          said. She held herself very erect, but her lips trembled and tears were very
          near her eyes. She turned to Miss Winwood and held out her hand. "I am afraid we
          must postpone our discussion of the Forlorn Widows. It is getting late. <hi
            rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">Au revoir,</foreign>
          </hi> Colonel Winwood&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"I will see you to your carriage." </p>
        <p>On the threshold she turned, included Paul in a vague bow to the company, and
          passed through the door which Colonel Winwood held open. Paul watched her until
          she disappeared&mdash;disappeared haughtily out of his life, taking his
          living heart with her, leaving him with a stone very heavy, very cold, dead. And
          he was smitten as with a great darkness. He remained quite still for a few
          moments after the door had closed, then with a sudden jerk he drew himself up. </p>
        <p>"Mr. Finn," said he, "as I've told you, I address my first meeting to-night. I
          am going to make public the fact that I'm your son." </p>
        <p>Silas put his hand to his head and looked at him wildly. </p>
        <p>"No, no," he muttered hoarsely&mdash;"no." </p>
        <p>"I see no reason," said Miss Winwood gently. </p>
        <p>"I see every reason," said Paul. "I must live in the light now. The truth or
          nothing." </p>
        <p>"Then obey your conscience, Paul," she answered. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0295" n="272"/>
        </p>
        <p>But Silas came forward with his outstretched hands. </p>
        <p>"You can't do it. You can't do it, I tell you. It's impossible." </p>
        <p>"Why?" </p>
        <p>He replied in an odd voice, and with a glance at Miss Winwood. "I must tell you
          afterwards." </p>
        <p>"I will leave you," she said. </p>
        <p>"Mr. Finn"&mdash;she shook hands with him&mdash;"I hope you're proud of
          your son." And then she shook hands with Jane and Barney Bill. "I'm glad to meet
          such old friends of Paul." And to Paul, as he held the door open, she said, her
          clear kind eyes full on him, "Remember, we want men in England." </p>
        <p>"Thank God, we've got women," said he' with lips from which he could not keep a
          sudden quiver. </p>
        <p>He closed the door and came up to his father standing on the hearthrug. </p>
        <p>"And now' why shouldn't I speak? Why shouldn't I be an honest man instead of an
          impostor?" </p>
        <p>"Out of pity for me, my son." </p>
        <p>"Pity? Why, what harm would it do you? There's nothing dishonourable in father
          and son fighting an election." He laughed without much mirth. "It's what some
          people would call sporting. As for me, personally, I don't see why you should be
          ashamed of owning me. My record is clean enough." </p>
        <p>"But mine isn't, Paul," said Silas mournfully. </p>
        <p>For the first time Paul bowed his head. "I'm sorry," said he. "I forgot." Then
          he raised it again. "But that's all over and buried in the past." </p>
        <p>"It may be unburied." </p>
        <p>"How?" </p>
        <p>"Don't you see?" cried Jane. "Even I can. If you spring your relationship upon
          the public, it will create an enormous sensation&mdash;it will set the place
          on fire with curiosity. They'll dig up everything they can <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0296" n="273"/> about you&mdash;everything they can
          about him. Oh, Paul, don't you see. </p>
        <p>"It's up agin a man, sonny," said Barney Bill, limping towards them, "it's up
          agin a candidate, you understand, him not being a Fenian or a Irish patriot,
          that he's been in gaol. Penal servitude ain't a nice state of life to be
          reminded of, sonny. Whereas if you leaves things as they is, nobody's going to
          ask no questions." </p>
        <p>"That's my point," said Silas Finn. </p>
        <p>Paul looked from one to the other, darkly. In a kind of dull fierce passion he
          had made up his mind to clear himself before the world, to rend to tatters his
          garments of romance, to snap his fingers at the stars and destiny and such-like
          deluding toys, to stand a young Ajax defying the thunderbolts. Here came the
          first check. </p>
        <p>"If they found out as how he'd done time, they'd find out for why," said Bill,
          cocking his head earnestly. </p>
        <p>As Paul, engaged in sombre thought, made no reply, Silas turned away, his hands
          uplifted in supplication, and prayed aloud. He had sinned in giving way to his
          anger. He prostrated himself before the divine vengeance. If this was his
          apportioned punishment, might God give him meekness and strength to bear it. The
          tremulous, crying voice, the rapt, fanatical face, and the beseeching attitude
          struck a bizarre note in the comfortable and worldly room. Supported on either
          side by Jane, helpless and anxious' and Barney Bill, crooked, wrinkled, with his
          close-cropped white hair and little liquid diamond eyes, still nervously tearing
          his hat-brim, he looked almost grotesque. To Paul he seemed less a man than a
          creation of another planet, with unknown and incalculable instincts and
          impulses, who had come to earth and with foolish hand had wiped out the meaning
          of existence. Yet he felt no <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0297" n="274"/>
          resentment, but rather a weary pity for the stranger blundering through an
          unsympathetic world. As soon as there came a pause in the prayer, he said not
          ungently: </p>
        <p>"The Almighty is not going to use me as an instrument to punish you, if I can
          help it. I quite appreciate your point. I'll say nothing." </p>
        <p>Barney Bill jerked his thumb towards the chair where the Princess had been
          sitting: </p>
        <p>"She won't give it away?" </p>
        <p>Paul smiled sadly. "No, old man. She'll keep it to herself." </p>
        <p>That marked the end of the interview. Paul accompanied the three downstairs. </p>
        <p>"I meant to act for the best, Paul," said Silas piteously, on parting. "Tell me
          that I haven't made you my enemy." </p>
        <p>"God forbid," said Paul. </p>
        <p>He went slowly up to his room again and threw himself in his writing chair. His
          eye fell upon the notes on the sheet of foolscap. The Radical candidate having
          been chosen, they were no longer relevant to his speech. He crumpled up the
          paper and threw it into the waste-paper basket. His speech! He held his head in
          both hands. A couple of hours hence he would be addressing a vast audience, the
          centre of the hopes of thousands of his fellow countrymen. The thought beat upon
          his brain. He had had the common nightmare of standing with conductor's baton in
          front of a mighty orchestra and being paralyzed by sense of impotence. No less a
          nightmare was his present position. A couple of hours ago he was athrill with
          confidence and joy of battle. But then he was a different man. The morning
          stars, the stars of his destiny, sang together in the ever-deepening glamour of
          the Vision Splendid. He was entering into the lists of <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0298" n="275"/> Camelot to fight for his Princess. He
          was the Mysterious Knight, parented in fairy-far Avilion, the Fortunate Youth,
          the Awakener of England. Now he was but a base-born young man who had attained a
          high position by false pretences; an ordinary adventurer with a glib tongue; a
          self-educated, self-seeking, commonplace fellow. At least, so he saw himself in
          his Princess's eyes. And he had meant that she should thus behold him. No longer
          was he entering lists to fight for her. For what hopeless purpose was he
          entering them? To awaken England? The awakener must have his heart full of
          dreams and visions and glamour and joy and throbbing life; and in his heart
          there was death. </p>
        <p>He drew out the little cornelian talisman at the end of his watch-chain and
          looked at it bitterly. It was but a mocking symbol of illusion. He unhooked it
          and laid it on the table. He would carry it about with him no longer. He would
          throw it away. </p>
        <p>Ursula Winwood quietly entered the room. </p>
        <p>"You must come down and have something to cat before the meeting." </p>
        <p>Paul rose. "I don't want anything, thank you, Miss Winwood." </p>
        <p>"But James and I do. So come and join us." </p>
        <p>"Are you coming to the meeting?" he asked in surprise. </p>
        <p>"Of course." She lifted her eyebrows. "Why not?" </p>
        <p>"After what you have heard?" </p>
        <p>"All the more reason for us to go." She smiled as she had smiled on that
          memorable evening six years ago when she had stood with the horrible pawn-ticket
          in her hand. "James has to support the Party. I have to support you. James will
          do the same as I in a day or two. Just give him time. His mind doesn't work <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0299" n="276"/> very quickly, not as quickly as a
          woman's. Come," she said. "When we have a breathing space you can tell me all
          about it. But in the meantime I'm pretty sure I understand." </p>
        <p>"How can you?" he asked wearily. "You have other traditions." </p>
        <p>"I don't know about traditions; but I don't give my love and take it away
          again. I set rather too much value on it. I understand because I love you." </p>
        <p>"Others with the same traditions can't understand." </p>
        <p>"I'm not proposing to marry you," she said bluntly. "That makes a difference." </p>
        <p>"It does," said he, meeting her eyes unflinchingly. </p>
        <p>"If you weren't a brave man, I shouldn't say such a thing to you. Anyhow I
          understand you're the last man in the world who should take me for a fool." </p>
        <p>"My God!" said Paul in a choky voice. "What can I do to thank you?" </p>
        <p>"Win the election." </p>
        <p>"You are still my dearest lady&mdash;my very very dearest lady," said he. </p>
        <p>Her shrewd eyes fell upon the cornelian heart. She picked it tip and held it
          out to him on her plump palm. </p>
        <p>"Why have you taken this off your watch-chain?" </p>
        <p>"It's a little false god," said he. </p>
        <p>"It's the first thing yon asked for when you recovered from your illness. You
          said you had kept it since you were a tiny boy. See? I remember. You set great
          value on it then?" </p>
        <p>"I believed in it," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"And now you don't? But a woman gave it to you." </p>
        <p>"Yes," said Paul, wondering, in his masculine way, how the deuce she knew that.
          "I was a brat of eleven." </p>
        <p>"Then keep it. Put it on your chain again. I'm sure it's a true little god.
          Take it back to please me." </p>
        <p>As there was nothing, from lapping up Eisel to kill <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0300" n="277"/> ing a crocodile, that Paul would not
          have done, in the fulness of his wondering gratitude, for his dearest lady, he
          meekly attached the heart to his chain and put it in his pocket. </p>
        <p>"I must tell you," said he, "that the lady&mdash;she seemed a goddess to me
          then&mdash;chose me as her champion in a race, a race of urchins at a Sunday
          school treat, and I didn't win. But she gave me the cornelian heart as a prize." </p>
        <p>"But as my champion you will win," said Miss Winwood. "My dear boy," she said,
          and her eyes grew very tender as she laid her hand on the young man's arm,
          "believe what an old woman is telling you is true. Don't throw away any little
          shred of beauty you've ever had in your life. The beautiful things are really
          the true ones, though they may seem to be illusions. Without the trinket or what
          it stood for, would you be here now?" </p>
        <p>"I don't know," replied Paul. "I might have taken a more honest road to get
          here." </p>
        <p>"We took you to ourselves as a bright human being, Paul&mdash;not for what
          you might or might not have been. By the way, what have you decided as regards
          making public the fact of your relationship?" </p>
        <p>"My father, for his own reasons, has urged me not to do so." </p>
        <p>Miss Winwood drew a long breath. </p>
        <p>"I'm glad to hear it," she said. </p>
        <p>So Paul, comforted by one woman's amazing loyalty, went out that evening and
          addressed his great meeting. But the roar of applause that welcomed him echoed
          through void spaces of his being. He felt neither thrill nor fear. The speech
          prepared by the Fortunate Youth was delivered by a stranger to it", glowing and
          dancing eloquence. The words came trippingly enough, but the informing Spirit
          was gone. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0301" n="278"/>
        </p>
        <p>Those in the audience familiar with the magic of his smile were disappointed.
          The soundness of his policy satisfied the hard-headed, but he made no appeal to
          the imaginative. If his speech did not fall flat, it was not the clarion voice
          that his supporters had anticipated. They whispered together with depressed
          headshakings. Their man was not in form. He was nervous. What he said was right
          enough, but his utterance lacked fire. It carried conviction to those already
          convinced; but it could make no proselytes. Had they been mistaken in their
          choice? Too young a man, hadn't lie bitten off a hunk greater than he could
          chew? So the inner ring of local politicians. An election audience, however,
          brings its own enthusiasms, and it must be a very dull dog indeed who damps
          their ardour. They cheered prodigiously when Paul sat down, and a crowd of
          zealots waiting outside the building cheered him again as he drove off. But Paul
          knew that he had been a failure. He had delivered another man's speech.
          To-morrow and the day after and the day after that, and ever afterwards, if he
          held to the political game, he would have to speak in his own new person. What
          kind of a person would the new Paul be? </p>
        <p>He drove back almost in silence with the Colonel and Miss Winwood, vainly
          seeking to solve the problem. The foundations of his life had been swept away.
          His foot rested on nothing solid save his own manhood. That no shock should
          break down. He would fight. He would win the election. He set his lips in grim
          determination. If life held no higher meaning, it at least offered this
          immediate object for existence. Besides he owed the most strenuous effort of his
          soul to the devoted and loyal woman whose face he saw dimly opposite. Afterwards
          come what might. The Truth at any rate. <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="la"> Magna est veritas et pr&aelig;valebit.</foreign>
          </hi>
        </p>
        <p>These were "prave 'orts" and valorous protestations. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0302" n="279"/>
        </p>
        <p>But when their light supper was over and Colonel Winwood had retired, Ursula
          Winwood lingered in the dining room, her heart aching for the boy who looked so
          stern and haggard. She came behind him and touched his hair. </p>
        <p>"Poor boy," she murmured. </p>
        <p>Then Paul&mdash;he was very young, barely thirty&mdash;broke down, as
          perhaps she meant that he should, and, elbows sprawling amid the disarray of the
          meal, poured out all the desolation of his soul, and for the first time cried
          out in anguish for the woman he had lost. So, as love lay a-bleeding mortally
          pierced, Ursula Win wood wept unaccustomed tears and with tender fingers strove
          to staunch the wound.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XIX</head>

        <p>DAYS of strain followed: days of a thousand engagements, a thousand interviews,
          a thousand journeyings, a thousand speeches; days in which he was reduced to an
          unresisting automaton, mechanically uttering the same formulas; days in which
          the irresistible force of the campaign swept him along without volition. And day
          followed day and not a sign came from the Princess Zobraska either of
          condonation or resentment. It was as though she had gathered her skirts around
          her and gone disdainfully out of his life for ever. If speaking were to be done,
          it was for her to speak. Paul could not plead. It was he who, in a way, had cast
          her off. In effect he had issued the challenge: "I am a child of the gutter, an
          adventurer masquerading under an historical name, and you are a royal princess.
          Will you marry me now?" She had given her answer, by walking out of the room,
          her proud head in the air. It was final, as far as he was concerned. He could do
          nothing&mdash;not even beg his dearest lady to plead for him. Besides,
          rumour had it that the Princess had cancelled her town engagements and gone to
          Morebury. So he walked in cold and darkness, uninspired, and though he worked
          with feverish energy, the heart and purpose of his life were gone. </p>
        <p>As in his first speech, so in his campaign, he failed. He had been chosen for
          his youth, his joyousness, his magnetism, his radiant promise of great things to
          come. He went about the constituency an, anxious, <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0304" n="281"/> haggard man, working himself to death
          without being able to awaken a spark of emotion in the heart of anybody. He lost
          ground daily. On the other hand, Silas Finn, with his enthusiasms, and his
          aspect of an inspired prophet, made alarming progress. He swept the multitude.
          Paul Savelli, the young man of the social moment, had an army of helpers,
          members of Parliament making speeches, friends on the Unionist press writing
          flamboyant leaders, fair ladies in automobiles hunting for voters through the
          slums of Hickney Heath. Silas Finn had scarcely a personal friend. But hope
          reigned among his official supporters, whereas depression began to descend over
          Paul's brilliant host. </p>
        <p>"They want stirring up a bit," said the Conservative agent despondently. "I
          hear old Finn's meetings go with a bang. They nearly raised the roof off last
          night. We want some roof-raising on this side." </p>
        <p>"I do my best," said Paul coldly, but the reproach cut deep. He was a failure.
          No nervous or intellectual effort could save him now, though he spent himself to
          the last heartbeat. He was the sport of a mocking Will o' the Wisp which he had
          taken for Destiny. </p>
        <p>Once on coming out of his headquarters he met Silas, who was walking up the
          street with two or three of his committee-men. In accordance with the ordinary
          amenities of English political life, the two candidates shook hands, and
          withdrew a pace or two aside to chat for a while. This was the first time they
          had come together since the afternoon of revelation, and there was a moment of
          constraint during which Silas tugged at his streaked beard and looked with
          mournful wistfulness at his son. </p>
        <p>"I wish I were not your opponent, Paul," said he in a low voice, so as not to
          be overheard. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0305" n="282"/>
        </p>
        <p>"That doesn't matter a bit," Paul replied courteously. "I see you're putting up
          an excellent fight." </p>
        <p>"It's the Lord's battle. If it weren't, do you think I would not let you win?" </p>
        <p>The same old cry. Through sheer repetition, Paul began almost to believe in it.
          He felt very weary. In his father's eyes he recognized, with a pang, the glow of
          a faith which he had lost. Their likeness struck him, and he saw himself, his
          old self, beneath the unquestioning though sorrowful eyes. </p>
        <p>"That's the advantage of a belief in the Almighty's personal interest," he
          answered, with a touch of irony: "whatever happens, one is not easily
          disillusioned." </p>
        <p>"That is true, my son," said Silas. </p>
        <p>"Jane is well?" Paul asked, after an instant's pause, breaking off the
          profitless discussion. </p>
        <p>"Very well." </p>
        <p>"And Barney Bill?" </p>
        <p>"He upbraids me bitterly for what I have said." </p>
        <p>Paul smiled at the curiously stilted phrase. </p>
        <p>"Tell him from me not to do it. My love to them both. " </p>
        <p>They shook hands again, and Paul drove off in the motor car that had been
          placed at his disposal during the election, and Silas continued his sober walk
          with his committee-men up the muddy street. Whereupon Paul conceived a sudden
          hatred for the car. It was but the final artistic touch to this comedy of
          mockery of which he had been the victim. . . . Perhaps God was on his father's
          side, after all&mdash;on the side of them who humbly walked and not of them
          who rode in proud chariots. But his political creed, his sociological
          convictions rose in protest. How could the Almighty be in league with all that
          was subversive of social order, all that was destructive to Imperial cohesion,
          all that which inevitably tended to England's downfall? <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0306" n="283"/>
        </p>
        <p>He turned suddenly to his companion, the Conservative agent. </p>
        <p>"Do you think God has got common sense?" </p>
        <p>The agent, not being versed in speculations regarding the attributes of the
          Deity, stared; then, disinclined to commit himself, took refuge in platitude. </p>
        <p>"God moves in a mysterious way, Mr. Savelli." </p>
        <p>"That's rot," said Paul. "If there's an Almighty, He must move in a
          common-sense way; otherwise the whole of this planet would have busted up long
          ago. Do you think it's common sense to support the present Government?" </p>
        <p>"Certainly not," said the agent, fervently. </p>
        <p>"Then if God supported it, it wouldn't be common sense on His part. It would be
          merely mysterious?" </p>
        <p>"I see what you're driving at," said the agent. "Our opponent undoubtedly has
          been making free with the name of the Almighty in his speeches. As a matter of
          fact he's rather crazy on the subject. I don't think it would be a bad move to
          make a special reference to it. It's all damned hypocrisy. There's a chap in the
          old French play&mdash;what's his name?" </p>
        <p>"Tartuffe." </p>
        <p>"That's it. Well, there you are. That speech of his yesterday&mdash;now why
          don't you take it and wring religiosity and hypocrisy and Tartuffism out of it?
          You know how to do that sort of thing. You can score tremendously. I never
          thought of it before. By George! you can get him in the neck if you like." </p>
        <p>"But I don't like," said Paul. "I happen to know that Mr. Finn is sincere in
          his convictions." </p>
        <p>"But, my dear sir, what does his supposed sincerity matter in political
          contest?" </p>
        <p>"It's the difference between dirt and cleanliness," said Paul. "Besides, as I
          told you at the outset, Mr. Finn and I are close personal friends, and I have
          the <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0307" n="284"/> highest regard for his character.
          He has seen that his side has scrupulously refrained from personalities with
          regard to me, and I insist on the same observance with regard to him." </p>
        <p>"With all due deference to you, Mr. Savelli, you were called only the day
          before yesterday 'the spoiled darling of Duchesses' boudoirs.' " </p>
        <p>"It wasn't with Mr. Finn's cognizance. I've found that out." </p>
        <p>"Well," said the agent, leaning back-in the luxurious limousine, "I don't see
          why somebody, without your cognizance, shouldn't call Mr. Finn the spoiled
          minion of the Almighty's ante-chamber. That's a devilish good catch-phrase," he
          added, starting forward in the joy of his newborn epigram. : 'Devilish good.
          'The spoiled minion of the Almighty's ante-chamber.' It'll become historical." </p>
        <p>"If it does," said Paul, "it will be associated with the immediate retirement
          of the Conservative candidate." </p>
        <p>"Do you really mean that?" </p>
        <p>It was Paul's turn to start forward. "My dear Wilson," said he, "if you or
          anybody else thinks I'm a man to talk through his hat, I'll retire at once. I
          don't care a damn about myself. Not a little tuppenny damn. What the devil does
          it matter to me whether I get into Parliament or not? Nothing. Not a tuppenny
          damn. You can't understand. It's the party and the country. For myself,
          personally, the whole thing can go to blazes. I'm in earnest, dead earnest," he
          continued, with a vehemence incomprehensible to Wilson. "If anybody doesn't
          think so, I'll clear out at once"&mdash;he snapped his fingers. "But while
          I'm candidate everything I say I mean. I mean it intensely&mdash;with all my
          soul. And I say that if there's a single insulting reference to Mr. Finn during
          this election, <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0308" n="285"/> you'll be up against
          the wreck of your own political career. </p>
        <p>The agent watched the workings of his candidate's dark clear-cut face. He was
          very proud of his candidate, and found it difficult to realize that there were
          presumably sane people who would not vote for him on sight. A lingering memory
          of grammar school days flashed on him when he told his wife later of the
          conversation, and he likened Paul to a wrathful Apollo. Anxious to appease the
          god, he said humbly: </p>
        <p>"It was the merest of suggestions, Mr. Savelli. Heaven knows we don't want to
          descend to personalities, and your retirement would be an unqualifiable
          disaster. But&mdash;you'll pardon my mentioning it&mdash;you began this
          discussion by asking me whether the Almighty had common sense." </p>
        <p>"Well, has He or not?" </p>
        <p>"Of course," said Wilson. </p>
        <p>"Then we're going to win this election," said Paul. </p>
        <p>If he could have met enthusiasm with enthusiasm, all would have been well. The
          awakener of England could have captivated hearts by glowing pictures of a great
          and glorious future. It would have been a counter-blaze to that lit by his
          opponent, which flamed in all the effulgence of a reckless reformer's promise,
          revealing a Utopia in which there would be no drunkenness, no crime, no poverty,
          and in which the rich, apparently, would have to work very hard in order to
          support the poor in comfortable idleness. But beyond proving fallacies, Paul
          could do nothing&mdash;and even then, has there ever been a mob since the
          world began susceptible to logical argument? So, all through the wintry days of
          the campaign, Silas Finn carried his fiery cross through the constituency,
          winning frenzied adherents, while Paul found it hard to rally the faithful round
          the drooping standard of St. George. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0309" n="286"/>
        </p>
        <p>The days went on. Paul addressed his last meeting on the eve of the poll. By a
          supreme effort he regained some of his former fire and eloquence. He drove home
          exhausted, and going straight to bed slept like a dog till morning. </p>
        <p>The servant who woke him brought a newspaper to the bedside. </p>
        <p>"Something to interest you, sir." </p>
        <p>Paul looked at the headline indicated by the man. </p>
        <p>"Hickney Heath Election. Liberal Candidate's Confession. Extraordinary Scene." </p>
        <p>He glanced hurriedly down the column and read with amazement and stabbing pain
          the matter that was of interest. The worst had happened&mdash;the thing
          which during all his later life Silas Finn had feared. The spectre of the prison
          had risen up against him. </p>
        <p>Towards the end of Silas Finn's speech, at his last great meeting, a man,
          sitting in the body of the hall near the platform, got up and interrupted him.
          "What about your own past life? What about your three years' penal servitude?"
          All eyes were turned from the man&mdash;a common looking, evil
          man&mdash;to the candidate, who staggered as if he had been shot, caught at
          the table behind him for support and stared in greyfaced terror. There was an
          angry tumult, and the interrupter would have fared badly, but for Silas Finn
          holding up his hand and imploring silence. </p>
        <p>"I challenge the candidate to deny," said the man, as soon as he could be
          heard, "that his real name is Silas Kegworthy, and that he underwent three
          years' penal servitude for murderously assaulting his wife." </p>
        <p>Then the candidate braced himself and said: "The bare facts are true. But I
          have lived stainlessly in the fear of God and in the service of humanity for
          thirty years. I have sought absolution for a moment of mad anger under awful
          provocation in unremitting <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0310" n="287"/> prayer and
          in trying to save the souls and raise the fortunes of my fellow-men. Is that all
          you have against me?" </p>
        <p>"That's all," said the man. </p>
        <p>"It is for you, electors of Hickney Heath, to judge me." </p>
        <p>He sat down amid tumultuous cheers, and the man who had interrupted him, after
          some rough handling, managed to make his escape. The chairman then put a vote of
          confidence in the candidate, which was carried by acclamation, and the meeting
          broke up. </p>
        <p>Such were the essential facts in the somewhat highly coloured newspaper story
          which Paul read in stupefied horror. He dressed quickly and went to his
          sitting-room, where he rang tip his father's house on the telephone. Jane's
          voice met his ear. </p>
        <p>"It's Paul speaking," he replied. "I've just this moment read of last night.
          I'm shaken to my soul. How is my father?" </p>
        <p>"He's greatly upset," came the voice. "He didn't sleep all night, and he's not
          at all well this morning. Oh, it was a cruel, cowardly blow." </p>
        <p>"Dastardly. Do you know who it was?" </p>
        <p>"No. Don't you?" </p>
        <p>"I? Does either of you think that I&mdash;?" </p>
        <p>"No, no," came the voice, now curiously tearful. "I didn't mean that. I forgot
          you've not had time to find out." </p>
        <p>"Who does he think it was?" </p>
        <p>"Some old fellow prisoner who had a grudge against him." </p>
        <p>"Were you at the meeting?" </p>
        <p>"Yes. Oh, Paul, it was splendid to see him face the audience. He spoke so
          simply and with such sorrowful dignity. He had their sympathy at once. But it
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0311" n="288"/> has broken him. I'm afraid he'll
          never be the same man again. After all these years it's dreadful." </p>
        <p>"It's all that's damnable. It's tragic. Give him my love and tell him that
          words can't express my sorrow and indignation." </p>
        <p>He rang off. Almost immediately Wilson was announced. He carne into the room
          radiant. </p>
        <p>"You were right about the divine common-sensicality," said he. "The Lord has
          delivered our adversary into our hands with a vengeance." </p>
        <p>He was a chubby little man of forty, with coarse black hair and scrubby
          moustache, not of the type that readily appreciates the delicacies of a
          situation. Paul conceived a sudden loathing for him. </p>
        <p>"I would give anything for it not to have happened," he said. </p>
        <p>Wilson opened his eyes. "Why? It's our salvation. An ex-convict&mdash;it's
          enough to damn any candidate. But we want to make sure. Now I've got an idea." </p>
        <p>Paul turned on him angrily. "I'll have no capital made out of it whatsoever.
          It's a foul thing to bring such an accusation up against a man who has lived a
          spotless life for thirty years. Everything in me goes out in sympathy with him,
          and I'll let it be known all through the constituency." </p>
        <p>"If you take it that way," said Wilson, "there's no more to be done." </p>
        <p>"There's nothing to be done, except to find out who put up the man to make the
          announcement." </p>
        <p>"He did it on his own," Wilson replied warmly. "None of our people would resort
          to a dirty trick like that." </p>
        <p>"And yet you want me to take advantage of it now it's done." </p>
        <p>"That's quite a different matter." <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0312" n="289"/>
        </p>
        <p>"I can't see much difference," said Paul. </p>
        <p>So Wilson, seeing that his candidate was more unmanageable than ever, presently
          departed, and Paul sat down to breakfast. But he could not eat. He was both
          stricken with shame and moved to the depths by immense pity. Far removed from
          him as Silas Finn was in mode of life and ideals, he found much in common with
          his father. Each had made his way from the slum, each had been guided by an
          inner light&mdash;was Silas Finn's fantastic belief less of an <hi
            rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="la">ignis fatuus</foreign>
          </hi> than his own?&mdash;each had sought to get away from a past, each was
          a child of Ishmael, each, in his own way, had lived romantically. Whatever
          resentment against his father lingered in his heart now melted away. He was very
          near him. The shame of the prison struck him as it had struck the old man. He
          saw him bowed down under the blow, and he clenched his hands in a torture of
          anger and indignation. And to crown all, came the intolerable conviction, in the
          formation of which Wilson's triumphant words had not been necessary, that if he
          won the election it would be due to this public dishonouring of his own father.
          He walked about the room in despair, and at last halted before the mantelpiece
          on which still stood the photograph of the Princess in its silver frame.
          Suddenly he remembered that he had not told her of this incident in his family
          history. She too would be reading her newspaper this morning. He saw her proud
          lips curl. The son of a gaol-bird! He tore the photograph from its frame and
          threw it into the fire and watched it burn. As the paper writhed under the heat,
          the lips seemed to twist into sad reproach. He turned away impatiently. That
          romantic madness was over and done with. He had far sterner things to do than
          shriek his heart out over a woman in an alien star. He had his life to
          reconstruct in the darkness threatening and <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0313"
            n="290"/> mocking; but at last he had truth for a foundation; on that he would
          build in defiance of the world. </p>
        <p>In the midst of these fine thoughts it occurred to him that he had hidden the
          prison episode in his father's career from the Winwoods as well as from the
          Princess. His checks flushed; it was one more strain on the loyalty of these
          dear devoted friends. He went downstairs, and found the Colonel and Miss Winwood
          in the dining-room. Their faces were grave. He came to them with outstretched
          arms&mdash;a familiar gesture, one doubtless inherited from his Sicilian
          ancestry. </p>
        <p>"You see what has happened. I knew all the time. I didn't tell you. You must
          forgive me." </p>
        <p>"I don't blame you, my boy," said Colonel Winwood. "It was your father's
          secret. You had no right to tell us." </p>
        <p>"We're very grieved, dear, for both your sakes," Ursula added. "James has taken
          the liberty of sending round a message of sympathy." </p>
        <p>As ever, these two had gone a point beyond his anticipation of their loyalty.
          He thanked them simply. </p>
        <p>"It's hateful," said he, "to think I may win the election on account of this.
          It's loathsome." He shuddered. </p>
        <p>"I quite agree with you," said the Colonel. "But in politics one has often to
          put up with hateful things in order to serve one's country. That's the sacrifice
          a high-minded man is called upon to make." </p>
        <p>"Besides," said Miss Winwood, "let us hope it won't affect votes. All the
          papers say that the vote of confidence was passed amid scenes of enthusiasm." </p>
        <p>Paul smiled. They understood. A little while later they drove off with him to
          his committee room in the motor car gay with his colours. There was still much
          to be done that day.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XX</head>

        <p>HICKNEY HEATH blazed with excitement. It is not every day that a thrill runs
          through a dull London borough, not even every election day. For a London
          borough, unlike a country town, has very little corporate life of its own. You
          cannot get up as much enthusiasm for Kilburn, say, as a social or historical
          entity, as you can for Winchester or Canterbury. You may perform civic duties,
          if you are public-spirited enough, with business-like zeal, and if you are
          borough councillor you may be proud of the nice new public baths which you have
          been instrumental in presenting to the community. But the ordinary man in the
          street no more cares for Kilburn than he does for Highgate. He would move from
          one to the other without a pang. For neither's glory would he shed a drop of his
          blood. Only at election times does it occur to him that he is one of a special
          brotherhood, isolated from the rest of London; and even then he regards the
          constituency as a convention defining. geographical limits for the momentary
          range of his political passions. So that the day when an electric thrill ran
          through the whole of Hickney Heath was a rare one in its uninspiring annals. </p>
        <p>The dramatic had happened, touching the most sluggish imaginations. The Liberal
          candidate for Parliament, a respected Borough Councillor, a notorious
          Evangelical preacher, had publicly confessed himself an ex-convict. Every
          newspaper in London&mdash;and for the matter of that, every newspaper in
          Great Britain&mdash; <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0315" n="292"/> rang with
          the story, and every man, woman and child in Hickney Heath read feverishly every
          newspaper, morning and evening, they could lay their hands on. Also, every man,
          woman and child in Hickney Heath asked his neighbour for further details. All
          who could leave desk and shop or factory poured into the streets to learn the
          latest, tidings. Around the various polling stations the crowd was thickest.
          Those electors who had been present at Silas Finn's meeting, the night before,
          told the story at first-hand to eager groups. Rumours of every sort spread
          through the mob. The man who had put the famous question was an agent of the
          Tories. It was a smart party move. Silas Finn had all the time been leading a
          double life. Depravities without number were laid to his charge. Even now the
          police were inquiring into his connection with certain burglaries that had taken
          place in the neighbourhood. And where was he that day? Who had seen him? He was
          at home drunk. He had committed suicide. Even if he hadn't, and was elected, he
          would not be allowed to take his seat in Parliament. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, those in whose Radical bosoms burned fierce hatred for the
          Tories, spoke loud in condemnation of their cowardly tactics. There was
          considerable free-fighting in the ordinarily dismal and decorous streets of
          Hickney Heath. Noisy acclamations hailed the automobiles, carriages and
          waggonettes bringing voters of both parties to the polls. Paul, driving in his
          gaily-decked car about the constituency, shared all these demonstrations and
          heard these rumours. The latter he denied and caused to be denied, as far as lay
          in his power. In the broad High Street, thronged with folk, and dissonant with
          tram cars and motor 'buses, he came upon a quarrelsome crowd looking up at a
          window above a poulterer's shop, from which hung something white, like a strip
          of wall paper. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0316" n="293"/>
        </p>
        <p>Approaching, he perceived that it bore a crude drawing of a convict and "Good
          old Dartmoor" for legend. White with anger, he stopped the car, leaped out on to
          the curb, and pushing his way through the crowd, entered the shop. He seized one
          of the white-coated assistants by the arm. "Show me the way to that first-floor
          room," he cried fiercely. </p>
        <p>The assistant, half-dragged, half-leading, and wholly astonished, took him
          through the shop and pointed to the staircase. Paul sprang up and dashed through
          the door into the room, which appeared to be some business office. Three or four
          young men, who turned grinning from the window, be thrust aside, and plucking
          the offending strip from the drawing-pins which secured it to the sill, he tore
          it across and across. </p>
        <p>"You cads! You brutes!" he shouted, trampling on the fragments. "Can't you
          fight like Englishmen?" </p>
        <p>The young men, realizing the identity of the wrathful apparition, stared
          open-mouthed, turned red, and said nothing. Paul strode out, looking very
          fierce, and drove off in his car amid the cheers of the crowd, to which he paid
          no notice. </p>
        <p>"It makes me sick!" he cried passionately to Wilson, who was with him. "I hope
          to God he wins in spite, of it!" </p>
        <p>"What about the party?" asked Wilson. </p>
        <p>Paul damned the party. He was in the overwrought mood in which a man damns
          everything. Quagmire and bramble and the derision of Olympus-that was the end of
          his vanity of an existence. Suppose he was elected&mdash;what then? He would
          be a failure-the high gods in their mirth would see to that&mdash;a puppet
          in Frank Ayres' hands until the next general election, when be would have
          ignominiously to retire. Awakener of England indeed! He could not even awaken
          Hickney Heath. As he dashed through the streets in <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0317" n="294"/> his triumphal car, he hated Hickney
          Heath, hated the wild "hoorays" of waggon-loads of his supporters on their way
          to the polls, hated the smug smiles of his committee-men at polling stations. He
          forgot that he did not hate England. A little black disk an inch or two in
          diameter if cunningly focussed can obscure the sun in heaven from human eye.
          There was England still behind the little black disk, though Paul for the moment
          saw it not. </p>
        <p>Wilson pulled his scrubby moustache and made no retort to Paul's anathema. To
          him Paul was one of the fine flower of the Upper Classes to which lower
          middle-class England still, with considerable justification, believes to be
          imbued with incomprehensible and unalterable principles of conduct. The grand
          old name of gentleman still has its magic in this country&mdash;and is, by
          the way, not without its influence in one or two mighty republics wherein the
          equality of man is very loudly proclaimed. Wilson, therefore, gladly suffered
          Paul's lunatic Quixotry. For himself he approved hugely of the cartoon. If he
          could have had his way, Hickney Heath would have flamed with poster
          reproductions of it. But he had a dim appreciation of, and a sneaking admiration
          for, the aristocrat's point of view, and, being a practical man, evaded a
          discussion on the ethics of the situation. </p>
        <p>The situation was rendered more extraordinary because the Liberal candidate
          made no appearance in the constituency. Paul inquired anxiously. No one had seen
          him. After lunch he drove alone to his father's house. The parlour-maid showed
          him into the hideously furnished and daub-hung dining-room. The Viennese horrors
          of plaster stags, gnomes and rabbits stared fatuously on the hearth. No fire was
          in the grate. Very soon Jane entered, tidy, almost matronly in buxom primness,
          her hair as faultless as if it had come <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0318" n="295"
          /> out of a convoluted mould, her grave eyes full of light. She gave him her
          capable hand. </p>
        <p>"It's like you to come, Paul." </p>
        <p>"It's only decent. My father hasn't shown up. What's the matter with him?" </p>
        <p>"It's a bit of a nervous breakdown," she said, looking at him steadily.
          "Nothing serious. But the doctor&mdash;I sent for him&mdash;says he had
          better rest&mdash;and his committee people thought it wiser for him not to
          show himself." </p>
        <p>"Can I see him?" </p>
        <p>"Certainly not." A look of alarm came into her face. "You're both too excited.
          What would you say to him?" </p>
        <p>"I'd tell him what I feel about the whole matter." </p>
        <p>"Yes. You would fling your arms about, and he would talk about God, and a
          precious lot of good it would do to anybody. No, thank you. I'm in charge of Mr.
          Finn's health." </p>
        <p>It was the old Jane, so familiar. "I wish," said he, with a smile&mdash;"I
          wish I had had your common sense to guide me all these years." </p>
        <p>"If you had, you would now be a clerk in the City earning thirty shillings a
          week." </p>
        <p>"And perhaps a happier man." </p>
        <p>"Bosh, my dear Paul!" she said, shaking her head slowly. "Rot! Rubbish! I know
          you too well. You adding up figures at thirty shillings a week, with a common
          sense wife for I suppose you mean that&mdash;mending your socks and rocking
          the cradle in a second-floor back in Hickney Heath! No, my dear"&mdash;she
          paused for a second or two and her lips twitched oddly&mdash;"common sense
          would have been the death of you." </p>
        <p>He laughed in spite of himself. It was so true. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0319" n="296"/>
        </p>
        <p>Common sense might have screwed him to a thirty shillings-a-week desk: the
          fantastic had brought him to that very house, a candidate for Parliament, in a
          thousand-guinea motor car. On the other hand&mdash;and his laughter faded
          from his eyes&mdash;the fantastic in his life was dead. Henceforward common
          sense would hold him in her cold and unstimulating clasp. He said something of
          the sort to Jane. Once more she ejaculated "Rot, rubbish and bosh!" and they
          quarrelled as they had done in their childhood. </p>
        <p>"You talk as if I didn't know you inside out, my dear Paul," she said in her
          clear, unsmiling way. "Listen. All men are donkeys, aren't they?" </p>
        <p>"For the sake of argument, I agree." </p>
        <p>"Well&mdash;there are two kinds of donkeys. One kind is meek and mild and
          will go wherever it is driven. The other, in order to get along, must always
          have a bunch of carrots dangling before its eyes. That's you." </p>
        <p>"But confound it all!" he cried, "I've lost my carrots&mdash;can't you see?
          I'll never have any carrots again. That's the whole damned tragedy." </p>
        <p>For the first time she smiled&mdash;the smile of the woman wiser in certain
          subtle things than the man. "my dear," she said, "carrots are cheap." She paused
          for an instant and added, "Thank God!" </p>
        <p>Paul squeezed her arms affectionately and they moved apart. He sighed. "They're
          the most precious things in the world," said he. </p>
        <p>"The most precious things in the world are those which you can get for
          nothing," said Jane. </p>
        <p>"You're a dear," said he, "and a comfort." </p>
        <p>Presently he left her and returned to his weary round of the constituency,
          feeling of stouter heart, with a greater faith in the decent ordering of mundane
          things. .A world containing such women as Jane and Ursula <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0320" n="297"/> Winwood possessed elements of sanity.
          Outside one of the polling stations he found Barney Bill holding forth excitedly
          to a knot of working-men. He ceased as the car drove up, and cast back a broad
          proud smile at the candidate's warm greeting. </p>
        <p>"I got up the old 'bus so nice and proper, with all your colours and posters,
          and it would have been a spectacular Diorama for these 'ere poor people; but you
          know for why I didn't bring it out to-day, don't you, sonny?" </p>
        <p>"I know, dear old friend," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"I 'adn't the 'cart to." </p>
        <p>"What were you speechifying about when I turned up?" </p>
        <p>Barney Bill jerked a backward thumb. "I was telling this pack of cowardly
          Radicals that though I've been a Tory born and bred for sixty odd years, and
          though I've voted for you, Silas Finn, for all he was in prison while most of
          them were sucking wickedness and Radicalism out of Nature's founts, is just as
          good a man as what you are. They was saying, yer see, they was Radicals, but on
          account of Silas being blown upon, they was going to vote for you. So I tells
          'em, I says, 'Mr. Savelli would scorn your dirty votes. If yer feel low and
          Radical, vote Radical. Mr. Savelli wants to play fair. I know both of 'em,' I
          says, 'both of 'em intimately.' And they begins to laugh, as if I was talking
          through my hat. Anyway, they see now I know you, sonny." </p>
        <p>Paul laughed and clapped the loyal old man on the shoulder. Then he turned to
          the silent but interested group. "Gentlemen," said he, "I don't want to inquire
          on which side you are; but you can take it from me that whatever my old friend
          Mr. Simmons says about Mr. Finn and myself is the absolute truth. If you're on
          Mr. Finn's side in politics, in God's name vote for <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0321" n="298"/> him. He's a noble, high-souled man and
          I'm proud of his private friendship." </p>
        <p>He drew Barney Bill apart. "You're the only Tory in the place who can try to
          persuade people not to vote for me. I wish you would keep on doing it." </p>
        <p>"I've been a-doing of it ever since the polls opened this morning," said Barney
          Bill. Then he cocked his head on one side and his little eyes twinkled: "It's an
          upside-down way of fighting an election to persuade people not to vote for you,
          isn't it?" </p>
        <p>"Everything is topsy-turvy with me, these days," Paul replied: "so we've just
          got to stand on our heads and make the best of it." </p>
        <p>And he drove off in the gathering dusk. </p>
        <p>Night found him in the great chamber of the Town Hall, with his agent and
          members of his committee. Present too were the Liberal Agent and the members of
          the Liberal Committee. At one end of the room sat the Mayor of the Borough in
          robe and chain of office, presiding over the proceedings. The Returning Officer
          and his staff sat behind long tables, on which were deposited the sealed ballot
          boxes brought in from the various polling stations; and these were emptied and
          the votes were counted, the voting papers for each candidate being done up in
          bundles of fifty. Knots of committee-men of both parties stood chatting in low
          voices. In an ordinary election both candidates would have chatted together, in
          ninety-nine cases out of a hundred about golf, and would have made an engagement
          to meet again in milder conflict that day week. But here Paul was the only
          candidate to appear, and he sat in a cane-bottomed chair apart from the lounging
          politicians, feeling curiously an interloper in this vast, solemn and
          scantily-filled hall. He was very tired, too tired in body, mind and soul to
          join in the <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0322" n="299"/> small-talk of Wilson and
          his bodyguard. Besides, they all wore the air of anticipated victory, and for
          that he held them in detestation. He had detested them the whole day long. The
          faces that yesterday had been long and anxious to-day had been wreathed in
          smirks. Wherever he had gone he had found promise of victory in his father's
          disgrace. Passionately the young man, fronting vital issues, longed for his own
          defeat. </p>
        <p>But for the ironical interposition of the high gods, it might have been so
          different. Any other candidate against him, he himself buoyed up with his own
          old glorious faith, his Princess, dazzling meteor illuminating the murky
          streets&mdash;dear God! what would not have been the joy of battle during
          the past week, what would not have been the intense thrill, the living of a
          thousand lives in these few hours of suspense now so dull with dreariness and
          pain! He sat apart, his legs crossed, a hand over his eyes. Wilson and his men,
          puzzled by his apparent apathy, left him alone. It is not much use addressing a
          mute and wooden idol, no matter how physically prepossessing. </p>
        <p>The counting went on slowly, relentlessly, and the bundles of fifty on each
          side grew in bulk, and Paul's side bulked larger than Silas Finn's. </p>
        <p>At last Wilson could stand it no longer. He left the group with which he was
          talking, and came to Paul. "We're far ahead already," he cried excitedly. ."I
          told you last night would do the trick." </p>
        <p>"Last night," said Paul, rising and stuffing his hands in his jacket pockets,
          "my opponent's supporters passed a vote of confidence in him in a scene of
          tumultuous enthusiasm." </p>
        <p>"Quite so," replied Wilson. "A crowd is generous and easily swayed. A
          theatrical audience of scalliwags and thieves will howl applause at the triumph
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0323" n="300"/> of virtue and the downfall of the
          villain; and each separate member will go out into the street and begin to
          practise villainy and say 'to hell with virtue.' If last night's meeting could
          have polled on the spot, they would have been as one man. To-day they're
          scattered and each individual revises his excited opinion. Your hard-bitten
          Radical would sooner have a self-made man than an aristocrat to represent him in
          Parliament; but, damn it all, he'd sooner have an aristocrat than an
          ex-convict." </p>
        <p>"But who the devil told you I'm an aristocrat?" cried Paul. </p>
        <p>Wilson laughed. "Who wants to be told such an obvious thing? Anyhow, you've
          only got to look and you'll see how the votes are piling tip." </p>
        <p> Paul looked and saw that Wilson spoke truly. Then he reflected that Wilson and
          the others who had worked so strenuously for him had no part in his own personal
          depression. They deserved a manifestation of interest, also expressions of
          gratitude. So Paul pulled himself together and went amongst them and was
          responsive to their prophecies of victory. </p>
        <p>Then just as the last votes were being counted, an official attendant came in
          with a letter for Paul. It had been brought by messenger. The writing on the
          envelope was Jane's. He tore it open and read. </p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="italic">Mr. Finn is dying. He has had a stroke. The doctor says he
            can't live through the night. Come as soon as you can.<lb/> JANE.</hi>

        </p>
        <p>Outside the Town Hall the wide street was packed with people. Men surged tip to
          the hollow square of police guarding the approach to the flight of steps and the
          great entrance door. Men swarmed about the electric standards above the heads of
          their fellows. Men <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0324" n="301"/> rose in a long
          tier with their backs to the shop-fronts on the opposite side of the road. In
          spite of the raw night the windows were open and the arc lights revealed a
          ghostly array of faces looking down on the mass below, whose faces in their turn
          were lit up by the more yellow glare streaming from the doors and uncurtained
          windows of the Town Hall. In the lobby behind the glass doors could be seen a
          few figures going and coming, committee-men, journalists, officials. A fine rain
          began to fall, but the crowd did not heed it. The mackintosh capes of the
          policemen glistened. It was an orderly crowd, held together by tense excitement:
          all eyes fixed on the silent illuminated building whence the news would come.
          Across one window on the second floor was a large white patch, blank and
          sphinx-like. At right angles to one end of the block ran the High Street and the
          tall, blazing trams passed up and down and all eyes in the trams strained for a
          transient glimpse of the patch, hoping that it would flare out into message. </p>
        <p>Presently a man was seen to dash from the interior of the hall into the lobby,
          casting words at the waiting figures, who clamoured eagerly and disappeared
          within, just as the man broke through the folding doors and appeared at the top
          of the steps beneath the portico. The great crowd surged and groaned, and the
          word was quickly passed from rank to rank. </p>
        <p>"Savelli. Thirteen hundred and seventy majority." And then there burst out wild
          cheers and the crowd broke into a myriad little waves like a choppy sea. Men
          danced and shouted and clapped each other on the back, and the tall
          fa&#x00E7;ade of the street opposite the hall was a-flutter. Suddenly the
          white patch leaped into an illumination proclaiming the figures. </p>
        <p>Savelli&mdash;6,135. </p>
        <p>Finn&mdash;4,765. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0325" n="302"/>
        </p>
        <p>Again the wild cheering rose, and then the great double windows in the centre
          of the first floor of the Town Hall were flung open and Paul, surrounded by the
          mayor and officials, appeared. </p>
        <p>Paul gripped the iron hand-rail and looked down upon the tumultuous scene, his
          ears deafened by the roar, his eyes dazed by the conflicting lights and the
          million swift reflections from moving faces and arms and hats and handkerchiefs.
          The man is not born who can receive unmoved a frenzied public ovation. A lump
          rose in his throat. After all, this delirium of joy was sincere. He stood for
          the moment the idol of the populace. For him this vast concourse of human beings
          had waited in rain and mud and now became a deafening, seething welter of human
          passion. He gripped the rail tighter and closed his eyes. He heard as in a dream
          the voice of the mayor behind him: "Say a few words. They won't hear
          you&mdash;but that doesn't matter." </p>
        <p>Then Paul drew himself up, facing the whirling scene. He sought in his pockets
          and suddenly shot up his hand, holding a letter, and awaited a lull in the
          uproar. He was master of himself now. He had indeed words to say, deliberately
          prepared, and he knew that if he could get a hearing he would say them as
          deliberately. At last came comparative calm. </p>
        <p>"Gentlemen," said he, with a motion of the letter, "my opponent is dying." </p>
        <p>He paused. The words, so unexpected, so strangely different from the usual
          exordium, seemed to pass from line to line through the crowd. </p>
        <p>"I am speaking in the presence of death," said Paul, and paused again. </p>
        <p>And a hush spread like a long wave across the street, and the thronged windows,
          last of all, grew still and silent. <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0326" n="303"/>
        </p>
        <p>"I will ask you to hear me out, for I have something very grave to say." And
          his voice rang loud and clear. "Last night my opponent was forced to admit that
          nearly thirty years ago he suffered a term of penal servitude. The shock, after
          years of reparation, of spotless life, spent in the service of God and his
          fellow-creatures, has killed him. I desire publicly to proclaim that I, as his
          opponent, had no share in the dastardly blow that has struck him down. And I
          desire to proclaim the reason. He is my own father; I, Paul Savelli, am my
          opponent, Silas Finn's son." </p>
        <p>A great gasp and murmur rose from the wonder-stricken throng, but only
          momentarily, for the spell of drama was on them. Paul continued. </p>
        <p>"I will make public later on the reasons for our respective changes of name.
          For the present it is enough to state the fact of our relationship and of our
          mutual affection and respect. That I thank you for electing me goes without
          saying; and I will do everything in my power to advance the great cause you have
          enabled me to represent. I regret I cannot address you in another place
          to-night, as I had intended. I must ask you of your kindness to let me go
          quietly where my duty and my heart call me to my father's death-bed." </p>
        <p>He bowed and waved a dignified gesture of farewell, and turning into the hall
          met the assemblage of long, astounded faces. From outside came the dull rumbling
          of the dispersing crowd. The mayor, the first to break the silence, murmured a
          platitude. </p>
        <p>Paul thanked him gravely. Then he went to Wilson. "Forgive me," said he, "for
          all that has been amiss with me to-day. It has been a strain of a very peculiar
          kind." </p>
        <p>"I can well imagine it," said Wilson. </p>
        <p>"You see I'm not an aristocrat, after all," said Paul. </p>
        <p>Wilson looked the young man in the face and saw <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0327" n="304"/> the steel beneath the dark eyes, and
          the Proud setting of the lips. With a sudden impulse he wrung his hand. "I don't
          care a damn!" said he. "You are." </p>
        <p>Paul said, unsmiling: "I can face the music. That's all." He drew a note from
          his pocket. "Will you do me a final service? Go round to the Conservative Club
          at once, and tell the meeting what has happened, and give this to Colonel
          Winwood." </p>
        <p>"With pleasure," said Wilson. </p>
        <p>Then Paul shook hands with all his fellow-workers and thanked them in his
          courtly way, and, pleading for solitude, went through the door of the great
          chamber and, guided by an attendant, reached the exit in a side street where his
          car awaited him. A large concourse of people stood drawn up in line on each side
          of the street, marshalled by policemen. A familiar crooked figure limped from
          the shadow of the door, holding a hard felt hat, his white poll gleaming in the
          shaft of light. "God bless you, sonny," he said in a hoarse whisper. </p>
        <p>Paul took the old man by the arm and drew him across the pavement to the car.
          "Get in," said he. </p>
        <p>Barney Bill hung back. "No, sonny; no." </p>
        <p>"It's not the first time we've driven together. Get in. I want you." </p>
        <p>So Barney Bill allowed himself to be thrust into the luxurious car, and Paul
          followed. And perhaps for the first time in the history of great elections the
          successful candidate drove away from the place where the poll was declared in
          dead silence, attended only by the humblest of his constituents. But every man
          in the throng bared his head.</p>

        <p>HE had the stroke in the night," said Barney Bill suddenly. </p>
        <p>Paul turned sharply on him. "Why wasn't I told?" </p>
        <p>"Could you have cured him?" </p>
        <p>"Of course not." </p>
        <p>"Could you have done him any good?" </p>
        <p>"I ought to have been told." </p>
        <p>"You had enough of worries before you for one day, sonny." </p>
        <p>"That was my business," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Jane and I, being as it were responsible parties, took the liberty, so to
          speak, of thinking it our business too." </p>
        <p>Paul drummed impatiently on his knees. </p>
        <p>"Yer ain't angry, are you, sonny?" the old man asked plaintively. </p>
        <p>"No&mdash;not angry&mdash;with you and jane&mdash;certainly not. I
          know you acted for the best, out of love for me. But you shouldn't have deceived
          me. I thought it was a mere nervous breakdown&mdash;the strain and shock.
          You never said a word about it, and Jane, when I talked to her this morning,
          never gave me to dream there was anything serious amiss. So I say you two have
          deceived me." </p>
        <p>"But I'm a telling of yer, sonny&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"Yes, yes, I know. I don't reproach you. But don't you see? I'm sick of lies.
          Dead sick. I've been up <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0329" n="306"/> to my neck in
          a bog of falsehood ever since I was a child and I'm making a hell of a struggle
          to get on to solid ground. The Truth for me now. By God! nothing but the Truth!" </p>
        <p>Barney Bill, sitting for-ward, hunched up, on the seat of the car, just as he
          used to sit on the footboard of his van, twisted his head round. "I'm not an
          eddicated person," said he, "although if I hadn't done a bit of reading in my
          time I'd have gone dotty all by my lones in the old 'bus, but I've come to one
          or two conclusions in my, so to speak, variegated career, and one is that if you
          go one in that 'ere mad way for Truth in Parliament, you'll be a bull in a china
          shop, and they'll get sticks and dawgs to hustle you out. Sir Robert Peel, old
          Gladstone, Dizzy, the whole lot of the old Yuns was up against it. They had to
          compromise. It's compromise"&mdash;the old man dwelt lovingly, as usual, on
          the literary word&mdash;"it's compromise you must have in Parliament." </p>
        <p>"I'll see Parliament damned first!" cried Paul, his nerves on edge. </p>
        <p>"You'll have to wait a long time, sonny," said Barney Bill, wagging a sage
          head. "Parliament takes a lot of damning." </p>
        <p>"Anyhow," said Paul, not eager to continue the argument, but unconsciously
          caught in the drift of Barney Bill's philosophy, "my private life isn't
          politics, and there's not going to be another lie in my private life as long as
          I live." </p>
        <p>The old man broke a short silence with a dry chuckle. "How it takes one back!"
          he said reflectively. "Lor lumme! I can hear yer speaking now&mdash;just in
          the same tone&mdash;the night what yer run away with me. Yer hadn't a seat
          to yer breeches then, and now you've a seat in Parliament." He chuckled again at
          his joke. "But"&mdash;he gripped the young man's knee in his bony <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0330" n="307"/> clasp&mdash;"you're just the same
          Paul, sonny, God bless yer&mdash;and you'll come out straight all right.
          Here we are." </p>
        <p>The car drew up before Silas Finn's house. They entered. Jane, summoned, came
          down at once and met them in the dreadful dining-room, where a simple meal was
          spread. </p>
        <p>"I haven't heard&mdash;" she said. </p>
        <p>"I'm in." </p>
        <p>"I'm glad." </p>
        <p>"My father&mdash;?" he asked curtly. </p>
        <p>She looked at him wide-eyed for a second or two as he stood, his fur-lined coat
          with astrachan collar thrown open, his hand holding a soft felt hat on his hip,
          his absurdly beautiful head thrown back, to casual glance the Fortunate Youth of
          a month or two ago. But to Jane's jealous eye he was not even the man she had
          seen that afternoon. He looked many years older. She confessed afterwards to
          surprise at not finding his hair grey at the temples, thus manifesting her
          ordered sense of the harmonious. She confessed, too, that she was
          frightened&mdash;jane who, for any other reason than the mere saving of her
          own skin, would have stolidly faced Hyrcanean tigers&mdash;at the stern eyes
          beneath the contracted brows. He was a different Paul altogether. And here we
          have the divergence between the masculine and the feminine point of view. Jane
          saw a new avatar; Barney Bill the ragged urchin of the Bludston brick-fields.
          She shifted her glance to the old man. He, standing crookedly, cocked his head
          and nodded. </p>
        <p>"He knows all about it." </p>
        <p>"Yes, yes," said Paul. "How is my father?" </p>
        <p>Jane threw out her hands in the Englishwoman's insignificant gesture. "He's
          unconscious&mdash;has been for hours&mdash;the nurse is up with
          him&mdash;the end may come <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0331" n="308"/> any
          moment. I hid it from you till the last for your own sake. Would you care to go
          upstairs?" </p>
        <p>She moved to the door. Paul threw off his overcoat and, followed by Barney
          Bill, accompanied her. On the landing they were met by the nurse. </p>
        <p>"It is all over," she said. </p>
        <p>"I will go in for a moment," said Paul. "I should like to be alone." </p>
        <p>In a room hung like the rest of the house with gaudy pictures he stood for a
          short while looking at the marble face of the strange-souled, passionate being
          that had been his father. The lids had closed for ever over the burning,
          sorrowful eyes; the mobile lips were for ever mute. In his close sympathy with
          the man Paul knew what had struck him down. It was not the blow of the nameless
          enemy, but the stunning realization that he was not, after all, the irresistible
          nominee of the Almighty. His great faith had not suffered; for the rigid face
          was serene, as though he had accepted this final chastisement and purification
          before entrance into the Eternal Kingdom; but his high pride, the mainspring of
          his fanatical life, had been broken and the workings of the physical organism
          had been arrested. In those few moments of intense feeling, in the presence of
          death, it was given to Paul to tread across the threshold of the mystery of his
          birth. Here lay stiff and cold no base clay such as that of which Polly
          Kegworthy had been formed. It had been the tenement of a spirit beautiful and
          swift. No matter to what things he himself had been born&mdash;he had put
          that foolishness behind him&mdash;at all events his dream bad come partly
          true. His father had been one of the great ones, one of the conquerors, one of
          the high princes of men. Multitudes of kings had not been so parented. Outwardly
          a successful business man and a fanatical Dissenter&mdash;there were
          thousands like Silas <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0332" n="309"/> Finn. But Paul
          knew his inner greatness, the terrific struggle of his soul, the warrings
          between fierce blood and iron will, the fervent purpose, the lofty aspirations
          and the unwavering conduct of his life of charity and sorrow. He stretched out
          his hand and with his finger tips lightly touched the dead man's forehead. "I'm
          proud to be your son, he murmured. </p>
        <p>Then the nurse came in and Paul went downstairs. Barney Bill waylaid him in the
          hall, and led him into the dining-room. "Have a little food and drink, sonny.
          You look as if yer need it&mdash;especially drink. 'Ere." He seized a
          decanter of whisky&mdash;since Paul's first visit, Silas had always kept it
          in the house for his son's, comforting&mdash;and would have filled the
          tumbler had not Paul restrained him. He squirted in the soda. "Drink it down and
          you'll feel better." </p>
        <p>Paul swallowed a great gulp. "Yes," he agreed. "There are times when it does
          help a man." </p>
        <p>"Liquor is like a dawg," said Bill. "Keep it in subjection, so to speak, and
          it's yer faithful friend." </p>
        <p>"Where's Jane?" Paul asked. </p>
        <p>"She's busy. Half the borough seem to be calling, or telephoning"&mdash;and
          even at that moment Paul could hear the maid tripping across the hall and
          opening the front door&mdash;"I've told her what occurred. She seemed half
          skeered. She's had a dreadful day, pore gal." </p>
        <p>"She has indeed," said Paul. </p>
        <p>He threw himself into a chair, dead beat, at the end of emotional strain, and
          remained talking with the old man of he scarce knew what. But these
          two&mdash;jane and the old man&mdash;were linked to him by imperishable
          ties, and he could not leave them yet awhile in the house of death. Barney Bill
          stirred the fire, which blazed up, making the perky animals on the hearth cast
          faint and fantastic shadows. </p>
        <p>"It's funny how he loved those darned little beasts, <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0333" n="310"/> isn't it now? I remember of him telling
          me as how they transported him into magic something&mdash;or the
          other&mdash;medi&mdash;he had a word for it&mdash;I
          dunno&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"Mediaeval?" </p>
        <p>"That's it, sonny. Mediaeval forests. It means back of old times, don't it?
          King Arthur and his Round Table&mdash;I done a bit of reading, yer know."
          The old man took out pouch and pipe. "That's what drew us together, sonny, our
          taste for literature. Remember?" </p>
        <p>"Can I ever forget?" said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Well, he was like that too. He had lots of po'try in him&mdash;not the
          stuff that rhymes, yer know, like 'The Psalm of Life' and so forth, but real
          po'try. I wish I could tell yer what I mean&mdash; &mdash;" His face was
          puckered into a thousand wrinkles with the intellectual effort, and his little
          diamond eyes gleamed. "He could take a trumpery common thing like that there
          mug-faced, lop-eared hare and make it stand for the
          medi-what-you-call-it-forest. I've said to him, 'Come out with me on the old
          'bus if you want green and loneliness and nature.' And he has said&mdash;I
          recollect one talk in particular&mdash;he said, 'I'd love to hear' something
          about a pipe&mdash;I'm getting old, sonny&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"The Pipes of Pan?" Paul suggested. </p>
        <p>"The very words. Lor lumme! how did you guess it?" He paused, his fingers
          holding the lighted match, which went out before he could apply it to his
          tobacco. "Yus. 'The Pipes of Pan.' I don't know what it means. Anyway, he said
          he'd love to hear them in the real forest, but duty kept him to bricks and
          mortar and so he had to hear them in imagination. He said that all them footling
          little beasts were a-listening to 'em, and they told him all about it. I
          remember he told me more about the woods than I know myself&mdash;and I
          reckon I could teach his business to any gamekeeper or poacher in England. I
          don't say as how <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0334" n="311"/> he knew the
          difference between a stoat and a weasel&mdash;he didn't. A cock-pheasant and
          a hen-partridge would have been the same to him. But the spirit of
          it&mdash;the meaning of it&mdash;he fair raised my hair off&mdash;he
          knew it a darned sight better nor I. And that's what I set out for to say,
          sonny. He had po'try in him. And all this"&mdash;he swept an all-inclusive
          hand&mdash;"all this meant to him something that you and I can't tumble to,
          sonny. It meant something different to what it looked like&mdash;ah!" and
          impatient at his impotence to express philosophic thought, he cast another
          lighted match angrily into the fire. </p>
        <p>Paul, high product of modern culture, sat in wonder at the common old fellow's
          clarity of vision. Tears rolled down his cheek. "I know, dear old Bill, what
          you're trying to say. Only one man has ever been able to say it. A mad poet
          called Blake.</p>

        <lg type="verse">
          <l>'To see a world in a grain of sand,</l>
          <l>And a heaven in a wild flower;</l>
          <l>Hold infinity in the palm of your hand, And eternity in an hour'."</l>
        </lg>

        <p>Barney Bill started forward in his chair and clapped his hand on the young
          man's knee. "By gum! you've got it. That's what I was a-driving at. That's
          Silas. I call to mind when he was a boy&mdash;pretty dirty and ragged he was
          too&mdash;as he used to lean over the parapet of Blackfriars Bridge and
          watch the current sort of swirling round the piers, and he used to say as how he
          could hear what the river was saying. I used to think him loony. But it was
          po'try, sonny, all the time." </p>
        <p>The old man, thus started on reminiscence, continued, somewhat garrulous, and
          Paul, sunk in the armchair by the fire, listened indulgently, waiting for Jane.
          She, meanwhile, was occupied upstairs and in the library <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0335" n="312"/> answering telephone messages and
          sending word out to callers by the maid. For, on the heels of Paul, as Barney
          Bill had said, many had come on errand of inquiry and condolence and all the
          news agencies and newspapers of London seemed to be on the telephone. Some of
          the latter tried for speech with the newlyelected candidate whom they understood
          to be in the house, but Jane denied them firmly. She had had some training as a
          politician's private secretary. At last the clanging bell ceased ringing, and
          the maid ceased running to and from the street door, and the doctor had come and
          given his certificate and gone, and Jane joined the pair in the dining-room. She
          brought in from the hall a tray of visiting cards and set it on the table. "I
          suppose it was kind of them all to come," she said. </p>
        <p>She sat down listlessly in a straight-backed chair, and then, at a momentary
          end of her fine strength suddenly broke into tears and sobs and buried her head
          on her arms. Paul rose, bent over her and clasped her shoulders comfortingly.
          Presently she turned and blindly sought his embrace. He raised her to her feet,
          and they stood as they had done years ago, when, boy and girl, they had come to
          the parting of their ways. She cried silently for a while, and then she said
          miserably: "I've only you left, dear." </p>
        <p>In this hour of spent effort and lassitude it was a queer physical comfort,
          very pure and sweet, to feel the close contact of her young, strong body. She,
          too, out of the wreck, was all that he had left. His clasp tightened, and he
          murmured soothing words. </p>
        <p>"Oh, my dear, I am so tired," she said, giving herself up, for her part also,
          to the foolish solace of his arms. "I wish I could stay here always, Paul." </p>
        <p>He whispered: "Why not?" </p>
        <p>Indeed, why not? Instinct spoke. His people were <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0336" n="313"/> her people and her people his. And she
          had proved herself a brave, true woman. Before him no longer gleamed the
          will-o'-the-wisp leading him a fantastic dance through life. Before him lay only
          darkness. Jane and he, hand in hand, could walk through it fearless and
          undismayed. And her own great love, shown unashamed in the abandonment of this
          moment of intense emotion' made his pulses throb. He whispered again: "Why not?" </p>
        <p>For answer she nestled closer. "if only you could love me a little, little
          bit?" </p>
        <p>"But I do," said Paul hoarsely. </p>
        <p>She shook her head and sobbed afresh, and they stood in close embrace at the
          end of the room by the door, regardless of the presence of the old man who sat,
          his back to them, smoking his pipe and looking, with his birdlike crook of the
          neck, meditatively into the fire. "No, no," said Jane, at last. "It's silly of
          me. Forgive me. We mustn't talk of such things. Neither of us is fit
          to&mdash;and to-night it's not becoming. I have lost my father and you are
          only my brother, Paul dear." </p>
        <p>Barney Bill broke in suddenly; and at the sound of his voice they moved apart.
          "Think over it, sonny. Don't go and do anything rash." </p>
        <p>"Don't you think it would be wise for Jane to marry me?" </p>
        <p>"Ay&mdash;for Jane." </p>
        <p>"Not for me?" </p>
        <p>"It's only wise for a man to marry a woman what he loves," said Barney Bill. </p>
        <p>"Well ?" </p>
        <p>"You said, when we was a-driving here, as you are going to live for the Truth
          and nothing but the Truth. I only mention it," added the old man drily. </p>
        <p>Jane recovered herself, with a gulp in the throat, <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0337" n="314"/> and before Paul could answer said: "We
          too had a talk to-day, Paul. Remember," her voice quavered a
          little&mdash;"about carrots." </p>
        <p>"You were right in essence," said Paul, looking at her gravely. "But I should
          have my incentive. I know my own mind. My affection for you is of the deepest.
          That is Truth&mdash;I needn't tell you. We could lead a happy and noble life
          together." </p>
        <p>"We belong to two different social classes, Paul," she said gently, again
          sitting in the straight-backed chair by the table. </p>
        <p>"We don't," he replied. "I repudiated my claims to the other class this
          evening. I was admitted into what is called high society, partly because people
          took it for granted that I was a man of good birth. Now that I've publicly
          proclaimed that I'm not&mdash;and the newspapers will pretty soon find out
          all about me now&mdash;I'll drop out of that same high society. I shan't
          seek readmittance." </p>
        <p>"People will seek you." </p>
        <p>"You don't know the world," said he. </p>
        <p>"It must be mean and horrid." </p>
        <p>"Oh, no. It's very just and honourable. I shan't blame it a bit for not wanting
          me. Why should I? I don't belong to it." </p>
        <p>"But you do, dear Paul," she cried earnestly. "Even if you could get rid of
          your training and mode of thought, you can't get rid of your essential self.
          You've always been an aristocrat, and I've always been a small shop-keeper's
          daughter and shall continue to be one." </p>
        <p>"And I say," Paul retorted, "that we've both sprung from the people, and are of
          the people. You've raised yourself above the small shop-keeping class just as
          much as I have. Don't let us have any sham humility about it. Whatever happens
          you'll always associate <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0338" n="315"/> with folk of
          good-breeding and education. You couldn't go back to Barn Street. It would be
          idiotic for me to contemplate such a thing for my part. But between Barn Street
          and Mayfair there's a refined and intellectual land where you and I can meet on
          equal ground and make our social position. What do you say?" </p>
        <p>She did not look at him, but fingered idly the cards on the tray. "To-morrow
          you will think differently. To-night you're all on the strain." </p>
        <p>"And, axing yer pardon, sonny, for chipping in," said the old man, holding up
          his pipe in his gnarled fingers, "you haven't told her as how you loves
          her&mdash;not as how a young woman axed in marriage ought to be told." </p>
        <p>"I've spoken the Truth, dear old friend," said Paul. "I've. got down to
          bed-rock to-night. I have a deep and loyal affection for Jane. I shan't waver in
          it all my life long. I'll soon find my carrot, as she calls it&mdash;it will
          be England's greatness. She is the woman that will help me on my path. I've
          finished with illusions for ever and ever. Jane is the bravest and grandest of
          realities. To-night's work has taught me that. For me, Jane stands for the
          Truth. Jane&mdash;" </p>
        <p>He turned to her, but she had risen from her chair, staring at a card which she
          held in her hand. Her clear eyes met his for an instant as she threw the card on
          the table before him. "No, dear. For you, that's the Truth." </p>
        <p>He took it up and looked at it stupidly. It bore a crown and the inscription:
          "The Princess Sophie Zobraska," and a pencilled line, in her handwriting: <hi
            rend="italic">"With anxious inquiries."</hi> He reeled, as if someone had
          dealt him a heavy blow on the head. He recovered to see Jane regarding him with
          her serene gravity. "Did you know about this?" he asked dully. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0339" n="316"/>
        </p>
        <p>"No. I've just seen the card. I found it at the bottom of the pile." </p>
        <p>"How did it come?" </p>
        <p>Jane rang the bell. "I don't know. If Annie's still up, we can find out. As it
          was at the bottom, it must have been one of the first." </p>
        <p>"How could the news have travelled so fast?" said Paul. </p>
        <p>The maid came in. Questioned, she said that just after Paul had gone upstairs,
          and while Jane was at the telephone, a chauffeur had presented the card. He
          belonged to a great lighted limousine in which sat a lady in hat and dark veil.
          According to her orders, she had said that Mr. Finn was dead, and the chauffeur
          had gone away and she had shut the door. </p>
        <p>The maid was dismissed. Paul stood on the hearthrug with bent brows, his hands
          in his jacket pockets. "I can't understand it," he said. </p>
        <p>"She must ha' come straight from the Town Hall," said Barney Bill. </p>
        <p>"But she wasn't there," cried Paul. </p>
        <p>"Sonny," said the old fellow, "if you're always dead sure of where a woman is
          and where a woman isn't, you're a wiser man than Solomon with all his wives and
          other domestic afflictions." </p>
        <p>Paul threw the card into the fire. "It doesn't matter where she was," said he.
          "It was a very polite&mdash;even a gracious act to send in her card on her
          way home. But it makes no difference to what I was talking about. What have I
          got to do with princesses? They're out of my sphere. So are Naiads and Dryads
          and Houris and Valkyrie and other fabulous ladies. The Princess Zobraska has
          nothing to do with the question." </p>
        <p>He made a step towards Jane and, his hand on her shoulder, looked at her in his
          new, masterful way. "I come in the most solemn hour and in the crisis of my <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0340" n="317"/> life to ask you to marry me. My father,
          whom I've only learned to love and revere to-night, is lying dead upstairs.
          To-night I have cut away all bridges behind me. I go into the unknown. We'll
          have to fight, but we'll fight together. You have courage, and I at least have
          that. There's a seat in Parliament which I'll have to fight for afterwards like
          a dog for a bone, and an official position which brings in enough bread
          and-butter&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"And there's a fortune remarked Barney Bill. </p>
        <p>"What do you mean?" Paul swung round sharply. </p>
        <p>"Yer father's fortune, sonny. Who do yer suppose he was a-going to leave it to?
          'Omes for lost 'orses or Free Zionists? I don't know as 'ow I oughter talk of it
          ' him not buried yet&mdash;but I seed his will when he made it a month or
          two ago, and barring certair legacies to Free Zionists and such-like lunatic
          folk, not to speak of Jane ere being left comfortably off, you're the residuary
          legatee, sonny&mdash;with something like a hundred thousand pounds. There's
          no talk of earning bread-and-butter, sonny." </p>
        <p>"It never entered my head," said Paul, rather dazed. "I suppose a father would
          leave his money to his son. I didn't realize it." He passed his hand over his
          eyes. "So many things have happened to-night. Anyhow," he said, smiling queerly,
          in his effort to still a whirling brain, "if there are no anxieties as to ways
          and means, so much the better for Jane and me. I am all the more justified in
          asking you to marry me. Will you?" </p>
        <p>"Before I answer you, Paul dear," she replied steadily, "you must answer me.
          I've known about the will, just like Bill, all the time&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"She has that," confirmed the old man. </p>
        <p>"So this isn't news to me, dear, and can't alter anything from me to you." <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0341" n="318"/>
        </p>
        <p>"Why should it?" asked Paul. "But it makes my claim a little stronger." </p>
        <p>"Oh, no," she replied, shaking her head. "It only&mdash;only confuses
          issues. Money has nothing to do with what I'm going to ask you. You said
          to-night you were going to live for the Truth&mdash;the real naked Truth.
          Now, Paul dear, I want the real, naked Truth. Do you love that woman?" </p>
        <p>At her question she seemed to have grown from the common sense, clear-eyed Jane
          into a great and commanding presence. She had drawn herself to her full height.
          Her chin was in the air, her generous bust thrown forward, her figure imperious,
          her eyes intense. And Paul too drew himself up and looked at her in his new
          manhood. And they stood thus for a while, beloved enemies. </p>
        <p>"If you want the Truth&mdash;yes, I do love her," said he. </p>
        <p>" Then how dare you ask me to be your wife?" </p>
        <p>"Because the one is nonsensical and illusory and the other is real and
          practical." </p>
        <p>She flashed out angrily: "Do you suppose I can live my woman's life on the real
          and practical? What kind of woman do you take me for? An Amelia, a Patient
          Griselda, a tabby cat?" </p>
        <p>Paul said: "You know very well; I take you for one of the greatest-hearted of
          women. I've already said it to-night." </p>
        <p>"Do you think I'm a greater-hearted woman than she? Wait, I've not finished,"
          she cried in a loud voice. "Your Princess&mdash;you cut her heart into bits
          the other day, when you proclaimed yourself a low-born impostor. She thought you
          a high-born gentleman, and you told her of the gutter up north and the
          fried-fish shop and the Sicilian organ-grinding woman. She,
          royalty&mdash;you of the scum! She left you. This morn- <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0342" n="319"/> ing she learned worse. She learned that
          you were the son of a convict. What does she do? She comes somehow&mdash;I
          don't know how&mdash;to Hickney Heath and hears you publicly give yourself
          away&mdash;and she drives straight here with a message for you. It's for
          you, the message. Who else?" She stood before Paul, a flashing Jane unknown.
          "Would a woman who didn't love you come to this house to-night? She wouldn't,
          Paul. You know it! Dear old Bill here, who hasn't moved in royal circles, knows
          it. No, my dear man," she said regally, "I've given you all my
          love&mdash;everything that is in me&mdash;since I was a child of
          thirteen. You will always have it. It's my great joy that you'll always have it.
          But, by God, Paul, I'm not going to exchange it for anything less. Can you give
          me the same?" </p>
        <p>"You know I can't," said Paul. "But I can give you that which would make our
          marriage a happy one. I believe the experience of the world has shown it to be
          the securest basis." </p>
        <p>She was on the point of breaking out, but turned away, with clenched hands,
          and, controlling herself, faced him again. "You're an honourable and loyal man,
          Paul, and you're saying this to save your face. I know that you would marry me.
          I know that you would be faithful to me in thought and word and act. I know that
          you would be good and kind and never give me a moment's cause for complaint. But
          your heart would be with the other woman. Whether she's out of your sphere or
          not&mdash;what does it matter to me? You love her and she loves you. I know
          it. I should always know it. You'd be living in hell and so should I. I should
          prefer to remain in purgatory, which, after all, is quite bearable&mdash;I'm
          used to it&mdash;and I love you enough to wish to see you in paradise." </p>
        <p>She turned away with a wide gesture and an upward <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0343" n="320"/> inflexion of her voice. Barney Bill
          refilled his pipe and fixed Paul with his twinkling diamond eyes. "It's a pity,
          sonny&mdash;a dodgasted pity!" </p>
        <p>"We're up against the Truth, old man, the unashamed and naked truth," said
          Paul, with a sigh. </p>
        <p>Jane caught Paul's fur-lined coat and hat from the chair on which he had thrown
          it and came to him. "It's time for you to go and rest, dear. We're all of us
          exhausted." </p>
        <p>She helped him on with the heavy coat, and for farewell put both her hands on
          his shoulders. "You must forget a lot of things I've said to-night." </p>
        <p>"I can't help remembering them." </p>
        <p>"No, dear. Forget them." She drew his face down and kissed him on the lips.
          Then she led him out to the front door and accompanied him down the steps to the
          kerb where the car with its weary chauffeur was waiting. The night had cleared
          and the stars shone bright in the sky. She pointed to one, haphazard. "Your
          star, Paul. Believe in it still." </p>
        <p>He drove off. She entered the house, and, flinging herself on the floor by
          Barney Bill, buried her head on the old man's knees and sobbed her brave heart
          out.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXII</head>

        <p>THE next morning amazement fluttered over a million breakfast tables and
          throbbed in a million railway carriages. For all the fierceness of political
          passions, parliamentary elections are but sombre occurrences to the general
          public. Rarely are they attended by the picturesque, the dramatic, the tragic.
          But already the dramatic had touched the election of Hickney Heath, stimulating
          interest in the result. Thousands, usually apathetic as to political matters,
          opened their newspapers to see how the ex-convict candidate had fared. They
          read, with a gasp, that he was dead; that his successful opponent had proclaimed
          himself to be his son. They had the dramatic value of cumulative effect. If Paul
          had ever sought notoriety he had it now. His name rang through the length and
          breadth of the land. The early editions of the London afternoon papers swelled
          the chorus of amazed comment and conjecture. Some had even routed out a fact or
          two, Heaven knows whence, concerning father and son. According to party they
          meted out praise or blame. Some, unversed in the law, declared the election
          invalid. The point was discussed in a hundred clubs. </p>
        <p>There was consternation in the social world. The Duchesses' boudoirs with which
          Paul had been taunted hummed with indignation. They had entertained an
          adventurer unawares. They had entrusted the sacred <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0345" n="322"/> ark of their political hopes to a
          charlatan. Their daughters had danced with the offspring of gaol and gutter. He
          must be cast out from the midst of them. So did those that were foolish
          furiously rage together and imagine many a vain thing. The Winwoods came in for
          pity. They had been villainously imposed upon. And the Young England League to
          which they had all subscribed so handsomely&mdash;where were its funds? Was
          it safe to leave them at the disposal of so unprincipled a fellow? Then germs of
          stories crept in from the studios and the stage and grew perversely in the
          overheated atmosphere. Paul's reputation began to assume a pretty colour. On the
          other hand, there were those who, while deploring the deception, were impressed
          by the tragedy and by Paul's attitude. He had his defenders. Among the latter
          first sprang forward Lord Francis Ayres, the Chief Whip, officially bound to
          protect his own pet candidate. </p>
        <p>He called early at the house in Portland Place, a distressed and anxious man.
          The door was besieged by reporters from newspapers, vainly trying to gain,
          entrance. His arrival created a sensation. At any Tate there was a headline
          "Opposition Whip calls on Savelli." One or two attempted to interview him on the
          doorstep. He excused himself courteously. As -yet he knew as much or as little
          as they. The door opened. The butler snatched him in hurriedly. He asked to see
          the Winwoods. He found them in the library. </p>
        <p>"Here's an awful mess," said he, throwing up his hands. "I thought I'd have a
          word or two with you before I tackle Savelli. Have you seen him this morning?" </p>
        <p>"Oh, yes." </p>
        <p>"Well, what do you think about it?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0346" n="323"/>
        </p>
        <p>"I think," said Ursula, "that the best thing I can do is to take him away with
          me for a rest as soon as possible. He's at the end of his tether." </p>
        <p>"You seem to take it pretty calmly." </p>
        <p>"How do you expect us to take it, my dear Frank?" she asked. "We always
          expected Paul to do the right thing when the time came, and we consider that he
          has done it." </p>
        <p>The Chief Whip smoothed a perplexed brow. "I don't quite follow. Were you,
          vulgarly speaking, in the know all the time?" </p>
        <p>"Sit down, and I'll tell you." </p>
        <p>So he sat down and Miss Winwood quietly told him all she knew about Paul and
          what had happened during the past few weeks, while the Colonel sat by his desk
          and tugged his long moustache and here and there supplemented her narrative. </p>
        <p>"That's all very interesting," Ayres remarked when she had finished, "and you
          two have acted like bricks. I also see that he must have had a devil of a time
          of it. But I've got to look at things from an official point of view." </p>
        <p>"There's no question of invalidity, is there?" asked Colonel Winwood. </p>
        <p>"No. He was known as Paul Savelli, nominated as Paul Savelli, and elected as
          Paul Savelli by the electors of Hickney Heath. So he'll sit as Paul Savelli.
          That's all right. But how is the House going to receive him when he is
          introduced? How will it take him afterwards? What use will he be to the party?
          We only ran him because he seemed to be the most brilliant of the young
          outsiders. We hoped great things of him. Hasn't he smashed up himself socially?
          Hasn't he smashed up his career at the very beginning? All that is what I want
          to know." <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0347" n="324"/>
        </p>
        <p>"So do I," groaned Colonel Winwood. "I didn't have a wink of sleep last night." </p>
        <p>"I didn't either," said Ursula, "but I don't think it will matter a row of pins
          to Paul in his career." </p>
        <p>"It will always be up against him," said Ayres. </p>
        <p>"Because he has acted like a man?" </p>
        <p>"It's the touch of Ruy Blas that I'm afraid of." </p>
        <p>"You must remember that he wasn't aware of his relation to the dead man until
          the eve of the election." </p>
        <p>"But he was aware that he wasn't a descendant of a historical Italian family,
          which everyone thought him to be. I don't speak for myself," said Ayres. "I'm
          fond of the chap. One can't help it. He has the charm of the great gentleman,
          confound him, and it's all natural. The cloven hoof has never appeared, because
          I personally believe there's no cloven hoof. The beggar was born well bred, and,
          as to performance&mdash;well&mdash;he has been a young meteor across the
          political sky. Until this election. Then he was a disappointment. I frankly
          confess it. I didn't know what he was playing at. Now I do. Poor chap. I
          personally am sympathetic. But what about the cold-blooded other people, who
          don't know what you've told me? To them he's the son of an
          ex-convict&mdash;a vendor of fried fish&mdash;I put it brutally from
          their point of view&mdash;who has been masquerading as a young St. George on
          horseback. Will he ever be forgiven? Officially, have I any use for him? You
          see, I'm responsible to the party." </p>
        <p>"Any party," said Ursula, "would be a congregation of imbeciles who didn't do
          their best to develop the genius of Paul Savelli." </p>
        <p>"I'm fond of Paul," said Colonel Winwood, in his tired way, "but I don't know
          that I would go as far as that." <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0348" n="325"/>
        </p>
        <p>"It's only because you're a limited male, my dear James. I suppose Caesar was
          the only man who really crossed the Rubicon. And the fuss he made about it!
          Women jump across with the utmost certainty. My dear Frank, we're behind Paul,
          whatever happens. He has been fighting for his own hand ever since he was a
          child, it is true. But he has fought gallantly." </p>
        <p>"My dear Miss Winwood," said Frank Ayres, "if there's a man to be envied, it's
          the one who has you for his champion!" </p>
        <p>"Anyone, my dear Frank, is to be envied," she retorted, "who is championed by
          common-sense." </p>
        <p>"All these fireworks illuminate nothing," said Colonel Winwood. "I think we had
          better ask Paul to come down and see Frank. Would you like to see him alone?" </p>
        <p>"I had rather you stayed," said Frank Ayres. </p>
        <p>A message was sent to Paul, and presently he appeared, very pale and haggard. </p>
        <p>Frank Ayres met him with outstretched hand, spoke a courteous word of sympathy,
          apologized for coming in the hour of tragic bereavement. </p>
        <p>Paul thanked him with equal courtesy. "I was about to write to you, Lord
          Francis," he continued, "a sort of statement in explanation of what happened
          last night&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"Our friends have told me all, I think, that you may have to say." </p>
        <p>"I shall still write it," said Paul, "so that you can have it in black and
          white. At present, I've given the press nothing." </p>
        <p>"Quite right," said Frank Ayres. "For God's sake, let us work together as far
          as the press is concerned. That's one of the reasons why I've forced myself upon
          you. It's horrible, my dear fellow, to intrude <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0349"
            n="326"/> at such a time. I hate it, as you can well imagine. But it's my
          duty." </p>
        <p>"Of course it is," said Paul. There was a span of awkward silence. "Well," said
          he, with a wan smile, "we're facing, not a political, but a very unimportant
          party situation. Don't suppose I haven't a sense of proportion. I have. What for
          me is the end of the world is the unruffled continuance of the cosmic scheme for
          the rest of mankind. But there are relative things to consider. You have to
          consider the party. I'm sort of fly-blown. Am I any use? Let us talk straight.
          Am I or am I not?" </p>
        <p>"My dear chap," said Frank Ayres, with perplexed knitting of the brows, "I
          don't quite know what to say. You yourself have invited me to talk straight.
          Well! Forgive me if I do. There may be a suggestion in political quarters that
          you have won this election under false pretences." </p>
        <p>"Do you want me to resign my seat?" </p>
        <p>The two men looked deep into each other's eyes. </p>
        <p>"A Unionist in is a Liberal out," said Frank Ayres, "and counts two on
          division. That's one way of looking at it. We want all we can get from the
          enemy. On the other hand, you'd come in for a lot of criticism and hostility.
          You'd have to start not only from the beginning, but with a handicap. Are you
          strong enough to face it?" </p>
        <p>"I'm not going to run away from anything," said Paul. "But I'll tell you what
          I'm prepared to do. I'll resign and fight the constituency again, under my real
          name of Kegworthy, provided, of course, the local people are willing to adopt
          me&mdash;on the understanding, however, that the party support me, or, at
          least, don't put forward another candidate. I'm not going to turn berserk." </p>
        <p>"That's a sporting offer, at any rate. But, pardon <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0350" n="327"/> me&mdash;we're talking
          business&mdash;where is the money for another election to come from?" </p>
        <p>"My poor father's death makes me a wealthy man," replied Paul. </p>
        <p>Miss Winwood started forward in her chair. "My dear, you never told us." </p>
        <p>"There were so many other things to talk about this morning," he said gently;
          "but of course I would have told you later. I only mention it now"&mdash;he
          turned to the Chief Whip&mdash;"in answer to your direct and very pertinent
          question." </p>
        <p>Now between a political free-lance adopting a parliamentary career in order to
          fight for his own hand, as all Paul's supporters were frankly aware that he was
          doing, and a wealthy, independent and brilliant young politician lies a wide
          gulf. The last man on earth, in his private capacity, to find his estimate of
          his friends influenced by their personal possessions was the fine aristocrat
          Lord Francis Ayres. But he was a man of the world, the very responsible head of
          the executive of a great political party. As that executive head he was
          compelled to regard Paul from a different angle. The millions of South Africa or
          the Middle West might vainly knock at his own front door till the crack of doom,
          while Paul the penniless sauntered in an honoured guest. But in his official
          room in the House of Commons more stern and worldly considerations had to
          prevail. </p>
        <p>"Of course I can't give you an answer now," said he. "I'll have to discuss the
          whole matter with the powers that be. But a seat's a seat, and though I
          appreciate your Quixotic offer, I don't see why we should risk it. It's up to
          you to make good. It's more in your own interest that I'm speaking now. Can you
          go through with it?" </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0351" n="328"/>

        <p>Paul, with his unconquerable instinct for the dramatic, hauled out the little
          cornelian heart at the end of his watch-chain. "My dear fellow," said he. "Do
          you see that? It was given to me for failing to win a race at a Sunday-school
          treat, when I was a very little boy. I didn't possess coat or stockings, and my
          toes came out through the ends of my boots, and in order to keep the thing safe
          I knotted it up in the tail of my shirt, which waggled out of the seat of my
          breeches. It was given to me by a beautiful lady, who, I remember, smelled like
          all the perfumes of Araby. She awakened my &aelig;sthetic sense by the
          divine and intoxicating odour that emanated from her. Since then I have never
          met woman so&mdash;so like a scented garden of all the innocences. To me she
          was a goddess. I overheard her prophesy things about me. My life began from that
          moment. I kept the cornelian heart all my life, as a talisman. It has brought me
          through all kinds of things. Once I was going to throw it away and Miss Winwood
          would not let me. I kept it, somewhat against my will, for I thought it was a
          lying talisman. It had told me, in the sweets-cented lady's words, that I was
          the son of a prince. Give me half an hour to-morrow or the day after," he said,
          seeing a puzzled look in Frank Ayres's face, "and I'll tell you a true
          psychological fairy tale&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="la">apologia pro vita mea</foreign>
          </hi>. I say, anyhow, that lately, until last night, I thought this little
          cornelian heart was a lying talisman. Then I knew it didn't lie. I was the son
          of a prince, a prince of men, although he had been in gaol and spent his days
          afterwards in running emotional Christianity and fried-fish shops. His name was
          Silas. Mine is Paul. Something significant about it, isn't there?
          Anyhow"&mdash;he balanced the heart in the palm of his hand&mdash;"this
          hasn't lied. It has carried me through all my life. When I thought <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0352" n="329"/> it failed, I found it at the purest
          truth of its prophecy. It's not going to fail me now. If it's right for me to
          take my seat I'll take it&mdash;whether I make good politically, or not, is
          on the knees of the gods. But you may take it from me that there's nothing in
          this wide world that I won't face or go through with, if I've set my mind to
          it." </p>
        <p>So the child who had kicked Billy Goodge and taken the <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="it">spolia opima</foreign>
          </hi> of paper cocked hat and wooden sword spoke through the man. As then, in a
          queer way, he found himself commanding a situation; and as then, commanding it
          rightfully, through sheer personal force. Again, at a sign, he would have broken
          the sword across his knee. But the sign did not come. </p>
        <p>"Speaking quite unofficially," said Frank Ayres, "I think, if you feel like
          that, you would be a fool to give up your seat." </p>
        <p>"Very well," said Paul, "I thank you. And now, perhaps, it would be wise to
          draw up that statement for the press, if you can spare the time." </p>
        <p>So Paul made a draft and Frank Ayres revised it, and it was sent upstairs to be
          typed. When the typescript came down, Paul signed and dispatched it and gave the
          Chief Whip a duplicate. </p>
        <p>"Well," said the latter, shaking hands, "the best of good luck!" </p>
        <p>Whereupon he went home feeling that though there would be the deuce to pay,
          Paul Savelli would find himself perfectly solvent; and meeting the somewhat
          dubious Leader of the Opposition later in the day he said: "Anyhow, this 'far
          too gentlemanly party' has got someone picturesque, at last, to touch the
          popular imagination." </p>
        <p>"A new young Disraeli?" </p>
        <p>"Why not?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0353" n="330"/>
        </p>
        <p>The Leader made a faint gesture of philosophic doubt. "The mould is broken,"
          said he. </p>
        <p>"We'll see," said Frank Ayres, confidently. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Paul returned to his room and wrote a letter, three words of which
          he had put on paper&mdash;"My dear Princess"&mdash;when the summons to
          meet the Chief Whip had come. The unblotted ink had dried hard. He took another
          sheet. </p>
        <p>"My dear Princess," he began. </p>
        <p>He held his head in his hand. What could he say? Ordinary courtesy demanded an
          acknowledgment of the Princess's message of inquiry. But to write to her whom he
          had held close in his arms, whose lips had clung maddeningly to his, in terms of
          polite convention seemed impossible. What had she meant by her message? If she
          had gone scornfully out of his life, she had gone, and there was an end on't.
          Her coming back could bear only one interpretation&mdash;that of Jane's
          passionate statement. In spite of all, she loved him. But now, stripped and
          naked and at war with the world, for all his desire, he would have none of her
          love. Not he. . . . At last he wrote: </p>
        <p> PRINCESS,&mdash;A thousand grateful thanks for last night's gracious
          act&mdash;the act of the very great lady that I have the privilege of
          knowing you to be.<lb/> PAUL SAVELLI. </p>
        <p>He rang for a servant and ordered the note to be sent by hand, and then went
          out to Hickney Heath to see to the burying of his dead. On his return he found a
          familiar envelope with the crown on the flap awaiting him. It contained but few
          words: </p>
        <p> PAUL, come and see me. I will stay at home all day.<lb/> SOPHIE. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0354" n="331"/>
        </p>
        <p>His pulses throbbed. Her readiness to await his pleasure proved a humility of
          spirit rare in Princess Sophie Zobraska. Her hands were held out towards him.
          But he hardened his heart. The fairy-tale was over. Nothing but realities lay
          before him. The interview was perilous; but he was not one to shirk danger. He
          went out, took a cab and drove to Berkeley Square. </p>
        <p>She rose shyly as he entered and advanced to meet him. He kissed her hand, but
          when he sought to release it he found his held in her warm clasp. <hi
            rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">"Mon Dieu!</foreign>
          </hi> How ill you are looking!" she said, and her lips quivered. </p>
        <p>"I'm only tired." </p>
        <p>"You look so old. Ah!" She moved away from him with a sigh. "Sit down. I
          suppose you can guess why I've asked you to come," she continued after a pause.
          "But it is a little hard to say. I want you to forgive me." </p>
        <p>"There is nothing to forgive," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Don't be ungenerous; you know there is. I left you to bear everything alone." </p>
        <p>"You were more than justified. You found me an impostor. You were wounded in
          everything you held sacred. I wounded you deliberately. You could do nothing
          else but go away. Heaven forbid that I should have thought of blaming you. I
          didn't. I understood." </p>
        <p>"But it was I who did not understand," she said, looking at the rings on her
          fingers. "Yes. You are right. I was wounded&mdash;like an animal, I hid
          myself in the country, and I hoped you would write, which was foolish, for I
          knew you wouldn't. Then I felt that if I had loved you as I ought, I should
          never have gone away." </p>
        <p>"I thought it best to kill your love outright," said Paul. <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0355" n="332"/>
        </p>
        <p>She lay back on her cushions, very fair, very alluring, very sad. From where he
          sat he saw her face in its delicate profile, and he had a mighty temptation to
          throw himself on his knees by her side. </p>
        <p>"I thought, too, you had killed it," she said. </p>
        <p>"Still think so," said Paul, in a low voice. </p>
        <p>She raised herself, bent forward, and he met the blue depths of her gaze. "And
          you? Your love?" </p>
        <p>"I never did anything to kill it." </p>
        <p>"But I did." </p>
        <p>"No, you couldn't. I shall love you to the hour of my death." He saw the light
          leap into her eyes. "I only say it," he added somewhat coldly, "because I will
          lie to you no longer. But it's a matter that concerns me alone." </p>
        <p>"How you alone? Am not I to be considered?" </p>
        <p>He rose and stood on the hearthrug, facing her. "I consider you all the time,"
          said he. </p>
        <p>"Listen,<hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="fr">mon cher ami,</foreign>"</hi> she
          said, looking up at him. "Let us understand one another. Is there anything about
          you, your birth or your life that I still don't know&mdash;I mean, anything
          essential?" </p>
        <p>"Nothing that matters," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Then let us speak once and for all, soul to soul. You and I are of those who
          can do it. <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">Eh bien.</foreign>
          </hi> I am a woman of old family, princely rank and fortune&mdash;
          you&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"By my father's death," said Paul, for the second time that day, "I am a rich
          man. We can leave out the question of fortune&mdash;except that the money I
          inherit was made out of a fried-fish shop business. That business was conducted
          by my father on lines of peculiar idealism. It will be my duty to carry on his
          work&mdash;at least"&mdash;he inwardly and conscientiously repudiated
          the idea of buying fish at Billingsgate at five <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0356"
            n="333"/> o'clock in the morning&mdash;"as far as the maintenance of his
          principles is concerned." </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">Soit</foreign></hi>," said the Princess,
          "we leave out the question of fortune. You are then a man of humble birth, and
          the rank you have gained for yourself." </p>
        <p>"I am a man of no name and of tarnished reputation. Good God!" he blazed out
          suddenly, losing control. "What is the good of torturing ourselves like this? If
          I wouldn't marry you&mdash;before&mdash;until I had done something in
          the front of the world to make you proud of me, what do you think I'll do now,
          lying in the gutter for every one to kick me? Would it be to the happiness of
          either of us for me to sneak through society behind your rank? It would be the
          death of me and you would come to hate me as a mean hound." </p>
        <p>"You? A mean hound?" Her voice broke and the tears welled up in her eyes. "You
          have done nothing for me to be proud of? You? You who did what you did last
          night? Yes, I was there. I saw and heard. Listen!" She rose to her feet and
          stood opposite to him, her eyes all stars, her figure trembling and her hands
          moving in her Frenchwoman's passionate gestures. "When I saw in the newspapers
          about your father, my heart was wrung for you. I knew what it meant. I knew how
          you must suffer. I came up straight to town. I wanted to be near you. I did not
          know how. I did not want you to see me. I called in my steward. 'How can I see
          the election?' We talked a little. He went and hired a room opposite the Town
          Hall. I waited there in the darkness. I thought it would last forever. And then
          came the result and the crowd cheered and I thought I should choke. I sobbed, I
          sobbed, I sobbed&mdash;and then you came. And I heard, and then I held out
          my arms <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0357" n="334"/> to you alone in the dark
          room&mdash;like this&mdash;and cried: 'Paul, Paul!"' Woman conquered.
          Madness surged through him and he flung his arms about her and they kissed long
          and passionately. </p>
        <p> "Whether you do me the honour of marrying me or not," she said a while later'
          flushed and triumphant, "our lives are joined together." </p>
        <p>And Paul, still shaken by the intoxication of her lips and hair and clinging
          pressure of her body, looked at her intensely with the eyes of a man's longing.
          But he said: "Nothing can alter what I said a few minutes ago&mdash;not all
          the passion and love in the world. You and I are not of the stuff, thank God, to
          cut ourselves adrift and bury ourselves in some romantic island and give up our
          lives to a dream. We're young. We're strong. We both know that life is a
          different sort of thing altogether from that. We're not of the sort that shirks
          its responsibilities. We've got to live in the world, you and I, and do the
          world's work." </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">"Parfaitement, mon bien aim&#x00E9;."</foreign>
          </hi> She smiled at him serenely. "I would not bury myself with you in an Ionian
          island for more than two months in a year for anything on earth. On my part, it
          would be the unforgivable sin. No woman has the right, however much she loves
          him, to ruin a man, any more than a man has the right to ruin a woman. But if
          you won't marry me, I'm perfectly willing to spend two months a year in an
          Ionian island with you," and she looked at him, very proud and fearless. </p>
        <p>Paul took her by the shoulders and shook her, more roughly than he realized.
          "Sophie, don't tempt me to a madness that we should both regret." </p>
        <p>She laughed, wincing yet thrilled, under the rude <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0358" n="335"/> handling, and freed herself. "But what
          more can a woman offer the man who loves her&mdash;that is to say if he does
          love her?" </p>
        <p>"I not love you?" He threw up his hands&mdash;"Dear God!" </p>
        <p>She waved him away and retreated a step or two, still laughing, as he advanced.
          "Then why won't you marry me? You're afraid." </p>
        <p>"Yes," he cried. "It's the only thing on this earth that I'm afraid of." </p>
        <p>"Why?" </p>
        <p>"The sneers. First you'd hate them. Then you'd hate and despise me." </p>
        <p>She grew serious. <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">"Calme-toi,</foreign>
          </hi> my dearest. just consider things practically. Who is going to sneer at a
          great man?" </p>
        <p>"I the first," replied Paul bitterly, his self-judgment warped by the new
          knowledge of the vanities and unsubstantialities on which his life had been
          founded. "I a great man, indeed!" </p>
        <p>"A very great man. A brilliant man I knew long ago. A brave man I have known,
          in spite of my pride, these last two or three awful weeks. But last night I knew
          you were a great man&mdash;a very great man. Ah, <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">mon</foreign>
          </hi> Paul. <hi rend="italic">

          </hi> whether it lives in Whitechapel or Park Lane, what does it matter to us ?" </p>
        <p>"The riff-raff, unfortunately," said Paul, "forms the general judgment of
          society." </p>
        <p>The Princess drew herself up in all her aristocratic dignity. "My Paul
          well-beloved," said she, "you have still one or two things to learn. People of
          greatness and rank march with their peers, and they can spit upon the <hi
            rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">canaille.</foreign>

          and it will take off its coronet and thank <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0359"
            n="336"/> you&mdash;and now," she said, resuming her seat on the sofa,
          among the cushions, "let us stop arguing. If there is any more arguing to be
          done, let us put it off to another occasion. Let us dismiss the questions of
          marriage and Ionian islands altogether, and let us talk pleasantly like dear
          friends who are reconciled." </p>
        <p>And with the wit of the woman who loves and the subtlety of the woman of the
          world she took Paul in her delicate hands and held him before her smiling eyes
          and made him tell her of all the things she wanted to know. And so Paul told her
          of all his life, of Bludston, of Barney Bill, of the model days, of the theatre,
          of Jane, of his father; and he showed her the cornelian heart and expounded its
          significance; and he talked of his dearest lady, Miss Winwood, and his work on
          the Young England League, and his failure to grip in this disastrous election,
          and he went back to the brickfield and his flight from the Life School, and his
          obsessing dream of romantic parentage and the pawning of his watch at Drane's
          Court; and in the full tide of it all a perturbed butler appeared at the door. </p>
        <p>"Can I speak a word to Your Highness?" </p>
        <p>She rose. The butler spoke the word. She burst out laughing. "My dear," she
          cried, "it's past nine o'clock. The household is in a state of agitation about
          dinner. We'll have it at once, Wilkins." </p>
        <p>The butler bowed and retired. </p>
        <p>The Princess laughed again. "Of course you'll stay. I left Stephanie at
          Morebury." </p>
        <p>And Paul stayed to dinner, and though, observing the flimsy compact, they
          dismissed the questions of Ionian islands and marriage, they talked till
          midnight of matters exceedingly pleasant.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXIII</head>

        <p>SO the lovers were reconciled, although the question of marriage was farther
          off than ever, and the Princess and Miss Winwood wept on each other's shoulders
          after the way of good women, and Paul declared that he needed no rest, and was
          eager to grapple with the world. He had much to do. First, he buried his dead,
          the Princess sending a great wreath and her carriage, after having had a queer
          interview with Jane, of which neither woman would afterwards speak a word; but
          it was evident that they had parted on terms of mutual respect and admiration.
          Then Paul went through the task of settling his father's affairs. Jane having
          expressed a desire to take over the management of a certain department of the
          business, he gladly entrusted it to her capable hands. He gave her the house at
          Hickney Heath, and Barney Bill took up his residence there as a kind of old
          watch-dog. Meanwhile, introduced by Frank Ayres and Colonel Winwood, he faced
          the ordeal of a chill reception by the House of Commons and took his seat. After
          that the nine-days' wonder of the scandal came to an end; the newspapers ceased
          talking of it and the general public forgot all about him. He only had to reckon
          with his fellow-members and with social forces. His own house too he had to put
          in order. He resigned his salary and position as Organizing Secretary of the
          Young England League, but as Honorary Secretary he retained control. To assure
          his position he applied for Royal Letters Patent and legalized his name of
          Savelli, <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0361" n="338"/> Finally, he plunged into the
          affairs of Fish Palaces Limited, and learned the many mysteries connected with
          that outwardly unromantic undertaking. </p>
        <p>These are facts in Paul's career which his chronicler is bound to mention. But
          on Paul's development they exercised but little influence. He walked now, with
          open eyes, in a world of real things. The path was difficult, but he was strong.
          Darkness lay ahead, but he neither feared it nor dreamed dreams of brightness
          beyond. The Vision Splendid had crystallized into an unconquerable purpose of
          which he felt the thrill. Without Sophie Zobraska's love he would have walked on
          doggedly, obstinately, with set teeth. He had proved himself fearless, scornful
          of the world's verdict. But he would have walked in wintry gloom with a young
          heart frozen dead. Now his path was lit by warm sunshine and the burgeon of
          spring was in his heart. He could laugh again in his old joyous way; yet the
          laughter was no longer that of the boy, but of the man who knew the place that
          laughter should hold in a man's life. </p>
        <p>On the day when he, as chairman, had first presided over a meeting of the Board
          of Directors of Fish Palaces Limited, he went to the Princess and said: "If I
          bring with me 'an ancient and fish-like smell, a kind of, not of the newest,
          Poor-John,' send me about my business." </p>
        <p>She bade him not talk foolishly. </p>
        <p>"I'm talking sense," said he. "I'm going through with it. I'm in trade. I know
          to the fraction of a penny how much fat ought to be used to a pound of hake, and
          I'm concentrating all my intellect on that fraction of a penny of fat." </p>

        <p>My dreams have come true. I am a king. The fried-fish king." </p>
        <p>Sophie looked at him from beneath her long lashes. "And I am a princess. We
          meet at last on equal terms." </p>
        <p>Paul sprang forward impulsively and seized her hands. "Oh, you dear, wonderful
          woman! Doesn't it matter to you that I'm running fried-fish shops?" </p>
        <p>"I know why you're doing it," she said. "I wouldn't have you do otherwise. You

        </p>
        <p>She laughed deliciously. Suddenly she paused, regarded him wide-eyed, with a
          smile on her lips. </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">Tiens</foreign></hi>! I have an idea. But

          I saw I was interested in Messrs. Jarrods Limited, and was engaged in selling
          hams and petticoats and notepaper and furniture and butter and&mdash;remark
          this&mdash;and fish. But raw fish. Now what the difference is between
          selling raw fish and fried fish, I do not know. <hi rend="italic"><foreign

        </p>
        <p>She laughed and Paul laughed too. They postponed, however, to an indefinite
          date, consideration of the business proposal. </p>
        <p>As Paul had foreseen, Society manifested no eagerness to receive him.
          Invitations no longer fell upon him in embarrassing showers. Nor did he make any
          attempt to pass through the once familiar doors. For <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0363" n="340"/> one thing, he was proud: for another he
          was too busy. When the Christmas recess came he took a holiday, went off by
          himself to Algiers. He returned bronzed and strong, to the joy of his Sophie. </p>
        <p>"My dear," said Miss Winwood one day to the curiously patient lady, "what is to
          come of it all? You can't go on like this for ever and ever." </p>
        <p>"We don't intend to," smiled the Princess. "Paul is born to great things. He
          cannot help it. It is his destiny, I believe in Paul." </p>
        <p>"So do I," replied Ursula. "But it's obvious that it will take him a good many
          years to achieve them. You surely aren't going to wait until he's a Cabinet
          Minister." </p>
        <p>The Princess lay back among her cushions and laughed. <hi rend="italic"
              >"<foreign lang="fr">Mais non</foreign></hi>. It will all come in woman's
          good time. <hi rend="italic">
            <foreign lang="fr">Laissez-moi faire</foreign>
          </hi>. He will soon begin to believe in himself again." </p>
        <p> At last Paul's opportunity arrived. The Whips had given him his chance to
          speak. His luck attended him, in so far that when his turn came he found a full
          House. It was on a matter of no vital importance; but he had prepared his speech
          carefully. He stood up for the first time in that strangely nerve-shaking
          assembly in which he had been received so coldly and in which he was still
          friendless, and saw the beginning of the familiar exodus into the lobbies. A
          sudden wave of anger swept through him and he tore the notes of his speech
          across and across, and again he metaphorically kicked Billy Goodge. He plunged
          into his speech, forgetful of what he had written, with a passion queerly
          hyperbolic in view of the subject. At the arresting tones of his voice many of
          the withdrawing members stopped at the bar and listened, then as he proceeded
          they gradually slipped back into their <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0364" n="341"
          /> places. Curiosity gave place to interest. Paul had found his gift again, and
          his anger soon lost itself completely in the joy of the artist. The House is
          always generous to performance. There was something novel in the spectacle of
          this young man, who had come there under a cloud, standing like a fearless young
          Hermes before them, in the ring of his beautiful voice, in the instinctive
          picturesqueness of phrase, in the winning charm of his personality. It was but a
          little point in a Government Bill that he had to deal with, and he dealt with it
          shortly. But he dealt with it in an unexpected, dramatic way, and he sat down
          amid comforting applause and circumambient smiles and nods. The old government
          hand who rose to reply complimented him gracefully and proceeded of course to
          tear his argument to tatters. Then an ill-conditioned Socialist Member got up,
          and, blundering and unconscious agent of Destiny in a fast-emptying House, began
          a personal attack on Paul. Whereupon there were cries of "Shame!" and "Sit
          down!" and the Speaker, in caustic tones, counselled relevancy, and the sympathy
          of the House went out to the Fortunate Youth; so that when he went soon
          afterwards into the outer lobby&mdash;it was the dinner hour&mdash;he
          found himself surrounded by encouraging friends. He did not wait long among
          them, for up in the Ladies' Gallery was his Princess. He tore up the stairs and
          met her outside. Her face was pale with anger. </p>
        <p>"The brute!" she whispered. "The cowardly brute !" </p>
        <p>He snapped his fingers. <hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">Canaille,
              canaille!</foreign></hi> He counts for nothing. But I've got them!" he cried
          exultingly, holding out clenched fists. "By God, darling, I've got them! They'll
          listen to me now!" </p>
        <p>She looked at him and the sudden tears came. "Thank God," she said, "I can hear
          you talk like that at last." <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0365" n="342"/>
        </p>
        <p>He escorted her down the stone stairs and through the lobby to her car, and
          they were objects of many admiring eyes. When they reached it she said, with a
          humorous curl of the lip, <hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">Veux-tu
              m'&#x00E9;pouser maintenant</foreign></hi>?" </p>
        <p>"Wait, only wait," said he. "These are only fireworks. Very soon we'll get to
          the real thing." </p>
        <p>"We shall, I promise you," she replied enigmatically; and she drove off. </p>
        <p> One morning, a fortnight later, she rang him up. "You're coming to dine with
          me on Friday, as usual, aren't you ?" </p>
        <p>"Of course," said he. "Why do you ask?" </p>
        <p>"Just to make sure. And yes&mdash;also&mdash;to tell you not to come
          till half-past eight." </p>
        <p>She rang off. Paul thought no more of the matter. Ever since he had taken his
          seat in the House he had dined with her alone every Friday evening. It was their
          undisturbed hour of intimacy and gladness in the busy week. Otherwise they
          rarely met, for Paul was a pariah in her social world. </p>
        <p>On the Friday in question his taxi drew up before an unusual-looking house in
          Berkeley Square. An awning projected from the front door and a strip of carpet
          ran across the pavement. At the sound of the taxi, the door opened and revealed
          the familiar figures of the Princess's footmen in their state livery. He
          entered, somewhat dazed. </p>
        <p>"Her Highness has a party?" he asked. </p>
        <p>"Yes, sir. A very large dinner party." </p>
        <p>Paul passed his hand over his forehead. What did it mean? "This is Friday,
          isn't it?" </p>
        <p>"Of course, sir." </p>
        <p>Paul grew angry. It was a woman's trap to force him on society. For a moment he
          struggled with the <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0366" n="343"/> temptation to walk
          away after telling the servant that it was a mistake and that he had not been
          invited. At once, however, came realization of social outrage. He surrendered
          hat and coat and let himself be announced. The noise of thirty voices struck his
          ear as he entered the great drawing-room. He was confusedly aware of a glitter
          of jewels, and bare arms and shoulders and the black and white of men. But
          radiant in the middle of the room stood his Princess, with a tiara of diamonds
          on her head, and beside her stood a youngish man whose face seemed oddly
          familiar. </p>
        <p>Paul advanced, kissed her hand. </p>
        <p>She laughed gaily. "You are late, Paul." </p>
        <p>"You said half-past, Princess. I am here to the minute." </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">Je te dirai
            apr&#x00E8;s</foreign></hi>," she said, and the daring of the intimate
          speech took his breath away. </p>
        <p>"Your Royal Highness," she turned to the young man beside her&mdash;and
          then Paul suddenly recognized a prince of the blood royal of
          England&mdash;"may I present Mr. Savelli." </p>
        <p>"I'm very pleased to meet you," said the Prince graciously. "Your Young England
          League has interested me greatly. We must have a talk about it one of these
          days, if you can spare the time. And I must congratulate you on your speech the
          other night." </p>
        <p>"You are far too kind, sir," said Paul. </p>
        <p>They chatted for a minute or two. Then the Princess said: "You'll take in the
          Countess of Danesborough. I don't think you've met her; but you'll find she's an
          old friend." </p>
        <p>"Old friend?" echoed Paul. </p>
        <p>She smiled and turned to a pretty and buxom woman of forty standing near. "My
          dear Lady Danesborough. Here is Mr. Savelli, whom you are so anxious to meet."
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0367" n="344"/>
        </p>
        <p>Paul bowed politely. His head being full of his Princess, he was vaguely
          puzzled as to the reasons for which Lady Danesborough desired his acquaintance. </p>
        <p>"You don't remember me," she said. </p>
        <p>He looked at her squarely for the first time; then started back. "Good God 1"
          he cried involuntarily. "Good God! I've been wanting to find you all my life. I
          never knew your name. But here's the proof." </p>
        <p>And he whipped out the cornelian heart from his waistcoat pocket. She took it
          in her hand, examined it, handed it back to him with a smile, a very sweet and
          womanly smile, with just the suspicion of mist veiling her eyes. </p>
        <p>"I know. The Princess has told me." </p>
        <p>"But how did she find you out&mdash;I mean as my first patroness ?" </p>
        <p>"She wrote to the vicar, Mr. Merewether&mdash;he is still at
          Bludston&mdash;asking who his visitor was that year and what had become of
          her. So she found out it was 1. I've known her off and on ever since my
          marriage." </p>
        <p>"You were wonderfully good to me," said Paul. "I must have been a funny little
          wretch." </p>
        <p>"You've travelled far since then." </p>
        <p>"It was you that gave me my inspiration," said he. </p>
        <p>The announcement of dinner broke the thread of the talk. Paul looked around him
          and saw that the room was filled with very great people indeed. There were
          chiefs of his party and other exalted personages. There was Lord Francis Ayres.
          Also the Winwoods. The procession was formed. </p>
        <p>"I've often wondered about you," said Lady Danesborough, as they were walking
          down the wide staircase. "Several thin happened to mark that day. For one, I had
          spilled a bottle of awful scent all over my dress and I was in a state of
          odoriferous misery." <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0368" n="345"/>
        </p>
        <p>Paul laughed boyishly. "The mystery of my life is solved at last." He
          explained, to her frank delight. "You've not changed a bit," said he. "And oh! I
          can't tell you how good it is to meet you after all. these years." </p>
        <p>"I'm very, very glad you feel so," she said significantly. "More than glad. I
          was wondering . . . but our dear Princess was right." </p>
        <p>"It seems to me that-the Princess has been playing conspirator," said Paul. </p>
        <p>They entered the great dining-room, very majestic with its long, glittering
          table, its service of plate, its stately pictures, its double row of powdered
          and liveried footmen, and Paul learned, to his amazement, that in violation of
          protocols and tables of precedence, his seat was on the right hand of the
          Princess. Conspiracy again. Hitherto at her parties he had occupied his proper
          place. Never before had she publicly given him especial mark of her favour. </p>
        <p>"Do you think she's right in doing this?" he murmured to Lady Danesborough. </p>
        <p>It seemed so natural that he should ask her&mdash;as though she were fully
          aware of all his secrets. </p>
        <p>"I think so," she smiled&mdash;as though she too were in the conspiracy. </p>
        <p>They halted at their places, and there, at the centre of the long table, on the
          right of the young Prince stood the Princess, with flushed face and shining
          eyes, looking very beautiful and radiantly defiant. </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">M&#x00E9;chante</foreign></hi>," Paul
          whispered, as they sat down. "This is a trap." </p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">Je le sais. Tu est bien prise, petite
              souris.</foreign>"</hi>

        </p>
        <p>It pleased her to be gay. She confessed unblushingly. Her little mouse was well
          caught. The little mouse grew rather stern, and when the great company had
          settled down, and the hum of talk arisen, he deliberately <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0369" n="346"/> scanned the table. He met some friendly
          glances&mdash;a Cabinet Minister nodded pleasantly. He also met some that
          were hostile. His Sophie had tried a dangerous experiment. In Lady Danesborough,
          the Maisie Shepherd of his urchindom, whose name he had never known, she had
          assured him a sympathetic and influential partner. Also, although he had
          tactfully not taken up that lady's remark, he felt proud of his Princess's
          glorious certainty that he would have no false and contemptible shame in the
          encounter. She had known that it would be a joy to him; and it was. The truest
          of the man was stirred. They talked and laughed about the far-off day. Incidents
          flaming in his mind had faded from hers. He recalled forgotten things. Now and
          then she said: "Yes, I know that. The Princess has told me." Evidently his
          Sophie was a conspirator of deepest dye. </p>
        <p>"And now you're the great Paul Savelli," she said. </p>
        <p>"Great?" He laughed. "In what way?" </p>
        <p>"Before this election you were a personage. I've never run across you because
          we've been abroad so much, you know&mdash;my husband has a depraved taste
          for governing places&mdash;but a year or two ago we were asked to the
          Chudleys, and you were held out as an inducement." </p>
        <p>"Good Lord!" said Paul, astonished. </p>
        <p>"And now, of course, you're the most-discussed young man in London. Is he
          damned or isn't he? You know what I refer to." </p>
        <p>"Well, am I?' he asked pleasantly. </p>
        <p>"I'm glad to see you take it like that. It's not the way of the little people.
          Personally, I've stuck up for you, not knowing in the least who you were. I
          thought you did the big, spacious thing. It gave me a thrill when I read about
          it. Your speech in the House has helped you a lot. Altogether&mdash;and now
          considering <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0370" n="Illustration"/>
          <!--<head>"The mystery of my life is solved at last"</head>-->
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0371"/>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0372" n="347"/> our early acquaintance&mdash;I
          think I'm justified in calling you 'the great Paul Savelli.' " </p>
        <p>Then came the shifting of talk. The Prince turned to his left-hand neighbour;
          Lady Danesborough to her right. Paul and the Princess had their conventional
          opportunity for conversation. She spoke in French, daringly using the intimate
            <hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">tu</foreign>"</hi>; but of all sorts of
          things&mdash;books, theatres, picture shows. Then tactfully she drew the
          Prince and his neighbour and Lady Danesborough into their circle, and, pulling
          the strings, she at last brought Paul and the Prince into a discussion over the
          pictures of the Doges in the Ducal Palace in Venice. The young Prince was
          gracious. Paul, encouraged to talk and stimulated by precious memories, grew
          interesting. The Princess managed to secure a set of listeners at the opposite
          side of the table. Suddenly, as if carrying on the theme, she said in a
          deliberately loud voice, compelling attention: "Your Royal Highness, I am in a
          dilemma." </p>
        <p>"What is it?" </p>
        <p>She paused, looked round and widened her circie. "For the past year I have been
          wanting Mr. Savelli to ask me to marry him, and he obstinately refuses to do so.
          Will you tell me, sir, what a poor woman is to do?" </p>
        <p>She addressed herself exclusively to the young Prince; but her voice, with its
          adorable French intonation, rang high and clear. Paul, suddenly white and rigid,
          clenched the hand of the Princess which happened to lie within immediate reach.
          A wave of curiosity, arresting talk, spread swiftly down. There was an uncanny,
          dead silence, broken only by a raucous voice proceeding from a very fat Lord of
          Appeal some distance away: </p>
        <p>"After my bath I always lie flat on my back and bring my knees up to my chin."
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0373" n="348"/>
        </p>
        <p>There was a convulsive, shrill gasp of laughter, which would have instantly
          developed into an hysterical roar, had not the young Prince, with quick, tactful
          disregard of British convention, sprung to his feet, and with one hand holding
          champagne glass, and the other uplifted, commanded silence. So did the stars in
          their courses still fight for Paul. "My lords, ladies and gentlemen," said the
          Prince, "I have the pleasure to announce the engagement of Her Highness the
          Princess Sophie Zobraska and Mr. Paul Savelli. I ask you to drink to their
          health and wish them every happiness." </p>
        <p>He bowed to the couple, lifted his glass, and standing, swept a quick glance
          round the company, and at the. royal command the table rose, dukes and duchesses
          and Cabinet Ministers, the fine flowers of England, and drank to Paul and his
          Princess. </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">Attrape!</foreign>"</hi> she whispered,
          as they got up together, hand in hand. And as they stood, in their superb
          promise of fulfilment, they conquered. The Princess said: <hi rend="italic"
              >"<foreign lang="fr">Mais dis quelque chose, toi</foreign></hi>." </p>
        <p>And Paul met the flash in her eyes, and he smiled. "Your Royal Highness, my
          lords, ladies and gentlemen," said he, while all the company were racking their
          brains to recall a precedent for such proceedings at a more than formal London
          dinner party; "the Princess and myself thank you from our hearts. For me this
          might almost seem the end of the fairy-tale of my life, in which&mdash;when
          I was eleven years old&mdash;her ladyship the Countess of Danesborough" (he
          bowed to the Maisie of years ago), "whom I have not seen from that day to this,
          played the part of Fairy Godmother. She gave me a talisman then to help me in my
          way through the world. I have it still." He held up the cornelian heart. "It
          guided my steps to my <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0374" n="349"/> dearest lady,
          Miss Winwood, in whose beloved service I lived so long. It has brought me to the
          feet of my Fairy Princess. But now the fairy-tale is over. I begin where the
          fairy-tales end"&mdash;he laughed into his Sophie's eyes&mdash;"I begin
          in the certain promise of living happy ever afterwards." </p>
        <p>In this supreme hour of his destiny there spoke the old, essential Paul, the
          believer in the Vision Splendid. The instinctive appeal to the romantic ringing
          so true and so sincere awoke responsive chords in hearts which, after all, as is
          the simple way of hearts of men and women, were very human. </p>
        <p>He sat down a made man, amid pleasant laughter and bowings and lifting of
          glasses, the length of the long table. </p>
        <p>Lady Danesborough said gently: "It was charming of you to bring me in. But I
          shall be besieged with questions. What on earth shall I tell them?" </p>
        <p>"The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth," he replied. "What do
          the Princess and I care?" </p>
        <p>Later in the evening he managed to find himself alone for a moment with the
          Princess. "My wonderful Sophie, what can I say to you?" </p>
        <p>She smiled victoriously. "Cry quits. Confess that you have not the monopoly of
          the grand manner. You have worked in your man's way&mdash;I in my woman's
          way." </p>
        <p>"You took a great risk," said he. </p>
        <p>Her eyes softened adorably. <hi rend="italic">"<foreign lang="fr">Non, mon
              Paul, ch&#x00E9;ri. C'&#x00E9;tait tout
              arrang&#x00E9;.</foreign></hi> It was a certainty." </p>
        <p>And then, Paul's dearest lady came up and pressed both their hands. "I am so
          glad. Oh, so glad." The tears started. "But it <hi rend="italic">is</hi>
          something like a fairy-tale, isn't it?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0375" n="350"

        <p>Well, as far as his chronicler can say at present, that is the end of the
          Fortunate Youth. But it is really only a beginning. Although his party is still
          in opposition, he is still young; his sun is rising and he is rich in the glory
          thereof. A worldful of great life lies before him and his Princess. What limit
          can we set to their achievement? Of course he was the Fortunate Youth. Of that
          there is no gainsaying. He had his beauty, his charm, his temperament, his quick
          southern intelligence&mdash;all his Sicilian heritage&mdash;and a
          freakish chance had favoured him from the day that, vagabond urchin, he attended
          his first and only Sunday-school treat. But personal gifts and favouring chance
          are not everything in this world. </p>
        <p>On the day before his wedding he had a long talk with Barney Bill. </p>
        <p> "Sonny," said the old man, scratching his white poll, when yer used to talk
          about princes and princesses, I used to larf&mdash;larf fit to bust myself.
          I never let yer seen me do it, sonny, for all the time you was so dead serious.
          And now it has come true. And d'yer know why it's come true, sonny?" He cocked
          his head on one side, his little diamond eyes glittering, and laid a hand on
          Paul's knee. "D'yer know why? Because yer believed in it. I ain't had much
          religion, not having, so to speak, much time for it, also being an old crock of
          a pagan&mdash;but I do remember as what Christ said about
          faith&mdash;just a mustard seed of it moving mountains. That's it, sonny.
          I've observed lots of things going round in the old 'bus. Most folks believe in
          nothing. What's the good of 'em? Move mountains? They're paralytic in front of a
          dunghill. I know what I'm talking about, bless yer. Now you come along believing
          in yer 'igh-born parents. I larfed, knowing as who yer parents were. But you
          believed, and I had to let you believe. And you be- <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002640_0376" n="351"/> lieved in your princes and princesses,
          and your being born to great things. And I couldn't sort of help believing in it
          too." </p>
        <p>Paul laughed. "Things happen to have come out all right, but God knows why." </p>
        <p>"He does," said Barney Bill very seriously. "That's just what He does know. He
          knows you had faith." </p>
        <p>"And you, dear old man?" asked Paul, "what have you believed in?" </p>
        <p>"My honesty, sonny," replied Barney Bill, fixing him with his bright eyes. "
          'Tain't much. 'Tain't very ambitious-like. But I've had my temptations. I never
          drove a crooked bargain in my life." </p>
        <p>Paul rose and walked a step or two. </p>
        <p>"You're a better man than I am, Bill." </p>
        <p>Barney Bill rose too, rheumatically, and laid both hands on the young man's
          shoulders. "Have you ever been false to what you really believed to be true?" </p>
        <p>"Not essentially," said Paul. </p>
        <p>"Then it's all right, sonny," said the old man very earnestly, his bent,
          ill-clad figure, his old face wizened by years of exposure to suns and frosts,
          contrasting oddly with the young favourite of fortune. "It's all right. Your
          father believed in one thing. I believe in another. You believe in something
          else. But it doesn't matter a tuppenny damn what one believes in, so long as
          it's worth believing in. It's faith, sonny, that does it. Faith and purpose." </p>
        <p>"You're right," said Paul. "Faith and purpose." </p>
        <p>"I believed in yer from the very first, when you were sitting down reading Sir
          Walter with the bead and tail off. And I believed in yer when yer used to tell
          about being 'born to great things! " </p>
        <p>Paul laughed. "That was all childish rubbish," said he. </p>
        <p>"Rubbish?" cried the old man, his head more <pb entity="DSSR_000002640_0377"
            n="352"/> crooked, his eyes more bright, his gaunt old figure more twisted
          than ever. "Haven't yer got the great things yer believed yer were born to?
          Ain't yer rich? Ain't yer famous? Ain't yer a Member of Parliament? Ain't yer
          going to marry a Royal Princess? Good God Almighty! what more d'yer want?" </p>
        <p>"Nothing in the wide, wide world!" laughed Paul.</p>
