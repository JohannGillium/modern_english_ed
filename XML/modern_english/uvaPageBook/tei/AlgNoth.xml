<lg type="stanza">
<l>AUGUSTUS FITZ-HERBERT, as all are aware,
</l><l>Having crossed the Atlantic, and got a moustache on,
</l><l>Likewise being son of a known millionaire,
</l><l>Stands of course on the very top round of the fashion.
</l><l>Being taught to consider himself, from his birth,
</l><l>As one of the privileged ones of the earth,
</l><l>He cherishes deep and befitting disdain
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0023" n="6"/>
</l><l>For those who don't live in the Fifth Avenue,
</l><l>As entirely unworthy the notice or thought
</l><l>Of the heir of two millions and nothing to do.
</l><l>He calls them canaille, which I'm credibly told
</l><l>Is the only French word which he caught when away;
</l><l>And though, in my case, if I might be so bold,
</l><l>I should say it scarce paid one for half a year's stay,
</l><l>The heir of two millions and nothing to do,
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0024" n="7"/>

</l><l>Who lives in a palace in Fifth Avenue,
</l><l>As a matter of course, is no-fitting comparison
</l><l>For the heir of an inkstand and something to do,
</l><l>Who lodges up stairs, in the house of Miss Harrison.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>In this model republic, this land of the free&mdash;
</l><l>So our orators call it, and why should not we?&mdash;
</l><l>'Tis refreshing to know that without pedigree
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0025" n="8"/>

</l><l>A man may still climb to the top of the tree;
</l><l>That questions of family, rank, and high birth,
</l><l>All bow to the query, How much is he worth?
</l><l>That John Smith, plebeian, who forty years since
</l><l>Walked Broadway barefooted, now rides as a prince;
</l><l>Having managed, though not overburdened with wit,
</l><l>But rather by chance and a fortunate hit,
</l><l>To take a high place of Society's rounds;
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0026" n="9"/>

</l><l>His claim, being based on pence, shillings, and pounds.
</l><l>I admit there's a certain  republican merit
</l><l>In making the fortune which others inherit;
</l><l>But why should John  Smith so completely ignore
</l><l>The bridge which has brought him triumphantly o'er,
</l><l>And turn with disgust from the opposite shore?
</l><l>And     why when  Miranda, whose heart is not proof
</l><l>Against Cupid's sharp arrows, some day leaves his roof,
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0027" n="10"/>

</l><l>And, sundering her family ties at a jerk,
</l><l>Returns in the evening -the wife of his clerk!
</l><l>Thus at Love's trumpet-call bidding Duty defiance,
</l><l>Should he strive to break up the clandestine alliance?
</l><l>For, though men have made money, and will do again,
</l><l>There as never a case known here money made men
</l><l>And if Jones be a man in what constitutes manhood,
</l><l>He's a far better match than young Frederic Stanwood,
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0028" n="11"/>

</l><l>Though the one be a clerk, and the other the heir
</l><l>Of the house, next M'Flimsey's, on Madison-square.
</l><l>If the one is deficient in wealth, we may find
</l><l>The other quite bankrupt in morals and mind.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Excuse this digression, which yet is germain
</l><l>To the subject in band, as will be very plain
</l><l>When I say that Fitz-Herbert's respected progenitor
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0029" n="12"/>

</l><l>Did business years since, as I'm told, in a den eight or
</l><l>Ten feet each way, where he daily had calls
</l><l>From all sorts of people with all sorts of things,
</l><l>From coats and umbrellas to bracelets and rings,
</l><l>To be left, until claimed, at the Three Golden Balls.
</l><l>But now, long emerged from his chrysalis state,
</l><l>Should his former acquaintances call at his gate,
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0030" n="13"/>

</l><l>They would doubtless receive speedy notice to leave&mdash;
</l><l>Not the articles brought, but the dwelling instanter,
</l><l>With their pace perhaps changed to a very quick canter.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>So changes the world, and the men that are in it,
</l><l>That those whom we hail as our equals, one minute,
</l><l>We pass by the next with a very cold stare,
</l><l>And gruffly inquire who the d-ickens they are.
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0031" n="14"/>

</l><l>From the past to the present&mdash;to close our review&mdash;
</l><l>From the pawnbroker's shop to the Fifth Avenue,
</l><l>To the parlors so full of objects de vertu,
</l><l>And furniture most undeniably new,
</l><l>Where on tapestry carpets the foot softly falls,
</l><l>And family portraits look down from the walls,
</l><l>Of martial old grandsires and stately old dames;
</l><l>Which, bought cheap at auction, and set in new frames,
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0032" n="15"/>

</l><l>And dubbed with high-sounding and fanciful names,
</l><l>At peace after many of Fortune's mutations,
</l><l>Look impressively down on their new-found relations.
</l><l>There's Sir Arthur Fitz-Herbert an old English knight,
</l><l>Who won his gold spurs in a hardly-fought field,
</l><l>Where be rescued the life of the gallant Black Prince
</l><l>By receiving a blow meant for him&mdash;on his shield;


<pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0033" n="16"/>



</l><l>Of which glorious action, so well worth attention,
</l><l>Not a single historian makes any mention;
</l><l>Though by family documents amply attested,
</l><l>In possession of those who are most interested.
</l><l>Then there's Lady Fitz-Herbert&mdash;a Queen's maid of honor,
</l><l>Who spent her chief time in attendance upon her;
</l><l>And when the Queen left on a visit to Calais,
</l><l>Remained in sole charge of&mdash;the plate and the palace.
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0034" n="17"/>

</l><l>All which, the Fitz-Herberts may justly lay claim,
</l><l>Invests with proud honor the family name.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>There is something that puzzles me, let me confess&mdash;
</l><l>Why these old antiques wear so modern a dress!
</l><l>Unless, like the comet which now reappears,
</l><l>For the first time, I think, within hundreds of years,
</l><l>So fashions in dress run through regular courses,
</l><l>And strictly obey the mechanical forces.
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0035" n="18"/>

</l><l>Let me hereby suggest that some almanac-maker,
</l><l>In his very next issue but one, undertake a
</l><l>Brief record of Fashions that may reappear
</l><l>In the course of the next or the following year.
</l><l>With what eager eyes would our wives read, be sure,
</l><l>About&mdash;this&mdash;time&mdash;expect&mdash;a&mdash;new&mdash;style&mdash;of&mdash;coiffure,
</l><l>A black lace Fichu under dark satin loops;
</l><l>Or, more ominous still, a recurrence of hoops!
</l><l>Attended, perhaps, by the brief intimation,
</l><l>Based upon strict and exact calculation,
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0036" n="19"/>

</l><l>That the first would enjoy but a limited reign, as
</l><l>It was looked for next year in far-distant Uranus;
</l><l>While the last had intended to visit us sooner,
</l><l>But tarried a while with the ladies of Luna.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Apropos of the portraits&mdash;I've heard of a queer
</l><l>Contretemps which befell the most famous last year;
</l><l>I mean of Sir Arthur, who saved the Black Prince,&mdash;
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0037" n="20"/>

</l><l>Excuse my not knowing how many years since.
</l><l>It seems a young lady&mdash;Miss Blanche Delarue&mdash;
</l><l>One day on a visit to Fifth Avenue,
</l><l>While carelessly chatting and sipping some sherbet,
</l><l>Was shown the fine portrait of Arthur Fitz-Herbert,
</l><l>Which, Augustus assured her, as an heirloom
</l><l>Was more valued than anything else in the room,
</l><l>And proceeded to speak of the well-deserved fame
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0038" n="21"/>

</l><l>Of Sir Arthur Fitz-Herbert, the first of his name,
</l><l>With a few of those actions of gallant emprise,
</l><l>Which have made him so great in Posterity's eyes;
</l><l>Or, at least, that small part which, like Miss Delarue,
</l><l>Are on visiting terms in the Fifth Avenue.
</l><l>In the midst of his story conceive hi amaze,
</l><l>When his visitor, after a long earnest gaze
</l><l>At the portrait before her, approaching, let fall
</l><l>On the tapestry carpet plate, sherbet, and all,
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0039" n="22"/>

</l><l>Which, scattered with fragments of fine porcelain,
</l><l>Must have suffered, I fear, an indelible stain.
</l><l>While standing aghast at a breach of propriety
</l><l>Which rarely occurs in the best of society,
</l><l>He was startled still more, as I cannot but own,
</l><l>When the lady exclaimed, in a deeply-moved tone,
</l><l>In reply to his feebly-expressed "Never mind it,'
</l><l>'That's my grandfather's portrait! 0, where did you find it?"
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0040" n="23"/>

</l><l>Which indeed was the case, being sold at vendue,
</l><l>Some years since, when the father of Blanche Delarue
</l><l>Had lost for the time both his wealth and high station,
</l><l>By indulging too largely in land speculation.
</l><l>The unlucky portrait, I scarcely need say,
</l><l>Was at once taken down, but soon after replaced
</l><l>By another as stately, though somewhat defaced,&mdash;
</l><l>A clear mark of age, and which, by the way,
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0041" n="24"/>

</l><l>On Fitz-Herbert's assurance I'm glad to be able
</l><l>To say was a knight of the Famous Round Table.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>If my memory fails not, 'tis three months to-day
</l><l>Since Augustus Fitz-Herbert appeared in Broadway,
</l><l>Having passed the last year in a tour beyond seas,
</l><l>Where his travels extended from Russia to Spain,
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0042" n="25"/>

</l><l>And towards the North-West from the famed Hebrides
</l><l>To the beautiful isles in the fair Grecian main.
</l><l>He has wandered through climes of which even the names
</l><l>Thrill the heart with emotion, or summon a tear,
</l><l>When we think how completely has time swept away
</l><l>The traces of all that we fain would revere.
</l><l>He has stood, it may be, on the very same spot
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0043" n="26"/>

</l><l>Where Homer recited his deathless heroics,
</l><l>Or paused at the portico, knowing it not,
</l><l>Where Zeno addressed his disciples, the Stoics.
</l><l>Perchance when the gazed from the brow of the hill
</l><l>On the once famous harbor&mdash;the Attic Piraeus,&mdash;
</l><l>Proud trophy of valor reverse could not chill!&mdash;
</l><l>His foot pressed the turf on the breast of Musaeus.
</l><l>He has seen the proud city whose arts and whose arms
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0044" n="27"/>

</l><l>In the mouth of tradition for ages have rung;
</l><l>0, there is not a foot of that soil but has charms,
</l><l>Where Tully once fulmined, where Virgil once sung.
</l><l>In the streets of Byzantium he's smoked a chibouk
</l><l>With the bearded and turbaned devout Mameluke;
</l><l>Has seen the Cathedral&mdash;the glory of Munich&mdash;
</l><l>And deciphered inscriptions, <hi rend="italic">perhaps,</hi> from the Runic;
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0045" n="28"/>

</l><l>Floated dreamily down the thrice beautiful Rhine,
</l><l>Through lands that are teeming with olives and wine;
</l><l>Passed a night in the capital city of Berne,
</l><l>And crossed in a steamer the Lake of Lucerne;
</l><l>Has strolled through the fortified town of Brussels,
</l><l>And heard in old Bruges the sweet Minster bells;
</l><l>Has stopped in the siege-renowned city of Prague,
</l><l>And supped with Mynheer in his town of the Hague;
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0046" n="29"/>

</l><l>At length reaching France, in a steamboat crossed over
</l><l>The troublesome straits linking Calais with Dover;
</l><l>Which gained, up to London be travelled post-haste,
</l><l>With the prominent thought, there was no time to waste.
</l><l>With the help of post-horses and frequent relays,
</l><l>He "did" the whole island in eight or ten days,
</l><l>During which he no doubt made a thorough survey
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0047" n="30"/>

</l><l>Of all objects of interest passed on the way.
</l><l>He next made a very brief visit to Cork
</l><l>(The city and people he couldn't endure),
</l><l>And returning took passage at once to New York,
</l><l>With the comforting thought&mdash;he had made the grand tour.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>From his journal I venture below to record
</l><l>A single impression received while abroad:
</l><l>"June 7th, we reached Athens&mdash;a sizable place,
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0048" n="31"/>

</l><l>Some three or four miles from the Gulf of &AElig;gina;
</l><l>it contains a cathedral not equal to Grace
</l><l>Church in New York, which I think is much finer.
</l><l>Went up to the top of the famous Acropolis,
</l><l>Which is visited daily by hundreds of people,
</l><l>But can't say I think that the view from the top o' this
</l><l>Is equal to that from our Trinity steeple.
</l><l>The houses are mostly unsightly and small;
</l><l>In Minerva and Hermes' street noticed a few
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0049" n="32"/>

</l><l>Which will do very well, but are nothing at all
</l><l>Compared with our mansion in Fifth-Avenue.
</l><l>The piles of old ruins one sees here and there
</l><l>I consider a perfect disgrace to the town;
</l><l>If they had an efficient and competent Mayor,
</l><l>Like our Mayor Wood, he would soon have them down."</l>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Returned from his tour, he may daily be seen
</l><l>Promenading Broadway with a calm air of <orig reg="superiority">su-</orig>
</l><l><orig reg="superiority">Periority,</orig> such as is rightfully worn
</l><l>By the Heir of two millions and nothing to do.
</l><l>Observe how be shrinks, with a languid disdain,
</l><l>From a shabby book-keeper with coat worse for wear;
</l><l>It would scarce be befitting for fine porcelain
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0051" n="34"/>

</l><l>To come in close contact with common delf-ware.
</l><l>He inclines, as I think, in regard to the masses,
</l><l>In a modified form to the views of Agassiz:
</l><l>As that Adam the first has another for weedin',
</l><l>And other such jobs, in the garden of Eden;
</l><l>While Eve has a housemaid&mdash;the wife of the latter,
</l><l>Of color uncertain&mdash;perhaps a mulatto,
</l><l>Who lives in the kitchen, cooks, washes, and starches,
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0052" n="35"/>

</l><l>While Eve in the parlor plays waltzes and marches;
</l><l>And that those who perforce bear the burdens of life
</l><l>Date their origin back to this man and his wife,
</l><l>While from Adam the first are descended the few
</l><l>Who are blest with long purses and nothing to do.
</l><l>An exceedingly simple and practical way
</l><l>Of explaining the present distinction of classes,
</l><l>Conclusively showing that much finer clay
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0053" n="36"/>

</l><l>Is required for the rich than the general masses.</l>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Augustus last week at the Potiphars' party
</l><l>Met Flora M'Flimsey, of Madison-square,
</l><l>Who having found out from her friend Miss Astarte
</l><l>That he&mdash;a great catch&mdash;it was thought would be there,
</l><l>Although in a state of extreme destitution
</l><l>In regard to apparel befitting to wear,
</l><l>With her usual promptness and firm resolution
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0054" n="37"/>

</l><l>Represented the case to her hard-hearted p&egrave;re;
</l><l>Who firmly resisted her touching entreaties,
</l><l>Until she was forced, in her utter despair,
</l><l>To remind him she never could hope to be married,
</l><l>Unless he provided her something to wear.
</l><l>A state of the case so extremely appalling,
</l><l>And fraught with such numberless bills of expense
</l><l>To be run up hereafter, that, trouble forestalling,
</l><l>He yielded at once, without further defence.
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0055" n="38"/>

</l><l>At the same time he said she was perfectly free
</l><l>To place herself under a husband's protection;
</l><l>And, hard as the sacrifice doubtless must be,
</l><l>Provided she made a befitting parti,
</l><l>That he, as her father, would make no objection.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Her pupose achieved, on the very same day
</l><l>Miss Flora went out on a tour of inspection
</l><l>To all of the principal shops in Broadway,
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0056" n="39"/>

</l><l>Where at length she succeeded in making election
</l><l>Of a gossamer fabric of delicate texture,
</l><l>Whose merit consisted in being so rare,
</l><l>That one, though attired in it twice or thrice folded,
</l><l>Might almost be said to have nothing to wear.
</l><l>At the party which followed (I speak with due diffidence),
</l><l>Of all that were present not one could compare,
</l><l>In point of dry goods and surpassing magnificence,
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0057" n="40"/>

</l><l>With Flora M'Flimsey, of Madison-square.
</l><l>She came, saw, and conquered.  Her eyes' brilliant lustre&mdash;
</l><l>Or that of her diamonds&mdash;effected the coup
</l><l>Which brought to her feet&mdash;not the great Filibuster,
</l><l>But the heir of two millions and nothing to do.
</l><l>The marriage, I hear, is deferred for the present&mdash;
</l><l>The bride requires three months at least to prepare.
</l><l>On the first of November, should weather prove pleasant,
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002531_0058" n="41"/>

</l><l>There will be a grand wedding, at Madison-square.
</l><l>The alliance I bold to be every way proper,
</l><l>Since Flora M'Flimsey, in wedding the heir
</l><l>Of two millions in prospect (not bating a copper),
</l><l>May hope to have something, in future, to wear.
</l><l>While Augustus Fitz-Herbert, Sir Arthur's decendant,
</l><l>In paying her bills for dry goods and bijoux,
</l><l>With all the etceteras thereto attendant,
</l><l>Will find quite as much as he wishes to do.</l>

<l>0, ye who in life are content to be drones,
