<head type="divisional">THE YATES PRIDE</head>

<p>OPPOSITE Miss Eudora Yates's old colonial mansion was the perky
modern Queen Anne residence of Mrs. Joseph Glynn.  Mrs. Glynn had a
daughter, Ethel, and an un-married sister, Miss Julia Esterbrook.  All
three were fond of talking, and had many callers who liked to hear the
feebly effervescent news of Well-wood.  This afternoon three ladies
were there: Miss Abby Simson, Mrs. John Bates, and Mrs. Edward Lee.
They sat in the Glynn sitting-room, which shrilled with treble voices as

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0023" n="4"/>

if a flock of sparrows had settled therein.</p>

<p>The Glynn sitting-room was charming, mainly because of the quantity
of flowering plants.  Every window was filled with them, until the room
seemed like a conservatory.  Ivy, too, climbed over the pictures, and
the mantel-shelf was a cascade of wandering Jew, growing in old china
vases.</p>

<p>"Your plants are really wonderful, Mrs. Glynn," said Mrs. Bates, "but
I don't see how you manage to get a glimpse of anything outside the
house, your windows are so full of them."</p>

<p>"Maybe she can see and not be seen," said Abby Simson, who had a
quick wit and a ready tongue.</p>

<p>Mrs. Joseph Glynn flushed a little.  "I have not the slightest
curiosity

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0024" n="5"/>


about my neighbors," she said, "but it is impossible to live just across
the road from any house without knowing something of what is going on,
whether one looks or not," said she, with dignity.</p>

<p>"Ma and I never look out of the windows from curiosity," said Ethel
Glynn, with spirit.  Ethel Glynn had a great deal of spirit, which was
evinced in her personal appearance as well as her tongue.  She had an
eye to the fashions; her sleeves were never out of date, nor was the
arrangement of her hair.</p>

<p>"For instance," said Ethel, "we never look at the house opposite
because we are at all prying, but we do know that that old maid has been
doing a mighty queer thing lately."</p>

<p>"First thing you know you will be

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0025" n="6"/>


an old maid yourself, and then your stones will break your own glass
house," said Abby Simson.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't care," retorted Ethel.  "Nowadays an old maid isn't an
old maid except from choice, and everybody knows it.  But it must have
been different in Miss Eudora's time.  Why, she is older than you are,
Miss Abby."</p>

<p>"Just five years," replied Abby, unruffled, "and she had chances, and
I know it."</p>

<p>"Why didn't she take them, then?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Abby, "girls had choice then as much as now, but I
never could make out why she didn't marry Harry Lawton."</p>

<p>Ethel gave her head a toss.  "Maybe," said she, "once in a while,
even so long ago, a girl wasn't so crazy to get

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0026" n="7"/>


married as folks thought.  Maybe she didn't want him."</p>

<p>"She did want him," said Abby.  "A girl doesn't get so pale and
peaked-looking for nothing as Eudora Yates did, after she had dismissed
Harry Lawton and he had gone away, nor haunt the post-office as she used
to, and, when she didn't get a letter, go away looking as if she would
die."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Ethel, "her folks were opposed."</p>

<p>"Nobody ever opposed Eudora Yates except her own self," replied Abby.
"Her father was dead, and Eudora's ma thought the sun rose and set in
her.  She would never have opposed her if she had wanted to marry a
foreign duke or the old Harry himself."</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0027" n="8"/>

<p>"I remember it perfectly," said Mrs. Joseph Glynn.</p>

<p>"So do I," said Julia Esterbrook.</p>

<p>"Don't see why you shouldn't.  You were plenty old enough to have
your memory in good working order if it was ever going to be," said Abby
Simson.</p>

<p>"Well," said Ethel, "it is the funniest thing I ever heard of.  If
a girl wanted a man enough to go all to pieces over him, and he wanted
her, why on earth didn't she take him?"</p>

<p>"Maybe they quarreled," ventured Mrs. Edward Lee, who was a mild,
sickly-looking woman and seldom expressed an opinion.</p>

<p>"Well, that might have been," agreed Abby, "although Eudora always
had the name of having a beautiful disposition."</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0028" n="9"/>

<p>"I have always found," said Mrs.  Joseph Glynn, with an air of
wisdom, "that it is the beautiful dispositions which are the most set
the minute they get a start the wrong way.  It is the always-flying-out
people who are the easiest to get on with in the long run."</p>

<p>"Well," said Abby, "maybe that is so, but folks might get worn all to
a frazzle by the flying-out ones before the long run.  I'd rather take
my chances with a woman like Eudora.  She always seems just so, just as
calm and sweet.  When the Ames's barn, that was next to hers, burned
down and the wind was her way, she just walked in and out of her house,
carrying the things she valued most, and she looked like a picture &mdash;
somehow she had got all dressed fit to make

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0029" n="10"/>

calls &mdash; and there wasn't a muscle of her face that seemed to move.
Eudora Yates is to my mind the most beautiful woman in this town, old or
young, I don't care who she is."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Julia Esterbrook, "that she has a lot of
money."</p>

<p>"I wonder if she has," said Mrs. John Bates.</p>

<p>The others stared at her.  "What makes you think she hasn't?" Mrs.
Glynn inquired, sharply.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Mrs. Bates, and closed her thin lips.  She would say
no more, but the others had suspicions, because her husband, John
Bates, was a wealthy business man.</p>

<p>"I can't believe she has lost her money," said Mrs. Glynn.  "She
wouldn't have been such a fool as to do what she has if she hadn't
money."</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0030" n="11"/>

<p>"What has she done?" asked Mrs. Bates, eagerly.</p>

<p>"What has she done?" asked Abby, and Mrs. Lee looked up
inquiringly.</p>

<p>The faces of Mrs. Glynn, her daughter, and her sister became
important, full of sly and triumphant knowledge.</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard?" asked Mrs. Glynn.</p>

<p>"Yes, haven't you?" asked Ethel.</p>

<p>"Haven't any of you heard?" asked Julia Esterbrook.</p>

<p>"No," admitted Abby, rather feebly.  "I don't know as I have."</p>

<p>"Do you mean about Eudora's going so often to the Lancaster girls'
to tea?" asked Mrs. John Bates, with a slight bridle of possible
knowledge.</p>

<p>"I heard of that," said Mrs. Lee, not to be outdone.</p>

<p>"Land, no," replied Mrs. Glynn.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0031" n="12"/>

"Didn't she always go there?  It isn't that.  It is the most unheard-of
thing she had done; but no woman, unless she had plenty of money to
bring it up, would have done it."</p>

<p>"To bring what up?" asked Abby, sharply.  Her eyes looked as small
and bright as needles.</p>

<p>Julia regarded her with intense satisfaction.  "What do women
generally bring up?" said she.</p>

<p>"I don't know of anything they bring up, whether they have it or not,
except a baby," retorted Abby, sharply.</p>

<p>Julia wilted a little; but her sister, Mrs. Glynn, was not perturbed.
She launched her thunderbolt of news at once, aware that the critical
moment had come, when the quarry of suspicion had left the bushes.</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0032" n="13"/>

<p>"She has adopted a baby," said she, and paused like a woman who had
fired a gun, half scared herself and shrinking from the report.</p>

<p>Ethel seconded her mother.  "Yes," said she, "Miss Eudora has adopted
a baby, and she has a baby-carriage, and she wheels it out any time she
takes a notion."  Ethel's speech was of the nature of an after-climax.
The baby-carriage weakened the situation.</p>

<p>The other women seized upon the idea of the carriage to cover their
surprise and prevent too much gloating on the part of Mrs. Glynn,
Ethel, and Julia.</p>

<p>"Is it a new carriage?" inquired Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>"No, it looks like one that came over in the ark," retorted Mrs.
Glynn.</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0033" n="14"/>

<p>Then she repeated: "She has adopted a baby," but this time there was
no effect of an explosion.  However, the treble chorus rose high, "Where
did she get the baby?  Was it a boy or a girl?  Why did she adopt it?
Did it cry much?" and other queries, none of which Mrs. Glynn, Ethel,
and Julia could answer very decidedly except the last.  They all
announced that the adopted baby was never heard to cry at all.</p>

<p>"Must be a very good child," said Abby.</p>

<p>"Must be a very healthy child," said Mrs. Lee, who had had experience
with crying babies.</p>

<p>"Well, she has it, anyhow," said Mrs. Glynn.</p>

<p>Right upon the announcement came proof.  The beautiful door of the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0034" n="15"/>

old colonial mansion opposite was thrown open, and clumsy and cautious
motion was evident.  Presently a tall, slender woman came down the path
between the box borders, pushing a baby-carriage.  It was undoubtedly a
very old carriage.  It must have dated back to the fifties, if not the
forties.  It was made of wood, with a leather buggy-top, and was
evidently very heavy.</p>

<p>Abby eyed it shrewdly.  "If I am not mistaken," said she, "that is
the very carriage Eudora herself was wheeled around in when she was a
baby.  I am almost sure I have seen that identical carriage before.
When we were girls I used to go to the Yates house sometimes.  Of
course, it was always very formal, a little tea-party for Eudora, with
her mother

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0035" n="16"/>

on hand, but I feel sure that I saw that carriage there one of those
times.</p>

<p>"I suppose it cost a lot of money, in the time of it.  The Yateses
always got the very best for Eudora," said Julia.  "And maybe Eudora
goes about so little she doesn't realize how out of date the carriage
is, but I should think it would be very heavy to wheel, especially if
the baby is a good-sized one."</p>

<p>"It looks like a very large baby," said Ethel.  "Of course, it is so
rolled up we can't tell."</p>

<p>"Haven't you gone out and asked to see the baby?" said Abby.</p>

<p>"Would we dare unless Eudora Yates offered to show it?" said Julia,
with a surprised air; and the others nodded assent.  Then they all
crowded to the front windows and watched

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0036" n="17"/>

from behind the screens of green flowering things.  It was very early in
the spring.  Fairly hot days alternated with light frosts.  The trees
were touched with sprays of rose and gold and gold-green, but the wind
still blew cold from the northern snows, and the occupant of Eudora's
ancient carriage was presumably wrapped well to shelter it from harm.
There was, in fact, nothing to be seen in the carriage, except a large
roll of blue and white, as Eudora emerged from the yard and closed the
iron gate of the tall fence behind her.</p>

<p>Through this fence pricked the evergreen box, and the deep yard was
full of soft pastel tints of reluctantly budding trees and bushes.
There was one deep splash of color from a yellow bush in full bloom.</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0037" n="18"/>

<p>Eudora paced down the sidewalk with a magnificent, stately gait.
There was something rather magnificent in her whole appearance.  Her
skirts of old, but rich, black fabric swept about her long, advancing
limbs; she held her black-bonneted head high, as if crowned.  She pushed
the cumbersome baby-carriage with no apparent effort.  An ancient India
shawl was draped about her sloping shoulders.</p>

<p>Eudora, as she passed the Glynn house, turned her face slightly, so
that its pure oval was evident.  She was now a beauty in late middle
life.  Her hair, of an indeterminate shade, swept in soft shadows over
her ears; her features were regular; her expression was at once regal
and gentle.  A charm which was neither of youth

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0038" n="19"/>


nor of age reigned in her face; her grace had surmounted with triumphant
ease the slope of every year.  Eudora passed out of sight with the
baby-carriage, lifting her proud lady-head under the soft droop of the
spring boughs; and her inspectors, whom she had not seen, moved back
from the Glynn windows with exclamations of astonishment.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Abby, "whether she will have that baby call her ma
or aunty."</p>

<p>Meantime Eudora passed down the village street until she reached the
Lancaster house, about half a mile away on the same side.  There dwelt
the Misses Amelia and Anna Lancaster, who were about Eudora's age, and
a widowed sister, Mrs. Sophia Willing, who was much older.  The

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0039" n="20"/>


Lancaster house was also a colonial mansion, much after the fashion of
Eudora's, but it showed signs of continued opulence.  Eudora's, behind
her trees and leafing vines, was gray for lack of paint.  Some of the
colonial ornamental details about porches and roof were sloughing off or
had already disappeared.  The Lancaster house gleamed behind its grove
of evergreen trees as white and perfect as in its youth.  The windows
showed rich slants of draperies behind their green glister of old
glass.</p>

<p>A gardener, with a boy assistant, was at work in the grounds when
Eudora entered.  He touched his cap.  He was an old man who had lived
with the Lancasters ever since Eudora could remember.  He advanced
toward her now.  "Sha'n't Tommy

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0040" n="21"/>

push&mdash;the baby-carriage up to the house for you, Miss Eudora?" he
said, in his cracked old voice.</p>

<p>Eudora flushed slightly, and, as if in response, the old man flushed,
also.  "No, I thank you, Wilson," she said, and moved on.</p>

<p>The boy, who was raking dry leaves, stood gazing at them with a
shrewd, whimsical expression.  He was the old man's grandson.</p>

<p>"Is that a boy or a girl kid, grandpa?" he inquired, when the gardener
returned.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!" replied the old man, irascibly.  Suddenly he
seized the boy by his two thin little shoulders with knotted old
hands.</p>

<p>"Look at here, Tommy, whatever you know, you keep your mouth shet, and
whatever you don't know, you

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0041" n="22"/>

keep your mouth shet, if you know what's good for you," he said, in a
fierce whisper.</p>

<p>The boy whistled and shrugged his shoulders loose.  "You know I ain't
goin' to tell tales, grandpa," he said, in a curiously manly
fashion.</p>

<p>The old man nodded.  "All right, Tommy.  I don't believe you be,
nuther, but you may jest as well git it through your head what's goin'
to happen if you do."</p>

<p>"Ain't goin' to," returned the boy.  He whistled charmingly as he
raked the leaves.  His whistle sounded like the carol of a bird.</p>

<p>Eudora pushed the carriage around to the side door, and immediately
there was a fluttering rush of a slender woman clad in lavender down the
steps.  This woman first kissed

<pb/>


 <pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0042"/>
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0043"/>
    
<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0044" n="23"/>


Eudora with gentle fervor, then, with a sly look around and voice raised
intentionally high, she lifted the blue and white roll from the carriage
with the tenderest care.  "Did the darling come to see his aunties?" she
shrilled.</p>

<p>The old man and the boy in the front yard heard her distinctly.  The
old man's face was imperturbable.  The boy grinned.</p>

<p>Two other women, all clad in lavender, appeared in the doorway.  They
also bent over the blue and white bundle.  They also said something
about the darling coming to see his aunties.  Then there ensued the
softest chorus of lady-laughter, as if at some hidden joke.</p>

<p>"Come in, Eudora dear," said Amelia Lancaster.  "Yes, come in, Eudora
dear," said Anna Lancaster.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0045" n="24"/>

"Yes, come in, Eudora dear," said Sophia Willing.</p>

<p>Sophia looked much older than her sisters, but with that exception
the resemblance between all three was startling.  They always dressed
exactly alike, too, in silken fabric of bluish lavender, like myrtle
blossoms.  Some of the poetical souls in the village called the
Lancaster sisters "The ladies in lavender."</p>

<p>There was an astonishing change in the treatment of the blue and
white bundle when the sisters and Eudora were in the stately old
sitting-room, with its heavy mahogany furniture and its white-wainscoted
calls.  Amelia simply tossed the bundle into a corner of the sofa; then
the sisters all sat in a loving circle around Eudora.</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0046" n="25"/>

<p>"Are you sure you are not utterly worn out, dear?" asked Amelia,
tenderly; and the others repeated the question in exactly the same tone.
The Lancaster sisters were not pretty, but all had charming expressions
of gentleness and a dignified good-will and loving kindness.  Their blue
eyes beamed love at Eudora, and it was as if she sat encircled in a
soul-ring of affection.</p>

<p>She responded, and her beautiful face glowed with tenderness and
pleasure, and something besides, which was as the light of victory.</p>

<p>"I am not in the least tired, thank you, dears," she replied.  "Why
should I be tired?  I am very strong."</p>

<p>Amelia murmured something about such hard work.</p>

<p>"I never thought it would be hard

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0047" n="26"/>

work taking care of a baby," replied Eudora, "and especially such a very
light baby."</p>

<p>Something whimsical crept into Eudora's voice; something whimsical
crept into the love-light of the other women's eyes.  Again a soft
ripple of mirth swept over them.</p>

<p>"Especially a baby who never cries," said Amelia.</p>

<p>"No, he never does cry," said Eudora, demurely.</p>

<p>They laughed again.  Then Amelia rose and left the room to get the
tea-things.  The old serving-woman who had lived with them for many
years was suffering from rheumatism, and was cared for by her daughter
in the little cottage across the road from the Lancaster house.  Her
husband and grandson were the man and

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0048" n="27"/>

boy at work in the grounds.  The three sisters took care of themselves
and their house with the elegant ease and lack of fluster of gentlewomen
born and bred.  Miss Amelia, bringing in the tea-tray, was an unclassed
being, neither maid nor mistress, but outranking either.  She had tied
on a white apron.  She bore the silver tray with an ease which bespoke
either nerve or muscle in her lace-draped arms.</p>

<p>She poured the tea, holding the silver pot high and letting the amber
fluid trickle slowly, and the pearls and diamonds on her thin hands
shone dully.  Sophia passed little china plates and fringed napkins, and
Anna a silver basket with golden squares of sponge-cake.</p>

<p>The ladies ate and drank, and the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0049" n="28"/>

blue and white bundle on the sofa remained motionless.  Eudora, after
she had finished her tea, leaned back gracefully in her chair, and her
dark eyes gleamed with its mild stimulus.  She remained an hour or more.
When she went out, Amelia slipped an envelope into her hand and at the
same time embraced and kissed her.  Sophia and Anna followed her
example.  Eudora opened her mouth as if to speak, but smiled instead, a
fond, proud smile.  During the last fifteen minutes of her stay Amelia
had slipped out of the room with the blue and white bundle.  Now she
brought it out and laid it carefully in the carriage.</p>

<p>"We are always so glad to see you, dearest Eudora," said she, "but
you understand &mdash;"</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0050" n="29"/>

<p>"Yes," said Sophia, "you understand, Eudora dear, that there is not
the slightest haste."</p>

<p>Eudora nodded, and her long neck seemed to grow longer.</p>

<p>When she was stepping regally down the path, Amelia said in a hasty
whisper to Sophia: "Did you tell her?"</p>

<p>Sophia shook her head.  "No, sister."</p>

<p>"I didn't know but you might have, while I was out of the room."</p>

<p>"I did not," said Sophia.  She looked doubtfully at Amelia, then at
Anna, and doubt flashed back and forth between the three pairs of blue
eyes for a second.  Then Sophia spoke with authority, because she was
the only one of them all who had entered the estate of matrimony, and
had consequently obvious cognizance of such matters.</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0051" n="30"/>

<p>"I think," said she, "that Eudora should be told that Harry Lawton
has come back and is boarding at the Wellwood Inn."</p>

<p>"You think," faltered Amelia, "that it is possible she might meet him
unexpectedly?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do think so.  And she might show her feelings in a way
which she would ever afterward regret."</p>

<p>"You think, then, that she &mdash;"</p>

<p>Sophia gave her sister a look.  Amelia fled after Eudora and the
baby-carriage.  She overtook her at the gate.  She laid her hand on
Eudora's arm, draped with India shawl.</p>

<p>"Eudora!" she gasped.</p>

<p>Eudora turned her serene face and regarded her questioningly.</p>

<p>"Eudora," said Amelia, "have you

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0052" n="31"/>


heard of anybody's coming to stay at the inn lately?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Eudora, calmly.  "Why, dear?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, only, Eudora, a dear and old friend of yours, of ours, is
there, so I hear."</p>

<p>Eudora did not inquire who the old friend might be.  "Really?" she
remarked.  Then she said, "Good-by, Amelia dear," and resumed her
progress with the baby-carriage.</p>

<p>"SHE never even asked who it was," Amelia reported to her sisters,
when she had returned to the house.  "Because she knew," replied Sophia,
sagely; "there has never been any old friend but that one old friend to
come back into Eudora Yates's life."</p>

<p>"Has he come back into her life, I wonder?" said Amelia.</p>

<p>"What did he return to Wellwood for if he didn't come for that?  All
his relatives are gone.  He never married.  Yes, he has come back to see
Eudora and marry her, if she will have him.  No man who ever loved
Eudora would ever get over loving

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0057" n="36"/>

her.  And he will not be shocked when he sees her.  She is no more
changed than a beautiful old statue."</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">"He</hi> is changed, though," said Amelia.  "I saw him the other
day.  He didn't see me, and I would hardly have known him.  He has grown
stout, and his hair is gray."</p>

<p>"Eudora's hair is gray," said Sophia.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you can see the gold through Eudora's gray.  It just looks
as if a shadow was thrown over it.  It doesn't change her.  Harry
Lawton's gray hair does change him."</p>

<p>"If," said Anna, sentimentally, "Eudora thinks Harry's hair turned
gray for love of her, you can trust her or any woman to see the gold
through it."</p>

<p>"Harry's hair was never gold &mdash; just an ordinary brown," said Amelia.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0058" n="37"/>


"Anyway, the Lawtons turned gray young."</p>

<p>"She won't think of that at all," said Sophia.</p>

<p>"I wonder why Eudora always avoided him so, years ago," said
Amelia.</p>

<p>"Why doesn't a girl in a field of daisies stop to pick one, which she
never forgets?" said Sophia.  "Eudora had so many chances, and I don't
think her heart was fixed when she was very young; at least, I don't
think it was fixed so she knew it."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Amelia, "if he will go and call on her."</p>

<p>Amelia privately wished that she lived near enough to know if Harry
Lawton did call.  She, as well as Mrs. Joseph Glynn, would have enjoyed
watching out and knowing something

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0059" n="38"/>

of the village happenings, but the Lancaster house was situated so far
from the road, behind its grove of trees, that nothing whatever could be
seen.</p>

<p>"I doubt if Eudora tells, if he does call&mdash;that is, not unless
something definite happens," said Anna.</p>

<p>"No," remarked Amelia, sadly.  "Eudora is a dear, but she is very
silent with regard to her own affairs."</p>

<p>"She ought to be," said Sophia, with her married authority.  She was,
to her sisters, as one who had passed within the shrine and was
dignifiedly silent with regard to its intimate mysteries.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," assented Anna, with a soft sigh.  Amelia sighed also.
Then she took the tea-tray out of the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0060" n="39"/>

room.  She had to make some biscuits for supper.</p>

<p>Meantime Eudora was pacing homeward with the baby-carriage.  Her
serene face was a little perturbed.  Her oval cheeks were flushed, and
her mouth now and then trembled.  She had, if she followed her usual
course, to pass the Wellwood Inn, but she could diverge, and by taking a
side street and walking a half-mile farther reach home without coming in
sight of the inn.  She did so to-day.</p>

<p>When she reached the side street she turned rather swiftly and gave a
little sigh of relief.  She was afraid that she might meet Harry Lawton.
It was a lonely way.  There was a brook on one side, bordered thickly
with bushy willows which were turning gold-green.  On the other side

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0061" n="40"/>

were undulating pasture-lands on which grazed a few sheep.  There were
no houses until she reached the turn which would lead back to the main
street, on which her home was located.</p>

<p>Eudora was about midway of this street when she saw a man
approaching.  He was a large man clad in gray, and he was swinging an
umbrella.  Somehow the swing of that umbrella, even from a distance,
gave an impression of embarrassment and boyish hesitation.  Eudora did
not know him at first.  She had expected to see the same Harry Lawton
who had gone away.  She did not expect to see a stout, middle-aged man,
but a slim youth.</p>

<p>However, as they drew nearer each other, she knew; and curiously
enough

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0062" n="41"/>

it was that swing of the tightly furled umbrella which gave her the
clue.  She knew Harry because of that.  It was a little boyish trick
which had survived time.  It was too late for her to draw back, for he
had seen her, and Eudora was keenly alive to the indignity of abruptly
turning and scuttling away with the tail of her black silk swishing, her
India shawl trailing, and the baby-carriage bumping over the furrows.
She continued, and Harry Lawton continued, and they met.</p>

<p>Harry Lawton had known Eudora at once.  She looked the same to him as
when she had been a girl, and he looked the same to her when he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Eudora," said Harry Lawton, in a ludicrously boyish
fashion.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0063" n="42"/>

His face flushed, too, like a boy.  He extended his hand like a boy.
The man, seen near at hand, was a boy.  In reality he himself had not
changed.  A few layers of flesh and a change of color-cells do not make
another man.  He had always been a simple, sincere, friendly soul,
beloved of men and women alike, and he was that now.  Eudora held out
her hand, and her eyes fell before the eyes of the man, in an absurd
fashion for such a stately creature as she.  But the man himself acted
like a great happy overgrown school-boy.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Eudora," he said again.</p>

<p>"Hullo," said she, falteringly.</p>

<p>It was inconceivable that they should meet in such wise after the
years of separation and longing which they had both undergone; but each

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0064" n="43"/>

took refuge, as it were, in a long-past youth, even childhood, from the
fierce tension of age.  When they were both children they had been
accustomed to pass each other on the village street with exactly
such salutation, and now both reverted to it.  The tall, regal woman
in her India shawl and the stout, middle-aged man had both stepped back
to their vantage-ground of springtime to meet.</p>

<p>However, after a moment, Eudora reasserted herself.  "I only heard a
short time ago that you were here," she said, in her usual even voice.
The fair oval of her face was as serene and proud toward the man as the
face of the moon.</p>

<p>The man swung his umbrella, then began prodding the ground with it.
"Hullo, Eudora," he said again; then

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0065" n="44"/>

he added: "How are you, anyway?  Fine and well?"</p>

<p>"I am very well, thank you," said Eudora.  "So you have come home to
Wellwood after all this time?"</p>

<p>The man made an effort and recovered himself, although his handsome
face was burning.</p>

<p>"Yes," he remarked, with considerable ease and dignity, to which he
had a right, for Harry Lawton had not made a failure of his life, even
though it had not included Eudora and a fulfilled dream.</p>

<p>"Yes," he continued, "I had some leisure; in fact, I have this spring
retired from business; and I thought I would have a look at the old
place.  Very little changed I am happy to find it."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is very little changed,"

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0066" n="45"/>

assented Eudora; "at least, it seems so to me, but it is not for a
life-long dweller in any place to judge of change.  It is for the one
who goes and returns after many years."</p>

<p>There was a faint hint of proud sadness in Eudora's voice as she
spoke the last two words.</p>

<p>"It has been many years," said Lawton, gravely, "and I wonder if it
has seemed so to you."</p>

<p>Eudora held her head proudly.  "Time passes swiftly," said she,
tritely.</p>

<p>"But sometimes it may seem long in the passing, however swift," said
Lawton, "though I suppose it has not to you.  You look just the same,"
he added, regarding her admiringly.</p>

<p>Eudora flushed a little.  "I must be changed," she murmured.</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0067" n="46"/>

<p>"Not a bit.  I would have known you anywhere.  But I &mdash;"</p>

<p>"I knew you the minute you spoke."</p>

<p>"Did you?" he asked, eagerly.  "I was afraid I had grown so stout you
would not remember me at all.  Queer how a man will grow stout.  I am
not such a big eater, either, and I have worked hard, and &mdash; well, I
might have been worse off, but I must say I have seen men who seemed to
me happier, though I have made the best of things.  I always did despise
a flunk.  But you!  I heard you had adopted a baby," he said, with a
sudden glance at the blue and white bundle in the carriage, "and I
thought you were mighty sensible.  When people grow old they want young
people growing around them, staffs for old

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0068" n="47"/>

age, you know, and all that sort of thing.  Don't know but I should have
adopted a boy myself if it hadn't been for &mdash;"</p>

<p>The man stopped, and his face was pink.  Eudora turned her face
slightly away.</p>

<p>"By the way," said the man, in a suddenly hushed voice, "I suppose
the kid you've got there is asleep.  Wouldn't do to wake him?"</p>

<p>"I think I had better not," replied Eudora, in a hesitating voice.
She began to walk along, and Harry Lawton fell into step beside her.</p>

<p>"I suppose it isn't best to wake up babies; makes them cross, and
they cry," he said.  "Say, Eudora, is he much trouble?"</p>

<p>"Very little," replied Eudora, still in that strange voice.</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0069" n="48"/>

<p>"Doesn't keep you awake nights?"</p>

<p>"Oh no."</p>

<p>"Because if he does, I really think you should have a nurse.  I don't
think you ought to lose sleep taking care of him."</p>

<p>"I do not."</p>

<p>"Well, I was mighty glad when I heard you had adopted him.  I suppose
you made sure about his parentage, where he hailed from and what sort
of people?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes."  Eudora was very pale.</p>

<p>"That's right.  Maybe some time you will tell me all about it.  I am
coming over Thursday to have a look at the youngster.  I have to go to
the city on business to-morrow and can't get back until Thursday.  I was
coming over to-night to call on you, but I have a man coming to the
inn this

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0070" n="49"/>

evening &mdash; he called me up on the telephone just now &mdash; one of the men
who have taken my place in the business; and as long as I have met you I
will just walk along with you, and come Thursday.  I suppose the baby
won't be likely to wake up just yet, and when he does you'll have to get
his supper and put him to bed.  Is that the way the rule goes?"</p>

<p>Eudora nodded in a shamed, speechless sort of way.</p>

<p>"All right.  I'll come Thursday &mdash; but say, look here, Eudora.  This
is a quiet road, not a soul in sight, just like an outdoor room to
ourselves.  Why shouldn't I know now just as well as wait?  Say, Eudora,
you know how I used to feel about you.  Well, it has lasted all these
years.  There has never been another woman I even

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0071" n="50"/>

cared to look at.  You are alone, except for that baby, and I am alone.
Eudora &mdash;"</p>

<p>The man hesitated.  His flushed face had paled.  Eudora paced
silently and waveringly at his side.</p>

<p>"Eudora," the man went on, "you know you always used to run away from
me &mdash; never gave me a chance to really ask; and I thought you didn't
care.  But somehow I have wondered &mdash; perhaps because you never got
married &mdash; if you didn't quite mean it, if you didn't quite know your
own mind.  You'll think I'm a conceited ass, but I'm not a bad sort,
Eudora.  I would be as good to you as I know how, and &mdash; we could bring
him up together."  He pointed to the carriage.  "I have plenty of
money.  We could do anything we wanted to do for him,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0072" n="51"/>

and we should not have to live alone.  Say, Eudora, you may not think
it's the thing for a man to own up to, but, hang it all! I'm alone, and
I don't want to face the rest of my life alone.  Eudora, do you think
you could make up your mind to marry me, after all?"</p>

<p>They had reached the turn in the road.  Just beyond rose the stately
pile of the old Yates mansion.  Eudora stood still and gave one
desperate look at her lover.  "I will let you know Thursday," she
gasped.  Then she was gone, trundling the baby-carriage with incredible
speed.</p>

<p>"But, Eudora &mdash;"</p>

<p>"I must go," she called back, faintly.  The man stood staring after
the hurrying figure with its swishing black skirts and its flying
points of rich

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0073" n="52"/>

India shawl, and he smiled happily and tenderly.  That evening at the
inn his caller, a young fellow just married and beaming with happiness,
saw an answering beam in the older man's face.  He broke off in the
midst of a sentence and stared at him.</p>

<p>"Don't give me away until I tell you to, Ned," he said, "but I don't
know but I am going to follow your example."</p>

<p>"My example?"</p>

<p>"Yes, going to get married."</p>

<p>The young man gasped.  A look of surprise, of amusement, then of
generous sympathy came over his face.  He grasped Lawton's hand.</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a woman I wanted more than anything in the world when I was
about your age."</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0074" n="53"/>

<p>"Then she isn't young?"</p>

<p>"She is better than young."</p>

<p>"Well," agreed the young man, "being young and pretty is not
everything."</p>

<p>"Pretty!" said Harry Lawton, scornfully, "pretty!  She is a great
beauty."</p>

<p>"And not young?"</p>

<p>"She is a great beauty, and better than young, because time has not
touched her beauty, and you can see for yourself that it lasts."</p>

<p>The young man laughed.  "Oh, well," he said, with a tender
inflection, "I dare say that my Amy will look like that to me."</p>

<p>"If she doesn't you don't love her," said Lawton.  "But my Eudora
<hi rend="italic">is</hi> that."</p>

<p>"That is a queer-sounding Greek name."</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0075" n="54"/>

<p>"She is Greek, like her name.  Such beauty never grows old.  She
stands on her pedestal, and time only looks at her to love her."</p>

<p>"I thought you were a business man as hard as nails," said the young
man, wonderingly.  Lawton laughed.</p>

<p>When Thursday came, Lawton, carefully dressed and carrying a long
tissue-paper package, evidently of roses, approached the Yates house.
It was late in the afternoon.  There had been a warm day, and the trees
were clouds of green and more bushes had blossomed.  Eudora had put on a
green silk dress of her youth.  The revolving fashions had made it very
passable, and the fabric was as beautiful as ever.</p>

<p>When Lawton presented her with the roses she pinned one in the
yellowed

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0076" n="55"/>

lace which draped her bodice and put the rest in a great china vase on
the table.  The roses were very fragrant, and immediately the whole room
was possessed by them.</p>

<p>A tiny, insistent cry came from a corner, and Lawton and Eudora
turned toward it.  There stood the old wooden cradle in which Eudora had
been rocked to sleep, but over the clumsy hood Eudora had tacked a fall
of rich old lace and a great bow of soft pink satin.</p>

<p>"He is waking up," said the man, in a hushed, almost reverent
voice.</p>

<p>Eudora nodded.  She went toward the cradle, and the man followed.
She lifted the curtain of lace, and there became visible little feebly
waving pink arms and hands, like tentacles of love, and a little
puckered

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0077" n="56"/>

pink face which was at once ugly and divinely beautiful.</p>

<p>"A fine boy," said the man.  The baby made a grimace at him which was
hideous but lovely.</p>

<p>"I do believe he thinks he knows you," said Eudora, foolishly.</p>

<p>The baby made a little nestling motion, and its creasy eyelids
dropped.</p>

<p>"Looks to me as if he was going to sleep again," said Lawton, in a
whisper.  Eudora jogged the cradle gently with her foot, and both were
still.  Then Eudora dropped the lace veil over the cradle again and
moved softly away.</p>

<p>Lawton followed her.  "I haven't my answer yet, Eudora," he whis-pered, leaning over her shoulder as she moved.</p>

<p>"Come into the other room," she

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0078"/>
<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0079"/>


<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0080" n="57"/>

murmured, "or we shall wake the baby."  Her voice was softly
excited.</p>

<p>Eudora led the way into the parlor, upon whose walls hung some really
good portraits and whose furnishings still merited the adjective
magnificent.  There had been opulence in the Yates family; and in this
room, which had been conserved, there was still undimmed and unfaded
evidence of it.  Eudora drew aside a brocade curtain and sat down on an
embroidered satin sofa.  Lawton sat beside her.</p>

<p>"This room looks every whit as grand as it used to look to me when I
was a boy," he said.</p>

<p>"It has hardly been opened, except to have it cleaned, since you
went away," replied Eudora, "and no wear has come upon it."</p>

<p>"And everything was rather splendid

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0081" n="58"/>

to begin with, and has lasted.  And so were you, Eudora, and you have
lasted.  Well, what about my answer, dear girl?"</p>

<p>"You have to hear something first."</p>

<p>Lawton laughed.  "A confession?"</p>

<p>Eudora held her head proudly.  "No, not exactly," said she.  "I am
not sure that I have ever had anything to confess."</p>

<p>"You never were sure, you proud creature."</p>

<p>"I am not now.  I never intended to deceive you, but you were
deceived.  I did intend to deceive others, others who had no right to
know.  I do not feel that I owe them any explanation.  I do owe you one,
although I do not feel that I have done anything wrong.  Still, I cannot
allow you to remain deceived."</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0082" n="59"/>

<p>"Well, what is it, dear?"</p>

<p>Eudora looked at him.  "You remember that afternoon when you met me
with the baby-carriage?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should think so.  My memory has not failed me in three
days."</p>

<p>"You thought I had a baby in that carriage."</p>

<p>"Of course I did."</p>

<p>"There wasn't a baby in the carriage."</p>

<p>"Well, what on earth was it, then?  A cat?"</p>

<p>Eudora, if possible, looked prouder.  "It was a package of soiled
linen from the Lancaster girls."</p>

<p>"Oh, good heavens, Eudora!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Eudora, proudly.  "I lost nearly everything when that
railroad failed.  I had enough left

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0083" n="60"/>

to pay the taxes, and that was all.  After I had used a small sum in the
savings-bank there was nothing.  One day I went over to the Lancasters',
and I &mdash; well, I had not had much to eat for several days.  I was a
little faint, and &mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eudora, you poor, darling girl!"</p>

<p>"And the Lancaster girls found out," continued Eudora, calmly.  "They
gave me something to eat, and I suppose I ate as if I were famished.  I
was."</p>

<p>"Eudora!"</p>

<p>"And they wanted to give me money, but I would not take it, and they
had been trying to find a laundress for their finer linen &mdash; their old
serving-woman was ill.  They could find one for the heavier things, but
they are very particular, and I was

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0084" n="61"/>

sure I could manage, and so I begged them to let me have the work, and
they did, and overpaid me, I fear.  And I &mdash; I knew very well how many
spying eyes were about, and I thought of my proud father and my proud
mother and grandmother, and perhaps I was proud, too.  You know they
talk about the Yates pride.  It was not so much because I was ashamed of
doing honest work as because I did resent those prying eyes and tattling
tongues, and so I said nothing, but I did go back and forth in broad
daylight with the linen wrapped up in the old blue and white blanket, in
my old carriage, and they thought what they thought."</p>

<p>Eudora laughed faintly.  She had a gentle humor.  "It was somewhat
laughable, too," she observed.  "The

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0085" n="62"/>

Lancaster girls and I have had our little jests over it, but I felt that
I could not deceive you."</p>

<p>Lawton looked bewildered.  "But that is a real baby in there," he
said, jerking an elbow toward the other room.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," replied Eudora.  "I adopted him yesterday.  I went to the
Children's Home in Elmfield.  Amelia Lancaster went with me.  Wilson
drove us over.  I know a nurse there.  She took care of mother in her
last illness.  And I adopted this baby; at least, I am going to.  He
comes of respectable people, and his parents are dead.  His mother died
when he was born.  He is healthy, and I thought him a beautiful
baby."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is," assented Lawton, but he still looked somewhat
perplexed.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0086" n="63"/>

"But why did you hurry off so and get him, Eudora?" said he.</p>

<p>"I thought from what you said that day that you would be disappointed
when you found out I had only the Lancaster linen and not a real baby,"
said Eudora with her calm, grand air and with no trace of a smile.</p>

<p>"Then that means that you say yes, Eudora?"</p>

<p>For the first time Eudora gave a startled glance at him.  "Didn't you
know?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"How should I?  You had not said yes really, dear."</p>

<p>"Do you think," said Eudora Yates, "that I am not too proud to allow
you to ask me if my answer were not yes?"</p>

<p>"So that is the reason you always

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0087" n="64"/>

ran away from me, years ago, so that I never had a chance to ask
you?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Eudora.  "No woman of my family ever allows a
declaration which she does not intend to accept.  I was always taught
that by my mother."</p>

<p>Then a small but insistent cry rent the air.  "The baby is awake!"
cried Eudora, and ran, or, rather, paced swiftly &mdash; Eudora had been
taught never to run &mdash; and Lawton followed.  It was he who finally
quieted the child, holding the little thing in his arms.</p>

<p>But the baby, before that, cried so long and lustily that all the
women in the Glynn house opposite were on the alert, and also some of
the friends who were calling there.  Abby Simson was one.</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002081_0088" n="65"/>

<p>"Harry Lawton has been there over an hour now," said Abby, while the
wailing continued, "and I know as well as I want to that there will be a
wedding."</p>

<p>"I wonder he doesn't object to that adopted baby," said Julia
Esterbrook.</p>

<p>"I know one thing," said Abby Simson.  "It must be a boy baby, it
hollers so."</p>

<p>THE END</p>
