                    <p>The electronic text was scanned from Scribner's third edition (1894) and was
                        verified against a 1892 first edition. The two editions appear to be
                        identical except for the advertisment and the titlepage; images of these
                        pages have been taken from the 1892 edition and included in the
                    frontmatter.</p>

                    <head> I.<lb/> THE ORIGIN OF THE WAR </head>

                    <p>A DEADLY feud was raging among the boys of Numedale. The East-Siders hated
                        the West-Siders, and thrashed them when they got a chance; and the
                        West-Siders, when fortune favored them, returned the compliment with
                        interest. It required considerable courage for a boy to venture, unattended
                        by comrades, into the territory of the enemy; and no one took the risk
                        unless dire necessity compelled him. </p>
                    <p>The hostile parties had played at war so long that they had forgotten that it
                        was play; and now were actually inspired with the emotions which they had
                        formerly simulated. Under the leadership of their chieftains, Halvor Reitan
                        and Viggo H&ouml;&ouml;k, they held councils of war, sent out
                        scouts, planned midnight surprises, and fought at times mimic battles. I say
                        mimic battles, because no one was ever killed; but broken heads and bruised
                        limbs many a one carried home from these engagements. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0027" n="2"/> and
                        unhappily one boy, named Peer Oestmo, had an eye put out by an arrow. </p>
                    <p>It was a great consolation to him that he became a hero to all the
                        West-Siders and was promoted for bravery in the field to the rank of first
                        lieutenant. He had the sympathy of all his companions in arms and got
                        innumerable bites of apples, cancelled postage stamps, and colored
                        advertising-labels in token of their esteem. </p>
                    <p>But the principal effect of this first serious wound was to invest the war
                        with a breathless and all-absorbing interest. It was now no longer "make
                        believe," but deadly earnest. Blood had flowed; insults had been exchanged
                        in due order, and offended honor cried for vengeance. </p>
                    <p>It was fortunate that the river divided the West-Siders from the East-Siders,
                        or it would have been difficult to tell what might have happened. Viggo
                        H&ouml;&ouml;k, the West-Side general, was a handsome, high-spirited
                        lad of fifteen, who was the last person to pocket an injury, as long as red
                        blood flowed in his veins, as he was wont to express it. He was the eldest
                        son of Colonel H&ouml;&ouml;k of the regular army, and meant some
                        day to be a Von Moltke or a Napoleon. He felt in his heart that he was
                        destined for something great; and in conformity with this conviction assumed
                        a superb behavior, which his comrades found very admirable. </p>
                    <p>He had the gift of leadership in a marked degree, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002438_0028" n="3"/> and established
                        his authority by a due mixture of kindness and severity. Those boys whom he
                        honored with his confidence were absolutely attached to him. Those whom,
                        with magnificent arbitrariness, he punished and persecuted, felt meekly that
                        they had probably deserved it; and if they had not, it was somehow in the
                        game. </p>
                    <p>There never was a more absolute king than Viggo, nor one more abjectly
                        courted and admired. And the amusing part of it was that he was at heart a
                        generous and good-natured lad, but possessed with a lofty ideal of heroism,
                        which required above all things that whatever he said or did must be
                        striking. He dramatized, as it were, every phrase he uttered and every act
                        he performed, and modelled himself alternately after Napoleon and
                        Wellington, as he had seen them represented in the old engravings which
                        decorated the walls in his father's study. </p>
                    <p>He had read much about heroes of war, ancient and modern, and he lived about
                        half his own life imagining himself by turns all sorts of grand characters
                        from history or fiction. </p>
                    <p>His costume was usually in keeping with his own conception of these
                        characters, in so far as his scanty opportunities permitted. An old, broken
                        sword of his father's, which had been polished until it "flashed" properly,
                        was girded to a brass-mounted belt about his waist; an ancient,
                        gold-braided, <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0029" n="4"/> military cap, which was much too large, covered
                        his curly head; and four tarnished brass buttons, displaying the Golden Lion
                        of Norway, gave a martial air to his blue jacket, although the rest were
                        plain horn. </p>
                    <p>But quite independently of his poor trappings Viggo was to his comrades an
                        august personage. I doubt if the Grand Vizier feels more flattered and
                        gratified by the favor of the Sultan than little Marcus Henning did, when
                        Viggo condescended to be civil to him. </p>
                    <p>Marcus was small, round-shouldered, spindle-shanked, and freckle-faced. His
                        hair was coarse, straight, and the color of maple sirup; his nose was broad
                        and a little flattened at the point, and his clothes had a knack of never
                        fitting him. They were made to grow in and somehow he never caught up with
                        them, he once said, with no intention of being funny. His father, who was
                        Colonel H&ouml;&ouml;k's nearest neighbor, kept a modest country
                        shop, in which you could buy anything, from dry goods and groceries to shoes
                        and medicines. You would have to be very ingenious to ask for a thing which
                        Henning could not supply. The smell in the store carried out the same idea;
                        for it was a mixture of all imaginable smells under the sun. </p>
                    <p>Now, it was the chief misery of Marcus that, sleeping, as he did, in the room
                        behind the store, he had become so impregnated with this curious composite
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0030" n="5"/> smell that it followed him like an odoriferous halo, and
                        procured him a number of unpleasant nicknames. The principal ingredient was
                        salted herring; but there was also a suspicion of tarred ropes, plug
                        tobacco, prunes, dried codfish, and oiled tarpaulin. </p>
                    <p>It was not so much kindness of heart as respect for his own dignity which
                        made Viggo refrain from calling Marcus a "Muskrat" or a "Smelling-Bottle."
                        And yet Marcus regarded this gracious forbearance on his part as the mark of
                        a noble soul. He had been compelled to accept these offensive nicknames,
                        and, finding rebellion vain, he had finally acquiesced in them. </p>
                    <p>He never loved to be called a "Muskrat," though he answered to the name
                        mechanically. But when Viggo addressed him as "base minion," in his wrath,
                        or as "Sergeant Henning," in his sunnier moods, Marcus felt equally
                        complimented by both terms, and vowed in his grateful soul eternal
                        allegiance and loyalty to his chief. He bore kicks and cuffs with the same
                        admirable equanimity; never complained when he was thrown into a dungeon in
                        a deserted pigsty for breaches of discipline of which he was entirely
                        guiltless, and trudged uncomplainingly through rain and sleet and snow, as
                        scout or spy, or what-not, at the behest of his exacting commander. </p>
                    <p>It was all so very real to him that he never would have thought of doubting
                        the importance of <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0031" n="6"/> his mission. He was rather honored by the
                        trust reposed in him, and was only intent upon earning a look or word of
                        scant approval from the superb personage whom he worshipped. </p>
                    <p>Halvor Reitan, the chief of the East-Siders, was a big, burly peasant lad,
                        with a pimpled face, fierce blue eyes, and a shock of towy hair. But he had
                        muscles as hard as twisted ropes, and sinews like steel. </p>
                    <p>He had the reputation, of which he was very proud, of being the strongest boy
                        in the valley, and though he was scarcely sixteen years old, he boasted that
                        he could whip many a one of twice his years. He had, in fact, been so
                        praised for his strength that he never neglected to accept, or even to
                        create, opportunities for displaying it. </p>
                    <p>His manner was that of a bully; but it was vanity and not malice which made
                        him always spoil for a fight. He and Viggo H&ouml;&ouml;k had
                        attended the parson's "Confirmation Class," together, and it was there their
                        hostility had commenced. </p>
                    <p>Halvor, who conceived a dislike of the tall, rather dainty, and disdainful
                        Viggo, with his aquiline nose and clear, aristocratic features, determined,
                        as he expressed it, to take him down a peg or two; and the more his
                        challenges were ignored the more persistent he grew in his insults. </p>
                    <p>He dubbed Viggo "Missy." He ran against him with such violence in the hall
                        that he knocked his head against the wainscoting; he tripped him <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0032" n="7"/>
                        up on the stairs by means of canes and sticks; and he hired his partisans
                        who sat behind Viggo to stick pins into him, while he recited his lessons.
                        And when all these provocations proved unavailing he determined to dispense
                        with any pretext, but simply thrash his enemy within an inch of his life at
                        the first opportunity which presented itself. He grew to hate Viggo and was
                        always aching to molest him. </p>
                    <p>Halvor saw plainly enough that Viggo despised him, and refused to notice his
                        challenges, not so much because he was afraid of him, as because he regarded
                        himself as a superior being who could afford to ignore insults from an
                        inferior, without loss of dignity. </p>
                    <p>During recess the so-called "genteel boys," who had better clothes and better
                        manners than the peasant lads, separated themselves from the rest, and
                        conversed or played with each other. No one will wonder that such behavior
                        was exasperating to the poorer boys. I am far from defending Viggo's
                        behavior in this instance. He was here, as everywhere, the acknowledged
                        leader; and therefore more cordially hated than the rest. It was the
                        Roundhead hating the Cavalier; and the Cavalier making merry at the expense
                        of the Roundhead. </p>
                    <p>There was only one boy in the Confirmation Class who was doubtful as to what
                        camp should claim him, and that was little Marcus Henning. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0033" n="8"/> He
                        was a kind of amphibious animal who, as he thought, really belonged nowhere.
                        His father was of peasant origin, but by his prosperity and his occupation
                        had risen out of the class to which he was formerly attached, without yet
                        rising into the ranks of the gentry, who now, as always, looked with scorn
                        upon interlopers. Thus it came to pass that little Marcus, whose
                        inclinations drew him toward Viggo's party, was yet forced to associate with
                        the partisans of Halvor Reitan. </p>
                    <p>It was not a vulgar ambition "to pretend to be better than he was" which
                        inspired Marcus with a desire to change his allegiance, but a deep,
                        unreasoning admiration for Viggo H&ouml;&ouml;k. He had never seen
                        any one who united so many superb qualities, nor one who looked every inch
                        as noble as he did. </p>
                    <p>It did not discourage him in the least that his first approaches met with no
                        cordial reception. His offer to communicate to Viggo where there was a
                        hawk's nest was coolly declined, and even the attractions of fox dens and
                        rabbits' burrows were valiantly resisted. Better luck he had with a pair of
                        fan-tail pigeons, his most precious treasure, which Viggo rather loftily
                        consented to accept, for, like most genteel boys in the valley, he was an
                        ardent pigeon-fancier, and had long vainly importuned his father to procure
                        him some of the rarer breeds </p>
                    <p>He condescended to acknowledge Marcus's greeting after that, and to respond
                        to his diffident "Good-morning" <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0034" n="9"/> and "Good-evening," and Marcus
                        was duly grateful for such favors. He continued to woo his idol with raisins
                        and ginger-snaps from the store, and other delicate attentions, and bore the
                        snubs which often fell to his lot with humility and patience. </p>
                    <p>But an event soon occurred which was destined to change the relations of the
                        two boys. Halvor Reitan called a secret meeting of his partisans, among whom
                        he made the mistake to include Marcus, and agreed with them to lie in ambush
                        at the bend of the road, where it entered the forest, and attack Viggo
                        H&ouml;&ouml;k and his followers. Then, he observed, he would "make
                        him dance a jig that would take the starch out of him." </p>
                    <p>The others declared that this would be capital fun, and enthusiastically
                        promised their assistance. Each one selected his particular antipathy to
                        thrash, though all showed a marked preference for Viggo, whom, however, for
                        reason of politeness, they were obliged to leave to the chief. Only one boy
                        sat silent, and made no offer to thrash anybody, and that was Marcus
                        Henning. </p>
                    <p>"Well, Muskrat," cried Halvor Reitan, "whom are you going to take on your
                        conscience?" </p>
                    <p>"No one," said Marcus. </p>
                    <p>"Put the Muskrat in your pocket, Halvor," suggested one of the boys; "be is
                        so small, and he has got such a hard bullet head, you might use him as a
                        club." <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0035" n="10"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Well, one thing is sure," shouted Halvor, as a dark suspicion shot through
                        his brain, "if you don't keep mum, you will be a mighty sick coon the day
                        after to-morrow." </p>
                    <p>Marcus made no reply, but got up quietly, pulled a rubber sling from his
                        pocket, and began, with the most indifferent manner in the world, to shoot
                        stones down the river. He managed during this exercise, which everybody
                        found perfectly natural, to get out of the crowd, and, without seeming to
                        have any purpose whatever, he continued to put a couple of hundred yards
                        between himself and his companion. </p>
                    <p>"Look a-here, Muskrat," he heard Halvor cry, "you promised to keep mum." </p>
                    <p>Marcus, instead of answering, took to his heels and ran. </p>
                    <p>"Boys, the scoundrel is going to betray us!" screamed the chief. "Now come,
                        boys! We've got to catch him, dead or alive." </p>
                    <p>A volley of stones, big and little, was hurled after the fugitive, who now
                        realizing his position ran for dear life. The stones hailed down round about
                        him; occasionally one vicious missile would whiz past his ear, and send a
                        cold shudder through him. The tramp of his pursuers sounded nearer and
                        nearer, and his one chance of escape was to throw himself into the only
                        boat, which he saw on this side of the river, and push out into the stream
                        before he was overtaken.</p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0036"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0037"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0038" n="11"/>
                    <p>He had his doubts as to whether he could accomplish this, for the blood
                        rushed and roared in his ears, the hill-side billowed under his feet, and it
                        seemed as if the trees were all running a race in the opposite direction, in
                        order to betray him to his enemies. </p>
                    <p>A stone gave him a thump in the back, but though he felt a gradual heat
                        spreading from the spot which it hit, he was conscious of no pain. </p>
                    <p>Presently a larger missile struck him in the neck, and he heard a breathless
                        snorting close behind him. That was the end; he gave himself up for lost,
                        for those boys would have no mercy on him if they captured him. </p>
                    <p>But in the next moment he heard a fall and an oath, and the voice was that of
                        Halvor Reitan. He breathed a little more freely as he saw the river run with
                        its swelling current at his feet. Quite mechanically, without clearly
                        knowing what he did, he sprang into the boat, grabbed a boat-hook, and with
                        three strong strokes pushed himself out into the deep water. </p>
                    <p>At that instant a dozen of his pursuers reached the river bank, and he saw
                        dimly their angry faces and threatening gestures, and heard the stones drop
                        into the stream about him. Fortunately the river was partly dammed, in order
                        to accumulate water for the many saw-mills under the falls. It would
                        therefore have been no very difficult feat to paddle <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0039" n="12"/> across, if across, if
                        his aching arms had had an atom of strength left in them. As soon as he was
                        beyond the reach of flying stones he seated himself in the stern, took an
                        oar, and after having bathed his throbbing forehead in the cold water,
                        managed, in fifteen minutes, to make the further bank. Then he dragged
                        himself wearily up the hill-side to Colonel H&ouml;&ouml;k's
                        mansion, and when he had given his message to Viggo, fell into a dead faint. </p>
                    <p>How could Viggo help being touched by such devotion? He had seen the race
                        through a fieldglass from his pigeon-cot, but had been unable to make out
                        its meaning, nor had he remotely dreamed that he was himself the cause of
                        the cruel chase. He called his mother, who soon perceived that Marcus's coat
                        was saturated with blood in the back, and undressing him, she found that a
                        stone, hurled by a sling, had struck him, slid a few inches along the rib,
                        and had lodged in the fleshy part of his left side. </p>
                    <p>A doctor was now sent for; the stone was cut out without difficulty, and
                        Marcus was invited to remain as Viggo's guest until he recovered. He felt so
                        honored by this invitation that he secretly prayed he might remain ill for a
                        month; but the wound showed an abominable readiness to heal, and before
                        three days were past Marcus could not feign any ailment which his face and
                        eye did not belie. </p>
                    <p>He then, with a heavy heart, betook himself homeward, and installed himself
                        once more among <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0040" n="13"/> his accustomed smells behind the store, and
                        pondered sadly on the caprice of the fate which had made Viggo a high-nosed,
                        handsome gentleman, and him&mdash;Marcus Henning&mdash;an
                        under-grown, homely, and unrefined drudge. But in spite of his failure to
                        answer this question, there was joy within him at the thought that he had
                        saved this handsome face of Viggo's from disfigurement, and&mdash;who
                        could know?&mdash;perhaps would earn a claim upon his gratitude. </p>
                    <p>It was this series of incidents which led to the war between the East-Siders
                        and the West-Siders. It was a mere accident that the partisans of Viggo
                        H&ouml;&ouml;k lived on the west side of the river, and those of
                        Halvor Reitan mostly on the east side. </p>
                    <p>Viggo, who had a chivalrous sense of fair play, would never have molested any
                        one without good cause; but now his own safety, and, as he persuaded
                        himself, even his life, was in danger, and he had no choice but to take
                        measures in self-defence. He surrounded himself with a trusty body-guard,
                        which attended him wherever he went. He sent little Marcus, in whom he
                        recognized his most devoted follower, as scout into the enemy's territory,
                        and swelled his importance enormously by lending him his field-glass to
                        assist him in his perilous observations. </p>
                    <p>Occasionally an unhappy East-Sider was captured on the west bank of the
                        river, court-martialed, and, <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0041" n="14"/> with much solemnity, sentenced to
                        death as a spy, but paroled for an indefinite period, until it should suit
                        his judges to execute the sentence. The East-Siders, when they captured a
                        West-Sider, went to work with less ceremony; they simply thrashed their
                        captive soundly and let him run, if run he could. </p>
                    <p>Thus months passed. The parson's Confirmation Class ceased, and both the
                        opposing chieftains were confirmed on the same day; but Viggo stood at the
                        head of the candidates, while Halvor had his place at the bottom.<ref n="1"
                            target="n1.1">[1]</ref>
                    </p>
                    <p>During the following winter the war was prosecuted with much zeal, and the
                        West-Siders, in imitation of Robin Hood and his Merry Men, armed themselves
                        with cross-bows, and lay in ambush in the underbrush, aiming their swift
                        arrows against any intruder who ventured to cross the river. </p>
                    <p>Nearly all the boys in the valley between twelve and sixteen became enlisted
                        on the one side or the other, and there were councils of war, marches, and
                        counter-marches without number, occasional skirmishes, but no decisive
                        engagements. Peer Oestmo, to be sure, had his eye put out by an arrow, as
                        has already been related, for the East-Siders were not <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0042" n="15"/> slow to
                        imitate the example of their enemies, in becoming expert archers. </p>
                    <p>Marcus Henning was captured by a hostile outpost, and was being conducted to
                        the abode of the chief, when, by a clever stratagem, he succeeded in making
                        his escape. </p>
                    <p>The East-Siders despatched, under a flag of truce, a most insulting
                        caricature of General Viggo, representing him as a rooster that seemed on
                        the point of bursting with an excess of dignity. </p>
                    <p>These were the chief incidents of the winter, though there were many others
                        of less consequence that served to keep the boys in a delightful state of
                        excitement. They enjoyed the war keenly, though they pretended to themselves
                        that they were being ill-used and suffered terrible hardships. They grumbled
                        at their duties, brought complaints against their officers to the general,
                        and did, in fact, all the things that real soldiers would have been likely
                        to do under similar circumstances.</p>

                    <head> II.<lb/> THE CLASH OF ARMS </head>

                    <p>WHEN the spring is late in Norway, and the heat comes with a sudden rush, the
                        mountain streams plunge with a tremendous noise down into the valleys, and
                        the air is filled far and near with the <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0043" n="16"/> boom and roar of
                        rushing waters. The glaciers groan, and send their milk-white torrents down
                        toward the ocean. The snow-patches in the forest glens look gray and soiled,
                        and the pines perspire a delicious resinous odor which cheers the soul with
                        the conviction that spring has come. </p>
                    <p>But the peasant looks anxiously at the sun and the river at such times, for
                        he knows that there is danger of inundation. The lumber, which the spring
                        floods set afloat in enormous quantities, is carried by the rivers to the
                        cities by the sea; there it is sorted according to the mark it bears,
                        showing the proprietor, and exported to foreign countries. </p>
                    <p>In order to prevent log-jams, which are often attended with terrible
                        disasters, men are stationed night and day at the narrows of the rivers. The
                        boys, to whom all excitement is welcome, are apt to congregate in large
                        numbers at such places, assisting or annoying the watchers, riding on the
                        logs, or teasing the girls who stand up on the hillside, admiring the daring
                        feats of the lumbermen. </p>
                    <p>It was on such a spring day, when the air was pungent with the smell of
                        sprouting birch and pine, that General Viggo and his trusty army had betaken
                        themselves to the cataract to share in the sport. They were armed with their
                        bows, as usual, knowing that they were always liable to be surprised by
                        their vigilant enemy. Nor were they in this instance disappointed, for
                        Halvor Reitan, with <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0044" n="17"/> fifty or sixty followers, was presently
                        visible on the east side, and it was a foregone conclusion that if they met
                        there would be a battle. </p>
                    <p>The river, to be sure, separated them, but the logs were at times so densely
                        packed that it was possible for a daring lad to run far out into the river,
                        shoot his arrow and return to shore, leaping from log to log. The Reitan
                        party was the first to begin this sport, and an arrow hit General Viggo's
                        hat before he gave orders to repel the assault. </p>
                    <p>Cool and dignified as he was, he could not consent to skip and jump on the
                        slippery logs, particularly as he had no experience in this difficult
                        exercise, while the enemy apparently had much. Paying no heed to the jeers
                        of the lumbermen, who supposed he was afraid, he drew his troops up in line
                        and addressed them as follows: </p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">"Soldiers</hi>: You have on many previous occasions given
                        me proof of your fidelity to duty and your brave and fearless spirit. I know
                        that I can, now as always, trust you to shed glory upon our arms, and to
                        maintain our noble fame and honorable traditions. </p>
                    <p>"The enemy is before us. You have heard and seen his challenge. It behooves
                        us to respond gallantly. To jump and skip like rabbits is unmilitary and
                        unsoldierlike. I propose that each of us shall select two large logs, tie
                        them together, procure, if possible, a boat-hook or an oar, and, sitting <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0045" 
                            n="18"/> astride the logs, boldly push out into the river. If we can
                        advance in a tolerably even line, which I think quite possible, we can send
                        so deadly a charge into the ranks of our adversaries that they will be
                        compelled to flee. Then we will land on the east side, occupy the heights,
                        and rout our foe. </p>
                    <p>"Now let each man do his duty. Forward, march!" </p>
                    <p>The lumbermen, whose sympathies were with the East-Siders, found this
                        performance highly diverting, but Viggo allowed himself in nowise to be
                        disturbed by their laughter or jeers. He marched his troops down to the
                        river-front, commanded "Rest arms!" and repeated once more his instructions;
                        then, flinging off his coat and waistcoat, he seized a boat-hook and ran
                        some hundred yards along the bank of the stream. </p>
                    <p>The river-bed was here expanded to a wide basin, in which the logs floated
                        lazily down to the cataract below. Trees and underbrush, which usually stood
                        on dry land, were half-submerged in the yellow water, and the current
                        gurgled slowly about their trunks with muddy foam and bubbles. Now and then
                        a heap of lumber would get wedged in between the jutting rocks above the
                        waterfall, and then the current slackened, only to be suddenly accelerated,
                        when the exertions of the men had again removed the obstruction. </p>
                    <p>It was an exciting spectacle to see these daring <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002438_0046" n="19"/> fellows leap
                        from log to log, with birch-bark shoes on their feet. They would ride on a
                        heap of lumber down to the very edge of the cataract, dexterously jump off
                        at the critical moment, and after half a dozen narrow escapes, reach the
                        shore, only to repeat the dangerous experiment, as soon as the next
                        opportunity offered itself. </p>
                    <p>It was the example of these hardy and agile lumbermen, trained from childhood
                        to sport with danger, which inspired Viggo and his followers with a desire
                        to show their mettle. </p>
                    <p>"Sergeant Henning," said the General to his ever-faithful shadow, "take a
                        squad of five men with you, and cut steering-poles for those for whom
                        boat-hooks cannot be procured. You will be the last to leave shore. Report
                        to me if any one fails to obey orders." </p>
                    <p>"Shall be done, General," Marcus responded, with a deferential military
                        salute. </p>
                    <p>"The bows, you understand, will be slung by the straps across the backs of
                        the men, while they steer and push with their poles." </p>
                    <p>"Certainly, General," said Marcus, with another salute. </p>
                    <p>"You may go." </p>
                    <p>"All right, General," answered Marcus, with a third salute. </p>
                    <p>And now began the battle. The East-Siders, fearing that a stratagem was
                        intended, when they <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0047" n="20"/> saw the enemy moving up the stream, made
                        haste to follow their example, capturing on their way every stray log that
                        came along. They sent ineffectual showers of arrows into the water, while
                        the brave General Viggo, striding two big logs which he had tied together
                        with a piece of rope, and with a boat-hook in his hand, pushed proudly at
                        the head of his army into the middle of the wide basin. </p>
                    <p>Halvor Reitan was clever enough to see what it meant, and he was not going to
                        allow the West-Siders to gain the heights above him, and attack him in the
                        rear. He meant to prevent the enemy from landing, or, still better, he would
                        meet him half-way, and drive him back to his own shore. </p>
                    <p>The latter, though not the wiser course, was the plan which Halvor Reitan
                        adopted. To have a tussle with the high-nosed Viggo in the middle of the
                        basin, to dislodge him from his raft&mdash;that seemed to Halvor a
                        delightful project. He knew that Viggo was a good swimmer, so he feared no
                        dangerous consequences; and even if he had, it would not have restrained
                        him. He was so much stronger than Viggo, and here was his much-longed-for
                        opportunity. </p>
                    <p>With great despatch he made himself a raft of two logs, and seating himself
                        astride them, with his legs in the water, put off from shore. He shouted <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0048" 
                            n="21"/> to his men to follow him, and they needed no urging. Viggo was
                        now near the middle of the basin, with twenty or thirty picked archers close
                        behind him. They fired volley after volley of arrows against the enemy, and
                        twice drove him back to the shore. </p>
                    <p>But Halvor Reitan, shielding his face with a piece of bark which he had
                        picked up, pushed forward in spite of their onslaught, though one arrow
                        knocked off his red-peaked cap, and another scratched his ear. Now he was
                        but a dozen feet from his foe. He cared little for his bow now; the
                        boat-hook was a far more effectual weapon. </p>
                    <p>Viggo saw at a glance that he meant to pull his raft toward him, and, relying
                        upon his greater strength, fling him into the water. His first plan would
                        therefore be to fence with his own boat-hook, so as to keep his antagonist
                        at a distance. </p>
                    <p>When Halvor made the first lunge at the nose of his raft, he foiled the
                        attempt with his own weapon, and managed dexterously to give the hostile
                        raft a downward push, which increased the distance between them. </p>
                    <p>"Take care, General!" said a respectful voice close to Viggo's ear. "There is
                        a small log jam down below, which is getting bigger every moment. When it is
                        got afloat, it will be dangerous out here." </p>
                    <p>"What are you doing here, Sergeant?" asked <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0049" n="22"/> the General,
                        severely. "Did I not tell you to be the last to leave the shore?" </p>
                    <p>"You did, General," Marcus replied, meekly, "and I obeyed. But I have pushed
                        to the front so as to be near you." </p>
                    <p>"I don't need you, Sergeant," Viggo responded, "you may go to the rear." </p>
                    <p>The booming of the cataract nearly drowned his voice and Marcus pretended not
                        to hear it. A huge lumber mass was piling itself up among the rocks jutting
                        out of the rapids, and a dozen men hanging like flies on the logs, sprang up
                        and down with axes in their hands. They cut one log here and another there;
                        shouted commands; and fell into the river amid the derisive jeers of the
                        spectators; they scrambled out again and, dripping wet, set to work once
                        more with a cheerful heart, to the mighty music of the cataract, whose
                        thundering rhythm trembled and throbbed in the air. </p>
                    <p>The boys who were steering their rafts against each other in the
                        comparatively placid basin were too absorbed in their mimic battle to heed
                        what was going on below. Halvor and Viggo were fighting desperately with
                        their boat-hooks, the one attacking and the other defending himself with
                        great dexterity. They scarcely perceived, in their excitement, that the
                        current was dragging them slowly toward the cataract; nor did they note the
                        warning cries of the men and women on the banks. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0050" n="23"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>Viggo's blood was hot, his temples throbbed, his eyes flashed. He would show
                        this miserable clown who had dared to insult him, that the trained skill of
                        a gentleman is worth more than the rude strength of a bully. With beautiful
                        precision he foiled every attack; struck Halvor's boat-hook up and down, so
                        that the water splashed about him, man&oelig;uvring at the same time his
                        own raft with admirable adroitness. </p>
                    <p>Cheer upon cheer rent the air, after each of his successful sallies, and his
                        comrades, selecting their antagonists from among the enemy, now pressed
                        forward, all eager to bear their part in the fray. </p>
                    <p>Splash! splash! splash! one East-Sider was dismounted, got an involuntary
                        bath, but scrambled up on his raft again. The next time it was a West-Sider
                        who got a ducking, but seemed none the worse for it. There was a yelling and
                        a cheering, now from one side and now from the other, which made everyone
                        forget that something was going on at that moment of greater importance than
                        the mimic warfare of boys. </p>
                    <p>All the interest of the contending parties was concentrated on the duel of
                        their chieftains. It seemed now really that Halvor was getting the worst of
                        it. He could not get close enough to use his brawny muscles; and in
                        precision of aim and adroitness of movement he was not Viggo's match. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0051" 
                            n="24"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>Again and again he thrust his long-handled boat-hook angrily against the
                        bottom (for the flooded parts of the banks were very shallow), to push the
                        raft forward, but every time Viggo managed to turn it sideward, and Halvor
                        had to exert all his presence of mind to keep his seat. Wild with rage he
                        sprang up on his slender raft and made a vicious lunge at his opponent, who
                        warded the blow with such force that the handle of the boat-hook broke, and
                        Halvor lost his balance and fell into the water. </p>
                    <p>At this same instant a tremendous crash was heard from below, followed by a
                        long rumble as of mighty artillery. A scream of horror went up from the
                        banks, as the great lumber mass rolled down into the cataract, making a
                        sudden suction which it seemed impossible that the unhappy boys could
                        resist. </p>
                    <p>The majority of both sides, seeing their danger, beat, by means of their
                        boat-hooks, a hasty retreat, and as they were in shallow water were hauled
                        ashore by the lumbermen, who sprang into the river to save them. </p>
                    <p>When the clouds of spray had cleared away, only three figures were visible.
                        Viggo, still astride of his raft, was fighting, not for his own life, but
                        for that of his enemy, Halvor, who was struggling helplessly in the white
                        rapids. Close behind his commander stood little Marcus on his raft, holding
                        on, with one hand to the boat-hook which he had hewn, with <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0052" n="25"/> all
                        his might, into Viggo's raft, and with the other grasping the branch of a
                        half-submerged tree. </p>
                    <p>"Save yourself, General!" he yelled, wildly. "Let go there. I can't hold on
                        much longer." </p>
                    <p>But Viggo did not heed. He saw nothing but the pale, frightened face of his
                        antagonist, who might lose his life. With a desperate effort he flung his
                        boat-hook toward him and succeeded this time in laying hold of the leather
                        girdle about his waist. One hundred feet below yawned the foaming, weltering
                        abyss, from which the white smoke ascended. If Marcus lost his grip, if the
                        branch snapped no human power could save them; they were all dead men. </p>
                    <p>By this time the people on the shore had discovered that three lives were
                        hanging on the brink of eternity. Twenty men had waded waist-deep into the
                        current and had flung a stout rope to the noble little fellow who was
                        risking his own life for his friend. </p>
                    <p>"Keep your hold, my brave lad!" they cried; "hold on another minute!" </p>
                    <p>"Grab the rope!" screamed others. </p>
                    <p>Marcus clinched his teeth, and his numb arms trembled, mist gathered in his
                        eyes&mdash;his heart stood still. But with a clutch that seemed
                        superhuman he held on. He had but one thought&mdash;Viggo, his chief!
                        Viggo, his idol! Viggo, his general! He must save him or die with him. One
                        end of the <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0053" n="26"/> rope was hanging on the branch and was within easy
                        reach; but he did not venture to seize it, lest the wrench caused by his
                        motion might detach his hold on Viggo's raft. </p>
                    <p>Viggo, who just now was pulling Halvor out of the water, saw in an instant
                        that he had by adding his weight to the raft, increased the chance of both
                        being carried to their death. With quick resolution he plunged the beak of
                        his own boat-hook into Marcus's raft, and shouted to Halvor to save himself.
                        The latter, taking in the situation at a glance, laid hold of the handle of
                        the boat-hook and together they pulled up alongside of Marcus and leaped
                        aboard his raft, whereupon Viggo's raft drifted downward and vanished in a
                        flash in the yellow torrent. </p>
                    <p>At that very instant Marcus's strength gave out; he relaxed his grip on the
                        branch, which slid out of his hand, and they would inevitably have darted
                        over the brink of the cataract if Viggo had not, with great adroitness,
                        snatched the rope from the branch of the half-submerged tree. </p>
                    <p>A wild shout, half a cheer, half a cry of relief, went up from the banks, as
                        the raft with the three lads was slowly hauled toward the shore by the
                        lumbermen who had thrown the rope. </p>
                    <p>Halvor Reitan was the first to step ashore. But no joyous welcome greeted him
                        from those whose sympathies had, a little while ago, been all on his <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0054" 
                            n="27"/> side. He hung around uneasily for some minutes, feeling perhaps
                        that he ought to say something to Viggo who had saved his life, but as he
                        could not think of anything which did not seem foolish, he skulked away
                        unnoticed toward the edge of the forest. </p>
                    <p>But when Viggo stepped ashore, carrying the unconscious Marcus in his arms,
                        how the crowd rushed forward to gaze at him, to press his hands, to call
                        down God's blessing upon him! He had never imagined that he was such a hero.
                        It was Marcus, not he, to whom their ovation was due. But poor
                        Marcus&mdash;it was well for him that he had fainted from over-exertion;
                        for otherwise he would have fainted from embarrassment at the honors which
                        would have been showered upon him. </p>
                    <p>The West-Siders, marching two abreast, with their bows slung across their
                        shoulders, escorted their general home, cheering and shouting as they went.
                        When they were half-way up the hillside, Marcus opened his eyes, and finding
                        himself so close to his beloved general, blushed crimson, scarlet, and
                        purple, and all the other shades that an embarrassed blush is capable of
                        assuming. </p>
                    <p>"Please, General," he stammered, "don't bother about me." </p>
                    <p>Viggo had thought of making a speech exalting the heroism of his faithful
                        follower. But he saw <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0055" n="28"/> at a glance that his praise would be more
                        grateful to Marcus, if he received it in private. </p>
                    <p>When, however, the boys gave him a parting cheer, in front of his father's
                        mansion, he forgot his resolution, leaped up on the steps, and lifting the
                        blushing Marcus above his head; called out: </p>
                    <p>"Three cheers for the bravest boy in Norway!"</p>

                <head> BICEPS GRIMLUND'S CHRISTMAS VACATION </head>

                <div2 id="d15" n="1" type="section">
                    <head> I. </head>

                    <p>THE great question which Albert Grimlund was debating was fraught with
                        unpleasant possibilities. He could not go home for the Christmas vacation,
                        for his father lived in Drontheim, which is so far away from Christiania
                        that it was scarcely worth while making the journey for a mere two-weeks'
                        holiday. Then, on the other hand, he had an old great-aunt who lived but a
                        few miles from the city. She had, from conscientious motives, he feared,
                        sent him an invitation to pass Christmas with her. But Albert had a poor
                        opinion of Aunt Elsbeth. He thought her a very tedious person. She had a
                        dozen cats, talked of nothing but sermons and lessons, and asked him
                        occasionally, with pleasant humor, whether he got many whippings at school.
                        She failed to comprehend that a boy could not amuse himself forever by
                        looking at the pictures in the old family Bible, holding yarn, and listening
                        to oft-repeated stories, which he knew by heart, concerning the doings and
                        sayings of his <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0057" n="30"/> grandfather. Aunt Elsbeth, after a previous
                        experience with her nephew, had come to regard boys as rather a
                        reprehensible kind of animal, who differed in many of their ways from girls,
                        and altogether to the boys' disadvantage. </p>
                    <p>Now, the prospect of being "caged" for two weeks with this estimable lady
                        was, as I said, not at all pleasant to Albert. He was sixteen years old,
                        loved out-door sports, and had no taste for cats. His chief pride was his
                        muscle, and no boy ever made his acquaintance without being invited to feel
                        the size and hardness of his biceps. This was a standing joke in the Latin
                        school, and Albert was generally known among his companions as "Biceps"
                        Grimlund. He was not very tall for his age, but broad-shouldered and
                        deep-chested, with something in his glance, his gait, and his manners which
                        showed that he had been born and bred near the sea. He cultivated a
                        weather-beaten complexion, and was particularly proud when the skin "peeled"
                        on his nose, which it usually did in the summer-time, during his visits to
                        his home in the extreme north. Like most blond people, when sunburnt, he was
                        red, not brown; and this became a source of great satisfaction when he
                        learned that Lord Nelson had the same peculiarity. Albert's favorite books
                        were the sea romances of Captain Marryat, whose "Peter Simple" and
                        "Midshipman Easy" he held to be the noblest products of <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0058" n="31"/> human
                        genius. It was a bitter disappointment to him that his father forbade his
                        going to sea and was educating him to be a "landlubber," which he had been
                        taught by his boy associates to regard as the most contemptible thing on
                        earth. </p>
                    <p>Two days before Christmas, Biceps Grimlund was sitting in his room, looking
                        gloomily out of the window. He wished to postpone as long as possible his
                        departure for Aunt Elsbeth's country-place, for he foresaw that both he and
                        she were doomed to a surfeit of each other's company during the coming
                        fortnight. At last he heaved a deep sigh and languidly began to pack his
                        trunk. He had just disposed the dear Marryat books on top of his starched
                        shirts, when he heard rapid footsteps on the stairs, and the next moment the
                        door burst open, and his classmate, Ralph Hoyer, rushed breathlessly into
                        the room. </p>
                    <p>"Biceps," he cried, "look at this! Here is a letter from my father, and he
                        tells me to invite one of my classmates to come home with me for the
                        vacation. Will you come? Oh, we shall have grand times, I tell you! No end
                        of fun!" </p>
                    <p>Albert, instead of answering, jumped up and danced a jig on the floor,
                        upsetting two chairs and breaking the wash-pitcher. </p>
                    <p>"Hurrah!" he cried, "I'm your man. Shake hands on it, Ralph! You have saved
                        me from two weeks of cats and yarn and moping! Give us your <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0059" n="32"/>
                        paw! I never was so glad to see anybody in all my life." </p>
                    <p>And to prove it, he seized Ralph by the shoulders, gave him a vigorous whirl
                        and forced him to join in the dance. </p>
                    <p>"Now, stop your nonsense," Ralph protested, laughing; "if you have so much
                        strength to waste, wait till we are at home in Solheim, and you'll have a
                        chance to use it profitably." </p>
                    <p>Albert flung himself down on his old rep-covered sofa. It seemed to have some
                        internal disorder, for its springs rattled and a vague musical twang
                        indicated that something or other had snapped. It had seen much
                        maltreatment, that poor old piece of furniture, and bore visible marks of
                        it. When, after various exhibitions of joy, their boisterous delight had
                        quieted down, both boys began to discuss their plans for the vacation. </p>
                    <p>"But I fear my groom may freeze, down there in the street," Ralph ejaculated,
                        cutting short the discussion; "it is bitter cold, and he can't leave the
                        horses. Hurry up, now, old man, and I'll help you pack." </p>
                    <p>It did not take them long to complete the packing. Albert sent a telegram to
                        his father, asking permission to accept Ralph's invitation; but, knowing
                        well that the reply would be favorable, did not think it necessary to wait
                        for it. With the assistance of his friend he now wrapped himself in two <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0060" 
                            n="33"/> overcoats, pulled a pair of thick woollen stockings over the
                        outside of his boots and a pair of fur-lined top-boots outside of these,
                        girded himself with three long scarfs, and pulled his brown otter-skin cap
                        down over his ears. He was nearly as broad as he was long, when he had
                        completed these operations, and descended into the street where the big
                        double-sleigh (made in the shape of a huge white swan) was awaiting them.
                        They now called at Ralph's lodgings, whence he presently emerged in a
                        similar Esquimau costume, wearing a wolf-skin coat which left nothing
                        visible except the tip of his nose and the steam of his breath. Then they
                        started off merrily with jingling bells, and waved a farewell toward many a
                        window, wherein were friends and acquaintances. They felt in so jolly a
                        mood, that they could not help shouting their joy in the face of all the
                        world, and crowing over all poor wretches who were left to spend the
                        holidays in the city.</p>

                    <head> II. </head>

                    <p>SOLHEIM was about twenty miles from the city, and it was nine o'clock in the
                        evening when the boys arrived there. The moon was shining brightly, and the
                        Milky Way, with its myriad stars, looked like a luminous mist across the
                        vault of the sky. The aurora borealis swept down from the north with white
                        and pink radiations which flushed <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0061" n="34"/> the dark blue sky for an
                        instant, and vanished. The earth was white, as far as the eye could reach
                        &mdash;splendidly, dazzlingly white. And out of the white radiance rose
                        the great dark pile of masonry called Solheim, with its tall chimneys and
                        dormer-windows and old-fashioned gables. Round about stood the tall leafless
                        maples and chestnut-trees, sparkling with frost and stretching their gaunt
                        arms against the heavens. The two horses, when they swung up before the
                        great front-door, were so white with hoar-frost that they looked shaggy like
                        goats, and no one could tell what was their original color. Their breath was
                        blown in two vapory columns from their nostrils and drifted about their
                        heads like steam about a locomotive. </p>
                    <p>The sleigh-bells had announced the arrival of the guests, and a great shout
                        of welcome was heard from the hall of the house, which seemed alive with
                        grownup people and children. Ralph jumped out of the sleigh, embraced at
                        random half a dozen people, one of whom was his mother, kissed right and
                        left, protesting laughingly against being smothered in affection, and
                        finally managed to introduce his friend, who for the moment was feeling a
                        trifle lonely. </p>
                    <p>"Here, father," he cried. "Biceps, this is my father; and, father, this is my
                        Biceps&mdash;" </p>
                    <p>"What stuff you are talking, boy," his father exclaimed. "How can this young
                        fellow be your biceps&mdash;" <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0062" n="35"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Well, how can a man keep his senses in such confusion?" said the son of the
                        house. "This is my friend and classmate, Albert Grimlund, <hi rend="italic"

                        Just feel his biceps, mother, and you'll see." </p>
                    <p>"No, I thank you. I'll take your word for it," replied Mrs. Hoyer. "As I
                        intend to treat him as a friend of my son should be treated, I hope he will
                        not feel inclined to give me any proof of his muscularity." </p>
                    <p>When, with the aid of the younger children, the travellers had divested
                        themselves of their various wraps and overcoats, they were ushered into the
                        old-fashioned sitting-room. In one corner roared an enormous, many-storied,
                        iron stove. It had a picture in relief, on one side, of Diana the Huntress,
                        with her nymphs and baying hounds. In the middle of the room stood a big
                        table, and in the middle of the table a big lamp, about which the entire
                        family soon gathered. It was so cosey and homelike that Albert, before he
                        had been half an hour in the room, felt gratefully the atmosphere of mutual
                        affection which pervaded the house. It amused him particularly to watch the
                        little girls, of whom there were six, and to observe their profound
                        admiration for their big brother. Every now and then one of them, sidling up
                        to him while he sat talking, would cautiously touch his ear or a curl of <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0063" 
                            n="36"/> his hair; and if he deigned to take any notice of her, offering
                        her, perhaps, a perfunctory kiss, her pride and pleasure were charming to
                        witness. </p>
                    <p>Presently the signal was given that supper was ready, and various savory
                        odors, which escaped, whenever a door was opened, served to arouse the
                        anticipations of the boys to the highest pitch. Now, if I did not have so
                        much else to tell you, I should stop here and describe that supper. There
                        were twenty-two people who sat down to it; but that was nothing unusual at
                        Solheim, for it was a hospitable house, where every wayfarer was welcome,
                        either to the table in the servants' hall or to the master's table in the
                        dining-room.</p>

                    <p>AT the stroke of ten all the family arose, and each in turn kissed the father
                        and mother good-night; whereupon Mr. Hoyer took the great lamp from the
                        table and mounted the stairs, followed by his pack of noisy boys and girls.
                        Albert and Ralph found themselves, with four smaller Hoyers, in an enormous
                        low-ceiled room with many windows. In three corners stood huge canopied
                        bedsteads, with flowered-chintz curtains and mountainous eiderdown coverings
                        which swelled up toward the ceiling. In the middle of the wall, opposite the
                        windows, a big iron stove, like the one in the sitting-room (only <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0064" n="37"
                        /> that it was adorned with a bunch of flowers, peaches, and grapes, and not
                        with Diana and her nymphs), was roaring merrily, and sending a long red
                        sheen from its draught-hole across the floor. </p>
                    <p>Around the big warm stove the boys gathered (for it was positively Siberian
                        in the region of the windows), and while undressing played various pranks
                        upon each other, which created much merriment. But the most laughter was
                        provoked at the expense of Finn Hoyer, a boy of fourteen, whose bare back
                        his brother insisted upon exhibiting to his guest; for it was decorated with
                        a fac-simile of the picture on the stove, showing roses and luscious peaches
                        and grapes in red relief. Three years before, on Christmas Eve, the boys had
                        stood about the red-hot stove, undressing for their bath, and Finn, who was
                        naked, had, in the general scrimmage to get first into the bath-tub, been
                        pushed against the glowing iron, the ornamentation of which had been
                        beautifully burned upon his back. He had to be wrapped in oil and cotton
                        after that adventure, and he recovered in due time, but never quite relished
                        the distinction he had acquired by his pictorial skin. </p>
                    <p>It was long before Albert fell asleep; for the cold kept up a continual
                        fusillade, as of musketry, during the entire night. The woodwork of the
                        walls snapped and cracked with loud reports; and a little after midnight a
                        servant came in and stuffed the <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0065" n="38"/> stove full of birch-wood, until
                        it roared like an angry lion. This roar finally lulled Albert to sleep, in
                        spite of the startling noises about him. </p>
                    <p>The next morning the boys were aroused at seven o'clock by a servant, who
                        brought a tray with the most fragrant coffee and hot rolls. It was in honor
                        of the guest that, in accordance with Norse custom, this early meal was
                        served; and all the boys, carrying pillows and blankets, gathered on
                        Albert's and Ralph's bed and feasted right royally. So it seemed to them, at
                        least; for any break in the ordinary routine, be it ever so slight, is an
                        event to the young. Then they had a pillow-fight, thawed at the stove the
                        water in the pitchers (for it was frozen hard), and arrayed themselves to
                        descend and meet the family at the nine o'clock breakfast. When this repast
                        was at an end, the question arose how they were to entertain their guest,
                        and various plans were proposed. But to all Ralph's propositions his mother
                        interposed the objection that it was too cold. </p>
                    <p>"Mother is right," said Mr. Hoyer; "it is so cold that `the chips jump on the
                        hill-side.' You'll have to be content with indoor sports to-day." </p>
                    <p>"But, father, it is not more than twenty degrees below zero," the boy
                        demurred. "I am sure we can stand that, if we keep in motion. I have been
                        out at thirty without losing either ears or nose." </p>
                    <p>He went to the window to observe the thermometer; <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002438_0066"  n="39"/> but the dim
                        daylight scarcely penetrated the fantastic frost-crystals, which, like a
                        splendid exotic flora, covered the panes. Only at the upper corner, where
                        the ice had commenced to thaw, a few timid sunbeams were peeping in, making
                        the lamp upon the table seem pale and sickly. Whenever the door to the hall
                        was opened a white cloud of vapor rolled in; and every one made haste to
                        shut the door, in order to save the precious heat. The boys, being doomed to
                        remain indoors, walked about restlessly, felt each other's muscle, punched
                        each other, and sometimes, for want of better employment, teased the little
                        girls. Mr. Hoyer, seeing how miserable they were, finally took pity on them,
                        and, after having thawed out a window-pane sufficiently to see the
                        thermometer outside, gave his consent to a little expedition on <hi
                            rend="italic">skees</hi><ref n="2" target="n2.1">[1]</ref> down to the
                        river. </p>
                    <p>And now, boys, you ought to have seen them! Now there was life in them! You
                        would scarcely have dreamed that they were the same creatures who, a moment
                        ago, looked so listless and miserable. What rollicking laughter and fun,
                        while they bundled one another in scarfs, cardigan-jackets, fur-lined
                        top-boots, and overcoats! </p>
                    <p>"You had better take your guns along, boys," said the father, as they stormed
                        out through the front door; "you might strike a couple of ptarmigan, or a
                        mountain-cock, over on the west side." <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0067"  n="40"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"I am going to take your rifle, if you'll let me," Ralph exclaimed. "I have a
                        fancy we might strike bigger game than mountain-cock. I shouldn't object to
                        a wolf or two." </p>
                    <p>"You are welcome to the rifle," said his father; "but I doubt whether you'll
                        find wolves on the ice so early in the day." </p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoyer took the rifle from its case, examined it carefully, and handed it
                        to Ralph. Albert, who was a less experienced hunter than Ralph, preferred a
                        fowling-piece to the rifle; especially as he had no expectation of shooting
                        anything but ptarmigan. Powder-horns, cartridges, and shot were provided;
                        and quite proudly the two friends started off on their skees, gliding over
                        the hard crust of the snow, which, as the sun rose higher, was oversown with
                        thousands of glittering gems. The boys looked like Esquimaux, with their
                        heads bundled up in scarfs, and nothing visible except their eyes and a few
                        hoary locks of hair which the frost had silvered.</p>

                    <p>"WHAT was that?" cried Albert, startled by a sharp report which reverberated
                        from the mountains. They had penetrated the forest on the west side, and
                        ranged over the ice for an hour, in a vain search for wolves. </p>
                    <p>"Hush," said Ralph, excitedly; and after a moment <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002438_0068"  n="41"/> of intent
                        listening he added, "I'll be drawn and quartered if it isn't poachers!" </p>
                    <p>"How do you know?" </p>
                    <p>"These woods belong to father, and no one else has any right to hunt in them.
                        He doesn't mind if a poor man kills a hare or two, or a brace of ptarmigan;
                        but these chaps are after elk; and if the old gentleman gets on the scent of
                        elk-hunters, he has no more mercy than Beelzebub." </p>
                    <p>"How can you know that they are after elk?" </p>
                    <p>"No man is likely to go to the woods for small game on a day like this. They
                        think the cold protects them from pursuit and capture." </p>
                    <p>"What are you going to do about it?" </p>
                    <p>"I am going to play a trick on them. You know that the sheriff, whose duty it
                        is to be on the lookout for elk-poachers, would scarcely send out a posse
                        when the cold is so intense. Elk, you know, are becoming very scarce, and
                        the law protects them. No man is allowed to shoot more than one elf a year,
                        and that one on his own property. Now, you and I will play deputy-sheriffs,
                        and have those poachers securely in the lock-up before night." </p>
                    <p>"But suppose they fight?" </p>
                    <p>"Then we'll fight back." </p>
                    <p>Ralph was so aglow with joyous excitement at the thought of this adventure,
                        that Albert had not the heart to throw cold water on his enthusiasm.
                        Moreover, he was afraid of being thought cowardly <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0069"  n="42"/> by his friend
                        if he offered objections. The recollection of Midshipman Easy and his daring
                        pranks flashed through his brain, and he felt an instant desire to rival the
                        exploits of his favorite hero. If only the enterprise had been on the sea he
                        would have been twice as happy, for the land always seemed to him a prosy
                        and inconvenient place for the exhibition of heroism. </p>
                    <p>"But, Ralph," he exclaimed, now more than ready to bear his part in the
                        expedition, "I have only shot in my gun. You can't shoot men with
                        bird-shot." </p>
                    <p>"Shoot men I Are you crazy? Why, I don't intend to shoot anybody. I only wish
                        to capture them. My rifle is a breech-loader and has six cartridges.
                        Besides, it has twice the range of theirs (for there isn't another such
                        rifle in all Odalen), and by firing one shot over their heads I can bring
                        them to terms, don't you see?" </p>
                    <p>Albert, to be frank, did not see it exactly; but he thought it best to
                        suppress his doubts. He scented danger in the air, and his blood bounded
                        through his veins. </p>
                    <p>"How do you expect to track them?" he asked, breathlessly. </p>
                    <p>"Skee-tracks in the snow can be seen by a bat, born blind," answered Ralph,
                        recklessly. </p>
                    <p>They were now climbing up the wooded slope on the western side of the river.
                        The crust of the <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0070"  n="43"/> frozen snow was strong enough to bear them;
                        and as it was not glazed, but covered with an inch of hoar-frost, it
                        retained the imprint of their feet with distinctness. They were obliged to
                        carry their skees, on account both of the steepness of the slope and the
                        density of the underbrush. Roads and paths were invisible under the white
                        pall of the snow, and only the facility with which they could retrace their
                        steps saved them from the fear of going astray. Through the vast forest a
                        deathlike silence reigned; and this silence was not made up of an infinity
                        of tiny sounds, like the silence of a summer day when the crickets whirr in
                        the treetops and the bees drone in the clover-blossoms. No; this silence was
                        dead, chilling, terrible. The huge pine-trees now and then dropped a load of
                        snow on the heads of the bold intruders, and it fell with a thud, followed
                        by a noiseless, glittering drizzle. As far as their eyes could reach, the
                        monotonous colonnade of brown tree-trunks, rising out of the white waste,
                        extended in all directions. It reminded them of the enchanted forest in
                        "Undine," through which a man might ride forever without finding the end. It
                        was a great relief when, from time to time, they met a squirrel out foraging
                        for pine-cones or picking up a scanty living among the husks of last year's
                        hazel-nuts. He was lively in spite of the weather, and the faint noises of
                        his small activities fell gratefully upon ears already appalled <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0071"  n="44"/>
                        by the awful silence. Occasionally they scared up a brace of grouse that
                        seemed half benumbed, and hopped about in a melancholy manner under the
                        pines, or a magpie, drawing in its head and ruffling up its feathers against
                        the cold, until it looked frowsy and disreputable. </p>
                    <p>"Biceps," whispered Ralph, who had suddenly discovered something interesting
                        in the snow, "do you see that?" </p>
                    <p>"Je-rusalem!" ejaculated Albert, with thoughtless delight, "it is a
                        hoof-track!" </p>
                    <p>"Hold your tongue, you blockhead," warned his friend, too excited to be
                        polite, "or you'll spoil the whole business!" </p>
                    <p>"But you asked me," protested Albert, in a huff. </p>
                    <p>"But I didn't shout, did I?" </p>
                    <p>Again the report of a shot tore a great rent in the wintry stillness and rang
                        out with sharp reverberations. </p>
                    <p>"We've got them," said Ralph, examining the lock of his rifle. "That shot
                        settles them." </p>
                    <p>"If we don't look out, they may get us instead," grumbled Albert, who was
                        still offended. </p>
                    <p>Ralph stood peering into the underbrush, his eyes as wild as those of an
                        Indian, his nostrils dilated, and all his senses intensely awake. His
                        companion, who was wholly unskilled in woodcraft, could see no cause for his
                        agitation, and feared that <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0072"  n="45"/> he was yet angry. He did not detect
                        the evidences of large game in the immediate neighborhood. He did not see,
                        by the bend of the broken twigs and the small tufts of hair on the
                        briar-bush, that an elk had pushed through that very copse within a few
                        minutes; nor did he sniff the gamy odor with which the large beast had
                        charged the air. In obedience to his friend's gesture, he flung himself down
                        on hands and knees and cautiously crept after him through the thicket. He
                        now saw without difficulty a place where the elk had broken through the snow
                        crust, and he could also detect a certain aimless bewilderment in the
                        tracks, owing, no doubt, to the shot and the animal's perception of danger
                        on two sides. Scarcely had he crawled twenty feet when he was startled by a
                        noise of breaking branches, and before he had time to cock his gun, he saw
                        an enormous bull-elk tearing through the underbrush, blowing two columns of
                        steam from his nostrils, and steering straight toward them. At the same
                        instant Ralph's rifle blazed away, and the splendid beast, rearing on its
                        hind legs, gave a wild snort, plunged forward and rolled on its side in the
                        snow. Quick as a flash the young hunter had drawn his knife, and, in
                        accordance with the laws of the chase, had driven it into the breast of the
                        animal. But the glance from the dying eyes&mdash;that glance, of which
                        every elk-hunter can tell a moving tale&mdash;pierced the boy to the
                        very heart! It was such a <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0073"  n="46"/> touching, appealing, imploring
                        glance, so soft and gentle and unresentful. </p>
                    <p>"Why did you harm me," it seemed to say, "who never harmed any living
                        thing&mdash;who claimed only the right to live my frugal life in the
                        forest, digging up the frozen mosses under the snow, which no mortal
                        creature except myself can eat?" </p>
                    <p>The sanguinary instinct&mdash;the fever for killing, which every boy
                        inherits from savage ancestors&mdash;had left Ralph, before he had
                        pulled the knife from the bleeding wound. A miserable feeling of guilt stole
                        over him. He never had shot an elk before; and his father, who was anxious
                        to preserve the noble beasts from destruction, had not availed himself of
                        his right to kill one for many years. Ralph had, indeed, many a time hunted
                        rabbits, hares, mountain-cock, and capercailzie. But they had never
                        destroyed his pleasure by arousing pity for their deaths; and he had always
                        regarded himself as being proof against sentimental emotions. </p>
                    <p>"Look here, Biceps," he said, flinging the knife into the snow, "I wish I
                        hadn't killed that bull." </p>
                    <p>"I thought we were hunting for poachers," answered Albert, dubiously; "and
                        now we have been poaching ourselves." </p>
                    <p>"By Jiminy! So we have; and I never once thought of it," cried the valiant
                        hunter. "I am afraid we are off my father's preserves too. It is well the
                        deputy sheriffs are not abroad, or we might <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0074"  n="47"/> find ourselves
                        decorated with iron bracelets before night." </p>
                    <p>"But what did you do it for?" </p>
                    <p>"Well, I can't tell. It's in the blood, I fancy. The moment I saw the track
                        and caught the wild smell, I forgot all about the poachers, and started on
                        the scent like a hound." </p>
                    <p>The two boys stood for some minutes looking at the dead animal, not with
                        savage exultation, but. with a dim regret. The blood which was gushing from
                        the wound in the breast froze in a solid lump the very moment it touched the
                        snow, although the cold had greatly moderated since the morning. </p>
                    <p>"I suppose we'll have to skin the fellow," remarked Ralph, lugubriously; "it
                        won't do to leave that fine carcass for the wolves to celebrate Christmas
                        with." </p>
                    <p>"All right," Albert answered, "I am not much of a hand at skinning, but I'll
                        do the best I can." </p>
                    <p>They fell to work rather reluctantly at the unwonted task, but had not
                        proceeded far when they perceived that they had a full day's job before
                        them. </p>
                    <p>"I've no talent for the butcher's trade," Ralph exclaimed in disgust,
                        dropping his knife into the snow. "There's no help for it, Biceps, we'll
                        have to bury the carcass, pile some logs on the top of it, and send a horse
                        to drag it home to-morrow. If it were not Christmas Eve to-night we might
                        take a <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0075"  n="48"/> couple of men along and shoot a dozen wolves or more.
                        For there is sure to be pandemonium here before long, and a concert in
                        G-flat that'll curdle the marrow of your bones with horror." </p>
                    <p>"Thanks," replied the admirer of Midshipman Easy, striking a reckless naval
                        attitude. "The marrow of my bones is not so easily curdled. I've been on a
                        whaling voyage, which is more than you have." </p>
                    <p>Ralph was about to vindicate his dignity by referring to his own valiant
                        exploits, when suddenly his keen eyes detected a slight motion in the
                        underbrush on the slope below. </p>
                    <p>"Biceps," he said, with forced composure, "those poachers are tracking us." </p>
                    <p>"What do you mean?" asked Albert, in vague alarm. </p>
                    <p>"Do you see the top of that young birch waving?" </p>
                    <p>"Well, what of that!" </p>
                    <p>"Wait and see. It's no good trying to escape. They can easily overtake us.
                        The snow is the worst tell-tale under the sun." </p>
                    <p>"But why should we wish to escape? I thought we were going to catch them." </p>
                    <p>"So we were; but that was before we turned poachers ourselves. Now those
                        fellows will turn the tables on us&mdash;take us to the sheriff and
                        collect half the fine, which is fifty dollars, as informers." <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0076"  n="49"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Je-rusalem!" cried Biceps, "isn't it a beautiful scrape we've gotten into?" </p>
                    <p>"Rather," responded his friend, coolly. </p>
                    <p>"But why meekly allow ourselves to be captured? Why not defend ourselves?" </p>
                    <p>"My dear Biceps, you don't know what you are talking about. Those fellows
                        don't mind putting a bullet into you, if you run. Now, I'd rather pay fifty
                        dollars any day, than shoot a man even in self-defence." </p>
                    <p>"But they have killed elk too. We heard them shoot twice. Suppose we play the
                        same game on them that they intend to play on us. We can play informers too,
                        then we'll at least be quits." </p>
                    <p>"Biceps, you are a brick! That's a capital idea! Then let us start for the
                        sheriff's; and if we get there first, we'll inform both on ourselves and on
                        them. That'll cancel the fine. Quick, now!" </p>
                    <p>No persuasions were needed to make Albert bestir himself. He leaped toward
                        his skees, and following his friend, who was a few rods ahead of him,
                        started down the slope in a zigzag line, cautiously steering his way among
                        the tree trunks. The boys had taken their departure none too soon; for they
                        were scarcely five hundred yards down the declivity, when they heard behind
                        them loud exclamations and oaths. Evidently the poachers had stopped to roll
                        some logs (which were lying close by) over the carcass, probably meaning to
                        appropriate it; and <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0077"  n="50"/> this gave the boys an advantage, of which
                        they were in great need. After a few moments they espied an open clearing
                        which sloped steeply down toward the river. Toward this Ralph had been
                        directing his course; for although it was a venturesome undertaking to slide
                        down so steep and rugged a hill, he was determined rather to break his neck
                        than lower his pride, and become the laughing-stock of the parish. </p>
                    <p>One more tack through alder copse and juniper jungle&mdash;hard indeed,
                        and terribly vexatious&mdash;and he saw with delight the great open
                        slope, covered with an unbroken surface of glittering snow. The sun (which
                        at midwinter is but a few hours above the horizon) had set; and the stars
                        were flashing forth with dazzling brilliancy. Ralph stopped, as he reached
                        the clearing, to give Biceps an opportunity to overtake him; for Biceps,
                        like all marine animals, moved with less dexterity on the dry land. </p>
                    <p>"Ralph," he whispered breathlessly, as he pushed himself up to his companion
                        with a vigorous thrust of his skee-staff, "there are two awful chaps close
                        behind us. I distinctly heard them speak." </p>
                    <p>"Fiddlesticks," said Ralph; "now let us see what you are made of! Don't take
                        my track, or you may impale me like a roast pig on a spit. Now,
                        ready!&mdash;one, two, three!" </p>
                    <p>"Hold on there, or I shoot," yelled a hoarse voice from out of the
                        underbrush; but it was too late; for <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0078" n="51"/> at the same instant the
                        two boys slid out over the steep slope, and, wrapped in a whirl of loose
                        snow, were scudding at a dizzying speed down the precipitous hill-side.
                        Thump, thump, thump, they went, where hidden wood-piles or fences obstructed
                        their path, and out they shot into space, but each time came down firmly on
                        their feet, and dashed ahead with undiminished ardor. Their calves ached,
                        the cold air whistled in their ears, and their eyelids became stiff and
                        their sight half obscured with the hoar-frost that fringed their lashes. But
                        onward they sped, keeping their balance with wonderful skill, until they
                        reached the gentler slope which formed the banks of the great river. Then
                        for the first time Ralph had an opportunity to look behind him, and he saw
                        two moving whirls of snow darting downward, not far from his own track. His
                        heart beat in his throat; for those fellows had both endurance and skill,
                        and he feared that he was no match for them. But suddenly&mdash;he could
                        have yelled with delight&mdash;the foremost figure leaped into the air,
                        turned a tremendous somersault, and, coming down on his head, broke through
                        the crust of the snow and vanished, while his skees started on an
                        independent journey down the hill-side. He had struck an exposed fence-rail,
                        which, abruptly checking his speed, had sent him flying like a rocket. </p>
                    <p>The other poacher had barely time to change his course, so as to avoid the
                        snag; but he was unable <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0079" n="52"/> to stop and render assistance to his
                        fallen comrade. The boys, just as they were shooting out upon the ice, saw
                        by his motions that he was hesitating whether or not he should give up the
                        chase. He used his staff as a brake for a few moments, so as to retard his
                        speed; but discovering, perhaps, by the brightening starlight, that his
                        adversaries were not full-grown men, he took courage, started forward again,
                        and tried to make up for the time he had lost. If he could but reach the
                        sheriff's house before the boys did, he could have them arrested and collect
                        the informer's fee, instead of being himself arrested and fined as a
                        poacher. It was a prize worth racing for! And, moreover, there were two
                        elks, worth twenty-five dollars apiece, buried in the snow under logs. These
                        also would belong to the victor! The poacher dashed ahead, straining every
                        nerve, and reached safely the foot of the steep declivity. The boys were now
                        but a few hundred yards ahead of him. </p>
                    <p>"Hold on there," he yelled again, "or I shoot!" </p>
                    <p>He was not within range, but he thought he could frighten the youngsters into
                        abandoning the race. The sheriff's house was but a short distance up the
                        river. Its tall, black chimneys could he seen looming up against the starlit
                        sky. There was no slope now to accelerate their speed. They had to peg away
                        for dear life, pushing themselves forward with their skee-staves, laboring
                        like plough-horses, panting, snorting, perspiring. Ralph turned his <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0080" n="53"/> head once more. The poacher was gaining upon them; there could
                        be do doubt of it. He was within the range of Ralph's rifle; and a sturdy
                        fellow he was, who seemed good for a couple of miles yet. Should Ralph send
                        a bullet over his head to frighten him? No; that might give the poacher an
                        excuse for sending back a bullet with a less innocent purpose. Poor Biceps,
                        he was panting and puffing in his heavy wraps like a steamboat! He did not
                        once open his mouth to speak; but, exerting his vaunted muscle to the
                        utmost, kept abreast of his friend, and sometimes pushed a pace or two ahead
                        of him. But it cost him a mighty effort! And yet the poacher was gaining
                        upon him! They could see the long broadside of windows in the sheriff's
                        mansion, ablaze with Christmas candles. They came nearer and nearer! The
                        church-bells up on the bend were ringing in the festival. Five minutes more
                        and they would be at their goal. Five minutes more! Surely they had strength
                        enough left for that small space of time. So had the poacher, probably! The
                        question was, which had the most. Then, with a short, sharp resonance,
                        followed by a long reverberation, a shot rang out and a bullet whizzed past
                        Ralph's ear. It was the poacher who had broken the peace. Ralph, his blood
                        boiling with wrath, came to a sudden stop, flung his rifle to his cheek and
                        cried, "Drop that gun!" </p>
                    <p>The poacher, bearing down with all his might on <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002438_0081"  n="54"/> the skee-staff,
                        checked his speed. In the meanwhile Albert hurried on, seeing that the issue
                        of the race depended upon him. </p>
                    <p>"Don't force me to hurt ye!" shouted the poacher, threateningly, to Ralph,
                        taking aim once more. </p>
                    <p>"You can't," Ralph shouted back. "You haven't another shot." </p>
                    <p>At that instant sounds of sleigh-bells and voices were heard, and half a
                        dozen people, startled by the shot, were seen rushing out from the sheriff's
                        mansion. Among them was Mr. Bjornerud himself, with one of his deputies. </p>
                    <p>"In the name of the law, I command you to cease," he cried, when he saw down
                        the two figures in menacing attitudes. But before he could say another word,
                        some one fell prostrate in the road before him, gasping: </p>
                    <p>"We have shot an elk; so has that man down on the ice. We give ourselves up." </p>
                    <p>Mr. Bjornerud, making no answer, leaped over the prostrate figure, and,
                        followed by the deputy, dashed down upon the ice. </p>
                    <p>"In the name of the law!" he shouted again, and both rifles were reluctantly
                        lowered. </p>
                    <p>"I have shot an elk," cried Ralph, eagerly, "and this man is a poacher, we
                        heard him shoot." </p>
                    <p>"I have killed an elk," screamed the poacher, in the same moment, "and so has
                        this fellow." <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0082"  n="55"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>The sheriff was too astonished to speak. Never before, in his experience, had
                        poachers raced for dear life to give themselves into custody. He feared that
                        they were making sport of him; in that case, however, he resolved to make
                        them suffer for their audacity. </p>
                    <p>"You are my prisoners," he said, after a moment's hesitation. "Take them to
                        the lock-up, Olsen, and handcuff them securely," he added, turning to his
                        deputy. </p>
                    <p>There were now a dozen men&mdash;most of them guests and attendants of
                        the sheriff's household&mdash;standing in a ring about Ralph and the
                        poacher. Albert, too, had scrambled to his feet and had joined his comrade. </p>
                    <p>"Will you permit me, Mr. Sheriff," said Ralph, making the officer his
                        politest bow, "to send a message to my father, who is probably anxious about
                        us?" </p>
                    <p>"And who is your father, young man?" asked the sheriff, not unkindly; "I
                        should think you were doing him an ill-turn in taking to poaching at your
                        early age." </p>
                    <p>"My father is Mr. Hoyer, of Solheim," said the boy, not without some pride in
                        the announcement. </p>
                    <p>"What&mdash;you rascal, you! Are you trying to, play pranks on an old
                        man?" cried the officer of the law, grasping Ralph cordially by the hand.
                        "You've grown to be quite a man, since I saw you <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0083"  n="56"/> last. Pardon
                        me for not recognizing the son of an old neighbor." </p>
                    <p>"Allow me to introduce to you my friend, Mr. Biceps&mdash;I mean, Mr.
                        Albert Grimlund." </p>
                    <p>"Happy to make your acquaintance, Mr. Biceps Albert; and now you must both
                        come and eat the Christmas porridge with us. I'll send a messenger to Mr.
                        Hoyer without delay." </p>
                    <p>The sheriff, in a jolly mood, and happy to have added to the number of his
                        Christmas guests, took each of the two young men by the arm, as if he were
                        going to arrest them, and conducted them through the spacious front hall
                        into a large cosey room, where, having divested themselves of their wraps,
                        they told the story of their adventure. </p>
                    <p>"But, my dear sir," Mr. Bjornerud exclaimed, "I don't see how you managed to
                        go beyond your father's preserves. You know he bought of me the whole forest
                        tract, adjoining his own on the south, about three months ago. So you were
                        perfectly within your rights; for your father hasn't killed an elk on his
                        land for three years." </p>
                    <p>"If that is the case, Mr. Sheriff," said Ralph, "I must beg of you to release
                        the poor fellow who chased us. I don't wish any informer's fee, nor have I
                        any desire to get him into trouble." </p>
                    <p>"I am sorry to say I can't accommodate you," Bjornerud replied. "This man is
                        a notorious poacher and trespasser, whom my deputies have <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0084"  n="57"/> long
                        been tracking in vain. Now that I have him I shall keep him. There's no elk
                        safe in Odalen so long as that rascal is at large." </p>
                    <p>"That may be; but I shall then turn my informer's fee over to him, which will
                        reduce his fine from fifty dollars to twenty-five dollars." </p>
                    <p>"To encourage him to continue poaching?" </p>
                    <p>"Well, I confess I have a little more sympathy with poachers, since we came
                        so near being poachers ourselves. It was only an accident that saved us!"</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0085"  n="58"/>

                <head> THE NIXY'S STRAIN </head>

                <p>LTTTLE Nils had an idea that he wanted to be something great in the world, but he
                    did not quite know how to set about it. He had always been told that, having
                    been born on a Sunday, he was a luck-child, and that good fortune would attend
                    him on that account in whatever he undertook. </p>
                <p>He had never, so far, noticed anything peculiar about himself, though, to be
                    sure, his small enterprises did not usually come to grief, his snares were
                    seldom empty, and his tiny stamping-mill, which he and his friend Thorstein had
                    worked at so faithfully, was now making a merry noise over in the brook in the
                    Westmo Glen, so that you could hear it a hundred yards away. </p>
                <p>The reason of this, his mother told him, according to the superstition of her
                    people, was that the Nixy and the Hulder<ref n="3" target="n3.1">[1]</ref> and
                    the gnomes favored him because he was a Sunday child. What was more, she assured
                    him, that he would see them some day, and then, if he conducted himself
                    cleverly, so <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0086"  n="59"/> as to win their favor, he would, by their aid, rise
                    high in the world, and make his fortune. </p>
                <p>Now this was exactly what Nils wanted, and therefore he was not a little anxious
                    to catch a glimpse of the mysterious creatures who had so whimsical a reason for
                    taking an interest in him. Many and many a time he sat at the waterfall where
                    the Nixy was said to play the harp every midsummer night, but although he
                    sometimes imagined that he heard a vague melody trembling through the rush and
                    roar of the water, and saw glimpses of white limbs flashing through the current,
                    yet never did he get a good look at the Nixy. </p>
                <p>Though he roamed through the woods early and late, setting snares for birds and
                    rabbits, and was ever on the alert for a sight of the Hulder's golden hair and
                    scarlet bodice, the tricksy sprite persisted in eluding him. </p>
                <p>He thought sometimes that he heard a faint, girlish giggle, full of teasing
                    provocation and suppressed glee, among the underbrush, and once he imagined that
                    he saw a gleam of scarlet and gold vanish in a dense alder copse. </p>
                <p>But very little good did that do him, when he could not fix the vision, talk with
                    it face to face, and extort the fulfilment of the three regulation wishes. </p>
                <p>"I am probably not good enough," thought Nils. "I know I am a selfish fellow, and
                    cruel, too, sometimes, <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0087"  n="60"/> to birds and beasts. I suppose she won't
                    have anything to do with me, as long as she isn't satisfied with my behavior." </p>
                <p>Then he tried hard to be kind and considerate; smiled at his little sister when
                    she pulled his hair, patted Sultan, the dog, instead of kicking him, when he was
                    in his way, and never complained or sulked when he was sent on errands late at
                    night or in bad weather. </p>
                <p>But, strange to say, though the Nixy's mysterious melody still sounded vaguely
                    through the water's roar, and the Hulder seemed to titter behind the tree-trunks
                    and vanish in the underbrush, a real, unmistakable view was never vouchsafed to
                    Nils, and the three wishes which were to make his fortune he had no chance of
                    propounding. </p>
                <p>He had fully made up his mind what his wishes were to be, for he was determined
                    not to be taken by surprise. He knew well the fate of those foolish persons in
                    the fairy tales who offend their benevolent protectors by bouncing against them
                    head foremost, as it were, with a greedy cry for wealth. </p>
                <p>Nils was not going to be caught that way. He would ask first for
                    wisdom&mdash;that was what all right-minded heroes did&mdash;then for
                    good repute among men, and lastly&mdash;and here was the
                    rub&mdash;lastly he was inclined to ask for a five-bladed knife, like the
                    one the parson's Thorwald had got for a Christmas present. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002438_0088"  n="61"/>
                </p>
                <p>But he had considerable misgiving about the expediency of this last wish. If he
                    had a fair renown and wisdom, might he not be able to get along without a
                    five-bladed pocket-knife? But no; there was no help for it. Without that
                    five-bladed pocket-knife neither wisdom nor fame would satisfy him. It would be
                    the drop of gall in his cup of joy. </p>
                <p>After many days' pondering, it occurred to him, as a way out of the difficulty,
                    that it would, perhaps, not offend the Hulder if he asked, not for wealth, but
                    for a moderate prosperity. If he were blessed with a moderate prosperity, he
                    could, of course, buy a five-bladed pocket-knife with corkscrew and all other
                    appurtenances, and still have something left over. </p>
                <p>He had a dreadful struggle with this question, for he was well aware that the
                    proper things to wish were long life and happiness for his father and mother, or
                    something in that line. But, though he wished his father and mother well, he
                    could not make up his mind to forego his own precious chances on their account.
                    Moreover, he consoled himself with the reflection that if he attained the goal
                    of his own desires he could easily bestow upon them, of his bounty, a reasonable
                    prospect of long life and happiness. </p>
                <p>You see Nils was by no means so good yet as he ought to be. He was clever enough
                    to perceive <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0089"  n="62"/> that he had small chance of seeing the Hulder, as long
                    as his heart was full of selfishness and envy and greed. </p>
                <p>For, strive as he might, he could not help feeling envious of the parson's
                    Thorwald, with his elaborate combination pocket-knife and his silver
                    watch-chain, which he unfeelingly flaunted in the face of an admiring community.
                    It was small consolation for Nils to know that there was no watch but only a key
                    attached to it; for a silver watch-chain, even without a watch, was a
                    sufficiently splendid possession to justify a boy in fording it over his less
                    fortunate comrades. </p>
                <p>Nils's father, who was a poor charcoal-burner, could never afford to make his son
                    such a present, even if he worked until he was as black as a chimney-sweep. For
                    what little money he earned was needed at once for food and clothes for the
                    family; and there were times when they were obliged to mix ground birch-bark
                    with their flour in order to make it last longer. </p>
                <p>It was easy enough for a rich man's son to be good, Nils thought. It was small
                    credit to him if he was not envious, having never known want and never gone to
                    bed on birch-bark porridge. But for a poor boy not to covet all the nice things
                    which would make life so pleasant, if he had them, seemed next to impossible. </p>
                <p>Still Nils kept on making good resolutions and 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0090"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0091"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0092" n="63"/>breaking them, and then piecing them together again and breaking
                    them anew. </p>
                <p>If it had not been for his desire to see the Hulder and the Nixy, and making them
                    promise the fulfilment of the three wishes, he would have given up the struggle,
                    and resigned himself to being a bad boy because he was born so. But those
                    teasing glimpses of the Hulder's scarlet bodice and golden hair, and the vague
                    snatches of wondrous melody that rose from the cataract in the silent summer
                    nights, filled his soul with an intense desire to see the whole Hulder, with her
                    radiant smile and melancholy eyes, and to hear the whole melody plainly enough
                    to be written down on paper and learned by heart. </p>
                <p>It was with this longing to repeat the few haunting notes that hummed in his
                    brain that Nils went to the schoolmaster one day and asked him for the loan of
                    his fiddle. But the schoolmaster, hearing that Nils could not play, thought his
                    request a foolish one and refused. </p>
                <p>Nevertheless, that visit became an important event, and a turning-point in the
                    boy's life. For he was moved to confide in the schoolmaster, who was a kindly
                    old man, and fond of clever boys; and he became interested in Nils. Though he
                    regarded Nils's desire to record the Nixy's strains as absurd, he offered to
                    teach him to play. There was good stuff in the lad, he thought, and when he had
                    outgrown <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0093" n="64"/> his fantastic nonsense, he might, very likely, make a good
                    fiddler. </p>
                <p>Thus it came to pass that the charcoal-burner's son learned to play the violin.
                    He had not had half a dozen lessons before he set about imitating the Nixy's
                    notes which he had heard in the waterfall. </p>
                <p>"It was this way," he said to the schoolmaster, pressing his ear against the
                    violin, while he ran the bow lightly over the strings; "or rather it was this
                    way," making another ineffectual effort. "No, no, that wasn't it, either. It's
                    no use, schoolmaster: I shall never be able to do it!" he cried, flinging the
                    violin on the table and rushing out of the door. </p>
                <p>When he returned the next day he was heartily ashamed of his impatience. To try
                    to catch the Nixy's notes after half a dozen lessons was, of course, an
                    absurdity. </p>
                <p>The master told him simply to banish such folly from his brain, to apply himself
                    diligently to his scales, and not to bother himself about the Nixy. </p>
                <p>That seemed to be sound advice and Nils accepted it with contrition. He
                    determined never to repeat his silly experiment. But when the next midsummer
                    night came, a wild yearning possessed him, and he stole out noiselessly into the
                    forest, and sat down on a stone by the river, listening intently. </p>
                <p>For a long while he heard nothing but the monotonous boom of the water plunging
                    into the deep But, strangely enough, there was a vague, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002438_0094"  n="65"/> hushed
                    rhythm in this thundering roar; and after a while he seemed to hear a faint
                    strain, ravishingly sweet, which vibrated on the air for an instant and
                    vanished. </p>
                <p>It seemed to steal upon his ear unawares, and the moment he listened, with a
                    determination to catch it, it was gone. But sweet it was&mdash;inexpressibly
                    sweet. </p>
                <p>Let the master talk as much as he liked, catch it he would and catch it he must.
                    But he must acquire greater skill before he would be able to render something so
                    delicate and elusive. </p>
                <p>Accordingly Nils applied himself with all his might and main to his music, in the
                    intervals between his work. </p>
                <p>He was big enough now to accompany his father to the woods, and help him pile
                    turf and earth on the heap of logs that were to be burned to charcoal. He did
                    not see the Hulder face to face, though he was constantly on the watch for her;
                    but once or twice he thought he saw a swift flash of scarlet and gold in the
                    underbrush, and again and again he thought he heard her soft, teasing laughter
                    in the alder copses. That, too, he imagined he might express in music; and the
                    next time he got hold of the schoolmaster's fiddle he quavered away on the
                    fourth string, but produced nothing that had the remotest resemblance to melody,
                    much less to that sweet laughter. <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0095"  n="66"/>
                </p>
                <p>He grew so discouraged that he could have wept. He had a wild impulse to break
                    the fiddle, and never touch another as long as he lived. But he knew he could
                    not live up to any such resolution. The fiddle was already too dear to him to be
                    renounced for a momentary whim. But it was like an unrequited affection, which
                    brought as much sorrow as joy. </p>
                <p>There was so much that Nils burned to express; but the fiddle refused to obey
                    him, and screeched something utterly discordant, as it seemed, from sheer
                    perversity. </p>
                <p>It occurred to Nils again, that unless the Nixy took pity on him and taught him
                    that marvellous, airy strain he would never catch it. Would he then ever be good
                    enough to win the favor of the Nixy? </p>
                <p>For in the fairy tales it is always the bad people who come to grief, while the
                    good and merciful ones are somehow rewarded. </p>
                <p>It was evidently because he was yet far from being good enough that both Hulder
                    and Nixy eluded him. Sunday child though he was, there seemed to be small chance
                    that he would ever be able to propound his three wishes. </p>
                <p>Only now, the third wish was no longer a five-bladed pocket-knife, but a violin
                    of so fine a ring and delicate modulation that it might render the Nixy's
                    strain. <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0096" n="67"/>
                </p>
                <p>While these desires and fancies fought in his heart, Nils grew to be a young man;
                    and he still was, what he had always been&mdash;a charcoal-burner. He went
                    to the parson for half a year to prepare for confirmation; and by his gentleness
                    and sweetness of disposition attracted not only the good man himself, but all
                    with whom he came in contact. His answers were always thoughtful, and betrayed a
                    good mind. </p>
                <p>He was not a prig, by any means, who held aloof from sport and play; he could
                    laugh with the merriest, run a race with the swiftest, and try a wrestling match
                    with the strongest. </p>
                <p>There was no one among the candidates for confirmation, that year, who was so
                    well liked as Nils. Gentle as he was and soft-spoken, there was a manly spirit
                    in him, and that always commands respect among boys. </p>
                <p>He received much praise from the pastor, and no one envied him the kind words
                    that were addressed to him; for every one felt that they were deserved. But the
                    thought in Nils's mind during all the ceremony in the church and in the
                    parsonage was this: </p>
                <p>"Now, perhaps, I shall be good enough to win the Nixy's favor. Now I shall catch
                    the wondrous strain." </p>
                <p>It did not occur to him, in his eagerness, that such a reflection was out of
                    place in church; nor was it, <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0097" n="68"/> perhaps, for the Nixy's strain was
                    constantly associated in his mind with all that was best in him; with his
                    highest aspirations, and his constant strivings for goodness and nobleness in
                    thought and deed. </p>
                <p>It happened about this time that the old schoolmaster died, and in his will it
                    was found that he had bequeathed his fiddle to Nils. He had very little else to
                    leave, poor fellow; but if he had been a Cr&oelig;sus he could not have
                    given his favorite pupil anything that would have delighted him more. </p>
                <p>Nils played now early and late, except when he was in the woods with his father.
                    His fame went abroad through all the valley as the best fiddler in seven
                    parishes round, and people often came from afar to hear him. There was a
                    peculiar quality in his playing&mdash;something strangely appealing, that
                    brought the tears to one's eyes&mdash;yet so elusive that it was impossible
                    to repeat or describe it. </p>
                <p>It was rumored among the villagers that he had caught the Nixy's strain, and that
                    it was that which touched the heart so deeply in his improvisations. But Nils
                    knew well that he had not caught the Nixy's strain; though a faint
                    echo&mdash;a haunting undertone&mdash;of that vaguely remembered snatch
                    of melody, heard now and then in the water's roar, would steal at times into his
                    music, when he was, perhaps, himself least aware of it. </p>
                <p>Invitations now came to him from far and wide <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0098" n="69"/> to play at wedding and
                    dancing parties and funerals. There was no feast complete without Nils; and soon
                    this strange thing was noticed, that quarrels and brawls, which in those days
                    were common enough in Norway, were rare wherever Nils played. </p>
                <p>It seemed as if his calm and gentle presence called forth all that was good in
                    the feasters and banished whatever was evil. Such was his popularity that he
                    earned more money by his fiddling in a week than his father had ever done by
                    charcoal-burning in a month. </p>
                <p>A half-superstitious regard for him became general among the people; first,
                    because it seemed impossible that any man could play as he did without the aid
                    of some supernatural power; and secondly, because his gentle demeanor and
                    quaint, terse sayings inspired them with admiration. It was difficult to tell by
                    whom the name, Wise Nils, was first started, but it was felt by all to be
                    appropriate, and it therefore clung to the modest fiddler, in spite of all his
                    protests. </p>
                <p>Before he was twenty-five years old it became the fashion to go to him and
                    consult him in difficult situations; and though he long shrank from giving
                    advice, his reluctance wore away, when it became evident to him that he could
                    actually benefit the people. </p>
                <p>There was nothing mysterious in his counsel. All he said was as clear and
                    rational as the daylight. <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0099" n="70"/> But the good folk were nevertheless
                    inclined to attribute a higher authority to him; and would desist from vice or
                    folly for his sake, when they would not for their own sake. It was odd, indeed:
                    this Wise Nils, the fiddler, became a great man in the valley, and his renown
                    went abroad and brought him visitors, seeking his counsel, from distant
                    parishes. Rarely did anyone leave him disappointed, or at least without being
                    benefited by his sympathetic advice. </p>
                <p>One summer, during the tourist season, a famous foreign musician came to Norway,
                    accompanied by a rich American gentleman. While in his neighborhood, they heard
                    the story of the rustic fiddler, and became naturally curious to see him. </p>
                <p>They accordingly went to his cottage, in order to have some sport with him, for
                    they expected to find a vain and ignorant charlatan, inflated by the flattery of
                    his more ignorant neighbors. But Nils received them with a simple dignity which
                    quite disarmed them. They had come to mock; they stayed to admire. This
                    peasant's artless speech, made up of ancient proverbs and shrewd common-sense,
                    and instinct with a certain sunny beneficence, impressed them wonderfully. </p>
                <p>And when, at their request, he played some of his improvisations, the renowned
                    musician exclaimed that here was, indeed, a great artist lost to the world. In
                    spite of the poor violin, there was a <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0100" n="71"/> marvellously touching quality
                    in the music; something new and alluring which had never been heard before. </p>
                <p>But Nils himself was not aware of it. Occasionally, while he played, the Nixy's
                    haunting strain would flit through his brain, or hover about it, where he could
                    feel it, as it were, but yet be unable to catch it. This was his
                    regret&mdash;his constant chase for those elusive notes that refused to be
                    captured. </p>
                <p>But he consoled himself many a time with the reflection that it was the fiddle's
                    fault, not his own. With a finer instrument, capable of rendering more delicate
                    shades of sound, he might yet surprise the Nixy's strain, and record it
                    unmistakably in black and white. </p>
                <p>The foreign musician and his American friend departed, but returned at the end of
                    two weeks. They then offered to accompany Nils on a concert tour through all the
                    capitals of Europe and the large cities of America, and to insure him a sum of
                    money which fairly made him dizzy. </p>
                <p>Nils begged for time to consider, and the next day surprised them by declining
                    the startling offer. </p>
                <p>He was a peasant, he said, and must remain a peasant. He belonged here in his
                    native valley, where he could do good, and was happy in the belief that he was
                    useful. </p>
                <p>Out in the great world, of which he knew nothing, <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0101" n="72"/> he might indeed
                    gather wealth, but he might lose his peace of mind, which was more precious than
                    wealth. He was content with a moderate prosperity, and that he had already
                    attained. He had enough, and more than enough, to satisfy his modest wants, and
                    to provide those who were dear to him with reasonable comfort in their present
                    condition of life. </p>
                <p>The strangers were amazed at a man's thus calmly refusing a fortune that was
                    within his easy grasp, for they did not doubt that Nils, with his entirely
                    unconventional manner of playing, and yet with that extraordinary moving quality
                    in his play, would become the rage both in Europe and America, as a kind of
                    heaven-born, untutored genius, and fill both his own pockets and theirs with
                    shekels. </p>
                <p>They made repeated efforts to persuade him, but it was all in vain. With smiling
                    serenity, he told them that he had uttered his final decision. They then took
                    leave of him, and a month after their departure there arrived from Germany a box
                    addressed to Nils. He opened it with some trepidation, and it was found to
                    contain a Cremona violin &mdash;a genuine Stradivarius. </p>
                <p>The moment Nils touched the strings with the bow, a thrill of rapture went
                    through him, the like of which he had never experienced. The divine sweetness
                    and purity of the tone that vibrated through those magic chambers resounded
                    through <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0102" n="73"/> all his being, and made him feel happy and exalted. </p>
                <p>It occurred to him, while he was coaxing the intoxicating music from his
                    instrument, that tonight would be midsummer night. Now was his chance to catch
                    the Nixy's strain, for this exquisite violin would be capable of rendering the
                    very chant of the archangels in the morning of time. </p>
                <p>To-night he would surprise the Nixy, and the divine strain should no more drift
                    like a melodious mist through his brain; for at midsummer night the Nixy always
                    plays the loudest, and then, if ever, is the time to learn what he felt must be
                    the highest secret of the musical art. </p>
                <p>Hugging his Stradivarius close to his breast, to protect it from the damp
                    night-air, Nils hurried through the birch woods down to the river. The moon was
                    sailing calmly through a fleecy film of cloud, and a light mist hovered over the
                    tops of the forest. </p>
                <p>The fiery afterglow of the sunset still lingered in the air, though the sun had
                    long been hidden, but the shadows of the trees were gaunt and dark, as in the
                    light of the moon. </p>
                <p>The sound of the cataract stole with a whispering rush through the underbrush,
                    for the water was low at midsummer, and a good deal of it was diverted to the
                    mill, which was working busily away, with its big water-wheel going round and
                    round. <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0103" n="74"/>
                </p>
                <p>Nils paused close to the mill, and peered intently into the rushing current; but
                    nothing appeared. Then he stole down to the river-bank, where he seated himself
                    on a big stone, barely out of reach of the spray, which blew in gusts from the
                    cataract. He sat for a long while motionless, gazing with rapt intentness at the
                    struggling, foaming rapids, but he saw or heard nothing. </p>
                <p>Then all of a sudden it seemed to him that the air began to vibrate faintly with
                    a vague, captivating rhythm. Nils could hear his heart beat in his throat. With
                    trembling eagerness he unwrapped the violin and raised it to his chin. </p>
                <p>Now, surely, there was a note. It belonged on the <hi rend="italic">A</hi>
                    string. No, not there. On the <hi rend="italic">E</hi> string, perhaps. But no,
                    not there, either. </p>
                <p>Look! What is that? </p>
                <p>A flash, surely, through the water of a beautiful naked arm. </p>
                <p>And there&mdash;no, not there&mdash;but somewhere from out of the gentle
                    rush of the middle current there seemed to come to him a marvellous mist of
                    drifting sound&mdash;ineffably, rapturously sweet! </p>
                <p>With a light movement Nils runs his bow over the strings, but not a ghost, not a
                    semblance, can he reproduce of the swift, scurrying flight of that wondrous
                    melody. Again and again he listens breathlessly, and again and again despair
                    overwhelms him. <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0104" n="75"/>
                </p>
                <p>Should he, then, never see the Nixy, and ask the fulfilment of his three wishes? </p>
                <p>Curiously enough, those three wishes which once were so great a part of his life
                    had now almost escaped him. It was the Nixy's strain he had been intent upon,
                    and the wishes had lapsed into oblivion. </p>
                <p>And what were they, really, those three wishes, for the sake of which he desired
                    to confront the Nixy? </p>
                <p>Well, the first&mdash;the first was&mdash;what was it, now? Yes, now at
                    length he remembered. The first was wisdom. </p>
                <p>Well, the people called him Wise Nils now, so, perhaps, that wish was
                    superfluous. Very likely he had as much wisdom as was good for him. At all
                    events, he had refused to acquire more by going abroad to acquaint himself with
                    the affairs of the great world. </p>
                <p>Then the second wish; yes, he could recall that. It was fame. It was odd indeed;
                    that, too, he had refused, and what he possessed of it was as much, or even far
                    more, than he desired. But when he called to mind the third and last of his
                    boyish wishes, a moderate prosperity or a good violin&mdash;for that was the
                    alternative&mdash;he had to laugh outright, for both the violin and the
                    prosperity were already his. </p>
                <p>Nils lapsed into deep thought, as he sat there in <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0105" n="76"/> the summer night,
                    with the crowns of the trees above him and the brawling rapids swirling about
                    him. </p>
                <p>Had not the Nixy bestowed upon him her best gift already in permitting him to
                    hear that exquisite ghost of a melody, that shadowy, impalpable strain, which
                    had haunted him these many years? In pursuing that he had gained the goal of his
                    desires, till other things he had wished for had come to him unawares, as it
                    were, and almost without his knowing it. And now what had he to ask of the Nixy,
                    who had blessed him so abundantly? </p>
                <p>The last secret, the wondrous strain, forsooth, that he might imprison it in
                    notes, and din it in the ears of an unappreciative multitude! Perhaps it were
                    better, after all, to persevere forever in the quest, for what would life have
                    left to offer him if the Nixy's strain was finally caught, when all were finally
                    attained, and no divine melody haunted the brain, beyond the powers even of a
                    Stradivarius to lure from its shadowy realm? </p>
                <p>Nils walked home that night plunged in deep meditation. He vowed to himself that
                    he would never more try to catch the Nixy's strain. But the next day, when he
                    seized the violin, there it was again, and, strive as he might, he could not
                    forbear trying to catch it. </p>
                <p>Wise Nils is many years older now; has a good wife and several children, and is a
                    happy man; but <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0106" n="77"/> to this day, resolve as he will, he has never been
                    able to abandon the effort to catch the Nixy's strain. Sometimes he thinks he
                    has half caught it, but when he tries to play it, it is always gone.</p>

                    <p>A VERY common belief in Norway, as in many other lands, is that the seventh
                        child of the seventh child can heal the sick by the laying on of hands. Such
                        a child is therefore called a wonder child. Little Carina Holt was the
                        seventh in a family of eight brothers and sisters, but she grew to be six
                        years old before it became generally known that she was a wonder child. Then
                        people came from afar to see her, bringing their sick with them; and morning
                        after morning, as Mrs. Holt rolled up the shades, she found invalids, seated
                        or standing in the snow, gazing with devout faith and anxious longing toward
                        Carina's window. </p>
                    <p>It seemed a pity to send them away uncomforted, when the look and the touch
                        cost Carina so little. But there was another fear that arose in the mother's
                        breast, and that was lest her child should be harmed by the veneration with
                        which she was regarded, and perhaps come to believe that she was something
                        more than a common mortal. What <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0108" n="79"/> was more natural than that a
                        child who was told by grown-up people that there was healing in her touch,
                        should at last come to believe that she was something apart and
                        extraordinary? </p>
                    <p>It would have been a marvel, indeed, if the constant attention she attracted,
                        and the pilgrimages that were made to her, had failed to make any impression
                        upon her sensitive mind. Vain she was not, and it would have been unjust to
                        say that she was spoiled. She had a tender nature, full of sympathy for
                        sorrow and suffering. She was constantly giving away her shoes, her
                        stockings, nay, even her hood and cloak, to poor little invalids, whose
                        misery appealed to her merciful heart. It was of no use to scold her; you
                        could no more prevent a stream from flowing than Carina from giving. It was
                        a spontaneous yielding to an impulse that was too strong to be resisted. </p>
                    <p>But to her father there was something unnatural in it; he would have
                        preferred to have her frankly selfish, as most children are, not because he
                        thought it lovely, but because it was childish and natural. Her unusual
                        goodness gave him a pang more painful than ever the bad behavior of her
                        brothers had occasioned. On the other hand, it delighted him to see her do
                        anything that ordinary children did. He was charmed if she could be induced
                        to take part in a noisy romp, play tag, or dress her dolls. But there
                        followed usually after each outbreak of <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0109" n="80"/> natural mirth a shy
                        withdrawal into herself, a resolute and quiet retirement, as if she, were a
                        trifle ashamed of her gayety. There was nothing morbid in these moods, no
                        brooding sadness or repentance, but a touching solemnity, a serene, almost
                        cheerful seriousness, which in one of her years seemed strange. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Holt had many a struggle with himself as to how he should treat Carina's
                        delusion; and he made up his mind, at last, that it was his duty to do
                        everything in his power to dispel and counteract it. When he happened to
                        overhear her talking to her dolls one day, laying her hands upon them, and
                        curing them of imaginary diseases, he concluded it was high time for him to
                        act. He called Carina to him, remonstrated kindly with her, and forbade her
                        henceforth to see the people who came to her for the purpose of being cured.
                        But it distressed him greatly to see how reluctantly she consented to obey
                        him. </p>
                    <p>When Carina awoke the morning after this promise had been extorted from her,
                        she heard the dogs barking furiously in the yard below. Her elder sister,
                        Agnes, was standing half dressed before the mirror, holding the end of one
                        blond braid between her teeth, while tying the other with a pink ribbon.
                        Seeing that Carina was awake, she gave her a nod in the glass, and, removing
                        her braid, observed that <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0110" n="81"/> there evidently were sick pilgrims
                        under the window. She could sympathize with Sultan and Hector, she averred,
                        in their dislike of pilgrims. </p>
                    <p>"Oh, I wish they would not come!" sighed Carina. "It will be so hard for me
                        to send them away." </p>
                    <p>"I thought you liked curing people," exclaimed Agnes. </p>
                    <p>"I do, sister, but papa has made me promise never to do it again." </p>
                    <p>She arose and began to dress, her sister assisting her, chatting all the
                        while like a gay little chirruping bird that neither gets nor expects an
                        answer. She was too accustomed to Carina's moods to be either annoyed or
                        astonished; but she loved her all the same, and knew that her little ears
                        were wide open, even though she gave no sign of listening. </p>
                    <p>Carina had just completed her simple toilet when Guro, the chamber-maid,
                        entered, and announced that there were some sick folk below who wished to
                        see the wonder child. </p>
                    <p>"Tell them I cannot see them," answered Carina, with a tremulous voice; "papa
                        does not permit me." </p>
                    <p>"But this man, Atle Pilot, has come from so far away in this dreadful cold,"
                        pleaded Guro, "and his son is so very bad, poor thing; he's lying down in
                        the boat, and he sighs and groans fit to move a stone." <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0111" n="82"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Don't! Don't tell her that," interposed Agnes, motioning to the girl to
                        begone. "Don't you see it is hard enough for her already?" </p>
                    <p>There was something in the air, as the two sisters descended the stairs hand
                        in hand, which foreboded calamity. The pastor had given out from the pulpit
                        last Sunday that he would positively receive no invalids at his house; and
                        he had solemnly charged every one to refrain from bringing their sick to his
                        daughter. He had repeated this announcement again and again, and he was now
                        very much annoyed at his apparent powerlessness to protect his child from
                        further imposition. Loud and angry speech was heard in his office, and a
                        noise as if the furniture were being knocked about. The two little girls
                        remained standing on the stairs, each gazing at the other's frightened face.
                        Then there was a great bang, and a stalwart, elderly sailor came tumbling
                        head foremost out into the hall. His cap was flung after him through the
                        crack of the door. Agnes saw for an instant her father's face, red and
                        excited; and in his bearing there was something wild and strange, which was
                        so different from his usual gentle and dignified appearance. The sailor
                        stood for a while bewildered, leaning against the wall; then he stooped
                        slowly and picked up his cap. But the moment he caught sight of Carina his
                        embarrassment vanished, and his rough features were illuminated with an
                        intense emotion. <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0112" n="83"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Come, little miss, and help me," he cried, in a hoarse, imploring whisper.
                        "Halvor, my son&mdash;he is the only one God gave me&mdash;he is
                        sick; he is going to die, miss, unless you take pity on him." </p>
                    <p>"Where is he?" asked Carina. </p>
                    <p>"He's down in the boat, miss, at the pier. But I'll carry him up to you, if
                        you like. We have been rowing half the night in the cold, and he is very
                        low." </p>
                    <p>"No, no; you mustn't bring him here," said Agnes, seeing by Carina's face
                        that she was on the point of yielding. "Father would be so angry." </p>
                    <p>"He may kill me if he likes," exclaimed the sailor, wildly. "It doesn't
                        matter to me. But Halvor he's the only one I have, miss, and his mother died
                        when he was born, and he is young, miss, and he will have many years to
                        live, if you'll only have mercy on him." </p>
                    <p>"But, you know, I shouldn't dare, on papa's account, to have you bring him
                        here," began Carina, struggling with her tears. </p>
                    <p>"Ah, yes! Then you will go to him. God bless you for that!" cried the poor
                        man, with agonized eagerness. And interpreting the assent he read in
                        Carina's eye, he caught her up in his arms, snatched a coat from a peg in
                        the wall, and wrapping her in it, tore open the door. Carina made no outcry,
                        and was not in the least afraid. She felt herself resting in two strong
                        arms, warmly wrapped and borne away <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0113" n="84"/> at a great speed over the
                        snow. But Agnes, seeing her sister vanish in that sudden fashion, gave a
                        scream which called her father to the door. </p>
                    <p>"What has happened?" he asked. "Where is Carina?" </p>
                    <p>"That dreadful Atle Pilot took her and ran away with her." </p>
                    <p>"Ran away with her?" cried the pastor in alarm. "How? Where?" </p>
                    <p>"Down to the pier." </p>
                    <p>It was a few moments' work for the terrified father to burst open the door,
                        and with his velvet skull-cap on his head, and the skirts of his
                        dressing-gown flying wildly about him, rush down toward the beach. He saw
                        Atle Pilot scarcely fifty feet in advance of him, and shouted to him at the
                        top of his voice. But the sailor only redoubled his speed, and darted out
                        upon the pier, hugging tightly to his breast the precious burden he carried.
                        So blindly did he rush ahead that the pastor expected to see him plunge
                        headlong into the icy waves. But, as by a miracle, he suddenly checked
                        himself, and grasping with one hand the flag-pole, swung around it, a foot
                        or two above the black water, and regained his foothold upon the planks. He
                        stood for an instant irresolute, staring down into a boat which lay moored
                        to the end of the pier. What he saw resembled a big bundle, consisting of a
                        sheepskin coat and a couple of horse blankets. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0114" n="85"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Halvor," he cried, with a voice that shook with emotion, "I have brought
                        her." </p>
                    <p>There was presently a vague movement under the horse-blankets, and after a
                        minute's struggle a pale yellowish face became visible. It was a young face
                        &mdash;the face of a boy of fifteen or sixteen. But, oh, what suffering
                        was depicted in those sunken eyes, those bloodless, cracked lips, and the
                        shrunken yellow skin which clung in premature wrinkles about the emaciated
                        features! An old and worn fur cap was pulled down over his ears, but from
                        under its rim a few strands of blond hair were hanging upon his forehead. </p>
                    <p>Atle had just disentangled Carina from her wrappings, and was about to
                        descend the stairs to the water when a heavy hand seized him by the
                        shoulder, and a panting voice shouted in his ear: </p>
                    <p>"Give me back my child." </p>
                    <p>He paused, and turned his pathetically bewildered face toward the pastor.
                        "You wouldn't take him from me, parson," he stammered, helplessly; "no, you
                        wouldn't. He's the only one I've got." </p>
                    <p>"I don't take him from you," the parson thundered, wrathfully. "But what
                        right have you to come and steal my child, because yours is ill?" </p>
                    <p>"When life is at stake, parson," said the pilot, imploringly, "one gets
                        muddled about right and wrong. I'll do your little girl no harm. Only let
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0115" n="86"/> her lay her blessed hands upon my poor boy's head, and he
                        will be well." </p>
                    <p>"I have told you no, man, and I must put a stop to this stupid idolatry,
                        which will ruin my child, and do you no good. Give her back to me, I say, at
                        once." </p>
                    <p>The pastor held out his hand to receive Carina, who stared at him with large
                        pleading eyes out of the grizzly wolf-skin coat. </p>
                    <p>"Be good to him, papa," she begged. "Only this once." </p>
                    <p>"No, child; no parleying now; come instantly." </p>
                    <p>And he seized her by main force, and tore her out of the pilot's arms. But to
                        his dying day he remembered the figure of the heart-broken man, as he stood
                        outlined against the dark horizon, shaking his clinched fists against the
                        sky, and crying out, in a voice of despair: </p>
                    <p>"May God show you the same mercy on the Judgment Day as you have shown to
                        me!"</p>

                    <p>Six miserable days passed. The weather was stormy, and tidings of shipwreck
                        and calamity filled the air. Scarcely a visitor came to the parsonage who
                        had not some tale of woe to relate. The pastor, who was usually so gentle
                        and cheerful, wore a dismal <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0116" n="87"/> face, and it was easy to see that
                        something was weighing on his mind. </p>
                    <p>"May God show you the same mercy on the Judgment Day as you have shown to
                        me!" </p>
                    <p>These words rang constantly in his ears by night and by day. Had he not been
                        right, according to the laws of God and man, in defending his household
                        against the assaults of ignorance and superstition? Would he have been
                        justified in sacrificing his own child, even if he could thereby save
                        another's? And, moreover, was it not all a wild, heathenish delusion, which
                        it was his duty as a servant of God to stamp out and root out at all
                        hazards? Yes, there could be no doubt of it; he had but exercised his legal
                        right. He had done what was demanded of him by laws human and divine. He had
                        nothing to reproach himself for. And yet, with a haunting persistency, the
                        image of the despairing pilot praying God for vengeance stared at him from
                        every dark corner, and in the very church bells, as they rang out their
                        solemn invitation to the house of God, he seemed to hear the rhythm and
                        cadence of the heart-broken father's imprecation. In the depth of his heart
                        there was a still small voice which told him that, say what he might, he had
                        acted cruelly. If he put himself in Atle Pilot's place, bound as he was in
                        the iron bonds of superstition, how different the case would look? He saw
                        himself, in spirit, rowing in a lonely boat through the stormy winter <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0117" 
                            n="88"/> night to his pastor, bringing his only son, who was at the
                        point of death, and praying that the pastor's daughter might lay her hands
                        upon him, as Christ had done to the blind, the halt, and the maimed. And his
                        pastor received him with wrath, nay, with blows, and sent him away
                        uncomforted. It was a hideous picture indeed, and Mr. Holt would have given
                        years of his life to be rid of it. </p>
                    <p>It was on the sixth day after Atle's visit that the pastor, sitting alone in
                        his study, called Carina to him. He had scarcely seen her during the last
                        six days, or at least talked with her. Her sweet innocent spirit would
                        banish the shadows that darkened his soul. </p>
                    <p>"Carina," he said, in his old affectionate way, "papa wants to see you. Come
                        here and let me talk a little with you." </p>
                    <p>But could he trust his eyes? Carina, who formerly had run so eagerly into his
                        arms, stood hesitating, as if she hoped to be excused. </p>
                    <p>"Well, my little girl," he asked, in a tone of apprehension, "don't you want
                        to talk with papa?" </p>
                    <p>"I would rather wait till some other time, papa," she managed to stammer,
                        while her little face flushed with embarrassment. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Holt closed the door silently, flung himself into a chair, and groaned.
                        That was a blow from where he had least expected it. The child had <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0118" 
                            n="89"/> judged him and found him wanting. His Carina, his darling, who
                        had always been closest to his heart, no longer responded to his affection!
                        Was the pilot's prayer being fulfilled? Was he losing his own child in
                        return for the one he had refused to save? With a pang in his breast, which
                        was like an aching wound, he walked up and down on the floor and marvelled
                        at his own blindness. He had erred indeed; and there was no hope that any
                        chance would come to him to remedy the wrong. </p>
                    <p>The twilight had deepened into darkness while he revolved this trouble in his
                        mind. The night was stormy, and the limbs of the trees without were
                        continually knocking and bumping against the walls of the house. The rusty
                        weather-vane on the roof whined and screamed, and every now and then the
                        sleet dashed against the window-panes like a handful of shot. The wind
                        hurled itself against the walls, so that the timbers creaked and pulled at
                        the shutters, banged stray doors in out-of-the-way garrets, and then, having
                        accomplished its work, whirled away over the fields with a wild and dismal
                        howl. The pastor sat listening mournfully to this tempestuous commotion.
                        Once he thought he heard a noise as of a door opening near by him, and
                        softly closing; but as he saw no one, he concluded it was his overwrought
                        fancy that had played him a trick. He seated himself again in his easy-chair
                        before the stove, which spread a dim <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0119" n="90"/> light from its
                        draught-hole into the surrounding gloom. </p>
                    <p>While he sat thus absorbed in his meditations, he was startled at the sound
                        of something resembling a sob. He arose to strike a light, but found that
                        his match-safe was empty. But what was that? A step without, surely, and the
                        groping of hands for the door-knob. </p>
                    <p>"Who is there?" cried the pastor, with a shivering uneasiness. </p>
                    <p>He sprang forward and opened the door. A broad figure, surmounted by a
                        sou'wester, loomed up in the dark. </p>
                    <p>"What do you want?" asked Mr. Holt, with forced calmness. </p>
                    <p>"I want to know," answered a gruff, hoarse voice, "if you'll come to my son
                        now, and help him into eternity?" </p>
                    <p>The pastor recognized Atle Pilot's voice, though it seemed harsher and
                        hoarser than usual. </p>
                    <p>"Sail across the fjord on a night like this?" he exclaimed. </p>
                    <p>"That's what I ask you." </p>
                    <p>"And the boy is dying, you say?" </p>
                    <p>"Can't last till morning." </p>
                    <p>"And has he asked for the sacrament?" </p>
                    <p>The pilot stepped across the threshold and entered the room. He proceeded
                        slowly to pull off his mittens; then looking up at the pastor's face, upon
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0120" n="91"/> which a vague sheen fell from the stove, he broke out: </p>
                    <p>"Will you come or will you not? You wouldn't help him to live; now will you
                        help him to die?" </p>
                    <p>The words, thrust forth with a slow, panting emphasis, hit the pastor like so
                        many blows. </p>
                    <p>"I will come," he said, with solemn resolution. "Sit down till I get ready." </p>
                    <p>He had expected some expression of gratification or thanks, for Atle well
                        knew what he had asked. It was his life the pastor risked, but this time in
                        his calling as a physician, not of bodies, but of souls. It struck him,
                        while he took leave of his wife, that there was something resentful and
                        desperate in the pilot's manner, so different from his humble pleading at
                        their last meeting. </p>
                    <p>As he embraced the children one by one, and kissed them, he missed Carina,
                        but was told that she had probably gone to the cow-stable with the
                        dairy-maid, who was her particular friend. So he left tender messages for
                        her, and, summoning Atle, plunged out into the storm. A servant walked
                        before him with a lantern, and lighted the way down to the pier, where the
                        boat lay tossing upon the waves. </p>
                    <p>"But, man," cried the pastor, seeing that the boat was empty, "where are your
                        boatmen?" </p>
                    <p>"I am my own boatman," answered Atle, gloomily. "You can hold the sheet, I
                        the tiller." <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0121" n="92"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. Holt was ashamed of retiring now, when he had given his word. But it was
                        with a sinking heart that he stepped into the frail skiff, which seemed
                        scarcely more than a nutshell upon the tempestuous deep. He was on the point
                        of asking his servant, unacquainted though he was with seamanship, to be the
                        third man in the boat; but the latter, anticipating his intention, had made
                        haste to betake himself away. To venture out into this roaring darkness,
                        with no beacon to guide them, and scarcely a landmark discernible, was
                        indeed to tempt Providence. </p>
                    <p>But by the time he had finished this reflection, the pastor felt himself
                        rushing along at a tremendous speed, and short, sharp commands rang in his
                        ears, which instantly engrossed all his attention. To his eyes the sky
                        looked black as ink, except for a dark-blue unearthly shimmer that now and
                        then flared up from the north, trembled, and vanished. By this unsteady
                        illumination it was possible to catch a momentary glimpse of a head, and a
                        peak, and the outline of a mountain. The small sail was double-reefed, yet
                        the boat careened so heavily that the water broke over the gunwale. The
                        squalls beat down upon them with tumultuous roar and smoke, as of
                        snow-drifts, in their wake; but the little boat, climbing the top of the
                        waves and sinking into the dizzy black pits between them, sped fearlessly
                        along and the pastor began to take heart. Then, with a 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0122"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0123"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0124" n="93"/>fierce cutting distinctness, came the command out of the dark. </p>
                    <p>"Pull out the reefs!" </p>
                    <p>"Are you crazy, man?" shouted the pastor. "Do you want to sail straight into
                        eternity?" </p>
                    <p>"Pull out the reefs!" The command was repeated with wrathful emphasis. </p>
                    <p>"Then we are dead men, both you and I." </p>
                    <p>"So we are, parson&mdash;dead men. My son lies dead at home, though you
                        might have saved him. So, now, parson, we are quits." </p>
                    <p>With a fierce laugh he rose up, and still holding the tiller, stretched his
                        hand to tear out the reefs. But at that instant, just as a quivering shimmer
                        broke across the sky, something rose up from under the thwart and stood
                        between them. Atle started back with a hoarse scream. </p>
                    <p>"In Heaven's name, child!" he cried. "Oh, God, have mercy upon me!" </p>
                    <p>And the pastor, not knowing whether he saw a child or a vision, cried out in
                        the same moment: "Carina, my darling! Carina, how came you here?" </p>
                    <p>It was Carina, indeed; but the storm whirled her tiny voice away over the
                        waves, and her father, folding her with one arm to his breast, while holding
                        the sheet with the other, did not hear what she answered to his fervent
                        exclamation. He only knew that her dear little head rested close to <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0125" 
                            n="94"/> his heart, and that her yellow hair blew across his face. </p>
                    <p>"I wanted to save that poor boy, papa," were the only words that met his
                        ears. But he needed no more to explain the mystery. It was Carina, who,
                        repenting of her unkindness to him, had stolen into his study, while he sat
                        in the dark, and there she had heard Atle Pilot's message. Even if this boy
                        was sick unto death, she might perhaps cure him, and make up for her
                        father's harshness. Thus reasoned the sage Carina; and she had gone secretly
                        and prepared for the voyage, and battled with the storm, which again and
                        again threw her down on her road to the pier. It was a miracle that she got
                        safely into the boat, and stowed herself away snugly under the stern thwart. </p>
                    <p>The clearing in the north gradually spread over the sky, and the storm
                        abated. Soon they had the shore in view, and the lights of the fishermen's
                        cottages gleamed along the beach of the headland. Presently they ran into
                        smoother water; a star or two flashed forth, and wide blue expanses appeared
                        here and there on the vault of the sky. They spied the red lanterns marking
                        the wharf, about which a multitude of boats lay, moored to stakes, and with
                        three skilful tacks Atle made the harbor. It was here, standing on the pier,
                        amid the swash and swirl of surging waters, that the pilot seized Carina's
                        tiny hand in his big and rough one. <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0126" n="95"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Parson," he said, with a breaking voice, "I was going to run afoul of you,
                        and wreck myself with you; but this child, God bless her! she ran us both
                        into port, safe and sound." </p>
                    <p>But Carina did not hear what he said, for she lay sweetly sleeping in her
                        father's arms.</p>

                        Norseman, and not a German or an Englishman or a Swede." </p>
                    <p>To be a Norseman appears to the Norse boy a claim to distinction. God has
                        made so many millions of Englishmen and Russians and Germans, that there can
                        be no particular honor in being one of so vast a herd; while of Norsemen He
                        has made only a small and select number, whom He looks after with special
                        care; upon whom He showers such favors as poverty and cold (with a view to
                        keeping them good and hardy), and remoteness from all the glittering
                        temptations that beset the nations in whom He takes a less paternal
                        interest. Thus at least reasons, in a dim way, the small boy in Norway; thus
                        he is taught to reason by his parents and instructors. </p>
                    <p>As for Hakon Vang, he strutted along the beach <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002438_0128" n="97"/> like a
                        turkey-cock, whenever he thought of his glorious descent from the
                        Vikings&mdash;those daring pirates that stole thrones and kingdoms, and
                        mixed their red Norse blood in the veins of all the royal families of
                        Europe. The teacher of history (who was what is called a Norse-Norseman) had
                        on one occasion, with more patriotic zeal than discretion, undertaken to
                        pick out those boys in his class who were of pure Norse descent; whose blood
                        was untainted by any foreign admixture. The delighted pride of this small
                        band made them an object of envy to all the rest of the school. Hakon, when
                        his name was mentioned, felt as if he had added a yard to his height. Tears
                        of joy started to his eyes; and to give vent to his overcharged feelings, he
                        broke into a war-whoop; for which he received five black marks and was kept
                        in at recess. </p>
                    <p>But he minded that very little; all great men, he reflected, have had to
                        suffer for their country. </p>
                    <p>What Hakon loved above all things to study&mdash;nay, the only thing he
                        loved to study&mdash;was the old <hi rend="italic">Sagas</hi>, which are
                        tales, poems, and histories of the deeds of the Norsemen in ancient times.
                        With eleven of his classmates, who were about his own age and as Norse as
                        himself, he formed a brotherhood which was called "The Sons of the Vikings."
                        They gave each other tremendously bloody surnames, in the style of the
                        Sagas&mdash;names that reeked with gore and heroism. Hakon himself
                        assumed <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0129" n="98"/> the pleasing appellation "Skull-splitter," and his
                        classmate Frithjof R&ouml;nning was dubbed <hi rend="italic"
                            >Vargr-i-Veum</hi>, which means Wolf-in-the-Temple. One Son of the
                        Vikings was known as Ironbeard, another as Erling the Lop-Sided, a third as
                        Thore the Hound, a fourth as Aslak Stone-Skull. But a serious difficulty,
                        which came near disrupting the brotherhood, arose over these very names. It
                        was felt that Hakon had taken an unfair advantage of the rest in selecting
                        the bloodiest name at the outset (before anyone else had had an opportunity
                        to choose), and there was a general demand that he should give it up and
                        allow all to draw lots for it. But this Hakon stoutly refused to do; and
                        declared that if anyone wanted his name he would have to fight for it, in
                        good old Norse fashion. </p>
                    <p>A <hi rend="italic">holm-gang</hi> or duel was then arranged; that is, a ring
                        was marked out with stones; the combatants stepped within it, and he who
                        could drive his antagonist outside of the stone ring was declared to be the
                        victor. Frithjof, who felt that he had a better claim to be named
                        Skull-Splitter than Hakon, was the first to accept the challenge; but after
                        a terrible combat was forced to bite the dust. His conqueror was, however,
                        filled with such a glowing admiration of his valor (as combatants in the
                        Sagas frequently are), that he proposed that they should swear eternal
                        friendship and foster-brotherhood, and seal their compact, according to
                        Norse custom, by the <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0130" n="99"/> ceremony called "Mingling of Blood." It is
                        needless to say that this seemed to all the boys a most delightful
                        proposition; and they entered upon the august rite with a deep sense of its
                        solemnity. </p>
                    <p>First a piece of sod, about twelve feet square, was carefully raised upon
                        wooden stakes representing spears, so as to form a green roof over the
                        foster-brothers. Then, sitting upon the black earth, where the turf had been
                        removed, they bared their arms to the shoulder, and in the presence of his
                        ten brethren, as witnesses, each swore that he would regard the other as his
                        true brother and love him and treat him as such, and avenge his death if he
                        survived him; in solemn testimony of which each drew a knife and opened a
                        vein in his arm, letting their blood mingle and flow together. Hakon,
                        however, in his heroic zeal, drove the knife into his flesh rather
                        recklessly, and when the blood had flowed profusely for five minutes, he
                        grew a trifle uneasy. Frithjof, after having bathed his arm in a neighboring
                        brook, had no difficulty in stanching the blood, but the poor
                        Skull-Splitter's wound, in spite of cold water and bandages, kept pouring
                        forth its warm current without sign of abatement. Hakon grew paler and
                        paler, and would have burst into tears, if he had not been a "Son of the
                        Vikings." It would have been a relief to him, for the moment, not to have
                        been a "Son of the Vikings." For he was terribly frightened, and thought
                        surely he was going <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0131" n="100"/> to bleed to death. The other Vikings, too,
                        began to feel rather alarmed at such a prospect; and when Erling the
                        Lop-Sided (the pastor's son) proposed that they should carry Hakon to the
                        doctor, no one made any objection. But the doctor unhappily lived so far
                        away that Hakon might die before he got there. </p>
                    <p>"Well, then," said Wolf-in-the Temple, "let us take him to old Witch-Martha.
                        She can stanch blood and do lots of other queer things." </p>
                    <p>"Yes, and that is much more Norse, too," suggested Thore the Hound; "wise
                        women learned physic and bandaged wounds in the olden time. Men were never
                        doctors." </p>
                    <p>"Yes, Witch-Martha is just the right style," said Erling the Lop-Sided down
                        in his boots; for he had naturally a shrill voice and gave himself great
                        pains to produce a manly bass. </p>
                    <p>"We must make a litter to carry the Skull-Splitter on," exclaimed Einar
                        Bowstring-Twanger (the sheriff's son); "he'll never get to Witch-Martha
                        alive if he is to walk." </p>
                    <p>This suggestion was favorably received, the boys set to work with a will, and
                        in a few minutes had put together a litter of green twigs and branches.
                        Hakon, who was feeling curiously light-headed and exhausted, allowed himself
                        to be placed upon it in a reclining position; and its swinging motion, as
                        his friends carried it along, nearly rocked him to sleep. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0132" n="101"/> The
                        fear of death was but vaguely present to his mind; but his self-importance
                        grew with every moment, as he saw his blood trickle through the leaves and
                        drop at the roadside. He appeared to himself a brave Norse warrior who was
                        being carried by his comrades from the battle-field, where he had greatly
                        distinguished himself. And now to be going, to the witch who, by magic
                        rhymes and incantations, was to stanch the ebbing stream of his
                        life&mdash;what could be more delightful?</p>

                    <p>WITCH MARTHA lived in a small lonely cottage down by the river. Very few
                        people ever went to see her in the day-time; but at night she often had
                        visitors. Mothers who suspected that their children were changelings, whom
                        the Trolds had put in the cradle, taking the human infants away; girls who
                        wanted to "turn the hearts" of their lovers, and lovers who wanted to turn
                        the hearts of the girls; peasants who had lost money or valuables and wanted
                        help to trace the thief&mdash;these and many others sought secret
                        counsel with Witch-Martha, and rarely went away uncomforted. She was an old
                        weather-beaten woman with a deeply wrinkled, smoky-brown face, and small
                        shrewd black eyes. The floor in her cottage was strewn with sand and fresh
                        juniper twigs; from the rafters under the ceiling <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0133" n="102"/> hung bunches
                        of strange herbs; and in the windows were flower-pots with blooming plants
                        in them. </p>
                    <p>Martha was stooping at the hearth, blowing and puffing at the fire under her
                        coffee-pot, when the Sons of the Vikings knocked at the door.
                        Wolf-in-the-Temple was the man who took the lead; and when Witch-Martha
                        opened the upper half of the door (she never opened both at the same time)
                        she was not a little astonished to see the Captain's son, Frithjof
                        R&ouml;nning, staring up at her with an anxious face. </p>
                    <p>"What cost thou want, lad?" she asked, gruffly; "thou hast gone astray
                        surely, and I'll show thee the way home." </p>
                    <p>"I am Wolf-in-the-Temple," began Frithjof, thrusting out his chest, and
                        raising his head proudly. </p>
                    <p>"Dear me, you don't say so!" exclaimed Martha. </p>
                    <p>"My comrade and foster-brother Skull-Splitter has been wounded; and I want
                        thee, old crone, to stanch his blood before he bleeds to death." </p>
                    <p>"Dear, dear me, how very strange!" ejaculated the Witch, and shook her aged
                        head. </p>
                    <p>She had been accustomed to extraordinary requests; but the language of this
                        boy struck her as being something of the queerest she had yet heard. </p>
                    <p>"Where is thy Skull-Splitter, lad?" she asked, looking at him dubiously. </p>
                    <p>"Right here in the underbrush," Wolf-in-the-Temple <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002438_0134" n="103"/> retorted,
                        gallantly; "stir thy aged stumps now, and thou shalt be right royally
                        rewarded." </p>
                    <p>He had learned from Walter Scott's romances that this was the proper way to
                        address inferiors, and he prided himself not a little on his jaunty
                        condescension. Imagine then his surprise when the "old crone" suddenly
                        turned on him with an angry scowl and said: </p>
                    <p>"If thou canst not keep a civil tongue in thy head, I'll bring a thousand
                        plagues upon thee, thou umnannerly boy." </p>
                    <p>By this threat Wolf-in-the-Temple's courage was sadly shaken. He knew
                        Martha's reputation as a witch, and had no desire to test in his own person
                        whether rumor belied her. </p>
                    <p>"Please, mum, I beg of you," he said, with a sudden change of tone; "my
                        friend Hakon Vang is bleeding to death; won't you please help him?" </p>
                    <p>"Thy friend Hakon Vang!" cried Martha, to whom that name was very familiar;
                        "bring him in, as quick as thou canst, and I'll do what I can for him." </p>
                    <p>Wolf-in-the-Temple put two fingers into his mouth and gave a loud shrill
                        whistle, which was answered from the woods, and presently the small
                        procession moved up to the door, carrying their wounded comrade between
                        them. The poor Skull-Splitter was now as white as a sheet, and the
                        drowsiness of his eyes and the laxness of his features showed that <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0135" 
                            n="104"/> help came none too early. Martha, in hot haste, grabbed a bag
                        of herbs, thrust it into a pot of warm water, and clapped it on the wound.
                        Then she began to wag her head slowly to and fro, and crooned, to a soft and
                        plaintive tune, words which sounded to the ears of the boys shudderingly
                        strange:</p>

                    <lg type="verse">
                        <l>"I conjure in water, I conjure in lead,</l>
                        <l> I conjure with herbs that grew o'er the dead;</l>
                        <l> I conjure with flowers that I plucked, without shoon,</l>
                        <l> When the ghosts were abroad, in the wane of the moon.</l>
                        <l> I conjure with spirits of earth and air</l>
                        <l> That make the wind sigh and cry in despair;</l>
                        <l> I conjure by him within sevenfold rings</l>
                        <l> That sits and broods at the roots of things.</l>
                        <l> I conjure by him who healeth strife,</l>
                        <l> Who plants and waters the germs of life.</l>
                        <l> I conjure, I conjure, I bid thee be still,</l>
                        <l> Thou ruddy stream, thou hast flowed thy fill!</l>
                        <l> Return to thy channel and nurture his life</l>
                        <l> Till his destined measure of years be rife."</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>She sang the last two lines with sudden energy; and when she removed her hand
                        from the wound, the blood had ceased to flow. The poor Skull-Splitter was
                        sleeping soundly; and his friends, shivering a little with mysterious fears,
                        marched up and down whispering to one another. They set a guard of honor at
                        the leafy couch of their wounded comrade; intercepted the green worms and
                        other insects that kept dropping down upon him from the <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0136" n="105"/> alder
                        branches overhead, and brushed away the flies that would fain disturb his
                        slumbers. They were all steeped to the core in old Norse heroism; and they
                        enjoyed the situation hugely. All the life about them was half blotted out;
                        they saw it but dimly. That light of youthful romance, which never was on
                        sea or land, transformed all the common things that met their vision into
                        something strange and wonderful. They strained their ears to catch the
                        meaning of the song of the birds, so that they might learn from them the
                        secrets of the future, as Sigurd the Volsung did, after he had slain the
                        dragon, Fafnir. The woods round about them were filled with dragons and
                        fabulous beasts, whose tracks they detected with the eyes of faith; and they
                        started out every morning, during the all too brief vacation, on imaginary
                        expeditions against imaginary monsters. </p>
                    <p>When at the end of an hour the Skull-Splitter woke from his slumber, much
                        refreshed, Witch-Martha bandaged his arm carefully, and Wolf-in-the Temple
                        (having no golden arm-rings) tossed her, with magnificent superciliousness,
                        his purse, which contained six cents. But she flung it back at him with such
                        force that he had to dodge with more adroitness than dignity. </p>
                    <p>"I'll get my claws into thee some day, thou foolish lad," she said, lifting
                        her lean vulture-like hand with a threatening gesture. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0137" n="106"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"No, please don't, Martha, I didn't mean anything," cried the boy, in great
                        alarm; "you'll forgive me. won't you, Martha?" </p>
                    <p>"I'll bid thee begone, and take thy foolish tongue along with thee," she
                        answered, in a mollified tone. </p>
                    <p>And the Sons of the Vikings, taking the hint, shouldered the litter once
                        more, and reached Skull-Splitter's home in time for supper.</p>

                    <p>THE Sons of the Vikings were much troubled. Every heroic deed which they
                        plotted had this little disadvantage, that they were in danger of going to
                        jail for it. They could not steal cattle and horses, because they did not
                        know what to do with them when they had got them; they could not sail away
                        over the briny deep in search of fortune or glory, because they had no
                        ships; and sail-boats were scarcely big enough for daring voyages to the
                        blooming South which their ancestors had ravaged. The precious vacation was
                        slipping away, and as yet they had accomplished nothing that could at all be
                        called heroic. It was while the brotherhood was lamenting this fact that
                        Wolf-in-the-Temple had a brilliant idea. He procured his father's permission
                        to invite his eleven companions to spend a day and a night at the Ronning
                            <hi rend="italic">s&aelig;ter</hi>, or mountain dairy, far up in <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000002438_0138" n="107"/> the highlands. The only condition Mr. Ronning made was that
                        they were to be accompanied by his man, Brumle-Knute, who was to be
                        responsible for their safety. But the boys determined privately to make
                        Brumle-Knute their prisoner, in case he showed any disposition to spoil
                        their sport. To spend a day and a night in the woods, to imagine themselves
                        Vikings, and behave as they imagined Vikings would behave, was a prospect
                        which no one could contemplate without the most delightful excitement.
                        There, far away from sheriffs and pastors and maternal supervision, they
                        might perhaps find the long-desired chance of performing their heroic deed. </p>
                    <p>It was a beautiful morning early in August that the boys started from
                        Strandholm, Mr. Ronning's estate, accompanied by Brumle-Knute. The latter
                        was a middle-aged, round-shouldered peasant, who had the habit of always
                        talking to himself. To look at him you would have supposed that he was a
                        rough and stupid fellow who would have quite enough to do in looking after
                        himself. But the fact was, that Brumle-Knute was the best shot, the best
                        climber&mdash;and altogether the most keen-eyed hunter in the whole
                        valley. It was a saying that he could scent game so well that he never
                        needed a dog; and that he could imitate to perfection the call of every game
                        bird that inhabited the mountain glens. Sweet-tempered he was not; but so
                        reliable, <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0139" n="108"/> skilful, and vigilant, and moreover so thorough a
                        woodsman, that the boys could well afford to put up with his gruff temper. </p>
                    <p>The Sons of the Vikings were all mounted on ponies; and Wolf-in-the-Temple,
                        who had been elected chieftain, led the troop. At his side rode
                        Skull-Splitter, who was yet a trifle pale after his blood-letting, but
                        brimming over with ambition to distinguish himself. They had all tied their
                        trousers to their legs with leather thongs, in order to be perfectly "Old
                        Norse;" and some of them had turned their plaids and summer overcoats inside
                        out, displaying the gorgeous colors of the lining. Loosely attached about
                        their necks and flying in the wind, these could easily serve for scarlet or
                        purple cloaks wrought on Syrian looms. Most of the boys carried also wooden
                        swords and shields, and the chief had a long <hi rend="italic">loor</hi> or
                        Alpine horn. Only the valiant Ironbeard, whose father was a military man,
                        had a real sword and a real scabbard into the bargain. Wolf-in-the-Temple,
                        and Erling the Lop-Sided, had each an old fowling-piece; and Brumle-Knute
                        carried a double-barrelled rifle. This, to be sure, was not; quite
                        historically correct; but firearms are so useful in the woods, even if they
                        are not correct, that it was resolved not to notice the irregularity; for
                        there were boars in the mountains, besides wolves and foxes and no end of
                        smaller game. <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0140" n="109"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>For an hour or more the procession rode, single file, up the steep and rugged
                        mountain-paths; but the boys were all in high spirits and enjoyed themselves
                        hugely. The mere fact that they were Vikings, on a daring foraging
                        expedition into a neighboring kingdom, imparted a wonderful zest to
                        everything they did and said. It might be foolish, but it was on that
                        account none the less delightful. They sent out scouts to watch for the
                        approach of an imaginary enemy; they had secret pass-words and signs; they
                        swore (Viking style) by Thor's hammer and by Odin's eye. They talked
                        appalling nonsense to each other with a delicious sentiment of its awful
                        blood-curdling character. It was about noon when they reached the Strandholm
                            <hi rend="italic">s&aelig;ter</hi>, which consisted of three
                        turf-thatched log-cabins or <hi rend="italic">ch&acirc;lets</hi>,
                        surrounded by a green inclosure of half a dozen acres. The wide highland
                        plain, eight or ten miles long, was bounded on the north and west by throngs
                        of snow-hooded mountain peaks, which rose, one behind another, in glittering
                        grandeur; and in the middle of the plain there were two lakes or tarns,
                        connected by a river which was milky white where it entered the lakes and
                        clear as crystal where it escaped. </p>
                    <p>"Now, Vikings," cried Wolf-in-the-Temple, when the boys had done justice to
                        their dinner, "it behooves us to do valiant deeds, and to prove ourselves
                        worthy of our fathers." <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0141" n="110"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Hear, hear," shouted Ironbeard, who was fourteen years old and had a shadow
                        of a moustache, "I am in for great deeds, hip, hip, hurrah!" </p>
                    <p>"Hold your tongue when you hear me speak," commanded the chieftain, loftily;
                        "we will lie in wait at the ford, between the two tarns, and capture the
                        travellers who pass that way. If perchance a princess from the neighboring
                        kingdom pass, on the way to her dominions, we will hold her captive until
                        her father, the king, comes to ransom her with heaps of gold in rings and
                        fine garments and precious weapons." </p>
                    <p>"But what are we to do with her when we have caught her?" asked the
                        Skull-Splitter, innocently. </p>
                    <p>"We will keep her imprisoned in the empty <hi rend="italic"
                        >s&aelig;ter</hi> hut," Wolf-in-the-Temple responded. "Now, are you
                        ready? We'll leave the horses here on the croft, until our return." </p>
                    <p>The question now was to elude Brumle-Knute's vigilance; for the Sons of the
                        Vikings had good reasons for fearing that he might interfere with their
                        enterprise. They therefore waited until Brumle-knute was invited by the
                        dairymaid to sit down to dinner. No sooner had the door closed upon his
                        stooping figure, than they stole out through a hole in the fence, crept on
                        all-fours among the tangled dwarf-birches and the big gray boulders, and
                        following close in the track of their leader, reached the ford between the
                        lakes. There they <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0142" n="111"/> observed two enormous heaps of stones known
                        as the Parson and the Deacon; for it had been the custom from immemorial
                        times for every traveller to fling a big stone as a "sacrifice" for good
                        luck upon the Parson's heap and a small stone upon the Deacon's. Behind
                        these piles of stone the boys hid themselves, keeping a watchful eye on the
                        road and waiting for their chief's signal to pounce upon unwary travellers.
                        They lay for about fifteen minutes in expectant silence, and were on the
                        point of losing their patience. </p>
                    <p>"Look here, Wolf-in-the-Temple," cried Erling the Lop-Sided, "you may think
                        this is fun, but I don't. Let us take the raft there and go fishing. The
                        tarn is simply crowded with perch and bass." </p>
                    <p>"Hold your disrespectful tongue," whispered the chief, warningly, "or I'll
                        discipline you so you'll remember it till your dying day." </p>
                    <p>"Ho, ho!" laughed the rebel, jeeringly; "big words and fat pork don't stick
                        in the throat. Wait till I get you alone and we shall see who'll be
                        disciplined." </p>
                    <p>Erling had risen and was about to emerge from his hiding-place, when suddenly
                        hoof-beats were heard, and a horse was seen approaching, carrying on its
                        back a stalwart peasant lass, in whose lap a pretty little girl of twelve or
                        thirteen was sitting. The former was clad in scarlet bodice, a black
                        embroidered skirt, and a snowy-white kerchief was <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0143" n="112"/> tied about
                        her head. Her blonde hair hung in golden profusion down over her back and
                        shoulders. The little girl was city-clad, and had a sweet and appealing
                        face. She was chattering guilelessly with her companion, asking more
                        questions than she could possibly expect to have answered. Nearer and nearer
                        they came to the great stone heaps, dreaming of no harm. </p>
                    <p>"And, Gunbj&ouml;r," the Skull-Splitter heard the little girl say, "you
                        don't really believe that there are trolds and fairies in the mountains, do
                        you?" </p>
                    <p>"Them as are wiser than I am have believed that," was Gunbj&ouml;r's
                        answer; "but we don't hear so much about the trolds nowadays as they did
                        when my granny was young. Then they took young girls into the mountain
                        and&mdash;" </p>
                    <p>Here came a wild, piercing yell, as the Sons of the Vikings rushed forward
                        from behind the rocks, and with a terrible war-whoop swooped down upon the
                        road. Wolf-in-the-Temple, who led the band, seized the horse by the bridle,
                        and flourishing his sword threateningly, addressed the frightened peasant
                        lass. </p>
                    <p>"Is this, perchance, the Princess Kunigunde, the heir to the throne of my
                        good friend, King Bj&ouml;rn the Victorious?" he asked, with a
                        magnificent air, seizing the trembling little girl by the wrist. </p>
                    <p>"Nay," Gunbj&ouml;r answered, as soon as she could find her voice, "this
                        is the Deacon's Maggie, as is going to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >s&aelig;ter</hi> with me to spend Sunday."</p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0144"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0145"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0146" n="113"/> 
                    <p>"She cannot proceed on her way," said the chieftain, decisively, "she is my
                        prisoner." </p>
                    <p>Gunbj&ouml;r, who had been frightened out of her wits by the small
                        red-and blue-cloaked men, swarming among the stones, taking them to be
                        trolds or fairies, now gradually recovered her senses. She recognized in
                        Erling the Lop-Sided the well-known features of the parson's son; and as
                        soon as she had made this discovery she had no great difficulty in
                        identifying the rest. "Never you fear, pet," she said to the child in her
                        lap, "these be bad boys as want to frighten us. I'll give them a switching
                        if they don't look out." </p>
                    <p>"The Princess Kunigunde is my prisoner until it please her noble father to
                        ransom her for ten pounds of silver," repeated Wolf-in-the-Temple, putting
                        his arm about little Maggie's waist and trying to lift her from the saddle. </p>
                    <p>"You keep yer hands off the child, or I'll give you ten pounds of thrashing,"
                        cried Gunbj&ouml;r, angrily. </p>
                    <p>"She shall be treated with the respect due to her rank," Wolf-in-the-Temple
                        proceeded, loftily. "I give King Bj&ouml;rn the Victorious three moons
                        in which to bring me the ransom." </p>
                    <p>"And I'll give you three boxes on the ear, and a cut with my whip, into the
                        bargain, if you don't let the horse alone, and take yer hands off the
                        child." </p>
                    <p>"Vikings!" cried the chief, "lay hands on her! <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002438_0147" n="114"/> Tear her from
                        the saddle! She has defied us! She deserves no mercy." </p>
                    <p>With a tremendous yell the boys rushed forward, brandishing their swords
                        above their heads, and pulled Gunbj&ouml;r from the saddle. But she held
                        on to her charge with a vigorous clutch, and as soon as her feet touched the
                        ground she began with her disengaged hand to lay about her, with her whip,
                        in a way that proved extremely unpleasant. Wolf-in-the-Temple, against whom
                        her assault was especially directed, received some bad cuts across his face,
                        and Ironbeard was driven backward into the ford, where he fell, full length,
                        and rose dripping wet and mortified. Thore the Hound got a thump in his head
                        from Gunbj&ouml;r's stalwart elbows, and Skull-Splitter, who had more
                        courage than discretion, was pitched into the water with no more ceremony
                        than if he had been a superfluous kitten. The fact was&mdash;I cannot
                        disguise it&mdash;within five minutes the whole valiant band of the Sons
                        of the Vikings were routed by that terrible switch, wielded by the intrepid
                        Gunbj&ouml;r. When the last of her foes had bitten the dust, she calmly
                        remounted her pony, and with the Deacon's Maggie in her lap rode, at a
                        leisurely pace, across the ford. </p>
                    <p>"Good-by, lads," she said, nodding her head at them over her shoulder; "ye
                        needn't be afraid. I won't tell on you."</p>

                    <p>TO have been routed by a woman was a terrible humiliation to the valiant Sons
                        of the Vikings. They were silent and moody during the evening, and sat
                        staring into the big bonfire on the <hi rend="italic">s&aelig;ter</hi>
                        green with stern and melancholy features. They had suffered defeat in
                        battle, and it behooved them to avenge it. About nine o'clock they retired
                        into their bunks in the log cabin, but no sooner was Brumle-Knute's rhythmic
                        snoring perceived than Wolf-in-the-Temple put his head out and called to his
                        comrades to meet him in front of the house for a council of war. Instantly
                        they scrambled out of their alcoves, pulled on their coats and trousers; and
                        noiselessly stole out into the night. The sun was yet visible, but a red
                        veil of fiery mist was drawn across his face; and a magic air of fairy-tales
                        and strange unreality was diffused over mountains, plains and lakes. The
                        river wound like a huge, blood-red serpent through the mountain pastures,
                        and the snow-hooded peaks blazed with fiery splendor. </p>
                    <p>The boys were quite stunned at the sight of such magnificence, and stood for
                        some minutes gazing at the landscape, before giving heed to the summons of
                        the chief. </p>
                    <p>"Comrades," said Wolf-in-the-Temple, solemnly, "what is life without honor?"
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0149" n="116"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>There was not a soul present who could answer that conundrum, and after a
                        fitting pause the chief was forced to answer it himself. </p>
                    <p>"Life without honor, comrades," he said, severely, "life&mdash;without
                        honor is&mdash;nothing." </p>
                    <p>"Hear, hear!" cried Ironbeard; "good for you, old man!" </p>
                    <p>"Silence!" thundered Wolf-in-the-Temple, "I must beg the gentlemen to observe
                        the proprieties." </p>
                    <p>This tremendous phrase rarely failed to restore order, and the flippant
                        Ironbeard was duly rebuked by the glances of displeasure which met him on
                        all sides. But in the meanwhile the chief had lost the thread of his speech
                        and could not recover it. "Vikings," he resumed, clearing his throat
                        vehemently, "we have been&mdash;that is to say&mdash;we have
                        sustained&mdash;" </p>
                    <p>"A thrashing," supplied the innocent Skull-Splitter. </p>
                    <p>But the awful stare which was fixed upon him convinced him that he had made a
                        mistake; and he shrunk into an abashed silence. "We must do something to
                        retrieve our honor," continued the chief, earnestly; "we must&mdash;take
                        steps&mdash;to to get upon our legs again," he finished, blushing with
                        embarrassment. </p>
                    <p>"I would suggest that we get upon our legs first, and take the steps
                        afterward," remarked the flippant Ironbeard, with a sly wink at Thore the
                        Hound. <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0150" n="117"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>The chief held it to be beneath his dignity to notice this interruption, and
                        after having gazed for a while in silence at the blood-red mountain peaks,
                        he continued, more at his ease: </p>
                    <p>"I propose, comrades, that we go on a bear hunt. Then, when we return with a
                        bear-skin or two, our honor will be all right; no one will dare laugh at us.
                        The brave boy-hunters will be the admiration and pride of the whole valley." </p>
                    <p>"But Brummle-Knute," observed the Skull-Splitter; "do you think he will allow
                        us to go bear-hunting?" </p>
                    <p>"What do we care whether he allows us or not?" cried Wolf-in-the-Temple,
                        scornfully; "he sleeps like a log; and I propose that we tie his hands and
                        feet before we start." </p>
                    <p>This suggestion met with enthusiastic approval, and all the boys laughed
                        heartily at the idea of Brumle-Knute waking up and finding himself tied with
                        ropes, like a calf that is carried to market. </p>
                    <p>"Now, comrades," commanded the chief, with a flourish of his sword, "get to
                        bed quickly. I'll call you at four o'clock; we'll then start to chase the
                        monarch of the mountains." </p>
                    <p>The Sons of the Vikings scrambled into their bunks with great despatch; and
                        though their beds consisted of pine twigs, covered with a coarse sheet, and
                        a bat, of straw for a pillow, they fell asleep without rocking, and slept
                        more soundly than if they <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0151" n="118"/> had rested on silken bolsters filled
                        with eiderdown. Wolf-in-the-Temple was as good as his word, and waked them
                        promptly at four o'clock; and their first task, after having filled their
                        knapsacks with provisions, was to tie Brumle-Knute's hands and feet with the
                        most cunning slip-knots, which would tighten more, the more he struggled to
                        unloose them. Ironbeard, who had served a year before the mast, was the
                        contriver of this daring enterprise; and he did it so cleverly that
                        Brumle-Knute never suspected that his liberty was being interfered with. He
                        snorted a little and rubbed imaginary cobwebs from his face; but soon lapsed
                        again into a deep, snoring unconsciousness. </p>
                    <p>The faces of the Sons of the Vikings grew very serious as they started out on
                        this dangerous expedition. There was more than one of them who would not
                        have objected to remaining at home, but who feared to incur the charge of
                        cowardice if he opposed the wishes of the rest. Wolf-in-the-Temple walked at
                        the head of the column, as they hastened with stealthy tread out of the <hi
                            rend="italic">s&aelig;ter</hi> inclosure, and steered their course
                        toward the dense pine forest, the tops of which were visible toward the
                        east, where the mountain sloped toward the valley. He carried his
                        fowling-piece, loaded with shot, in his right hand, and a powder-horn and
                        other equipments for the chase were flung across his shoulder. Erling the
                        Lop-Sided was similarly armed, and Ironbeard, glorying <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0152" n="119"/> in a
                        real sword, unsheathed it every minute and let it flash in the sun. It was a
                        great consolation to the rest of the Vikings to see these formidable
                        weapons; for they were not wise enough to know that grown-up bears are not
                        killed with shot, and that a fowling-piece is a good deal more dangerous
                        than no weapon at all, in the hands of an inexperienced hunter. </p>
                    <p>The sun, who had exchanged his flaming <hi rend="italic">robe de nuit</hi>
                        for the rosy colors of morning, was now shooting his bright shafts of light
                        across the mountain plain, and cheering the hearts of the Sons of the
                        Vikings. The air was fresh and cool; and it seemed a luxury to breathe it.
                        It entered the lungs in a pure, vivifying stream like an elixir of life, and
                        sent the blood dancing through the veins. It was impossible to mope in such
                        air; and Ironbeard interpreted the general mood when he struck up the tune:</p>

                    <lg type="verse">
                        <l>"We wander with joy on the far mountain path,</l>
                        <l> We follow the star that will guide us;"</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>but before he had finished the third verse, it occurred to the chief that
                        they were bear-hunters, and that it was very unsportsmanlike behavior to
                        sing on the chase. For all that they were all very jolly, throbbing with
                        excitement at the thought of the adventures which they were about to
                        encounter; and concealing a latent spark of fear under an excess <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0153" n="120"
                        /> of bravado. At the end of an hour's march they had reached the pine
                        forest; and as they were all ravenously hungry they sat down upon the
                        stones, where a clear mountain brook ran down the slope, and unpacked their
                        provisions. Wolf-in-the-Temple had just helped himself, in old Norse
                        fashion, to a slice of smoked ham, having slashed a piece off at random with
                        his knife, when Erling the Lop-Sided observed that that ham had a very
                        curious odor. Everyone had to test its smell; and they all agreed that it
                        did have a singular flavor, though its taste was irreproachable. </p>
                    <p>"It smells like a menagerie," said the Skull-Splitter, as he handed it to
                        Thore the Hound. </p>
                    <p>"But the bread and the biscuit smell just the same," said Thore the Hound;
                        "in fact, it is the air that smells like a menagerie." </p>
                    <p>"Boys," cried Wolf-in-the-Temple, "do you see that track in the mud?" </p>
                    <p>"Yes; it is the track of a barefooted man," suggested the innocent
                        Skull-Splitter. </p>
                    <p>Ironbeard and Erling the Lop-Sided flung themselves down among the stones and
                        investigated the tracks; and they were no longer in doubt as to where the
                        pungent wild odor came from, which they had attributed to the ham. </p>
                    <p>"Boys," said Erling, looking up with an excited face, "a she-bear with one or
                        two cubs has been here within a few minutes." <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0154" n="121"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"This is her drinking-place," said Ironbeard: "the tracks are many and
                        well-worn; if she hasn't been here this morning, she is sure to come before
                        long." </p>
                    <p>"We are in luck indeed," Wolf-in-the-Temple observed, coolly; "we needn't go
                        far for our bear. He will be coming for us." </p>
                    <p>At that moment the note of an Alpine horn was heard; but it was impossible to
                        determine how far it was away; for the echo took up the note and flung it
                        back and forth with clear and strong reverberations from mountain to
                        mountain. </p>
                    <p>"It is Brumle-Knute who is calling us," said Thore the Hound. "The dairymaid
                        must have released him. Shall we answer?" </p>
                    <p>"Never," cried the chief, proudly; "I forbid you to answer. Here we have our
                        heroic deed in sight, and I want no one to spoil it. If there is a coward
                        among us, let him take to his heels; no one shall detain him." </p>
                    <p>There were perhaps several who would have liked to accept the invitation; but
                        no one did. Skull-Splitter, by way of diversion, plumped backward into the
                        brook, and sat down in the cool pool up to his waist. But nobody laughed at
                        his mishap; because they had their minds full of more serious thoughts.
                        Wolf-in-the-Temple, who had climbed up on a big moss-grown boulder, stood,
                        gun in hand, and peered in among the bushes. <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0155" n="122"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Boys," he whispered, "drop down on your bellies&mdash;quick." </p>
                    <p>All, crowding behind a rock, obeyed, pushing themselves into position with
                        hands and feet. With wildly beating hearts the Vikings gazed up among the
                        gray wilderness of stone and underbrush, and first one, then another, caught
                        sight of something brown and hairy that came toddling down toward them, now
                        rolling like a ball of yarn, now turning a somersault, and now again pegging
                        industriously along on four clumsy paws. It was the prettiest little bear
                        cub that ever woke on its mossy lair in the woods. Now it came shuffling
                        down in a boozy way to take its morning bath. It seemed but half awake; and
                        Skull-Splitter imagined that it was a trifle cross, because its mother had
                        waked it too early. Evidently it had made no toilet as yet, for bits of moss
                        were sticking in its hair; and it yawned once or twice, and shook its head
                        disgustedly. Skull-Splitter knew so well that feeling and could sympathize
                        with the poor young cub. But Wolf-in-the-Temple, who watched it no less
                        intently, was filled with quite different emotions. Here was his heroic
                        deed, for which he had hungered so long. To shoot a bear&mdash;that was
                        a deed worthy of a Norseman. One step more&mdash;then two&mdash;and
                        then&mdash;up rose the bear cub on its hind legs and rubbed its eyes
                        with its paws. Now he had a clean shot&mdash;now or never; and pulling
                        the trigger Wolf-in-the-Temple <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0156" n="123"/> blazed away and sent a handful
                        of shot into the carcass of the poor little bear. Up jumped all the Sons of
                        the Vikings from behind their stones, and, with a shout of triumph, ran up
                        the path to where the cub was lying. It had rolled itself up into a brown
                        ball, and whimpered like a child in pain. But at that very moment there came
                        an ominous growl out of the underbrush, and a crackling and creaking of
                        branches was heard which made the hearts of the boys stand still. </p>
                    <p>"Erling," cried Wolf-in-the-Temple, "hand me your gun, and load mine for me
                        as quick as you can." </p>
                    <p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth when the head of a big brown
                        she-bear became visible among the bushes. She paused in the path, where her
                        cub was lying, turned him over with her paw, licked his face, grumbled with
                        a low soothing tone, snuffed him all over and rubbed her nose against his
                        snout. But unwarily she must have touched some sore spot; for the cub gave a
                        sharp yelp of pain and writhed and whimpered as he looked up into his
                        mother's eyes, clumsily returning her caresses. The boys, half emerged from
                        their hiding-places, stood watching this demonstration of affection not
                        without sympathy; and <reg orig="Skull-Splittter,">Skull-Splitter,</reg> for
                        one, heartily wished that the chief had not wounded the little bear. Quite
                        ignorant as he was of the nature of bears, he allowed his compassion to get
                        the better of <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0157" n="124"/> his judgment. It seemed such a pity that the
                        poor little beast should lie there and suffer with one eye put out and forty
                        or fifty bits of lead distributed through its body. It would be much more
                        merciful to put it out of its misery altogether. And accordingly when Erling
                        the Lop-Sided handed him his gun to pass on to the chief, Skull-Splitter
                        started forward, flung the gun to his cheek, and blazed away at the little
                        bear once more, entirely heedless of consequences. It was a random,
                        unskilful shot, which was about equally shared by the cub and its mother.
                        And the latter was not in a mood to be trifled with. With an angry roar she
                        rose on her hind legs and advanced against the unhappy Skull-Splitter with
                        two uplifted paws. In another moment she would give him one of her vigorous
                        "left-handers," which would probably pacify him forever. Ironbeard gave a
                        scream of terror and Thore the Hound broke down an alder-sapling in his
                        excitement. But Wolf-in-the-Temple, remembering that he had sworn
                        foster-brotherhood with this brave and foolish little lad, thought that now
                        was the time to show his heroism. Here it was no longer play, but dead
                        earnest. Down he leaped from his rock, and just as the she-bear was within a
                        foot of the Skull-Splitter, he dealt her a blow in the head with the butt
                        end of his gun which made the sparks dance before her eyes. She turned
                        suddenly toward her new assailant, growling savagely, and scratched her ear
                        with her paw. And Skull-Splitter <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0158" n="125"/> who had slipped on the
                        pine-needles and fallen, scrambled to his feet again, leaving his gun on the
                        ground, and with a few aimless steps tumbled once more into the brook.
                        Ironbeard, seeing that he was being outdone by his chief, was quick to seize
                        the gun, and rushing forward dealt the she-bear another blow, which, instead
                        of disabling her, only exasperated her further. She glared with her small
                        bloodshot eyes now at the one, now at the other boy, as if in doubt which
                        she would tackle first. It was an awful moment; one or the other might have
                        saved himself by flight, but each was determined to stand his ground.
                        Vikings could die, but never flee. With a furious growl the she-bear started
                        toward her last assailant, lifting her terrible paw. Ironbeard backed a few
                        steps, pointing his gun before him; and with benumbing force the paw
                        descended upon the gun-barrel, striking it out of his hands. </p>
                    <p>It seemed all of a sudden to the boy as if his arms were asleep up to the
                        shoulders; he had a stinging sensation in his flesh and a humming in his
                        ears, which made him fear that his last hour had come. If the bear renewed
                        the attack now he was utterly defenceless. He was not exactly afraid, but he
                        was numb all over. It seemed to matter little what became of him. </p>
                    <p>But now a strange thing happened. To his unutterable astonishment he saw the
                        she-bear drop <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0159" n="126"/> down on all-fours and vent her rage on the gun,
                        which, in a trice, was bent and broken into a dozen fragments. But in this
                        diversion she was interrupted by Wolf-in-the-Temple, who hammered away again
                        at her head with the heavy end of his weapon. Again she rose, and presented
                        two rows of white teeth which looked as if they meant business. It was the
                        chief's turn now to meet his fate; and it was the more serious because his
                        helper was disarmed and could give him no assistance. With a wildly and
                        could give him no assistance. With a wildly thumping heart he raised the
                        butt end of his gun and dashed forward, when as by a miracle a shot was
                        heard&mdash;a sharp, loud shot that rumbled away with manifold
                        reverberations among the mountains. In the same instant the huge brown bear
                        tumbled forward, rolled over, with a gasping growl, and was dead. </p>
                    <p>"O Brumle Knute! Brumle-Knute!" yelled the boys in joyous chorus, as they saw
                        their rescuer coming forward from behind the rocks, "how did you find us?" </p>
                    <p>"I heard yer shots and I saw yer tracks," said Brumle-Knute, dryly; "but when
                        ye go bear-hunting another time ye had better load with bullets instead of
                        bird-shot." </p>
                    <p>"But, Brumle-Knute, we only wanted to shoot the little bear," protested
                        Wolf-in-the-Temple. </p>
                    <p>"That may be," Brumle-Knute replied; "but the big bears, they are a curiously
                        unreasonable lot;
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0160"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0161"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0162" n="127"/> they are apt to get mad when you fire at their little ones.
                        Next time you must recollect to take the big bear into account." </p>
                    <p>I need not tell you that the Sons of the Vikings became great heroes when the
                        rumor of their bear hunt was noised abroad through the valley. But, for all
                        that, they determined to disband their brotherhood. Wolf-in-the-Temple
                        expressed the sentiment of all when, at their last meeting, he made a
                        speech, in which these words occurred: </p>
                    <p>"Brothers, the world isn't quite the same now as it was in the days when our
                        Viking forefathers spread the terror of their name through the South. We are
                        not so strong as they were, nor so hardy. When we mingle blood, we have to
                        send for a surgeon. If we steal princesses we may go to jail for
                        it&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;well&mdash;never
                        mind&mdash;what else may happen. Heroism isn't appreciated as once it
                        was in this country; and I, for one, won't try to be a hero any more. I
                        resign my chieftainship now, when I can do it with credit. Let us all make
                        our bows of adieu as bear hunters; and if we don't do anything more in the
                        heroic line it is not because we can't, but because we won't."</p>

                <head> PAUL JESPERSEN'S MASQUERADE </head>

                <p>THERE was great excitement in the little Norse town, Bumlebro, because there was
                    going to be a masquerade. Everybody was busy inventing the character which he
                    was to represent, and the costume in which he was to represent it. </p>
                <p>Miss Amelia N&ocirc;rbeck, the apothecary's daughter, had intended to be <hi
                        rend="italic">Marie Antoinette</hi>, but had to give it up because the silk
                    stockings were too dear, although she had already procured the beauty-patches
                    and the powdered wig. </p>
                <p>Miss Arctander, the judge's daughter, was to be <hi rend="italic">Night</hi>, in
                    black tulle, spangled with silver stars, and Miss Hanna Broby was to be <hi
                        rend="italic">Morning</hi>, in white tulle and pink roses. </p>
                <p>There had never <hi rend="italic">been</hi> a masquerade in Bumlebro, and there
                    would not have been one now, if it had not been for the enterprise of young
                    Arctander and young Norbeck, who had just returned from the military academy in
                    the capital, and were anxious to exhibit themselves to the young girls in their
                    glory. </p>
                <p>Of course, they could not afford to be exclusive, <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0164" n="129"/> for there were
                    but twenty or thirty families in the town that laid any claims to gentility, and
                    they had all to be invited in order to fill the hall and pay the bills. Thus it
                    came to pass that Paul Jespersen, the book-keeper in the fish-exporting firm of
                    Broby &amp; Larsen, received a card, although, to be sure, there had been a
                    long debate in the committee as to where the line should be drawn. </p>
                <p>Paul Jespersen was uncommonly elated when he read the invitation, which was
                    written on a gilt-edged card, requesting the pleasure of Mr. Jespersen's company
                    at a <hi rend="italic">bal masque</hi> Tuesday, January 3d, in the Association
                    Hall. </p>
                <p>"The pleasure of his company!" </p>
                <p>Think of it! He felt so flattered that he blushed to the tips of his ears. It
                    must have been Miss Clara Broby who had induced them to be so polite to him, for
                    those insolent cadets, who only nodded patronizingly to him in response to his
                    deferential greeting, would never have asked for "the pleasure of his company." </p>
                <p>Having satisfied himself on this point, Paul went to call upon Miss Clara in the
                    evening, in order to pay her some compliment and consult her in regard to his
                    costume; but Miss Clara, as it happened, was much more interested in her own
                    costume than in that of Mr. Jespersen, and offered no useful suggestions. </p>
                <p>"What character would you advise me to select, <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0165" n="130"/> Mr. Jespersen?" she
                    inquired, sweetly. "My sister Hanna, you know, is going to be <hi rend="italic"
                        >Morning</hi>, so I can't be that, and it seems to me <hi rend="italic"
                        >Morning</hi> would have suited me just lovely." </p>
                <p>"Go as <hi rend="italic">Beauty</hi>," suggested Mr. Jespersen, blushing at the
                    thought of his audacity. </p>
                <p>"So I will, Mr. Jespersen," she answered, laughing, "if you will go as the <hi
                        rend="italic">Beast</hi>." </p>
                <p>Paul, being a simple-hearted fellow, failed to see any sarcasm in this, but
                    interpreted it rather as a hint that Miss Clara desired his escort, as <hi
                        rend="italic">Beauty</hi>, of course, only would be recognizable in her
                    proper character by the presence of the <hi rend="italic">Beast</hi>. </p>
                <p>"I shall be delighted, bliss Clara," he said, beaming with pleasure. "If you will
                    be my <hi rend="italic">Beauty</hi>, I'll be your <hi rend="italic">Beast</hi>." </p>
                <p>Miss Clara did not know exactly how to take this, and was rather absent-minded
                    during the rest of the interview. She had been chaffing Mr. Jespersen, of
                    course, but she did not wish to be absolutely rude to him, because he was her
                    father's employee, and, as she often heard her father say, a very valuable and
                    trustworthy young man. </p>
                <p>When Paul got home he began at once to ponder upon his character as <hi
                        rend="italic">Beast</hi>, and particularly as Miss Clara's <hi rend="italic"
                        >Beast</hi>. It occurred to him that his uncle, the furrier, had an enormous
                    bear-skin, with head, eyes, claws, and all that was necessary, and without delay
                    he went to try it on. <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0166" n="131"/>
                </p>
                <p>His uncle, feeling that this event was somehow to redound to the credit of the
                    family, agreed to make the necessary alterations at a trifling cost, and when
                    the night of the masquerade arrived, Paul was so startled at his appearance that
                    he would have run away from himself if such a thing had been possible. He had
                    never imagined that he would make such a <reg orig="sucessful">successful</reg>
                    <hi rend="italic">Beast</hi>. </p>
                <p>By an ingenious contrivance with a string, which he pulled with his hand, he was
                    able to move his lower jaw, which, with its red tongue and terrible teeth,
                    presented an awful appearance. By patching the skin a little behind, his head
                    was made to fit comfortably into the bear's head, and his mild blue eyes looked
                    out of the holes from which the bear's eyes had been removed. The skin was laced
                    with thin leather thongs from the neck down, but the long, shaggy fur made the
                    lacing invisible. </p>
                <p>Paul Jespersen practiced ursine behavior before the looking-glass for about half
                    an hour. Then, being uncomfortably warm, he started down-stairs, and determined
                    to walk to the Association Hall. He chuckled to himself at the thought of the
                    sensation he would make, if he should happen to meet anybody on the road. </p>
                <p>Having never attended a masquerade before, he did not know that dressing-rooms
                    were provided for the maskers, and, being averse to needless expenditure, he
                    would as soon have thought of flying as of <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0167" n="132"/> taking a carriage.
                    There was, in fact, but one carriage on runners in the town, and that was
                    already engaged by half a dozen parties. </p>
                <p>The moon was shining faintly upon the snow, and there was a sharp frost in the
                    air when Paul Jespersen put his hairy head out of the street-door and
                    reconnoitred the territory. </p>
                <p>There was not a soul to be seen, except an old beggar woman who was hobbling
                    along, supporting herself with two sticks. Paul darted, as quickly as his
                    unwieldly bulk would allow, into the middle of the street. He enjoyed intensely
                    the fun of walking abroad in such a monstrous guise. He contemplated with boyish
                    satisfaction his shadow which stretched, long and black and horrible, across the
                    snow. </p>
                <p>It was a bit slippery, and he had to man&oelig;uvre carefully in order to
                    keep right side up. Presently he caught up with the beggar woman. </p>
                <p>"Good-evening!" he said. </p>
                <p>The old woman turned about, stared at him horror-stricken; then, as soon as she
                    had collected her senses, took to her heels, yelling at the top of her voice. A
                    big mastiff, who had just been let loose for the night, began to bark angrily in
                    a back yard, and a dozen comrades responded from other yards, and came bounding
                    into the street. </p>
                <p>"Hello!" thought Paul Jespersen. "Now look out for trouble." <pb
                    entity="DSSR_000002438_0168" n="133"/>
                </p>
                <p>He felt anything but hilarious when he saw the pack of angry dogs dancing and
                    leaping about him, barking in a wildly discordant chorus. </p>
                <p>"Why, Hector, you fool, don't you know me?" he said, coaxingly, to the judge's
                    mastiff. "And you, Sultan, old man! You ought to be ashamed of yourself! Here,
                    Caro, that's a good fellow! Come, now, don't excite yourself!" </p>
                <p>But Hector, Sultan, and Caro were all proof against such blandishments, and as
                    for Bismarck, the apothecary's collie, he grew every moment more furious, and
                    showed his teeth in a very uncomfortable fashion. </p>
                <p>To defend one's self was not to be thought of, for what defence is possible to a
                    sham bear against a dozen genuine dogs? Paul could use neither his teeth nor his
                    claws to any purpose, while the dogs could use theirs, as he presently
                    discovered, with excellent effect. </p>
                <p>He had just concluded to seek safety in flight, when suddenly he felt a bite in
                    his left calf, and saw the brute Bismarck tug away at his leg as if it had been
                    a mutton-chop. He had scarcely recovered from this surprise when he heard a
                    sharp report, and a bullet whizzed away over his head, after having neatly put a
                    hole through the right ear. Paul concluded, with reason, that things were
                    getting serious. </p>
                <p>If he could only get hold of that blockhead, the judge's groom, who was violating
                    the law about fire-arms, <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0169" n="134"/> he would give him an exhibition in
                    athletics which he would not soon forget; but, being for the moment deprived of
                    this pleasure, he knew of nothing better to do than to dodge through the nearest
                    street-door, and implore the protection of the very first individual he might
                    meet. </p>
                <p>It so happened that Paul selected the house of two middle-aged milliners for this
                    experiment. </p>
                <p>Jemina and Malla Hansen were just seated at the table drinking tea with their one
                    constant visitor, the post-office clerk, Mathias, when, all of a sudden, they
                    heard a tremendous racket in the hall, and the furious barking of dogs. </p>
                <p>With a scream of fright, the two old maids jumyed up, dropping their precious
                    tea-cups, and old Mathias, who had tipped his chair a little backward, lost his
                    balance, and pointed his heels toward the ceiling. Before he had time to pick
                    himself up the door was burst open and a great hairy monster sprang into the
                    room. </p>
                <p>"Mercy upon us!" cried Jemina. "It is the devil!" </p>
                <p>But now came the worst of it all. The bear put his paw on his heart, and with the
                    politest bow in the world, remarked: </p>
                <p>"Pardon me, ladies, if I intrude." </p>
                <p>He had meant to say more, but his audience had vanished; only the flying tails of
                    Mathias's coat were seen, as he slammed the door on them, in his precipitate
                    flight. <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0170" n="135"/>
                </p>
                <p>"Police! police!" someone shouted out of the window of the adjoining room. </p>
                <p>Police! Now, with all due respect for the officers of the law, Paul Jespersen had
                    no desire to meet them at the present moment. To be hauled up at the
                    station-house and fined for street disorder&mdash;nay, perhaps be locked up
                    for the night, if, as was more than likely, the captain of police was at the
                    masquerade, was not at all to Paul's taste. Anything rather than that! He would
                    be the laughing stock of the whole town if, after his elaborate efforts, he were
                    to pass the night in a cell, instead of dancing with Miss Clara Broby. </p>
                <p>Hearing the cry for police repeated, Paul looked about him for some means of
                    escape. It occurred to him that he had seen a ladder in the hall leading up to
                    the loft. There he could easily hide himself until the crowd had dispersed. </p>
                <p>Without further reflection, he rushed out through the door by which he had
                    entered, climbed the ladder, thrust open a trap-door, and, to his astonishment,
                    found himself under the wintry sky. </p>
                <p>The roof sloped steeply, and he had to balance carefully in order to avoid
                    sliding down into the midst of the noisy mob of dogs and street-boys who were
                    laying siege to the door. </p>
                <p>With the utmost caution he crawled along the roof-tree, trembling lest he should
                    be discovered by some lynx-eyed villain in the throng of his pursuers. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002438_0171" n="136"/> Happily, the broad brick chimney afforded him some shelter, of
                    which he was quick to take advantage. Rolling himself up into the smallest
                    possible compass, he sat for a long time crouching behind the chimney; while the
                    police were rummaging under the beds and in the closets of the house, in the
                    hope of finding him. </p>
                <p>He had, of course, carefully closed the trap-door by which he had reached the
                    comparative safety of his present position; and he could not help chuckling to
                    himself at the thought of having outwitted the officers of the law. </p>
                <p>The crowd outside, after having made night hideous by their whoops and yells,
                    began, at the end of an hour, to grow weary; and the dogs being denied entrance
                    to the house, concluded that they had no further business there, and slunk off
                    to their respective kennels. </p>
                <p>The people, too, scattered, and only a few patient loiterers hung about the
                    street door, hoping for fresh developments. It seemed useless to Paul to wait
                    until these provoking fellows should take themselves away. They were obviously
                    prepared to make a night of it, and time was no object to them. </p>
                <p>It was then that Paul, in his despair, resolved upon a daring stratagem. Mr.
                    Broby's house was in the same block as that of the Misses Hansen, only it was at
                    the other end of the block. By <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0172" n="137"/> creeping along the roof-trees of
                    the houses, which, happily, differed but slightly in height, he could reach the
                    Broby house, where, no doubt, Miss Clara was now waiting for him, full of
                    impatience. </p>
                <p>He did not deliberate long before testing the practicability of this plan. The
                    tanner Thoresen's house was reached without accident, although he barely escaped
                    being detected by a small boy who was amusing himself throwing snow-balls at the
                    chimney. It was a slow and wearisome mode of locomotion&mdash;pushing
                    himself forward on his belly; but, as long as the streets were deserted, it was
                    a pretty safe one. </p>
                <p>He gave a start whenever he heard a dog bark; for the echoes of the ear-splitting
                    concert they had given him were yet ringing in his brain. </p>
                <p>It was no joke being a bear, he thought, and if he had suspected that it was such
                    a serious business, he would not so rashly have undertaken it. But now there was
                    no way of getting out of it; for he had nothing on but his underclothes under
                    the bear-skin. </p>
                <p>At last he reached the Broby house, and drew a sigh of relief at the thought that
                    he was now at the end of his journey. </p>
                <p>He looked about him for a trap-door by which he could descend into the interior,
                    but could find none. There was an inch of snow on the roof, glazed with frost:
                    and if there was a trap-door, it was securely hidden. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002438_0173" n="138"/>
                </p>
                <p>To jump or slide down was out of the question, for he would, in that case, risk
                    breaking his neck. If he cried for help, the groom, who was always ready with
                    his gun, might take a fancy to shoot at him; and that would be still more
                    unpleasant. It was a most embarrassing situation. </p>
                <p>Paul's eyes fell upon a chimney; and the thought flashed through his head that
                    there was the solution of the difficulty. He observed that no smoke was coming
                    out of it, so that he would run no risk of being converted into smoked ham
                    during the descent. </p>
                <p>He looked down through the long, black tunnel. It was a great, spacious,
                    old-fashioned chimney, and abundantly wide enough for his purpose. </p>
                <p>A pleasant sound of laughter and merry voices came to him from the kitchen below.
                    It was evident the girls were having a frolic. So, without further ado, Paul
                    Jespersen stuffed his great hairy bulk into the chimney and proceeded to let
                    himself down. </p>
                <p>There were notches and iron rings in the brick wall, evidently put there for the
                    convenience of the chimney-sweeps; and he found his task easier than he had
                    anticipated. The soot, to be sure, blinded his eyes, but where there was nothing
                    to be seen, that was no serious disadvantage. </p>
                <p>In fact, everything was going as smoothly as possible, when suddenly he heard a
                girl's voice cry out:</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0174"/>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0175"/>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0176" n="139"/>
                <p>"Gracious goodness! what is that in the chimney?" </p>
                <p>"Probably the chimney-sweep," a man's voice answered. </p>
                <p>"Chimney-sweep at this time of night!" </p>
                <p>Paul, bracing himself against the walls, looked down and saw a cluster of anxious
                    faces all gazing up toward him. A candle which one of the girls held in her hand
                    showed him that the distance down to the hearth was but short; so, to make an
                    end of their <reg orig="uncertainy,">uncertainty,</reg> he dropped himself
                    down&mdash;quietly, as he thought, but by the force of his fall blowing the
                    ashes about in all directions. </p>
                <p>A chorus of terrified screams greeted him. One girl fainted, one leaped up on a
                    table, and the rest made for the door. </p>
                <p>And there sat poor Paul, in the ashes on the hearth, utterly bewildered by the
                    consternation he had occasioned. He picked himself up by and by, rubbed the soot
                    out of his eyes with the backs of his paws, and crawled out upon the floor. </p>
                <p>He had just managed to raise himself upon his hind-legs, when an awful apparition
                    became visible in the door, holding a candle. It was now Paul's turn to be
                    frightened. The person who stood before him bore a close resemblance to the
                    devil. </p>
                <p>"What is all this racket about?" he cried, in a tone of authority. <pb
                    entity="DSSR_000002438_0177" n="140"/>
                </p>
                <p>Paul felt instantly relieved, for the voice was that of his revered chief, Mr.
                    Broby, who, he now recollected, was to figure at the masquerade as <hi
                        rend="italic">Mephistopheles</hi>. Behind him peeped forth the faces of his
                    two daughters, one as <hi rend="italic">Morning</hi> and the other as <hi
                        rend="italic">Spring</hi>. </p>
                <p>"May I ask what is the cause of this unseemly noise?" repeated Mr. Broby,
                    advancing to the middle of the room. The light of his candle now fell upon the
                    huge bear whom, after a slight start, he recognized as a masker. </p>
                <p>"Excuse me, Mr. Broby," said Paul, "but Miss Clara did me the honor&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Oh yes, papa," Miss Clara interrupted him, stepping forth in all her glory of
                    tulle and flowers; "it is Paul Jespersen, who was going to be my <hi
                        rend="italic">Beast</hi>." </p>
                <p>"And it is you who have frightened my servants half out of their wits,
                    Jespersen?" said Mr. Broby, laughing. </p>
                <p>"He tumbled down through the chimney, sir," declared the cook, who had
                    half-recovered from her fright. </p>
                <p>"Well," said Mr. Broby, with another laugh, "I admit that was a trifle
                    unconventional. Next time you call, Jespersen, you must come through the door." </p>
                <p>He thought Jespersen had chosen to play a practical joke on the servants, and,
                    though he did not <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0178" n="141"/> exactly like it, he was in no mood for scolding.
                    After having been carefully brushed and rolled in the snow, Paul offered his
                    escort to Miss Clara; and she had not the heart to tell him that she was not at
                    all <hi rend="italic">Beauty</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">Spring</hi>. And Paul
                    was not enough of an expert to know the difference.</p>

                </head>

                <p>THE king was dead, and among the many things he left behind him which his
                    successor had no use for were a lot of fancy horses. There were long-barrelled
                    English hunters, all legs and neck; there were Kentucky racers, graceful, swift,
                    and strong; and two Arabian steeds, which had been presented to his late majesty
                    by the Sultan of Turkey. To see the beautiful beasts prancing and plunging, as
                    they were being led through the streets by grooms in the royal livery, was
                    enough to make the blood dance in the veins of any lover of horse-flesh. And to
                    think that they were being led ignominiously to the auction mart to be sold
                    under the hammer&mdash;knocked down to the highest bidder! It was a sin and
                    a shame surely! And they seemed to feel it themselves; and that was the reason
                    they acted so obstreperously, sometimes lifting the grooms off their feet as
                    they reared and snorted and struck sparks with their steel-shod hoofs from the
                    stone pavement. <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0180" n="143"/>
                </p>
                <p>Among the crowd of schoolboys who followed the equine procession, shrieking and
                    yelling with glee and exciting the horses by their wanton screams, was a
                    handsome lad of fourteen, named Erik Carstens. He had fixed his eyes admiringly
                    on a coal-black, four-year-old mare, a mere colt, which brought up the rear of
                    the procession. How exquisitely she was fashioned! How she danced over the
                    ground with a light mazurka step, as if she were shod with gutta-percha and not
                    with iron! And then she had a head so daintily shaped, small and spirited, that
                    it was a joy to look at her. Erik, who, in spite of his youth, was not a bad
                    judge of a horse, felt his heart beat like a trip-hammer, and a mighty yearning
                    took possession of him to become the owner of that mare. Though he knew it was
                    time for dinner he could not tear himself away, but followed the procession up
                    one street and down another, until it stopped at the horse market. There a lot
                    of jockeys and coarse-looking dealers were on hand; and an opportunity was
                    afforded them to try the horses before the auction began. They forced open the
                    mouths of the beautiful animals, examined their teeth, prodded them with whips
                    to see if they were gentle, and poked them with their fingers or canes. But when
                    a loutish fellow, in a brown corduroy suit, indulged in that kind of behavior
                    toward the black mare she gave a resentful whinny and without further ado
                    grabbed <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0181" n="144"/> him with her teeth by the coat collar, lifted him up and
                    shook him as if he had been a bag of straw. Then she dropped him in the mud, and
                    raised her dainty head with an air as if to say that she held him to be beneath
                    contempt. The fellow, however, was not inclined to put up with that kind of
                    treatment. With a volley of oaths he sprang up and would have struck the mare in
                    the mouth with his clinched fist, if Erik had not darted forward and warded off
                    the blow. </p>
                <p>"How dare you strike that beautiful creature?" he cried, indignantly. </p>
                <p>"Hold your jaw, you gosling, or I'll hit you instead," retorted the man. </p>
                <p>But by that time one of the royal grooms had made his appearance and the brute
                    did not dare carry out his threat. While the groom strove to quiet the mare, a
                    great tumult arose in some other part of the market-place. There was a
                    whinnying, plunging, rearing, and screaming, as if the whole field had gone mad.
                    The black mare joined in the concert, and stood with her ears pricked up and her
                    head raised in an attitude of panicky expectation. Quite fearlessly Erik walked
                    up to her, patted her on the neck and spoke soothingly to her. </p>
                <p>"Look out," yelled the groom, "or she'll trample you to jelly!" </p>
                <p>But instead of that, the mare rubbed her soft <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0182" n="145"/> nose against the
                    boy's cheek, with a low, friendly neighing, as if she wished to thank him for
                    his gallant conduct. And at that moment Erik's heart went out to that dumb
                    creature with an affection which he had never felt toward any living thing
                    before. He determined, whatever might happen, to bid on her and to buy her,
                    whatever she might prove to be worth. He knew he had a few thousand dollars in
                    the bank&mdash;his inheritance from his mother, who had died when he was a
                    baby&mdash;and he might, perhaps, be able to persuade his father to sanction
                    the purchase. At any rate, he would have some time to invent ways and means; for
                    his father, Captain Carstens, was now away on the great annual drill, and would
                    not return for some weeks. </p>
                <p>As a mere matter of form, he resolved to try the mare before bidding on her; and
                    slipping a coin into the groom's hand he asked for a saddle. It turned out,
                    however, that all the saddles were in use, and Erik had no choice but to mount
                    bareback. </p>
                <p>"Ride her on the snaffle. She won't stand the curb," shouted the groom, as the
                    mare, after plunging to the right and to the left, darted through the gate to
                    the track, and, after kicking up a vast deal of tan-bark, sped like a bullet
                    down the race-course. </p>
                <p>"Good gracious, how recklessly that boy rides!" <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0183" n="146"/> one jockey observed
                    to another; "but he has got a good grip with his knees all the same." </p>
                <p>"Yes, he sits like a daisy," the second replied, critically; "but mind my word,
                    Lady Clare will throw him yet. She never could stand anybody but the princess on
                    her back: and that was the reason her Royal Highness was so fond of her. Mother
                    of Moses, won't there be a grand rumpus when she comes back again and finds Lady
                    Clare gone! I should not like to be in the shoes of the man who has ordered Lady
                    Clare under the hammer." </p>
                <p>"But look at the lad! I told you Lady Clare wouldn't stand no manner of nonsense
                    from boys." </p>
                <p>"She is kicking like a Trojan! She'll make hash of him if he loses his seat." </p>
                <p>"Yes, but he sticks like a burr. That's a jewel of a lad, I tell ye. He ought to
                    have been a jockey." </p>
                <p>Up the track came Lady Clare, black as the ace of spades, acting like the Old
                    Harry. Something had displeased her, obviously, and she held Erik responsible
                    for it. Possibly she had just waked up to the fact that she, who had been the
                    pet of a princess, was now being ridden by an ordinary commoner. At all events,
                    she had made up her mind to get rid of the commoner without further ceremony.
                    Putting her fine ears back and dilating her nostrils, she suddenly gave a snort
                    and a whisk with her tail, and up went her heels toward the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002438_0184" n="147"/>
                    eternal stars&mdash;that is, if there had been any stars visible just then.
                    Everybody's heart stuck in his throat; for fleet-footed racers were speeding
                    round and round, and the fellow who got thrown in the midst of all these
                    trampling hoofs would have small chance of looking upon the sun again. People
                    instinctively tossed their heads up to see how high he would go before coming
                    down again; but, for a wonder, they saw nothing, except a cloud of dust mixed
                    with tan-bark, and when that had cleared away they discovered the black mare and
                    her rider, apparently on the best of terms, dashing up the track at a breakneck
                    pace. </p>
                <p>Erik was dripping with perspiration when he dismounted, and Lady Clare's glossy
                    coat was flecked with foam. She was not aware, apparently, that if she had any
                    reputation to ruin she had damaged it most effectually. Her behavior on the
                    track and her treatment of the horse-dealer were by this time common property,
                    and every dealer and fancier made a mental note that Lady Clare was the number
                    in the catalogue which he would not bid on. All her beauty and her distinguished
                    ancestry counted for nothing, as long as she had so uncertain a temper. Her
                    sire, Potiphar, it appeared, had also been subject to the same infirmities of
                    temper, and there was a strain of savagery in her blood which might crop out
                    when you least expected it. <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0185" n="148"/>
                </p>
                <p>Accordingly, when a dozen fine horses had been knocked down at good prices, and
                    Lady Clare's turn came, no one came forward to inspect her, and no one could be
                    found to make a bid. </p>
                <p>"Well, well, gentlemen," cried the auctioneer, "here we have a beautiful
                    thoroughbred mare, the favorite mount of Her Royal Highness the Princess, and
                    not a bid do I hear. She's a beauty, gentlemen, sired by the famous Potiphar who
                    won the Epsom Handicap and no end of minor stakes. Take a look at her,
                    gentlemen! Did you ever see a horse before that was raven black from nose to
                    tail? I reckon you never did. But such a horse is Lady Clare. The man who can
                    find a single white hair on her can have her for a gift. Come forward,
                    gentlemen, come forward. Who will start her&mdash;say at five hundred?" </p>
                <p>A derisive laugh ran through the crowd, and a voice was heard to cry, "Fifty." </p>
                <p>"Fifty!" repeated the auctioneer, in a deeply grieved and injured tone; "fifty
                    did you say, sir? Fifty? Did I hear rightly? I hope, for the sake of the honor
                    of this fair city, that my ears deceived me." </p>
                <p>Here came a long and impressive pause, during which the auctioneer, suddenly
                    abandoning his dramatic manner, chatted familiarly with a gentleman who stood
                    near him. The only one in the crowd whom he had impressed with the fact that <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002438_0186" n="149"/> the honor of the city was at stake in this sale was Erik Carstens.
                    He had happily discovered a young and rich lieutenant of his father's company,
                    and was trying to persuade him to bid in the mare for him. </p>
                <p>"But, my dear boy," Lieutenant Thicker exclaimed, "what do you suppose the
                    captain will say to me if I aid and abet his son in defying the paternal
                    authority?" </p>
                <p>"Oh, you needn't bother about that," Erik rejoined eagerly. "If father was at
                    home, I believe he would allow me to buy this mare. But I am a minor yet, and
                    the auctioneer would not accept my bid. Therefore I thought you might be kind
                    enough to bid for me." </p>
                <p>The lieutenant made no answer, but looked at the earnest face of the boy with
                    unmistakable sympathy. The auctioneer assumed again an insulted, affronted,
                    pathetically entreating or scornfully repelling tone, according as it suited his
                    purpose; and the price of Lady Clare crawled slowly and reluctantly up from
                    fifty to seventy dollars. There it stopped, and neither the auctioneer's tears
                    nor his prayers could apparently coax it higher. </p>
                <p>"Seventy dollars!" he cried, as if he were really too shocked to speak at all;
                    "seven-ty dollars! Make it eighty! Oh, it is a sin and a shame, gentlemen, and
                    the fair fame of this beautiful city is eternally ruined. It will become a
                    wagging of the <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0187" n="150"/> head and a byword among the nations. Sev-en-ty
                    dollars!"&mdash;then hotly and indignantly&mdash;"seventy
                    dollars!&mdash;fifth and last time, seventy dollars!"&mdash;here he
                    raised his hammer threateningly&mdash;"seventy dollars!" </p>
                <p>"One hundred!" cried a high boyish voice, and in an instant every neck was craned
                    and every eye was turned toward the corner where Erik Carstens was standing,
                    half hidden behind the broad figures of Lieutenant Thicker. </p>
                <p>"Did I hear a hundred?" repeated the auctioneer, wonderingly. "May I ask who was
                    the gentleman who said a hundred?" </p>
                <p>An embarrassing silence followed. Erik knew that if he acknowledged the bid he
                    would suffer the shame of having it refused. But his excitement and his
                    solicitude for the fair fame of his native city had carried him away so
                    completely that the words had escaped from his lips before he was fully aware of
                    their import. </p>
                <p>"May I ask," repeated the wielder of the hammer, slowly and emphatically, "may I
                    ask the gentleman who offered one hundred dollars for Lady Clare to come forward
                    and give his name?" </p>
                <p>He now looked straight at Erik, who blushed to the edge of his hair, but did not
                    stir from the spot. From sheer embarrassment he clutched the lieutenant's arm,
                    and almost pinched it. </p>
                <p>"Oh, I beg your pardon," the officer exclaimed, <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0188" n="151"/> addressing the
                    auctioneer, as if he had suddenly been aroused from a fit of abstraction; "I
                    made the bid of one hundred dollars, or&mdash;or&mdash;at any rate, I
                    make it now." </p>
                <p>The same performance, intended to force up the price, was repeated once more, but
                    with no avail, and at the end of two minutes Lady Clare was knocked down to
                    Lieutenant Thicker. </p>
                <p>"Now I have gone and done it like the blooming idiot that I am," observed the
                    lieutenant, when Lady Clare was led into his stable by a liveried groom. "What
                    an overhauling the captain will give me when he gets home." </p>
                <p>"You need have no fear," Erik replied. "I'll sound father as soon as he gets
                    home; and if he makes any trouble I'll pay you that one hundred dollars, with
                    interest, the day I come of age." </p>
                <p>Well, the captain came home, and having long had the intention to present his son
                    with a saddle-horse, he allowed himself to be cajoled into approving of the
                    bargain. The mare was an exquisite creature, if ever there was one, and he could
                    well understand how Erik had been carried away; Lieutenant Thicker, instead of
                    being hauled over the coals, as he had expected, received thanks for his kind
                    and generous conduct toward the son of his superior officer. As for Erik
                    himself, he had never had any idea that a boy's life could be so glorious as his
                    was now. Mounted on that splendid, <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0189" n="152"/> coal-black mare, he rode
                    through the city and far out into the country at his father's side; and never
                    did it seem to him that he had loved his father so well as he did during these
                    afternoon rides. The captain was far from suspecting that in that episode of the
                    purchase of Lady Clare his own relation to his son had been at stake. Not that
                    Erik would not have obeyed his father, even if he had turned out his rough side
                    and taken the lieutenant to task for his kindness; but their relation would in
                    that case have lacked the warm intimacy (which in nowise excludes obedience and
                    respect) and that last touch of devoted admiration which now bound them
                    together. </p>
                <p>That fine touch of sympathy in the captain's disposition which had enabled him to
                    smile indulgently at his son's enthusiasm for the horse made the son doubly
                    anxious not to abuse such kindness, and to do everything in his power to deserve
                    the confidence which made his life so rich and happy. Though, as I have said,
                    Captain Carstens lacked the acuteness to discover how much he owed to Lady
                    Clare, he acknowledged himself in quite a different way her debtor. He had never
                    really been aware what a splendid specimen of a boy his son was until he saw him
                    on the back of that spirited mare, which cut up with him like the Old Harry, and
                    yet never succeeded in flurrying, far less in unseating him. The captain felt a
                    glow of <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0190" n="153"/> affection warming his breast at the sight of this, and his
                    pride in Erik's horsemanship proved a consolation to him when the boy's less
                    distinguished performances at school caused him fret and worry. </p>
                <p>"A boy so full of pluck must amount to something, even if he does not take kindly
                    to Latin," he reflected many a time. "I am afraid I have made a mistake in
                    having him prepared for college. In the army now, and particularly in the
                    cavalry, he would make a reputation in twenty minutes." </p>
                <p>And a cavalryman Erik might, perhaps, have become if his father had not been
                    transferred to another post, and compelled to take up his residence in the
                    country. It was nominally a promotion, but Captain Carstens was ill pleased with
                    it, and even had some thought of resigning rather than give up his delightful
                    city life, and move far northward into the region of cod and herring. However,
                    he was too young a man to retire on a pension, as yet, and so he gradually
                    reconciled himself to the thought, and sailed northward in the month of April
                    with his son and his entire household. It had long been a question whether Lady
                    Clare should make the journey with them; for Captain Carstens maintained that so
                    high-bred an animal would be very sensitive to climatic changes and might even
                    die on the way. Again, he argued that it was an absurdity to bring so fine a
                    horse into a rough country, where the roads are poor and where <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002438_0191" n="154"/>
                    nature, in mercy, provides all beasts with rough, shaggy coats to protect them
                    from the cold. How would Lady Clare, with her glossy satin coat, her slender
                    legs that pirouetted so daintily over the ground, and her exquisite head, which
                    she carried so proudly&mdash;how would she look and what kind of figure
                    would she cut among the shaggy, stunted, sedate-looking nags of the Sognefiord
                    district? But the captain, though what he said was irrefutable, had to suspend
                    all argument when he saw how utterly wretched Erik became at the mere thought of
                    losing Lady Clare. So he took his chances; and, after having ordered blankets of
                    three different thicknesses for three different kinds of weather, shipped the
                    mare with the rest of his family for his new northern home. </p>
                <p>As the weather proved unusually mild during the northward voyage Lady Clare
                    arrived in Sogn without accident or adventure. And never in all her life had she
                    looked more beautiful than she did when she came off the steamer, and half the
                    population of the valley turned out to see her. It is no use denying that she
                    was as vain as any other professional beauty, and the way she danced and
                    pirouetted on the gangplank, when Erik led her on to the pier, filled the
                    rustics with amazement. They had come to look at the new captain and his family;
                    but when Lady Clare appeared she eclipsed the rest of the company so completely
                    that no one <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0192" n="155"/> had eyes for anybody but her. As the sun was shining
                    and the wind was mild, Erik had taken off her striped overcoat (which covered
                    her from nose to tail), for he felt in every fibre of his body the sensation she
                    was making, and blushed with pleasure as if the admiring exclamations had been
                    intended for himself. </p>
                <p>"Look at that horse," cried young and old, with eyes as big as saucers, pointing
                    with their fingers at Lady Clare. </p>
                <p>"Handsome carcass that mare has," remarked a stoutish man, who knew what he was
                    talking about; "and head and legs to match." </p>
                <p>"She beats your Valders-Roan all hollow, John Garvestad," said a young tease who
                    stood next to him in the crowd. </p>
                <p>"My Valders-Roan has never seen his match yet, and never will, according to my
                    reckoning," answered John Garvestad. </p>
                <p>"Ho! ho!" shouted the young fellow, with a mocking laugh; "that black mare is a
                    hand taller at the very least, and I bet you she's a high-flyer. She has got the
                    prettiest legs I ever clapped eyes on." </p>
                <p>"They'd snap like clay pipes in the mountains," replied Garvestad,
                    contemptuously. </p>
                <p>Erik, as he blushingly ascended the slope to his new home, leading Lady Clare by
                    a halter, had no suspicion of the sentiments which she had aroused in John
                    Garvestad's breast. He was only blissfully <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0193" n="156"/> conscious of the
                    admiration she had excited; and he promised himself a good deal of fun in future
                    in showing off his horsemanship. He took Lady Clare to the stable, where a new
                    box-stall had been made for her, examined the premises carefully and nailed a
                    board over a crevice in the wall where he suspected a draught. He instructed
                    Anders, the groom, with emphatic and anxious repetitions regarding her care,
                    showed him how to make Lady Clare's bed, how to comb her mane, how to brush her
                    (for she refused to endure currying), how to blanket her, and how to read the
                    thermometer which he nailed to one of the posts of the stall. The latter proved
                    to be a more difficult task than he had anticipated; and the worst of it was
                    that he was not sure that Anders knew any more on the subject of his instruction
                    at the end of the lesson than he had at the beginning. To make sure that he had
                    understood him he asked him to enter the stall and begin the process of
                    grooming. But no sooner had the unhappy fellow put his nose inside the door than
                    Lady Clare laid back her ears in a very ugly fashion, and with a vicious whisk
                    of her tail waltzed around and planted two hoof-marks in the door, just where
                    the groom's nose had that very instant vanished. A second and a third trial had
                    similar results; and as the box-stall was new and of hard wood, Erik had no wish
                    to see it further damaged. <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0194" n="157"/>
                </p>
                <p>"I won't have nothin' to do with that hoss, that's as certain as my name is
                    Anders," the groom declared; and Erik, knowing that persuasion would be useless,
                    had henceforth to be his own groom. The fact was he could not help sympathizing
                    with that fastidiousness of Lady Clare which made her object to be handled by
                    coarse fingers and roughly curried, combed, and washed like a common plebeian
                    nag. One does not commence life associating with a princess for nothing. Lady
                    Clare, feeling in every nerve her high descent and breeding, had perhaps a sense
                    of having come down in the world, and, like many another irrational creature of
                    her sex, she kicked madly against fate and exhibited the unloveliest side of her
                    character. But with all her skittishness and caprice she was steadfast in one
                    thing, and that was her love for Erik. As the days went by in country monotony,
                    he began to feel it as a privilege rather than a burden to have the exclusive
                    care of her. The low, friendly neighing with which she always greeted him, as
                    soon as he opened the stable-door, was as intelligible and dear to him as the
                    warm welcome of a friend. And when with dainty alertness she lifted her small,
                    beautiful head, over which the fine net-work of veins meandered, above the top
                    of the stall, and rubbed her nose caressingly against his cheek, before
                    beginning to snuff at his various pockets for the accustomed lump of sugar, he
                    felt a glow of affection <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0195" n="158"/> spread from his heart and pervade his
                    whole being. Yes, he loved this beautiful animal with a devotion which, a year
                    ago, he would scarcely have thought it possible to bestow upon a horse. No one
                    could have persuaded him that Lady Clare had not a soul which (whether it was
                    immortal or not) was, at all events, as distinct and clearly defined as that of
                    any person with whom he was acquainted. She was to him a personality&mdash;a
                    dear, charming friend, with certain defects of character (as who has not?) which
                    were, however, more than compensated for by her devotion to him. She was
                    fastidious, quick-tempered, utterly unreasonable where her feelings were
                    involved; full of aristocratic prejudice, which only her sex could excuse; and
                    whimsical, proud, and capricious. It was absurd, of course, to contend that
                    these qualities were in themselves admirable; but, on the other hand, few of us
                    would not consent to overlook them in a friend who loved us as well as Lady
                    Clare loved Erik. </p>
                <p>The fame of Lady Clare spread through the parish like fire in withered grass.
                    People came from afar to look at her, and departed full of wonder at her beauty.
                    When the captain and his son rode together to church on Sunday morning, men,
                    women, and children stood in rows at the roadside staring at the wonderful mare
                    as if she had been a dromedary or a rhinoceros. And when she was tied in the
                    clergyman's stable a large number of the men <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0196" n="159"/> ignored the
                    admonition of the church bells and missed the sermon, being unable to tear
                    themselves away from Lady Clare's charms. But woe to him who attempted to take
                    liberties with her; there were two or three horsy young men who had narrow
                    escapes from bearing the imprint of her iron shoes for the rest of their days.
                    That taught the others a lesson, and now Lady Clare suffered from no annoying
                    familiarities, but was admired at a respectful distance, until the pastor, vexed
                    at her rivalry with his sermon, issued orders to have the stable-door locked
                    during service. </p>
                <p>There was one person besides the pastor who was ill pleased at the reputation
                    Lady Clare was making. That was John Garvestad, the owner of Valders-Roan. John
                    was the richest man in the parish, and always made a point of keeping fine
                    horses. Valders-Roan, a heavily built, powerful horse, with a tremendous neck
                    and chest and long tassels on his fetlocks, but rather squat in the legs, had
                    hitherto held undisputed rank as the finest horse in all Sogn. By the side of
                    Lady Clare he looked as a stout, good-looking peasant lad with coltish manners
                    might have looked by the side of the daughter of a hundred earls. </p>
                <p>But John Garvestad, who was naturally prejudiced in favor of his own horse, could
                    scarcely be blamed for failing to recognize her superiority. He knew that
                    formerly, on Sundays, the men were <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0197" n="160"/> wont to gather with admiring
                    comment about Valders-Roan; while now they stood craning their necks, peering
                    through the windows of the parson's stable, in order to catch a glimpse of Lady
                    Clare, and all the time Valders-Roan was standing tied to the fence, in full
                    view of all, utterly neglected. This spectacle filled him with such ire that he
                    hardly could control himself. His first impulse was to pick a quarrel with Erik;
                    but a second and far brighter idea presently struck him. He would buy Lady
                    Clare. Accordingly, when the captain and his son had mounted their horses and
                    were about to start on their homeward way, Garvestad, putting Valders-Roan to
                    his trumps, dug his heels into his sides and rode up with a great flourish in
                    front of the churchyard gate. </p>
                <p>"How much will you take for that mare of yours, captain?" he asked, as he checked
                    his charger with unnecessary vigor close to Lady Clare. </p>
                <p>"She is not mine to sell," the captain replied. "Lady Clare belongs to my son." </p>
                <p>"Well, what will you take for her, then?" Garvestad repeated, swaggeringly,
                    turning to Erik. </p>
                <p>"Not all the gold in the world could buy her," retorted Erik, warmly. </p>
                <p>Valders-Roan, unable to resist the charms of Lady Clare, had in the meanwhile
                    been making some cautious overtures toward an acquaintance. He arched his mighty
                    neck, rose on his hind legs, while <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0198" n="161"/> his tremendous forehoofs were
                    beating the air, and cut up generally&mdash;all for Lady Clare's benefit. </p>
                <p>She, however, having regarded his performances for awhile with a mild and
                    somewhat condescending interest, grew a little tired of them and looked out over
                    the fiord, as a belle might do, with a suppressed yawn, when her cavalier fails
                    to entertain her. Valders-Roan, perceiving the slight, now concluded to make
                    more decided advances. So he put forward his nose until it nearly touched Lady
                    Clare's, as if he meant to kiss her. But that was more than her ladyship was
                    prepared to put up with. Quick as a flash she flung herself back on her
                    haunches, down went her ears, and hers was the angriest horse's head that ever
                    had been seen in that parish. With an indignant snort she wheeled around,
                    kicking up a cloud of dust by the suddenness of the man&oelig;uvre. A less
                    skilled rider than Erik would inevitably have been thrown by two such unforeseen
                    jerks; and the fact was he had all he could do to keep his seat. </p>
                <p>"Oho!" shouted Garvestad, "your mare shies; she'll break your neck some day, as
                    likely as not. You had better sell her before she gets you into trouble." </p>
                <p>"But I shouldn't like to have your broken neck on my conscience," Erik replied;
                    "if necks are to be broken by Lady Clare I should prefer to have it be my own."
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0199" n="162"/>
                </p>
                <p>The peasant was not clever enough to make out whether this was jest or earnest.
                    With a puzzled frown he stared at the youth and finally broke out: </p>
                <p>"Then you won't sell her at no price? Any way, the day you change your mind don't
                    forget to notify John Garvestad. If it's spondulix you are after, then here's
                    where there's plenty of 'em." </p>
                <p>He slapped his left breast-pocket with a great swagger, looking around to observe
                    the impression he was making on his audience; then, jerking the bridle
                    violently, so as to make his horse rear, he rode off like Alexander on
                    Bucephalus, and swung down upon the highway. </p>
                <p>It was but a few weeks after this occurrence that Captain Carstens and his son
                    were invited to honor John Garvestad by their presence at his wedding. They were
                    in doubt, at first, as to whether they ought to accept the invitation; for some
                    unpleasant rumors had reached them, showing that Garvestad entertained
                    unfriendly feelings toward them. He was an intensely vain man; and the thought
                    that Erik Carstens had a finer horse than Valders-Roan left him no peace. He had
                    been heard to say repeatedly that, if that high-nosed youth persisted in his
                    refusal to sell the mare, he would discover his mistake when, perhaps, it would
                    be too late to have it remedied. Whatever that meant, it sufficed to make both
                    Erik and his father uneasy. But, on the other hand, it would be the worst policy
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0200" n="163"/> possible, under such circumstances, to refuse the invitation.
                    For that would be interpreted either as fear or as aristocratic exclusiveness;
                    and the captain, while he was new in the district, was as anxious to avoid the
                    appearance of the one as of the other. Accordingly he accepted the invitation
                    and on the appointed day rode with his son into the wide yard of John
                    Garvestad's farm, stopping at the pump, where they watered their horses. It was
                    early in the afternoon, and both the house and the barn were thronged with
                    wedding-guests. From the sitting-room the strains of two fiddles were heard,
                    mingled with the scraping and stamping of heavy feet. Another musical
                    performance was in progress in the barn; and all over the yard elderly men and
                    youths were standing in smaller and larger groups, smoking their pipes and
                    tasting the beer-jugs, which were passed from hand to hand. But the moment Lady
                    Clare was seen all interest in minor concerns ceased, and with one accord the
                    crowd moved toward her, completely encircling her, and viewing her with admiring
                    glances that appreciated all her perfections. </p>
                <p>"Did you ever see cleaner-shaped legs on a horse?" someone was heard to say, and
                    instantly his neighbor in the crowd joined the chorus of praise, and added:
                    "What a snap and spring there is in every bend of her knee and turn of her neck
                    and flash of her eye!" <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0201" n="164"/>
                </p>
                <p>It was while this chorus of admiration was being sung in all keys and tones of
                    the whole gamut, that the bridegroom came out of the house, a little bit tipsy,
                    perhaps, from the many toasts he had been obliged to drink, and bristling with
                    pugnacity to the ends of his fingers and the tips of his hair. Every word of
                    praise that he heard sounded in his ears like a jeer and an insult to himself.
                    With ruthless thrusts he elbowed his way through the throng of guests and soon
                    stood in front of the two horses, from which the captain and Erik had not yet
                    had a chance to dismount. He returned their greeting with scant courtesy and
                    plunged instantly into the matter which he had on his mind. </p>
                <p>"I reckon you have thought better of my offer by this time," he said, with a
                    surly swagger, to Erik. "What do you hold your mare at to-day?" </p>
                <p>"I thought we had settled that matter once for all," the boy replied, quietly. "I
                    have no more intention of selling Lady Clare now than I ever had." </p>
                <p>"Then will ye trade her off for Valders-Roan?" ejaculated Garvestad, eagerly. </p>
                <p>"No, I won't trade her for Valders-Roan or any other horse in creation." </p>
                <p>"Don't be cantankerous, now, young fellow, or you might repent of it." </p>
                <p>"I am not cantankerous. But I beg of you kindly to drop this matter. I came here,
                    at your <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0202" n="165"/> invitation, as a guest at your wedding, not for the
                    purpose of trading horses." </p>
                <p>It was an incautious speech, and was interpreted by everyone present as a rebuke
                    to the bridegroom for his violation of the rules of hospitality. The captain,
                    anxious to avoid a row, therefore broke in, in a voice of friendly remonstrance:
                    "My dear Mr. Garvestad, do let us drop this matter. If you will permit us, we
                    should like to dismount and drink a toast to your health, wishing you a long
                    life and much happiness." </p>
                <p>"Ah, yes, I understand your smooth palaver," the bridegroom growled between his
                    teeth. "I have stood your insolence long enough, and, by jingo, I won't stand it
                    much longer. What will ye take for your mare, I say, or how much do you want to
                    boot, if you trade her for Valders-Roan?" </p>
                <p>He shouted the last words with furious emphasis, holding his clinched fist up
                    toward Erik, and glaring at him savagely. </p>
                <p>But now Lady Clare, who became frightened perhaps by the loud talk and violent
                    gestures, began to rear and plunge, and by an unforeseen motion knocked against
                    the bridegroom, so that he fell backward into the horse-trough under the pump,
                    which was full of water. The wedding-guests had hardly time to realize what was
                    happening when a great splash sent the water flying into their faces, and the
                    burly form of John Garvestad <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0203" n="166"/> was seen sprawling helplessly in the
                    horse-trough. But then&mdash;then they realized it with a vengeance. And a
                    laugh went up&mdash;a veritable storm of laughter &mdash;which swept
                    through the entire crowd and re-echoed with a ghostly hilarity from the
                    mountains. John Garvestad in the meanwhile had managed to pick himself out of
                    the horse-trough, and while he stood snorting, spitting, and dripping, Captain
                    Carstens and his son politely lifted their hats to him and rode away. But as
                    they trotted out of the gate they saw their host stretch a big clinched fist
                    toward them, and heard him scream with hoarse fury: "I'll make ye smart for that
                    some day, so help me God!" </p>
                <p>Lady Clare was not sent to the mountains in the summer, as are nearly all horses
                    in the Norwegian country districts. She was left untethered in an enclosed home
                    pasture about half a mile from the mansion. Here she grazed, rolled, kicked up
                    her heels, and gambolled to her heart's content. During the long, bright summer
                    nights, when the sun scarcely dips beneath the horizon and reappears in an hour,
                    clothed in the breezy garments of morning, she was permitted to frolic, race,
                    and play all sorts of improvised games with a shaggy, little, plebeian
                    three-year-old colt whom she had condescended to honor with her acquaintance.
                    This colt must have had some fine feeling under his rough coat, for he never
                    presumed in the least upon <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0204" n="167"/> the acquaintance, being perhaps aware
                    of the honor it conferred upon him. He allowed himself to be abused, ignored, or
                    petted, as it might suit the pleasure of her royal highness, with a patient,
                    even-tempered good-nature which was admirable. When Lady Clare (perhaps for fear
                    of making him conceited) took no notice of him, he showed neither resentment nor
                    surprise, but walked off with a sheepish shake of his head. Thus he slowly
                    learned the lesson to make no exhibition of feeling at the sight of his
                    superior; not to run up and greet her with a disrespectfully joyous whinny; but
                    calmly wait for her to recognize him before appearing to be aware of her
                    presence. It took Lady Clare several months to accustom Shag (for that was the
                    colt's name) to her ways. She taught him unconsciously the rudiments of good
                    manners; but he proved himself docile, and when he once had been reduced to his
                    proper place he proved a fairly acceptable companion. </p>
                <p>During the first and second week after John Garvestad's wedding Erik had kept
                    Lady Clare stabled, having a vague fear that the angry peasant might intend to
                    do her harm. But she whinnied so pitifully through the long light nights that
                    finally he allowed his compassion to get the better of his anxiety, and once
                    more she was seen racing madly about the field with Shag, whom she always beat
                    so ignominiously that she felt half sorry for <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0205" n="168"/> him, and as a
                    consolation allowed him gently to claw her mane with his teeth. This was a
                    privilege which Shag could not fail to appreciate, though she never offered to
                    return the favor by clawing him. At any rate, as soon as Lady Clare reappeared
                    in the meadow Shag's cup of bliss seemed to be full. </p>
                <p>A week passed in this way, nothing happened, and Erik's vigilance was relaxed. He
                    went to bed on the evening of July 10th with an easy mind, without the remotest
                    apprehension of danger. The sun set about ten o'clock, and Lady Clare and Shag
                    greeted its last departing rays with a whinny, accompanied by a wanton kickup
                    from the rear&mdash;for whatever Lady Clare did Shag felt in honor bound to
                    do, and was conscious of no disgrace in his abject and ape-like imitation. They
                    had spent an hour, perhaps, in such delightful performances, when all of a
                    sudden they were startled by a deep bass whinny, which rumbled and shook like
                    distant thunder. Then came the tramp, tramp, tramp of heavy hoof-beats, which
                    made the ground tremble. Lady Clare lifted her beautiful head and looked with
                    fearless curiosity in the direction whence the sound came. Shag, of course, did
                    as nearly as he could exactly the same. What they saw was a big roan horse with
                    an enormous arched neck, squat feet, and long-tasselled fetlocks. </p>
                <p>Lady Clare had no difficulty in recognizing Valders-Roan. <pb
                    entity="DSSR_000002438_0206" n="169"/> But how
                    big and heavy and ominous he looked in the blood-red after-glow of the blood-red
                    sunset. For the first time in her life Lady Clare felt a cold shiver of fear run
                    through her. There was, happily, a fence between them, and she devoutly hoped
                    that Valders-Roan was not a jumper. At that moment, however, two men appeared
                    next to the huge horse, and Lady Clare heard the sound of breaking fence-rails.
                    The deep hoarse whinny once more made the air shake, and it made poor Lady Clare
                    shake too, for now she saw Valders-Roan come like a whirlwind over the field,
                    and so powerful were his hoof-beats that a clod of earth which had stuck to one
                    of his shoes shot like a bullet through the air. He looked so gigantic, so
                    brimming with restrained strength, and somehow Lady Clare, as she stood quaking
                    at the sight of him, had never seemed to herself so dainty, frail, and delicate
                    as she seemed in this moment. She felt herself so entirely at his mercy; she was
                    no match for him surely. Shag, anxious as ever to take his cue from her, had
                    stationed himself at her side, and shook his head and whisked his tail in a
                    non-committal manner. Now Valders-Roan had cleared the fence where the men had
                    broken it down; then on he came again, tramp, tramp, tramp, until he was within
                    half a dozen paces from Lady Clare. There he stopped, for back went Lady Clare's
                    pretty ears, while she <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0207" n="170"/> threw herself upon her haunches in an
                    attitude of defence. She was dimly aware that this was a foolish thing to do,
                    but her inbred disdain and horror of everything rough made her act on instinct
                    instead of reason. Valders-Roan, irritated by this uncalled-for action, now
                    threw ceremony to the winds, and without further ado trotted up and rubbed his
                    nose against hers. That was more than Lady Clare could stand. With an hysterical
                    snort she flung herself about, and up flew her heels straight into the offending
                    nose, inflicting considerable damage. Shag, being now quite clear that the
                    programme was fight, whisked about in exactly the same manner, with as close an
                    imitation of Lady Clare's snort as he could produce, and a second pair of
                    steel-shod heels came within a hair of reducing the enemy's left nostril to the
                    same condition as the right. But alas for the generous folly of youth! Shag had
                    to pay dearly for that exhibition of devotion. Valders-Roan, enraged by this
                    wanton insult, made a dash at Shag, and by the mere impetus of his huge bulk
                    nearly knocked him senseless. The colt rolled over, flung all his four legs into
                    the air, and as soon as he could recover his footing reeled sideways like a
                    drunken man and made haste to retire to a safe distance. </p>
                <p>Valders-Roan had now a clear field and could turn his undivided attention to Lady
                    Clare. I am <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0208" n="171"/> not sure that he had not made an example of Shag
                    merely to frighten her. Bounding forward with his mighty chest expanded and the
                    blood dripping from his nostrils, he struck out with a tremendous hind leg and
                    would have returned Lady Clare's blow with interest if she had not leaped high
                    into the air. She had just managed by her superior alertness to dodge that
                    deadly hoof, and was perhaps not prepared for an instant renewal of the attack.
                    But she had barely gotten her four feet in contact with the sod when two rows of
                    terrific teeth plunged into her withers. The pain was frightful, and with a
                    long, pitiful scream Lady Clare sank down upon the ground, and, writhing with
                    agony, beat the air with her hoofs. Shag, who had by this time recovered his
                    senses, heard the noise of the battle, and, plucking up his courage, trotted
                    bravely forward against the victorious Valders-Roan. He was so frightened that
                    his heart shot up into his throat. But there lay Lady Clare mangled and
                    bleeding. He could not leave her in the lurch, so forward he came, trembling,
                    just as Lady Clare was trying to scramble to her feet. Led away by his sympathy
                    Shag bent his head down toward her and thereby prevented her from rising. And in
                    the same instant a stunning blow hit him straight in the forehead, a shower of
                    sparks danced before his eyes, and then Shag saw and heard no more. A convulsive
                    quiver ran through <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0209" n="172"/> his body, then he stretched out his neck on the
                    bloody grass, heaved a sigh, and died. </p>
                <p>Lady Clare, seeing Shag killed by the blow which had been intended for herself,
                    felt her blood run cold. She was strongly inclined to run, for she could easily
                    beat the heavy Valders-Roan at a race, and her fleet legs might yet save her. I
                    cannot say whether it was a generous wrath at the killing of her humble champion
                    or a mere blind fury which overcame this inclination. But she knew now neither
                    pain nor fear. With a shrill scream she rushed at Valders-Roan, and for five
                    minutes a whirling cloud of earth and grass and lumps of sod moved irregularly
                    over the field, and tails, heads, and legs were seen flung and tossed madly
                    about, while an occasional shriek of rage or of pain startled the night, and
                    re-echoed with a weird resonance between the mountains. </p>
                <p>It was about five o'clock in the morning of July 11th, that Erik awoke, with a
                    vague sense that something terrible had happened. His groom was standing at his
                    bedside with a terrified face, doubtful whether to arouse his young master or
                    allow him to sleep. </p>
                <p>"What has happened, Anders?" cried Erik, tumbling out of bed. </p>
                <p>"Lady Clare, sir&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Lady Clare!" shouted the boy. "What about her? Has she been stolen?" <pb
                    entity="DSSR_000002438_0210" n="173"
                    />
                </p>
                <p>"No, I reckon not," drawled Anders. </p>
                <p>"Then she's dead! Quick, tell me what you know or I shall go crazy!" </p>
                <p>"No; I can't say for sure she's dead either," the groom stammered, helplessly. </p>
                <p>Erik, being too stunned with grief and pain, tumbled in a dazed fashion about the
                    room, and scarcely knew how he managed to dress. He felt cold, shivery, and
                    benumbed; and the daylight had a cruel glare in it which hurt his eyes.
                    Accompanied by his groom, he hastened to the home pasture, and saw there the
                    evidence of the fierce battle which had raged during the night. A long, black,
                    serpentine track, where the sod had been torn up by furious hoof-beats, started
                    from the dead carcass of the faithful Shag and moved with irregular breaks and
                    curves up toward the gate that connected the pasture with the underbrush of
                    birch and alder. Here the fence had been broken down, and the track of the fight
                    suddenly ceased. A pool of blood had soaked into the ground, showing that one of
                    the horses, and probably the victor, must have stood still for a while, allowing
                    the vanquished to escape. </p>
                <p>Erik had no need of being told that the horse which had attacked Lady Clare was
                    Valders-Roan; and though he would scarcely have been able to prove it, he felt
                    positive that John Garvestad had arranged and probably watched the fight. Having
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0211" n="174"/> a wholesome dread of jail, he had not dared to steal Lady
                    Clare; but he had chosen this contemptible method to satisfy his senseless
                    jealousy. It was all so cunningly devised as to baffle legal inquiry.
                    Valders-Roan had gotten astray, and being a heavy beast, had broken into a
                    neighbor's field and fought with his filly, chasing her away into the mountains.
                    That was the story he would tell, of course, and as there had been no witnesses
                    present, there was no way of disproving it. </p>
                <p>Abandoning, however, for the time being all thought of revenge, Erik determined
                    to bend all his energies to the recovery of Lady Clare. He felt confident that
                    she had run away from her assailant, and was now roaming about in the mountains.
                    He therefore organized a search party of all the male servants on the estate,
                    besides a couple of volunteers, making in all nine. On the evening of the first
                    day's search they put up at a saeter or mountain chalet. Here they met a young
                    man named Tollef Morud, who had once been a groom at John Garvestad's. This man
                    had a bad reputation; and as the idea occurred to some of them that he might
                    know something about Lady Clare's disappearance, they questioned him at great
                    length, without, however, eliciting a single crumb of information. </p>
                <p>For a week the search was continued, but had finally to be given up. Weary,
                    footsore, and heavy <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0212" n="175"/> hearted, Erik returned home. His grief at the
                    loss of Lady Clare began to tell on his health; and his perpetual plans for
                    getting even with John Garvestad amounted almost to a mania, and caused his
                    father both trouble and anxiety. It was therefore determined to send him to the
                    military academy in the capital. </p>
                <p>Four or five years passed and Erik became a lieutenant. It was during the first
                    year after his graduation from the military academy that he was invited to spend
                    the Christmas holidays with a friend, whose parents lived on a fine estate about
                    twenty miles from the city. Seated in their narrow sleighs, which were drawn by
                    brisk horses, they drove merrily along, shouting to each other to make their
                    voices heard above the jingling of the bells. About eight o'clock in the
                    evening, when the moon was shining brightly and the snow sparkling, they turned
                    in at a wayside tavern to order their supper. Here a great crowd of lumbermen
                    had congregated, and all along the fences their overworked, half-broken-down
                    horses stood, shaking their nose-bags. The air in the public room was so filled
                    with the fumes of damp clothes and bad tobacco that Erik and his friend, while
                    waiting for their meal, preferred to spend the time under the radiant sky. They
                    were sauntering about, talking in a desultory fashion, when all of a sudden a
                    wild, joyous whinny rang out upon the startled air. It came from a <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002438_0213" n="176"/>
                    rusty, black, decrepit-looking mare hitched to a lumber sleigh which they had
                    just passed. Erik, growing very serious, paused abruptly. </p>
                <p>A second whinny, lower than the first, but almost alluring and cajoling, was so
                    directly addressed to Erik that he could not help stepping up to the mare and
                    patting her on the nose. </p>
                <p>"You once had a horse you cared a great deal for, didn't you?" his friend
                    remarked, casually. </p>
                <p>"Oh, don't speak about it," answered Erik, in a voice that shook with emotion; "I
                    loved Lady Clare as I never loved any creature in this world&mdash;except my
                    father, of course," he added, reflectively. </p>
                <p>But what was the matter with the old lumber nag? At the sound of the name Lady
                    Clare she pricked up her ears, and lifted her head with a pathetic attempt at
                    alertness. With a low, insinuating neighing she rubbed her nose against the
                    lieutenant's cheek. He had let his hand glide over her long, thin neck, when
                    quite suddenly his fingers slid into a deep scar in the withers. </p>
                <p>"My God!" he cried, while the tears started to his eyes, "am I awake, or am I
                    dreaming?" </p>
                <p>"What in the world is the matter?" inquired his comrade, anxiously. </p>
                <p>"It is Lady Clare! By the heavens, it is Lady Clare!" </p>
                <p>"That old ramshackle of a lumber nag whose every rib you can count through her
                    skin is your <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0214" n="177"/> beautiful thoroughbred?" ejaculated his friend,
                    incredulously. "Come now, don't be a goose." </p>
                <p>"I'll tell you of it some other time," said Erik, quietly; "but there's not a
                    shadow of a doubt that this is Lady Clare." </p>
                <p>Yes, strange as it may seem, it was indeed Lady Clare. But oh, who would have
                    recognized in this skeleton, covered with a rusty-black skin and tousled mane
                    and forelock in which chaff and dirt were entangled&mdash;who would have
                    recognized in this drooping and rickety creature the proud, the dainty, the
                    exquisite Lady Clare? Her beautiful tail, which had once been her pride, was now
                    a mere scanty wisp; and a sharp, gnarled ridge running along the entire length
                    of her back showed every vertebra of her spine through the notched and scarred
                    skin. Poor Lady Clare, she had seen hard usage. But now the days of her
                    tribulations are at an end. It did not take Erik long to find the half-tipsy
                    lumberman who was Lady Clare's owner; nor to agree with him on the price for
                    which he was willing to part with her. </p>
                <p>There is but little more to relate. By interviews and correspondence with the
                    different parties through whose hands the mare had passed, Erik succeeded in
                    tracing her to Tollef Morud, the ex-groom of John Garvestad. On being promised
                    immunity from prosecution, he was induced to confess that he had been hired by
                    his former master to <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0215" n="178"/> arrange the nocturnal fight between Lady
                    Clare and Valders-Roan, and had been paid ten dollars for stealing the mare when
                    she had been sufficiently damaged. John Garvestad had himself watched the fight
                    from behind the fence, and had laughed fit to split his sides, until
                    Valders-Roan seemed on the point of being worsted. Then he had interfered to
                    separate them, and Tollef had led Lady Clare away, bleeding from a dozen wounds,
                    and had hidden her in a deserted lumberman's shed near the saeter where the
                    searchers had overtaken him. </p>
                <p>Having obtained these facts, Erik took pains to let John Garvestad know that the
                    chain of evidence against him was complete, and if he had had his own way he
                    would not have rested until his enemy had suffered the full penalty of the law.
                    But John Garvestad, suspecting what was in the young man's mind, suddenly
                    divested himself of his pride, and cringing dike a whipped dog, came and asked
                    Erik's pardon, entreating him not to prosecute. </p>
                <p>As for Lady Clare, she never recovered her lost beauty. A pretty fair-looking
                    mare she became, to be sure, when good feeding and careful grooming had made her
                    fat and glossy once more. A long and contented old age is, no doubt, in store
                    for her. Having known evil days, she appreciates the blessings which the change
                    in, her fate has brought her. The captain declares she is the best-tempered and
                    steadiest horse in his stable.</p>

                    <p>"OH, YOU never will amount to anything, Bonnyboy!" said Bonnyboy's father,
                        when he had vainly tried to show him how to use a gouge; for Bonnyboy had
                        just succeeded in gouging a piece out of his hand, and was standing
                        helplessly, letting his blood drop on an engraving of Napoleon at
                        Austerlitz, which had been sent to his father for framing. The trouble with
                        Bonnyboy was that he was not only awkward&mdash;left-handed in
                        everything he undertook, as his father put it&mdash;but he was so very
                        good-natured that it was impossible to get angry with him. His large blue
                        innocent eyes had a childlike wonder in them, when he had done anything
                        particularly stupid, and he was so willing and anxious to learn, that his
                        ill-success seemed a reason for pity rather than for wrath. Grim Norvold,
                        Bonnyboy's father, was by trade a carpenter, and handy as he was at all
                        kinds of tinkering, he found it particularly exasperating to have a son who
                        was so left-handed. There was scarcely anything Grim could not do. He could
                        take a watch apart and <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0217" n="180"/> put it together again; he could mend a
                        harness if necessary; he could make a wagon; nay, he could even doctor a
                        horse when it got spavin or glanders. He was a sort of jack-of-all-trades,
                        and a very useful man in a valley where mechanics were few and
                        transportation difficult. He loved work for its own sake, and was ill at
                        ease when he had not a tool in his hand. The exercise of his skill gave him
                        a pleasure akin to that which the fish feels in swimming, the eagle in
                        soaring, and the lark in singing. A finless fish, a wingless eagle, or a
                        dumb lark could not have been more miserable than Grim was when a succession
                        of holidays, like Easter or Christmas, compelled him to be idle. </p>
                    <p>When his son was born his chief delight was to think of the time when he
                        should be old enough to handle a tool, and learn the secrets of his father's
                        trade. Therefore, from the time the boy was old enough to sit or to crawl in
                        the shavings without getting his mouth and eyes full of sawdust, he gave him
                        a place under the turning bench, and talked or sang to him while he worked.
                        And Bonnyboy, in the meanwhile amused himself by getting into all sorts of
                        mischief. If it had not been for the belief that a good workman must grow up
                        in the atmosphere of the shop, Grim would have lost patience with his son
                        and sent him back to his mother, who had better facilities for taking care
                        of him. But the fact was he was too fond of the boy to be able to <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0218" n="181"/> dispense with him, and he would rather bear the loss resulting
                        from his mischief than miss his prattle and his pretty dimpled face. </p>
                    <p>It was when the child was eighteen or nineteen months old that he acquired
                        the name Bonnyboy. A woman of the neighborhood, who had called at the shop
                        with some article of furniture which she wanted to have mended, discovered
                        the infant in the act of investigating a pot of blue paint, with a part of
                        which he had accidentally decorated his face. </p>
                    <p>"Good gracious! what is that ugly thing you have got under your turning
                        bench?" she cried, staring at the child in amazement. </p>
                    <p>"No, he is not an ugly thing," replied the father, with resentment; "he is a
                        bonny boy, that's what he is." </p>
                    <p>The woman, in order to mollify Grim, turned to the boy, and asked, with her
                        sweetest manner, "What is your name, child?" </p>
                    <p>"Bonny boy," murmured the child, with a vaguely offended air&mdash;"bonny
                        boy." </p>
                    <p>And from that day the name Bonnyboy clung to him.</p>

                    <head> II. </head>

                    <p>TO teach Bonnyboy the trade of a carpenter was a task which would have
                        exhausted the patience of all the saints in the calendar. If there was any
                        possible <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0219" n="182"/> way of doing a thing wrong, Bonnyboy would be sure to
                        hit upon that way. When he was eleven years old he chopped off the third
                        joint of the ring-finger on his right hand with a cutting tool while working
                        the turning-lathe; and by the time he was fourteen it seemed a marvel to his
                        father that he had any fingers left at all. But Bonnyboy persevered in spite
                        of all difficulties, was always cheerful and of good courage, and when his
                        father, in despair, exclaimed: "Well, you will never amount to anything,
                        Bonnyboy," he would look up with his slow, winning smile and say: </p>
                    <p>"Don't worry, father. Better luck next time." </p>
                    <p>"But, my dear boy, how can I help worrying, when you don't learn anything by
                        which you can make your living?" </p>
                    <p>"Oh, well, father," said Bonnyboy, soothingly (for he was beginning to feel
                        sorry on his father's account rather than on his own), "I wouldn't bother
                        about that if I were you. I don't worry a bit. Something will turn up for me
                        to do, sooner or later." </p>
                    <p>"But you'll do it badly, Bonnyboy, and then you won't get a second chance.
                        And then, who knows but you may starve to death. You'll chop off the fingers
                        you have left; and when I am dead and can no longer look after you, I am
                        very much afraid you'll manage to chop off your head too." </p>
                    <p>"Well," observed Bonnyboy, cheerfully, "in that case I shall not starve to
                        death." <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0220" n="183"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>Grim had to laugh in spite of himself at the paternal way in which his son
                        comforted him, as if he were the party to be pitied. Bonnyboy's unfailing
                        cheerfulness, which had its great charm, began to cause him uneasiness,
                        because he feared it was but another form of stupidity. A cleverer boy would
                        have been sorry for his mistakes and anxious about his own future. But
                        Bonnyboy looked into the future with the serene confidence of a child, and
                        nothing under the sun ever troubled him, except his father's tendency to
                        worry. For he was very fond of his father, and praised him as a paragon of
                        skill and excellence. He lavished an abject admiration on everything he did
                        and said. His dexterity in the use of tools, and his varied accomplishments
                        as a watch-maker and a horse-doctor, filled Bonnyboy with ungrudging
                        amazement. He knew it was a hopeless thing for him to aspire to rival such
                        genius, and he took the thing philosophically, and did not aspire. </p>
                    <p>It occurred to Grim one day, when Bonnyboy had made a most discouraging
                        exhibition of his awkwardness, that it might be a good thing to ask the
                        pastor's advice in regard to him. The pastor had had a long experience in
                        educating children, and his own, though they were not all clever, promised
                        to turn out well. Accordingly Grim called at the parsonage, was well
                        received, and returned home charged to the muzzle with good advice. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0221" n="184"/> The pastor lent him a book full of stories, and recommended
                        him to read them to his son, and afterward question him about every single
                        fact which each story contained. This the pastor had found to be a good way
                        to develop the intellect of a backward boy.</p>

                <div2 id="d33" n="3" type="section">
                    <head> III. </head>

                    <p>WHEN Bonnyboy had been confirmed, the question again rose what was to become
                        of him. He was now a tall young fellow, red-checked, broad-shouldered, and
                        strong, and rather nice-looking. A slow, good-natured smile spread over his
                        face when anyone spoke to him, and he had a way of flinging his head back,
                        when the tuft of yellow hair which usually hung down over his forehead
                        obscured his sight. Most people liked him, even though they laughed at him
                        behind his back; but to his face nobody laughed, because his strength
                        inspired respect. Nor did he know what fear was when he was roused; but that
                        was probably, as people thought, because he did not know much of anything.
                        At any rate, on a certain occasion he showed that there was a limit to his
                        good-nature, and when that limit was reached, he was not as harmless a
                        fellow as he looked. </p>
                    <p>On the neighboring farm of Gimlehaug there was a wedding to which Grim and
                        his son were <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0222" n="185"/> invited. On the afternoon of the second wedding
                        day&mdash;for peasant weddings in Norway are often celebrated for three
                        days&mdash;a notorious bully named Ola Klemmerud took it into his head
                        to have some sport with the big good-natured simpleton. So, by way of
                        pleasantry, he pulled the tuft of hair which hung down upon Bonnyboy's
                        forehead. </p>
                    <p>"Don't do that," said Bonnyboy. </p>
                    <p>Ola Klemmerud chuckled, and the next time he passed Bonnyboy, pinched his
                        ear. </p>
                    <p>"If you do that again I sha'n't like you," cried Bonnyboy. </p>
                    <p>The innocence of that remark made the people laugh, and the bully, seeing
                        that their sympathy was on his side, was encouraged to continue his teasing.
                        Taking a few dancing steps across the floor, he managed to touch Bonnyboy's
                        nose with the toe of his boot, which feat again was rewarded with a burst of
                        laughter. The poor lad quietly blew his nose, wiped the perspiration off his
                        brow with a red handkerchief, and said, "Don't make me mad, Ola, or I might
                        hurt you." </p>
                    <p>This speech struck the company as being immensely funny, and they laughed
                        till the tears ran down their cheeks. At this moment Grim entered, and
                        perceived at once that Ola Klemmerud was amusing the company at his son's
                        expense. He grew hot about his ears, clinched his teeth, and stared
                        challengingly at the bully. The latter began <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0223" n="186"/> to feel
                        uncomfortable, but he could not stop at this point without turning the laugh
                        against himself, and that he had not the courage to do. So in order to avoid
                        rousing the father's wrath, and yet preserving his own dignity, he went over
                        to Bonnyboy, rumpled his hair with both his hands, and tweaked his nose.
                        This appeared such innocent sport, according to his notion, that no rational
                        creature could take offence at it. But Grim, whose sense of humor was
                        probably defective, failed to see it in that light. </p>
                    <p>"Let the boy alone," he thundered. </p>
                    <p>"Well, don't bite my head off, old man," replied Ola. "I haven't hurt your
                        fool of a boy. I have only been joking with him." </p>
                    <p>"I don't think you are troubled with overmuch wit yourself, judging by the
                        style of your jokes," was Grim's cool retort. </p>
                    <p>The company, who plainly saw that Ola was trying to wriggle out of his
                        difficulty, but were anxious not to lose an exciting scene, screamed with
                        laughter again; but this time at the bully's expense. The blood mounted to
                        his head, and his anger got the better of his natural cowardice. Instead of
                        sneaking off, as he had intended, he wheeled about on his heel and stood for
                        a moment irresolute, clinching his fist in his pocket. </p>
                    <p>"Why don't you take your lunkhead of a son home to his mother, if he isn't
                        bright enough to understand fun!" he shouted. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0224" n="187"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Now let me see if you are bright enough to understand the same kind of fun,"
                        cried Grim. Whereupon he knocked off Ola's cap, rumpled his hair, and gave
                        his nose such a pull that it was a wonder it did not come off. </p>
                    <p>The bully, taken by surprise, tumbled a step backward, but recovering
                        himself, struck Grim in the face with his clinched fist. At this moment.
                        Bonnyboy, who had scarcely taken in the situation; jumped up and screamed,
                        "Sit down, Ola Klemmerud, sit down!" </p>
                    <p>The effect of this abrupt exclamation was so comical, that people nearly fell
                        from their benches as they writhed and roared with laughter. </p>
                    <p>Bonnyboy, who had risen to go to his father's assistance, paused in
                        astonishment in the middle of the floor. He could not comprehend, poor boy,
                        why everything he said provoked such uncontrollable mirth. He surely had no
                        intention of being funny. So, taken aback a little, he repeated to himself,
                        half wonderingly, with an abrupt pause after each word,
                        "Sit&mdash;down&mdash;Ola&mdash;Klemmerud&mdash;sit&mdash;down!" </p>
                    <p>But Ola Klemmerud, instead of sitting down, hit Grim repeatedly about the
                        face and head, and it was evident that the elder man, in spite of his
                        strength, was not a match for him in alertness. This dawned presently upon
                        Bonnyboy's slow comprehension, and his good-natured smile gave way to a <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0225" n="188"/> flush of excitement. He took two long strides across the
                        floor, pushed his father gently aside, and stood facing his antagonist. He
                        repeated once more his invitation to sit down; to which the latter responded
                        with a slap which made the sparks dance before Bonnyboy's eyes. Now Bonnyboy
                        became really angry. Instead of returning the slap, he seized his enemy with
                        a sudden and mighty grab by both his shoulders, lifted him up as if he were
                        a bag of hay, and put him down on a chair with such force that it broke into
                        splinters under him. </p>
                    <p>"Will you now sit down?" said Bonnyboy. </p>
                    <p>Nobody laughed this time, and the bully, not daring to rise, remained seated
                        on the floor among the ruins of the chair. Thereupon, with imperturbable
                        composure, Bonnyboy turned to his father, brushed off his coat with his
                        hands and smoothed his disordered hair. "Now let us go home, father," he
                        said, and taking the old man's arm he walked out of the room. But hardly had
                        he crossed the threshold before the astonished company broke into cheering. </p>
                    <p>"Good for you, Bonnyboy!" "Well done, Bonnyboy!" "You are a bully boy,
                        Bonnyboy!" they cried after him. </p>
                    <p>But Bonnyboy strode calmly along, quite unconscious of his triumph, and only
                        happy to have gotten his father out of the room safe and sound. For a good
                        while they walked on in silence. Then, 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0226"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0227"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0228" n="189"/> when the effect of the excitement had begun to wear away, Grim
                        stopped in the path, gazed admiringly at his son, and said, "Well, Bonnyboy,
                        you are a queer fellow." </p>
                    <p>"Oh, yes," answered Bonnyboy, blushing with embarrassment (for though he did
                        not comprehend the remark, he felt the approving gaze); "but then, you know,
                        I asked him to sit down, and he wouldn't." </p>
                    <p>"Bless your innocent heart!" murmured his father, as he gazed at Bonnyboy's
                        honest face with a mingling of affection and pity.</p>

                    <head> IV. </head>

                    <p>WHEN Bonnyboy was twenty years old his father gave up, once for all, his
                        attempt to make a carpenter of him. A number of saw-mills had been built
                        during the last years along the river down in the valley, and the old rapids
                        had been broken up into a succession of mill-dams, one above the other. At
                        one of these saw-mills Bonnyboy sought work, and was engaged with many
                        others as a mill hand. His business was to roll the logs on to the little
                        trucks that ran on rails, and to push them up to the saws, where they were
                        taken in charge by another set of men, who fastened and watched them while
                        they were cut up into planks. Very little <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0229" n="190"/> art was, indeed,
                        required for this simple task; but strength was required, and of this
                        Bonnyboy had enough and to spare. He worked with a will from early morn till
                        dewy eve, and was happy in the thought that he had at last found something
                        that he could do. It made the simple-hearted fellow proud to observe that he
                        was actually gaining his father's regard; or, at all events, softening the
                        disappointment which, in a vague way, he knew that his dulness must have
                        caused him. If, occasionally, he was hurt by a rolling log, he never let any
                        one know it; but even though his foot was a mass of agony every time he
                        stepped on it, he would march along as stiffly as a soldier. It was as if he
                        felt his father's eye upon him long before he saw him. </p>
                    <p>There was a curious kind of sympathy between them which expressed itself, on
                        the father's part, in a need to be near his son. But he feared to avow any
                        such weakness, knowing that Bonnyboy would interpret it as distrust of his
                        ability to take care of himself, and a desire to help him if he got into
                        trouble. Grim, therefore, invented all kinds of transparent pretexts for
                        paying visits to the saw-mills. And when he saw Bonnyboy, conscious that his
                        eye was resting upon him, swinging his axe so that the chips flew about his
                        ears, and the perspiration rained from his brow, a dim anxiety often took
                        possession of him, though he could give no reason for it. That big brawny
                        fellow, with the frame of a man <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0230" n="191"/> and the brain of a child, with
                        his guileless face and his guileless heart, strangely moved his compassion.
                        There was something almost beautiful about him, his father thought; but he
                        could not have told what it was; nor would he probably have found any one
                        else that shared his opinion. That frank and genial gaze of Bonnyboy's,
                        which expressed goodness of heart but nothing else, seemed to Grim an "open
                        sesame" to all hearts; and that unawakened something which goes so well with
                        childhood, but not with adult age, filled him with tenderness and a vague
                        anxiety. "My poor lad," he would murmur to himself, as he caught sight of
                        Bonnyboy's big perspiring face, with the yellow tuft of hair hanging down
                        over his forehead, "clever you are not; but you have that which the
                        cleverest of us often lack."</p>

                <div2 id="d35" n="5" type="section">
                    <head> V. </head>

                    <p>THERE were sixteen saw-mills in all, and the one at which Bonnyboy was
                        employed was the last of the series. They were built on little terraces on
                        both banks of the river, and every four of them were supplied with power
                        from an artificial dam, in which the water was stored in time of drought,
                        and from which it escaped in a mill-race when required for use. These four
                        dams were built of big stones, earthwork, and lumber, faced with smooth
                        planks, <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0231" n="192"/> over which a small quantity of water usually drizzled
                        into the shallow river-bed. Formerly, before the power was utilized, this
                        slope had been covered with seething and swirling rapids&mdash;a
                        favorite resort of the salmon, which leaped high in the spring, and were
                        caught in the box-traps that hung on long beams over the water. Now the
                        salmon had small chance of shedding their spawn in the cool, bright mountain
                        pools, for they could not leap the dams, and if by chance one got into the
                        mill-race, it had a hopeless struggle against a current that would have
                        carried an elephant off his feet. Bonnyboy, who more than once had seen the
                        beautiful silvery fish spring right on to the millwheel, and be flung upon
                        the rocks, had wished that he had understood the language of the fishes, so
                        that he might tell them how foolish such proceedings were. But merciful
                        though he was, he had been much discouraged when, after having put them back
                        into the river, they had promptly repeated the experiment. </p>
                    <p>There were about twenty-five or thirty men employed at the mill where
                        Bonnyboy earned his bread in the sweat of his brow, and he was, on the
                        whole, on good terms with all of them. They did, to be sure, make fun of him
                        occasionally; but sometimes he failed to understand it, and at other times
                        he made clumsy but good-humored attempts to repay their gibes in kind. They
                        took good care, however, not to rouse his wrath, for the reputation he <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0232" n="193"/> had acquired by his treatment of Ola Klemmerud made them
                        afraid to risk a collision. </p>
                    <p>This was the situation when the great floods of 188-came, and introduced a
                        spice of danger into Bonnyboy's monotonous life. The mill-races were now
                        kept open night and day, and yet the water burst like a roaring cascade over
                        the tops of dams, and the river-bed was filled to overflowing with a
                        swiftly-hurrying tawny torrent, which filled the air with its rush and
                        swash, and sent hissing showers of spray flying through the tree-tops.
                        Bonnyboy and a gang of twenty men were working as they had never worked
                        before in their lives, under the direction of an engineer, who had been
                        summoned by the mill-owner to strengthen the dams; for if but one of them
                        burst, the whole tremendous volume of water would be precipitated upon the
                        valley, and the village by the lower falls and every farm within half a mile
                        of the river-banks would be swept out of existence. Guards were stationed
                        all the way up the river to intercept any stray lumber that might be afloat.
                        For if a log jam were added to the terrific strain of the flood, there would
                        surely be no salvation possible. Yet in spite of all precautions, big logs
                        now and then came bumping against the dams, and shot with wild gyrations and
                        somersaults down into the brown eddies below. </p>
                    <p>The engineer, who was standing on the top of a log pile, had shouted until he
                        was hoarse, and gesticulated <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0233" n="194"/> with his cane until his arms were
                        lame, but yet there was a great deal to do before he could go to bed with an
                        easy conscience. Bonnyboy and his comrades, who had had by far the harder
                        part of the task, were ready to drop with fatigue. It was now eight o'clock
                        in the evening, and they had worked since six in the morning, and had
                        scarcely had time to swallow their scant rations. Some of them began to
                        grumble, and the engineer had to coax and threaten them to induce them to
                        persevere for another hour. The moon was just rising behind the mountain
                        ridges, and the beautiful valley lay, with its green fields, sprouting
                        forests, and red-painted farm-houses, at Bonnyboy's feet. It was terrible to
                        think that perhaps destruction was to overtake those happy and peaceful
                        homes, where men had lived and died for many hundred years. Bonnyboy could
                        scarcely keep back the tears when this fear suddenly came over him. Was it
                        not strange that, though they knew that danger was threatening, they made
                        not the slightest effort to save themselves? In the village below men were
                        still working in their forges, whose chimneys belched forth fiery smoke, and
                        the sound of their hammer-blows could be heard above the roar of the river.
                        Women were busy with their household tasks; some boys were playing in the
                        streets, damming up the gutters and shrieking with joy when their dams
                        broke. A few provident souls had driven their <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0234" n="195"/> cattle to the
                        neighboring hills; but neither themselves nor their children had they
                        thought it necessary to remove. The fact was, nobody believed that the dams
                        would break, as they had not imagination enough to foresee what would happen
                        if the dams did break. </p>
                    <p>Bonnyboy was wet to the skin, and his knees were a trifle shaky from
                        exhaustion. He had been cutting down an enormous mast-tree, which was needed
                        for a prop to the dam, and had hauled it down with two horses, one of which
                        was a half-broken gray colt, unused to pulling in a team. To restrain this
                        frisky animal had required all Bonnyboy's strength, and he stood wiping his
                        brow with the sleeve of his shirt. Just at that moment a terrified yell
                        sounded from above: "Run for your lives! The upper dam is breaking!" </p>
                    <p>The engineer from the top of the log-pile cast a swift glance up the valley,
                        and saw at once from the increasing volume of water that the report was
                        true. </p>
                    <p>"Save yourselves, lads!" he screamed. "Run to the woods!" </p>
                    <p>And suiting his action to his words, he tumbled down from the log pile, and
                        darted up the hill-side toward the forest. The other men, hearing the wild
                        rush and roar above them, lost no time in following his example. Only
                        Bonnyboy, slow of comprehension as always, did not obey. Suddenly there
                        flared up a wild resolution in his face. He <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0235" n="196"/> pulled out his
                        knife, cut the traces, and leaped upon the colt's back. Lashing the beast,
                        and shouting at the top of his voice, he dashed down the hill-side at a
                        break-neck pace. </p>
                    <p>"The dam is breaking!" he roared. "Run for the woods!" </p>
                    <p>He glanced anxiously behind him to see if the flood was overtaking him. A
                        great cloud of spray was rising against the sky, and he heard the yells of
                        men and the frenzied neighing of horses through the thunderous roar. But
                        happily there was time. The dam was giving way gradually, and had not yet
                        let loose the tremendous volume of death and desolation which it held
                        enclosed within its frail timbers. The colt, catching the spirit of
                        excitement in the air, flew like the wind, leaving farm after farm behind
                        it, until it reached the village. </p>
                    <p>"The dam is breaking! Run for your lives!" cried Bonnyboy, with a rousing
                        clarion yell which rose above all other poises; and up and down the valley
                        the dread tidings spread like wildfire. In an instant all was in wildest
                        commotion. Terrified mothers, with babes in their arms, came bursting out of
                        the houses, and little girls, hugging kittens or cages with canary-birds,
                        clung weeping to their skirts; shouting men, shrieking women, crying
                        children, barking dogs, gusty showers sweeping from nowhere down upon the
                        distracted fugitives, and above all the ominous, throbbing, pulsating roar
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0236" n="197"/> as of a mighty chorus of cataracts. It came nearer and
                        nearer. It filled the great vault of the sky with a rush as of colossal
                        wing-beats. Then there came a deafening creaking and crashing; then a huge

                    <p>IT was the morning after the disaster. The sun rose red and threatening,
                        circled with a ring of fiery mist. People encamped upon the hill-side
                        greeted each other as on the morn of resurrection. For many were found among
                        the living who were being mourned as dead. Mothers hugged their children
                        with tearful joy, thanking God that they had been spared; and husbands who
                        had heard through the night the agonized cries of their drowning wives,
                        finding them at dawn safe and sound, felt as if they had recovered them from
                        the very gates of death. When all were counted, it was ascertained that but
                        very few of the villagers had been overtaken by the flood. The timely
                        warning had enabled all to save themselves, except some who in their
                        eagerness to rescue their goods had lingered too long. Impoverished <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0237" n="198"/> most of them were by the loss of their houses and cattle. The
                        calamity was indeed overwhelming. But when they considered how much greater
                        the disaster would have been if the flood had come upon them unheralded,
                        they felt that they had cause for gratitude in the midst of their sorrow.
                        And who was it that brought the tidings that snatched them from the jaws of
                        death? Well, nobody knew. He rode too fast. And each was too much startled
                        by the message to take note of the messenger. But who could he possibly have
                        been? An angel from Heaven, perhaps sent by God in His mercy. That was
                        indeed more than likely. The belief was at once accepted that the rescuer
                        was an angel from heaven. But just then a lumberman stepped forward who had
                        worked at the mill and said: "It was Bonnyboy, Grim Carpenter's son. I saw
                        him jump on his gray colt." </p>
                    <p>Bonnyboy, Grim Carpenter's son. It couldn't be possible. But the lumberman
                        insisted that it was, and they had to believe him, though, of course, it was
                        a disappointment. But where was Bonnyboy? He deserved thanks, surely. And,
                        moreover, that gray colt was a valuable animal. It was to be hoped that it
                        was not drowned. </p>
                    <p>The water had now subsided, though it yet overflowed the banks; so that
                        trees, bent and splintered by the terrific force of the flood, grew far out
                        in the river. The foul dams had all been swept away, <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0238" n="199"/> and the
                        tawny torrent ran again with tumultuous rapids in its old channel. Of the
                        mills scarcely a vestige was left except slight cavities in the banks, and a
                        few twisted beams clinging to the rocks where they had stood. The ruins of
                        the village, with jagged chimneys and broken walls, loomed out of a
                        half-inundated meadow, through which erratic currents were sweeping. Here
                        and there lay a dead cow or dog, and in the branches of a maple-tree the
                        carcasses of two sheep were entangled. In this marshy field a stooping
                        figure was seen wading about, as if in search of something. The water broke
                        about his knees, and sometimes reached up to his waist. He stood like one
                        dazed, and stared into the brown swirling torrent. Now he poked something
                        with his boat-hook, now bent down and purled some dead thing out of a copse
                        of shrubbery in which it had been caught. The sun rose higher in the sky,
                        and the red vapors were scattered. But still the old man trudged wearily
                        about, with the stony stare in his eyes, searching for him whom he had lost.
                        One company after another now descended from the hill-sides, and from the
                        high-lying farms which had not been reached by the flood came wagons with
                        provisions and clothes, and men and women eager and anxious to help. They
                        shouted to the old man in the submerged field, and asked what he was looking
                        for. But he only shook his head, as if he did not understand. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0239" n="200"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Why, that is old Grim the carpenter," said someone. "Has anybody seen
                        Bonnyboy?" </p>
                    <p>But no one had seen Bonnyboy. </p>
                    <p>"Do you want help?" they shouted to Grim; but they got no answer. </p>
                    <p>Hour after hour old Grim trudged about in the chilly water searching for his
                        son. Then, about noon, when he had worked his way far down the river, he
                        caught sight of something which made his heart stand still. In a brown pool,
                        in which a half-submerged willow-tree grew, he saw a large grayish shape
                        which resembled a horse. He stretched out the boat-hook and rolled it over.
                        Dumbly, fearlessly, he stood staring into the pool. There lay his
                        son&mdash;there lay Bonnyboy stark and dead. </p>
                    <p>The cold perspiration broke out upon Grim's brow, and his great breast
                        labored. Slowly he stooped down, drew the dead body out of the water, and
                        tenderly laid it across his knees. He stared into the sightless eyes, and
                        murmuring a blessing, closed them. There was a large discolored spot on the
                        forehead, as of a bruise. Grim laid his hand softly upon it, and stroked
                        away the yellow tuft of hair. </p>
                    <p>"My poor lad," he said, while the tears coursed down his wrinkled cheeks,
                        "you had a weak head, but your heart, Bonnyboy&mdash;your heart was
                        good."</p>

                <head> THE CHILD OF LUCK </head>

                <div2 id="d38" n="1" type="section">
                    <head> I. </head>

                    <p>A SUNNY-TEMPERED little fellow was Hans, and his father declared that he had
                        brought luck with him when he came into the world. </p>
                    <p>"He was such a handsome baby when he was born," said Inga, his mother; "but
                        you would scarcely believe it now, running about as he does in forest and
                        field, tearing his clothes and scratching his face." </p>
                    <p>Now, it was true, as Hans's mother said, that he did often tear his clothes;
                        and as he had an indomitable curiosity, and had to investigate everything
                        that came in his way, it was also no uncommon thing for him to come home
                        with his face stung or scratched. </p>
                    <p>"Why must you drag that child with you wherever you go, Nils?" the mother
                        complained to Hans's father, when the little boy was brought to her in such
                        a disreputable condition. "Why can't you leave him at home? What other man
                        do you <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0241" n="202"/> know who carries a six-year-old little fellow about
                        with him in rain and shine, storm and quiet?" </p>
                    <p>"Well," Nils invariably answered, "I like him and he likes me. He brings me
                        luck." </p>
                    <p>This was a standing dispute between Nils and Inga, his wife, and they never
                        came to an agreement. She knew as well as her husband that before little
                        Hans was born there was want and misery in their cottage. But from the hour
                        the child lifted up its tiny voice, announcing its arrival, there had been
                        prosperity and contentment. Their luck had turned, Nils said, and it was the
                        child that had turned it. They had been married for four years, and though
                        they had no one to provide for but themselves, they scarcely managed to keep
                        body and soul together. All sorts of untoward things happened. Now a tree
                        which he was cutting down fell upon Nils and laid him up for a month; now he
                        got water on his knee from a blow he received while rolling logs into the
                        chute; now the pig died which was to have provided them with salt pork for
                        the winter, and the hens took to the bush, and laid their eggs where nobody
                        except the rats and the weasels could find them. But since little Hans had
                        come and put an end to all these disasters, his father had a superstitious
                        feeling that he could not bear to have him away from him. Therefore every
                        morning when he started out for the forest or the river he carried Hans on
                        his shoulder. And the <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0242" n="203"/> little boy sat there, smiling proudly
                        and waving his hand to his mother, who stood in the door looking longingly
                        after him. </p>
                    <p>"Hello, little chap!" cried the lumbermen, when they saw him. "Good-morning
                        to you and good luck!" </p>
                    <p>They always cheered up, however bad the weather was, when they saw little
                        Hans, for nobody could look at his sunny little face without feeling
                        something like a ray of sunlight stealing into his heart. Hans had a smile
                        and a wave of his hand for everybody. He knew all the lumbermen by name, and
                        they knew him. They sang as they swung the axe or the boat-hook, and the
                        work went merrily when little Hans sat on the top of the log pile and
                        shouted to them. But if by chance he was absent for a day or two they missed
                        him. No songs were heard, but harsh words, and not infrequently quarrels.
                        Now, nobody believed, of course, that little Hans was such a wizard that he
                        could make people feel and behave any better than it was in their nature to
                        do; but sure it was&mdash;at least the lumbermen insisted that it was
                        so&mdash;there was joy and good-tempered mirth wherever that child went,
                        and life seemed a little sadder and poorer to those who knew him when he was
                        away. </p>
                    <p>No one will wonder that Nils sometimes boasted of his little son. He told not
                        once, but a hundred times, as they sat about the camp-fire eating their <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0243" n="204"/> dinner, that little Hans was a child of luck, and that no
                        misfortune could happen while he was near. Lumbermen are naturally
                        superstitious, and though perhaps at first they may have had their doubts,
                        they gradually came to accept the statement without question. They came to
                        regard it as a kind of right to have little Hans sit on the top of the log
                        pile when they worked, or running along the chute, while the wild-cat
                        strings of logs shot down the steep slide with lightning speed. They were
                        not in the least afraid lest the logs should jump the chute, as they had
                        often done before, killing or maiming the unhappy man that came too near.
                        For was not little Hans's life charmed, so that no harm could befall him? </p>
                    <p>Now, it happened that Inga, little Hans's mother, came one day to the river
                        to see how he was getting on. Nils was then standing on a raft hooking the
                        floating logs with his boat-hook, while the boy was watching him from the
                        shore, shouting to him, throwing chips into the water, and amusing himself
                        as best he could. It was early in May, and the river was swollen from recent
                        thaws. Below the cataract where the lumbermen worked, the broad, brown
                        current moved slowly along with sluggish whirls and eddies; but the raft was
                        moored by chains to the shore, so that it was in no danger of getting
                        adrift. It was capital fun to see the logs come rushing down the slide,
                        plunging with a tremendous <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0244" n="205"/> splash into the river, and then bob
                        up like live things after having bumped against the bottom. Little Hans
                        clapped his hands and yelled with delight when a string of three or four
                        came tearing along in that way, and dived, one after the other, headlong
                        into the water. </p>
                    <p>"Catch that one, papa!" he cried; "that is a good big fellow. He dived like a
                        man, he did. He has washed the dirt off his snout now; that was the reason
                        he took such a big plunge." </p>
                    <p>Nils never failed to reach his boat-hook after the log little Hans indicated,
                        for he liked to humor him, and little Hans liked to be humored. He had an
                        idea that he was directing his father's work, and Nils invented all sorts of
                        innocent devices to flatter little Hans's dignity, and make him think
                        himself indispensable. It was of no use, therefore, for poor Inga to beg
                        little Hans to go home with her. He had so much to do, he said, that he
                        couldn't. He even tried to tear himself away from his mother when she took
                        him by the arm and remonstrated with him. And then and there the conviction
                        stole upon Inga that her child did not love her. She was nothing to him
                        compared to what his father was. And was it right for Nils thus to rob her
                        of the boy's affection? Little Hans could scarcely be blamed for loving his
                        father better; for love is largely dependent upon habit, and Nils had been
                        his constant companion since he was a year old. A <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0245" n="206"/> bitter sense
                        of loneliness and loss overcame the poor wife as she stood on the river-bank
                        pleading with her child, and finding that she annoyed instead of moving him. </p>
                    <p>"Won't you come home with mamma, little Hans?" she asked, tearfully. "The
                        kitten misses you very much; it has been mewing for you all the morning." </p>
                    <p>"No," said little Hans, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and turning
                        about with a manly stride; "we are going to have the lumber inspector here
                        to-day? and then papa's big raft is going down the river." </p>
                    <p>"But this dreadful noise, dear; how can you stand it? And the logs shooting
                        down that slide and making such a racket. And these great piles of lumber,
                        Hans&mdash;think, if they should tumble down and kill you!" </p>
                    <p>"Oh, I'm not afraid, mamma," cried Hans, proudly; and, to show his
                        fearlessness, he climbed up the log pile, and soon stood on the top of it,
                        waving his cap and shouting. </p>
                    <p>"Oh, do come down, child&mdash;do come down!" begged Inga, anxiously. </p>
                    <p>She had scarcely uttered the words when she heard a warning shout from the
                        slope above, and had just time to lift her eyes, when she saw a big black
                        object dart past her, strike the log pile, and break with a deafening crash.
                        A long confused <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0246" n="207"/> rumble of rolling logs followed, terrified
                        voices rent the air, and, above it all, the deep and steady roar of the
                        cataract. She saw, as through a fog, little Hans, serene and smiling as
                        ever, borne down on the top of the rolling lumber, now rising up and
                        skipping from log to log, now clapping his hands and screaming with
                        pleasure, and then suddenly vanishing in the brown writhing river. His
                        laughter was still ringing in her ears; the poor child, he did not realize
                        his danger. The rumbling of falling logs continued with terrifying
                        persistence. Splash! splash! splash! they went, diving by twos, by fours,
                        and by dozens at the very spot where her child had vanished. But where was
                        little Hans? Oh, where was he? It was all so misty, so unreal and confused.
                        She could not tell whether little Hans was among the living or among the
                        dead. But there, all of a sudden, his head popped up in the middle of the
                        river; and there was another head close to his&mdash;it was that of his
                        father! And round about them other heads bobbed up; for all the lumbermen
                        who were on the raft had plunged into the water with Nils when they saw that
                        little Hans was in danger. A dozen more were running down the slope as fast
                        as their legs could carry them; and they gave a tremendous cheer when they
                        saw little Hans's face above the water. He looked a trifle pale and shivery,
                        and he gave a funny little snort, so that the water spurted <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0247" n="208"/>
                        from his nose. He had lost his hat, but he did not seem to be hurt. His
                        little arms clung tightly about his father's neck, while Nils, dodging the
                        bobbing logs, struck out with all his might for the shore. And when he felt
                        firm bottom under his feet, and came stumbling up through the shallow water,
                        looking like a drowned rat, what a welcome he received from the lumbermen!
                        They all wanted to touch little Hans and pat his cheek, just to make sure
                        that it was really he. </p>
                    <p>"It was wonderful indeed," they said, "that he ever came up out of that
                        horrible jumble of pitching and diving logs. He is a child of luck, if ever
                        there was one." </p>
                    <p>Not one of them thought of the boy's mother, and little Hans himself scarcely
                        thought of her, elated as he was at the welcome he received from the
                        lumbermen. Poor Inga stood dazed, struggling with a horrible feeling, seeing
                        her child passed from one to the other, while she herself claimed no share
                        in him. Somehow the thought stung her. A sudden clearness burst upon her;
                        she rushed forward, with a piercing scream, snatched little Hans from his
                        father's arms, and hugging his wet little shivering form to her breast, fled
                        like a deer through the underbrush. </p>
                    <p>From that day little Hans was not permitted to go to the river. It was in
                        vain that Nils pleaded and threatened. His wife acted so unreasonably <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0248" n="209"/> when that question was broached that he saw it was useless to
                        discuss it. She seized little Hans as a tigress might seize her young, and
                        held him tightly clasped, as if daring anybody to take him away from her.
                        Nils knew it would require force to get his son back again, and that he was
                        not ready to employ. But all joy seemed to have gone out of his life since
                        he had lost the daily companionship of little Hans. His work became
                        drudgery; and all the little annoyances of life, which formerly he had
                        brushed away as one brushes a fly from his nose, became burdens and
                        calamities. The raft upon which he had expended so much labor went to pieces
                        during a sudden rise of the river the night after little Hans's adventure,
                        and three days later Thorkel Fossen was killed outright by a string of logs
                        that jumped the chute. </p>
                    <p>"It isn't the same sort of place since you took little Hans away," the
                        lumbermen would often say to Nils. "There's no sort of luck in anything." </p>
                    <p>Sometimes they taunted him with want of courage, and called him a "night-cap"
                        and a "hen-pecked coon," all of which made Nils uncomfortable. He made two
                        or three attempts to persuade his wife to change her mind in regard to
                        little Hans, but the last time she got so frightened that she ran out of the
                        house and hid in the cow stable with the boy, crouching in an empty stall,
                        and crying as if her heart would break, when little Hans escaped and <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0249" n="210"/> betrayed her hiding-place. The boy, in fact, sympathized with
                        his father, and found his confinement at home irksome. The companionship of
                        the cat had no more charm for him; and even the brindled calf, which had
                        caused such an excitement when he first arrived, had become an old story.
                        Little Halls fretted, was mischievous for want of better employment, and
                        gave his mother no end of trouble. He longed for the gay and animated life
                        at the river, and he would have run away if he had not been watched. He
                        could not imagine how the lumbermen could be getting on without him. It
                        seemed to him that all work must come to a stop when he was no longer
                        sitting on the top of the log piles, or standing on the bank throwing chips
                        into the water. </p>
                    <p>Now, as a matter of fact, they were not getting on very well at the river
                        without little Hans. The luck had deserted them, the lumbermen said; and
                        whatever mishaps they had, they attributed to the absence of little Hans.
                        They came to look with ill-suppressed hostility at Nils, whom they regarded
                        as responsible for their misfortunes. For they could scarcely believe that
                        he was quite in earnest in his desire for the boy's return, otherwise they
                        could not comprehend how his wife could dare to oppose him. The weather was
                        stormy, and the mountain brook which ran along the slide concluded to waste
                        no more labor in carving out a bed for itself in the rock, when it might as
                        well be using the slide which <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0250" n="211"/> it found ready made. And one
                        fine day it broke into the slide and half filled it, so that the logs, when
                        they were started down the steep incline, sent the water flying, turned
                        somersaults, stood on end, and played no end of dangerous tricks which no
                        one could foresee. Several men were badly hurt by beams shooting like
                        rockets through the air, and old Mads Furubakken was knocked senseless and
                        carried home for dead. Then the lumbermen held a council, and made up their
                        minds to get little Hans by fair means or foul. They thought first of
                        sending a delegation of four or five men that very morning, but finally
                        determined to march up to Nils's cottage in a body and demand the boy. There
                        were twenty of them at the very least, and the tops of their long
                        boat-hooks, which they carried on their shoulders, were seen against the
                        green forest before they were themselves visible. </p>
                    <p>Nils, who was just out of bed, was sitting on the threshold smoking his pipe
                        and pitching a ball to little Hans, who laughed with delight whenever he
                        caught it. Inga was bustling about inside the house, preparing breakfast,
                        which was to consist of porridge, salt herring, and baked potatoes. It had
                        rained during the night, and the sky was yet overcast, but the sun was
                        struggling to break through the cloud-banks. A couple of thrushes in the
                        alder-bushes about the cottage were rejoicing at the change in the weather,
                        and Nils was listening to <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0251" n="212"/> their song and to his son's merry
                        prattle, when he caught sight of the twenty lumbermen marching up the
                        hillside. He rose, with some astonishment, and went to meet them. Inga,
                        hearing their voices, came to the door, and seeing the many men, snatched up
                        little Hans, and with a wildly palpitating heart ran into the cottage,
                        bolting the door behind her. She had a vague foreboding that this unusual
                        visit meant something hostile to herself, and she guessed that Nils had been
                        only the spokesman of his comrades in demanding so eagerly the return of the
                        boy to the river. She believed all their talk about his luck to be idle
                        nonsense; but she knew that Nils had unwittingly spread this belief, and
                        that the lumbermen were convinced that little Hans was their good genius,
                        whose presence averted disaster. Distracted with fear and anxiety, she stood
                        pressing her ear against the crack in the door, and sometimes peeping out to
                        see what measures she must take for the child's safety. Would Nils stand by
                        her, or would he desert her? But surely&mdash;what was Nils thinking
                        about? He was extending his hand to each of the men, and receiving them
                        kindly. Next he would be inviting them to come in and take little Hans. She
                        saw one of the men&mdash;Stubby Mons by name&mdash;step forward, and
                        she plainly heard him say: </p>
                    <p>"We miss the little chap down at the river, Nils. The luck has been against
                        us since he left." <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0252" n="213"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Well, Mons," Nils answered, "I miss the little chap as much as any of you;
                        perhaps more. But my wife&mdash;she's got a sort of crooked notion that
                        the boy won't come home alive if she lets him go to the river. She got a bad
                        scare last time, and it isn't any use arguing with her." </p>
                    <p>"But won't you let us talk to her, Nils?" one of the lumbermen proposed. "It
                        is a tangled skein, and I don't pretend to say that I can straighten it out.
                        But two men have been killed and one crippled since the little chap was
                        taken away. And in the three years he was with us no untoward thing
                        happened. Now that speaks for itself, Nils, doesn't it?" </p>
                    <p>"It does, indeed," said Nils, with an air of conviction. </p>
                    <p>"And you'll let us talk to your wife, and see if we can't make her listen to
                        reason," the man urged. </p>
                    <p>"You are welcome to talk to her as much as you like," Nils replied, knocking
                        out his pipe on the heel of his boot; "but I warn you that she's mighty
                        cantankerous." </p>
                    <p>He rose slowly, and tried to open the door. It was locked. "Open, Inga," he
                        said, a trifle impatiently; "there are some men here who want to see you."</p>

                    <p>INGA sat crouching on the hearth, hugging little Hans to her bosom. She shook
                        and trembled with fear, let her eyes wander around the walls, and now and
                        then moaned at the thought that now they would take little Hans away from
                        her. </p>
                    <p>"Why don't you open the door for papa?" asked little Hans, wonderingly. </p>
                    <p>Ah, he too was against her! All the world was against her! And her husband
                        was in league with her enemies! </p>
                    <p>"Open, I say!" cried Nils, vehemently. "What do you mean by locking the door
                        when decent people come to call upon us?" </p>
                    <p>Should she open the door or should she not? Holding little Hans in her arms,
                        she rose hesitatingly, and stretched out her hand toward the bolt. But all
                        of a sudden, in a paroxysm of fear, she withdrew her hand, turned about, and
                        fled with the child through the back door. The alder bushes grew close up to
                        the walls of the cottage, and by stooping a little she managed to remain
                        unobserved. Her greatest difficulty was to keep little Hans from shouting to
                        his father, and she had to put her hand over his mouth to keep him quiet;
                        for the boy, who had heard the voices without, could not understand why he
                        should not be permitted to go out and converse <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0254" n="215"/> with his
                        friends the lumbermen. The wild eyes and agitated face of his mother
                        distressed him, and the little showers of last night's rain which the trees
                        shook down upon him made him shiver. </p>
                    <p>"Why do you run so, mamma?" he asked, when she removed her hand from his
                        mouth. </p>
                    <p>"Because the bad men want to take you away from me, Hans," she answered,
                        panting. </p>
                    <p>"Those were not bad men, mamma," the boy ejaculated. "That was Stubby Mons
                        and Stuttering Peter and Lars Skin-breeches. They don't, want to hurt me." </p>
                    <p>He expected that his mamma would be much relieved at receiving this valuable
                        information, and return home without delay. But she still pressed on,
                        flushed and panting, and cast the same anxious glances behind her. </p>
                    <p>In the meanwhile Nils and his guests had entirely lost their patience.
                        Finding his persuasions of no avail, the former began to thump at the door
                        with the handle of his axe, and receiving no response, he climbed up to the
                        window and looked in. To his amazement there was no one in the room.
                        Thinking that Inga might have gone to the cow-stable, he ran to the rear of
                        the cottage, and called her name. Still no answer. </p>
                    <p>"Hans," he cried, "where are you?" </p>
                    <p>But Hans, too, was as if spirited away. It scarcely occurred to Nils, until
                        he had searched the cow-stable <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0255" n="216"/> and the house in vain, that his
                        wife had fled from the harmless lumbermen. Then the thought shot through his
                        brain that possibly she was not quite right in her head; that this fixed
                        idea that everybody wanted to take her child away from her had unsettled her
                        reason. Nils grew hot and cold in the same moment as this dreadful
                        apprehension took lodgement in his mind. Might she not, in her confused
                        effort to save little Hans, do him harm? In the blind and feverish terror
                        which possessed her might she not rush into the water, or leap over a
                        precipice? Visions of little Hans drowning, or whirled into the abyss in his
                        mother's arms, crowded his fancy as he walked back to the lumbermen, and
                        told them that neither his wife nor child was anywhere to be found. </p>
                    <p>"I would ask ye this, lads," he said, finally: "if you would help me search
                        for them. For Inga&mdash;I reckon she is a little touched in the upper
                        story&mdash;she has gone off with the boy, and I can't get on without
                        little Hans any more than you can." </p>
                    <p>The men understood the situation at a glance, and promised their aid. They
                        had all looked upon Inga as "high-strung" and "queer," and it did not
                        surprise them to hear that she had been frightened out of her wits at their
                        request for the loan of little Hans. Forming a line, with a space of twenty
                        feet between each man, they began to beat the bush, climbing the steep slope
                        toward the mountains. <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0256" n="217"/> Inga, pausing for an instant, and
                        peering out between the tree trunks, saw the alder bushes wave as they broke
                        through the underbrush. She knew now that she was pursued. Tired she was,
                        too, and the boy grew heavier for every step that she advanced. And yet if
                        she made him walk, he might run away from her. If he heard his father's
                        voice, he would be certain to answer. Much perplexed, she looked about her
                        for a hiding-place. For, as the men would be sure to overtake her, her only
                        safety was in hiding. With tottering knees she stumbled along, carrying the
                        heavy child, grabbing hold of the saplings for support, and yet scarcely
                        keeping from falling. The cold perspiration broke from her brow and a
                        strange faintness overcame her. </p>
                    <p>"You will have to walk, little Hans," she said, at last. "But if you run away
                        from me, dear, I shall lie down here and die." </p>
                    <p>Little Hans promised that he would not run away, and for five minutes they
                        walked up a stony path which looked like the abandoned bed of a brook. </p>
                    <p>"You hurt my hand, mamma," whimpered the boy, "you squeeze so hard." </p>
                    <p>She would have answered, but just then she heard the voices of the lumbermen
                        scarcely fifty paces away. With a choking sensation and a stitch in her side
                        she pressed on, crying out in spirit for the hills to hide her and the
                        mountains to open <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0257" n="218"/> their gates and receive her. Suddenly she
                        stood before a rocky wall some eighty or a hundred feet high. She could go
                        no farther. Her strength was utterly exhausted. There was a big boulder
                        lying at the base of the rock, and a spreading juniper half covered it.
                        Knowing that in another minute she would be discovered, she flung herself
                        down behind the boulder, though the juniper needles scratched her face, and
                        pulled little Hans down at her side. But, strange to say, little Hans fell
                        farther than she had calculated, and utterly-vanished from sight. She heard
                        a muffled cry, and reaching her hand in the direction where he had fallen,
                        caught hold of his arm. A strong, wild smell beat against her, and little
                        Hans, as he was pulled out, was enveloped in a most unpleasant odor. But
                        odor or no odor, here was the very hiding-place she had been seeking. A
                        deserted wolf's den, it was, probably&mdash;at least she hoped it was
                        deserted; for if it was not, she might be confronted with even uglier
                        customers than the lumbermen. But she had no time for debating the question,
                        for she saw the head of Stubby Mons emerging from the leaves, and
                        immediately behind him came Stuttering Peter, with his long boat-hook. Quick
                        as a flash she slipped into the hole, and dragged Hans after her. The
                        juniper-bush entirely covered the entrance. She could see everyone who
                        approached, without being seen. Unhappily, <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0258" n="219"/> the boy too caught
                        sight of Stubby Mons, and called him by name. The lumberman stopped and
                        pricked up his ears. </p>
                    <p>"Did you hear anybody call?" he asked his companion. </p>
                    <p>"N-n-n-n-aw, I d-d-d-d-didn't," answered Stuttering Peter. "There b-be lots
                        of qu-qu-qu-qu-eer n-noises in the w-w-w-woods." </p>
                    <p>Little Hans heard every word that they spoke, and he would have cried out
                        again, if it hadn't appeared such great fun to be playing hide-and-go-seek
                        with the lumbermen. He had a delicious sense of being well hidden, and had
                        forgotten everything except the zest of the game. Most exciting it became
                        when Stubby Mons drew the juniper-bush aside and peered eagerly behind the
                        boulder. Inga's heart stuck in her throat; she felt sure that in the next
                        instant they would be discovered. And as ill-luck would have it, there was
                        something alive scrambling about her feet and tugging at her skirts.
                        Suddenly she felt a sharp bite, but clinched her teeth, and uttered no
                        sound. When her vision again cleared, the juniper branch had rebounded into
                        its place, and the face of Stubby Mons was gone. She drew a deep breath of
                        relief, but yet did not dare to emerge from the den. For one, two, three
                        tremulous minutes she remained motionless, feeling all the while that
                        uncomfortable sensation of living things about her. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0259" n="220"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>At last she could endure it no longer. Thrusting little Hans before her, she
                        crawled out of the hole, and looked back into the small cavern. As soon as
                        her eyes grew accustomed to the twilight she uttered a cry of amazement, for
                        out from her skirts jumped a little gray furry object, and two frisky little
                        customers of the same sort were darting about among the stones and
                        tree-roots. The truth dawned upon her, and it chilled her to the marrow of
                        her bones. The wolf's den was not deserted. The old folks were only out
                        hunting, and the shouting and commotion of the searching party had probably
                        prevented them from returning in time to look after their family. She seized
                        little Hans by the hand, and once more dragged him away over the rough path.
                        He soon became tired and fretful, and in spite of all her entreaties began
                        to shout lustily for his father. But the men were now so far away that they
                        could not hear him. He complained of hunger; and when presently they came to
                        a blueberry patch, she flung herself down on the heather and allowed him to
                        pick berries. She heard cow-bells and sheep-bells tinkling round about her,
                        and concluded that she could not be far from the <hi rend="italic"
                        >saeters</hi>, or mountain dairies. That was fortunate, indeed, for she
                        would not have liked to sleep in the woods with wolves and bears prowling
                        about her. </p>
                    <p>She was just making an effort to rise from the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002438_0260" n="221"/> stone upon which
                        she was sitting, when the big, good-natured face of a cow broke through the
                        leaves and stared at her. There was again help in need. She approached the
                        cow, patted it, and calling little Hans, bade him sit down in the heather
                        and open his mouth. He obeyed rather wonderingly, but perceived his mother's
                        intent when she knelt at his side and began to milk into his mouth. It
                        seemed to him that he had never tasted anything so delicious as this fresh
                        rich milk, fragrant with the odor of the woods and the succulent mountain
                        grass. When his hunger was satisfied, he fell again to picking berries,
                        while Inga refreshed herself with milk in the same simple fashion. After
                        having rested a full hour, she felt strong enough to continue her journey;
                        and hearing the <hi rend="italic">loor</hi>, or Alpine horn, re-echoing
                        among the mountains, she determined to follow the sound. It was singular
                        what luck attended her in the midst of her misfortune. Perhaps it was, after
                        all, no idle tale that little Hans was a child of luck; and she had done the
                        lumbermen injustice in deriding their faith in him. Perhaps there was some
                        guiding Providence in all that had happened, destined in the end to lead
                        little Hans to fortune and glory. Much encouraged by this thought, she
                        stooped over him and kissed him; then took his hand and trudged along over
                        logs and stones, through juniper and bramble bushes. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0261" n="222"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Mamma," said little Hans, "where are you going?" </p>
                    <p>"I am going to the <hi rend="italic">saeter</hi>," she answered; "where you
                        have wanted so often to go." </p>
                    <p>"Then why don't you follow the cows? They are going there too." </p>
                    <p>Surely that child had a marvellous mind! She smiled down upon him and nodded.
                        By following the cows they arrived in twenty minutes at a neat little log
                        cabin, from which the smoke curled up gayly into the clear air. </p>
                    <p>The dairy-maids who spent the summer there tending the cattle both fell
                        victims to the charms of little Hans, and offered him and his mother their
                        simple hospitality. They told of the lumbermen who had passed the <hi
                            rend="italic">saeter</hi> huts, and inquired for her; but otherwise they
                        respected her silence, and made no attempt to pry into her secrets. The next
                        morning she started, after a refreshing sleep, westward toward the coast,
                        where she hoped in some way to find a passage to America. For if little Hans
                        was really born under a lucky star&mdash;which fact she now could
                        scarcely doubt&mdash;then America was the place for him. There he might
                        rise to become President, or a judge, or a parson, or something or other;
                        while in Norway he would never be anything but a lumberman like his father.
                        Inga had a well-to-do sister, who was a widow, in the nearest town, and she
                        would borrow <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0262" n="223"/> enough money from her to pay their passage to New
                        York. </p>
                    <p>It was early in July when little Hans and his mother arrived in New York. The
                        latter had repented bitterly of her rashness in stealing her child from his
                        father, and under a blind impulse traversing half the globe in a wild-goose
                        chase after fortune. The world was so much bigger than she in her quiet
                        valley had imagined; and, what was worse, it wore such a cold and repellent
                        look, and was so bewildering and noisy. Inga had been very sea-sick during
                        the voyage; and after she stepped ashore from the tug that brought her to
                        Castle Garden, the ground kept heaving and swelling under her feet, and made
                        her dizzy and miserable. She had been very wicked, she was beginning to
                        think, and deserved punishment; and if it had not been for a vague and
                        adventurous faith in the great future that was in store for her son, she
                        would have been content to return home, do penance for her folly, and beg
                        her husband's forgiveness. But, in the first place, she had no money to pay
                        for a return ticket; and, secondly, it would be a great pity to deprive
                        little Hans of the Presidency and all the grandeur that his lucky star might
                        here bring him. </p>
                    <p>Inga was just contemplating this bright vision of Hans's future, when she
                        found herself passing through a gate, at which a clerk was seated. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0263" n="224"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"What is your name?" he asked, through an interpreter. </p>
                    <p>"Inga Olsdatter Pladsen." </p>
                    <p>"Age?" </p>
                    <p>"Twenty-eight a week after Michaelmas." </p>
                    <p>"Single or married?" </p>
                    <p>"Married." </p>
                    <p>"Where is your husband?" </p>
                    <p>"In Norway." </p>
                    <p>"Are you divorced from him?" </p>
                    <p>"Divorced&mdash;I! Why, no! Who ever heard of such a thing?" </p>
                    <p>Inga grew quite indignant at the thought of her being divorced. A dozen other
                        questions were asked, at each of which her embarrassment increased. When,
                        finally, she declared that she had no money, no definite destination, and no
                        relatives or friends in the country, the examination was cut short, and
                        after an hour's delay and a wearisome cross-questioning by different
                        officials, she was put on board the tug, and returned to the steamer in
                        which she had crossed the ocean. Four dreary days passed; then there was a
                        tremendous commotion on deck: blowing of whistles, roaring of steam, playing
                        of bands, bumping of trunks and boxes, and finally the steady pulsation of
                        the engines as the big ship stood out to sea. After nine days of discomfort
                        in the stuffy steerage and thirty-six hours of downright misery while
                        crossing the stormy <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0264" n="225"/> North Sea, Inga found herself once more in
                        the land of her birth. Full of humiliation and shame she met her husband at
                        the railroad station, and prepared herself for a deluge of harsh words and
                        reproaches. But instead of that he patted her gently on the head, and
                        clasped little Hans in his arms and kissed him. They said very little to
                        each other as they rode homeward in the cars; but little Hans had a thousand
                        things to tell, and his father was delighted to hear them. In the evening,
                        when they had reached their native valley, and the boy was asleep, Inga
                        plucked up courage and said, "Nils, it is all a mistake about little Hans's
                        luck." </p>
                    <p>"Mistake! Why, no," cried Nils. "What greater luck could he have than to be
                        brought safely home to his father?" </p>
                    <p>Inga had indeed hoped for more; but she said nothing. Nevertheless, fate
                        still had strange things in store for little Hans. The story of his mother's
                        flight to and return from America was picked up by some enterprising
                        journalist, who made a most touching romance of it. Hundreds of inquiries
                        regarding little Hans poured in upon the pastor and the postmaster; and
                        offers to adopt him, educate him, and I know not what else, were made to his
                        parents. But Nils would hear of no adoption; nor would he consent to any
                        plan that separated him from the boy. When, however, he was given <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0265" n="226"/> a position as superintendent of a lumber yard in the town, and
                        prosperity began to smile upon him, he sent little Hans to school, and as
                        Hans was a clever boy, he made the most of his opportunities. </p>
                    <p>And now little Hans is indeed a very big Hans, but a child of luck he is yet;
                        for I saw him referred to the other day in the newspapers as one of the
                        greatest lumber dealers, and one of the noblest, most generous, and
                        public-spirited men in Norway.</p>

                <head> THE BEAR THAT HAD A BANK ACCOUNT </head>

                    <head> I. </head>

                    <p>YOU may not believe it, but the bear I am going to tell you about really had
                        a bank account! He lived in the woods, as most bears do; but he had a
                        reputation which extended over all Norway and more than half of England.
                        Earls and baronets came every summer, with repeating-rifles of the latest
                        patent, and plaids and field-glasses and portable cooking-stoves, intent
                        upon killing him. But Mr. Bruin, whose only weapons were a pair of paws and
                        a pair of jaws, both uncommonly good of their kind, though not patented,
                        always managed to get away unscathed; and that was sometimes more than the
                        earls and the baronets did. </p>
                    <p>One summer the Crown Prince of Germany came to Norway. He also heard of the
                        famous bear that no one could kill, and made up his mind that he was the man
                        to kill it. He trudged for two days through bogs, and climbed through glens
                        and ravines, before he came on the scent of a bear, <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0267" n="228"/> and a
                        bear's scent, you may know, is strong, and quite unmistakable. Finally he
                        discovered some tracks in the moss, like those of a barefooted man, or, I
                        should rather say, perhaps, a man-footed bear. The Prince was just turning
                        the corner of a projecting rock, when he saw a huge, shaggy beast standing
                        on its hind legs, examining in a leisurely manner the inside of a hollow
                        tree, while a swarm of bees were buzzing about its ears. It was just hauling
                        out a handful of honey, and was smiling with a grewsome mirth, when His
                        Royal Highness sent it a bullet right in the breast, where its heart must
                        have been, if it had one. But, instead of falling down flat, as it ought to
                        have done, out of deference to the Prince, it coolly turned its back, and
                        gave its assailant a disgusted nod over its shoulder as it trudged away
                        through the underbrush. The attendants ranged through the woods and beat the
                        bushes in all directions, but Mr. Bruin was no more to be seen that
                        afternoon. It was as if he had sunk into the earth; not a trace of him was
                        to be found by either dogs or men. </p>
                    <p>From that time forth the rumor spread abroad that this Gausdale Bruin (for
                        that was the name by which he became known) was enchanted. It was said that
                        he shook off bullets as a duck does water; that he had the evil eye, and
                        could bring misfortune to whomsoever he looked upon. The peasants dreaded to
                        meet him, and ceased to hunt him. His <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0268" n="229"/> size was described as
                        something enormous, his teeth, his claws, and his eyes as being diabolical
                        beyond human conception. In the meanwhile Mr. Bruin had it all his own way
                        in the mountains, killed a young bull or a fat heifer for his dinner every
                        day or two, chased in pure sport a herd of sheep over a precipice; and as
                        for Lars Moe's bay mare Stella, he nearly finished her, leaving his
                        claw-marks on her flank in a way that spoiled her beauty forever. </p>
                    <p>Now Lars Moe himself was too old to hunt; and his nephew was&mdash;well,
                        he was not old enough. There was, in fact, no one in the valley who was of
                        the right age to hunt this Gausdale Bruin. It was of no use that Lars Moe
                        egged on the young lads to try their luck, shaming them, or offering them
                        rewards, according as his mood might happen to be. He was the wealthiest man
                        in the valley, and his mare Stella had been the apple of his eye. He felt it
                        as a personal insult that the bear should have dared to molest what belonged
                        to him, especially the most precious of all his possessions. It cut him to
                        the heart to see the poor wounded beauty, with those cruel scratches on her
                        thigh, and one stiff, aching leg done up in oil and cotton. When he opened
                        the stable-door, and was greeted by Stella's low, friendly neighing, or when
                        she limped forward in her box-stall and put her small, clean-shaped head on
                        his shoulder, then Lars Moe's heart swelled <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0269" n="230"/> until it seemed on
                        the point of breaking. And so it came to pass that he added a codicil to his
                        will, setting aside five hundred dollars of his estate as a reward to the
                        man who, within six years, should kill the Gausdale Bruin. </p>
                    <p>Soon after that, Lars Moe died, as some said, from grief and chagrin; though
                        the physician affirmed that it was of rheumatism of the heart. At any rate,
                        the codicil relating to the enchanted bear was duly read before the church
                        door, and pasted, among other legal notices, in the vestibules of the
                        judge's and the sheriff's offices. When the executors had settled up the
                        estate, the question arose in whose name or to whose credit should be
                        deposited the money which was to be set aside for the benefit of the
                        bear-slayer. No one knew who would kill the bear, or if any one would kill
                        it. It was a puzzling question. </p>
                    <p>"Why, deposit it to the credit of the bear," said a jocose executor; "then,
                        in the absence of other heirs, his slayer will inherit it. That is good old
                        Norwegian practice, though I don't know whether it has ever been the law." </p>
                    <p>"All right," said the other executors, "so long as it is understood who is to
                        have the money, it does not matter." </p>
                    <p>And so an amount equal to $500 was deposited in the county bank to the credit
                        of the Gausdale Bruin. Sir Barry Worthington, Bart., who came <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0270" n="231"/>
                        abroad the following summer for the shooting, heard the story, and thought
                        it a good one. So, after having vainly tried to earn the prize himself, he
                        added another $500 to the deposit, with the stipulation that he was to have
                        the skin. </p>
                    <p>But his rival for parliamentary honors, Robert Stapleton, Esq., the great
                        iron-master, who had come to Norway chiefly to outshine Sir Barry,
                        determined that he was to have the skin of that famous bear, if any one was
                        to have it, and that, at all events, Sir Barry should not have it. So Mr.
                        Stapleton added $750 to the bear's bank account, with the stipulation that
                        the skin should come to him. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Bruin, in the meanwhile, as if to resent this unseemly contention about
                        his pelt, made worse havoc among the herds than ever, and compelled several
                        peasants to move their dairies to other parts of the mountains, where the
                        pastures were poorer, but where they would be free from his depredations. If
                        the $1,750 in the bank had been meant as a bribe or a stipend for good
                        behavior, such as was formerly paid to Italian brigands, it certainly could
                        not have been more demoralizing in its effect; for all agreed that, since
                        Lars Moe's death, Bruin misbehaved worse than ever.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0271" n="232"/>

                </div2>
                <div2 id="d42" n="2" type="section">
                    <head> II. </head>

                    <p>THERE was an odd clause in Lars Moe's will besides the codicil relating to
                        the bear. It read: </p>
                    <p>"I hereby give and bequeath to my daughter Unna, or, in case of her decease,
                        to her oldest living issue, my bay mare Stella, as a token that I have
                        forgiven her the sorrow she caused me by her marriage." </p>
                    <p>It seemed incredible that Lars Moe should wish to play a practical joke (and
                        a bad one at that) on his only child, his daughter Unna, because she had
                        displeased him by her marriage. Yet that was the common opinion in the
                        valley when this singular clause became known. Unna had married Thorkel
                        Tomlevold, a poor tenant's son, and had refused her cousin, the great
                        lumber-dealer, Morten Janson, whom her father had selected for a son-in-law. </p>
                    <p>She dwelt now in a tenant's cottage, northward in the parish; and her
                        husband, who was a sturdy and fine-looking fellow, eked out a living by
                        hunting and fishing. But they surely had no accommodations for a
                        broken-down, wounded, trotting mare, which could not even draw a plough. It
                        is true Unna, in the days of her girlhood, had been very fond of the mare,
                        and it is only charitable to suppose that the clause, which was in the body
                        of the will, was written while Stella was in her prime, <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0272" n="233"/> and
                        before she had suffered at the paws of the Gausdale Bruin. But even granting
                        that, one could scarcely help suspecting malice aforethought in the curious
                        provision. To Unna the gift was meant to say, as plainly as possible,
                        "There, you see what you have lost by disobeying your father! If you had
                        married according to his wishes, you would have been able to accept the
                        gift, while now you are obliged to decline it like a beggar." </p>
                    <p>But if it was Lars Moe's intention to convey such a message to his daughter,
                        he failed to take into account his daughter's spirit. She appeared plainly
                        but decently dressed at the reading of the will, and carried her head not a
                        whit less haughtily than was her wont in her maiden days. She exhibited no
                        chagrin when she found that Janson was her father's heir and that she was
                        disinherited. She even listened with perfect composure to the reading of the
                        clause which bequeathed to her the broken-down mare. </p>
                    <p>It at once became a matter of pride with her to accept her girlhood's
                        favorite, and accept it she did! And having borrowed a side-saddle, she rode
                        home, apparently quite contented. A little shed, or lean-to, was built in
                        the rear of the house, and Stella became a member of Thorkel Tomlevold's
                        family. Odd as it may seem, the fortunes of the family took a turn for the
                        better from the day she arrived; Thorkel rarely came home without big <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0273" n="234"/> game, and in his traps he caught more than any three other men
                        in all the parish. </p>
                    <p>"The mare has brought us luck," he said to his wife. "If she can't plough,
                        she can at all events pull the sleigh to church; and you have as good a
                        right as any one to put on airs, if you choose." </p>
                    <p>"Yes, she has brought us blessing," replied Unna, quietly; "and we are going
                        to keep her till she dies of old age." </p>
                    <p>To the children Stella became a pet, as much as if she had been a dog or a
                        cat. The little boy Lars climbed all over her, and kissed her regularly
                        good-morning when she put her handsome head in through the kitchen-door to
                        get her lump of sugar. She was as gentle as a lamb and as intelligent as a
                        dog. Her great brown eyes, with their soft, liquid look, spoke as plainly as
                        words could speak, expressing pleasure when she was patted; and the low
                        neighing with which she greeted the little boy, when she heard his footsteps
                        in the door, was to him like the voice of a friend. He grew to love this
                        handsome and noble animal as he had loved nothing on earth except his father
                        and mother. </p>
                    <p>As a matter of course he heard a hundred times the story of Stella's
                        adventure with the terrible Gausdale bear. It was a story that never lost
                        its interest, that seemed to grow more exciting the oftener it was told. The
                        deep scars of the bear's claws in Stella's thigh were curiously examined,
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0274" n="235"/> and each time gave rise to new questions. The mare became
                        quite a heroic character, and the suggestion was frequently discussed
                        between Lars and his little sister Marit, whether Stella might not be an
                        enchanted princess who was waiting for some one to cut off her head, so that
                        she might show herself in her glory. Marit thought the experiment well worth
                        trying, but Lars had his doubts, and was unwilling to take the risk; yet if
                        she brought luck, as his mother said, then she certainly must be something
                        more than an ordinary horse. </p>
                    <p>Stella had dragged little Lars out of the river when he fell overboard from
                        the pier; and that, too, showed more sense than he had ever known a horse to
                        have. </p>
                    <p>There could be no doubt in his mind that Stella was an enchanted princess.
                        And instantly the thought occurred to him that the dreadful enchanted bear
                        with the evil eye was the sorcerer, and that, when he was killed, Stella
                        would resume her human guise. It soon became clear to him that he was the
                        boy to accomplish this heroic deed; and it was equally plain to him that he
                        must keep his purpose secret from all except Marit, as his mother would
                        surely discourage him from engaging in so perilous an enterprise. First of
                        all, he had to learn how to shoot; and his father, who was the best shot in
                        the valley, was very willing to teach him. It seemed quite natural to
                        Thorkel that a hunter's <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0275" n="236"/> son should take readily to the rifle;
                        and it gave him great satisfaction to see how true his boy's aim was, and
                        how steady his hand. </p>
                    <p>"Father," said Lars one day, "you shoot so well, why haven't you ever tried
                        to kill the Gausdale Bruin that hurt Stella so badly?" </p>
                    <p>"Hush, child! you don't know what you are talking about," answered his
                        father; "no leaden bullet will harm that wicked beast." </p>
                    <p>"Why not?" </p>
                    <p>"I don't like to talk about it&mdash;but it is well known that he is
                        enchanted." </p>
                    <p>"But will he then live for ever? Is there no sort of bullet that will kill
                        him?" asked the boy. </p>
                    <p>"I don't know. I don't want to have anything to do with witchcraft," said
                        Thorkel. </p>
                    <p>The word "witchcraft" set the boy to thinking, and he suddenly remembered
                        that he had been warned not to speak to an old woman named Martha Pladsen,
                        because she was a witch. Now, she was probably the very one who could tell
                        him what he wanted to know. Her cottage lay close up under the
                        mountain-side, about two miles from his home. He did not deliberate long
                        before going to seek this mysterious person, about whom the most remarkable
                        stories were told in the valley. To his astonishment, she received him
                        kindly, gave him a cup of coffee with rock candy, and declared that she had
                        long expected him. The bullet which <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0276" n="237"/> was to slay the enchanted
                        bear had long been in her possession; and she would give it to him if he
                        would promise to give her the beast's heart. He did not have to be asked
                        twice for that; and off he started gayly with his prize in his pocket. It
                        was rather an odd-looking bullet, made of silver, marked with a cross on one
                        side and with a lot of queer illegible figures on the other. It seemed to
                        burn in his pocket, so anxious was he to start out at once to release the
                        beloved Stella from the cruel enchantment. But Martha had said that the bear
                        could only be killed when the moon was full; and until the moon was full he
                        accordingly had to bridle his impatience.</p>

                    <p>IT was a bright morning in January, and, as it happened, Lars's fourteenth
                        birthday. To his great delight, his mother had gone down to the judge's to
                        sell some ptarmigans, and his father had gone to fell some timber up in the
                        glen. Accordingly he could secure the rifle without being observed. He took
                        an affectionate good-by of Stella, who rubbed her soft nose against his own,
                        playfully pulled at his coat-collar, and blew her sweet, warm breath into
                        his face. Lars was a simple-hearted boy, in spite of his age, and quite a
                        child at heart. He had lived so secluded from all society, and <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0277" n="238"/>
                        breathed so long the atmosphere of fairy tales, that he could see nothing at
                        all absurd in what he was about to undertake. The youngest son in the
                        story-book always did just that sort of thing, and everybody praised and
                        admired him for it. Lars meant, for once, to put the story-book hero into
                        the shade. He engaged little Marit to watch over Stella while he was gone,
                        and under no circumstances to betray him&mdash;all of which Marit
                        solemnly promised. </p>
                    <p>With his rifle on his shoulder and his <hi rend="italic">skees</hi> on his
                        feet, Lars glided slowly along over the glittering surface of the snow, for
                        the mountain was steep, and he had to zigzag in long lines before he reached
                        the upper heights, where the bear was said to have his haunts. The place
                        where Bruin had his winter den had once been pointed out to him, and he
                        remembered yet how pale his father was, when he found that he had strayed by
                        chance into so dangerous a neighborhood. Lars's heart, too, beat rather
                        uneasily as he saw the two heaps of stones, called "The Parson" and "The
                        Deacon," and the two huge fir-trees which marked the dreaded spot. It had
                        been customary from immemorial time for each person who passed along the
                        road to throw a large stone on the Parson's heap, and a small one on the
                        Deacon's; but since the Gausdale Bruin had gone into winter quarters there,
                        the stone heaps had ceased to grow. <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0278" n="239"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>Under the great knotted roots of the fir-trees there was a hole, which was
                        more than half-covered with snow; and it was noticeable that there was not a
                        track of bird or beast to be seen anywhere around it. Lars, who on the way
                        had been buoyed up by the sense of his heroism, began now to feel strangely
                        uncomfortable. It was so awfully hushed and still round about him; not the
                        scream of a bird &mdash;not even the falling of a broken bough was to be
                        heard. The pines stood in lines and in clumps, solemn, like a funeral
                        procession, shrouded in sepulchral white. Even if a crow had cawed it would
                        have been a relief to the frightened boy&mdash;for it must be confessed
                        that he was a trifle frightened&mdash;if only a little shower of snow
                        had fallen upon his head from the heavily laden branches, he would have been
                        grateful for it, for it would have broken the spell of this oppressive
                        silence. </p>
                    <p>There could be no doubt of it; inside, under those tree-roots slept Stella's
                        foe&mdash;the dreaded enchanted beast who had put the boldest of hunters
                        to flight, and set lords and baronets by the ears for the privilege of
                        possessing his skin. Lars became suddenly aware that it was a foolhardy
                        thing he had undertaken, and that he had better betake himself home. But
                        then, again, had not Witch-Martha said that she had been waiting for him;
                        that he was destined by fate to accomplish this deed, just as the youngest
                        son had been in the <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0279" n="240"/> story-book. Yes, to be sure, she had said
                        that; and it was a comforting thought. </p>
                    <p>Accordingly, having again examined his rifle, which he had carefully loaded
                        with the silver bullet before leaving home, he started boldly forward,
                        climbed up on the little hillock between the two trees, and began to pound
                        it lustily with the butt-end of his gun. He listened for a moment
                        tremulously, and heard distinctly long, heavy sighs from within. </p>
                    <p>His heart stood still. The bear was awake! Soon he would have to face it! A
                        minute more elapsed; Lars's heart shot up into his throat. He leaped down,
                        placed himself in front of the entrance to the den, and cocked his rifle.
                        Three long minutes passed. Bruin had evidently gone to sleep again. Wild
                        with excitement, the boy rushed forward and drove his skee-staff straight
                        into the den with all his might. A sullen growl was heard, like a deep and
                        menacing thunder. There could be no doubt that now the monster would take
                        him to task for his impertinence. </p>
                    <p>Again the boy seized his rifle; and his nerves, though tense as stretched
                        bow-strings, seemed suddenly calm and steady. He lifted the rifle to his
                        cheek, and resolved not to shoot until he had a clear aim at heart or brain.
                        Bruin, though Lars could hear him rummaging within, was in no hurry to come
                        out, But he sighed and growled uproariously, <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0280" n="241"/> and presently
                        showed a terrible, long-clawed paw, which he thrust out through his door and
                        then again withdrew. But apparently it took him a long while to get his mind
                        clear as to the cause of the disturbance; for fully five minutes had elapsed
                        when suddenly a big tuft of moss was tossed out upon the snow, followed by a
                        cloud of dust and an angry creaking of the tree-roots. </p>
                    <p>Great masses of snow were shaken from the swaying tops of the firs, and fell
                        with light thuds upon the ground. In the face of this unexpected shower,
                        which entirely hid the entrance to the den, Lars was obliged to fall back a
                        dozen paces; but, as the glittering drizzle cleared away, he saw an enormous
                        brown beast standing upon its hind legs, with widely distended jaws. He was
                        conscious of no fear, but of a curious numbness in his limbs, and strange
                        noises, as of warning shouts and cries, filling his ears. Fortunately, the
                        great glare of the sun-smitten snow dazzled Bruin; he advanced slowly,
                        roaring savagely, but staring rather blindly before him out of his small,
                        evil-looking eyes. Suddenly, when he was but a few yards distant, he raised
                        his great paw, as if to rub away the cobwebs that obscured his sight. It was
                        the moment for which the boy had waited. Now he had a clear aim! Quickly he
                        pulled the trigger; the shot reverberated from mountain to mountain, and in
                        the same instant the huge brown bulk rolled in the <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002438_0281" n="242"/> snow, gave
                        a gasp, and was dead! The spell was broken! The silver bullet had pierced
                        his heart. There was a curious unreality about the whole thing to Lars. He
                        scarcely knew whether he was really himself or the hero of the fairy-tale.
                        All that was left for him to do now was to go home and marry Stella, the
                        delivered princess. </p>
                    <p>The noises about him seemed to come nearer and nearer; and now they sounded
                        like human voices. He looked about him, and to his amazement saw his father
                        and Marit, followed by two wood-cutters, who, with raised axes, were running
                        toward him. Then he did not know exactly what happened; but he felt himself
                        lifted up by two strong arms, and tears fell hot and fast upon his face. </p>
                    <p>"My boy! my boy!" said the voice in his ears, "I expected to find you dead." </p>
                    <p>"No, but the bear is dead," said Lars, innocently. </p>
                    <p>"I didn't mean to tell on you, Lars," cried Marit, "but I was so afraid, and
                        then I had to." </p>
                    <p>The rumor soon filled the whole valley that the great Gausdale Bruin was
                        dead, and that the boy Lars Tomlevold had killed him. It is needless to say
                        that Lars Tomlevold became the parish hero from that day. He did not dare to
                        confess in the presence of all this praise and wonder that at heart he was
                        bitterly disappointed; for when he came home, throbbing with wild
                        expectancy, there stood <pb entity="DSSR_000002438_0282" n="243"/> Stella before the kitchen door,
                        munching a piece of bread; and when she hailed him with a low whinny, he
                        burst into tears. But he dared not tell any one why he was weeping. </p>
                    <p>This story might have ended here, but it has a little sequel. The $1,750
                        which Bruin had to his credit in the bank had increased to $2,290; and it
                        was all paid to Lars. A few years later, Martin Janson, who had inherited
                        the estate of Moe from old Lars, failed in consequence of his daring forest
                        speculations, and young Lars was enabled to buy the farm at auction at less
                        than half its value. Thus he had the happiness to bring his mother back to
                        the place of her birth, of which she had been wrongfully deprived; and
                        Stella, who was now twenty-one years old, occupied once more her handsome
                        box-stall, as in the days of her glory. And although she never proved to be
                        a princess, she was treated as if she were one, during the few years that
                        remained to her.</p>
