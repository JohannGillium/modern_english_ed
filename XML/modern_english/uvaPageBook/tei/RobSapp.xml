<head>Sappho and Phaon &mdash; Preface.</head>    
<p>IT must strike every admirer of poetical compositions, that the modern sonnet,   
concluding with two lines, winding up the sentiment of the whole, confines the   
poet's fancy, and frequently occasions an abrupt termination of a beautiful and   
interesting picture; and that the ancient, or what is generally denominated, the   
LEGITIMATE SONNET, may be carried on in a series of sketches, composing, in   
parts, one historical or imaginary subject, and forming in the whole a complete and   
connected story.</p>   
 
<p>With this idea, I have ventured to compose the following collection; not   
presuming to offer them as 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0021" n="6"/>
imitations of PETRARCH, but as specimens of that   
species of sonnet writing, so seldom attempted in the English language; though   
adopted by that sublime Bard, whose Muse produced the grand epic of Paradise   
Lost, and the humbler effusion, which I produce as an example of the measure to   
which I allude, and which is termed by the most classical writers, the legitimate   
sonnet.</p>   
   
<lg type="poem">   
 
<l>O Nightingale, that on yon bloomy spray</l>   
<l>  Warblest at eve, when all the woods are still,</l>   
<l>  Thou with fresh hope the lover's heart dost fill,</l>   
<l>While the jolly hours lead on propitious May.</l>   
<l>Thy liquid notes that close the eye of day</l>   
<l>  First heard before the shallow cuccoo's bill,</l>   
<l>  Portend succes in love; O if Jove's will</l>   
<l>Have link'd that amorous power to thy soft lay,</l>   
<l>  Now timely sing, ere the rude bird of hate</l>   
<l>Foretel my hopeless doom in some grove nigh,</l>

<p>To enumerate the variety of authors who have written sonnets of all descriptions,   
would be endless; indeed few of them deserve notice: and where, among the   
heterogeneous mass of insipid and laboured efforts, sometimes a bright gem sheds   
lustre on the page of poesy, it scarcely excites attention, owing to the disrepute in   
which sonnets are fallen. So little is rule attended to by many, who profess the art   
of poetry, that I have seen a composition of more than thirty lines, ushered into the   
world under the name of Sonnet, and that, from the pen of a writer, whose classical   
taste ought to have avoided such a misnomer.</p>   
<p>Doctor Johnson describes a Sonnet, as "a short poem, consisting of fourteen lines,   
of which the rhymes are adjusted by a particular rule." He further adds, "It has not   
been used by any man of eminence since MILTON." 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0023" n="8"/>
Sensible of the extreme difficulty I   
shall have to encounter, in offering to the world a little wreath, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0024" n="9"/>
gathered in that   
path, which, even the best poets have thought it dangerous to tread; and knowing that   
the English language is, of all others, the least congenial to such an undertaking,   
(for, I believe, that the construction of this kind of sonnet was originally in the   
Italian, where the vowels are used almost every other letter,) I only point out the   
track where more able pens may follow with success; and where the most classical   
beauties may be adopted, and drawn forth with peculiar advantage.</p>   
<p>Sophisticated sonnets are so common, for every rhapsody of rhyme, from six   
lines to sixty comes under that denomination, that the eye frequently turns from this   
species of poem with disgust. Every school-boy, every romantic scribbler, thinks a   
sonnet a task of little difficulty. From this ignorance 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0025" n="10"/>
in some, and vanity in others,   
we see the monthly and diurnal publications abounding with ballads, odes, elegies,   
epitaphs, and allegories, the non-descript ephemera from the heated brains of   
self-important poetasters, all ushered into notice under the appellation of SONNET!</p>   
<p>I confess myself such an enthusiastic votary of the Muse, that any innovation   
which seems to threaten even the least of her established rights, makes me tremble,   
lest that chaos of dissipated pursuits which has too long been growing like an   
overwhelming shadow, and menacing the lustre of intellectual light, should, aided   
by the idleness of some, and the profligacy of others, at last obscure the finer   
mental powers, and reduce the dignity of talents to the lowest degradation.</p>   
<p>As poetry has the power to raise, so has it also the magic to refine. The ancients   
considered the 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0026" n="11"/>
art of such importance, that before they led forth their heroes to the   
most glorious enterprizes, they animated them by the recital of grand and   
harmonious compositions. The wisest scrupled not to reverence the invocations of   
minds, graced with the charm of numbers: so mystically fraught are powers said to   
be, which look beyond the surface of events, that an admired and classical writer,   
describing the inspirations of the MUSE, thus expresses his opinion:</p>   
   
<lg type="poem">   
<l> "So when remote futurity is brought</l>   
<l> Before the keen inquiry of her thought,</l>   
<l> A terrible sagacity informs</l>   
<l> The Poet's heart, he looks to distant storms, </l>   
<l> He hears the thunder ere the tempest low'rs,</l>   
<l> And, arm'd with strength surpassing human pow'rs,</l>   
<l> Seizes events as yet unknown to man,</l>   
<l> And darts his soul into the dawning plan.</l>   
<l> Hence in a Roman mouth the graceful name</l>   
<l> Of Prophet and of Poet was the same,</l>   
<l> Hence British poets too the priesthood shar'd,</l>   
<l> And ev'ry hallow'd druid&mdash;was a bard."</l>   
</lg>   
    
    
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0027" n="12"/>
<p>That poetry ought to be cherished as a national ornament, cannot be more strongly   
exemplified than in the simple fact, that, in those centuries when the poets' laurels   
have been most generously fostered in Britain, the minds and manners of the   
natives have been most polished and enlightened. Even the language of a country   
refines into purity by the elegance of numbers: the strains of WALLER have done   
more to effect that, then all the labours of monkish pedantry, since the days of   
druidical mystery and superstition.</p>   
<p>Though different minds are variously affected by the infinite diversity of   
harmonious effusions, there are, I believe, very few that are wholly insensible to the   
powers of poetic compositions. Cold must that bosom be, which can resist the   
magical versification of Eloisa to Abelard; and torpid to all the more exalted   
sensations of the soul is that being, whose ear is not delighted by the
<pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0028" n="13"/>
grand and   
sublime effusions of the divine Milton! The romantic chivalry of Spencer vivifies   
the imagination; while the plaintive sweetness of Collins soothes and penetrates the   
heart. How much would Britain have been defecit in a comparison with other   
countries on the scale of intellectual grace, had these poets never existed! yet it is a   
melancholy truth, that here, where the attributes of genius have been diffused by   
the liberal hand of nature, almost to prodigality, there has not been, during a long   
series of years, the smallest mark of public distinction bestowed on literary talents.   
Many individuals, whose works are held in the highest estimation, now that their   
ashes sleep in the sepulchre, were, when living, suffered to languish, and even to   
perish, in obscure poverty: as if it were the peculiar fate of genius, to be neglected   
while existing, and only honoured when the consciousness of inspiration is   
vanished for ever.</p>   
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0029" n="14"/>
<p>The ingenious mechanic has the gratification of seeing his labours patronized,   
and is rewarded for his invention while he has the powers of enjoying its produce.    
But the Poet's life is one perpetual scene of warfare: he is assailed by envy, stung   
by malice, and wounded by the fastidious comments of concealed assassins. The   
more eminently beautiful his compositions are, the larger is the phalanx he has to   
encounter; for the enemies of genius are multitudinous.</p>   
<p>It is the interest of the ignorant and powerful, to suppress the effusions of   
enlightened minds: when only monks could write, and nobles read, authority rose   
triumphant over fright; and the slave, spell-bound in ignorance, hugged his fetters   
without repining. It was then that the best powers of reason lay buried like the   
gem in the dark mine; by a slow and tedious progress they have been drawn forth,   
and must, ere long, diffuse an universal
<pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0030" n="15"/>
lustre: for that era is rapidly advancing,   
when talents will tower like an unperishable column, while the globe will be    
strewed with the wrecks of superstition.</p>   
<p>As it was the opinion of the ancients, that poets possessed the powers of   
prophecy, the name was consequently held in the most unbounded veneration. In   
less remote periods the bard has been publicly distinguished; princes and priests   
have bowed before the majesty of genius: Petrarch was crowned with laurels, the   
noblest diadem, in the Capitol of Rome: his admirers were liberal, his    
contemporaries were just; and his name will stand upon record, with the united and   
honourable testimony of his own talents, and the generosity of his country.</p>   
<p>It is at once a melancholy truth, and a national disgrace, that this Island, so   
profusely favored by
<pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0031" n="16"/>
nature, should be marked, of all enlightened countries, as the    
most neglectful of literary merit! and I will venture to believe, that there are both   
POETS and PHILOSOPHERS, now living in Britain, who, had they been born in   
any other clime, would have been honoured with the proudest distinctions, and   
immortalized to the latest posterity.</p>   
<p>I cannot conclude these opinions without paying tribute to the talents of my   
illustrious country-women; who, unpatronized by the courts, and unprotected by   
the powerful, persevere in the paths of literature, and ennoble themselves by the   
unperishable lustre of MENTAL PRE-EMINENCE!</p>

<head>TO THE READER.</head>   
<p>The story of the <hi rend="italic">LESBIAN MUSE</hi>, though not new to the classical    
reader, presented to my imagination such a lively example of the human mind,   
enlightened by the most exquisite talents, yet yielding to the destructive controul of   
ungovernable passions, that I felt an irresistible impulse to attempt the delineation   
of their progress; mingling with the glowing picture of her soul, such moral   
reflections, as may serve to exite that pity, which, while it proves the susceptibility   
of the heart, arms it against the danger of indulging too luxuriant fancy.</p>   
<p>The unfortunate lovers, Heloise and Abelard; and, the supposed platonic,   
Petrarch and Laura, have 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0033" n="18"/>
found panegyrists in many distinguished authors.    
<hi rend="italic">OVID</hi> and <hi rend="italic">POPE</hi> have celebrated the passion of Sappho for   
Phaon; but their portraits, however beautifully finished, are replete with shades,    
tending rather to depreciate than to adorn the Grecian Poetess.</p>   
<p>I have endeavoured to collect, in the succeeding pages, the mostliberal accounts   
of that illustrious woman, whose fame has transmitted to us some fragments of her   
works, through many dark ages, and for the space of more than two thousand   
years.  The merit of her compositions must have been indisputable, to have left all   
cotemporary female writers in obscurity; for it is known, that poetry was, at the   
period in which she lived, held in the most sacred veneration; and that those who   
were gifted with that divine inspiration, were ranked as the first class of human   
beings.</p>   
<p>Among the many Grecian writers, Sappho was the unrivalled poetess of her time:   
the envy she excited, 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0034" n="19"/>
the public honours she received, and the fatal passion which    
terminated her existence, will, I trust, create that sympathy in the mind of the   
susceptible reader, which may render the following poetical trifles not wholly   
uninteresting.</p>

<head><hi rend="italic">ACCOUNT</hi> OF SAPPHO.</head>   
<p>SAPPHO, whom the ancients distinguished by the title of the TENTH MUSE,   
was born at Mytilene in the island of Lesbos, six hundred years before the   
Christian era. As no particulars have been transmitted to posterity, respecting the   
origin of her family, it is most likely she derived by little consequence from birth   
of connection. At an early period of her life she was wedded to Cercolus, a native   
of the isle of Andros; he was possessed of considerable wealth, and though the   
Lesbian Muse is said to have been sparingly gifted with
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0037" n="22"/>
beauty, he became   
enamoured of her, more perhaps on account of mental, than personal charms. By   
this union she is said to have given birth to a daughter; but Cercolus leaving her,   
while young, in a state of widowhood, she never after could be prevailed on to    
marry.</p>   
<p>The Fame which her genius spread even to the remotest parts of the earth,   
excited the envy of some writers who endeavoured to throw over her private   
character, a shade, which shrunk before the brilliancy of her poetical talents. Her   
soul was replete with harmony, that harmony which neither art nor study can   
acquire; she felt the intuitive superiority, and to the Muses she paid unbounded   
adoration.</p>   
<p>The Mytilenians held her poetry in such high veneration, and were so sensible of   
the hour conferred on the country which gave her birth, that
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0038" n="23"/>
they coined money   
with the impression of her head; and at the    
time of her death, paid tribute to their memory, such as was offered to sovereigns   
only.</p>   
<p>The story of Antiochus has been related as an unequivocal proof of Sappho's   
skill in discovering, and powers of describing the passions of the human mind.    
That prince is said to have entertained a fatal affection for his mother-in-law   
Stratonice; which, though he endeavoured to subdue it's influence, preyed upon   
his frame, and after many ineffectual struggles, at length reduced him to extreme   
danger. His physicians marked the symptoms attending his malady, and found   
them so exactly correspond with Sappho's delineation of the tender passion, that    
they did not hesitate to form a decisive opinion of the cause, which had produced   
so perilous an effect.</p>   
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0039" n="24"/>
<p>That Sappho was not insensible to the feelings she so well described , is evident   
in her writings but it was scarcely possible, that a mind so exquisitely tender, so   
sublimely gifted, should escape those fascinations which even apathy itself has been   
awakened to acknowledge.</p>   
<p>The scarce specimens now extant, from the pen of the Grecian Muse, have by the   
most competent judges been esteemed as the standard for the pathetic, the glowing,   
and the amatory. The ode, which has been so highly estimated, is written in a   
measure distinguished by the title of the Sapphic. POPE made it his model in his   
juvenile production, beginning&mdash;</p>   

<l>"Happy the man&mdash;whose wish and care"&mdash; </l>

<p>Addison was of opinion, that the writings of Sappho were replete with such   
fascinating beauties, and adorned with such a vivid glow of sensibility,
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0040" n="25"/>
that,   
probably, had they been preserved entire, it would have been dangerous to have   
perused them. They possessed none of the artificial decorations of a feigned   
passion; they were the genuine effusions of a supremely enlightened soul, laboring   
to subdue a fatal enchantment; and vainly opposing the conscious pride of   
illustrious fame, against the warm susceptibility of a generous bosom.</p>   
<p>Though few stanzas from the pen of the Lesbian poetess have darted through the   
shades of oblivion: yet, those that remain are so exquisitely touching and beautiful,   
that they prove beyond dispute the taste, feeling, and inspiration of the mind which   
produced them. In examining the curiosities of antiquity, we look to the perfections,   
and not the magnitude of those relics, which have been preserved amidst the wrecks   
of time: as the smallest gem that bears the fine touches of a master, surpasses the   
loftiest fabric reared by the 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0041" n="26"/>
labours of false taste, so the precious fragments of the   
immortal Sappho, will be admired, when the voluminous productions of inferior   
poets are mouldered into dust. </p>   
<p>When it is considered, that the few specimens we have of the poems of the   
Grecian Muse, have passed through three and twenty centuries, and consequently   
through the hands of innumerable translators: and when it is known that Envy   
frequently delights in the base occupation of depreciating merit which it canot   
aspire to emulate; it may be conjectured, that some passages are erroneously given   
to posterity, either by ignorance or design. Sappho, whose fame beamed round her   
with the superior effulgence which her works had created, knew that she was   
writing for future ages; it is not therefore natural that she should produce any   
composition which might tend to tarnish her reputation, or lessen that celebrity  
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0042" n="27"/>

which it was the labour of her life to consecrate. The delicacy of her sentiments   
cannot find a more eloquent advocate than in her own effusions; she is said to have   
commended in the most animated panegyric, the virtues of her brother Lanychus;   
and with the most pointed and severe censure, to have contemned the passion   
which her prother Charaxus entertained for the beautiful Rhodope. If her writings   
were, in some instances, too glowing for the fastidious refinement of modern times;   
let it be her excuse, and the honour of her country, that the liberal education of the   
Greeks was such, as inspired them with an unprejudiced   
enthusiasm for the works of genius: and that when they paid adoration to Sappho,   
they idolized the MUSE, and not the WOMAN. </p>   
<p>I shall conclude this account with an extract from the works of the learned and   
enlightened Abbe' Barthelemi; at once the vindication and eulogy of the Grecian   
Poetess.</p>   
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0043" n="28"/>
<p>"Sappho undertook to inspire the Lesbian women with a taste for literature; many   
of them received instructions from her, and foreign women increased the number of   
her disciples. She loved them to excess, because it was impossible for her to love   
otherwise; and she expressed her tenderness in all the violence of passion: your   
surprize at this will cease, when you are acquainted with the extreme sensibility of   
the Greeks; and discover, that amongst them the most innocent connections often   
borrow the impassioned language of love.</p>   
<p>"A certain facility of manners, she possessed; and the warmth of her expressions   
were but too well calculated to expose her to the hatred of some women of   
distinction, humbled by her superiority; and the jealousy of some of her disciples,   
who happened to be the objects of her preference. To this hatred she replied
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0044" n="29"/>
by   
truths and irony, which completely exasperated her enemies. She repaired to Sicily,   
where a statue was erected to her; it was sculptured by SILANION, one of the most   
celebrated staturists of his time. The sensibility of SAPPHO was extreme! she   
loved PHAON, who forsook her; after various efforts to bring him back, she took   
the leap of <hi rend="bold">Leucata</hi>, and perished in the waves!</p>   
<p>"Death has not obliterated the stain imprinted on her character; for ENVY,   
which fastens on ILLUSTRIOUS NAMES, does not expire; but
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002600_0045" n="30"/>
bequeaths her   
aspersions to that calumny which NEVER DIES.</p>   
<p>"Several Grecian women have cultivated POETRY, with success, but none have   
hitherto attained to the excellence of SAPPHO. And among other poets, there are   
few, indeed, who have surpassed her."</p>
