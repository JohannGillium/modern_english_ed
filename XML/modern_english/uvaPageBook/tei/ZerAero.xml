<head type="main">EVERY BOY'S MECHANICAL LIBRARY<lb/>  
By J. S. ZERBE, M. E.<lb/>  
Price, per volume, 60 cents, Net. Postage extra.</head>  
  
<head type="sub">AUTOMOBILES</head>
<p>  
This is a subject in which every boy is interested. While few  
mechanics have the opportunity to actually build an automobile,  
it is the knowledge which he must acquire about every particular  
device used, that enables him to repair and put such machines in  
order. The aim of this book is to make the boy acquainted with  
each element, so that he may understand why it is made in that  
special way, and what the advantages and disadvantages are of  
the different types. To that end each structure is shown in  
detail as much as possible, and the parts separated so as to  
give a clear insight of the different functions, all of which are  
explained by original drawings specially prepared to aid the reader.</p>  
  
<p>MOTORS<lb/>  
To the boy who wants to know the theory and the practical  
working of the different kinds of motors, told in language which  
he can understand, and illustrated with clear and explicit drawings,  
this volume will be appreciated. It sets forth the groundwork  
on which power is based, and includes steam generators, and  
engines, as well as wind and water motors, and thoroughly describes  
the Internal Combustion Engine. It has special chapters  
on Carbureters, Ignition, and Electrical systems used, and particularly  
points out the parts and fittings required with all devices  
needed in enginry. It explains the value of compounding,  
condensing, pre-heating and expansion, together with the methods  
used to calculate and transmit power. Numerous original  
illustrations.</p>  
  
<p>AEROPLANES<lb/>  
This work Is not intended to set forth the exploits of aviators  
nor to give a history of the Art. It is a book of instructions intended  
to point out the theories of flying, as given by the pioneers,  
the practical application of power to the various flying structures;  
how they are built, the different methods of controlling them;  
the advantages and disadvantages of the types now in use; and  
suggestions as to the directions in which improvements are required.  
It distinctly points out wherein mechanical flight differs  
from bird flight, and what are the relations of shape, form, size  
and weight. It treats of kites, gliders and model aeroplanes,  
and has an Interesting chapter on the aeroplane and its uses In  
the great war. All the illustrations have been specially prepared  
for the work.</p>

<head>INTRODUCTORY</head>  
  
<p>In preparing this volume on Flying Machines  
the aim has been to present the subject in such a  
manner as will appeal to boys, or beginners, in  
this field of human activity.  
  
</p><p>The art of aviation is in a most primitive state.  
So many curious theories have been brought out  
that, while they furnish food for thought, do not,  
in any way, advance or improve the structure of  
the machine itself, nor are they of any service  
in teaching the novice how to fly.  
  
</p><p>The author considers it of far more importance  
to teach right principles, and correct reasoning  
than to furnish complete diagrams of the details  
of a machine. The former teach the art, whereas  
the latter merely point out the mechanical  
arrangements, independently of the reasons for  
making the structures in that particular way.  
  
</p><p>Relating the history of an art, while it may be  
interesting reading, does not even lay the foundations  
of a knowledge of the subject, hence that  
field has been left to others.  
  
</p><p>The boy is naturally inquisitive, and he is interested  
in knowing <hi rend="italic">why</hi> certain things are necessary,  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0025" n="2"/>    
  
and the reasons for making structures in  
particular ways. That is the void into which  
these pages are placed.  
  
</p><p>The author knows from practical experience,  
while experimenting with and building aeroplanes,  
how eagerly every boy inquires into details.  
They want the reasons for things.  
  
</p><p>One such instance is related to evidence this  
spirit of inquiry. Some boys were discussing the  
curved plane structure. One of them ventured  
the opinion that birds' wings were concaved on the  
lower side. "But," retorted another, "why are  
birds' wings hollowed?"  
  
</p><p>This was going back to first principles at one  
leap. It was not satisfying enough to know that  
man was copying nature. It was more important  
to know why nature originated that type of formation,  
because, it is obvious, that if such structures  
are universal in the kingdom of flying creatures,  
there must be some underlying principle  
which accounted for it.  
  
</p><p>It is not the aim of the book to teach the art  
of flying, but rather to show <hi rend="italic">how</hi> and   
<hi rend="italic">why</hi> the  
present machines fly. The making and the using  
are separate and independent functions, and of  
the two the more important is the knowledge how  
to make a correct machine.  
  
</p><p>Hundreds of workmen may contribute to the  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0026" n="3"/>    
  
building of a locomotive, but one man, not a  
builder, knows better how to handle it. To  
manipulate a flying machine is more difficult to  
navigate than such a ponderous machine, because  
it requires peculiar talents, and the building is  
still more important and complicated, and requires  
the exercise of a kind of skill not necessary  
in the locomotive.  
  
</p><p>The art is still very young; so much is done  
which arises from speculation and theories; too  
much dependence is placed on the aviator; the  
desire in the present condition of the art is to exploit  
the man and not the machine; dare-devil exhibitions  
seem to be more important than perfecting  
the mechanism; and such useless attempts as  
flying upside down, looping the loop, and characteristic  
displays of that kind, are of no value to  
the art.</p>

<lb/>  
CHAPTER I<lb/>  
THEORIES AND FACTS ABOUT FLYING</head>  
  
<p>THE "SCIENCE" OF AVIATION.&mdash;It may be  
doubted whether there is such a thing as a "science  
of aviation." Since Langley, on May 6,  
1896, flew a motor-propelled tandem monoplane  
for a minute and an half, without a pilot, and the  
Wright Brothers in 1903 succeeded in flying a  
bi-plane with a pilot aboard, the universal opinion  
has been, that flying machines, to be successful,  
must follow the structural form of birds, and  
that shape has everything to do with flying.  
  
</p><p>We may be able to learn something by carefully  
examining the different views presented by  
those interested in the art, and then see how they  
conform to the facts as brought out by the actual  
experiments.  
  
</p><p>MACHINE TYPES.&mdash;There is really but one type  
of plane machine. While technically two forms  
are known, namely, the monoplane and the biplane,  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0029"  n="6"/>    
they are both dependent on outstretched  
wings, longer transversely than fore and aft, so  
far as the supporting surfaces are concerned, and  
with the main weight high in the structure, thus,  
in every particular, conforming to the form  
pointed out by nature as the apparently correct  
type of a flying structure.  
  
</p><p>SHAPE OR FORM NOT ESSENTIAL.&mdash;It may be  
stated with perfect confidence, that shape or form  
has nothing to do with the mere act of flying. It  
is simply a question of power. This is a broad  
assertion, and its meaning may be better understood  
by examining the question of flight in a  
broad sense.  
  
</p><p>A STONE AS A FLYING MACHINE.&mdash;When a stone  
is propelled through space, shape is of no importance.  
If it has rough and jagged sides its speed  
or its distance may be limited, as compared with  
a perfectly rounded form. It may be made in  
such a shape as will offer less resistance to the air  
in flight, but its actual propulsion through space  
does not depend on how it is made, but on the  
power which propelled it, and such a missile is a  
true heavier-than-air machine.  
  
</p><p>A flying object of this kind may be so constructed  
that it will go a greater distance, or require  
less power, or maintain itself in space at  
less speed; but it is a flying machine, nevertheless,  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0030"  n="7"/>    
in the sense that it moves horizontally through the  
air.  
  
</p><p>POWER THE GREAT ELEMENT.&mdash;Now, let us examine  
the question of this power which is able to  
set gravity at naught. The quality called <hi rend="italic">energy</hi>  
resides in material itself. It is something within  
matter, and does not come from without. The  
power derived from the explosion of a charge of  
powder comes from within the substance; and so  
with falling water, or the expansive force of  
steam.  
  
</p><p>GRAVITY AS POWER.&mdash;Indeed, the very act of the  
ball gradually moving toward the earth, by the  
force of gravity, is an illustration of a power  
within the object itself. Long after Galileo  
firmly established the law of falling bodies it began  
to dawn on scientists that <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> is   
<hi rend="italic">force</hi>.  
After Newton established the law of gravitation  
the old idea, that power was a property of each  
body, passed away.  
  
</p><p>In its stead we now have the firmly established  
view, that power is something which must have  
at least two parts, or consist in pairs, or two elements  
acting together. Thus, a stone poised on  
a cliff, while it exerts no power which can be  
utilized, has, nevertheless, what is called   
<hi rend="italic">potential</hi>  
energy. When it is pushed from its lodging place  
  
<hi rend="italic">kinetic</hi> energy is developed. In both cases,  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0031"  n="8"/>    
gravity, acting in conjunction with the mass of  
the stone, produced power.  
  
</p><p>So in the case of gunpowder. It is the unity of  
two or more substances, that causes the expansion  
called power. The heat of the fuel converting  
water into steam, is another illustration of the  
unity of two or more elements, which are necessary  
to produce   
<hi rend="italic">energy</hi>.  
  
</p><p>MASS AN ELEMENT IN FLYING.&mdash;The boy who  
reads this will smile, as he tells us that the power  
which propelled the ball through the air came  
from the thrower and not from the ball itself.  
Let us examine this claim, which came from a real  
boy, and is another illustration how acute his mind  
is on subjects of this character.  
  
</p><p>We have two balls the same diameter, one of  
iron weighing a half pound, and the other of cotton  
weighing a half ounce. The weight of one  
is, therefore, sixteen times greater than the other.  
  
</p><p>Suppose these two balls are thrown with the  
expenditure of the same power. What will be the  
result! The iron ball will go much farther, or,  
if projected against a wall will strike a harder  
blow than the cotton ball.  
  
</p><p>MOMENTUM A FACTOR.&mdash;Each had transferred  
to it a motion. The initial speed was the same,  
and the power set up equal in the two. Why this  
difference, The answer is, that it is in the material  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0032" n="9"/>    
itself. It was the mass or density which accounted  
for the difference. It was mass multiplied  
by speed which gave it the power, called, in  
this case,   
<hi rend="italic">momentum</hi>.  
  
</p><p>The iron ball weighing eight ounces, multiplied  
by the assumed speed of 50 feet per second, equals  
400 units of work. The cotton ball, weighing &frac12;  
ounce, with the same initial speed, represents 25  
units of work. The term "unit of work" means  
a measurement, or a factor which may be used to  
measure force.  
  
</p><p>It will thus be seen that it was not the thrower  
which gave the power, but the article itself. A  
feather ball thrown under the same conditions,  
would produce a half unit of work, and the iron  
ball, therefore, produced 800 times more energy.  
  
</p><p>RESISTANCE.&mdash;Now, in the movement of any body  
through space, it meets with an enemy at every  
step, and that is air   
<hi rend="italic">resistance</hi>. This is much  
more effective against the cotton than the iron  
ball: or, it might be expressed in another way:  
The momentum, or the power, residing in the  
metal ball, is so much greater than that within the  
cotton ball that it travels farther, or strikes a  
more effective blow on impact with the wall.  
  
</p><p>HOW RESISTANCE AFFECTS THE SHAPE.&mdash;It is because  
of this counterforce, resistance, that shape  
becomes important in a flying object. The metal  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0033" n="10"/>    
ball may be flattened out into a thin disk, and now,  
when the same force is applied, to project it forwardly,  
it will go as much farther as the difference  
in the air impact against the two forms.  
  
</p><p>MASS AND RESISTANCE.&mdash;Owing to the fact that  
resistance acts with such a retarding force on an  
object of small mass, and it is difficult to set up a  
rapid motion in an object of great density, lightness  
in flying machine structures has been considered,  
in the past, the principal thing necessary.  
  
</p><p>THE EARLY TENDENCY TO ELIMINATE MOMENTUM.&mdash;Builders of flying machines, for several  
years, sought to eliminate the very thing  
which gives energy to a horizontally-movable  
body, namely, momentum.  
  
</p><p>Instead of momentum, something had to be  
substituted. This was found in so arranging the  
machine that its weight, or a portion of it, would  
be sustained in space by the very element which  
seeks to retard its flight, namely, the atmosphere.  
  
</p><p>If there should be no material substance, like  
air, then the only way in which a heavier-than-air  
machine could ever fly, would be by propelling it  
through space, like the ball was thrown, or by  
some sort of impulse or reaction mechanism on  
the air-ship itself. It could get no support from  
the atmosphere.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0034" n="11"/>    
  
</p><p>LIGHT MACHINES UNSTABLE.&mdash;Gradually the  
question of weight is solving itself. Aviators are  
beginning to realize that momentum is a wonderful  
property, and a most important element in  
flying. The safest machines are those which have  
weight. The light, willowy machines are subject  
to every caprice of the wind. They are notoriously  
unstable in flight, and are dangerous even  
in the hands of experts.  
  
</p><p>THE APPLICATION OF POWER.&mdash;The thing now to  
consider is not form, or shape, or the distribution  
of the supporting surfaces, but   
<hi rend="italic">how</hi> to apply  
the power so that it will rapidly transfer a machine  
at rest to one in motion, and thereby get  
the proper support on the atmosphere to hold it  
in flight.  
  
</p><p>THE SUPPORTING SURFACES.&mdash;This brings us to  
the consideration of one of the first great problems  
in flying machines, namely, the supporting  
surfaces,&mdash;not its form, shape or arrangement,  
(which will be taken up in their proper places), but  
the area, the dimensions, and the angle necessary  
for flight.  
  
</p><p>AREA NOT THE ESSENTIAL THING.&mdash;The history  
of flying machines, short as it is, furnishes many  
examples of one striking fact: That area has  
but little to do with sustaining an aeroplane when  
once in flight. The first Wright flyer weighed  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0035" n="12"/>    
741 pounds, had about 400 square feet of plane  
surface, and was maintained in the air with a 12  
horse power engine.  
  
</p><p>True, that machine was shot into the air by a  
catapult. Motion having once been imparted to it,  
the only thing necessary for the motor was to  
maintain the speed.  
  
</p><p>There are many instances to show that when  
once in flight, one horse power will sustain over  
100 pounds, and each square foot of supporting  
surface will maintain 90 pounds in flight.  
  
</p><p>THE LAW OF GRAVITY.&mdash;As the effort to fly  
may be considered in the light of a struggle to  
avoid the laws of nature with respect to matter,  
it may be well to consider this great force as a  
fitting prelude to the study of our subject.  
  
</p><p>Proper understanding, and use of terms is very  
desirable, so that we must not confuse them.  
Thus,   
<hi rend="italic">weight</hi> and   
<hi rend="italic">mass</hi> are not the same. Weight  
varies with the latitude, and it is different at various  
altitudes; but mass is always the same.  
  
</p><p>If projected through space, a certain mass  
would move so as to produce momentum, which  
would be equal at all places on the earth's surface,  
or at any altitude.  
  
</p><p>  
<hi rend="italic">Gravity</hi> has been called weight, and   
<hi rend="italic">weight</hi>  
gravity. The real difference is plain if gravity  
is considered as the attraction of mass for mass.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0036" n="13"/>    
Gravity is generally known and considered as a  
force which seeks to draw things to the earth.  
This is too narrow.  
  
</p><p>Gravity acts in all directions. Two balls suspended  
from strings and hung in close proximity  
to each other will mutually attract each other.  
If one has double the mass it will have twice the  
attractive power. If one is doubled and the other  
tripled, the attraction would be increased six  
times. But if the distance should be doubled the  
attraction would be reduced to one-fourth; and  
if the distance should be tripled then the pull  
would be only one-ninth.  
  
</p><p>The foregoing is the substance of the law,  
namely, that all bodies attract all other bodies  
with a force directly in proportion to their mass,  
and inversely as the square of their distance from  
one another.  
  
</p><p>To explain this we cite the following illustration:  
Two bodies, each having a mass of 4  
pounds, and one inch apart, are attracted toward  
each other, so they touch. If one has twice the  
mass of the other, the smaller will draw the larger  
only one-quarter of an inch, and the large one  
will draw the other three-quarters of an inch,  
thus confirming the law that two bodies will attract  
each other in proportion to their mass.  
  
</p><p>Suppose, now, that these balls are placed two  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0037" n="14"/>    
inches apart,&mdash;that is, twice the distance. As  
each is, we shall say, four pounds in weight, the  
square of each would be 16. This does not mean  
that there would be sixteen times the attraction,  
but, as the law says,   
<hi rend="italic">inversely</hi> as the square of  
the distance, so that at two inches there is only  
one-sixteenth the attraction as at one inch.  
  
</p><p>If the cord of one of the balls should be cut, it  
would fall to the earth, for the reason that the  
attractive force of the great mass of the earth is  
so much greater than the force of attraction in  
its companion ball.  
  
</p><p>INDESTRUCTIBILITY OF GRAVITATION.&mdash;Gravity  
cannot be produced or destroyed. It acts between  
all parts of bodies equally; the force being  
proportioned to their mass. It is not affected by  
any intervening substance; and is transmitted  
instantaneously, whatever the distance may be.  
  
</p><p>While, therefore, it is impossible to divest matter  
of this property, there are two conditions  
which neutralize its effect. The first of these is  
position. Let us take two balls, one solid and  
the other hollow, but of the same mass, or density.  
If the cavity of the one is large enough to receive  
the other, it is obvious that while gravity is still  
present the lines of attraction being equal at  
all points, and radially, there can be no pull which  
moves them together.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0038" n="15"/>    
  
</p><p>DISTANCE REDUCES GRAVITATIONAL PULL.&mdash;Or  
the balls may be such distance apart that the attractive  
force ceases. At the center of the earth  
an object would not weigh anything. A pound  
of iron and an ounce of wood, one sixteen times  
the mass of the other, would be the same,&mdash;absolutely  
without weight.  
  
</p><p>If the object should be far away in space it  
would not be influenced by the earth's gravity;  
so it will be understood that position plays an  
important part in the attraction of mass for mass.  
  
</p><p>HOW MOTION ANTAGONIZES GRAVITY.&mdash;The second  
way to neutralize gravity, is by   
<hi rend="italic">motion</hi>. A  
ball thrown upwardly, antagonizes the force of  
gravity during the period of its ascent. In like  
manner, when an object is projected horizontally,  
while its mass is still the same, its weight is less.  
  
</p><p>Motion is that which is constantly combating  
the action of gravity. A body moving in a circle  
must be acted upon by two forces, one which tends  
to draw it inwardly, and the other which seeks to  
throw it outwardly.  
  
</p><p>The former is called   
<hi rend="italic">centripetal</hi>, and the latter  
  
<hi rend="italic">centrifugal</hi> motion.   
<hi rend="italic">Gravity</hi>, therefore, represents  
centripetal, and   
<hi rend="italic">motion</hi> centrifugal force.  
  
</p><p>If the rotative speed of the earth should be retarded,  
all objects on the earth would be increased  
in weight, and if the motion should be accelerated  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0039" n="16"/>    
objects would become lighter, and if sufficient  
speed should be attained all matter would fly off  
the surface, just as dirt dies off the rim of a  
wheel at certain speeds.  
  
</p><p>A TANGENT.&mdash;When an object is thrown horizontally  
the line of flight is tangential to the earth,  
  

  
or at right angles to the force of gravity. Such  
a course in a flying machine finds less resistance  
than if it should be projected upwardly, or directly  
opposite the centripetal pull.  
  
</p><p>TANGENTIAL MOTION REPRESENTS CENTRIFUGAL  
PULL.&mdash;A tangential motion, or a horizontal  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0040" n="17"/>    
movement, seeks to move matter away from the  
center of the earth, and any force which imparts  
a horizontal motion to an object exerts a centrifugal  
pull for that reason.  
  
</p><p>In Fig. 1, let A represent the surface of the  
earth, B the starting point of the flight of an object,  
and C the line of flight. That represents a  
tangential line. For the purpose of explaining  
the phenomena of tangential flight, we will assume  
that the missile was projected with a sufficient  
force to reach the vertical point D, which  
is 4000 miles from the starting point B.  
  
</p><p>In such a case it would now be over 5500 miles  
from the center of the earth, and the centrifugal  
pull would be decreased to such an extent that the  
ball would go on and on until it came within the  
sphere of influence from some other celestial  
body.  
  
</p><p>EQUALIZING THE TWO MOTIONS.&mdash;But now let us  
assume that the line of flight is like that shown  
at E, in Fig. 2, where it travels along parallel  
with the surface of the earth. In this case the  
force of the ball equals the centripetal pull,&mdash;or,  
to put it differently, the centrifugal equals the  
gravitational pull.  
  
</p><p>The constant tendency of the ball to fly off at  
a tangent, and the equally powerful pull of  
gravity acting against each other, produce a motion  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0041" n="18"/>    
which is like that of the earth, revolving  
around the sun once every three hundred and  
sixty-five days.  
  
</p><p>It is a curious thing that neither Langley, nor  
any of the scientists, in treating of the matter of  
flight, have taken into consideration this quality  
  

  
of momentum, in their calculations of the elements  
of flight.  
  
</p><p>All have treated the subject as though the  
whole problem rested on the angle at which the  
planes were placed. At 45 degrees the lift and  
drift are assumed to be equal.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0042" n="19"/>    
  
</p><p>LIFT AND DRIFT.&mdash;The terms should be explained,  
in view of the frequent allusion which  
will be made to the terms hereinafter.   
<hi rend="italic">Lift</hi>  
is the word employed to indicate the amount  
which a plane surface will support while in flight.  
  
<hi rend="italic">Drift</hi> is the term used to indicate the resistance  
which is offered to a plane moving forwardly  
against the atmosphere.  
  

  
</p><p>In Fig. 3 the plane A is assumed to be moving  
forwardly in the direction of the arrow B. This  
indicates the resistance. The vertical arrow C  
shows the direction of lift, which is the weight  
held up by the plane.  
  
</p><p>NORMAL PRESSURE.&mdash;Now there is another term  
much used which needs explanation, and that is  
  
<hi rend="italic">normal pressure</hi>. A pressure of this kind  
against a plane is where the wind strikes it at  
right angles. This is illustrated in Fig. 4, in  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0043" n="20"/>    
which the plane is shown with the wind striking  
it squarely.  
  
</p><p>It is obvious that the wind will exert a greater  
force against a plane when at its normal. On the  
  

  
other hand, the least pressure against a plane is  
when it is in a horizontal position, because then  
the wind has no force against the surfaces, and  
the only effect on the drift is that which takes  
place when the wind strikes its forward edge.  
  

  
</p><p>HEAD RESISTANCE.&mdash;Fig. 5 shows such a plane,  
the only resistance being the thickness of the  
plane as at A. This is called   
<hi rend="italic">head resistance</hi>,  
and on this subject there has been much controversy,  
and many theories, which will be considered  
under the proper headings.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0044" n="21"/>    
  
</p><p>If a plane is placed at an angle of 45 degrees  
the lift and the drift are the same, assumedly, because,  
if we were to measure the power required  
to drive it forwardly, it would be found to equal  
the weight necessary to lift it. That is, suppose  
we should hold a plane at that angle with a heavy  
wind blowing against it, and attach two pairs of  
scales to the plane, both would show the same  
pull.  
  

  
</p><p>MEASURING LIFT AND DRIFT.&mdash;In Fig. 6, A is the  
plane, B the horizontal line which attaches the  
plane to a scale C, and D the line attaching it to  
the scale E. When the wind is of sufficient force  
to hold up the plane, the scales will show the same  
pull, neglecting, of course, the weight of the  
plane itself.  
  
</p><p>PRESSURE AT DIFFERENT ANGLES.&mdash;What every  
one wants to know, and a subject on which a  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0045" n="22"/>    
great deal of experiment and time have been expended,  
is to determine what the pressures are at  
the different angles between the horizontal, and  
laws have been formulated which enable the pressures  
to be calculated.  
  
</p><p>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFT AND DRIFT IN MOTION.&mdash;The  
first observation is directed to the differences  
that exist between the lift and drift,  
when the plane is placed at an angle of less than  
45 degrees. A machine weighing 1000 pounds  
has always the same lift. Its mass does not  
change. Remember, now, we allude to its   
<hi rend="italic">mass</hi>,  
or   
<hi rend="italic">density</hi>.  
  
</p><p>We are not now referring to   
<hi rend="italic">weight</hi>, because  
that must be taken into consideration, in the  
problem. As heretofore stated, when an object  
moves horizontally, it has less weight than when  
at rest. If it had the same weight it would not  
move forwardly, but come to rest.  
  
</p><p>When in motion, therefore, while the lift, so  
far as its mass is concerned, does not change, the  
drift does decrease, or the forward pull is less  
than when at 45 degrees, and the decrease is less  
and less until the plane assumes a horizontal position,  
where it is absolutely nil, if we do not consider  
head resistance.  
  
</p><p>TABLES OF LIFT AND DRIFT.&mdash;All tables of   
<hi rend="italic">Lift</hi>  
and   
<hi rend="italic">Drift</hi> consider only the air pressures. They  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0046" n="23"/>    
do not take into account the fact that momentum  
takes an important part in the translation of an  
object, like a flying machine.  
  
</p><p>A mass of material, weighing 1000 pounds while  
at rest, sets up an enormous energy when moving  
through the air at fifty, seventy-five, or one hundred  
miles an hour. At the latter speed the movement  
is about 160 feet per second, a motion which  
is nearly sufficient to maintain it in horizontal  
flight, independently of any plane surface.  
  
</p><p>Such being the case, why take into account only  
the angle of the plane? It is no wonder that  
aviators have not been able to make the theoretical  
considerations and the practical demonstrations  
agree.  
  
</p><p>WHY TABLES OF LIFT AND DRIFT ARE WRONG.&mdash;A little reflection will show why such tables are  
wrong. They were prepared by using a plane  
surface at rest, and forcing a blast of air against  
the plane placed at different angles; and for determining  
air pressures, this is, no doubt, correct.  
But it does not represent actual flying conditions.  
It does not show the conditions existing  
in an aeroplane while in flight.  
</p><p>To determine this, short of actual experiments  
with a machine in horizontal translation, is impossible,  
unless it is done by taking into account  
the factor due to momentum and the element attributable  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0047" n="24"/>    
to the lift of the plane itself due to its  
impact against the atmosphere.  
  
</p><p>LANGLEY'S LAW.&mdash;The law enunciated by  
Langley is, that the greater the speed the less the  
power required to propel it. Water as a propelling  
medium has over seven hundred times  
more force than air. A vessel having, for instance,  
twenty horse power, and a speed of ten  
miles per hour, would require four times that  
power to drive it through the water at double the  
speed. The power is as the   
<hi rend="italic">square of the speed</hi>.  
  
</p><p>With air the conditions are entirely different.  
The boat submergence in the water is practically  
the same, whether going ten or twenty miles an  
hour. The head resistance is the same, substantially,  
at all times in the case of the boat; with the  
flying machine the resistance of its sustaining  
surfaces decreases.  
  
</p><p>Without going into a too technical description  
of the reasoning which led to the discovery of the  
law of air pressures, let us try and understand  
it by examining the diagram, Fig. 7.  
  
</p><p>A represents a plane at an angle of 45 degrees,  
moving forwardly into the atmosphere in the  
direction of the arrows B. The measurement  
across the plane vertically, along the line B,  
which is called the   
<hi rend="italic">sine of the angle</hi>, represents  
the surface impact of air against the plane.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0048" n="25"/>    
  
</p><p>In Fig. 8 the plane is at an angle of 27 degrees,  
which makes the distance in height across the line  
C just one-half the length of the line B of Fig. 7,  

  
hence the surface impact of the air is one-half that  
of Fig. 7, and the drift is correspondingly decreased.  
  

  
</p><p>MOVING PLANES VS. WINDS.&mdash;In this way Boisset,  
Duchemin, Langley, and others, determined  
the comparative drift, and those results have been  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0049" n="26"/>    
largely relied upon by aviators, and assumed to  
be correct when applied to flying machines.  
  
</p><p>That they are not correct has been proven by  
the Wrights and others, the only explanation being  
that some errors had been made in the calculations,  
or that aviators were liable to commit errors  
in observing the true angle of the planes  
while in flight.  
  
</p><p>MOMENTUM NOT CONSIDERED.&mdash;The great factor  
of momentum has been entirely ignored, and it is  
our desire to press the important point on those  
who begin to study the question of flying machines.  
  
</p><p>THE FLIGHT OF BIRDS.&mdash;Volumes have been  
written concerning observations on the flight of  
birds. The marvel has been why do soaring birds  
maintain themselves in space without flapping  
their wings. In fact, it is a much more remarkable  
thing to contemplate why birds which depend  
on flapping wings can fly.  
  
</p><p>THE DOWNWARD BEAT.&mdash;It is argued that the  
downward beat of the wings is so much more  
rapid than the upward motion, that it gets an action  
on the air so as to force the body upwardly.  
This is disposed of by the wing motion of many  
birds, notoriously the crow, whose lazily-flapping  
wings can be readily followed by the eye, and the  
difference in movement, if any, is not perceptible.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0050" n="27"/>    
  
</p><p>THE CONCAVED WING.&mdash;It is also urged that the  
concave on the under side of the wing gives the  
quality of lift. Certain kinds of beetles, and particularly  
the common house fly, disprove that theory,  
as their wings are perfectly flat.  
  
</p><p>FEATHER STRUCTURE CONSIDERED.&mdash;Then the  
feather argument is advanced, which seeks to  
show that as each wing is made up of a plurality  
of feathers, overlapping each other, they form a  
sort of a valved surface, opening so as to permit  
air to pass through them during the period of  
their upward movement, and closing up as the  
wing descends.  
  
</p><p>It is difficult to perform this experiment with  
wings, so as to show such an individual feather  
movement. It is certain that there is nothing in  
the structure of the wing bone and the feather  
connection which points to any individual feather  
movement, and our observation is, that each  
feather is entirely too rigid to permit of such an  
opening up between them.  
  
</p><p>It is obvious that the wing is built up in that  
way for an entirely different reason. Soaring  
birds, which do not depend on the flapping motion,  
have the same overlapping feather formation.  
  
</p><p>WEBBED WINGS.&mdash;Furthermore, there are numerous  
flying creatures which do not have feathered  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0051" n="28"/>    
wings, but web-like structures, or like the  
house fly, in one continuous and unbroken  
plane.  
  
</p><p>That birds which fly with flapping wings derive  
their support from the air, is undoubtedly true,  
and that the lift produced is due, not to the form,  
or shape, or area of the wing, is also beyond question.  
The records show that every conceivable  
type of outlined structure is used by nature; the  
material and texture of the wings themselves differ  
to such a degree that there is absolutely no  
similarity; some have concaved under surfaces,  
and others have not; some fly with rapidly beating  
wings, and others with slow and measured  
movements; many of them fly with equal facility  
without flapping movements; and the proportions  
of weight to wing surface vary to such an extent  
that it is utterly impossible to use such data as a  
guide in calculating what the proper surface  
should be for a correct flying machine.  
  
</p><p>THE ANGLE OF MOVEMENT.&mdash;How, then, it may  
be asked, do they get their support? There must  
be something, in all this variety and diversity of  
form, of motion, and of characteristics, which  
supplies the true answer. The answer lies in the  
  
<hi rend="italic">angle</hi> of   
<hi rend="italic">movement</hi> of every wing motion, which  
is at the control of the bird, and if this is examined  
it will be found that it supplies the correct  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0052" n="29"/>    
answer to every type of wing which nature has  
made.  
  
</p><p>AN INITIAL IMPULSE OR MOVEMENT NECESSARY.&mdash;Let A, Fig. 9, represent the section of a bird's  
wing. All birds, whether of the soaring or the  
flapping kind, must have an initial forward movement  
in order to attain flight. This impulse is  
acquired either by running along the ground, or  
by a leap, or in dropping from a perch. Soaring  
birds cannot, by any possibility, begin flight, unless  
  

  
there is such a movement to change from a  
position of rest to one of motion.  
  
</p><p>In the diagram, therefore, the bird, in moving  
forwardly, while raising the wing upwardly, depresses  
the rear edge of the wing, as in position  
1, and when the wing beats downwardly the rear  
margin is raised, in relation to its front margin,  
as shown in position 2.  
  
</p><p>A WEDGING MOTION.&mdash;Thus the bird, by a  
wedge-like motion, gives a forwardly-propelling  
action, and as the rear margin has more or less  
flexure, its action against the air is less during its  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0053" n="30"/>    
upward beat, and this also adds to the upward lift  
of the body of the bird.  
  
</p><p>NO MYSTERY IN THE WAVE MOTION.&mdash;There is  
no mystery in the effect of such a wave-like motion,  
and it must be obvious that the humming  
bird, and like flyers, which poise at one spot, are  
  

  
able to do so because, instead of moving forwardly,  
or changing the position of its body horizontally,  
in performing the undulatory motion of  
the wing, it causes the body to rock, so that at the  
point where the wing joins the body, an elliptical  
motion is produced.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0054" n="31"/>    
  
</p><p>HOW BIRDS POISE WITH FLAPPING WINGS.&mdash;This  
is shown in Fig. 10, in which eight successive positions  
of the wing are shown, and wherein four  
of the position, namely, 1, 2, 3, and 4, represent  
the downward movement, and 6, 7, 8, and 9, the  
upward beat.  
  
</p><p>All the wing angles are such that whether the  
suspension point of each wing is moving downwardly,  
or upwardly, a support is found in some  
part of the wing.  
  
</p><p>NARROW-WINGED BIRDS.&mdash;Birds with rapid flapping  
motions have comparatively narrow wings,  
fore and aft. Those which flap slowly, and are  
not swift flyers, have correspondingly broader  
wings. The broad wing is also typical of the  
soaring birds.  
  
</p><p>But how do the latter overcome gravitation  
without exercising some sort of wing movement?  
  
</p><p>INITIAL MOVEMENT OF SOARING BIRDS.&mdash;Acute  
observations show that during the early stages  
of flight, before speed is acquired, they depend  
on the undulating movement of the wings, and  
some of them acquire the initial motion by flapping.  
When speed is finally attained it is difficult  
for the eye to note the motion of the wings.  
  
</p><p>SOARING BIRDS MOVE SWIFTLY.&mdash;Now, the first  
observation is, that soaring birds are swiftly-moving creatures. As they  
sail overhead majestically  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0055" n="32"/>    
they seem to be moving slowly. But  
distance is deceptive. The soaring bird travels  
at great speeds, and this in itself should be sufficient  
to enable us to cease wondering, when it is  
remembered that swift translation decreases  
weight, so that this factor does not, under those  
conditions, operate against flight.  
  
</p><p>MUSCULAR ENERGY EXERTED BY SOARING BIRDS.&mdash;It is not conceivable that the mere will of the  
bird would impel it forwardly, without it exerted  
some muscular energy to keep up its speed. The  
distance at which the bird performs this wonderful  
evolution is at such heights from the observer  
that the eye cannot detect a movement.  
  
</p><p>WINGS NOT MOTIONLESS.&mdash;While the wings appear  
to be absolutely motionless, it is more reasonable  
to assume that a slight sinuous movement,  
or a rocking motion is constantly kept up, which  
wedges forwardly with sufficient speed to compel  
momentum to maintain it in flight. To do so requires  
but a small amount of energy. The head  
resistance of the bird formation is reduced to a  
minimum, and at such high speeds the angle of  
incidence of the wings is very small, requiring but  
little aid to maintain it in horizontal flight.</p>

<head>CHAPTER II<lb/>  
PRINCIPLES OF AEROPLANE FLIGHT</head>  
  
<p>FROM the foregoing chapter, while it may be  
rightly inferred that power is the true secret of  
aeroplane flight, it is desirable to point out certain  
other things which must be considered.  
  
</p><p>SPEED AS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS&mdash;Every boy,  
probably, has at some time or other thrown small  
flat stones, called "skippers." He has noticed  
that if they are particularly thin, and large in  
diameter, that there is a peculiar sailing motion,  
and that they move through the air in an undulating  
or wave-like path.  
  
</p><p>Two things contribute to this motion; one is the  
size of the skipper, relative to its weight, and the  
other is its speed. If the speed is slow it will  
quickly wend its way to the earth in a gradual  
curve. This curved line is called its   
<hi rend="italic">trajectory</hi>.  
If it is not very large diametrically, in proportion  
to its weight, it will also make a gradual curve in  
descending, without "skimming" up and down  
in its flight.  
  
</p><p>SHAPE AND SPEED.&mdash;It has been observed, also,  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0057" n="34"/>    
that a round ball, or an object not flattened out,  
will make a regular curved path, whatever the  
speed may be.  
  
</p><p>It may be assumed, therefore, that the shape  
alone does not account for this sinuous motion;  
but that   
<hi rend="italic">speed</hi> is the element which accounts for  
it. Such being the case it may be well to inquire  
into the peculiar action which causes a skipper  
to dart up and down, and why the path thus  
formed grows more and more accentuated as the  
speed increases.  
  
</p><p>As will be more fully described in a later chapter,  
the impact of air against a moving body does  
not increase in proportion to its speed, but in the  
ratio of the   
<hi rend="italic">square</hi> of the speed.  
  
</p><p>WHAT SQUARE OF THE SPEED MEANS.&mdash;In mathematics  
a figure is squared when it is multiplied  
by itself. Thus, 4 X 4= 16; 5 X 5 = 25; and so  
on, so that 16 is the square of 4, and 25 the square  
of 5. It has been found that a wind moving at the  
speed of 20 miles an hour has a striking or pushing  
force of 2 pounds on every square foot of surface.  
  
</p><p>If the wind travels twice as fast, or 40 miles  
an hour, the pushing force is not 4 pounds, but  
8 pounds. If the speed is 60 miles an hour the  
pushing force increases to 18 pounds.  
  
</p><p>ACTION OF A SKIPPER.&mdash;When the skipper leaves  
the hands of the thrower it goes through the air  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0058" n="35"/>    
in such a way that its fiat surface is absolutely  
on a line with the direction in which it is projected.  
  
</p><p>At first it moves through the air solely by force  
of the power which impels it, and does not in any  
way depend on the air to hold it up. See Fig.  
1, in which A represents the line of projection,  
and B the disk in its flight.  
  

</p><p>After it has traveled a certain distance, and  
the force decreases, it begins to descend, thus describing  
the line C, Fig. 1, the disk B, in this case  
descending, without changing its position, which  
might be described by saying that it merely settles  
down to the earth without changing its plane.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0059" n="36"/>    
  
</p><p>The skipper still remains horizontal, so that as  
it moves toward the earth its flat surface, which  
is now exposed to the action of the air, meets  
with a resistance, and this changes the angle of  
the disk, so that it will not be horizontal. Instead  
it assumes the position as indicated at D,  
and this impinging effect against the air causes  
the skipper to move upwardly along the line E,  
and having reached a certain limit, as at, say E,  
it automatically again changes its angle and moves  
downwardly along the path F, and thus continues  
to undulate, more or less, dependent on the combined  
action of the power and weight, or momentum,  
until it reaches the earth.  
  
</p><p>It is, therefore, clear that the atmosphere has  
an action on a plane surface, and that the extent  
of the action, to sustain it in flight, depends on two  
things, surface and speed.  
  
</p><p>Furthermore, the greater the speed the less the  
necessity for surface, and that for gliding purposes  
speed may be sacrificed, in a large measure,  
where there is a large surface.  
  
</p><p>This very action of the skipper is utilized by  
the aviator in   
<hi rend="italic">volplaning</hi>,&mdash;that is, where the  
power of the engine is cut off, either by accident,  
or designedly, and the machine descends to the  
earth, whether in a long straight glide, or in a  
great circle.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0060" n="37"/>    
  
</p><p>As the machine nears the earth it is caused to  
change the angle of flight by the control mechanism  
so that it will dart upwardly at an angle, or downwardly,  
and thus enable the pilot to sail to another  
point beyond where he may safely land.  
This changing the course of the machine so that  
it will glide upwardly, means that the incidence  
of the planes has been changed to a positive  
angle.  
  
</p><p>ANGLE OF INCIDENCE.&mdash;In aviation this is a term  
given to the position of a plane, relative to the  
air against which it impinges. If, for instance,  
an aeroplane is moving through the air with the  
front margin of the planes higher than their rear  
margins, it is said to have the planes at a positive  
angle of incidence. If the rear margins are  
higher than the front, then the planes have a negative  
angle of incidence.  
  
</p><p>The word   
<hi rend="italic">incidence</hi> really means, a falling  
upon, or against; and it will be seen, therefore,  
that the angle of incidence means the tilt of the  
planes in relation to the air which strikes it.  
  
</p><p>Having in view, therefore, that the two qualities,  
namely, speed and surface, bear an intimate  
relation with each other, it may be understood  
wherein mechanical flight is supposed to be analogous  
to bird flight.  
  
</p><p>SPEED AND SURFACE.&mdash;Birds which poise in the  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0061" n="38"/>    
air, like the humming bird, do so because they  
beat their wings with great rapidity. Those  
which soar, as stated, can do so only by moving  
through the atmosphere rapidly, or by having a  
large wing spread relative to the weight. It will  
thus be seen that speed and surface become the  
controlling factors in flight, and that while the  
latter may be entirely eliminated from the problem,  
speed is absolutely necessary under any and  
all conditions.  
  
</p><p>By speed in this connection is not meant high  
velocity, but that a movement, produced by power  
expressed in some form, is the sole and most necessary  
requisite to movement through the air with  
all heavier-than-air machines.  
  
</p><p>If sufficient power can be applied to an aeroplane,  
surface is of no consequence; shape need  
not be considered, and any sort of contrivance  
will move through the air horizontally.  
  
</p><p>CONTROL OF THE DIRECTION OF FLIGHT.&mdash;But the  
control of such a body, when propelled through  
space by force alone, is a different matter. To  
change the machine from a straight path to a  
curved one, means that it must be acted upon by  
some external force.  
  
</p><p>We have explained that power is something  
which is inherent in the thing itself. Now, in order  
that there may be a change imparted to a  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0062" n="39"/>    
moving mass, advantage must be taken of the medium  
through which it moves,&mdash;the atmosphere.  
  
</p><p>VERTICAL CONTROL PLANES.&mdash;If vertically-arranged  
planes are provided, either fore or aft of  
the machine, or at both ends, the angles of incidence  
may be such as to cause the machine to  
turn from its straight course.  
  
</p><p>In practice, therefore, since it is difficult to supply  
sufficient power to a machine to keep it in motion  
horizontally, at all times, aeroplanes are provided  
with supporting surfaces, and this aid in  
holding it up grows less and less as its speed increases.  
  
</p><p>But, however strong the power, or great the  
speed, its control from side to side is not dependent  
on the power of the engine, or the speed  
at which it travels through the air.  
  
</p><p>Here the size of the vertical planes, and their  
angles, are the only factors to be considered, and  
these questions will be considered in their proper  
places.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III<lb/>  
THE FORM OR SHAPE OF FLYING MACHINES</head>  
  
<p>EVERY investigator, experimenter, and scientist,  
who has given the subject of flight study, proceeds  
on the theory that in order to fly man must  
copy nature, and make the machine similar to the  
type so provided.  
  
</p><p>THE THEORY OF COPYING NATURE.&mdash;If such is the  
case then it is pertinent to inquire which bird is  
the proper example to use for mechanical flight.  
We have shown that they differ so radically in  
every essential, that what would be correct in one  
thing would be entirely wrong in another.  
  
</p><p>The bi-plane is certainly not a true copy. The  
only thing in the Wright machine which in any  
way resembles the bird's wing, is the rounded end  
of the planes, and judging from other machines,  
which have square ends, this slight similarity does  
not contribute to its stability or otherwise help  
the structure.  
  
</p><p>The monoplane, which is much nearer the bird  
type, has also sounded wing ends, made not so  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0064" n="41"/>    
much for the purpose of imitating the wing of the  
bird, as for structural reasons.  
  
</p><p>HULLS OF VESSELS.&mdash;If some marine architect  
should come forward and assert that he intended  
to follow nature by making a boat with a hull of  
the shape or outline of a duck, or other swimming  
fowl, he would be laughed at, and justly so, because  
the lines of vessels which are most efficient  
are not made like those of a duck or other swimming  
creatures.  
  
</p><p>MAN DOES NOT COPY NATURE.&mdash;Look about you,  
and see how many mechanical devices follow the  
forms laid down by nature, or in what respect  
man uses the types which nature provides in devising  
the many inventions which ingenuity has  
brought forth.  
  
</p><p>PRINCIPLES ESSENTIAL, NOT FORMS.&mdash;It is essential  
that man shall follow nature's laws. He cannot  
evade the principles on which the operations  
of mechanism depend; but in doing so he has, in  
nearly every instance, departed from the   
<hi rend="italic">form</hi>  
which nature has suggested, and made the machine  
irrespective of nature's type.  
  
</p><p>Let us consider some of these striking differences  
to illustrate this fact. Originally pins were  
stuck upon a paper web by hand, and placed in  
rows, equidistant from each other. This necessitates  
the co&ouml;perative function of the fingers and  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0065" n="42"/>    
the eye. An expert pin sticker could thus assemble  
from four to five thousand pins a day.  
  
</p><p>The first mechanical pinsticker placed over  
500,000 pins a day on the web, rejecting every bent  
or headless pin, and did the work with greater  
accuracy than it was possible to do it by hand.  
There was not the suggestion of an eye, or a finger  
in the entire machine, to show that nature furnished  
the type.  
  
</p><p>NATURE NOT THE GUIDE AS TO FORMS.&mdash;Nature  
does not furnish a wheel in any of its mechanical  
expressions. If man followed nature's form  
in the building of the locomotive, it would move  
along on four legs like an elephant. Curiously  
enough, one of the first road wagons had "push  
legs,"&mdash;an instance where the mechanic tried to  
copy nature,&mdash;and failed.  
  
</p><p>THE PROPELLER TYPE.&mdash;The well known propeller  
is a type of wheel which has no prototype in  
nature. It is maintained that the tail of a fish  
in its movement suggested the propeller, but the  
latter is a long departure from it.  
  
</p><p>The Venetian rower, who stands at the stern,  
and with a long-bladed oar, fulcrumed to the  
boat's extremity, in making his graceful lateral  
oscillations, simulates the propelling motion of  
the tail in an absolutely perfect manner, but it is  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0066" n="43"/>    
not a propeller, by any means comparable to the  
kind mounted on a shaft, and revoluble.  
  
</p><p>How much more efficient are the spirally-formed  
blades of the propeller than any wing or fin movement,  
in air or sea. There is no comparison between  
the two forms in utility or value.  
  
</p><p>Again, the connecting points of the arms and  
legs with the trunk of a human body afford the  
most perfect types of universal joints which nature  
has produced. The man-made universal  
joint has a wider range of movement, possesses  
greater strength, and is more perfect mechanically.  
A universal joint is a piece of mechanism  
between two elements, which enables them to be  
turned, or moved, at any angle relative to each  
other.  
  
</p><p>But why multiply these instances. Like samples  
will be found on every hand, and in all directions,  
and man, the greatest of all of nature's  
products, while imperfect in himself, is improving  
and adapting the things he sees about him.  
  
</p><p>WHY SPECIALLY-DESIGNED FORMS IMPROVE NATURAL  
STRUCTURES.&mdash;The reason for this is, primarily,  
that the inventor must design the article  
for its special work, and in doing so makes it better  
adapted to do that particular thing. The  
hands and fingers can do a multiplicity of things,  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0067" n="44"/>    
but it cannot do any particular work with the facility  
or the degree of perfection that is possible  
with the machine made for that purpose.  
  
</p><p>The hands and fingers will bind a sheaf of  
wheat, but it cannot compete with the special machine  
made for that purpose. On the other hand  
the binder has no capacity to do anything else than  
what it was specially made for.  
  
</p><p>In applying the same sort of reasoning to the  
building of flying machines we must be led to the  
conclusion that the inventor can, and will, eventually,  
bring out a form which is as far superior to  
the form which nature has taught us to use as  
the wonderful machines we see all about us are  
superior to carry out the special work they were  
designed to do.  
  
</p><p>On land, man has shown this superiority over  
matter, and so on the sea. Singularly, the submarines,  
which go beneath the sea, are very far  
from that perfected state which have been attained  
by vessels sailing on the surface; and while  
the means of transportation on land are arriving  
at points where the developments are swift and  
remarkable, the space above the earth has not yet  
been conquered, but is going through that same  
period of development which precedes the production  
of the true form itself.  
  
</p><p>MECHANISM DEVOID OF INTELLIGENCE.&mdash;The great  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0068" n="45"/>    
error, however, in seeking to copy nature's form  
in a flying machine is, that we cannot invest the  
mechanism with that which the bird has, namely,  
a guiding intelligence to direct it instinctively, as  
the flying creature does.  
  
</p><p>A MACHINE MUST HAVE A SUBSTITUTE FOR INTELLIGENCE.&mdash;Such being the case it must be endowed  
with something which is a substitute. A  
bird is a supple, pliant organism; a machine is a  
rigid structure. One is capable of being directed  
by a mind which is a part of the thing itself; while  
the other must depend on an intelligence which is  
separate from it, and not responsive in feeling or  
movement.  
  
</p><p>For the foregoing reasons success can never  
be attained until some structural form is devised  
which will consider the flying machine independently  
of the prototypes pointed out as the correct  
things to follow. It does not, necessarily, have to  
be unlike the bird form, but we do know that the  
present structures have been made and insisted  
upon blindly, because of this wrong insistence on  
forms.  
  
</p><p>STUDY OF BIRD FLIGHT USELESS.&mdash;The study of  
the flight of birds has never been of any special  
value to the art. Volumes have been written on  
the subject. The Seventh Duke of Argyle, and  
later, Pettigrew, an Englishman, contributed a  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0069" n="46"/>    
vast amount of written matter on the subject of  
bird flight, in which it was sought to show that  
soaring birds did not exert any power in flying.  
  
</p><p>Writers and experimenters do not agree on the  
question of the propulsive power, or on the form  
or shape of the wing which is most effective, or  
in the matter of the relation of surface to weight,  
nor do they agree in any particular as to the effect  
and action of matter in the soaring principle.  
  
</p><p>Only a small percentage of flying creatures use  
motionless wings as in soaring. By far, the  
greater majority use beating wings, a method of  
translation in air which has not met with success  
in any attempts on the part of the inventor.  
  
</p><p>Nevertheless, experimenting has proceeded on  
lines which seek to recognize nature's form only,  
while avoiding the best known and most persistent  
type.  
  
</p><p>SHAPE OF SUPPORTING SURFACES.&mdash;When we examine  
the prevailing type of supporting surfaces  
we cannot fail to be impressed with one feature,  
namely, the determination to insist on a broad  
spread of plane surface, in imitation of the bird  
with outstretched wings.  
  
</p><p>THE TROUBLE ARISING FROM OUTSTRETCHED  
WINGS.&mdash;This form of construction is what brings  
all the troubles in its train. The literature on  
aviation is full of arguments on this subject, all  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0070" n="47"/>    
declaring that a wide spread is essential, because,&mdash;birds fly that way.  
  
</p><p>These assertions are made notwithstanding the  
fact that only a few years ago, in the great exhibit  
of aeroplanes in Paris, many unique forms of machines  
were shown, all of them capable of flying,  
as proven by numerous experiments, and among  
them were a half dozen types whose length fore  
and aft were much greater than transversely, and  
it was particularly noted that they had most wonderful  
stability.  
  
</p><p>DENSITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE.&mdash;Experts declare  
that the density of the atmosphere varies throughout,&mdash;that it has spots here and there which are,  
apparently, like holes, so that one side or the  
other of the machine will, unaccountably, tilt, and  
sometimes the entire machine will suddenly drop  
for many feet, while in flight.  
  
</p><p>ELASTICITY OF THE AIR.&mdash;Air is the most elastic  
substance known. The particles constituting it  
are constantly in motion. When heat or cold penetrate  
the mass it does so, in a general way, so as  
to permeate the entire body, but the conductivity  
of the atmospheric gases is such that the heat  
does not reach all parts at the same time.  
  
</p><p>AIR HOLES.&mdash;The result is that varying strata  
of heat and cold seem to be superposed, and also  
distributed along the route taken by a machine,  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0071" n="48"/>    
causing air currents which vary in direction and  
intensity. When, therefore, a rapidly-moving  
machine passes through an atmosphere so disturbed,  
the surfaces of the planes strike a mass of  
air moving, we may say, first toward the plane,  
and the next instant the current is reversed, and  
the machine drops, because its support is temporarily  
gone, and the aviator experiences the sensation  
of going into a "hole."  
  
</p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACCIDENTS.&mdash;These so-called  
"holes" are responsible for many accidents. The  
outstretched wings, many of them over forty feet  
from tip to tip, offer opportunities for a tilt at one  
end or the other, which has sent so many machines  
to destruction.  
  
</p><p>The high center of gravity in all machines makes  
the weight useless to counterbalance the rising  
end or to hold up the depressed wing.  
  
</p><p>All aviators agree that these unequal areas of  
density extend over small spaces, and it is, therefore,  
obvious that a machine which is of such a  
structure that it moves through the air broadside  
on, will be more liable to meet these inequalities  
than one which is narrow and does not take in such  
a wide path.  
  
</p><p>Why, therefore, persist in making a form which,  
by its very nature, invites danger? Because birds  
fly that way!  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0072" n="49"/>    
  
</p><p>THE TURNING MOVEMENT.&mdash;This structural arrangement  
accentuates the difficulty when the machine  
turns. The air pressure against the wing  
surface is dependent on the speed. The broad  
outstretched surfaces compel the wing at the outer  
side of the circle to travel faster than the inner  
one. As a result, the outer end of the aeroplane  
is elevated.  
  
</p><p>CENTRIFUGAL ACTION.&mdash;At the same time the  
running gear, and the frame which carries it and  
supports the machine while at rest, being below  
the planes, a centrifugal force is exerted, when  
turning a circle, which tends to swing the wheels  
and frame outwardly, and thereby still further  
elevating the outer end of the plane.  
  
</p><p>THE WARPING PLANES.&mdash;The only remedy to  
meet this condition is expressed in the mechanism  
which wraps or twists the outer ends of the planes,  
as constructed in the Wright machine, or the  
ailerons, or small wings at the rear margins of the  
planes, as illustrated by the Farman machine.  
The object of this arrangement is to decrease the  
angle of incidence at the rising end, and increase  
the angle at the depressed end, and thus, by manually-operated means keep the machine on an even  
keel.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV<lb/>  
FORE AND AFT CONTROL</head>  
  
<p>THERE is no phase of the art of flying more important  
than the fore and aft control of an airship.  
Lateral stability is secondary to this feature, for  
reasons which will appear as we develop the  
subject.  
  
</p><p>THE BIRD TYPE OF FORE AND AFT CONTROL.&mdash;Every aeroplane follows the type set by nature  
in the particular that the body is caused to oscillate  
on a vertical fore and aft plane while in  
flight. The bird has one important advantage,  
however, in structure. Its wing has a flexure at  
the joint, so that its body can so oscillate independently  
of the angle of the wings.  
  
</p><p>The aeroplane has the wing firmly fixed to the  
body, hence the only way in which it is possible  
to effect a change in the angle of the wing is by  
changing the angle of the body. To be consistent  
the aeroplane should be so constructed that the  
angle of the supporting surfaces should be movable,  
and not controllable by the body.  
  
</p><p>The bird, in initiating flight from a perch, darts  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0074" n="51"/>    
downwardly, and changes the angle of the body to  
correspond with the direction of the flying start.  
When it alights the body is thrown so that its  
breast banks against the air, but in ordinary flight  
its wings only are used to change the angle of  
flight.  
  
</p><p>ANGLE AND DIRECTION OF FLIGHT.&mdash;In order to  
become familiar with terms which will be frequently  
used throughout the book, care should be  
taken to distinguish between the terms   
<hi rend="italic">angle</hi> and  
  
<hi rend="italic">direction</hi> of flight. The former has reference to  
the up and down movement of an aeroplane,  
whereas the latter is used to designate a turning  
movement to the right or to the left.  
  
</p><p>WHY SHOULD THE ANGLE OF THE BODY CHANGE?&mdash;The first question that presents itself is, why  
should the angle of the aeroplane body change?  
Why should it be made to dart up and down and  
produce a sinuous motion? Why should its nose  
tilt toward the earth, when it is descending, and  
raise the forward part of the structure while ascending?  
  
</p><p>The ready answer on the part of the bird-form  
advocate is, that nature has so designed a flying  
structure. The argument is not consistent, because  
in this respect, as in every other, it is not  
made to conform to the structure which they seek  
to copy.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0075" n="52"/>    
  
</p><p>CHANGING ANGLE OF BODY NOT SAFE.&mdash;Furthermore,  
there is not a single argument which can be  
advanced in behalf of that method of building,  
which proves it to be correct. Contrariwise, an  
analysis of the flying movement will show that it is  
the one feature which has militated against safety,  
and that machines will never be safe so long as  
the angle of the body must be depended upon to  
control the angle of flying.  
  

  
</p><p>In Fig. 11<hi rend="italic">a</hi> three positions of a monoplane are  
shown, each in horizontal flight. Let us say that  
the first figure A is going at 40 miles per hour,  
the second, B, at 50, and the third, C, at 60 miles.  
The body in A is nearly horizontal, the angle of  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0076" n="53"/>    
the plane D being such that, with the tail E also  
horizontal, an even flight is maintained.  
  
</p><p>When the speed increases to 50 miles an hour,  
the angle of incidence in the plane D must be  
decreased, so that the rear end of the frame must  
be raised, which is done by giving the tail an angle  
of incidence, otherwise, as the upper side of the  
tail should meet the air it would drive the rear  
end of the frame down, and thus defeat the attempt  
to elevate that part.  
  

</p><p>As the speed increases ten miles more, the tail  
is swung down still further and the rear end of  
the frame is now actually above the plane of flight.  
In order, now, to change the angle of flight, without  
altering the speed of the machine, the tail is  
used to effect the control.  
  
</p><p>Examine the first diagram in Fig. 12. This  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0077" n="54"/>    
shows the tail E still further depressed, and the  
air striking its lower side, causes an upward movement  
of the frame at that end, which so much decreases  
the angle of incidence that the aeroplane  
darts downwardly.  
  
</p><p>In order to ascend, the tail, as shown in the second  
diagram, is elevated so as to depress the rear  
end, and now the sustaining surface shoots upwardly.  
  
</p><p>Suppose that in either of the positions 1 or 2,  
thus described, the aviator should lose control of  
the mechanism, or it should become deranged or  
"stick," conditions which have existed in the history  
of the art, what is there to prevent an accident?  
  
</p><p>In the first case, if there is room, the machine  
will loop the loop, and in the second case the machine  
will move upwardly until it is vertical, and  
then, in all probability, as its propelling power is  
not sufficient to hold it in that position, like a  
helicopter, and having absolutely no wing supporting  
surface when in that position, it will dart  
down tail foremost.  
  
</p><p>A NON-CHANGING BODY.&mdash;We may contrast the  
foregoing instances of flight with a machine having  
the sustaining planes hinged to the body in  
such a manner as to make the disposition of its  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0078" n="55"/>    
angles synchronous with the tail. In other words,  
see how a machine acts that has the angle of flight  
controllable by both planes,&mdash;that is, the sustaining  
planes, as well as the tail.  
  

  
</p><p>In Fig. 13 let the body of the aeroplane be horizontal,  
and the sustaining planes B disposed at  
the same angle, which we will assume to be 15  
degrees, this being the imaginary angle for illustrative  
purposes, with the power of the machine  
to drive it along horizontally, as shown in position  
1.  
  
</p><p>In position 2 the angles of both planes are now  
at 10 degrees, and the speed 60 miles an hour,  
which still drives the machine forward horizontally.  
  
</p><p>In position 3 the angle is still less, being now  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0079" n="56"/>    
only 5 degrees but the speed is increased to 80  
miles per hour, but in each instance the body of  
the machine is horizontal.  
  
</p><p>Now it is obvious that in order to ascend, in  
either case, the changing of the planes to a greater  
angle would raise the machine, but at the same  
time keep the body on an even keel.  
  

  
</p><p>DESCENDING POSITIONS BY POWER CONTROL.&mdash;In  
Fig. 14 the planes are the same angles in the three  
positions respectively, as in Fig. 13, but now the  
power has been reduced, and the speeds are 30,  
25, and 20 miles per hour, in positions A, B and C.  
  
</p><p>Suppose that in either position the power should  
cease, and the control broken, so that it would be  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0080" n="57"/>    
impossible to move the planes. When the machine  
begins to lose its momentum it will descend on a  
curve shown, for instance, in Fig. 15, where position  
1 of Fig. 14 is taken as the speed and angles  
of the plane when the power ceased.  
  

  
</p><p>CUTTING OFF THE POWER.&mdash;This curve, A, may  
reach that point where momentum has ceased as  
a forwardly-propelling factor, and the machine  
now begins to travel rearwardly. (Fig. 16.) It  
has still the entire supporting surfaces of the  
planes. It cannot loop-the-loop, as in the instance  
where the planes are fixed immovably to the body.  
  
</p><p>Carefully study the foregoing arrangement, and  
it will be seen that it is more nearly in accord with  
the true flying principle as given by nature than  
the vaunted theories and practices now indulged  
in and so persistently adhered to.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0081" n="58"/>    
  
</p><p>The body of a flying machine should not be oscillated  
like a lever. The support of the aeroplane  
should never be taken from it. While it may be  
impossible to prevent a machine from coming  
down, it can be prevented from overturning, and  
this can be done without in the least detracting  
from it structurally.  
  

  
</p><p>The plan suggested has one great fault, however.  
It will be impossible with such a structure  
to cause it to fly upside down. It does not present  
any means whereby dare-devil stunts can be performed  
to edify the grandstand. In this respect  
it is not in the same class with the present types.  
  
</p><p>THE STARTING MOVEMENT.&mdash;Examine this plan  
from the position of starting, and see the advantages  
it possesses. In these illustrations we  
have used, for convenience only, the monoplane  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0082" n="59"/>    
type, and it is obvious that the same remarks apply  
to the bi-plane.  
  
</p><p>Fig. 17 shows the starting position of the stock  
monoplane, in position 1, while it is being initially  
run over the ground, preparatory to launching.  
Position 2 represents the negative angle at which  
  

  
the tail is thrown, which movement depresses the  
rear end of the frame and thus gives the supporting  
planes the proper angle to raise the machine,  
through a positive angle of incidence, of the plane.  
  
</p><p>THE SUGGESTED TYPE.&mdash;In Fig. 18 the suggested  
type is shown with the body normally in a horizontal  
position, and the planes in a neutral position,  
as represented in position 1. When sufficient  
speed had been attained both planes are  
turned to the same angle, as in position 2, and  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0083" n="60"/>    
flight is initiated without the abnormal oscillating  
motion of the body.  
  
</p><p>But now let us see what takes place the moment  
the present type is launched. If, by any error on  
the part of the aviator, he should fail to readjust  
the tail to a neutral or to a proper angle of incidence,  
after leaving the ground, the machine would  
try to perform an over-head loop.  
  

  
</p><p>The suggested plan does not require this caution.  
The machine may rise too rapidly, or its  
planes may be at too great an angle for the power  
or the speed, or the planes may be at too small an  
angle, but in either case, neglect would not turn  
the machine to a dangerous position.  
  
</p><p>These suggestions are offered to the novice, because  
they go to the very foundation of a correct  
understanding of the principles involved in the  
building and in the manipulation of flying machines,  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0084" n="61"/>    
and while they are counter to the beliefs of  
aviators, as is shown by the persistency in adhering  
to the old methods, are believed to be mechanically  
correct, and worthy of consideration.  
  
</p><p>THE LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY.&mdash;But we have still  
to examine another feature which shows the wrong  
principle in the fixed planes. The question is  
often asked, why do the builders of aeroplanes  
place most of the weight up close to the planes?  
It must be obvious to the novice that the lower  
the weight the less liability of overturning.  
  

  
</p><p>FORE AND AFT OSCILLATIONS.&mdash;The answer is,  
that when the weight is placed below the planes it  
acts like a pendulum. When the machine is traveling  
forward, and the propeller ceases its motion,  
as it usually does instantaneously, the weight, being  
below, and having a certain momentum, continues  
to move on, and the plane surface meeting  
the resistance just the same, and having no means  
to push it forward, a greater angle of resistance is  
formed.  
  
</p><p>In Fig. 19 this action of the two forces is illustrated.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0085" n="62"/>    
The plane at the speed of 30 miles is at  
an angle of 15 degrees, the body B of the machine  
being horizontal, and the weight C suspended directly  
below the supporting surfaces.  
  
</p><p>The moment the power ceases the weight continues  
moving forwardly, and it swings the forward  
end of the frame upwardly, Fig. 20, and we now  
  
  
  
have, as in the second figure, a new angle of incidence,  
which is 30 degrees, instead of 12. It will  
be understood that in order to effect a change in  
the position of the machine, the forward end ascends,  
as shown by the dotted line A.  
  
</p><p>The weight a having now ascended as far as  
possible forward in its swing, and its motion  
checked by the banking action of the plan it will  
again swing back, and again carry with it the  
frame, thus setting up an oscillation, which is extremely  
dangerous.  
  
</p><p>The tail E, with its unchanged angle, does not,  
in any degree, aid in maintaining the frame on  
an even keel. Being nearly horizontal while in  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0086" n="63"/>    
flight, if not at a negative angle, it actually assists  
the forward end of the frame to ascend.  
  
</p><p>APPLICATION OF THE NEW PRINCIPLE.&mdash;Extending  
the application of the suggested form, let us see  
wherein it will prevent this pendulous motion at  
the moment the power ceases to exert a forwardly-propelling force.  
  
</p><p>In Fig. 21 the body A is shown to be equipped  
with the supporting plane B and the tail a, so  
  

  
they are adjustable simultaneously at the same  
angle, and the weight D is placed below, similar to  
the other structure.  
  
</p><p>At every moment during the forward movement  
of this type of structure, the rear end of  
the machine has a tendency to move upwardly,  
the same as the forward end, hence, when the  
weight seeks, in this case to go on, it acts on the  
rear plane, or tail, and causes that end to raise,  
and thus by mutual action, prevents any pendulous  
swing.  
  
</p><p>LOW WEIGHT NOT NECESSARY WITH SYNCHRONOUSLY-MOVING  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0087" n="64"/>    
  
WINGS.&mdash;A little reflection will convince  
any one that if the two wings move in harmony,  
the weight does not have to be placed low,  
and thus still further aid in making a compact  
machine. By increasing the area of the tail, and  
making that a true supporting surface, instead of  
a mere idler, the weight can be moved further  
back, the distance transversely across the planes  
may be shortened, and in that way still further  
increase the lateral stability.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V<lb/>  
DIFFERENT MACHINE TYPES AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS</head>  
  
<p>THERE are three distinct types of heavier-than-air machines, which are widely separated in all  
their characteristics, so that there is scarcely a  
single feature in common.  
  
</p><p>Two of them, the   
<hi rend="italic">aeroplane</hi>, and the   
<hi rend="italic">orthopter</hi>,  
have prototypes in nature, and are distinguished  
by their respective similarities to the soaring  
birds, and those with flapping wings.  
  
</p><p>The   
<hi rend="italic">Helicopter</hi>, on the other hand, has no antecedent  
type, but is dependent for its raising  
powers on the pull of a propeller, or a plurality  
of them, constructed, as will be pointed out hereinafter.  
  
</p><p>AEROPLANES.&mdash;The only form which has met  
with any success is the aeroplane, which, in  
practice, is made in two distinct forms, one with  
a single set of supporting planes, in imitation of  
birds, and called a   
<hi rend="italic">monoplane</hi>; and the other having  
two wings, one above the other, and called  
the   
<hi rend="italic">bi-plane</hi>, or   
<hi rend="italic">two-planes</hi>.  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0089" n="66"/>    
  
</p><p>All machines now on the market which do not  
depend on wing oscillations come under those  
types.  
  
</p><p>THE MONOPLANE.&mdash;The single plane type has  
some strong claims for support. First of these  
is the comparatively small head resistance, due  
to the entire absence of vertical supporting posts,  
which latter are necessary with the biplane type.  
The bracing supports which hold the outer ends  
of the planes are composed of wires, which offer  
but little resistance, comparatively, in flight.  
  
</p><p>ITS ADVANTAGES.&mdash;Then the vertical height of  
the machine is much less than in the biplane. As  
a result the weight, which is farther below the  
supporting surface than in the biplane, aids in  
maintaining the lateral stability, particularly  
since the supporting frame is higher.  
  
</p><p>Usually, for the same wing spread, the monoplane  
is narrower, laterally, which is a further  
aid to prevent tilting.  
  
</p><p>ITS DISADVANTAGES.&mdash;But it also has disadvantages  
which must be apparent from its structure.  
As all the supporting surface is concentrated  
in half the number of planes, they must  
be made of greater width fore and aft, and this,  
as we shall see, later on, proves to be a disadvantage.  
  
</p><p>It is also doubted whether the monoplane can  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0090" n="67"/>    
be made as strong structurally as the other form,  
owing to the lack of the truss formation which is  
the strong point with the superposed frame. A  
truss is a form of construction where braces can  
be used from one member to the next, so as to  
brace and stiffen the whole.  
  
</p><p>THE BIPLANE.&mdash;Nature does not furnish a type  
of creature which has superposed wings. In this  
particular the inventor surely did not follow nature.  
The reasons which led man to employ this  
type may be summarized as follows:  
  
</p><p>In experimenting with planes it is found that  
a broad fore and aft surface will not lift as much  
as a narrow plane. This subject is fully explained  
in the chapter on <hi rend="italic">The Lifting Surfaces of  
Planes</hi>. In view of that the technical descriptions  
of the operation will not be touched upon  
at this place, except so far as it may be necessary  
to set forth the present subject.  
  
</p><p>This peculiarity is due to the accumulation of  
a mass of moving air at the rear end of the plane,  
which detracts from its lifting power. As it  
would be a point of structural weakness to make  
the wings narrow and very long, Wenham many  
years ago suggested the idea of placing one plane  
above the other, and later on Chanute, an  
engineer, used that form almost exclusively, in  
experimenting with his gliders.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0091" n="68"/>    
  
</p><p>It was due to his influence that the Wrights  
adopted that form in their gliding experiments,  
and later on constructed their successful flyers  
in that manner. Originally the monoplane was  
the type generally employed by experimenters,  
such as Lilienthal, and others.  
  
</p><p>STABILITY IN BIPLANES.&mdash;Biplanes are not naturally  
as stable laterally as the monoplane.  
The reason is, that a downward tilt has the benefit  
of only a narrow surface, comparable with the  
monoplane, which has broadness of wing.  
  
</p><p>To illustrate this, let us assume that we have  
a biplane with planes five feet from front to rear,  
and thirty-six feet in length. This would give  
two planes with a sustaining surface of 360 square  
feet. The monoplane would, probably, divide  
this area into one plane eight and a half feet from  
front to rear, and 42 feet in length.  
  
</p><p>In the monoplane each wing would project out  
about three feet more on each side, but it would  
have eight and a half feet fore and aft spread  
to the biplane's five feet, and thus act as a greater  
support.  
  
</p><p>THE ORTHOPTER.&mdash;The term orthopter, or ornithopter,  
meaning bird wing, is applied to such  
flying machines as depend on wing motion to support  
them in the air.  
  
</p><p>Unquestionably, a support can be obtained by  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0092" n="69"/>    
beating on the air but to do so it is necessary to  
adopt the principle employed by nature to secure  
an upward propulsion. As pointed out elsewhere,  
it cannot be the concaved type of wing,  
or its shape, or relative size to the weight it must  
carry.  
  
</p><p>As nature has furnished such a variety of data  
on these points, all varying to such a remarkable  
degree, we must look elsewhere to find the secret.  
Only one other direction offers any opportunity,  
and that is in the individual wing movement.  
  
</p><p>NATURE'S TYPE NOT UNIFORM.&mdash;When this is  
examined, the same obscurity surrounds the issue.  
Even the speeds vary to such an extent that when  
it is tried to differentiate them, in comparison  
with form, shape, and construction, the experimenter  
finds himself wrapt in doubt and perplexity.  
  
</p><p>But birds do fly, notwithstanding this wonderful  
array of contradictory exhibitions. Observation  
has not enabled us to learn why these things  
are so. High authorities, and men who are expert  
aviators, tell us that the bird flies because  
it is able to pick out ascending air currents.  
  
</p><p>THEORIES ABOUT FLIGHT OF BIRDS.&mdash;Then we  
are offered the theory that the bird has an instinct  
which tells it just how to balance in the  
air when its wings are once set in motion. Frequently,  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0093" n="70"/>    
what is taken for instinct, is something  
entirely different.  
  
</p><p>It has been assumed, for instance, that a cyclist  
making a turn at a rapid speed, and a bird flying  
around a circle will throw the upper part of the  
body inwardly to counteract the centrifugal force  
which tends to throw it outwardly.  
  
</p><p>Experiments with the monorail car, which is  
equipped with a gyroscope to hold it in a vertical  
position, show that when the car approaches a  
curve the car will lean inwardly, exactly the same  
as a bird, or a cyclist, and when a straight stretch  
is reached, it will again straighten up.  
  
</p><p>INSTINCT.&mdash;Now, either the car, so equipped  
possesses instinct, or there must be a principle  
in the laws of nature which produces the similarity  
of action.  
  
</p><p>In like manner there must be some principle  
that is entirely independent of the form of matter,  
or its arrangement, which enables the bird  
to perform its evolutions. We are led to believe  
from all the foregoing considerations that it is  
the manner or the   
<hi rend="italic">form of the motion</hi>.  
  
</p><p>MODE OF MOTION.&mdash;In this respect it seems to  
be comparable in every respect to the great and  
universal law of the motions in the universe.  
Thus, light, heat and electricity are the same, the  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0094" n="71"/>    
manifestations being unlike only because they  
have different   
<hi rend="italic">modes of motion</hi>.  
  
</p><p>Everything in nature manifests itself by motion.  
It is the only way in which nature acts.  
Every transformation from one thing to another,  
is by way of a movement which is characteristic  
in itself.  
  
</p><p>Why, then, should this great mystery of nature,  
act unlike the other portions of which it is  
a part?  
  
</p><p>THE WING STRUCTURE.&mdash;The wing structure of  
every flying creature that man has examined, has  
one universal point of similarity, and that is the  
manner of its connection with the body. It is a  
sort of universal joint, which permits the wing  
to swing up and down, perform a gyratory movement  
while doing so, and folds to the rear when  
at rest.  
  
</p><p>Some have these movements in a greater or  
less degree, or capable of a greater range; but  
the joint is the same, with scarcely an exception.  
When the stroke of the wing is downwardly the  
rear margin is higher than the front edge, so  
that the downward beat not only raises the body  
upwardly, but also propels it forwardly.  
  
</p><p>THE WING MOVEMENT.&mdash;The moment the wing  
starts to swing upwardly the rear end is depressed,  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0095" n="72"/>    
and now, as the bird is moving forwardly,  
the wing surface has a positive angle of  
incidence, and as the wing rises while the forward  
motion is taking place, there is no resistance  
which is effective enough to counteract the  
momentum which has been set up.  
  
</p><p>The great problem is to put this motion into a  
mechanical form. The trouble is not ascribable  
to the inability of the mechanic to describe this  
movement. It is an exceedingly simple one.  
The first difficulty is in the material that must  
be used. Lightness and strength for the wing  
itself are the first requirements. Then rigidity  
in the joint and in the main rib of the wing, are  
the next considerations.  
  
</p><p>In these respects the ability of man is limited.  
The wing ligatures of flying creatures is exceedingly  
strong, and flexible; the hollow bone formation  
and the feathers are extremely light, compared  
with their sustaining powers.  
  
</p><p>THE HELICOPTER MOTION.&mdash;The helicopter, or  
  
<hi rend="italic">helix-wing</hi>, is a form of flying machine which depends  
on revolving screws to maintain it in the  
air. Many propellers are now made, six feet in  
length, which have a pull of from 400 to 500  
pounds. If these are placed on vertically-disposed  
shafts they would exert a like power to  
raise a machine from the earth.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0096" n="73"/>    
  
</p><p>Obviously, it is difficult to equip such a machine  
with planes for sustaining it in flight, after it is  
once in the air, and unless such means are provided  
the propellers themselves must be the  
mechanism to propel it horizontally.  
  
</p><p>This means a change of direction of the shafts  
which support the propellers, and the construction  
is necessarily more complicated than if they  
were held within non-changeable bearings.  
  
</p><p>This principle, however, affords a safer means  
of navigating than the orthopter type, because  
the blades of such an instrument can be forced  
through the air with infinitely greater speed than  
beating wings, and it devolves on the inventor to  
devise some form of apparatus which will permit  
the change of pull from a vertical to a horizontal  
direction while in flight.</p>

THE LIFTING SURFACES OF AEROPLANES</head>  
  
<p>THIS subject includes the form, shape and angle  
of planes, used in flight. It is the direction in  
which most of the energy has been expended in  
developing machines, and the true form is still  
involved in doubt and uncertainty.  
  
</p><p>RELATIVE SPEED AND ANGLE.&mdash;The relative  
speed and angle, and the   
<hi rend="italic">camber</hi>, or the curved  
formation of the plane, have been considered in  
all their aspects, so that the art in this respect has  
advanced with rapid strides.  
  
</p><p>NARROW PLATES MOST EFFECTIVE.&mdash;It was  
learned, in the early stages of the development  
by practical experiments, that a narrow plane,  
fore and aft, produces a greater lift than a wide  
one, so that, assuming the plane has 100 square  
feet of sustaining surface, it is far better to make  
the shape five feet by twenty than ten by ten.  
  
</p><p>However, it must be observed, that to use the  
narrow blade effectively, it must be projected  
through the air with the long margin forwardly.  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0098" n="75"/>    
Its sustaining power per square foot of surface  
is much less if forced through the air lengthwise.  
  
</p><p>Experiments have shown why a narrow blade  
has proportionally a greater lift, and this may  
be more clearly understood by examining the  
illustrations which show the movement of planes  
through the air at appropriate angles.  
  

  
</p><p>STREAM LINES ALONG A PLANE.&mdash;In Fig. 22, A  
is a flat plane, which we will assume is 10 feet  
from the front to the rear margin. For convenience  
seven stream lines of air are shown,  
which contact with this inclined surface. The first  
line 1, after the contact at the forward end, is  
driven downwardly along the surface, so that it  
forms what we might term a moving film.  
  
</p><p>The second air stream 2, strikes the first stream,  
followed successively by the other streams, 3, 4,  
and so on, each succeeding stream being compelled  
to ride over, or along on the preceding mass of  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0099" n="76"/>    
cushioned air, the last lines, near the lower end,  
being, therefore, at such angles, and contacting  
with such a rapidly-moving column, that it produces  
but little lift in comparison with the 1st,  
2d and 3d stream lines. These stream lines are  
taken by imagining that the air approaches and  
contacts with the plane only along the lines indicated  
in the sketch, although they also in practice  
are active against every part of the plane.  
  
</p><p>THE CENTER OF PRESSURE.&mdash;In such a plane the  
  
<hi rend="italic">center of pressure</hi> is near its upper end, probably  
near the line 3, so that the greater portion of the  
lift is exerted by that part of the plane above  
line 3.  
  
</p><p>AIR LINES ON THE UPPER SIDE OF THE PLANE.&mdash;Now, another factor must be considered, namely,  
the effect produced on the upper side of the plane,  
over which a rarefied area is formed at certain  
points, and, in practice, this also produces, or  
should be utilized to effect a lift.  
  
</p><p>RAREFIED AREA.&mdash;What is called a   
<hi rend="italic">rarefied area</hi>,  
has reference to a state or condition of the atmosphere  
which has less than the normal pressure or  
quantity of air. Thus, the pressure at sea level,  
is about 14 3/4 per square inch  
  
</p><p>As we ascend the pressure grows less, and the  
air is thus rarer, or, there is less of it. This is a  
condition which is normally found in the atmosphere.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0100" n="77"/>    
Several things tend to make a rarefied  
condition. One is altitude, to which we have just  
referred.  
  
</p><p>Then heat will expand air, making it less dense,  
or lighter, so that it will move upwardly, to be  
replaced by a colder body of air. In aeronautics  
neither of these conditions is of any importance  
in considering the lifting power of aeroplane surfaces.  
  
</p><p>RAREFACTION PRODUCED BY MOTION.&mdash;The third  
rarefied condition is produced by   
<hi rend="italic">motion</hi>, and generally  
the area is very limited when brought about  
by this means. If, for instance, a plane is held  
horizontally and allowed to fall toward the earth,  
it will be retarded by two forces, namely, compression  
and rarefaction, the former acting on the  
under side of the plane, and the latter on the upper  
side.  
  
</p><p>Of the two rarefaction is the most effectual,  
and produces a greater effect than compression.  
This may be proven by compressing air in a long  
pipe, and noting the difference in gauge pressure  
between the ends, and then using a suction pump  
on the same pipe.  
  
</p><p>When a plane is forced through the air at any  
angle, a rarefied area is formed on the side which  
is opposite the one having the positive angle of  
incidence.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0101" n="78"/>    
  
</p><p>If the plane can be so formed as to make a large  
and effective area it will add greatly to the value  
of the sustaining surface.  
  
</p><p>Unfortunately, the long fiat plane does not lend  
any aid in this particular, as the stream line flows  
down along the top, as shown in Fig. 23, without  
being of any service.  
  

  
</p><p>THE CONCAVED PLANE.&mdash;These considerations  
led to the adoption of the concaved plane formation,  
and for purposes of comparison the diagram,  
Fig. 24, shows the plane B of the same length and  
angle as the straight planes.  
  
</p><p>In examining the successive stream lines it will  
be found that while the 1st, 2d and 3d lines have  
a little less angle of impact than the corresponding  
lines in the straight plane, the last lines, 5, 6  
and 7, have much greater angles, so that only line  
4 strikes the plane at the same angle.  
  
</p><p>Such a plane structure would, therefore, have  
its center of pressure somewhere between the  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0102" n="79"/>    
lines 3 and 4, and the lift being thus, practically,  
uniform over the surface, would be more effective.  
  
</p><p>THE CENTER OF PRESSURE.&mdash;This is a term used  
to indicate the place on the plane where the air  
acts with the greatest force. It has reference to  
a point between the front and rear margins only  
of the plane.  
  

  
</p><p>UTILIZING THE RAREFIED AREA.&mdash;This structure,  
however, has another important advantage, as it  
utilizes the rarefied area which is produced, and  
which may be understood by reference to Fig. 25.  
  
</p><p>The plane B, with its upward curve, and at the  
same angle as the straight plane, has its lower  
end so curved, with relation to the forward movement,  
that the air, in rushing past the upper end,  
cannot follow the curve rapidly enough to maintain  
the same density along C, hence this exerts  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0103" n="80"/>    
an upward pull, due to the rarefied area, which  
serves as a lifting force, as well as the compressed  
mass beneath the plane.  
  
</p><p>CHANGING CENTER OF PRESSURE.&mdash;The center of  
pressure is not constant. It changes with the  
angle of the plane, but the range is considerably  
less on a concave surface than on a flat plane.  
  

  
</p><p>In a plane disposed at a small angle, A, as in  
Fig. 26, the center of pressure is nearer the forward  
end of the plane than with a greater positive  
angle of incidence, as in Fig. 27, and when  
the plane is in a normal flying angle, it is at the  
center, or at a point midway between the margins.  
  
</p><p>PLANE MONSTROSITIES.&mdash;Growing out of the idea  
that the wing in nature must be faithfully copied,  
it is believed by many that a plane with a pronounced  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0104" n="81"/>    
thickness at its forward margin is one  
of the secrets of bird flight.  
  
</p><p>Accordingly certain inventors have designed  
  

  
types of wings which are shown in Figs. 28 and  
29.  
  
</p><p>Both of these types have pronounced bulges, designed  
  

  
to "split" the air, forgetting, apparently,  
that in other parts of the machine every effort is  
made to prevent head resistance.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0105" n="82"/>    
  
</p><p>THE BIRD WING STRUCTURE.&mdash;The advocates of  
such construction maintain that the forward edge  
of the plane must forcibly drive the air column  
apart, because the bird wing is so made, and that  
while it may not appear exactly logical, still there  
is something about it which seems to do the work,  
and for that reason it is largely adopted.  
  
</p><p>WHY THE BIRD'S WING HAS A PRONOUNCED  
BULGE.&mdash;Let us examine this claim. The bone  
which supports the entire wing surface, called the  
<hi rend="italic">(pectoral</hi>, has a heavy duty to perform. It is so  
constructed that it must withstand an extraordinary  
torsional strain, being located at the forward  
portion of the wing surface.   
<hi rend="italic">Torsion</hi> has  
reference to a twisting motion.  
  
</p><p>In some cases, as in the bat, this primary bone  
has an attachment to the rear of the main joint,  
where the rear margin of the wing is attached to  
the leg of the animal, thus giving it a support  
and the main bone is, therefore, relieved of this  
torsional stress.  
  
</p><p>THE BAT'S WING.&mdash;An examination of the bat's  
wing shows that the pectoral bone is very small  
and thin, thus proving that when the entire wing  
support is thrown upon the primary bone it must  
be large enough to enable it to carry out its functions.  
It is certainly not so made because it is a  
necessary shape which best adapts it for flying.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0106" n="83"/>    
  
</p><p>If such were the case then nature erred in the  
case of the bat, and it made a mistake in the  
housefly's wing which has no such anterior enlargement  
to assist (?) it in flying.  
  
</p><p>AN ABNORMAL SHAPE.&mdash;Another illustration is  
shown in Fig. 30, which has a deep concave directly  
behind the forward margin, as at A, so  
that when the plane is at an angle of about 22  
  

  
degrees, a horizontal line, as B, passing back from  
the nose, touches the incurved surface of the plane  
at a point about one-third of its measurement  
back across the plane.  
  
</p><p>This form is an exact copy of the wing of an  
actual bird, but it belongs, not to the soaring,  
but to the class which depends on flapping wings,  
and as such it cannot be understood why it should  
be used for soaring machines, as all aeroplanes  
are.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0107" n="84"/>    
  
</p><p>The foregoing instances of construction are  
cited to show how wildly the imagination will  
roam when it follows wrong ideals.  
  
</p><p>THE TAIL AS A MONITOR.&mdash;The tendency of the  
center of pressure to change necessitates a correctional  
means, which is supplied in the tail of  
the machine, just as the tail of a kite serves to  
hold it at a correct angle with respect to the wind  
and the pull of the supporting string.</p>

ABNORMAL FLYING STUNTS AND SPEEDS</head>  
  
<p>"PEQUOD, a Frenchman, yesterday repeatedly  
performed the remarkable feat of flying with the  
machine upside down. This exhibition shows  
that the age of perfection has arrived in flying  
machines, and that stability is an accomplished  
fact."&mdash;News item.  
  
  
</p><p>This is quoted to show how little the general  
public knows of the subject of aviation. It correctly  
represents the achievement of the aviator,  
and it probably voiced the sentiment of many  
scientific men, as well as of the great majority of  
aviators.  
  
</p><p>A few days afterwards, the same newspaper  
published the following:  
  
  
</p><p>"Lieutenant &mdash;, while experimenting yesterday  
morning, met his death by the overturning  
of his machine at an altitude of 300 meters.  
Death was instantaneous, and the machine was  
completely destroyed."  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0109" n="86"/>    
  
</p><p>The machines used by the two men were of the  
same manufacture, as Pequod used a stock machine  
which was strongly braced to support the  
inverted weight, but otherwise it was not unlike  
the well known type of monoplane.  
  
</p><p>Beachy has since repeated the experiment with  
a bi-plane, and it is a feat which has many imitators,  
and while those remarkable exhibitions  
are going on, one catastrophe follows the other  
with the same regularity as in the past.  
  
</p><p>Let us consider this phase of flying. Are they  
of any value, and wherein do they teach anything  
that may be utilized,  
  
</p><p>LACK OF IMPROVEMENTS IN MACHINES.&mdash;It is remarkable  
that not one single forward step has  
been taken to improve the type of flying machines  
for the past five years. They possess the same  
shape, their stabilizing qualities and mechanism  
for assuring stability are still the same.  
  
</p><p>MEN EXPEDITED, AND NOT THE MACHINE.&mdash;The  
fact is, that during this period the man has been  
exploited and not the machine. Men have learned,  
some few of them, to perform peculiar stunts,  
such as looping the loop, the side glide, the drop,  
and other features, which look, and are, hazardous,  
all of which pander to the sentiments of the spectators.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0110" n="87"/>    
  
</p><p>ABNORMAL FLYING OF NO VALUE.&mdash;It would be  
too broad an assertion to say that it has absolutely  
no value, because everything has its use  
in a certain sense, but if we are to judge from  
the progress of inventions in other directions,  
such exhibitions will not improve the art of building  
the device, or make a fool-proof machine.  
  
</p><p>Indeed, it is the very thing which serves as a  
deterrent, rather than an incentive. If machines  
can be handled in such a remarkable manner, they  
must be, indeed, perfect! Nothing more is  
needed! They must represent the highest structural  
type of mechanism!  
  
</p><p>That is the idea sought to be conveyed in the  
first paragraph quoted. It is pernicious, instead  
of praiseworthy, because it gives a false impression,  
and it is remarkable that even certain scientific  
journals have gravely discussed the perfected  
(?) type of flying machine as demonstrated  
by the experiments alluded to.  
  
</p><p>THE ART OF JUGGLING.&mdash;We may, occasionally,  
see a cyclist who understands the art of balancing  
so well that he can, with ease, ride a machine  
which has only a single wheel; or he can, with a  
stock bicycle, ride it in every conceivable attitude,  
and make it perform all sorts of feats.  
  
</p><p>It merely shows that man has become an expert  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0111" n="88"/>    
at juggling with a machine, the same as he  
manipulates balls, and wheels, and other artifices,  
by his dexterity.  
  
</p><p>PRACTICAL USES THE BEST TEST.&mdash;The bicycle  
did not require such displays to bring it to perfection.  
It has been the history of every invention  
that improvements were brought about, not  
by abnormal experiments, but by practical uses  
and by normal developments.  
  
</p><p>The ability of an aviator to fly with the machine  
in an inverted position is no test of the machine's  
stability, nor does it in any manner prove that  
it is correctly built. It is simply and solely a  
juggling feat&mdash;something in the capacity of a certain  
man to perform, and attract attention because  
they are out of the ordinary.  
  
</p><p>CONCAVED AND CONVEX PLANES:&mdash;They were performed  
as exhibition features, and intended as  
such, and none of the exponents of that kind of  
flying have the effrontery to claim that they prove  
anything of value in the machine itself, except  
that it incidentally has destroyed the largely  
vaunted claim that concaved wings for supporting  
surfaces are necessary.  
  
</p><p>HOW MOMENTUM IS A FACTOR IN INVERTED FLYING.&mdash;When flying "upside down," the convex  
side of the plane takes the pressure of the air,  
and maintains, so it is asserted, the weight of the  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0112" n="89"/>    
machine. This is true during that period when  
the loop is being made. The evolution is made  
by first darting down, as shown in Fig. 31, from  
the horizontal position, 1, to the position 2, where  
the turn begins.  
  

  
</p><p>TURNING MOVEMENT.&mdash;Now note the characteristic  
angles of the tail, which is the controlling  
factor. In position 1 the tail is practically  
horizontal. In fact, in all machines, at  
high flight, the tail is elevated so as to give little  
positive angle of incidence to the supporting  
planes.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0113" n="90"/>    
  
</p><p>In position No. 2, the tail is turned to an angle  
of incidence to make the downward plunge, and  
when the machine has assumed the vertical, as in  
position 3, the tail is again reversed to assume  
the angle, as in 1, when flying horizontally.  
  
</p><p>At the lower turn, position 4, the tail is turned  
similar to the angle of position 2, which throws  
the rear end of the machine down, and as the  
horizontal line of flight is resumed, in an inverted  
position, as in position 4, the tail has the same  
angle, with relation to the frame, as the supporting  
planes.  
  
</p><p>During this evolution the engine is running, and  
the downward plunge develops a tremendous  
speed, and the great momentum thus acquired,  
together with the pulling power of the propeller  
while thus in flight, is sufficient to propel it along  
horizontally, whatever the plane surface curve, or  
formation may be.  
  
</p><p>It is the momentum which sustains it in space,  
not the air pressure beneath the wings, for  
reasons which we have heretofore explained.  
Flights of sufficient duration have thus been made  
to prove that convex, as well as concave surfaces  
are efficient; nevertheless, in its proper place we  
have given an exposition of the reasoning which  
led to the adoption of the concaved supporting  
surfaces.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0114" n="91"/>    
  
</p><p>WHEN CONCAVED PLANES ARE DESIRABLE.&mdash;Unquestionably, for slow speeds the concaved wing  
is desirable, as will be explained, but for high  
speeds, surface formation has no value. That is  
shown by Pequod's feat.  
  
</p><p>THE SPEED MANIA.&mdash;This is a type of mania  
which pervades every field of activity in the building  
of aeroplanes. Speed contests are of more  
importance to the spectators on exhibition  
grounds than stability or durability. Builders  
pander to this, hence machines are built on lines  
which disregard every consideration of safety  
while at normal flight.  
  
</p><p>USES OF FLYING MACHINES.&mdash;The machine as  
now constructed is of little use commercially.  
Within certain limitations it is valuable for scouting  
purposes, and attempts have been made to  
use it commercially. But the unreliable character  
of its performances, due to the many elements  
which are necessary to its proper working, have  
operated against it.  
  
</p><p>PERFECTION IN MACHINES MUST COME BEFORE  
SPEED.&mdash;Contrary to every precept in the building  
of a new article, the attempt is made to make  
a machine with high speed, which, in the very  
nature of things, operates against its improvement.  
The opposite lack of speed&mdash;is of far  
greater utility at this stage of its development.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0115" n="92"/>    
  
</p><p>THE RANGE OF ITS USE.&mdash;The subject might be  
illustrated by assuming that we have a line running  
from A to Z, which indicates the range of  
speeds in aeroplanes. The limits of speeds are  
fairly stated as being within thirty and eighty-five miles per hour. Less than thirty miles are  
impossible with any type of plane, and while some  
have made higher speeds than eighty-five miles it  
may be safe to assume that such flights took place  
under conditions where the wind contributed to  
the movement.  
  

  
</p><p>COMMERCIAL UTILITY.&mdash;Before machines can be  
used successfully they must be able to attain  
slower speeds. Alighting is the danger factor.  
Speed machines are dangerous, not in flight or  
at high speeds, but when attempting to land. A  
large plane surface is incompatible with speed,  
which is another illustration that at high velocities  
supporting surfaces are not necessary.  
  
</p><p>Commercial uses require safety as the first element,  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0116" n="93"/>    
and reliability as the next essential. For  
passenger service there must be an assurance that  
it will not overturn, or that in landing danger is  
not ever-present. For the carrying of freight interrupted  
service will militate against it.  
  
</p><p>How few are the attempts to solve the problem  
of decreased speed, and what an eager, restless  
campaign is being waged to go faster and faster,  
and the addition of every mile above the record  
is hailed as another illustration of the perfection  
(?) of the flying machine.  
  
</p><p>To be able to navigate a machine at ten, or fifteen  
miles an hour, would scarcely be interesting  
enough to merit a paragraph; but such an accomplishment  
would be of far more value than all of  
Pequod's feats, and be more far-reaching in its  
effects than a flight of two hundred miles per hour.</p>

KITES AND GLIDERS</head>  
  
<p>KITES are of very ancient origin, and in China,  
Japan, and the Malayan Peninsula, they have been  
used for many years as toys, and for the purposes  
of exhibiting forms of men, animals, and particularly  
dragons, in their periodical displays.  
  
</p><p>THE DRAGON KITE.&mdash;The most noted of all are  
the dragon kites, many of them over a hundred  
feet in length, are adapted to sail along majestically,  
their sinuous or snake-like motions lending  
an idea of reality to their gorgeously-colored appearance  
in flight.  
  
</p><p>ITS CONSTRUCTION.&mdash;It is very curiously  
wrought, and as it must be extremely light, bamboo  
and rattan are almost wholly used, together  
with rice paper, in its construction.  
  
</p><p>Fig. 33 shows one form of the arrangement, in  
which the bamboo rib, A, in which only two sections  
are shown, as B, B, form the backbone, and  
these sections are secured together with pivot  
pins C. Each section has attached thereto a  
hoop, or circularly-formed rib, D, the rib passing  
through the section B, and these ribs are connected  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0118" n="95"/>    
together loosely by cords E, which run  
from one to the other, as shown.  
  
</p><p>These circular ribs, D, are designed to carry a  
plurality of light paper disks, F, which are attached  
at intervals, and they are placed at such  
angles that they serve as small wing surfaces or  
aeroplanes to hold the structure in flight.  
  

  
</p><p>THE MALAY KITE.&mdash;The Malay kite, of which  
Fig. 34 shows the structure, is merely made up of  
two cross sticks, A, B, the vertical strip, A, being  
bent and rigid, whereas the cross stick, B, is light  
and yielding, so that when in flight it will bend,  
as shown, and as a result it has wonderful stability  
due to the dihedral angles of the two surfaces.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0119" n="96"/>    
This kite requires no tail to give it stability.  
  

  
DIHEDRAL ANGLES.&mdash;This is a term to designate  
a form of disposing of the wings which has been  
found of great service in the single plane machines.  
A plane which is disposed at a rising  
  

  
angle, as A, A, Fig. 35, above the horizontal line,  
is called dihedral, or diedral.  
  
</p><p>This arrangement in monoplanes does away  
with the necessity of warping the planes, or changing  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0120" n="97"/>    
them while in flight. If, however, the angle  
is too great, the wind from either quarter is liable  
to raise the side that is exposed.  
  
</p><p>THE COMMON KITE.&mdash;While the Malay kite has  
only two points of cord attachment, both along  
the vertical rib, the common kite, as shown in  
Fig. 36, has a four-point connection, to which the  
  

  
flying cord is attached. Since this form has no  
dihedral angle, it is necessary to supply a tail,  
which thus serves to keep it in equilibrium, while  
in flight.  
  
</p><p>Various modifications have grown out of the  
Malay kite. One of these forms, designed by  
Eddy, is exactly like the Malay structure, but instead  
of having a light flexible cross piece, it is  
bent to resemble a bow, so that it is rigidly held  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0121" n="98"/>    
in a bent position, instead of permitting the wind  
to give it the dihedral angle.  
  
</p><p>THE BOW KITE.&mdash;Among the different types are  
  


  
the bow kite, Fig. 37, and the sexagonal structure,  
Fig. 38, the latter form affording an especially  
large surface.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0122" n="99"/>    
  
</p><p>THE BOX KITE.&mdash;The most marked improvement  
in the form of kites was made by Hargreaves,  
in 1885, and called the   
<hi rend="italic">box kite</hi>. It has wonderful  
stability, and its use, with certain modifications,  
in Weather Bureau experiments, have proven its  
value.  
  
</p><p>It is made in the form of two boxes, A, B, open  
at the ends, which are secured together by means  
of longitudinal bars, C, that extends from one to  
the other, so that they are held apart a distance,  
  

  
approximately, equal to the length of one of the  
boxes.  
  
</p><p>Their fore and aft stability is so perfect that  
the flying cord D is attached at one point only,  
and the sides of the boxes provide lateral stability  
to a marked degree.  
  
</p><p>THE VOISON BIPLANE.&mdash;This kind of kite furnished  
the suggestion for the Voison biplane,  
which was one of the earlier productions in flying  
machines.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0123" n="100"/>    
  
</p><p>Fig. 40 shows a perspective of the Voison plane,  
which has vertical planes A, A, at the ends, and  
also intermediate curtains B, B. This was found  
to be remarkably stable, but during its turning  
movements, or in high winds, was not satisfactory,  
and for that reason was finally abandoned.  
  
</p><p>LATERAL STABILITY IN KITES NOT CONCLUSIVE AS  
TO PLANES.&mdash;This is instanced to show that while  
such a form is admirably adapted for kite purposes,  
where vertical curtains are always in line  
  

  
with the wind movement, and the structure is held  
taut by a cord, the lateral effect, when used on a  
machine which does not at all times move in line  
with the moving air current. A condition is thus  
set up which destroys the usefulness of the box  
kite formation.  
  
</p><p>THE SPEAR KITE.&mdash;This is a novel kite, with  
remarkable steadiness and is usually made with  
the wings on the rear end larger than those on  
the forward end (Fig. 41), as thereby the cord  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0124" n="101"/>    
A can be attached to the spear midway between  
the two sets of wings.  
  
 
  
</p><p>THE CELLULAR KITE.&mdash;Following out the suggestion  
of the Hargreaves kite, numerous forms  
embodying the principle of the box structure were  
made and put on the market before the aeroplane  
became a reality.  
  

  
</p><p>A structure of this form is illustrated in Fig.  
42. Each box, as A, B, has therein a plurality of  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0125" n="102"/>    
vertical and horizontal partitions, so that a number  
of cells are provided, the two cell-like boxes  
being held apart by a bar C, axially arranged.  
  
</p><p>This type is remarkably stable, due to the small  
cells, and kites of this kind are largely used for  
making scientific experiments.  
  
</p><p>THE TETRAHEDRAL KITE.&mdash;Prof. Bell, inventor  
of the telephone, gave a great deal of study to  
  

  
kites, which resulted in the tetrahedral formation,  
as shown in Fig. 43.  
  
</p><p>The structure, apparently, is somewhat complicated,  
but an examination of a single pair of  
blades, as shown at A, shows that it is built up of  
triangularly-formed pieces, and that the openings  
between the pieces are equal to the latter, thereby  
providing a form of kite which possesses equilibrium  
to a great degree.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0126" n="103"/>    
  
</p><p>It has never been tried with power, and it is  
doubtful whether it would be successful as a sustaining  
surface for flying machines, for the same  
reasons that caused failure with the box-like formation  
of the Voison Machine.  
  
</p><p>THE DELTOID.&mdash;The deltoid is the simplest, and  
the most easily constructed of all the kites. It is  
usually made from stiff cardboard, A-shaped in  
  

  
outline, as shown in Figs. 44 and 45, and bent along  
a central line, as at A, forming two wings, each  
of which is a right-angled triangle.  
  
</p><p>The peculiarity of this formation is, that it has  
remarkable stability when used as a kite, with  
either end foremost. If a small weight is placed  
at the pointed end, and it is projected through the  
air, it will fly straight, and is but little affected  
by cross currents.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0127" n="104"/>    
  
</p><p>THE DUNNE FLYING MACHINE.&mdash;A top view of  
this biplane is shown in Fig. 46. The A-shaped  
disposition of the planes, gives it good lateral  
stability, but it has the disadvantage under which  
all aeroplanes labor, that the entire body of the  
machine must move on a fore and aft vertical  
plan in order to ascend or descend.  
  

  
</p><p>This is a true deltoid formation, as the angle of  
incidence of the planes is so disposed that when  
the planes are horizontal from end to end, the inclination  
is such as to make it similar to the deltoid  
kite referred to.  
  
</p><p>ROTATING KITE.&mdash;A type of kite unlike the  
others illustrated is a rotating structure, which  
gives great stability, due to the gyroscopic action  
on the supporting surfaces.  
  
</p><p>Fig. 47 shows a side view with the top in section.  
The supporting surface is umbrella-shaped.  
In fact, the ordinary umbrella will answer if not  
dished too much. An angularly-bent piece of wire  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0128" n="105"/>    
A, provided with loops B, B, at the ends, serve as  
bearings for the handle of the umbrella.  
  
</p><p>At the bend of the wire loop C, the cord D is  
attached. The lower side of the umbrella top has  
cup-shaped pockets E, near the margin, so arranged  
that their open ends project in the same  
direction, and the wind catching them rotates the  
circular plane.  
  

  
</p><p>KITE PRINCIPLES.&mdash;A careful study of the examples  
here given, will impress the novice with  
one important fact, which, in its effect has a more  
important bearing on successful flight, than all  
the bird study and speculations concerning its  
mysteries.  
  
</p><p>This fact, in essence, is, that the angle of the  
kite is the great factor in flight next to the power  
necessary to hold it. Aside from this, the comparison  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0129" n="106"/>    
between kites and aeroplanes is of no  
practical value.  
  
</p><p>Disregarding the element of momentum, the  
drift of a machine against a wind, is the same,  
dynamically, as a plane at rest with the wind  
moving past it. But there is this pronounced  
difference: The cord which supports the kite  
holds it so that the power is in one direction only.  
  
</p><p>When a side gust of wind strikes the kite it  
is moved laterally, in sympathy with the kite,  
hence the problem of lateral displacement is not  
the same as with the aeroplane.  
  
</p><p>LATERAL STABILITY IN KITES.&mdash;In the latter the  
power is definitely fixed with relation to the machine  
itself, and if we should assume that a plane  
with a power on it sufficient to maintain a flight  
of 40 miles an hour, should meet a wind moving  
at the same speed, the machine would be stationary  
in space.  
  
</p><p>Such a condition would be the same, so far as  
the angles of the planes are concerned, with a  
kite held by a string, but there all similarity in  
action ends.  
  
</p><p>The stabilizing quality of the kite may be perfect,  
as the wind varies from side to side, but the  
aeroplane, being free, moves to the right or to  
the left, and does not adjust itself by means of a  
fixed point, but by a movable one.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0130" n="107"/>    
  
</p><p>SIMILARITY OF FORE AND AFT CONTROL.&mdash;Fore  
and aft, however, the kite and aeroplane act the  
same. Fig. 48 shows a diagram which illustrates  
the forces which act on the kite, and by means  
of which it adjusts its angle automatically.  
  
</p><p>Let us assume that the kite A is flown from  
a cord B, so that its angle is 22&frac12; degrees, the  
  

  
wind being 15 miles per hour to maintain the  
cord B at that angle. When the wind increases  
to 20 miles an hour there is a correspondingly  
greater lift against the kite.  
  
</p><p>As its angle is fixed by means of the loop C,  
it cannot change its angle with reference to the  
cord, or independently of it, and its only course  
is to move up higher and assume the position  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0131" n="108"/>    
shown by the figure at D, and the angle of incidence  
of the kite is therefore changed to 15 degrees,  
or even to 10 degrees.  
  
</p><p>In the case of the aeroplane the effect is similar  
from the standpoint of power and disposition  
of the planes. If it has sufficient power, and the  
angle of the planes is not changed, it will ascend;  
if the planes are changed to 15 degrees to correspond  
with the kite angle it will remain stationary.  
  
</p><p>GLIDING FLIGHT.&mdash;The earliest attempt to fly  
by gliding is attributed to Oliver, a Monk of  
Malmesbury who, in 1065 prepared artificial  
wings, and with them jumped from a tower, being  
injured in the experiment.  
  
</p><p>Nearly 700 years later, in 1801, Resnier, a  
Frenchman, conducted experiments with varying  
results, followed by Berblinger, in 1842, and  
LeBris, a French sailor, in 1856.  
  
</p><p>In 1884, J. J. Montgomery, of California, designed  
a successful glider, and in 1889 Otto and  
Gustav Lilienthal made the most extended tests,  
in Germany, and became experts in handling  
gliders.  
  
</p><p>Pilcher, in England, was the next to take up the  
subject, and in 1893 made many successful glides,  
all of the foregoing machines being single plane  
surfaces, similar to the monoplane.  
  
</p><p>Long prior to 1896 Octave Chanute, an engineer,  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0132" n="109"/>    
gave the subject much study, and in that  
year made many remarkable flights, developing  
the double plane, now known as the biplane.  
  
</p><p>He was an ardent believer in the ability of man  
to fly by soaring means, and without using power  
for the purpose.  
  
</p><p>It is doubtful whether gliders contributed much  
to the art in the direction of laterally stabilizing  
aeroplanes. They taught useful lessons with respect  
to area and fore and aft control.  
  
</p><p>The kite gave the first impulse to seek out a  
means for giving equilibrium to planes, and  
Montgomery made a kite with warping wings as  
early as 1884.  
  
</p><p>Penaud, a Frenchman, in 1872, made a model  
aeroplane which had the stabilizing means in the  
tail. All these grew out of kite experiments; and  
all gliders followed the kite construction, or the  
principles involved in them, so that, really, there  
is but one intervening step between the kite and  
the flying machine, as we know it, the latter being  
merely kites with power attached, as substitutes  
for the cords.  
  
</p><p>ONE OF THE USES OF GLIDER EXPERIMENTS.&mdash;There is one direction in which gliders are valuable  
to the boy and to the novice who are interested  
in aviation. He may spend a lifetime in  
gliding and not advance in the art. It is questionable  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0133" n="110"/>    
whether in a scientific way it will be of  
any service to him; but experiments of this character  
give confidence, the ability to quickly grasp  
a situation, and it will thus teach self reliance in  
emergencies.  
  
</p><p>When in a glider quick thinking is necessary.  
The ability to shift from one position to another;  
to apply the weight where required instantaneously;  
to be able during the brief exciting moment  
of flight to know just what to do, requires alertness.  
  
</p><p>Some are so wedded to the earth that slight  
elevation disturbs them. The sensation in a  
glider while in flight is unlike any other experience.  
It is like riding a lot of tense springs, and the  
exhilaration in gliding down the side of a hill,  
with the feet free and body suspended, is quite  
different from riding in an aeroplane with power  
attached.  
  
</p><p>HINTS IN GLIDING.&mdash;It seems to be a difficult  
matter to give any advice in the art of gliding. It  
is a feat which seems to necessitate experiment  
from first to last. During the hundreds of tests  
personally made, and after witnessing thousands  
of attempts, there seems to be only a few suggestions  
or possible directions in which caution might  
be offered.  
  
</p><p>First, in respect to the position of the body at  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0134" n="111"/>    
the moment of launching. The glider is usually  
so made that in carrying it, preparatory to making  
the run and the leap required to glide, it is held  
so that it balances in the hands.  
  
</p><p>Now the center of air pressure in gliding may  
not be at the same point as its sustaining weight  
when held by the hand, and furthermore, as the  
arm-pits, by which the body of the experimenter  
are held while gliding, are not at the same point,  
but to the rear of the hands, the moment the glider  
is launched too great a weight is brought to the  
rear margin of the planes, hence its forward end  
lifts up.  
  
</p><p>This condition will soon manifest itself, and be  
corrected by the experimenter; but there is another  
difficulty which is not so easy to discover  
and so quick to remedy, and that is the swing of  
the legs the moment the operator leaves the  
ground.  
  
</p><p>The experimenter learns, after many attempts,  
that gliding is a matter of a few feet only, and he  
anticipates landing too soon, and the moment he  
leaps from the ground the legs are swung forwardly  
ready to alight.  
  
</p><p>This is done unconsciously, just as a jumper  
swings his legs forwardly in the act of alighting.  
Such a motion naturally disturbs the fore and aft  
stability of the gliding machine, by tilting up the  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0135" n="112"/>    
forward margin, and it banks against the air,  
instead of gliding.  
  
</p><p>The constant fear of all gliders is, that the  
machine will point downwardly, and his motion,  
as well as the position of the body, tend to shoot  
it upwardly, instead.</p>

</div1><div1 type="chapter" n="9" id="d18">  
<head>CHAPTER IX<lb/>  
AEROPLANE CONSTRUCTION</head>  
  
<p>As may be inferred from the foregoing statements,  
there are no definite rules for the construction  
of either type of flying machine, as the  
flying models vary to such an extent that it is  
difficult to take either of them as a model to represent  
the preferred type of construction.  
  
</p><p>LATERAL, AND FORE AND AFT.&mdash;The term   
<hi rend="italic">lateral</hi>  
should be understood, as applied to aeroplanes.  
It is always used to designate the direction at  
right angles to the movement of the machine.  
  
<hi rend="italic">Fore and aft</hi> is a marine term meaning   
<hi rend="italic">lengthwise</hi>,  
or from front to rear, hence is always at right  
angles to the lateral direction.  
  
</p><p>The term   
<hi rend="italic">transverse</hi> is equivalent to lateral,  
in flying machine parlance, but there is this  
distinction:   
<hi rend="italic">Transverse</hi> has reference to a machine  
or object which, like the main planes of an aeroplane,  
are broader, (that is,&mdash;from end to end)  
than their length, (from front to rear).  
  
</p><p>On the other hand, lateral has reference to side  
branches, as, for instance, the monoplane wings,  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0137" n="114"/>    
which branch out from the sides of the fore and  
aft body.  
  
</p><p>STABILITY AND STABILIZATION.&mdash;These terms constantly  
appear in describing machines and their  
operations. If the flying structure, whatever it  
may be, has means whereby it is kept from rocking  
from side to side, it has stability, which is usually  
designated as   
<hi rend="italic">lateral stability</hi>. The mechanism  
for doing this is called a   
<hi rend="italic">stabilizer</hi>.  
  
</p><p>THE WRIGHT SYSTEM.&mdash;The Wright machine has  
reference solely to the matter of laterally controlling  
the flying structure, and does not pertain  
to the form or shape of the planes.  
  
</p><p>In Fig. 49 A designates the upper and lower  
planes of a Wright machine, with the peculiar  
rounded ends. The ends of the planes are so  
arranged that the rear margins may be raised or  
lowered, independently of the other portions of  
the planes, which are rigid. This movement is  
indicated in sketch 1, where the movable part B  
is, as we might say, hinged along the line C.  
  
</p><p>The dotted line D on the right hand end, shows  
how the section is depressed, while the dotted  
lines E at the left hand end shows the section  
raised. It is obvious that the downturned ends,  
as at D, will give a positive angle at one end of the  
planes, and the upturned wings E at the other end  
will give a negative angle, and thus cause the right  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0138" n="115"/>    
  

  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0139" n="116"/>    
  
hand end to raise, and the other end to move  
downwardly, as the machine moves forwardly  
through the air.  
  
</p><p>CONTROLLING THE WARPING ENDS.&mdash;Originally  
the Wrights controlled these warping sections by  
means of a cradle occupied by the aviator, so that  
the cradle would move or rock, dependent on the  
tilt of the machine. This was what was termed  
  
<hi rend="italic">automatic</hi> control. This was found to be unsatisfactory,  
and the control has now been placed so  
that it connects with a lever and is operated by  
the aviator, and is called   
<hi rend="italic">Manually-operated</hi> control.  
  
</p><p>In all forms of control the wings on one side are  
depressed on one side and correspondingly elevated  
on the other.  
  
</p><p>THE CURTIS WINGS.&mdash;Curtis has small wings,  
or ailerons, intermediate the supporting surfaces,  
and at their extremities, as shown in sketch 2.  
These are controlled by a shoulder rack or swinging  
frame operated by the driver, so that the body  
in swinging laterally will change the two wings  
at the same time, but with angles in different  
directions.  
  
</p><p>THE FARMAN AILERONS.&mdash;Farman's disposition  
is somewhat different, as shown in sketch 3. The  
wings are hinged to the upper planes at their rear  
edges, and near the extremities of the planes.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0140" n="117"/>    
Operating wires lead to a lever within reach of the  
aviator, and, by this means, the wings are held at  
any desired angle, or changed at will.  
  
</p><p>The difficulty of using any particular model, is  
true, also, of the arrangement of the fore and aft  
control, as well as the means for laterally stabilizing  
it. In view of this we shall submit a general  
form, which may be departed from at will.  
  
</p><p>FEATURES WELL DEVELOPED.&mdash;Certain features  
are fairly well developed, however. One is the  
angle of the supporting plane, with reference to  
the frame itself; and the other is the height at  
which the tail and rudder should be placed above  
the surface of the ground when the machine is at  
rest.  
  
</p><p>DEPRESSING THE REAR END.&mdash;This latter is a  
matter which must be taken into consideration,  
because in initiating flight the rear end of the  
frame is depressed in order to give a sufficient  
angle to the supporting planes so as to be able to  
inaugurate flight.  
  
</p><p>In order to commence building we should have  
some definite idea with respect to the power, as  
this will, in a measure, determine the area of the  
supporting surfaces, as a whole, and from this  
the sizes of the different planes may be determined.  
  
</p><p>DETERMINING THE SIZE.&mdash;Suppose we decide on  
300 square feet of sustaining surface. This may  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0141" n="118"/>    
require a 30, a 40 or a 50 horse power motor,  
dependent on the speed required, and much higher  
power has been used on that area.  
  
</p><p>However, let us assume that a forty horse power  
motor is available, our 300 square feet of surface  
may be put into two planes, each having 150 square  
feet of surface, which would make each 5' by 30'  
in size; or, it may be decided to make the planes  
narrower, and proportionally longer. This is immaterial.  
The shorter the planes transversely,  
the greater will be the stability, and the wider the  
planes the less will be the lift, comparatively.  
  
</p><p>RULE FOR PLACING THE PLANES.&mdash;The rule for  
placing the planes is to place them apart a distance  
equal to the width of the planes themselves,  
so that if we decide on making them five feet wide,  
they should be placed at least five feet apart.  
This rule, while it is an admirable one for slow  
movements or when starting flight, is not of any  
advantage while in rapid flight.  
  
</p><p>If the machine is made with front and rear  
horizontally-disposed rudders, or elevators, they  
also serve as sustaining surfaces, which, for the  
present will be disregarded.  
  
</p><p>Lay off a square A, Fig. 49a, in which the vertical  
lines B, B, and the horizontal lines C, C, are  
5' long, and draw a cross D within this, the lines  
running diagonally from the corners.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0142" n="119"/>    
  
</p><p>Now step off from the center cross line D, three  
spaces, each five feet long, to a point E, and join  
this point by means of upper and lower bars F,  
  

  
G, with the upper and lower planes, so as to form  
the tail frame.  
  
</p><p>As shown in Fig. 50, the planes should now be  
indicated, and placed at an angle of about 8 degrees  
angle, which are illustrated, H being the  
  

  
upper and I the lower plane. Midway between the  
forward edges of the two planes, is a horizontal  
line J, extending forwardly, and by stepping off  
the width of two planes, a point K is made, which  
forms the apex of a frame L, the rear ends of the  
  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0143" n="120"/>    
  
 
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0144" n="121"/>    
bars being attached to the respective planes H, I,  
at their forward edges.  
  
</p><p>ELEVATING PLANES.&mdash;We must now have the general  
side elevation of the frame, the planes, their  
angles, the tail and the rudder support, and the  
frame for the forward elevator.  
  
</p><p>To this may be added the forward elevating  
plane L, the rear elevator, or tail M, and the vertical  
steering rudder N.  
  
</p><p>The frame which supports the structure thus  
described, may be made in a variety of ways, the  
object being to provide a resilient connection for  
the rear wheel O.  
  
</p><p>Fig. 52 shows a frame which is simple in construction  
and easily attached. The lower fore  
and aft side bars P have the single front wheel  
axle at the forward end, and the aft double wheels  
at the rear end, a flexible bar Q, running from the  
rear wheel axle to the forward end of the lower  
plane.  
  
</p><p>A compression spring R is also mounted between  
the bar and rear end of the lower plane to  
take the shock of landing. The forward end of  
the bar P has a brace S extending up to the front  
edge of the lower plane, and another brace T connects  
the bars P, S, with the end of the forwardly-projecting frame.  
  
</p><p>The full page view, Fig. 53, represents a plan  
  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0145" n="122"/>    
  

  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0146" n="123"/>    
view, with one of the wings cut away, showing the  
general arrangement of the frame, and the three  
wheels required for support, together with the  
brace bars referred to.  
  
</p><p>The necessity of the rear end elevation will  
now be referred to. The tail need not, necessarily,  
be located at a point on a horizontal line  
between the planes. It may be higher, or lower  
than the planes, but it should not be in a position  
  

  
to touch the ground when the machine is about  
to ascend.  
  
</p><p>The angle of ascension in the planes need not  
exceed 25 degrees so the frame does not require  
an angle of more than 17 degrees. This is shown  
in Fig. 54, where the machine is in a position  
ready to take the air at that angle, leaving ample  
room for the steering rudder.  
  
</p><p>ACTION IN ALIGHTING.&mdash;Also, in alighting, the  
machine is banked, practically in the same position  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0147" n="124"/>    
thus shown, so that it alights on the rear  
wheels O.  
  
</p><p>The motor U is usually mounted so its shaft is  
midway between the planes, the propeller V being  
connected directly with the shaft, and being behind  
the planes, is on a medial line with the  
machine.  
  
</p><p>The control planes L, M, N, are all connected up  
by means of flexible wires with the aviator at the  
set W, the attachments being of such a character  
that their arrangement will readily suggest themselves  
to the novice.  
  
</p><p>THE MONOPLANE.&mdash;From a spectacular standpoint  
a monoplane is the ideal flying machine. It  
is graceful in outline, and from the fact that it  
closely approaches the form of the natural flyer,  
seems to be best adapted as a type, compared with  
the biplane.  
  
</p><p>THE COMMON FLY.&mdash;So many birds have been  
cited in support of the various flying theories that  
the house fly, as an example has been disregarded.  
We are prone to overlook the small insect, but it  
is, nevertheless, a sample which is just as potent  
to show the efficiency of wing surface as the condor  
or the vulture.  
  
</p><p>The fly has greater mobility than any other flying  
creature. By the combined action of its legs  
and wings it can spring eighteen inches in the  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0148" n="125"/>    
tenth of a second; and when in flight can change  
its course instantaneously.  
  
</p><p>If a sparrow had the same dexterity, proportionally,  
it could make a flight of 800 feet in the  
same time. The posterior legs of the fly are the  
  

  
same length as its body, which enable it to spring  
from its perch with amazing facility.  
  
</p><p>The wing surface, proportioned to its body and  
weight, is no less a matter for wonder and consideration.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0149" n="126"/>    
  
</p><p>In Fig. 55 is shown the outlines of the fly with  
outstretched wings. Fig. 56 represents it with  
the wing folded, and Fig. 57 is a view of a wing  
with the relative size of the top of the body shown  
in dotted lines.  
  

  
</p><p>The first thing that must attract attention, after  
a careful study is the relative size of the body  
and wing surface. Each wing is slightly smaller  
than the upper surface of the body, and the thickness  
of the body is equal to each wing spread.  
  

  
</p><p>The weight, compared with sustaining surface,  
if expressed in understandable terms, would be  
equal to sixty pounds for every square foot of surface.  
  
</p><p>STREAM LINES.&mdash;The next observation is, that  
what are called   
<hi rend="italic">stream lines</hi> do not exist in the fly.  
Its head is as large in cross section as its body,  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0150" n="127"/>    
with the slightest suggestion only, of a pointed  
end. Its wings are perfectly flat, forming a true  
plane, not dished, or provided with a   
<hi rend="italic">cambre</hi>, even,  
that upward curve, or bulge on the top of the aeroplane  
surface, which seems to possess such a fascination  
for many   
<hi rend="italic">bird flight</hi> advocates.  
  
</p><p>It will also be observed that the wing connection  
with the body is forward of the line A, which  
represents the point at which the body will balance  
itself, and this line passes through the wings  
so that there is an equal amount of supporting  
surface fore and aft of the line.  
  
</p><p>Again, the wing attachment is at the upper side  
of the body, and the vertical dimension of the  
body, or its thickness, is equal to four-fifths of the  
length of he wing.  
  
</p><p>The wing socket permits a motion similar to a  
universal joint, Fig. 55 showing how the inner  
end of the wing has a downward bend where it  
joins the back, as at B.  
  
</p><p>THE MONOPLANE FORM.&mdash;For the purpose of  
making comparisons the illustrations of the monoplane  
show a machine of 300 square feet of surface,  
which necessitates a wing spread of forty  
feet from tip to tip, so that the general dimensions  
of each should be 18&frac12; feet by 8&frac12; feet at its  
widest point.  
  
</p><p>First draw a square forty feet each way, as in  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0151" n="128"/>    
Fig. 58, and through this make a horizontal line  
1, and four intermediate vertical lines are then  
drawn, as 2, 3, 4, 5, thus providing five divisions,  
each eight feet wide. In the first division the  
planes A, B, are placed, and the tail, or elevator  
C, is one-half the width of the last division.  
  

  
</p><p>The frame is 3&frac12; feet wide at its forward end,  
and tapers down to a point at its rear end, where  
the vertical control plane D is hinged, and the  
cross struts E, E, are placed at the division lines  
3, 4, 5.  
  
</p><p>The angles of the planes, with relation to the  
frame, are usually greater than in the biplane,  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0152" n="129"/>    
for the reason that the long tail plane requires  
a greater angle to be given to the planes when  
arising; or, instead of this, the planes A, B, are  
mounted high enough to permit of sufficient angle  
for initiating flight without injuring the tail D.  
  
</p><p>Some monoplanes are built so they have a support  
on wheels placed fore and aft. In others  
the tail is supported by curved skids, as shown  
at A, Fig. 59, in which case the forward supporting  
  

  
wheels are located directly beneath the planes.  
As the planes are at about eighteen degrees  
angle, relative to the frame, and the tail plane  
B is at a slight negative angle of incidence, as  
shown at the time when the engine is started, the  
air rushing back from the propeller, elevates the  
tail, and as the machine moves forwardly over  
the ground, the tail raises still higher, so as to  
give a less angle of incidence to the planes while  
skimming along the surface of the ground.  
  
</p><p>In order to mount, the tail is suddenly turned  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0153" n="130"/>    
to assume a sharp negative angle, thus swinging  
the tail downwardly, and this increases the angle  
of planes to such an extent that the machine leaves  
the ground, after which the tail is brought to the  
proper angle to assure horizontal flight.  
  
</p><p>The drawing shows a skid at the forward end,  
attached to the frame which carries the wheels.  
The wheels are mounted beneath springs so that  
when the machine alights the springs yield sufficiently  
to permit the skids to strike the ground,  
and they, therefore, act as brakes, to prevent the  
machine from traveling too far.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X<lb/>  
POWER AND ITS APPLICATION</head>  
  
<p>THIS is a phase of the flying machine which has  
the greatest interest to the boy. He instinctively  
sees the direction in which the machine has its  
life,&mdash;its moving principle. Planes have their  
fascination, and propellers their mysterious elements,  
but power is the great and absorbing question  
with him.  
  
</p><p>We shall try to make its application plain in  
the following pages. We have nothing to do here  
with the construction and operation of the motor  
itself, as, to do that justice, would require pages.  
  
</p><p>FEATURES IN POWER APPLICATION.&mdash;It will be  
more directly to the point to consider the following  
features of the power and its application:  
  
</p><p>1. The amount of power necessary.  
  
</p><p>2. How to calculate the power applied.  
  
</p><p>3. Its mounting.  
  
  
</p><p>WHAT AMOUNT OF POWER IS NECESSARY.&mdash;In the  
consideration of any power plant certain calculations  
must be made to determine what is required.  
A horse power means the lifting of a certain  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0155" n="132"/>    
weight, a definite distance, within a specified  
time.  
  
</p><p>If the weight of the vehicle, with its load, are  
known, and its resistance, or the character of the  
roadway is understood, it is a comparatively easy  
matter to calculate just how much power must be  
exerted to overcome that resistance, and move the  
vehicle a certain speed.  
  
</p><p>In a flying machine the same thing is true, but  
while these problems may be known in a general  
way, the aviator has several unknown elements  
ever present, which make estimates difficult to  
solve.  
  
</p><p>THE PULL OF THE PROPELLER.&mdash;Two such factors  
are ever present. The first is the propeller  
pull. The energy of a motor, when put into a  
propeller, gives a pull of less than eight pounds  
for every horse power exerted.  
  
</p><p>FOOT POUNDS.&mdash;The work produced by a motor  
is calculated in   
<hi rend="italic">Foot Pounds</hi>. If 550 pounds  
should be lifted, or pulled, one foot in one second  
of time, it would be equal to   
<hi rend="italic">one horse power</hi>.  
  
</p><p>But here we have a case where one horse power  
pulls only eight pounds, a distance of one foot  
within one second of time, and we have utilized  
less than one sixty-fifth of the actual energy produced.  
  
</p><p>SMALL AMOUNT OF POWER AVAILABLE.&mdash;This is  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0156" n="133"/>    
due to two things: First, the exceeding lightness  
of the air, and its great elasticity; and, second,  
the difficulty of making a surface which, when it  
strikes the air, will get a sufficient grip to effect  
a proper pull.  
  
</p><p>Now it must be obvious, that where only such  
a small amount of energy can be made available,  
in a medium as elusive as air, the least change, or  
form, of the propeller, must have an important  
bearing in the general results.  
  
</p><p>HIGH PROPELLER SPEED IMPORTANT.&mdash;Furthermore,  
all things considered, high speed is important  
in the rotation of the propeller, up to a certain  
point, beyond which the pull decreases in  
proportion to the speed. High speed makes a  
vacuum behind the blade and thus decreases the  
effective pull of the succeeding blade.  
  
</p><p>WIDTH AND PITCH OF BLADES.&mdash;If the blade is  
too wide the speed of the engine is cut down to a  
point where it cannot exert the proper energy; if  
the pitch is very small then it must turn further to  
get the same thrust, so that the relation of diameter,  
pitch and speed, are three problems far from  
being solved.  
  
</p><p>It may be a question whether the propeller form,  
as we now know it, is anything like the true or  
ultimate shape, which will some day be discovered.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0157" n="134"/>    
  
</p><p>EFFECT OF INCREASING PROPELLER PULL.&mdash;If the  
present pull could be doubled what a wonderful  
revolution would take place in aerial navigation,  
and if it were possible to get only a quarter of  
the effective pull of an engine, the results would  
be so stupendous that the present method of flying  
would seem like child's play in comparison.  
  
</p><p>It is in this very matter,&mdash;the application of  
the power, that the bird, and other flying creatures  
so far excel what man has done. Calculations  
made with birds as samples, show that many  
of them are able to fly with such a small amount  
of power that, if the same energy should be applied  
to a flying machine, it would scarcely drive  
it along the ground.  
  
</p><p>DISPOSITION OF THE PLANES.&mdash;The second factor  
is the disposition or arrangement of the planes  
with relation to the weight. Let us illustrate this  
with a concrete example:  
  
</p><p>We have an aeroplane with a sustaining surface  
of 300 square feet which weighs 900 pounds,  
or 30 pounds per square foot of surface.  
  
</p><p>DIFFERENT SPEEDS WITH SAME POWER.&mdash;Now, we  
may be able to do two things with an airship under  
those conditions. It may be propelled through  
the air thirty miles an hour, or sixty miles, with  
the expenditure of the same power.  
  
</p><p>An automobile, if propelled at sixty, instead of  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0158" n="135"/>    
thirty miles an hour, would require an additional  
power in doing so, but an airship acts differently,  
within certain limitations.  
  
</p><p>When it is first set in motion its effective pull  
may not be equal to four pounds for each horse  
power, due to the slow speed of the propeller, and  
also owing to the great angle of incidence which  
resists the forward movement of the ship.  
  
</p><p>INCREASE OF SPEED ADDS TO RESISTANCE.&mdash;Finally,  
as speed increases, the angle of the planes  
decrease, resistance is less, and up to a certain  
point the pull of the propeller increases; but beyond  
that the vacuum behind the blades becomes  
so great as to bring down the pull, and there is  
thus a balance,&mdash;a sort of mutual governing motion  
which, together, determine the ultimate speed  
of the aeroplane.  
  
</p><p>HOW POWER DECREASES WITH SPEED.&mdash;If now,  
with the same propeller, the speed should be  
doubled, the ship would go no faster, because the  
bite of the propeller on the air would be ineffective,  
hence it will be seen that it is not the amount  
of power in itself, that determines the speed, but  
the shape of the propeller, which must be so made  
that it will be most effective at the speed required  
for the ship.  
  
</p><p>While that is true when speed is the matter of  
greatest importance, it is not the case where it is  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0159" n="136"/>    
desired to effect a launching. In that case the  
propeller must be made so that its greatest pull  
will be at a slow speed. This means a wider  
blade, and a greater pitch, and a comparatively  
greater pull at a slow speed.  
  
</p><p>No such consideration need be given to an automobile.  
The constant accretion of power adds  
to its speed. In flying machines the aviator must  
always consider some companion factor which  
must be consulted.  
  
</p><p>HOW TO CALCULATE THE POWER APPLIED.&mdash;In a  
previous chapter reference was made to a plane  
at an angle of forty-five degrees, to which two  
scales were attached, one to get its horizontal pull,  
or drift, and the other its vertical pull, or lift.  
  
</p><p>PULLING AGAINST AN ANGLE.&mdash;Let us take the  
same example in our aeroplane. Assuming that  
it weighs 900 pounds, and that the angle of the  
planes is forty-five degrees. If we suppose that  
the air beneath the plane is a solid, and frictionless,  
and a pair of scales should draw it up the incline,  
the pull in doing so would be one-half of its  
weight, or 450 pounds.  
  
</p><p>It must be obvious, therefore, that its force, in  
moving downwardly, along the surface A, Fig. 60,  
would be 450 pounds.  
  
</p><p>The incline thus shown has thereon a weight B,  
mounted on wheels a, and the forwardly-projecting  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0160" n="137"/>    
cord represents the power, or propeller pull,  
which must, therefore, exert a force of 450 pounds  
to keep it in a stationary position against the surface  
A.  
  
</p><p>In such a case the thrust along the diagonal  
line E would be 900 pounds, being the composition  
of the two forces pulling along the lines D, F.  
  
</p><p>THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL PULL.&mdash;Now it  
must be obvious, that if the incline takes half of  
  

  
the weight while it is being drawn forwardly, in  
the line of D, if we had a propeller drawing along  
that line, which has a pull of 450 pounds, it would  
maintain the plane in flight, or, at any rate hold  
it in space, assuming that the air should be moving  
past the plane.  
  
</p><p>The table of   
<hi rend="italic">lift and drift</hi> gives a fairly accurate  
method of determining this factor, and we refer to  
the chapter on that subject which will show the  
manner of making the calculations.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0161" n="138"/>    
  
</p><p>THE POWER MOUNTING.&mdash;More time and labor  
has been wasted, in airship experiments, in poor  
motor mounting, than in any other direction.  
This is especially true where two propellers are  
used, or where the construction is such that the  
propeller is mounted some distance from the motor.  
  
</p><p>SECURING THE PROPELLER TO THE SHAFT.&mdash;But  
even where the propeller is mounted on the engine  
shaft, too little care is exercised to fix it securely.  
The vibratory character of the mounting  
makes this a matter of first importance. If there  
is a solid base a poorly fixed propeller will hold  
much longer, but it is the extreme vibration that  
causes the propeller fastening to give way.  
  
</p><p>VIBRATIONS.&mdash;If experimenters realized that an  
insecure, shaking, or weaving bed would cause a  
loss of from ten to fifteen per cent. in the pull of  
the propeller, more care and attention would be  
given to this part of the structure.  
  
</p><p>WEAKNESSES IN MOUNTING.&mdash;The general weaknesses  
to which attention should be directed are,  
first, the insecure attachment of the propeller to  
the shaft; second, the liability of the base to  
weave; or permit of a torsional movement; third,  
improper bracing of the base to the main body of  
the aeroplane.  
  
</p><p>If the power is transferred from the cylinder  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0162" n="139"/>    
to the engine shaft where it could deliver its output  
without the use of a propeller, it would not  
be so important to consider the matter of vibration;  
but the propeller, if permitted to vibrate,  
or dance about, absorbs a vast amount of energy,  
while at the same time cutting down its effective  
pull.  
  
</p><p>Aside from this it is dangerous to permit the  
slightest displacement while the engine is running.  
Any looseness is sure to grow worse, instead  
of better, and many accidents have been  
registered by bolts which have come loose from  
excessive vibration. It is well, therefore, to have  
each individual nut secured, or properly locked,  
which is a matter easily done, and when so secured  
there is but little trouble in going over the machine  
to notice just how much more the nut must  
be taken up to again make it secure.  
  
</p><p>THE GASOLINE TANK.&mdash;What horrid details have  
been told of the pilots who have been burned to  
death with the escaping gasoline after an accident,  
before help arrived. There is no excuse for  
such dangers. Most of such accidents were due  
to the old practice of making the tanks of exceedingly  
light or thin material, so that the least  
undue jar would tear a hole at the fastening  
points, and thus permit the gasoline to escape.  
  
</p><p>A thick copper tank is by far the safest, as this  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0163" n="140"/>    
metal will not readily rupture by the wrench which  
is likely in landing.  
  
</p><p>WHERE TO LOCATE THE TANK.&mdash;There has been  
considerable discussion as to the proper place to  
locate the tank. Those who advocate its placement  
overhead argue that in case of an accident  
the aeroplane is likely to overturn, and the tank  
will, therefore, be below the pilot. Those who  
believe it should be placed below, claim that in  
case of overturning it is safer to have the tank  
afire above than below.  
  
</p><p>DANGER TO THE PILOT.&mdash;The great danger to the  
pilot, in all cases of accidents, lies in the overturning  
of the machine. Many have had accidents  
where the machine landed right side up, even  
where the fall was from a great height, and the  
only damage to the aviator was bruises. Few, if  
any, pilots have escaped where the machine has  
overturned.  
  
</p><p>It is far better, in case the tank is light, to have  
it detached from its position, when the ship strikes  
the earth, because in doing so, it will not be so  
likely to burn the imprisoned aviator.  
  
</p><p>In all cases the tank should be kept as far away  
from the engine as possible. There is no reason  
why it cannot be placed toward the tail end of  
the machine, a place of safety for two reasons:  
First, it is out of the reach of any possible danger  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0164" n="141"/>    
from fire; and, second, the accidents in the  
past show that the tail frame is the least likely to  
be injured.  
  
</p><p>In looking over the illustrations taken from the  
accidents, notice how few of the tails are even  
disarranged, and in many of them, while the entire  
fore body and planes were crushed to atoms,  
the tail still remained as a relic, to show its comparative  
freedom from the accident.  
  
</p><p>In all monoplanes the tail really forms part of  
the supporting surface of the machine, and the  
adding of the weight of the gasoline would be  
placing but little additional duty on the tail, and  
it could be readily provided for by a larger tail  
surface, if required.  
  
</p><p>THE CLOSED-IN BODY.&mdash;The closed-in body is a  
vast improvement, which has had the effect of  
giving greater security to the pilot, but even this  
is useless in case of overturning.  
  
</p><p>STARTING THE MACHINE.&mdash;The direction in which  
improvements have been slow is in the starting  
of the machine. The power is usually so mounted  
that the pilot has no control over the starting,  
as he is not in a position to crank it.  
  
</p><p>The propeller being mounted directly on the  
shaft, without the intervention of a clutch, makes  
it necessary, while on the ground, for the propeller  
to be started by some one outside, while  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0165" n="142"/>    
others hold the machine until it attains the proper  
speed.  
  
</p><p>This could be readily remedied by using a  
clutch, but in the past this has been regarded as  
one of the weight luxuries that all have been trying  
to avoid. Self starters are readily provided,  
and this with the provision that the propeller can  
be thrown in or out at will, would be a vast improvement  
in all machines.  
  
</p><p>PROPELLERS WITH VARYING PITCH.&mdash;It is growing  
more apparent each day, that a new type of  
propeller must be devised which will enable the  
pilot to change the pitch, as the speed increases,  
and to give a greater pitch, when alighting, so  
as to make the power output conform to the conditions.  
  
</p><p>Such propellers, while they may be dangerous,  
and much heavier than the rigid type, will, no  
doubt, appear in time, and the real improvement  
would be in the direction of having the blades  
capable of automatic adjustment, dependent on  
the wind pressure, or the turning speed, and thus  
not impose this additional duty on the pilot.</p>

<p>THE ANEMOMETER.&mdash;It requires an expert to  
judge the force or the speed of a wind, and even  
they will go astray in their calculations. It is  
an easy matter to make a little apparatus which  
will accurately indicate the speed. A device of  
this kind is called an   
<hi rend="italic">Anemometer</hi>.  
  
</p><p>Two other instruments have grown out of this,  
one to indicate the   
<hi rend="italic">pressure</hi>, and the other the  
  
<hi rend="italic">direction</hi> of the moving air current.  
  
</p><p>THE ANEMOGRAPH.&mdash;While these instruments indicate,  
they are also made so they will record the  
speed, the pressure and the direction, and the device  
for recording the speed and pressure is called  
a Anemograph.  
  
</p><p>All these instruments may be attached to the  
same case, and thus make a handy little device,  
which will give all the information at a glance.  
  
</p><p>THE ANEMOMETROGRAPH.&mdash;This device for recording,  
as well as indicating the speed, pressure  
and direction, is called an   
<hi rend="italic">Anemometrograph</hi>,  
The two important parts of the combined apparatus,  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0167" n="144"/>    
for the speed and pressure, are illustrated,  
to show the principle involved. While the speed  
will give the pressure, it is necessary to make a  
calculation to get the result while the machine does  
this for you.  
  

  
</p><p>THE SPEED INDICATOR.&mdash;Four hemispherical  
cups A are mounted on four radiating arms B,  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0168" n="145"/>    
which are secured to a vertical stem C, and  
adapted to rotate in suitable bearings in a  
case, which, for convenience in explaining, is not  
shown.  
  
</p><p>On the lower end of the stem C, is a small bevel  
pinion, which meshes with a smaller bevel pinion  
within the base. This latter is on a shaft which  
carries a small gear on its other end, to mesh  
  

  
with a larger gear on a shaft which carries a  
pointer D that thus turns at a greatly reduced  
speed, so that it can be easily timed.  
  
</p><p>AIR PRESSURE INDICATOR.&mdash;This little apparatus  
is readily made of a base A which is provided  
with two uprights B, C, through the upper ends of  
which are holes to receive a horizontally-disposed  
bar D. One end of the bar is a flat plane surface  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0169" n="146"/>    
E, which is disposed at right angles to the  
bar, and firmly fixed thereto.  
  
</p><p>The other end of the bar has a lateral pin to  
serve as a pivot for the end of a link F, its other  
end being hinged to the upper end of a lever G,  
which is pivoted to the post C, a short distance  
below the hinged attachment of the link F, so  
that the long end of the pointer which is constituted  
by the lever G is below its pivot, and has,  
therefore, a long range of movement.  
  
</p><p>A spring I between the upper end of the pointer  
G and the other post B, serves to hold the pointer  
at a zero position. A graduated scale plate J,  
within range of the pointer will show at a glance  
the pressure in pounds of the moving wind, and  
for this purpose it would be convenient to make  
the plane E exactly one foot square.  
  
</p><p>DETERMINING THE PRESSURE FROM THE SPEED.&mdash;These two instruments can be made to check each  
other and thus pretty accurately enable you to  
determine the proper places to mark the pressure  
indicator, as well as to make the wheels in the  
anemometer the proper size to turn the pointer  
in seconds when the wind is blowing at a certain  
speed, say ten miles per hour.  
  
</p><p>Suppose the air pressure indicator has the scale  
divided into quarter pound marks. This will  
make it accurate enough for all purposes.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0170" n="147"/>    
  
</p><p>CALCULATING PRESSURES FROM SPEED.&mdash;The following

miles per hour:

</table>  
  
</p><p>HOW THE FIGURES ARE DETERMINED.&mdash;The foregoing  
figures are determined in the following manner:  
As an example let us assume that the velocity  
of the wind is forty-five miles per hour. If  
this is squared, or 45 multiplied by 45, the product  
is 2025. In many calculations the mathematician  
employs what is called a   
<hi rend="italic">constant</hi>, a figure that  
never varies, and which is used to multiply or  
divide certain factors.  
  
</p><p>In this case the constant is 5/1000, or, as usually  
written, .005. This is the same as one two hundredths  
of the squared figure. That would make  
the problem as follows:  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0171" n="148"/>    
   
</p><p>45 X 45 = 2025 <!-- &x#00F7; --> 200 = 10.125; or,  
   
</p><p>45 X 45 -2025 X .005 = 10.125.  
  
  
</p><p>Again, twenty-five miles per hour would be  
25 X 25 = 625; and this multiplied by .005 equals  
2 pounds pressure.  
  
</p><p>CONVERTING HOURS INTO MINUTES.&mdash;It is sometimes  
confusing to think of miles per hour, when  
you wish to express it in minutes or seconds. A  
simple rule, which is not absolutely accurate, but  
is correct within a few feet, in order to express  
the speed in feet per minute, is to multiply the  
figure indicating the miles per hour, by 8 3/4.  
  
</p><p>To illustrate: If the wind is moving at the  
rate of twenty miles an hour, it will travel in that  
time 105,600 feet (5280 X 20). As there are sixty  
minutes in an hour, 105,600 divided by 60, equals  
1760 feet per minute. Instead of going through  
all this process of calculating the speed per minute,  
remember to multiply the speed in miles per  
hour by 90, which will give 1800 feet.  
  
</p><p>This is a little more then two per cent. above  
the correct figure. Again; 40 X 90 equals 3600.  
As the correct figure is 3520, a little mental calculation  
will enable you to correct the figures so  
as to get it within a few feet.  
  
</p><p>CHANGING SPEED HOURS TO SECONDS.&mdash;As one-sixtieth of the speed per minute will represent the  
rate of movement per second, it is a comparatively  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0172" n="149"/>    
easy matter to convert the time from speed in  
miles per hour to fraction of a mile traveled in  
a second, by merely taking one-half of the speed  
in miles, and adding it, which will very nearly express  
the true number of feet.  
  
</p><p>As examples, take the following: If the wind  
is traveling 20 miles an hour, it is easy to take  
one-half of 20, which is 10, and add it to 20, making  
30, as the number of feet per second. If the  
wind travels 50 miles per hour, add 25, making  
75, as the speed per second.  
  
</p><p>The correct speed per second of a wind traveling  
20 miles an hour is a little over 29 feet. At  
50 miles per hour, the correct figure is 73 1/3 feet,  
which show that the figures under this rule are  
within about one per cent. of being correct.  
  
</p><p>With the table before you it will be an easy  
matter, by observing the air pressure indicator,  
to determine the proper speed for the anemometer.  
Suppose it shows a pressure of two pounds,  
which will indicate a speed of twenty miles an  
hour. You have thus a fixed point to start from.  
  
</p><p>PRESSURE AS THE SQUARE OF THE SPEED.&mdash;Now  
it must not be assumed that if the pressure at  
twenty miles an hour is two pounds, that forty  
miles an hour it is four pounds. The pressure  
is as the square of the speed. This may be explained  
as follows: As the speed of the wind increases,  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0173" n="150"/>    
it has a more effective push against an  
object than its rate of speed indicates, and this  
is most simply expressed by saying that each time  
the speed is doubled the pressure is four times  
greater.  
  
</p><p>As an example of this, let us take a speed of ten  
miles an hour, which means a pressure of one-half pound. Double this speed, and we have 20  
miles. Multiplying one-half pound by 4, the result  
is 2 pounds. Again, double 20, which means  
40 miles, and multiplying 2 by 4, the result is 8.  
Doubling forty is eighty miles an hour, and again  
multiplying 8 by 4, we have 32 as the pounds pressure  
at a speed of 80 miles an hour.  
  
</p><p>The anemometer, however, is constant in its  
speed. If the pointer should turn once a second  
at 10 miles an hour, it would turn twice at 20 miles  
an hour, and four times a second at 40 miles an  
hour.  
  
</p><p>GYROSCOPIC BALANCE.&mdash;Some advance has been  
made in the use of the gyroscope for the purpose  
of giving lateral stability to an aeroplane. While  
the best of such devices is at best a makeshift,  
it is well to understand the principle on which they  
operate, and to get an understanding how they are  
applied.  
  
</p><p>THE PRINCIPLE INVOLVED.&mdash;The only thing  
known about the gyroscope is, that it objects to  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0174" n="151"/>    
changing the plane of its rotation. This statement  
must be taken with some allowance, however,  
as, when left free to move, it will change in  
one direction.  
  
</p><p>To explain this without being too technical, examine  
Fig. 63, which shows a gyroscopic top, one  
end of the rim A, which supports the rotating  
wheel B, having a projecting finger C, that is  
  

  
mounted on a pin-point on the upper end of the  
pedestal D.  
  
</p><p>When the wheel B is set in rotation it will maintain  
itself so that its axis E is horizontal, or at  
any other angle that the top is placed in when the  
wheel is spun. If it is set so the axis is horizontal  
the wheel B will rotate on a vertical plane,  
and it forcibly objects to any attempt to make it  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0175" n="152"/>    
turn except in the direction indicated by the  
curved arrows F.  
  
</p><p>The wheel B will cause the axis E to swing  
around on a horizontal plane, and this turning  
movement is always in a certain direction in relation  
to the turn of the wheel B, and it is obvious,  
therefore, that to make a gyroscope that  
will not move, or swing around an axis, the placing  
of two such wheels side by side, and rotated  
in opposite directions, will maintain them in a  
fixed position; this can also be accomplished by  
  
 
  
so mounting the two that one rotates on a plane  
at right angles to the other.  
  
</p><p>THE APPLICATION OF THE GYROSCOPE.&mdash;Without  
in any manner showing the structural details of  
the device, in its application to a flying machine,  
except in so far as it may be necessary to explain  
its operation, we refer to Fig. 64, which  
assumes that A represents the frame of the aeroplane,  
and B a frame for holding the gyroscopic  
wheel C, the latter being mounted so it rotates on  
a horizontal plane, and the frame B being hinged  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0176" n="153"/>    
fore and aft, so that it is free to swing to the right  
or to the left.  
  
</p><p>For convenience in explaining the action, the  
planes E are placed at right angles to their regular  
positions, F being the forward margin of the  
plane, and G the rear edge. Wires H connect  
the ends of the frame B with the respective  
planes, or ailerons, E, and another wire I joins  
the downwardly-projecting arms of the two  
ailerons, so that motion is transmitted to both at  
  

  
the same time, and by a positive motion in either  
direction.  
  
</p><p>In the second figure, 65, the frame of the aeroplane  
is shown tilted at an angle, so that its right  
side is elevated. As the gyroscopic wheel remains  
level it causes the aileron on the right side to  
change to a negative angle, while at the same  
time giving a positive angle to the aileron on the  
left side, which would, as a result, depress the  
right side, and bring the frame of the machine  
back to a horizontal position.  
  
</p><p>FORE AND AFT GYROSCOPIC CONTROL.&mdash;It is obvious  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0177" n="154"/>    
that the same application of this force may  
be applied to control the ship fore and aft, although  
it is doubtful whether such a plan would  
have any advantages, since this should be wholly  
within the control of the pilot.  
  
</p><p>Laterally the ship should not be out of balance;  
fore and aft this is a necessity, and as the great  
trouble with all aeroplanes is to control them  
laterally, it may well be doubted whether it would  
add anything of value to the machine by having  
an automatic fore and aft control, which might,  
in emergencies, counteract the personal control of  
the operator.  
  
</p><p>ANGLE INDICATOR.&mdash;In flight it is an exceedingly  
difficult matter for the pilot to give an accurate  
idea of the angle of the planes. If the air is  
calm and he is moving over a certain course, and  
knows, from experience, what his speed is, he may  
be able to judge of this factor, but he cannot tell  
what changes take place under certain conditions  
during the flight.  
  
</p><p>For this purpose a simple little indicator may  
be provided, shown in Fig. 66, which is merely a  
vertical board A, with a pendulum B, swinging  
fore and aft from a pin a which projects out  
from the board a short distance above its center.  
  
</p><p>The upper end of the pendulum has a heart-shaped wire structure D, that carries a sliding  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0178" n="155"/>    
weight E. Normally, when the aeroplane is on  
an even keel, or is even at an angle, the weight  
E rests within the bottom of the loop D, but  
should there be a sudden downward lurch or a  
quick upward inclination, which would cause the  
pendulum below to rapidly swing in either direction,  
  

  
the sliding weight E would at once move  
forward in the same direction that the pendulum  
had moved, and thus counteract, for the instant  
only, the swing, when it would again drop back  
into its central position.  
  
</p><p>With such an arrangement, the pendulum would  
hang vertically at all times, and the pointer below,  
being in range of a circle with degrees indicated  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0179" n="156"/>    
thereon, and the base attached to the  
frame of the machine, can always be observed,  
and the conditions noted at the time the changes  
take place.  
  
</p><p>PENDULUM STABILIZER.&mdash;In many respects the  
use of a pendulum has advantages over the gyroscope.  
The latter requires power to keep it in  
motion. The pendulum is always in condition  
for service. While it may be more difficult to  
adjust the pendulum, so that it does not affect  
  

  
the planes by too rapid a swing, or an oscillation  
which is beyond the true angle desired, still, these  
are matters which, in time, will make the pendulum  
a strong factor in lateral stability.  
  
</p><p>It is an exceedingly simple matter to attach the  
lead wires from an aileron to the pendulum. In  
Fig. 67 one plan is illustrated. The pendulum  
A swings from the frame B of the machine, the  
ailerons a being in this case also shown at right  
angles to their true positions.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0180" n="157"/>    
  
</p><p>The other, Fig. 68, assumes that the machine is  
exactly horizontal, and as the pendulum is in a  
vertical position, the forward edges of both ailerons  
are elevated, but when the pendulum swings  
both ailerons will be swung with their forward  
margins up or down in unison, and thus the proper  
angles are made to right the machine.  
  
</p><p>STEERING AND CONTROLLING WHEEL.&mdash;For the  
purpose of concentrating the control in a single  
wheel, which has not alone a turning motion, but  
  

  
is also mounted in such a manner that it will oscillate  
to and fro, is very desirable, and is adapted  
for any kind of machine.  
  
</p><p>Fig. 69 shows such a structure, in which A  
represents the frame of the machine, and B a  
segment for the stem of the wheel, the segment  
being made of two parts, so as to form a guideway  
for the stem a to travel between, and the segment  
is placed so that the stem will travel in a  
fore and aft direction.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0181" n="158"/>    
  
</p><p>The lower end of the stem is mounted in a  
socket, at D, so that while it may be turned, it  
will also permit this oscillating motion. Near its  
lower end is a cross bar E from which the wires  
run to the vertical control plane, and also to the  
ailerons, if the machine is equipped with them, or  
to the warping ends of the planes.  
  

  
</p><p>Above the cross arms is a loose collar F to  
which the fore and aft cords are attached that go  
to the elevators, or horizontal planes. The upper  
end of the stem has a wheel G, which may also be  
equipped with the throttle and spark levers.  
  
</p><p>AUTOMATIC STABILIZING WINGS.&mdash;Unquestionably,  
the best stabilizer is one which will act on  
its own initiative. The difficulty with automatic  
devices is, that they act too late, as a general  
thing, to be effective. The device represented in  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0182" n="159"/>    
Fig. 70 is very simple, and in practice is found to  
be most efficient.  
  
</p><p>In this Fig. 70 A and B represent the upper  
and the lower planes, respectively. Near the end  
  

  
vertical standards a, D, are narrow wings E E,  
F F, hinged on a fore and aft line close below  
each of the planes, the wings being at such distances  
from the standards C D that when they  
swing outwardly they will touch the standards,  
  

  
and when in that position will be at an angle of  
about 35 degrees from the planes A B.  
  
</p><p>Inwardly they are permitted to swing up and  
lie parallel with the planes, as shown in Fig. 71  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0183" n="160"/>    
where the planes are at an angle. In turning, all  
machines skid,&mdash;that is they travel obliquely  
across the field, and this is also true when the  
ship is sailing at right angles to the course of the  
wind.  
  
</p><p>This will be made clear by reference to Fig.  
72, in which the dart A represents the direction  
of the movement of the aeroplane, and B the direction  
  

  
of the wind, the vertical rudder a being  
almost at right angles to the course of the wind.  
  
</p><p>In turning a circle the same thing takes place  
as shown in Fig. 73, with the tail at a different  
angle, so as to give a turning movement to the  
plane. It will be seen that in the circling movement  
the tendency of the aeroplane is to fly out  
at a tangent, shown by the line D, so that the  
planes of the machine are not radially-disposed  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0184" n="161"/>    
with reference to the center of the circle, the line  
E showing the true radial line.  
  
</p><p>Referring now to Fig. 71, it will be seen that  
this skidding motion of the machine swings the  
wings E F inwardly, so that they offer no resistance  
to the oblique movement, but the wings E  
E, at the other end of the planes are swung outwardly,  
to provide an angle, which tends to raise  
  

  
up the inner end of the planes, and thereby seek  
to keep the planes horizontal.  
  
</p><p>BAROMETERS.&mdash;These instruments are used for  
registering heights. A barometer is a device for  
measuring the weight or pressure of the air.  
The air is supposed to extend to a height of 40  
miles from the surface of the sea. A column of  
air one inch square, and forty miles high, weighs  
the same as a column of mercury one inch square  
and 30 inches high  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0185" n="162"/>    
  
</p><p>Such a column of air, or of mercury, weighs  
14 3/4 pounds. If the air column should be  
weighed at the top of the mountain, that part  
above would weigh less than if measured at the  
sea level, hence, as we ascend or descend the pressure  
becomes less or more, dependent on the altitude.  
  
</p><p>Mercury is also used to indicate temperature,  
but this is brought about by the expansive quality  
of the mercury, and not by its weight.  
  

  
</p><p>ANEROID BAROMETER.&mdash;The term   
<hi rend="italic">Aneroid</hi> barometer  
is frequently used in connection with air-ship experiments. The word aneroid means not  
  
<hi rend="italic">wet</hi>, or not a   
<hi rend="italic">fluid</hi>, like mercury, so that, while  
aneroid barometers are being made which do use  
mercury, they are generally made without.  
  
</p><p>One such form is illustrated in Fig. 74, which  
represents a cylindrical shell A, which has at each  
end a head of concentrically formed corrugations.  
These heads are securely fixed to the ends of the  
shell A. Within, one of the disk heads has a  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0186" n="163"/>    
short stem C, which is attached to the short end  
of a lever D, this lever being pivoted at E. The  
outer end of this lever is hinged to the short end  
of another lever F, and so by compounding the  
levers, it will be seen that a very slight movement  
of the head B will cause a considerable movement  
in the long end of the lever F.  
  
</p><p>This end of the lever F connects with one limb  
of a bell-crank lever G, and its other limb has a  
toothed rack connection with a gear H, which  
turns the shaft to which the pointer I is attached.  
  
</p><p>Air is withdrawn from the interior of the shell,  
so that any change in the pressure, or weight of  
the atmosphere, is at once felt by the disk heads,  
and the finger turns to indicate the amount of  
pressure.  
  
</p><p>HYDROPLANES.&mdash;Hydro means water, hence the  
term hydroplane has been given to machines  
which have suitable pontoons or boats, so they  
may alight or initiate flight from water.  
  
</p><p>There is no particular form which has been  
adopted to attach to aeroplanes, the object generally  
being to so make them that they will sustain  
the greatest amount of weight with the least  
submergence, and also offer the least resistance  
while the motor is drawing the machine along the  
surface of the water, preparatory to launching it.  
  
</p><p>SUSTAINING WEIGHT OF PONTOONS.&mdash;A pontoon  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0187" n="164"/>    
having within nothing but air, is merely a measuring  
device which determines the difference between  
the weight of water and the amount placed  
on the pontoon. Water weighs 62&frac12; pounds per  
cubic foot. Ordinary wood, an average of 32  
pounds, and steel 500 pounds.  
  
</p><p>It is, therefore, an easy matter to determine  
how much of solid matter will be sustained by a  
pontoon of a given size, or what the dimensions  
of a pontoon should be to hold up an aeroplane  
which weighs, with the pilot, say, 1100 pounds.  
  
</p><p>As we must calculate for a sufficient excess to  
prevent the pontoons from being too much immersed,  
and also allow a sufficient difference in  
weight so that they will keep on the surface when  
the aeroplane strikes the surface in alighting, we  
will take the figure of 1500 pounds to make the  
calculations from.  
  
</p><p>If this figure is divided by 62&frac12; we shall find  
the cubical contents of the pontoons, not considering,  
of course, the weight of the material of which  
they are composed. This calculation shows that  
we must have 24 cubic feet in the pontoons.  
  
</p><p>As there should be two main pontoons, and a  
smaller one for the rear, each of the main ones  
might have ten cubic feet, and the smaller one  
four cubic feet.  
  
</p><p>SHAPES OF THE PONTOONS.&mdash;We are now ready  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0188" n="165"/>    
to design the shapes. Fig. 75 shows three general  
types, A being made rectangular in form,  
with a tapering forward end, so constructed as to  
ride up on the water.  
  
</p><p>The type B has a rounded under body, the forward  
end being also skiff-shaped to decrease as  
much as possible the resistance of the water impact.  
  

  
</p><p>The third type C is made in the form of a  
closed boat, with both ends pointed, and the bottom  
rounded, or provided with a keel. Or, as in  
some cases the body may be made triangular in  
cross section so that as it is submerged its sustaining  
weight will increase at a greater degree  
as it is pressed down than its vertical measurement  
indicates.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0189" n="166"/>    
  
</p><p>All this, however, is a matter left to the judgment  
of the designer, and is, in a great degree,  
dependent on the character of the craft to which  
it is to be applied.</p>

EXPERIMENTAL WORK IN FLYING</head>  
  
<p>THE novice about to take his first trial trip in  
an automobile will soon learn that the great task  
in his mind is to properly start the machine. He  
is conscious of one thing, that it will be an easy  
matter to stop it by cutting off the fuel supply  
and applying the brakes.  
  
</p><p>CERTAIN CONDITIONS IN FLYING.&mdash;In an aeroplane  
conditions are reversed. Shutting off the  
fuel supply and applying the brakes only bring  
on the main difficulty. He must learn to stop the  
machine after all this is done, and this is the  
great test of flying. It is not the launching,&mdash;the ability to get into the air, but the landing, that  
gives the pupil his first shock.  
  
</p><p>Man is so accustomed to the little swirls of air  
all about him, that he does not appreciate what  
they mean to a machine which is once free to  
glide along in the little currents which are so unnoticeable  
to him as a pedestrian.  
  
</p><p>The contour of the earth, the fences, trees, little  
elevations and other natural surroundings, all  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0191" n="168"/>    
have their effect on a slight moving air current,  
and these inequalities affect the air and disturb  
it to a still greater extent as the wind increases.  
Even in a still air, with the sun shining, there are  
air eddies, caused by the uneven heating of the  
air in space.  
  
</p><p>HEAT IN AIR.&mdash;Heat is transmitted through the  
air by what is called   
<hi rend="italic">convection</hi>, that is, the particles  
of the air transmit it from one point to the  
next. If a room is closed up tight, and a little  
aperture provided so as to let in a streak of sunlight,  
it will give some idea of the unrest of the  
atmosphere. This may be exhibited by smoke  
along the line of the sun's rays, which indicates  
that the particles of air are constantly in motion,  
although there may be absolutely nothing in the  
room to disturb it.  
  
</p><p>MOTION WHEN IN FLIGHT.&mdash;If you can imagine  
a small airship floating in that space, you can  
readily conceive that it will be hurled hither and  
thither by the motion which is thus apparent to  
the eye.  
  
</p><p>This motion is greatly accentuated by the surface  
of the earth, independently of its uneven contour.  
If a ball is thrown through the air, its  
dynamic force is measured by its impact. So  
with light, and heat. In the space between the  
planets it is very cold. The sunlight, or the rays  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0192" n="169"/>    
from the sun are there, just the same as on the  
earth.  
  
</p><p>Unless the rays come into contact with something,  
they produce no effect. When the beams  
from the sun come into contact with the atmosphere  
a dynamic force is exerted, just the same  
as when the ball struck an object. When the rays  
reach the earth, reflection takes place, and these  
reflected beams act on the air under different conditions.  
  
</p><p>CHANGING ATMOSPHERE.&mdash;If the air is full of  
moisture, as it may be at some places, while  
comparatively dry at other points, the reflection  
throughout the moist area is much greater than in  
the dry places, hence evaporation will take place  
and whenever a liquid vaporizes it means heat.  
  
</p><p>On the other hand, when the vapor is turning  
to a liquid, condensation takes place, and that  
means cooling. If the air should be of the same  
degree of saturation throughout,&mdash;that is, have  
the same amount of moisture everywhere, there  
would be few winds. These remarks apply to  
conditions which exist over low altitudes all over  
the earth.  
  
</p><p>But at high altitudes the conditions are entirely  
different. As we ascend the air becomes rarer.  
It has less moisture, because a wet atmosphere,  
being heavier, lies nearer the surface of the earth.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0193" n="170"/>    
Being rarer the action of sunlight on the particles  
is less intense. Reflection and refraction of the  
rays acting on the light atmosphere do not produce  
such a powerful effect as on the air near the  
ground.  
  
</p><p>All these conditions&mdash;the contour of the earth;  
the uneven character of the moisture in the air;  
the inequalities of the convection currents; and  
the unstable, tenuous, elastic nature of the atmosphere,  
make the trials of the aviator a hazardous  
one, and it has brought out numerous theories  
connected with bird flight. One of these assumes  
that the bird, by means of its finely organized  
sense, is able to detect rising air currents, and it  
selects them in its flight, and by that means is enabled  
to continue in flight indefinitely, by soaring,  
or by flapping its wings.  
  
</p><p>ASCENDING CURRENTS.&mdash;It has not been explained  
how it happens that these particular "ascending  
currents" always appear directly in the line of  
the bird flight; or why it is that when, for instance,  
a flock of wild geese which always fly through  
space in an A-shaped formation, are able to get  
ascending air currents over the wide scope of space  
they cover.  
  
</p><p>ASPIRATE CURRENTS.&mdash;Some years ago, in making  
experiments with the outstretched wings of  
one of the large soaring birds, a French sailor  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0194" n="171"/>    
was surprised to experience a peculiar pulling motion,  
when the bird's wings were held at a certain  
angle, so that the air actually seemed to draw it  
into the teeth of the current.  
  
</p><p>It is known that if a ball is suspended by a  
string, and a jet of air is directed against it, in  
a particular way, the ball will move toward the  
jet, instead of being driven away from it. A well  
known spraying device, called the "ball nozzle,"  
is simply a ball on the end of a nozzle, and the  
stream of water issuing is not effectual to drive  
the ball away.  
  
</p><p>From the bird incident alluded to, a new theory  
was propounded, namely, that birds flew because  
of the aspirated action of the air, and the wings  
and body were so made as to cause the moving air  
current to act on it, and draw it forwardly.  
  
</p><p>OUTSTRETCHED WINGS.&mdash;This only added to the  
"bird wing" theory a new argument that all flying  
things must have outstretched wings, in order  
to fly, forgetting that the ball, which has no  
outstretched wings, has also the same "aspirate"  
movement attributed to the wings of the bird.  
  
</p><p>The foregoing remarks are made in order to impress  
on the novice that theories do not make  
flying machines, and that speculations, or analogies  
of what we see all about us, will not make an  
aviator. A flying machine is a question of dynamics,  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0195" n="172"/>    
just as surely as the action of the sun on  
the air, and the movements of the currents, and  
the knowledge of applying those forces in the flying  
machine makes the aviator.  
  
</p><p>THE STARTING POINT.&mdash;Before the uninitiated  
should attempt to even mount a machine he should  
know what it is composed of, and how it is made.  
His investigation should take in every part of the  
mechanism; he should understand about the plane  
surface, what the stresses are upon its surface,  
what is the duty of each strut, or brace or wire  
and be able to make the proper repairs.  
  
</p><p>THE VITAL PART OF THE MACHINE.&mdash;The motor,  
the life of the machine itself, should be like a  
book to him. It is not required that he should  
know all the theories which is necessary in the  
building, as to the many features which go to  
make up a scientifically-designed motor; but he  
must know how and why it works. He should understand  
the cam action, whereby the valves are  
lifted at the proper time; what the effect of the  
spark advance means; the throttling of the engine;  
air admission and supply; the regulation  
of the carbureter; its mechanism and construction;  
the propeller should be studied, and its action  
at various speeds.  
  
</p><p>STUDYING THE ACTION OF THE MACHINE.&mdash;Then  
comes the study on the seat of the machine itself.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0196" n="173"/>    
It will be a novel sensation. Before him is the  
steering wheel, if it should be so equipped. Turning  
it to the right, swings the vertical tail plane  
so the machine will turn to the right. Certainly,  
he knows that; but how far must he turn the  
wheel to give it a certain angle.  
  
</p><p>It is not enough to know that a lever or a wheel  
when moved a certain way will move a plane a  
definite direction. He should learn to know  
instinctively, how   
<hi rend="italic">far</hi> a movement to make to get  
a certain result in the plane itself, and under running  
conditions, as well.  
  
</p><p>Suppose we have an automobile, running at the  
rate of ten miles an hour, and the chauffeur turns  
the steering wheel ten degrees. He can do so with  
perfect safety; but let the machine be going forty  
miles an hour, and turn the wheel ten degrees,  
and it may mean an accident. In one case the  
machine is moving 14&frac12; feet a second, and in the  
other instance 58 feet.  
  
</p><p>If the airship has a lever for controlling the  
angle of flight, he must study its arrangement,  
and note how far it must be moved to assume  
the proper elevating angle. Then come the means  
for controlling the lateral stability of the machine.  
All these features should be considered and studied  
over and over, until you have made them your  
friends.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0197" n="174"/>    
  
</p><p>While thus engaged, you are perfectly sure that  
you can remember and act on a set of complicated  
movements. You imagine that you are skimming  
over the ground, and your sense tells you that you  
have sufficient speed to effect a launching. In  
your mind the critical time has come.  
  
</p><p>ELEVATING THE MACHINE.&mdash;Simply give the elevator  
lever the proper angle, sharp and quick and  
up you go. As the machine responds, and you can  
feel the cushioning motion, which follows, as it begins  
to ride the air, you are aware of a sensation  
as though the machine were about to turn over  
to one side; you think of the lateral control at  
once, but in doing so forget that the elevator must  
be changed, or you will go too high.  
  
</p><p>You forget about the earth; you are too busy  
thinking about several things which seem to need  
your attention. Yes, there are a variety of matters  
which will crowd upon you, each of which require  
two things; the first being to get the proper  
lever, and the second, to move it just so far.  
  
</p><p>In the early days of aeroplaning, when accidents  
came thick and fast, the most usual explanation  
which came from the pilot, when he recovered,  
was: "I pushed the lever too far."  
  
</p><p>Hundreds of trial machines were built, when  
man learned that he could fly, and in every instance,  
it is safe to say, the experimenter made the  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0198" n="175"/>    
most strenuous exertion to get up in the air the  
first time the machine was put on the trial ground.  
  
</p><p>It is a wonder that accidents were not recorded  
by the hundreds, instead of by the comparatively  
few that were heard from. It was very discouraging,  
no doubt, that the machines would not fly,  
but that all of them, if they had sufficient power,  
would fly, there can be no doubt.  
  
</p><p>HOW TO PRACTICE.&mdash;Absolute familiarity with  
every part of the machine and conditions is the  
first thing. The machine is brought out, and the  
engine tested, the machine being held in leash  
while this is done. It is then throttled down so  
that the power of the engine will be less than is  
necessary to raise the machine from the ground.  
  
</p><p>THE FIRST STAGE.&mdash;Usually it will require over  
25 miles an hour to raise the machine. The engine  
is set in motion, and now, for the first time a new  
sensation takes possession of you, for the reason  
that you are cut off from communication with  
those around you as absolutely as though they  
were a hundred miles away.  
  
</p><p>This new dependence on yourself is, in itself,  
one of the best teachers you could have, because  
it begins to instill confidence and control. As the  
machine darts forward, going ten or fifteen miles  
an hour, with the din of the engine behind you,  
and feeling the rumbling motion of the wheels  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0199" n="176"/>    
over the uneven surface of the earth, you have the  
sensation of going forty miles an hour.  
  
</p><p>The newness of the first sensation, which is  
always under those conditions very much augmented  
in the mind, wears away as the machine  
goes back and forth. There is only one control  
that requires your care, namely, to keep it on a  
straight course. This is easy work, but you are  
learning to make your control a reflex action,&mdash;to  
do it without exercising a distinct will power.  
  
</p><p>PATIENCE THE MOST DIFFICULT THING.&mdash;If you  
have the patience, as you should, to continue this  
running practice, until you absolutely eliminate  
the right and left control, as a matter of thought,  
occasionally, if the air is still turning the machine,  
and eventually, bringing it back, by turning  
it completely around, while skimming the ground,  
you will be ready for the second stage in the  
trials.  
  
</p><p>THE SECOND STAGE.&mdash;The engine is now arranged  
so that it will barely lift, when running  
at its best. After the engine is at full speed, and  
you are sure the machine is going fast enough,  
the elevator control is turned to point the machine  
in the air. It is a tense moment. You are on the  
alert.  
  
</p><p>The elevator is turned, and the forward end  
changes its relation with the ground before you.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0200" n="177"/>    
There was a slight lift, but your caution induces  
you to return the planes to their normal running  
angle. You try it again. You are now certain  
that the machine made a leap and left the ground.  
This is the exhilarating moment.  
  
</p><p>With a calm air the machine is turned while  
running, by means of the vertical rudders. This  
is an easy matter, because while going at twenty  
miles an hour, the weight of the machine on the  
surface of the ground is less than one-tenth of its  
weight when at rest.  
  
</p><p>Thus the trial spins, half the time in the air,  
in little glides of fifty to a hundred feet, increasing  
in length, give practice,   
<hi rend="italic">practice</hi>, PRACTICE,  
each turn of the field making the sport less exciting  
and fixing the controls more perfectly in the  
mind.  
  
</p><p>THE THIRD STAGE.&mdash;Thus far you have been  
turning on the ground. You want to turn in the  
air. Only the tail control was required while on  
the ground. Now two things are required after  
you leave the ground in trying to make a turn:  
namely, putting the tail at the proper angle, and  
taking charge of the stabilizers, because in making  
the turn in the air, the first thing which will  
arrest the attention will be the tendency of the  
machine to turn over in the direction that you are  
turning.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0201" n="178"/>    
  
</p><p>After going back and forth in straight-away  
glides, until you have perfect confidence and full  
control, comes the period when the turns should  
be practiced on. These should be long, and tried  
only on that portion of the field where you have  
plenty of room.  
  
</p><p>OBSERVATIONS WHILE IN FLIGHT.&mdash;If there are  
any bad spots, or trees, or dangerous places, they  
should be spotted out, and mentally noted before  
attempting to make any flight. When in the air  
during these trials you will have enough to occupy  
your mind without looking out for the hazardous  
regions at the same time.  
  
</p><p>Make the first turns in a still air. If you should  
attempt to make the first attempts with a wind  
blowing you will find a compound motion that will  
very likely give you a surprise. In making the  
first turn you will get the sensation of trying to  
fly against a wind. Assuming that you are turning  
to the left, it will have the sensation of a wind  
coming to you from the right.  
  
</p><p>FLYING IN A WIND.&mdash;Suppose you are flying directly  
in the face of a wind, the moment you begin  
to turn the action, or bite of the wind, will cause  
the ends of the planes to the right to be unduly  
elevated, much more so than if the air should be  
calm. This raising action will be liable to startle  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0202"  n="179"/>    
you, because up to this time you have been accustomed  
to flying along in a straight line.  
  
</p><p>While flying around at the part of the circle  
where the wind strikes you directly on the right  
side the machine has a tendency to climb, and you  
try to depress the forward end, but as soon as you  
reach that part of the circle where the winds begin  
to strike on your back, an entirely new thing  
occurs.  
  
</p><p>As the machine is now traveling with the wind,  
its grip on the air is less, and since the planes were  
set to lower the machine, at the first part of the  
turn, the descent will be pretty rapid unless the  
angle is corrected.  
  
</p><p>FIRST TRIALS IN QUIET ATMOSPHERE.&mdash;All this  
would be avoided if the first trials were made in  
a quiet atmosphere. Furthermore, you will be  
told that in making a turn the machine should be  
pointed downwardly, as though about to make a  
glide. This can be done with safety, in a still  
air, although you may be flying low, but it would  
be exceedingly dangerous with a wind blowing.  
  
</p><p>MAKING TURNS.&mdash;When making a turn, under no  
circumstances try to make a landing. This  
should never be done except when flying straight,  
and then safety demands that the landing should  
be made against the wind and not with it. There  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0203" n="180"/>    
are two reasons for this: First, when flying with  
the wind the speed must be greater than when flying  
against it.  
  
</p><p>By greater speed is meant relative to the earth.  
If the machine has a speed of thirty miles an hour,  
in still air, the speed would be forty miles an hour  
going with the wind, but only twenty miles against  
the wind. Second, the banking of the planes  
against the air is more effective when going into  
the wind than when traveling with it, and, therefore,  
the speed at which you contact with the earth  
is lessened to such an extent that a comparatively  
easy landing is effected.  
  
</p><p>THE FOURTH STAGE.&mdash;After sufficient time has  
been devoted to the long turns shorter turns may  
be made, and these also require the same care,  
and will give an opportunity to use the lateral  
controls to a greater extent. Begin the turns, not  
by an abrupt throw of the turning rudder, but  
bring it around gently, correcting the turning  
movement to a straight course, if you find the  
machine inclined to tilt too much, until you get used  
to the sensation of keeling over. Constant practice  
at this will soon give confidence, and assure  
you that you have full control of the machine.  
  
</p><p>THE FIGURE 8.&mdash;You are now to increase the  
height of flying, and this involves also the ability  
to turn in the opposite direction, so that you may  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0204" n="181"/>    
be able to experience the sensation of using the  
stabilizers in the opposite direction. You will  
find in this practice that the senses must take in  
the course of the wind from two quarters now, as  
you attempt to describe the figure 8.  
  
</p><p>This is a test which is required in order to obtain  
a pilot's license. It means that you shall  
be able to show the ability to turn in either direction  
with equal facility. To keep an even flying  
altitude while describing this figure in a wind, is  
the severest test that can be exacted.  
  
</p><p>THE VOLPLANE.&mdash;This is the technical term for  
a <hi rend="italic">glide</hi>. Many accidents have been recorded owing  
to the stopping of the motor, which in the  
past might have been avoided if the character of  
the glide had been understood. The only thing  
that now troubles the pilot when the engine "goes  
dead," is to select a landing place.  
  
</p><p>The proper course in such a case is to urge  
the machine to descend as rapidly as possible, in  
order to get a headway, for the time being. As  
there is now no propelling force the glide is depended  
upon to act as a substitute. The experienced  
pilot will not make a straight-away glide,  
but like the vulture, or the condor, and birds of  
that class, soar in a circle, and thus, by passing  
over and over the same surfaces of the earth, enable  
him to select a proper landing place.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0205" n="182"/>    
  
</p><p>THE LANDING.&mdash;The pilot who can make a good  
landing is generally a good flyer. It requires  
nicety of judgment to come down properly. One  
thing which will appear novel after the first altitude  
flights are attempted is the peculiar sensation  
of the apparently increased speed as the earth  
comes close up to the machine.  
  
</p><p>At a height of one hundred feet, flying thirty  
miles an hour, does not seem fast, because the surface  
of the earth is such a distance away that particular  
objects remain in view for some moments;  
but when within ten feet of the surface the same  
object is in the eye for an instant only.  
  
</p><p>This lends a sort of terror to the novice. He  
imagines a great many things, but forgets some  
things which are very important to do at this  
time. One is, that the front of the machine must  
be thrown up so as to bank the planes against the  
wind. The next is to shut off the power, which  
is to be done the moment the wheels strike the  
ground, or a little before.  
  
</p><p>Upon his judgment of the time of first touching  
the earth depends the success of safely alighting.  
He may bank too high, and come down on the tail  
with disastrous results. If there is plenty of field  
room it is better to come down at a less angle, or  
even keep the machine at an even keel, and the  
elevator can then depress the tail while running  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0206" n="183"/>    
over the ground, and thus bring the machine to  
rest.  
  
</p><p>Frequently, when about to land the machine  
will rock from side to side. In such a case it is  
far safer to go up into the air than to make the  
land, because, unless the utmost care is exercised,  
one of the wing tips will strike the earth and  
wreck the machine.  
  
</p><p>Another danger point is losing headway, as the  
earth is neared, due to flying at too flat an angle,  
or against a wind that happens to be blowing particularly  
hard at the landing place. If the motor  
is still going this does not make so much difference,  
but in a volplane it means that the descent  
must be so steep, at the last moment of flight, that  
the chassis is liable to be crushed by the impact.  
  
</p><p>FLYING ALTITUDE.&mdash;It is doubtful whether the  
disturbed condition of the atmosphere, due to  
the contour of the earth's surface, reaches higher  
than 500 feet. Over a level area it is certain that  
it is much less, but in some sections of the country,  
where the hill ranges extend for many miles,  
at altitudes of three and four hundred feet, the  
upper atmosphere may be affected for a thousand  
feet above.  
  
</p><p>Prof. Lowe, in making a flight with a balloon,  
from Cincinnati to North Carolina, which lasted  
a day and all of one night, found that during the  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0207" n="184"/>    
early morning the balloon, for some reason, began  
to ascend, and climbed nearly five thousand  
feet in a few hours, and as unaccountably  
began to descend several hours before he landed.  
  
</p><p>Before it began to ascend, he was on the western  
side of the great mountain range which extends  
south from Pennsylvania and terminates in  
Georgia. He was actually climbing the mountain  
in a drift of air which was moving eastwardly,  
and at no time was he within four thousand feet  
of the earth during that period, which shows that  
air movements are of such a character as to exert  
their influence vertically to great heights.  
  
</p><p>For cross country flying the safest altitude is  
1000 feet, a distance which gives ample opportunity  
to volplane, if necessary, and it is a height  
which enables the pilot to make observations of the  
surface so as to be able to judge of its character.  
  
</p><p>But explanations and statements, and the experiences  
of pilots might be detailed in pages, and  
still it would be ineffectual to teach the art of flying.  
The only sure course is to do the work on  
an actual machine.  
  
</p><p>Many of the experiences are valuable to the  
learner, some are merely in the nature of cautions,  
and it is advisable for the beginner to learn what  
the experiences of others have been, although they  
may never be called upon to duplicate them.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0208" n="185"/>    
  
</p><p>All agree that at great elevations the flying  
conditions are entirely different from those met  
with near the surface of the ground, and the history  
of accidents show that in every case where  
a mishap was had at high altitude it came about  
through defect in the machine, and not from gusts  
or bad air condition.  
  
</p><p>On the other hand, the uptilting of machines,  
the accidents due to the so-called "Holes in the  
air," which have dotted the historic pages with  
accidents, were brought about at low altitudes.  
  
</p><p>At from two to five thousand feet the air may be  
moving at speeds of from twenty to forty miles  
an hour,&mdash;great masses of winds, like the trade  
stream, which are uniform over vast areas. To  
the aviator flying in such a field, with the earth  
hidden from him, there would be no wind to indicate  
that he was moving in any particular direction.  
  
</p><p>He would fly in that medium, in any direction,  
without the slightest sense that he was in a gale.  
It would not affect the control of the machine,  
because the air, though moving as a mass, would  
be the same as flying in still air. It is only when  
he sees fixed objects that he is conscious of the  
movement of the wind.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII<lb/>  
THE PROPELLER</head>  
  
<p>BY far the most difficult problem connected  
with aviation is the propeller. It is the one great  
vital element in the science and art pertaining to  
this subject which has not advanced in the slightest  
degree since the first machine was launched.  
  
</p><p>The engine has come in for a far greater share  
of expert experimental work, and has advanced  
most rapidly during the past ten years. But,  
strange to say, the propeller is, essentially, the  
same with the exception of a few small changes.  
  
</p><p>PROPELLER CHANGES.&mdash;The changes which have  
been made pertaining to the form of structure,  
principally, and in the use of new materials. The  
kind of wood most suitable has been discovered,  
but the lines are the same, and nothing has been  
done to fill the requirement which grows out of  
the difference in speed when a machine is in the  
act of launching and when it is in full flight.  
  
</p><p>PROPELLER SHAPE.&mdash;It cannot be possible that  
the present shape of the propeller will be its ultimate  
form. It is inconceivable that the propeller  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0210" n="187"/>    
is so inefficient that only one sixty-fifth of the  
power of the engine is available. The improvement  
in propeller efficiency is a direction which  
calls for experimental work on the part of inventors  
everywhere.  
  
</p><p>The making of a propeller, although it appears  
a difficult task, is not as complicated as would appear,  
and with the object in view of making the  
subject readily understood, an explanation will be  
given of the terms "Diameter," and "Pitch," as  
used in the art.  
  
</p><p><hi rend="italic">The Diameter</hi> has reference to the length of  
the propeller, from end to end. In calculating  
propeller pull, the diameter is that which indicates  
the speed of travel, and for this reason is  
a necessary element.  
  
</p><p>Thus, for instance, a propeller three feet in  
diameter, rotating 500 times a minute, has a tip  
speed of 1500 feet, whereas a six foot propeller,  
rotating at the same speed, moves 3000 feet at the  
tips.  
  
</p><p>PITCH.&mdash;This is the term which is most confusing,  
and is that which causes the most frequent  
trouble in the mind of the novice. The term will  
be made clear by carefully examining the accompanying  
illustration and the following description:  
  
</p><p>In Fig. 76 is shown a side view of a propeller  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0211" n="188"/>    
A, mounted on a shaft B, which is free to move  
longitudinally. Suppose we turn the shaft so the  
tip will move along on the line indicated by the  
arrow C.  
  
</p><p>Now the pitch of the blade at D is such that it  
will be exactly in line with the spirally-formed  
  

  
course E, for one complete turn. As the propeller  
shaft has now advanced, along the line E, and  
stopped after one turn, at F, the measure between  
the points F and G represents the pitch of the propeller.  
Another way to express it would be to  
call the angle of the blade a five, or six, or a seven  
foot pitch, as the pitches are measured in feet.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0212" n="189"/>    
  
</p><p>In the illustration thus given the propeller shaft,  
having advanced six feet, we have what is called  
a six foot pitch.  
  
</p><p>Now, to lay out such a pitch is an easy matter.  
Assume, as in Fig. 77, that A represents the end  
of the blank from which the propeller is to be cut,  
and that the diameter of this blank, or its length  
from end to end is seven feet. The problem now  
is to cut the blades at such an angle that we shall  
have a six foot pitch.  
  

  
</p><p>LAYING OUT THE PITCH.&mdash;First, we must get the  
circumference of the propeller, that is, the distance  
the tip of the propeller will travel in making  
one complete turn. This is done by multiplying  
7 by 3.1416. This equals 21.99, or, practically, 22  
feet.  
  
</p><p>A line B is drawn, extending out horizontally  
along one side of the blank A, this line being made  
on a scale, to represent 22 feet. Secondly, at the  
end of this line drawn a perpendicular line C, 6  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0213" n="190"/>    
feet long. A perpendicular line is always one  
which is at right angles to a base line. In this  
case B is the base line.  
  
</p><p>Line C is made 6 feet long, because we are trying  
to find the angle of a 6 foot pitch. If, now, a  
line D is drawn from the ends of the two lines B,  
C, it will represent the pitch which, marked across  
the end of the blank A, will indicate the line to cut  
the blade.  
  
</p><p>PITCH RULE.&mdash;The rule may, therefore, be  
stated as follows: Multiply the diameter (in  
feet) of the propeller by 3.1416, and draw a line  
the length indicated by the product. At one end  
of this line draw a perpendicular line the length  
of the pitch requirement (in feet), and join the  
ends of the two lines by a diagonal line, and this  
line will represent the pitch angle.  
  
</p><p>Propellers may be made of wood or metal, the  
former being preferred for the reason that this  
material makes a lighter article, and is stronger,  
in some respects, than any metal yet suggested.  
  
</p><p>LAMINATED CONSTRUCTION.&mdash;All propellers  
should be laminated,&mdash;that is, built up of layers  
of wood, glued together and thoroughly dried,  
from which the propeller is cut.  
  
</p><p>A product thus made is much more serviceable  
than if made of one piece, even though the laminated  
parts are of the same wood, because the  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0214" n="191"/>    
different strips used will have their fibers overlapping  
each other, and thus greatly augment the  
strength of the whole.  
  
</p><p>Generally the alternate strips are of different  
materials, black walnut, mahogany, birch, spruce,  
and maple being the most largely used, but mahogany  
and birch seem to be mostly favored.  
  
</p><p>LAYING UP A PROPELLER FORM.&mdash;The first step  
necessary is to prepare thin strips, each, say,  
seven feet long, and five inches wide, and three-eighths of an inch thick. If seven such pieces are  
  

  
put together, as in Fig. 78, it will make an assemblage  
of two and five-eighth inches high.  
  
</p><p>Bore a hole centrally through the assemblage,  
and place therein a pin B. The contact faces of  
these strips should be previously well painted  
over with hot glue liberally applied. When they  
are then placed in position and the pin is in place,  
the ends of the separate pieces are offset, one beyond  
the other, a half inch, as shown, for instance,  
in Fig. 79.  
  
</p><p>This will provide ends which are eight and a  
half inches broad, and thus furnish sufficient material  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0215" n="192"/>    
for the blades. The mass is then subjected  
to heavy pressure, and allowed to dry before the  
blades are pared down.  
  

  
</p><p>MAKING WIDE BLADES.&mdash;If a wider blade is desired,  
a greater number of steps may be made by  
adding the requisite number of strips; or, the  
strips may be made thicker. In many propellers,  
not to exceed four different strips are thus glued  
together. The number is optional with the  
maker.  
  
</p><p>An end view of such an assemblage of strips  
is illustrated in Fig. 80. The next step is to lay  
  

  
off the pitch, the method of obtaining which has  
been explained.  
  
</p><p>Before starting work the sides, as well as the  
ends, should be marked, and care observed to  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0216" n="193"/>    
place a distinctive mark on the front side of the  
propeller.  
  
</p><p>Around the pin B, Fig. 81, make S-shaped  
marks C, to indicate where the cuts on the faces  
  

  
of the blades are to begin. Then on the ends of  
the block; scribe the pitch angle, which is indicated  
by the diagonal line D, Fig. 80.  
  
</p><p>This line is on the rear side of the propeller,  
and is perfectly straight. Along the front of this  
line is a bowline E, which indicates the front surface  
of the propeller blade.  
  
</p><p>PROPELLER OUTLINE.&mdash;While the marks thus  
  

  
given show the angles, and are designed to indicate  
the two faces of the blades, there is still another  
important element to be considered, and  
that is the final outline of the blades.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0217" n="194"/>    
  
</p><p>It is obvious that the outline may be varied  
so that the entire width at 1, Fig. 82, may be used,  
or it may have an outline, as represented by the  
line 2, in this figure, so that the widest part will  
be at or near the dotted line 3, say two-thirds of  
the distance from the center of the blade.  
  
</p><p>This is the practice with most of the manufacturers  
at the present time, and some of them  
claim that this form produces the best results.  
  
</p><p>FOR HIGHER SPEEDS.&mdash;Fig. 83 shows a propeller  
cut from a blank, 4" x 6" in cross section, not  
laminated.  
  

  
</p><p>It should be borne in mind that for high speeds  
the blades must be narrow. A propeller seven  
feet in diameter with a six foot pitch, turning  
950 revolutions per minute, will produce a pull of  
350 pounds, if properly made.  
  
</p><p>Such a propeller can be readily handled by a  
forty horse power motor, such as are specially  
constructed for flying machine purposes.  
  
</p><p>INCREASING PROPELLER EFFICIENCY.&mdash;Some experiments  
have been made lately, which, it is  
claimed, largely increase the efficiency of propellers.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0218" n="195"/>    
The improvement is directed to the outline  
shape of the blade.  
  
</p><p>The typical propeller, such as we have illustrated,  
is one with the wide part of the blade at  
the extremity. The new type, as suggested, reverses  
this, and makes the wide part of the blade  
near the hub, so that it gradually tapers down to  
a narrow tip.  
  
</p><p>Such a form of construction is shown in Fig.  
84. This outline has some advantages from one  
  

  
standpoint, namely, that it utilizes that part of  
the blade near the hub, to produce a pull, and  
does not relegate all the duty to the extreme ends  
or tips.  
  
</p><p>To understand this more fully, let us take a  
propeller six feet in diameter, and measure the  
pull or thrust at the tips, and also at a point half  
way between the tip and the hub.  
  
</p><p>In such a propeller, if the blade is the same  
width and pitch at the two points named, the pull  
at the tips will be four times greater than at the  
intermediate point.</p>

EXPERIMENTAL GLIDERS AND MODEL AEROPLANES</head>  
  
<p>AN amusing and very instructive pastime is  
afforded by constructing and flying gliding machines,  
and operating model aeroplanes, the latter  
being equipped with their own power.  
  
</p><p>Abroad this work has been very successful as  
a means of interesting boys, and, indeed, men  
who have taken up the science of aviation are  
giving this sport serious thought and study.  
  
</p><p>When a machine of small dimensions is made  
the boy wonders why a large machine does not  
bear the same relation in weight as a small machine.  
This is one of the first lessons to learn.  
  
</p><p>THE RELATION OF MODELS TO FLYING MACHINES.&mdash;A model aeroplane, say two feet in length, which  
has, we will assume, 50 square inches of supporting  
surface, seems to be a very rigid structure,  
in proportion to its weight. It may be dropped  
from a considerable height without injuring it,  
since the weight is only between two and three  
ounces.  
  
</p><p>An aeroplane twenty times the length of this  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0220" n="197"/>    
model, however strongly it may be made, if  
dropped the same distance, would be crushed, and  
probably broken into fragments.  
  
</p><p>If the large machine is twenty times the dimensions  
of the small one, it would be forty feet in  
length, and, proportionally, would have only  
seven square feet of sustaining surface. But an  
operative machine of that size, to be at all rigid,  
would require more than twenty times the material  
in weight to be equal in strength.  
  
</p><p>It would weigh about 800 pounds, that is, 4800  
times the weight of the model, and instead of  
having twenty times the plane surface would require  
one thousand times the spread.  
  
</p><p>It is this peculiarity between models and the  
actual flyers that for years made the question of  
flying a problem which, on the basis of pure calculation  
alone, seemed to offer a negative; and  
many scientific men declared that practical flying  
was an impossibility.  
  
</p><p>LESSONS FROM MODELS.&mdash;Men, and boys, too,  
can learn a useful lesson from the model aeroplanes  
in other directions, however, and the principal  
thing is the one of stability.  
  
</p><p>When everything is considered the form or  
shape of a flying model will serve to make a large  
flyer. The manner of balancing one will be a  
good criterion for the other in practice, and experimenting  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0221" n="198"/>    
with these small devices is, therefore,  
most instructive.  
  
</p><p>The difference between gliders and model aeroplanes  
is, that gliders must be made much lighter  
because they are designed to be projected through  
the air by a kick of some kind.  
  
</p><p>FLYING MODEL AEROPLANES.&mdash;Model aeroplanes  
contain their own power and propellers which,  
while they may run for a few seconds only, serve  
the purpose of indicating how the propeller will  
act, and in what respect the sustaining surfaces  
are efficient and properly arranged.  
  
</p><p>It is not our purpose to give a treatise on this  
subject but to confine this chapter to an exposition  
of a few of the gliders and model forms which  
are found to be most efficient for experimental  
work.  
  
</p><p>AN EFFICIENT GLIDER.&mdash;Probably the simplest  
and most efficient glider, and one which can be  
made in a few moments, is to make a copy of the  
deltoid kite, previously referred to.  
  
</p><p>This is merely a triangularly-shaped piece of  
paper, or stiff cardboard A, Fig. 84, creased in  
the middle, along the dotted line B, the side wings  
C, C, being bent up so as to form, what are called  
diedral angles. This may be shot through the  
air by a flick of the finger, with the pointed end  
foremost, when used as a glider.  
  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0222" n="199"/>    
  

  
</p><p>THE DELTOID FORMATION.&mdash;This same form may  
be advantageously used as a model aeroplane, but  
in that case the broad end should be foremost.  
  

  
</p><p>Fig. 86 shows the deltoid glider, or aeroplane,  
with three cross braces, A, B, C, in the two forward  
braces of which are journaled the propeller  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0223" n="200"/>    
shaft D, so that the propeller E is at the broad  
end of the glider.  
  
</p><p>A short stem F through the rear brace C, provided  
with a crank, has its inner end connected  
with the rear end of the shaft D by a rubber band  
G, by which the propeller is driven.  
  
</p><p>A tail may be attached to the rear end, or at  
the apex of the planes, so it can be set for the  
purpose of directing the angle of flight, but it will  
be found that this form has remarkable stability  
in flight, and will move forwardly in a straight  
line, always making a graceful downward movement  
when the power is exhausted.  
  
</p><p>It seems to be a form which has equal stabilizing  
powers whether at slow or at high speeds,  
thus differing essentially from many forms which  
require a certain speed in order to get the best  
results.  
  
</p><p>RACING MODELS.&mdash;Here and in England many  
racing models have been made, generally of the  
A-shaped type, which will be explained hereinafter.  
Such models are also strong, and able to  
withstand the torsional strain required by the  
rubber which is used for exerting the power.  
  
</p><p>It is unfortunate that there is not some type of  
cheap motor which is light, and adapted to run  
for several minutes, which would be of great value  
in work of this kind, but in the absence of such  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0224" n="201"/>    
mechanism rubber bands are found to be most  
serviceable, giving better results than springs or  
bows, since the latter are both too heavy to be  
available, in proportion to the amount of power  
developed.  
  
</p><p>Unlike the large aeroplanes, the supporting  
surfaces, in the models, are at the rear end of  
the frames, the pointed ends being in front.  
  

  
</p><p>Fig. 87 shows the general design of the A-shaped gliding plane or aeroplane. This is composed  
of main frame pieces A, A, running fore  
and aft, joined at their rear ends by a cross bar  
B, the ends of which project out slightly beyond  
their juncture with the side bars A, A. These  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0225" n="202"/>    
projecting ends have holes drilled therein to receive  
the shafts a, a, of the propeller D, D.  
  
</p><p>A main plane E is mounted transversely across  
this frame at its rear end, while at its forward  
end is a small plane, called the elevator. The  
pointed end of the frame has on each side a turnbuckle  
G, for the purpose of winding up the shaft,  
and thus twisting the propeller, although this is  
usually dispensed with, and the propeller itself  
is turned to give sufficient twist to the rubber for  
this purpose.  
  
</p><p>THE POWER FOR MODEL AEROPLANES.&mdash;One end  
of the rubber is attached to the hook of the shaft  
C, and the other end to the hook or to the turnbuckle  
G, if it should be so equipped.  
  
</p><p>The rubbers are twisted in opposite directions,  
to correspond with the twist of the propeller  
blades, and when the propellers are permitted to  
turn, their grip on the air will cause the model to  
shoot forwardly, until the rubbers are untwisted,  
when the machine will gradually glide to the  
ground.  
  
</p><p>MAKING THE PROPELLER.&mdash;These should have  
the pitch uniform on both ends, and a simple  
little device can be made to hold the twisted blade  
after it has been steamed and bent. Birch and  
holly are good woods for the blades. The strips  
should be made thin and then boiled, or, what is  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0226" n="203"/>    
better still, should be placed in a deep pan, and  
held on a grid above the water, so they will be  
thoroughly steamed.  
  
</p><p>They are then taken out and bent by hand, or  
secured between a form specially prepared for  
the purpose. The device shown in Fig. 88 shows  
a base board which has in the center a pair of  
parallel pins A, A, slightly separated from each  
other.  
  

  
</p><p>At each end of the base board is a pair of holes  
C, D, drilled in at an angle, the angles being the  
pitch desired for the ends of the propeller. In  
one of these holes a pin E is placed, so the pins  
at the opposite ends project in different directions,  
and the tips of the propeller are held  
against the ends of these pins, while the middle  
of the propeller is held between the parallel pins  
A, A.  
  
</p><p>The two holes, at the two angles at the ends of  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0227" n="204"/>    
the board, are for the purpose of making right  
and left hand propellers, as it is desirable to use  
two propellers with the A-shaped model. Two  
propellers with the deltoid model are not so necessary.  
  
</p><p>After the twist is made and the blade properly  
secured in position it should be allowed to thoroughly  
dry, and afterwards, if it is coated with  
shellac, will not untwist, as it is the changing  
character of the atmosphere which usually causes  
the twisted strips to change their positions.  
Shellac prevents the moist atmosphere from affecting  
them.  
  
</p><p>MATERIAL FOR PROPELLERS.&mdash;Very light propellers  
can also be made of thin, annealed aluminum  
sheets, and the pins in that case will serve as  
guides to enable you to get the desired pitch.  
Fiber board may also be used, but this is more  
difficult to handle.  
  
</p><p>Another good material is celluloid sheets,  
which, when cut into proper strips, is dipped in  
hot water, for bending purposes, and it readily  
retains its shape when cooled.  
  
</p><p>RUBBER&mdash;Suitable rubber for the strips are  
readily obtainable in the market. Experiment  
will soon show what size and lengths are best  
adapted for the particular type of propellers  
which you succeed in making.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0228" n="205"/>    
  
</p><p>PROPELLER SHAPE AND SIZE.&mdash;A good proportion  
of propeller is shown in Fig. 89. This also  
shows the form and manner of connecting the  
shaft. The latter A has a hook B on one end to  
which the rubber may be attached, and its other  
end is flattened, as at C, and secured to the blade  
by two-pointed brads D, clinched on the other  
side.  
  
 
  
</p><p>The collar E is soldered on the shaft, and in  
practice the shaft is placed through the bearing  
hole at the end of the frame before the hook is  
bent.  
  
</p><p>SUPPORTING SURFACES.&mdash;The supporting surfaces  
may be made perfectly flat, although in this  
particular it would be well to observe the rules  
with respect to the camber of large machines.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XV<lb/>  
THE AEROPLANE IN THE GREAT WAR</head>  
  
<p>DURING the civil war the Federal forces used  
captive balloons for the purpose of discovering  
the positions of the enemy. They were of great  
service at that time, although they were stationed  
far within the lines to prevent hostile guns from  
reaching them.  
  
</p><p>BALLOON OBSERVATIONS.&mdash;Necessarily, observations  
from balloons were and are imperfect. It  
was found to be very unsatisfactory during the  
Russian-Japanese war, because the angle of vision  
is very low, and, furthermore, at such distances the  
movements, or even the location of troops is not  
observable, except under the most favorable conditions.  
  
</p><p>Balloon observation during the progress of a  
battle is absolutely useless, because the smoke  
from the firing line is, necessarily, between the  
balloon and the enemy, so that the aerial scout  
has no opportunity to make any observations, even  
in detached portions of the fighting zone, which  
are of any value to the commanders.  
  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0230" n="207"/>    
  
</p><p>CHANGED CONDITIONS OF WARFARE.&mdash;Since our  
great war, conditions pertaining to guns have been  
revolutionized. Now the ranges are so great that  
captive balloons would have to be located far in  
the rear, and at such a great distance from the  
firing line that even the best field glasses would  
be useless.  
  
</p><p>The science of war has also evolved another  
condition. Soldiers are no longer exposed during  
artillery attacks. Uniforms are made to imitate  
natural objects. The khaki suits were designed  
to imitate the yellow veldts of South Africa;  
the gray-green garments of the German  
forces are designed to simulate the green fields  
of the north.  
  
</p><p>THE EFFORT TO CONCEAL COMBATANTS.&mdash;The  
French have discarded the historic red trousers,  
and the elimination of lace, white gloves, and  
other telltale insignias of the officers, have been  
dispensed with by special orders.  
  
</p><p>In the great European war armies have burrowed  
in the earth along battle lines hundreds of  
miles in length; made covered trenches; prepared  
artificial groves to conceal batteries, and in many  
ingenious ways endeavored to make the battlefield  
an imitation field of nature.  
  
</p><p>SMOKELESS POWDER.&mdash;While smokeless powder  
has been utilized to still further hide a fighting  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0231" n="208"/>    
force, it has, in a measure, uncovered itself, as  
the battlefield is not now, as in olden times, overspread  
with masses of rolling smoke.  
  
</p><p>Nevertheless, over every battlefield there is a  
haze which can be penetrated only from above,  
hence the possibilities of utilizing the aeroplane  
in war became the most important study with all  
nations, as soon as flying became an accomplished  
fact.  
  
</p><p>INVENTIONS TO ATTACK AERIAL CRAFT.&mdash;Before  
any nation had the opportunity to make an actual  
test on the battlefield, inventors were at work to  
devise a means whereby an aerial foe could be  
met. In a measure the aerial gun has been successful,  
but months of war has shown that the  
aeroplane is one of the strongest arms of the  
service in actual warfare.  
  
</p><p>It was assumed prior to the European war that  
the chief function of the aeroplane would be the  
dropping of bombs,&mdash;that is for service in attacking  
a foe. Actual practice has not justified  
this theory. In some places the appearance of  
the aeroplane has caused terror, but it has been  
found the great value is its scouting advantages.  
  
</p><p>FUNCTION OF THE AEROPLANE IN WAR.&mdash;While  
bomb throwing may in the future be perfected,  
it is not at all an easy problem for an aviator to  
do work which is commensurate with the risk involved.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0232" n="209"/>    
The range is generally too great; the  
necessity of swift movement in the machine too  
speedy to assure accuracy, and to attack a foe at  
haphazard points can never be effectual. Even  
the slowly-moving gas fields, like the Zeppelin,  
cannot deliver bombs with any degree of precision  
or accuracy.  
  
</p><p>BOMB-THROWING TESTS.&mdash;It is interesting, however,  
to understand how an aviator knows where  
or when to drop the bomb from a swiftly-moving  
machine. Several things must be taken into consideration,  
such as the height of the machine from  
the earth; its speed, and the parabolic curve that  
the bomb will take on its flight to the earth.  
  
</p><p>When an object is released from a moving machine  
it will follow the machine from which it is  
dropped, gradually receding from it, as it descends,  
so that the machine is actually beyond  
the place where the bomb strikes the earth, due  
to the retarding motion of the atmosphere against  
the missile.  
  
</p><p>The diagram Fig. 90 will aid the boy in grasping  
the situation. A is the airship; B the path  
of its flight; a the course of the bomb after it  
leaves the airship; and D the earth. The question  
is how to determine the proper movement  
when to release the bomb.  
  
</p><p>METHOD FOR DETERMINING MOVEMENT OF A  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0233" n="210"/>    
BOMB.&mdash;Lieut. Scott, U. S. A., of the Coast Survey  
Artillery, suggested a method for determining  
these questions. It was necessary to ascertain,  
first, the altitude and speed. While the barometer  
is used to determine altitudes, it is  
obvious that speed is a matter much more difficult  
to ascertain, owing to the wind movements,  
which in all cases make it difficult for a flier to  
  

  
determine, even with instruments which have  
been devised for the purpose.  
  
</p><p>Instead, therefore, of relying on the barometer,  
the ship is equipped with a telescope which may  
be instantly set at an angle of 45 degrees, or vertically.  
  
</p><p>Thus, Fig 91 shows a ship A, on which is  
mounted a telescope B, at an angle of 45 degrees.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0234" n="211"/>    
The observer first notes the object along the line  
of 45 degrees, and starts the time of this observation  
by a stop watch.  
  
</p><p>The telescope is then turned so it is vertical,  
as at C, and the observer watches through the  
telescope until the machine passes directly over  
  

  
the object, when the watch is stopped, to indicate  
the time between the two observations.  
  
</p><p>The height of the machine along the line D is  
thus equal to the line E from B to C, and the time  
of the flight from B to a being thus known, as  
well as the height of the machine, the observer  
consults specially-prepared tables which show  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0235" n="212"/>    
just what kind of a curve the bomb will make at  
that height and speed.  
  
</p><p>All that is necessary now is to set the sighter  
of the telescope at the angle given in the tables,  
and when the object to be hit appears at the sight,  
the bomb is dropped.  
  
</p><p>THE GREAT EXTENT OF MODERN BATTLE LINES.&mdash;The great war brought into the field such stupendous  
masses of men that the battle lines have  
extended over an unbroken front of over 200  
miles.  
  
</p><p>In the battle of Waterloo, about 140,000 men  
were engaged on both sides, and the battle front  
was less than six miles. There were, thus massed,  
along the front, over 20,000 men every mile of  
the way, or 10,000 on each side.  
  
</p><p>In the conflict between the Allies and the Germans  
it is estimated that there were less than  
7500 along each mile. It was predicted in the  
earlier stages of the war that it would be an easy  
matter for either side to suddenly mass such an  
overwhelming force at one point as to enable the  
attacking party to go through the opposing force  
like a wedge.  
  
</p><p>Such tactics were often employed by Napoleon  
and other great masters of war; but in every effort  
where it has been attempted in the present  
conflict, it was foiled.  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0236" n="213"/>    
  
</p><p>The opposing force was ready to meet the attack  
with equal or superior numbers. The eye  
of the army, the aeroplane, detected the movements  
in every instance.  
  
</p><p>THE AEROPLANE DETECTING THE MOVEMENTS OF  
ARMIES.&mdash;In the early stages of the war, when  
the Germans drove the left of the French army  
towards Paris, the world expected an investment  
of that city. Suddenly, and for no apparent  
reason, the German right was forced back and  
commenced to retreat.  
  
</p><p>It was not known until weeks afterwards that  
the French had assembled a large army to the  
west and northwest of Paris, ready to take the  
Germans in flank the moment an attempt should  
be made to encircle the Paris forts.  
  
</p><p>The German aviators, flying over Paris, discovered  
the hidden army, and it is well they did  
so, for it is certain if they had surrounded the  
outlying forts, it would have been an easy matter  
for the concealed forces to destroy their communications,  
and probably have forced the surrender  
of a large part of the besiegers.  
  
</p><p>The aeroplane in warfare, therefore, has constantly  
noted every disposition of troops, located  
the positions and judged the destination of convoys;  
the battery emplacements; and the direction  
in which large forces have been moved from  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0237" n="214"/>    
one part of the line to the other, thus keeping the  
commanders so well informed that few surprises  
were possible.  
  
</p><p>THE EFFECTIVE HEIGHT FOR SCOUTING.&mdash;It has  
been shown that aeroplane scouting is not effective  
at high altitudes. It is not difficult for aviators  
to reach and maintain altitudes of five thousand  
feet and over, but at that elevation it is impossible  
to distinguish anything but the movement  
of large forces.  
  
</p><p>SIZES OF OBJECTS AT GREAT DISTANCES.&mdash;At a  
distance of one mile an automobile, twenty feet  
in length, is about as large as a piece of pencil  
one inch long, viewed at a distance of thirty-five  
feet. A company of one hundred men, which in  
marching order, say four abreast, occupies a space  
of eight by one hundred feet, looks to the aviator  
about as large as an object one inch in length, four  
and a half feet from the eye.  
  
</p><p>The march of such a body of men, viewed at  
that distance, is so small as almost to be imperceptible  
to the eye of an observer at rest. How  
much more difficult it is to distinguish a movement  
if the observer is in a rapidly-moving machine.  
  
</p><p>For these reasons observations must be made  
at altitudes of less than a mile, and the hazard  
of these enterprises is, therefore, very great,  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0238" n="215"/>    
since the successful scout must bring himself  
within range of specially designed guns, which  
are effective at a range of 3000 yards or more,  
knowing that his only hope of safety lies in the  
chance that the rapidly-moving machine will avoid  
the rain of bullets that try to seek him out.  
  
</p><p>SOME DARING FEATS IN WAR.&mdash;It would be impossible  
to recount the many remarkable aerial  
fights which have taken place in the great war.  
Some of them seem to be unreal, so startling are  
the tales that have been told. We may well imagine  
the bravery that will nerve men to fight  
thousands of feet above the earth.  
  
</p><p>One of the most thrilling combats took place  
between a Russian aeroplane and a Zeppelin, over  
Russian Poland, at the time of the first German  
invasion. The Zeppelin was soaring over the  
Russian position, at an altitude of about a mile.  
A Russian aviator ascended and after circling  
about, so as to gain a position higher than the  
airship, darted down, and crashed into the great  
gas field.  
  
</p><p>The aviator knew that it meant death to him,  
but his devotion led him to make the sacrifice.  
The Zeppelin, broken in two, and robbed of its  
gas, slowly moved toward the earth, then gradually  
increased the speed of its descent, as the  
aeroplane clung to its shattered hulk, and by the  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0239" n="216"/>    
time it neared the earth its velocity was great  
enough to assure the destruction of all on board,  
while the ship itself was crushed to atoms.  
  
</p><p>One of the most spectacular fights of the war  
occurred outside Paris, when one of the German  
Taubes attempted to make its periodical tour  
of observation. One of the French aeroplanes,  
which had the advantage of greater speed,  
mounted to a greater altitude, and circled about  
the Taube.  
  
</p><p>The latter with its machine gun made a furious  
attack, during these maneuvers, but the French  
ship did not reply until it was at such an elevation  
that it could deliver the attack from above.  
Then its machine gun was brought into play. As  
was afterwards discovered, the wings and body  
of the Taube were completely riddled, and it was  
a marvel how it was possible for the German aviator  
to remain afloat as long as he did.  
  
</p><p>Soon the Taube was noticed to lurch from side  
to side, and then dart downwardly. The monoplane,  
in the pursuit, gradually descended, but it  
was not able to follow the destroyed Taube to the  
earth, as the latter finally turned over, and went  
swirling to destruction.  
  
</p><p>The observer, as well as the aviator, had both  
been killed by the fire from the monoplane.  
  
</p><p>In the trenches on the Marne, to the northeast  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0240" n="217"/>    
of Paris, where the most stubborn conflict raged  
for over a week, the air was never clear of aeroplanes.  
They could be seen in all directions, and  
almost all types of machines were represented.  
The principal ones, however, were monoplanes.  
  
</p><p>THE GERMAN TAUBE.&mdash;The German Taube is a  
monoplane, its main supporting surfaces, as well  
as the tail planes, are so constructed that they  
represent a bird. Taube means dove. It would  
have been more appropriate to call it a hawk.  
  
</p><p>On the other hand, the French monoplane, of  
which the Bleriot is the best known example, has  
wings with well rounded extremities, and flaring  
tail, so that the two can be readily distinguished.  
  
</p><p>On one occasion, during the lull in the battle,  
two of the Taubes approached the area above the  
French lines, and after ascending to a great  
height, began the volplane toward their own lines.  
Such a maneuver was found to be the most advantageous,  
as it gave the scouting aeroplane the  
advantage of being able to discover the positions  
and movements with greater ease, and at the same  
time, in case of accident to the machine, the impetus  
of the flight would be to their own lines.  
  
</p><p>Three of the French aeroplanes at once began  
their circling flight, mounting higher and higher,  
but without attempting to go near the Taubes.  
When the French ships had gained the proper altitude,  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0241" n="218"/>    
they closed in toward the German ships,  
before the latter could reach their own lines in  
their volplaning act.  
  
</p><p>This meant that they must retreat or fight, and  
the crack of the guns showed that it meant a  
struggle. The monoplanes circled about with  
incredible skill, pouring forth shot after shot.  
Soon one of the Taubes was seen to flutter.  
This was the signal for a more concentrated attack  
on her.  
  
</p><p>The army in the trenches, and on the fields below,  
witnessed the novel combat. The flying  
ships were now approaching the earth, but the  
gunners below dared not use their guns, because  
in the maneuvers they would be as likely to strike  
friend as foe.  
  
</p><p>The wounded Taube was now shooting to the  
earth, and the two monoplanes began to give their  
attention to the other ship, which was attempting  
to escape to the north. The flash of the guns of  
all the fliers could be plainly seen, but the sounds  
were drowned by the roar of the great conflict all  
about them.  
  
</p><p>The Taube could not escape the net around her.  
She, too, was doomed. A shot seemed to strike  
the gasoline tank, and the framework was soon  
enveloped in flames. Then she turned sidewise,  
as the material on one side burned away, and skidding  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0242" n="219"/>    
to the left she darted to the earth, a shapeless  
mass.  
  
</p><p>It was found that the aviator was not hurt by  
the shot, but was, undoubtedly, killed by the impact  
with the earth. The observer was riddled  
with bullets, and was likely dead before the ship  
reached the earth.  
  
</p><p>In the western confines of Belgium, near Ypres,  
the British employed numerous aircraft, many of  
them biplanes, and at all times they were in the  
air, reporting observations. Many of the flying  
fights have been recorded, and the reports when  
published will be most thrilling reading.  
  
</p><p>HOW AEROPLANES REPORT OBSERVATIONS.&mdash;It  
may be of some interest to know how aeroplanes  
are able to report observations to the commanders  
in the field, from the airship itself. Many  
ingenious devices have been devised for this purpose.  
  
</p><p>SIGNAL FLAGS.&mdash;The best known and most universally  
used method is by the use of signaling  
flags. Suppose the commander of a force is desirous  
of getting the range of a hidden battery,  
or a massed force in his front. The observer in  
the aeroplane will sail over the area at an understood  
altitude, say one mile in height.  
  
</p><p>The officer in charge of the battery, knowing  
the height of the airship, is able, by means of  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0243" n="220"/>    
the angle thus given him, to get the distance between  
his battery and the concealed point beneath  
the airship. The observer in the airship, of  
course, signals the engineer officer, the exact point  
or time when the airship is directly above, and  
this gives him the correct angle.  
  
</p><p>The guns of the battery are then directed and  
fired so as to reach the concealed point. It is  
now important to be able to send intelligible signals  
to the officer in charge of the battery. If the  
shot goes beyond the mark, the observer in the  
airship raises the flag above his head, which indicates  
that it was too high.  
  
</p><p>HOW USED.&mdash;If the shot fell short he would  
lower the flag. If the shot landed too far to the  
right, this would be indicated by the flag, and if  
too far to the left, the signal would, in like manner,  
be sufficient to enable the gunners to correct  
the guns.  
  
</p><p>When the exact range is obtained the observer  
in the ship waves the flag about his head, in  
token of approval. All this work of noting the  
effect of the shots must be taken while the airship  
is under fire, and while circling about within  
visual range of the concealed object below.  
  
</p><p>The officer in charge of the battery, as well as  
the observer on the flying craft, must be equipped  
with powerful glasses, so the effect of the shots  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0244" n="221"/>    
may be noted on the one hand, and the signals  
properly read by the officer on the other hand.  
  
</p><p>It may be said, however, that air battles have  
not been frequent and that they have been merely  
incidents of the conditions under which they were  
operated. The mission of the aeroplane is now  
conceded to be purely one of observation, such as  
we have described.  
  
</p><p>Both French and German reports are full of  
incidents showing the value of observations, and  
also concerning the effects of bombs. Extracts  
from the diaries of prisoners gave many interesting  
features of the results of aeroplane work.  
  
</p><p>CASUALTIES DUE TO AEROPLANES.&mdash;In the diary  
of one was found the remark: "I was lucky to  
escape the bomb thrown by a French aviator at  
Conrobet, which killed eight of my companions."  
  
</p><p>Another says: "The Seventh Company of the  
Third Regiment of the Guard had eight killed and  
twenty-two wounded by bomb from a French aeroplane."  
  
</p><p>Another: "An officer showed us a torn coat  
taken from one of sixty soldiers wounded by a  
bomb from an aeroplane."  
  
</p><p>A prisoner says: "Near Neuville an aeroplane  
bomb dropped on a supply train, killed four men,  
wounded six, and killed a considerable number of  
horses."  
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002597_0245" n="222"/>    
  
</p><p>The Belgians, after their defeat and the capture  
of Antwerp, were forced to the west along  
the coast. In some way they learned that the  
Kaiser was about to occupy a ch&acirc;teau near Dixmunde.  
Several aviators flew above the position  
and dropped a number of bombs on the building,  
completely wrecking it, and it was fortunate that  
the Emperor left the building only twenty minutes  
before, as several of his aides and soldiers  
on duty were killed.  
  
</p><p>On numerous occasions the headquarters of the  
different commanders have been discovered and  
had to be moved to safer places.  
  
</p><p>During all these wonderful exploits which will  
live in history because men had the opportunity  
during the war to use them for the first time in  
actual conflict, the official reports have not  
mentioned the aviators by name. The deaths of the  
brave men have brought forth the acknowledgments  
of their services. During the first three  
months of the war it is estimated that over sixty  
aviators and aides had lost their lives in the conflict  
on the two great battle lines. This does not  
take into account those who met death on the  
Zeppelins, of which five had been destroyed during  
that time.</p>

of an article is the same, however far it may be from the center of the  
earth, whereas <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> changes, and becomes less and less as it  
recedes from the center of the earth.</item>  
  
<item><hi rend="bold">Margin.</hi> The edge; the principal difference between this  
word and <hi rend="italic">edge</hi>, is, that <hi rend="italic">margin</hi> has reference also to a

reference to the fact that it has only one supporting surface on the  
same plane. Biplanes have two supporting surfaces, one above the  
other.</item>

<item><hi rend="bold">Persistent.</hi> Keeping at it; determination to proceed.</item>  
  
<item><hi rend="bold">Perpendicular.</hi> At right angles to a surface. This term is  
sometimes wrongly applied in referring to an object, particularly to an

forwardly in the exact path made by the angle, for one complete turn,  
the distance traveled by the propeller axially indicates the pitch in  
feet.</item>  
  
<item><hi rend="bold">Placement.</hi> When an object is located at any particular  
point, so that it is operative the location is called the  
<hi rend="italic">placement</hi>.</item>  
  
<item><hi rend="bold">Plane.</hi> A flat surface for supporting a flying machine in  
the air. <hi rend="italic">Plane of movement</hi> pertains to the imaginary
