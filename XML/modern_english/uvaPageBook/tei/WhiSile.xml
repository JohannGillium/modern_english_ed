                <head>Chapter 1</head>


                <p>At about eight o'clock one evening of the early summer a group of men were seated
                    on a grass plot overlooking a broad river. The sun was just setting through the
                    forest fringe directly behind them. </p>
                <p>Of this group some reclined in the short grass, others lay flat on the bank's
                    slope, while still others leaned against the carriages of two highly ornamented
                    field-guns, whose embossed muzzles gaped silently at an eastern shore nearly two
                    miles distant. </p>
                <p>The men were busy with soft-voiced talk, punctuating their remarks with low
                    laughter of a singularly infectious character. It was strange speech, richly
                    embroidered with the musical names of places, with unfamiliar names of beasts,
                    and with unintelligible names of things. Ken&oacute;gami,
                    Mam&aacute;tawan, Weneb&oacute;gan, Kap&uacute;skas&iacute;ng,
                    the silver-fox, the sea-otter, the sable, the wolverine, the muskparka, ox, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0025" n="4"/> babiche, tump-line,
                    gidd&eacute;s,&mdash;these and others sang like arrows cleaving the
                    atmosphere of commoner words. In the distant woods the white throats and olive
                    thrushes called in a language hardly less intelligible. </p>
                <p>There scarcely needed the row of glistening birch-barks below the men, the
                    warehouse with its picketed lane, the tall flag-staff, the block-house stockade,
                    the half-bred women chatting over the low fences of the log-houses, the squaws
                    wandering to and fro in picturesque silence, the Indian children playing noisily
                    or standing in awe before the veranda of the white house, to inform the
                    initiated that this little forest-and river-girt settlement was a post of the
                    Honourable the Hudson's Bay Company. The time of sunset and the direction of the
                    river's flow would have indicated a high latitude. The mile-long meadow, with
                    its Indian camp, the oval of forest, the immense breadth of the river identified
                    the place as Conjuror's House. Thus the blue water in the distance was James
                    Bay, the river was the Moose; enjoying his Manila cheroot on the Factory veranda
                    with the other officers of the Company was Galen Albret, and these men lounging
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0026" n="5"/> on the river bank were the
                    Company's post-keepers and runners, the travellers of the Silent Places. </p>
                <p>They were of every age and dressed in a variety of styles. All wore ornamented
                    moccasins, head garters, and red sashes of worsted. As to the rest, each
                    followed his taste. So in the group could be seen bare heads, fillet-bound
                    heads, covered heads; shirt sleeves, woollen jerseys, and long, beautiful
                    blanket coats. Two things, however, proved them akin. They all possessed a lean,
                    wiry hardness of muscle and frame, a hawk-like glance of the eye, an almost
                    emaciated spareness of flesh on the checks. They all smoked pipes of strong plug
                    tobacco. </p>
                <p>Whether the bronze of their faces, thrown into relief by the evening glow, the
                    frowning steadiness of their eyes, or more fancifully the background of the
                    guns, the flag-staff and the stockade was most responsible, the militant
                    impression persisted strongly. These were the veterans of an hundred battles.
                    They were of the stuff forlorn hopes are fashioned from. A great enemy, a
                    powerful enemy, an enemy to he respected and feared had hardened them to the
                    unyielding. The adversary could almost he measured, the bitterness of the
                    struggle <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0027" n="6"/> almost he gauged from the
                    scars of their spirits; the harshness of it, the cruelty of it, the wonderful
                    immensity of it that should so fashion the souls and flesh of men. For to the
                    hearing of these loungers clung that hint of greater things which is never
                    lacking to those who have called the deeps of man's nature to the conquering. </p>
                <p>The sun dipped to the horizon, and over the landscape slipped the beautiful
                    north-country haze of crimson. From the distant forest sounded a single mournful
                    wolf-howl. At once the sledge-dogs answered in chorus. The twilight descended.
                    The men gradually fell silent, smoking their pipes, savouring the sharp
                    snow-tang, grateful to their toughened senses, that still lingered in the air. </p>
                <p>Suddenly out of the dimness loomed the tall form of an Indian, advancing with
                    long, straight strides. In a moment he was among them responding composedly to
                    their greetings. </p>
                <p>"Bo' jou', bo' jou', Me-en-gen," said they. </p>
                <p>"Bo' jou', bo' jou'," said he. </p>
                <p>He touched two of the men lightly on the shoulder. They arose, for they knew him
                    as the bowsman <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0028" n="7"/> of the Factor's canoe,
                    and so understood that Galen Albret desired their presence. </p>
                <p>Me-en-gen led the way in silence, across the grass plot, past the flag-staff, to
                    the foot of the steps leading to the Factory veranda. There the Indian left
                    them. They mounted the steps. A voice halted them in the square of light cast
                    through an intervening room from a lighted inner apartment. </p>
                <p>The veranda was wide and low; railed in; and, except for the square of light,
                    cast in dimness. A dozen men sat in chairs, smoking. Across the shaft of light
                    the smoke eddied strangely. A woman's voice accompanied softly the tinkle of a
                    piano inside. The sounds, Eke the lamplight, were softened by the distance of
                    the intervening room. </p>
                <p>Of the men on the veranda Galen Albret's identity alone was evident. Grim,
                    four-square, inert, his very way of sitting his chair, as though it were a seat
                    of judgment and be the interpreter of some fierce blood-law, betrayed him. From
                    under the bushy white tufts of his eyebrows the woodsmen felt the search of his
                    inspection. Unconsciously they squared their shoulders. </p>
                <p>The older had some fifty-five or sixty years, <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0029"
                        n="8"/> though his frame was still straight and athletic. A narrow-brimmed
                    slouch hat shadowed quiet, gray eyes, a hawk nose, a long sweeping white
                    mustache. His hands were tanned to a hard mahogany brown carved into veins,
                    cords, and gnarled joints. He had kindly humour in the wrinkles of his eyes, the
                    slowly developed imagination of the forest dweller in the deliberation of their
                    gaze, and an evident bard and wiry endurance. His dress, from the rough
                    pea-jacket to the unornamented moccasins, was severely plain. </p>
                <p>His companion was hardly more than a boy in years, though more than a man in
                    physical development. In every respect he seemed to he especially adapted to the
                    rigours of northern life. The broad arch of his chest, the plump smoothness of
                    his muscles, above all, the full roundness of his throat indicated that
                    warmth-giving blood, and plenty of it, would he pumped generously to every part
                    of his body. His face from any point of view but one revealed a handsome, jaunty
                    boy, whose heard was still a shade. But when he looked at one directly, the
                    immaturity fell away. This might have hen hocus of a certain confidence of
                    experience beyond <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0030" n="9"/> what most boys of
                    twenty can know, or it might have hen the result merely of a physical
                    peculiarity. For his eyes were so extraordinarily close together that they
                    seemed by their very proximity to pinch the bridge of his nose, and in addition,
                    they possessed a queer slant or cast which twinkled perpetually now in one, now
                    in the other. It invested him at once with an air singularly remote and
                    singularly determined. But at once when he looked away the old boyishness
                    returned, enhanced further by a certain youthful barbarity in the details of his
                    dress-a slanted heron's feather in his bat, a headed knife sheath, an excess of
                    ornamentation on his garters and moccasins, and the like. </p>
                <p>In a moment one of the men on the veranda began to talk. It was not Galen Albret,
                    though Galen Albret had summoned them, but MacDonald, his Chief Trader and his
                    right-band man. Galen Albret himself made no sign, but sat, his head sunk
                    forward, watching the men's faces from his cavernous eyes. </p>
                <p>"You have hen called for especial duty," began MacDonald, shortly. "It is
                    volunteer duty, and you need not go unless you want to. We have <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0031" n="10"/> called you hocus you have the
                    reputation of never having failed. That is not much for you, Herron, hocus you
                    are young. Still we believe in you. But you, Bolton, are an old hand on the
                    Trail, and it means a good deal." </p>
                <p>Galen Albret stirred. MacDonald shot a glance in his direction and hastened on. </p>
                <p>"I am going to tell you what we want. If you don't care to tackle the job, you
                    must know nothing about it. That is distinctly understood?" </p>
                <p>He bitched forward nearer the light, scanning the men carefully. They nodded. </p>
                <p>"Sure!" added Herron. </p>
                <p>"That's all right. Do you men remember Jingoss, the Ojibway, who outfitted here a
                    year ago last summer?" </p>
                <p>"Him they calls th' Weasel?" inquired Sam Bolton. </p>
                <p>"That's the one. Do you remember him well? how he looks?" </p>
                <p>"Yes," nodded Sam and Dick Herron together. </p>
                <p>"We've got to have that Indian." </p>
                <p>"Where is he?" asked Herron. Sam Bolton remained silent. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0032" n="11"/>
                </p>
                <p>"That is for you to find out." MacDonald then went on to explain himself,
                    hitching his chair still nearer, and lowering his voice. "A year ago last
                    summer," said he, "he got his 'debt' at the store of two hundred castors <ref
                        n="1" target="n1">[*]</ref> which he was to pay off in pelts the following
                    spring. He never came back. I don't think he intends to. The example is bad. It
                    has never happened to us before. Too many Indians get credit at this Post. If
                    this man is allowed to go unpunished, we'll be due for all sorts of trouble with
                    our other creditors. Not only he, but all the rest of them, must be made to feel
                    that an embezzler is going to be caught, every time. They all know he's stolen
                    that debt, and they're waiting to see what we're going to do about it. I tell
                    you this so you'll know that it's important." </p>
                <p>"You want us to catch him?" said Bolton, more as a comment than an inquiry. </p>
                <p>"Catch him, and catch him alive!" corrected MacDonald. "There must be no
                    shooting. We've got to punish him in a way that will make him an example. We've
                    got to allow our Indians 'debt' in order to keep them. If we run too great a
                    risk of <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0033" n="12"/> loss, we cannot do it. That is
                    a grave problem. In case of success you shall have double pay for the time you
                    are gone, and he raised two ranks in the service. Will you do it?" </p>
                <p>Sam Bolton passed his emaciated, gnarled hand gropingly across his mouth, his
                    usual precursor of speech. But Galen Albret abruptly interposed, speaking
                    directly, with authority, as was his habit. </p>
                <p>"Hold on," said he, "I want no doubt. If you accept this, you must not fail.
                    Either you must come back with that Indian, or you need not come back at all. I
                    won't accept any excuses for failure. I won't accept any failure. It does not
                    matter if it takes ten years. I <hi rend="italic">want that man</hi>." </p>
                <p>Abruptly he fell silent. After a moment MacDonald resumed his speech. </p>
                <p>"Think well. Let me know in the morning." </p>
                <p>Bolton again passed his hand gropingly before his mouth. </p>
                <p>"No need to wait for me," said he; "I'll do it." </p>
                <p>Dick Herron suddenly laughed aloud, startling to flight the gravities of the
                    moment. </p>
                <p>"If Sam here's got her figured out, I've no need to worry," he asserted. "I'm
                    with you." <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0034" n="13"/>
                </p>
                <p>"Very well," agreed MacDonald. "Remember, this must be kept quiet. Come to me for
                    what you need." </p>
                <p>"I will say good-by to you now," said Galen Albret. "I do not wish to be seen
                    talking to you to-morrow." </p>
                <p>The woodsmen stepped forward, and solemnly shook Galen Albret's band. He did not
                    arise to greet these men he was sending out into the Silent Places, for he was
                    the Factor, and not to many is it given to rule a country so rich and extended.
                    They nodded in turn to the taciturn smokers, then glided away into the darkness
                    on silent, moccasined feet. </p>
                <p>The night had fallen. Here and there through the gloom shone a lamp. Across the
                    north was a dim glow of phosphorescence, precursor of the aurora, from which
                    occasionally trembled for an instant a single shaft of light. The group by the
                    bronze field-cannon were humming softly the sweet and tender cadences of <hi
                        rend="italic">La Violette dandine</hi>. </p>
                <p>Instinctively the two woodsmen paused on the hither side of rejoining their
                    companions. Bolton's eyes were already clouded with the trouble of his
                    speculation. Dick Herron glanced at his comrade <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0035"
                        n="14"/> quizzically, the strange cast flickering in the wind of his
                    thought. </p>
                <p>"Oh, Sam!" said he. </p>
                <p>"What?" asked the older man, rousing. </p>
                <p>"Strikes me that by the time we get through drawin' that double pay on this job,
                    we'll be rich men-and old!"</p>

                <p>The men stood looking vaguely upward at the stars. </p>
                <p>Dick Herron whipped the grasses with a switch he had broken in passing a
                    willow-bush. His mind was little active. Chiefly he regretted the good time he
                    had promised himself here at the Post after the labour of an early spring march
                    from distant Winnipeg. He appreciated the difficulties of the undertaking, but
                    idly, as something that hardly concerned him. The details, the planning, he
                    dismissed from his mind, confident that his comrade would rise to that. In time
                    Sam Bolton would show him the point at which he was to bend his strength. Then
                    he would stoop his shoulders, shut his eyes, and apply the magnificent brute
                    force and pluck that was in him. So now he puckered his lips to the sibilance of
                    a canoe-song, and waited. </p>
                <p>But the other, Sam Bolton, the veteran woodsman, stood in rapt contemplation, his
                    wide-seeing, <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0037" n="16"/> gentle eyes of the old
                    man staring with the magnitude of his revery. </p>
                <p>Beyond the black velvet band lay the wilderness. There was the trackless country,
                    large as the United States itself, with its great forests, its unmapped bodies
                    of water, its plains, its barren grounds, its mountains, its water courses wider
                    even than the Hudson River. Moose and hear, true lords of the forest, he might
                    see any summer day. Herds of caribou, sometimes thousands strong, roamed its
                    woodlands and barrens. Wolves, lurking or bold as their prey was strong or weak,
                    clung to the caribou bands in hope of a victim. Wolverines, &mdash;unchanged
                    in form from another geological period marten, mink, fisher, otter, ermine,
                    muskrat, lynx, foxes, beaver carried on their varied affairs of murder or of
                    peaceful industry. Woods Indians, scarcely less keen of sense or natural of life
                    than the animals, dwelt in their wigwams of bark or skins, trapped and fished,
                    made their long migrations as the geese turn following their instinct. Sun,
                    shadow, rain, cold, snow, hunger, plenty, labour, or the peaceful gliding of
                    rivers, these had watched by the Long Trail in the years Sam Bolton had followed
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0038" n="17"/> it. He sensed them now dimly,
                    instinctively, waiting by the Trail he was called upon to follow. </p>
                <p>Sam Bolton had lived many years in the forest, and many years alone. Therefore he
                    had imagination. It might be of a limited quality, but through it he saw things
                    in their essences. </p>
                <p>Now from the safe vantage ground of the camp, from the breathing space before the
                    struggle, he looked out upon the wilderness, and in the wilderness he felt the
                    old, inimical Presence as he had felt it for forty years. The scars of that long
                    combat throbbed through his consciousness. The twisting of his strong hands, the
                    loosening of the elasticity, the humbling of the spirit, the caution that had
                    displaced the carelessness of youth, the keenness of eye, the patience,-all
                    these were at once the marks of blows and the spoils of victory received from
                    the Enemy. The wilderness, calm, ruthless, just, terrible, waited in the shadow
                    of the forest, seeking no combat, avoiding none, conquering with a lofty air of
                    predestination, yielding superbly as though the moment's victory for which a man
                    had strained the fibres of his soul were, after all, a little, unimportant
                    thing; never weary, never exultant, dispassionate, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0039" n="18"/> inevitable, mighty, whose emotions
                    were silence, whose speech was silence, whose most terrible weapon was the great
                    white silence that smothered men's spirits. Sam Bolton clearly saw the North. He
                    felt against him the steady pressure of her resistance. She might yield, but
                    relentlessly, regained her elasticity. Men's efforts against her would tire; the
                    mechanics of her power remained constant. What she lost in the moments of her
                    opponent's might, she recovered in the hours of his weakness, so that at the
                    last she won, poised in her original equilibrium above the bodies of her
                    antagonists. Dimly he felt these things, personifying the wilderness in his
                    imagination of the old man, arranging half-consciously his weapons of craft in
                    their due order. </p>
                <p>Somewhere out beyond in those woods, at any one of the thirty-two points of the
                    compass, a man was lurking. He might be five or five hundred miles away. He was
                    an expert at taking care of himself in the woods. Abruptly Sam Bolton began to
                    formulate his thoughts aloud. </p>
                <p>"We got to keep him or anybody else from knowin' we's after him, Dick," said he.
                    "Jest as <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0040" n="19"/> soon as he knows that, it's
                    just too easy for him to keep out of our way. Lucky Jingoss is an Ojibway, and
                    his people are way off south. We can fool this crowd here easy enough; we'll
                    tell 'em we're looking for new locations for winter posts. But she's an awful
                    big country." </p>
                <p>"Which way 'll we go first?" asked Dick, without, however, much interest in the
                    reply. Whatever Sam decided was sure to be all right. </p>
                <p>"It's this way," replied the latter. "He's got to trade somewheres. He can't come
                    into any of the Posts here at the Bay. What's the nearest? Why,
                    Missin&aacute;ibie , down in Lake Superior country. Probably he's down in
                    that country somewheres. We'll start south." </p>
                <p>"That's Ojibway country," hazarded Dick at random. </p>
                <p>"It's Ojibway country, but Jingoss is a Georgian Bay Ojibway. Down near
                    Missin&aacute;ibie every Injun has his own hunting district, and they're
                    different from our Crees,-they stick pretty close to their district. Any
                    strangers trying to bunt and trap there are going to get shot, sure pop. That
                    makes me think that if Jingoss has gone south, and <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0041" n="20"/> if he's trading now at
                    Missin&aacute;ibie , and if he ain't chummed up with some of them Ojibways
                    to get permission to trap in their allotments, and if he ain't pushed right on
                    home to his own people or out west to Winnipeg country, then most likely we'll
                    find him somewheres about the region of th' Kabinak&aacute;gam." </p>
                <p>"So we'll go up th' Missin&aacute;ibie River first," surmised Dick. </p>
                <p>"That's how we'll make a start," assented Bolton. </p>
                <p>As though this decision had terminated an interview, they turned with one accord
                    toward the dim group of their companions. As they approached, they were
                    acclaimed. </p>
                <p>"Here he is," "Dick, come here," "Dick, sing us the song. <foreign lang="fr"
                        >Chante donc 'Oncle Naid,'</foreign> Deeck." </p>
                <p>And Dick, leaning carelessly against the breech of the field-guns, in a rich,
                    husky baritone crooned to the far north the soft syllables of the far south.</p>

                <p>In the selection of paddles early next morning Sam insisted that the Indian rule
                    he observed, measuring carefully that the length of each implement should just
                    equal the heights of its wielder. He chose the narrow maple blade, that it might
                    not split when thrust against the bottom to check speed in a rapid. Further the
                    blades were stained a brilliant orange. </p>
                <p>Dick Herron had already picked one of a dozen birch-bark canoes laid away under
                    the bridge over the dry coulee. He knew a good canoe as you would know a good
                    horse. Fourteen feet it measured, of the heavy winter-cut of bark, and with a
                    bottom all of one piece, without cracks or large knots. </p>
                <p>The canoe and the paddles they laid at the water's edge. Then they went together
                    to the great warehouse, behind the grill of whose upper room MacDonald was
                    writing. Ordinarily the trappers were not allowed inside the grill, but Dick and
                    Sam <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0043" n="22"/> were told to help themselves
                    freely. The stocking Dick left to his older companion, assuring himself merely
                    of an hundred rounds of ammunition for his new model Winchester rifle, the 44-40
                    repeater, then just entering the outskirts of its popularity. </p>
                <p>In the obscurity of the wide, low room the old woodsman moved to and fro, ducking
                    his head to avoid things hanging, peering into corners, asking an occasional
                    question of MacDonald, who followed him silently about. Two small steel traps, a
                    narrow, small-meshed fish-net, a fish-line and hooks, powder, ball, and caps for
                    the old man's muzzle-loader, a sack of salt were first laid aside. This
                    represented subsistence. Then matches, a flint-and-steel machine, two four-point
                    blankets. These meant warmth. Then ten pounds of plug tobacco and as many of
                    tea. These were necessary luxuries. And finally a small sack of flour and a side
                    of bacon. These were merely a temporary provision; when they should be
                    exhausted, the men would rely wholly on the forest. </p>
                <p>Sam Bolton hovered over the pile, after it was completed, his eyes half shut,
                    naming over its items again and again, assuring himself that nothing <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0044" n="23"/> lacked. At his side MacDonald made
                    suggestions. </p>
                <p>"Got a copper pail, Sam? a frying-pan? cups? How about the axe? Better have an
                    extra knife between you. Need any clothes? Compass all right?" </p>
                <p>To each of these questions Sam nodded an assent. So MacDonald, having named
                    everything&mdash;with the exception of the canvas square to be used as a
                    tarpaulin or a tent, and soap and towel-fell silent, convinced that he could do
                    nothing more. </p>
                <p>But Dick, who had hen drumming his fingers idly against the window, turned with a
                    suggestion, of his own. "How're we fixed for shoe pacs? I haven't got any". </p>
                <p>At once MacDonald looked blank. </p>
                <p>"By George, boys, I ain't got but four or five pairs of moccasins in the place!
                    There's plenty of oil tan; I can fix you all right there. But smoke tans! That
                    Abitibi gang mighty near cleaned me out. You'll have to try the Indians." </p>
                <p>Accordingly Bolton and Herron took their way in the dusty little foot-trodden
                    path-there were <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0045" n="24"/> no horses in that
                    frontier-between the Factor's residence and the Clerk's house, down the
                    meandering trail through the high grasses of the meadow to where the Indian
                    lodges lifted their pointed tops against the sky. </p>
                <p>The wigwams were scattered apparently at random. Heifer each a fire burned. Women
                    and girls busied themselves with a variety of camp-work. A tame crow hopped and
                    fluttered here and there just out of reach of the pointed-nosed, shaggy
                    wolf-dogs. </p>
                <p>The latter rushed madly forward at the approaching strangers, yelping in a
                    curious, long-drawn bay, more suggestive of their wolf ancestors than of the
                    domestic animal., Dick and Sam laid about them vigorously with short staffs they
                    had brought for the purpose. Immediately the dogs, recognising their dominance,
                    slunk back. Three men sauntered forward, grinning broadly in amiable greeting.
                    Two or three women, more bashful than the rest, scuttled into the depths of
                    wigwams out of sight. A multitude of children concealed themselves craftily,
                    like a covey of quail, and focussed their bright, head-like eyes on the
                    newcomers. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0046" n="25"/> The rest of the camp went
                    its way unmoved. </p>
                <p>"Bo' jou', bo' jou'," greeted Sam Bolton. </p>
                <p>"Bo' jou', bo' jou'," replied the three. </p>
                <p>These Indians were of the far upper country. They spoke no English nor French,
                    and adhered still to their own tribal customs and religious observances. They
                    had lingered several days beyond their time for the purpose of conjuring. In
                    fact at this very moment the big medicine lodge raised itself in the centre of
                    the encampment like a miniature circus tent. Sam Bolton addressed the two in
                    their own language. </p>
                <p>"We wish to buy many moccasins of your old women," said Sam. </p>
                <p>Immediately one of the Indians glided away. From time to time during the next few
                    minutes he was intermittently visible as he passed from the dark interior of one
                    wigwam, across the sunlight, and into the dark interior of another. </p>
                <p>The older of the two still in company of the white men began to ask questions. </p>
                <p>"The Little Father is about to make a long journey?" <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0047" n="26"/>
                </p>
                <p>"Does one buy so many moccasins for a short F" </p>
                <p>"He goes to hunt the fur?" </p>
                <p>"Perhaps." </p>
                <p>"In what direction does he set the bow of his canoe?" </p>
                <p>Suddenly Dick Herron, who had, as usual, hen paying attention to almost anything
                    rather than the matter in band, darted suddenly toward a clump of grass. In a
                    moment he straightened his back to bold at arms length a struggling little boy.
                    At the instant of his seizure the child uttered a sharp cry of fright, then
                    closed his lips in the stoicism of his race. </p>
                <p>That one cry was enough, however. Rescue darted from the nearest wigwam. A flying
                    figure covered the little distance in a dozen graceful leaps, snatched the child
                    from the young man's bands and stood, one foot advanced, breast heaving, a
                    palpitating, wild thing, like a symbol of defiance. </p>
                <p>The girl belonged distinctly to the more attractive type; it required but little
                    imagination to endow her with real beauty. Her figure was straight and slim and
                    well-proportioned, her eyes large, her face oval and quite devoid of the broad,
                    high-cheeked </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0048"/>
                <p>The child uttered a sharp cry of fright</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0049"/>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0050" n="27"/>
                <p>cheeked stupidity so common in the northern races. At the moment she flashed like
                    a brand with quick-breathed anger and fear. </p>
                <p>Dick looked at her at first with amazement, then with mingled admiration and
                    mischief. He uttered a ferocious growl and lowered his shoulders as though about
                    to charge. Immediately the defiance broke. The girl turned and fled, plunging
                    like a rabbit into the first shelter that offered, pursued by shrieks of delight
                    from the old squaws, a pleased roar from Dick, and the laughter of the Indian
                    men themselves. </p>
                <p>"May-may-gw&aacute;n,"<ref n="2" target="n2">[*]</ref> said the oldest
                    Indian, naming her, "foster sister to the boy you had caught." </p>
                <p>"She is Ojibway, then," exclaimed Dick, catching at the Ojibway word. </p>
                <p>"Ae," admitted the Cree, indifferently. Such inclusions of another tribe, either
                    by adoption or marriage, are not uncommon. </p>
                <p>At this moment the third Indian approached. </p>
                <p>"No moccasins," he reported. "Plenty buckskin." <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0051"
                        n="28"/>
                </p>
                <p>Sam Bolton looked troubled. This meant a delay. However, it could not be avoided. </p>
                <p>"Let the old women make some," he decided. </p>
                <p>The Cree old-man shook his head. </p>
                <p>"That cannot be. There is not time. We turn our canoes to the
                    Missin&aacute;ibie by next sun." </p>
                <p>Sam pondered again, turning over in his mind this fresh complication. But Dick,
                    kicking the earth clods in impatience, broke in. </p>
                <p>"Well, we're going by the Missin&aacute;ibie , too. Let the women make the
                    moccasins. We will accompany you." </p>
                <p>"That might be," replied the Indian. </p>
                <p>"It is well," said Bolton. </p>
                <p>An old woman was summoned. She measured her customers' feet with a buckskin
                    thong. Then, they departed without further ceremony. An Indian rarely says
                    farewell. When his business is finished he goes. </p>
                <p>"Dick," said Sam, "you ought not to have broke in there." </p>
                <p>"What do you mean?" asked the other, puzzled. </p>
                <p>"Suggesting our travelling with them." <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0052" n="29"/>
                </p>
                <p>"Why?" cried Dick in astonishment. "Ain't you never travelled with Injuns
                    before?" </p>
                <p>"That ain't th' question. Did you notice that third Injun? the one who didn't do
                    any talking?" </p>
                <p>"Sure! What of him?" </p>
                <p>"Well, he's an Ojibway. Th' rest are Wood Crees. And I miss my guess if he ain't
                    a bad customer. He watched us mighty close, and his eyes are bad. He's sharp.
                    He's one of that wondering kind. He's wondering now who we are, and where we're
                    going, and why we're hitting so long a trail. And what's more, he belongs to
                    this Jingoss's people in a roundabout sort of way. He's worse than fifty Crees.
                    Maybe he knows all about Jingoss, and if he does, he'll get suspicious the
                    minute we angle down into that country." </p>
                <p>"Let's let 'em slide, then," suggested Dick, impatiently. "Let's buy some
                    buckskin and make our own moccasins." </p>
                <p>"Too late now," negatived Sam. "To back out would be bad." </p>
                <p>"Oh, well, you're just borrowing trouble anyway," laughed Dick. </p>
                <p>"Maybe, maybe," acknowledged the other "but <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0053"
                        n="30"/> borrowing trouble, and then figuring out how you're going to meet
                    it if it comes to you in good earnest, is mighty good woodcraft." </p>
                <p>"Sam," burst out Dick, whose attention had hen caught by a word in his
                    companion's first speech, and whose mind had hen running on it throughout the
                    ensuing discussion, "did you notice that girl? She's a tearing little beauty!"</p>

                <p>By now it was nearly noon. The travellers carried the packs they had made up down
                    to the water-side where the canoe lay. Although the Indians would not get under
                    way until the following morning, it had hen decided to push on at once, thus
                    avoiding the confusion of a crowded start. </p>
                <p>In the course of the morning's business the news of their expedition had noised
                    abroad. Especially were they commiserated by the other runners and post-keepers.
                    During all the winter these men had lived under the frown of the North,
                    conducting their affairs confidently yet with caution, sure of themselves, yet
                    never sure of the great power in whose tolerance they existed, in spite of whom
                    they accomplished. Now was the appointed time of rest. In the relaxation of the
                    thought they found pity for those ordered out of season into the Silent Places. </p>
                <p> So at the river's bank Sam Bolton and Dick Herron, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0055" n="32"/> ready for departure, found a group
                    gathered. It was supposed that these men were to act as scouts, to reconnoitre
                    shrewdly in the Enemy's country, to spy out the land, so that in the autumn the
                    Company might throw into the wilderness new posts, to be inhabited during the
                    colder months. </p>
                <p>"Look heem Bla'k Hevair Lak," advised Louis Placide; "I t'ink dose Ojibway mak'
                    heem lots marten, mink la has." </p>
                <p>"Lads," said Kern, the trader at Old Brunswick House, "if you're going up th'
                    Missin&aacute;ibie just cast an eye on my <hi rend="italic">cache</hi> at
                    Gull Lake, and see that the carcajaus have let her be." </p>
                <p>Young Herbert was curious. "Where are you headed, boys?" he inquired. </p>
                <p>But Ki-wa-nee, the trusty, the trader at Flying Post, the only Indian in the
                    Company's service holding rank as a commissioned officer, grunted in contempt at
                    the question, while Achard, of New Brunswick House, motioned warningly toward
                    the groups of Indian trappers in the background. "Hush, boy," said he to
                    Herbert, "news travels, and in the south are the Free Traders to snatch at a new
                    country." <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0056" n="33"/>
                </p>
                <p>By now the voyageurs had turned their canoe over, slid it into the water, and
                    piled the duffle amidships. </p>
                <p>But before they had time to step aboard, came Virginia Albret, then seventeen
                    years old and as slender and graceful as a fawn. The daughter of the Factor, she
                    had acquired a habit of command that became her well. While she enunciated her
                    few and simple words of well-wishing, she looked straight out at them from deep
                    black eyes. The two woodsmen, awed into a vast respect, fumbled their caps in
                    their hands and noted, in the unconscious manner of the forest frequenter, the
                    fresh dusk rose of her skin, the sharply defined red of her lips, the soft wheat
                    colour of her hair. It was a gracious memory to carry into the Silent Places,
                    and was in itself well worth the bestowal. However, Virginia, as was her habit,
                    gave presents. On each she bestowed a long silk handkerchief. Sam Bolton, with a
                    muttered word of thanks, stuffed his awkwardly into his shirt bosom. Dick, on
                    the other hand, with a gesture half of gallantry, half of bravado, stripped his
                    own handkerchief from his neck and cast it far into the current, knotting the
                    girl's <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0057" n="34"/> gift in its place. Virginia
                    smiled. A strong push sent the canoe into the current. They began to paddle
                    up-stream. </p>
                <p>For perhaps a mile their course threaded in and out the channel of a number of
                    islands, then shot them into the broad reach of the Moose itself. There they set
                    themselves to straight-forward paddling, hugging closely the shore that they
                    might escape as much as possible the full strength of the current. In this
                    manner they made rapid progress, for, of course, they paddled in the Indian
                    fashion -without heeding either elbow, and with a strong thrust forward of the
                    shoulders at the end of the stroke and they understood well how to take
                    advantage of each little back eddy. </p>
                <p>After an hour and a half they came to the first unimportant rapids, where they
                    were forced to drop their paddles and to use the long spruce-poles they had cut
                    and peeled that morning. Dick had the bow. It was beautiful to see him standing
                    boldly upright, his feet apart, leaning back against the pressure, making head
                    against the hurrying water. In a moment the canoe reached the point of hardest
                    suction, where. the river. broke over the descent. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0058" n="36"/> Then the young man, taking a deep
                    breath, put forth the strength that was in him. Sam Bolton, poised in the stern,
                    holding the canoe while his companion took a fresh hold, noted with approval the
                    boy's physical power, the certainty of his skill at the difficult river work,
                    the accuracy of his calculations. Whatever his heedlessness, Dick Herron knew
                    his trade. It was, indeed, a powerful instrument that Galen Albret in his wisdom
                    had placed in Sam Bolton's hands. </p>
                <p>The canoe, torn from the rapid's grasp, shot into the smooth water above. Calmly
                    Sam and Dick shook the water from their poles and laid them across the thwarts.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Swish click! swish click </hi> of the paddles resumed. </p>
                <p>Now the river began to hurry in the ten-mile descent below the Abitibi. Although
                    the smooth rush of water was unbroken by the swirls of rapids, nevertheless the
                    current proved too strong for paddling. The voyagers were forced again to the
                    canoe poles, and so toiled in graceful but strenuous labour the remaining hours
                    of their day's journey. When finally they drew ashore for the night, they had
                    but just passed the mouth of French River. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0059"
                        n="36"/>
                </p>
                <p>To men as skilled as they, the making of camp was a brief affair. Dick, with his
                    axe, cleared the space of underbrush, and sought dry wood for fuel. The older
                    man in the meantime hunted about until he found a dead white-birch sapling. This
                    he easily thrust to the ground with a strong push of his band. The jar burst
                    here and there the hard envelope of the birch bark to expose a quantity of
                    half-powdery, decayed wood, dry as tinder and almost as inflammable as
                    gunpowder. Into a handful of this Sam threw the sparks from his flint and steel.
                    The bark itself fed admirably the first flame. By the time Dick returned, the
                    fire was ready for his fuel. </p>
                <p>They cooked tea in the copper pail, and roasted bacon on the ends of switches.
                    This, with bread from the Post, constituted their meal. After supper they
                    smoked, banked the fire with green wood, and rolled themselves in their blankets
                    to sleep. It was summer, so they did not trouble to pitch their shelter. </p>
                <p>The night died into silence. Slowly the fire worked from within through the
                    chinks of the green logs. Forest creatures paused to stare at it with <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0060" n="37"/> steady eyes, from which flashed back a
                    blaze as intense as the fire's own. An owl took his station near and began to
                    call. Overhead the brilliant aurora of the Far North palpitated in a silence
                    that seemed uncanny when coupled with such intensity of movement. Shadows stole
                    here and there like acolytes. Breezes rose and died like the passing of a
                    throng. The woods were peopled with uncanny influences, intangible, unreal, yet
                    potent with the symbolism of the unknown Presence watching these men. The North,
                    calm, patient, biding her time, serene in the assurance of might, drew close to
                    the camp in the wilderness. </p>
                <p>By and by a little pack of wolves came and squatted on their haunches just in the
                    shadow. They were well fed and harmless, but they sat there blinking lazily at
                    the flames, their tongues lolling, exactly like so many shaggy and good-humoured
                    dogs. About two o'clock Dick rolled out of his blanket and replenished the fire.
                    He did it somnolently, his eyes vacant, his expression that of a child. Then he
                    took a half-comprehending glance at the heaven's promise of fair weather, and
                    sank again into the warmth of his blanket. The wolves had not stirred.</p>

                <p>Now the small sack of flour and the side of bacon and the loose provisions
                    brought from the Post could last but a little time, and the journey was like to
                    be long. The travellers were to be forced from now on, just as are the wolves,
                    the eagles, the hawks, the carcajous, and other predatory creatures of the
                    woods, to give their first thoughts to the day's sustenance. All other
                    considerations gave way to this. This was the first, the daily tribute to be
                    wrested from the stubborn grasp of the North. Winning that, anything was
                    possible; failing that, nothing could follow but defeat. Therefore, valuable
                    exceedingly were the two little steel traps and the twelve-foot length of
                    gill-net, the sharp, thin knives in the headed sheaths, and especially precious,
                    precious above all things else, the three hundred rounds of ammunition for the
                    rifles. They must be guarded and cared for and saved. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0062" n="39"/>
                </p>
                <p>Therefore an incident of the early afternoon was more than welcome. </p>
                <p>All the morning they had toiled against the current, sometimes poling, sometimes
                    "tracking" by means of a sixty-foot cod-line. Dick looped this across his chest
                    and pulled like a horse on the towpath, while Sam Bolton sat in the stem with
                    the steering-paddle. The banks were sometimes precipitous, sometimes stony,
                    sometimes grown to the water's edge with thick vegetation. Dick had often to
                    wade, often to climb and scramble, sometimes even to leap from one foothold to
                    another. Only rarely did he enjoy level footing and the opportunity for a
                    straight pull. Suddenly in a shallow pool, near the river's edge, and bordered
                    with waist-high grass, he came upon a flock of black ducks. They were full
                    grown, but as yet unable to fly. Dick dropped his tow-line and ran forward with
                    a shout. At once the ducks became confused, scattering in all directions,
                    squawking madly, spattering the water. The mother flew. The brood, instead of
                    making for the open river, where it would have hen safe, scuttled into the tall
                    grasses. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0063" n="40"/>
                </p>
                <p>Here was the chance for fresh meat without the expenditure of a shot. Sam Bolton
                    promptly disembarked. To us it would have seemed a simple matter. But the black
                    duck is an expert at concealment, even in the open. He can do wonders at it when
                    assisted by the shadows of long grass. And when too closely approached he can
                    glide away to right and left like a snake, leaving no rustle to betray his
                    passage. Five minutes passed before the first was discovered. Then it was only
                    hocus Dick's keen eye had detected a faintly stirring grass-blade ten feet away,
                    and hocus Dick's quick muscles had brought him like a tiger to the spot. He held
                    up his victim by the neck. </p>
                <p>"Good enough," growled Sam. </p>
                <p>And although they had seen nine ducks go into the grass plot, which was not more
                    than fifty feet across, they succeeded in finding but three. However, they were
                    satisfied. </p>
                <p>In spite of the deliberation of their journeying, the Indians did not overtake
                    them until nearly dark. It was just above the junction of the Abitibi. The river
                    was without current, the atmosphere without the suspicion of a breeze. Down to
                    the very <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0064" n="41"/> water's edge grew the forest,
                    so velvet-dark that one could not have guessed where the shadow left off and the
                    reflection began. Not a ripple disturbed the peace of the water, nor a harsh
                    sound the twilight peace of the air. Sam and Dick had paddled for some time
                    close to one bank, and now had paused to enjoy their pipes and the cool of the
                    evening. Suddenly against the reflected sky at the lower bend a canoe loomed
                    into sight, and crept smoothly and noiselessly under the forest shadow of the
                    opposite bank. Another followed, then another, and another and still another in
                    regular interval. Not a sound could be heard. In the distance their occupants
                    gave the illusion of cowled figures&mdash;the Indian women close wrapped in
                    their shawls, dropping their heads modestly or turning them aside as their
                    customs commanded them to do on encountering strangers. Against the evening glow
                    of the reflected sky for a single instant they stood out in the bright yellow of
                    the new birch-bark, the glow of warm colour on the women's dress. Then
                    instantaneously, in the darkness of the opposite bank, they faded wraith-like
                    and tenuous. Like phantoms of the past they glided by, a river's width <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0065" n="42"/> away; then vanished around the upper
                    bend. A moment later the river was empty. </p>
                <p>"Th' squaws goin' ahead to start camp," commented. Sam Bolton, indifferently;
                    "we'll have th' bucks along pretty quick." </p>
                <p>They drove their paddles strongly, and drifted to the middle of the river. </p>
                <p>Soon became audible shouts, cries, and laughter, the click of canoe poles. The
                    business of the day was over. Until nearly sundown the men's canoes had led,
                    silent, circumspect, seeking game at every bend of the river. Now the squaws had
                    gone on to make camp. No more game was to be expected. The band relaxed, joking,
                    skylarking, glad to be relieved for a little while of the strain of attention. </p>
                <p>In a moment the canoes appeared, a long, unbroken string, led by Haukemah. In the
                    bow sat the chief's son, a lad of nine, wielding his little paddle skilfully,
                    already intelligent to twist the prow sharply away from submerged rocks,
                    learning to be a canoe-man so that in the time to come he might go on the Long
                    Trail. </p>
                <p>Each canoe contained, besides its two occupants, a variety of household goods,
                    and a dog or two <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0066" n="43"/> coiled and
                    motionless, his sharp nose resting between his outstretched forepaws. The tame
                    crow Occupied an ingenious cage of twisted osiers. </p>
                <p>Haukemah greeted the two white men cordially, and stopped paddling to light his
                    pipe. One by one the other canoes joined them. A faint haze of tobacco rose from
                    the drifting group. </p>
                <p>"My brothers have made a long sun," observed old Haukemah. "We, too, have
                    hastened. Now we have met, and it is well. Down past the white rock it became
                    the fortune of Two-fingers to slay a caribou that stood by the little water.<ref
                        n="3" target="n3">[*]</ref> Also had we whitefish the evening before. Past
                    the Island of the Three Trees were signs of moose." He was telling them the
                    news, as one who passed the time of day. </p>
                <p>"We have killed but neenee-sheeb, the duck," replied Dick, holding up one of the
                    victims by the neck, "nor have we seen the trail of game." </p>
                <p>"Ah hah," replied Haukemah, politely. </p>
                <p>He picked up his paddle. It was the signal to start. </p>
                <p>"Drop in astern," said Dick to his companion in <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0067"
                        n="44"/> English, "it's the light of the evening, and I'm going to troll for
                    a pickerel." </p>
                <p>One by one the canoes fell into line. Now, late in the day, the travel was most
                    leisurely. A single strong stroke of the paddle was always succeeded by a pause
                    of contemplation. Nevertheless the light craft skimmed on with almost
                    extraordinary buoyancy, and in silent regularity the wooded points of the river
                    succeeded one another. </p>
                <p>Sam busied himself with the trolling-spoon, but as soon as the last canoe was
                    well beyond hearing he burst out: </p>
                <p>"Dick, did you notice the Chippewa?" </p>
                <p>"No. What?" </p>
                <p>"He understands English." </p>
                <p>"How do you know?" </p>
                <p>"He was right behind us when you told me you were goin' to try the fishing, and
                    he moved out th' way before we'd raised our paddles." </p>
                <p>"Might have hen an accident." </p>
                <p>"Perhaps, but I don't believe it. He looked too almighty innocent. Another thing,
                    did you notice he was alone in his canoe?" </p>
                <p>"What of it?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0068" n="45"/>
                </p>
                <p>"Shows he ain't noways popular with th' rest. Generally they pair off. There's
                    mostly something shady about these renegades." "Well?" "Oh, nothing. Only we got
                    to be careful."</p>

                <p>Camp was made among the trees of an elevated bank above a small brook. </p>
                <p>Already the Indian women had pitched the shelters, spreading squares of canvas,
                    strips of birch-bark or tanned skins over roughly improvised lean-to poles. A
                    half dozen tiny fires, too, they had built, over which some were at the moment
                    engaged in hanging as many kettles. Several of the younger women were cleaning
                    fish and threading them on switches. Others brought in the small twigs for fuel.
                    Among them could be seen May-may-gw&aacute;n, the young Ojibway girl,
                    gliding here and there, eyes downcast, inexpressibly graceful in contrast with
                    the Crees. </p>
                <p>At once on landing the men took up their share of the work. Like the birds of the
                    air and the beasts of the wood their first thoughts turned to the assurance of
                    food. Two young fellows stretched a gillnet across the mouth of the creek.
                    Others scattered in search of favourable spots in which to set the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0070" n="47"/> musk-rat traps, to hang snares for
                    rabbits and grouse. </p>
                <p>Soon the camp took on the air of age, of long establishment, that is so suddenly
                    to be won in the forest. The kettles began to bubble; the impaled fish to turn
                    brown. A delicious odour of open-air cooking permeated the air. Men filled pipes
                    and smoked in contemplation; children warmed themselves as near the tiny fires
                    as they dared. Out of the dense blackness of the forest from time to time
                    staggered what at first looked to be an uncouth and misshapen monster, but which
                    presently resolved itself into an Indian leaning under a burden of
                    spruce-boughs, so smoothly laid along the haft of a long forked stick that the
                    hearer of the burden could sling it across his shoulder like a bale of hay. As
                    he threw it to the ground, a delicate spice-like aroma disengaged itself to
                    mingle with the smell of cooking. Just at the edge of camp sat the wolf-dogs,
                    their yellow eyes gleaming, waiting in patience for their tardy share. </p>
                <p>After the meal the women drew apart. Dick's eyes roved in vain, seeking a glimpse
                    of the Ojibway girl. He was too familiar with Indian etiquette <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0071" n="48"/> to make an advance, and in fact his
                    interest was but languidly aroused. </p>
                <p>The men sat about the larger fire smoking. It was the hour of relaxation. In the
                    blaze their handsome or strong-lined brown faces lighted good-humouredly. They
                    talked and laughed in low tones, the long syllables of their language lisping
                    and hissing in strange analogy to the noises of the fire or the forest or the
                    rapids or some other natural thing. Their speech was of the chances of the woods
                    and the approaching visit to their Ojibway brothers in the south. For this they
                    had brought their grand ceremonial robes of deerskin, now stowed securely in
                    bags. The white men were silent. In a little while the pipes were finished. The
                    camp was asleep. Through the ashes and the embers prowled the wolf-dogs, but
                    half-fed, seeking scraps. Soon they took to the beach in search of cast-up fish.
                    There they wandered all night long under the moon voicing their immemorial
                    wrongs to the silenced forest. </p>
                <p>Almost at first streak of dawn the women were abroad. Shortly after, the men
                    visited their traps and lifted the nets. In this land and season of <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0072" n="49"/> plenty the catch had hen good. The
                    snares had strangled three hares; the steel traps had caught five muskrats,
                    which are very good eating in spite of their appearance; the net had intercepted
                    a number of pickerel, suckers, and river whitefish. This, with the meat of the
                    caribou, shot by Three Fingers the day before, and the supplies brought from the
                    Post, made ample provision. </p>
                <p>Nevertheless, when the camp had hen struck and the canoes loaded, the order of
                    march was reversed. Now the men took the lead by a good margin, and the women
                    and children followed. For in the wooded country game drinks early. </p>
                <p>Heifer setting out, however, old Haukemah blazed a fair clean place on a
                    fir-tree, and with hard charcoal from the fire marked on it these characters:
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0073" n="50"/> "can you read Injun writin'?" asked
                    Dick. "I can't." </p>
                <p>"Yes," replied Sam, "learned her when I was snowed up one winter with Sear-Face
                    down by the Burwash Lake country." He squinted his eyes, reading the syllables
                    slowly. </p>
                <p>"'Abichi-k&amacr;-men&oacute;t
                    Moosam&iacute;k-k&amacr;-j&abreve; yank. Missow&amacr; edookan
                    ow&amacr;si sek negi&mdash; -' Why, it's Ojibway, not Cree," he
                    exclaimed. "They're just leaving a record. 'Good journey from Moose Factory, Big
                    game has hen seen.' Funny how plumb curious an Injun is. They ain't one could
                    come along here and see th' signs of this camp and rest easy 'till he'd figgered
                    out how many they were, and where they were going, and what they were doing, and
                    all about it. These records are a kind-hearted try to save other Injuns that
                    come along a whole lot of trouble. That's why old Haukemah wrote it in Ojibway
                    'stead of Cree: this is by rights Ojibway country. </p>
                <p>"We'd better pike out, if we don't want to get back with th' squaws," suggested
                    Dick. </p>
                <p>About two hours before noon, while the men's squadron was paddling slowly along a
                    flat bank <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0074" n="51"/> overgrown with grass and
                    bushes, Dick and Sam perceived a sudden excitement in the leading canoes.
                    Haukemah stopped, then cautiously backed until well behind the screen of the
                    point. The other canoes followed his example. In a moment they were all headed
                    down stream, creeping along noiselessly without lifting their paddles from the
                    water. </p>
                <p>"They've seen some game beyant the point," whispered Dick. "Wonder what it is?" </p>
                <p>But instead of pausing when out of earshot for the purpose of uncasing the guns
                    or landing a stalking party, the Indians crept gradually from the shore, caught
                    the current, and shot away down stream in the direction from which they had
                    come. </p>
                <p>"It's a hear," said Sam, quietly. "They've gone to get their war-paint on." </p>
                <p>The men rested the bow of their canoe lightly against the shore, and waited. In a
                    short time the Indian canoes reappeared. </p>
                <p>"Say, they've surely got th' dry goods!" commented Dick, amused. </p>
                <p>In the short interval that had elapsed, the Indians had intercepted their women,.
                    unpacked their baggage, and arrayed themselves in their finest <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0075" n="52"/> dress of ceremony. Buckskin
                    elaborately embroidered with heads and silks in the flower pattern, ornaments of
                    brass and silver, sacred skins of the beaver, broad dashes of ochre and
                    vermilion on the naked skin, twisted streamers of coloured wool-all added to the
                    barbaric gorgeousness of the old-time savage in his native state. Each bowsman
                    carried a long brass-bound forty-five "trade-'gun," warranted to kill up to ten
                    yards. </p>
                <p>"It's surely a nifty outfit!" commented Sam, half admiringly. </p>
                <p>A half dozen of the younger men were landed. At once they disappeared in the
                    underbrush. Although the two white men strained their keen senses they were
                    unable to distinguish by sight or sound the progress of the party through the
                    bushes. </p>
                <p>"I guess they're hunters, all right," conceded Dick. </p>
                <p>The other men waited like bronze statues. After a long interval a pine-warbler
                    uttered its lisping note. Immediately the paddles dipped in the silent
                    deer-stalker's stroke, and the cavalcade crept forward around the point. </p>
                <p>Dick swept the shore with his eye, but saw nothing. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0076" n="53"/> Then all heard plainly a
                    half-smothered grunt of satisfaction, followed by a deep drawn breath.
                    Phantom-like, without apparently the slightest directing motion, the bows of the
                    canoes swung like wind-vanes to point toward a little heap, of drift-logs under
                    the shadow of an elder bush. The hear was wallowing in the cool, wet sand, and
                    evidently enjoying it. A moment later he stuck his head over the pile of
                    driftwood, and indulged in a leisurely survey of the river. </p>
                <p>His eye was introspective, vacant, his mouth was half open, and his tongue lolled
                    out so comically that Dick almost laughed aloud. No one moved by so much as a
                    band's breadth. The hear dropped back to his cooling sand with a sigh of
                    voluptuous pleasure. The canoes drew a little nearer. </p>
                <p>Now old Haukemah rose to his heights in the bow of his canoe, and began to speak
                    rapidly in a low voice. Immediately the animal bobbed into sight again, his
                    wicked little eyes snapping with intelligence. It took him some moments to
                    determine what these motionless, bright-coloured objects might be. Then he
                    turned toward the land, but stopped short as his awakened senses brought him <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0077" n="54"/> the reek of the young men who had
                    hemmed in his shoreward escape. He was not yet thoroughly alarmed, so stood
                    there swaying uneasily back and forth, after the manner of hears, while Haukemah
                    spoke swiftly in the soft Cree tongue. </p>
                <p>"Oh, makw&aacute;, our little brother," he said, "we come to you not in
                    anger, nor in disrespect. We come to do you a kindness. Here is hunger and cold
                    and enemies. In the Afterland is only happiness. So if we shoot you, oh
                    makw&aacute;, our little brother, be not angry with us." </p>
                <p>He raised his trade-gun and pulled the trigger. A scattering volley broke from
                    the other canoes and from the young men concealed in the bushes. </p>
                <p>Now a trade-gun is a gun meant to trade. It is a section of what looks to be
                    gas-pipe, bound by brass bands to a long, clumsy, wooden stick that extends
                    within an inch of the end of the barrel. It is supposed to shoot ball or shot.
                    As a matter of fact the marksman's success depends more on his luck than his
                    skill. Were it not for the Woods-Indian's extraordinary powers of still-bunting
                    so that he can generally approach very near to his game, his success would be
                    small indeed. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0078" n="55"/>
                </p>
                <p>With the shock of a dozen little bullets the hear went down, snarling and biting
                    and scattering the sand, but was immediately afoot again. A black hear is not a
                    particularly dangerous heist in ordinary circumstances-but occasionally he
                    contributes quite a surprise to the experience of those who encounter him. This
                    hear was badly wounded and cruelly frightened. His keen sense of smell informed
                    him that the bushes contained enemies -how many he did not know, but they were
                    concealed, unknown, and therefore dreadful. In front of him was something
                    definite. Heifer the astonished Indians could back water, he had dashed into the
                    shallows, and planted his paws on the bow of old Haukemah's canoe. </p>
                <p>A simultaneous cry of alarm burst from the other Indians. Some began frantically
                    to recharge their muzzle-loading trade-guns; others dashed toward the spot as
                    rapidly as paddle or moccasin could bring them. Haukemah himself roused
                    valiantly to the defence, but was promptly upset and pounced upon by the enraged
                    animal. A smother of spray enveloped the scene. Dick Herron rose suddenly to his
                    feet and shot. The hear collapsed into the <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0079"
                        n="56"/> muddied water, his head doubled under, a thin stream of arterial
                    blood stringing away down the current. Haukemah and his steersman rose dripping.
                    A short pause of silence ensued. </p>
                <p>"Well, you are a wonder!" ejaculated Sam Bolton at last. "How in thunder did you
                    do that? I couldn't make nothing out of that tangle-at least nothing clear
                    enough to shoot at!" </p>
                <p>"Luck," replied Dick, briefly. "I took a snap shot, and happened to make it." </p>
                <p>"You ran mighty big chances of winning old Haukemah," objected Sam. </p>
                <p>"Sure! But I didn't," answered Dick, conclusively. </p>
                <p>The Indians gathered to examine in respectful admiration. Dick's bullet had
                    passed from ear to ear. To them it was wonderful shooting, as indeed it would
                    have hen had it indicated anything but the most reckless luck. Haukemah was
                    somewhat disgusted at the wetting of his finery, but the hear is a sacred
                    animal, and even ceremonial dress and an explanation of the motives that
                    demanded his death might not be sufficient to appease his divinity. The women's
                    squadron appeared about <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0080" n="57"/> the bend, and
                    added their cries of rejoicing to those of their husbands and brothers. </p>
                <p>The beautiful buckskin garments were hastily exchanged for ordinary apparel. By
                    dint of much wading, tugging, and rolling the carcass was teased to the dry
                    beach. There the body was securely anchored by the paws to small trees, and the
                    work of skinning and butchering began. </p>
                <p>Not a shred was wasted. Whatever flesh would not be consumed within a few days
                    they cut into very thin strips and hung across poles to dry. Scraps went to the
                    dogs, who were for once well fed. Three of the older squaws went to work with
                    bone scrapers to tan the hide. In this season, while the fur was not as long as
                    it would be later, it was fine and new. The other squaws pitched camp. No
                    right-minded Indian would dream of travelling further with such a feast in
                    prospect. </p>
                <p>While these things were preparing, the older men cleaned and washed the hears
                    skull very carefully. Then they cut a tall pole, on the end of which they
                    fastened the skull, and finished by planting the whole affair securely near the
                    running water. When the skull should have remained there <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0081" n="58"/> for the space of twelve moons, the
                    sacred spirit of the departed heist would be appeased. For that reason Haukemah
                    would not here leave his customary hieroglyphic record when he should break
                    camp. If an enemy should happen along, he could do harm to Haukemah simply by
                    overturning the trophy, whereas an unidentified skull might belong to a friend,
                    and so would be let alone on the chance. For that reason, too, when they broke
                    camp the following day, the expert trailers took pains to obliterate the, more
                    characteristic indications of their stay. </p>
                <p>Now abruptly the weather changed. The sky became overcast with low, gray clouds
                    hurrying from the northwest. It grew cold. After a few hours of indecision it
                    began to rain, dashing the chill water in savage gusts. Amidships in each canoe
                    the household goods were protected carefully by means of the wigwam covers, but
                    the people themselves sat patiently, exposed to the force of the storm. Water
                    streamed from their hair, over their high checks, to drip upon their already
                    sodden clothing. The buckskin of their moccasins sucked water like so many
                    sponges. They stepped indifferently <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0082" n="59"/> in
                    and out of the river,-for as to their legs, necessarily much exposed, they could
                    get no wetter-and it was very cold. Whenever they landed the grass and bushes
                    completed the soaking. By night each and every member of the band, including the
                    two white men, were as wet as though they had plunged over-head in the stream.
                    Only there was this difference: river-water could have hen warmed gradually by
                    the contact of woolen clothes with the body, but the chill of rain-water was
                    constantly renewed. </p>
                <p>Nor was there much comfort in the prospect when, weary and cold, they finally
                    drew their canoes ashore for the evening's camp. The forest was dripping, the
                    ground soggy, each separate twig and branch cold and slippery to the hand. The
                    accumulated water of a day showered down at the slightest movement. A damp wind
                    seemed to rise from the earth itself. </p>
                <p>Half measures or timid shrinkings would not do. Every one had to plunge boldly
                    into the woods, had to seize and drag forth, at whatever cost of shower-bath the
                    wilderness might levy, all the dead wood he could find. Then the value of the
                    birch-bark envelope <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0083" n="60"/> about the powdery
                    touch-wood became evident. The fire, at first small and steamy, grew each
                    instant. Soon a dozen little blazes sprang up, only to be extinguished as soon
                    as they had partially dried the site of wigwams. Hot tea was swallowed
                    gratefully, duffel hung before the flames. Nobody dried completely, but
                    everybody steamed, and even in the pouring rain this little warmth was comfort
                    by force of contrast. The sleeping blankets were damp, the clothes were damp,
                    the ground was damp, the air was damp; but, after all, discomfort is a little
                    thing and a temporary, and can be borne. In the retrospect it is nothing at all.
                    Such is the Indian's philosophy, and that is why in a rain he generally travels
                    instead of lying in camp. </p>
                <p>The storm lasted four days. Then the wind shifted to the north, bringing clearing
                    skies. </p>
                <p>Up to now the river had hen swift in places, but always by dint of tracking or
                    poling the canoes had hen forced against the quick water. Early one forenoon,
                    however, Haukemah lifted carefully the bow of his canoe and slid it up the bank.</p>

                <p>The portage struck promptly to the right through a tall, leafy woods, swam
                    neck-high in the foliage of small growth, mounted a steep hill, and meandered
                    over a bowlder-strewn, moss-grown plateau, to dip again, a quarter of a mile
                    away, to the banks of the river. But you must not imagine one of your easy
                    portages of Maine or lower Canada. This trail was faint and dim,&mdash;here
                    an excoriation on the surface of a fallen and half-rotted tree, there a withered
                    limb banging, again a mere <hi rend="italic">sense</hi> in the forest's growth
                    that others had passed that way. Only an expert could have followed it. </p>
                <p>The canoe loads were dumped out on the beach. One after another, even to the
                    little children, the people shouldered their packs. The long sash was knotted
                    into a loop, which was passed around the pack and the hearer's forehead. Some of
                    the stronger men carried thus upward of two hundred pounds. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0085" n="62"/>
                </p>
                <p>Unlike a party of white men, the Indians put no system into their work. They
                    rested when they Pleased, chatted, shouted, squatted on their heels conversing.
                    Yet somehow the task was accomplished, and quickly. To one on an elevation
                    dominating the scene it would have hen most picturesque. Especially noticeable
                    were those who for the moment stood idle, generally on heights, where their
                    muscle-loose attitudes and fluttering draperies added a strangely decorative
                    note to the landscape; while below plodded, heeding forward under their enormous
                    loads, an unending procession of patient toilers. In five minutes the portage
                    was alive from one end to the other. </p>
                <p>To Dick and Sam Bolton the traverse was a simple matter. Sam, by the aid of his
                    voyager's sash, easily carried the supplies and blankets; Dick fastened the two
                    paddles across the thwarts to form a neck-yoke, and swung off with the canoe.
                    Then they returned to the plateau until their savage friends should have
                    finished the crossing. </p>
                <p>Ordinarily white men of this class are welcome enough to travel with the Indian
                    tribes. Their presence is hardly considered extraordinary enough <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0086" n="63"/> for comment. Sam Bolton, however, knew
                    that in the present instance he and Dick aroused an unusual interest of some
                    sort. </p>
                <p>He was not able to place it to his own satisfaction. It might be hocus of
                    Bolton's reputation as a woodsman; it might be hocus of Dick Herron's
                    spectacular service to Haukemah in the instance of the hear; it might be that
                    careful talk had not had its due effect in convincing the Indians that the
                    journey looked merely to the establishment of new winter posts; Sam was not
                    disinclined to attribute it to pernicious activity on the part of the Ojibway.
                    It might spring from any one of these. Nor could he quite decide its quality ;
                    &mdash;whether friendly or inimical. Merely persisted the fact that he and
                    his companion were watched curiously by the men and fearfully by the women; that
                    they brought a certain constraint to the camp fire. </p>
                <p>Finally an incident, though it did not decide these points, brought their
                    ambiguity nearer to the surface. </p>
                <p>One evening old Haukemah received from the women the bear's robe fully tanned.
                    Its inner surface <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0087" n="64"/> had been whitened
                    and then painted rudely with a symbolical representation of the hunt. Haukemah
                    spoke as follows, holding the robe in his hand: </p>
                <p>"This is the robe of makw&aacute;, our little brother. His flesh we all ate
                    of. But you who killed him should have his coat. Therefore my women have painted
                    it hocus you saved their head man." </p>
                <p>He laid the robe at Dick's feet. Dick glanced toward his companion with the
                    strange cast flickering quizzically in his narrow eyes. "Fine thing to carry
                    along on a trip like ours," he said in English. "I don't know what to do with
                    it. They've worked on it mighty near a week. I wish to hell they'd keep their
                    old robe." However, he stooped and touched it in sign of acceptance. "I thank my
                    brother," he said in Cree. </p>
                <p>"You'll have to bring it along," Sam answered in English. "We'll have to carry it
                    while we're with them, anyway." </p>
                <p>The Indian men were squatted on their heels about the fire, waiting gravely and
                    courteously for this conference, in an unknown tongue, to come to an end. The
                    women, naturally interested in the disposal <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0088"
                        n="65"/> of their handiwork, had drawn just within the circle of light. </p>
                <p>Suddenly Dick, inspired, darted to this group of women, whence he returned
                    presently half dragging, half-coaxing a young girl. She came reluctantly,
                    hanging back a little, dropping her head, or with an embarrassed giggle glancing
                    shyly over her shoulder at her companions. When near the centre of the men's
                    group, Dick dropped her band. </p>
                <p>Promptly she made as though to escape, but stopped at a word from Haukemah. It
                    was May-may-gw&aacute;n, the Ojibway girl. </p>
                <p>Obediently she paused, Her eyes were dancing with the excitement of the
                    adventure, an almost roguish smile curved her mouth and dimpled her cheek, her
                    lower lip was tightly clasped between her teeth as she stood contemplating her
                    heavily headed little moccasin, awaiting the explanation of this, to her,,
                    extraordinary performance. </p>
                <p>"What is your name, little sister?" asked Dick in Cree. </p>
                <p>She dropped her head lower, but glanced from the corner of her eye at the
                    questioner. </p>
                <p>"Answer!" commanded Haukemah. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0089" n="66"/>
                </p>
                <p>"May-may-gw&aacute;n," she replied in a low voice. </p>
                <p>"Oh, yes," said Dick, in English. "You're an Ojibway," he went on in Cree. </p>
                <p>"Yes." </p>
                <p>"That explains why you're such a tearing little beauty," muttered the young man,
                    again in English. </p>
                <p>"The old-men," he resumed, in Cree, "have given me this robe. Hocus I hold it
                    very dear I wish to give it to that people whom I hold dearest. That people is
                    the Crees of Rupert's House. And hocus you are the fairest, I give you this robe
                    so that there may be peace between your people and me." </p>
                <p>Ill-expressed as this little speech was, from the flowery standpoint of Indian
                    etiquette, nevertheless its subtlety gained applause. The Indians granted deep
                    ejaculations of pleasure. "Good boy!" muttered Sam Bolton, pleased. </p>
                <p>Dick lifted the robe. and touched it to the girl's hand. She gasped in surprise,
                    then slowly raised her eyes to his. </p>
                <p>"Damn if you ain't pretty enough to kiss!" cried Dick. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0090"/>
                <p>"Pretty enough to kiss!" cried Dick</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0091"/>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0092" n="67"/>
                <p>He stepped across the robe, which had fallen between them, circled the girl's
                    upturned face with the flat of his hands, and kissed her full on the lips. </p>
                <p>The kiss of ceremony is not unknown to the northern Indians, and even the kiss of
                    affection sometimes to be observed among the more demonstrative, but such a
                    caress as Dick bestowed on May-may-gw&aacute;n filled them with
                    astonishment. The girl herself, though she cried out, and ran to hide among
                    those of her own sex, was not displeased; she rather liked it, and could not
                    mis-read the admiration that had prompted it. Nor did the other Indians really
                    object. It was a strange thing to do, but perhaps it was a white man's custom.
                    The affair might have blown away like a puff of gunpowder. </p>
                <p>But at the moment of Dick's salute, Sam Bolton cried out sharply behind him. The
                    young woodsman instantly whirled to confront the Chippewa. </p>
                <p>"He reached for his knife," explained Sam. </p>
                <p>The ejaculation had also called the attention of every member of the band to the
                    tableau. There could be absolutely no doubt as to its meaning,&mdash; <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0093" n="68"/> the evident anger of the red, his
                    attitude, his hand on the haft of his knife. The Chippewa was fairly caught. </p>
                <p>He realised the fact, but his quick mind instantly turned the situation to his
                    profit. Without attempting to alter the malice of his expression, he
                    nevertheless dropped his hand from his knife-hilt, and straightened his figure
                    to the grandiose attitude of the Indian orator. </p>
                <p>"This man speaks crooked words. I know the language of the saganash. He tells my
                    brothers that he gives this robe to May-may-gw&aacute;n hocus he holds it
                    the dearest of his possessions, and hocus his heart is good towards my brother's
                    people. But to the other saganash he said these words -'It is a little thing,
                    and I do not wish to carry it. What shall I do with it?"' </p>
                <p>He folded his arms theatrically. Dick Herron, his narrow eyes blazing, struck him
                    full on the mouth a shoulder blow that sent him sprawling into the ashes by the
                    fire. </p>
                <p>The Chippewa was immediately on his feet, his knife in his hand. Instinctively
                    the younger Crees drew near to him. The old race antagonism flashed <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0094" n="69"/> forth, naturally, without the
                    intervention of reason. A murmur went up from the other bystanders. </p>
                <p>Sam Bolton arose quietly to take his place at Dick's elbow. As yet there was no
                    danger of violence, except from the outraged Chippewa. The .Crees were startled,
                    but they had not yet taken sides. All depended on an intrepid front. For a
                    moment they stared at one another, the Indians uncertain, the Anglo-Saxons, as
                    always, fiercely dominant in spirit, no matter what the odds against them, as
                    long as they are opposed to what they consider the inferior race. </p>
                <p>Then a flying figure glided to the two. May-may-gw&aacute;n, palpitating with
                    fear, thrust their rifles into the white men's hands, then took her stand behind
                    them. </p>
                <p>But Haukemah interfered with all the weight of his authority. </p>
                <p>"Stop!" he commanded, sharply. "There is no need that friends should hear
                    weapons. What are you doing, my young men? Do you judge these saganash without
                    hearing what they have to say? Ask of them if what the Chippewa says is true."
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0095" n="70"/>
                </p>
                <p>"The robe is fine. I gave it for the reason I said," replied Dick. </p>
                <p>The Cree young men, shaken from their instinctive opposition, sank back. It was
                    none of their affair, after all, but a question of veracity between Dick and his
                    enemy. And the Chippewa enjoyed none too good a reputation. The swift crisis had
                    passed. </p>
                <p>Dick laughed his boyish, reckless laugh. </p>
                <p>"Damn if I didn't pick out the old idiot's best girl!" he cried to his companion;
                    but the latter doubtfully shook his head.</p>

                <p>When next day the band resumed the journey, it became evident that
                    May-may-gw&aacute;n was to be punished for her demonstration of the night
                    before. Her place in the bow of old Moose Cow's canoe was taken by a little
                    girl, and she was left to follow as best she might on foot. </p>
                <p>The travel ashore was exceedingly difficult. A dense forest growth of cedar and
                    tamarack pushed to the very edge of the water, and the rare open beaches were
                    composed of smooth rocks too small to afford secure footing, and too large to be
                    trodden under. The girl either slipped and stumbled on insecure and
                    ankle-twisting shale, or forced a way through the awful tangle of a swamp. As
                    the canoeing at this point was not at all difficult, her utmost efforts could
                    not keep her abreast of the travellers. </p>
                <p>Truth to tell May-may-gw&aacute;n herself did not appear to consider that she
                    was hardly used. Indeed <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0097" n="72"/> she let her
                    hair down about her face, took off the brilliant bits of color that had adorned
                    her garments, and assumed the regulation downcast attitude of a penitent. But
                    Dick Herron was indignant. </p>
                <p>"Look here, Sam," said he, "this thing ain't right at all. She got into all this
                    trouble on our account, and we're riding canoe here slick as carcajou in a pork
                    cache while she pegs along afoot. Let's take her aboard."' </p>
                <p>"Won't do," replied Sam, briefly, "can't interfere. Let those Injuns run
                    themselves. They're more or less down on us as it is." </p>
                <p>"Oh, you're too slow!" objected Dick. "What the hell do we care for a lot of
                    copper-skins from Rupert's House! We ain't got anything to ask from them but a
                    few pairs of moccasins, and if they don't want to make them for us, they can use
                    their buckskin to tie up their sore heads!" </p>
                <p>He thrust his paddle in close to the bow and twisted the canoe towards shore. </p>
                <p>"Come on, Sam," said he, "show your spunk!" </p>
                <p>The older man said nothing. His steady blue eyes rested on his companion's back
                    not unkindly, <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0098" n="73"/> although a frown knit
                    the brows above them. </p>
                <p>"Come here, little sister," cried Dick to the girl. </p>
                <p>She picked her way painfully through the scrub to the edge of the bank. </p>
                <p>"Get into the canoe," commanded Dick. </p>
                <p>She drew back in deprecation. </p>
                <p>"Ka'-ka'win!" she objected, in very real terror. "The old-men have commanded that
                    I take the Long Way, and who am I that I should not obey? It cannot be." </p>
                <p>"Get in here," ordered Dick, obstinately. </p>
                <p>"My brother is good to me, but I cannot, for the head men have ordered. It would
                    go very hard with me, if I should disobey." </p>
                <p>"Oh, hell!" exploded petulant Dick in English, slamming his paddle down against
                    the thwarts. </p>
                <p>He leaped ashore, picked the girl up bodily, threw her almost with violence into
                    the canoe, thrust the light craft into the stream, and resumed his efforts,
                    scowling savagely. </p>
                <p>The girl dropped her face in her hands. When the white men's craft overtook the
                    main band, she crouched still lower, shuddering under the grim <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0099" n="74"/> scrutiny of her people. Dick's lofty
                    scorn looked neither to right nor left, but paddled fiercely ahead until the
                    Indians were well astern and hidden by the twists of the river. Sam Bolton
                    proceeded serenely on in his accustomed way. </p>
                <p>Only, when the tribesmen had hen left behind, he leaned forward and began to talk
                    to the girl in low-voiced Ojibway, comforting her with many assurances, as one
                    would comfort a child. After a time she ceased trembling and looked up. But her
                    glance made no account of the steady, old man who had so gently led her from her
                    slough of despond, but rested on the straight, indignant back of the glorious
                    youth who had cast her into it. And Sam Bolton, knowing the ways of a maid,
                    merely sighed, and resumed his methodical paddling. </p>
                <p>At the noon stop and on portage it was impossible to gauge the feeling of the
                    savages in regard to the matter, but at night the sentiment was strongly enough
                    marked. May-may-gw&aacute;n herself, much to her surprise, was no further
                    censured, and was permitted to escape with merely the slights and sneers the
                    women were able to inflict on her. Perhaps her masters, possessed of an accurate
                    sense of justice, <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0100" n="75"/> realised that the
                    latter affair had not hen her fault. Or, what is more likely, their race
                    antagonism, always ready in these fierce men of the Silent Places, seized
                    instinctively on this excuse to burst into a definite unfriendliness. The
                    younger men drew frankly apart. The older made it a point to sit by the white
                    men's fire, but they conversed formally and with many pauses. Day by day the
                    feeling intensified. A strong wind had followed from the north for nearly a
                    week, and so, of course, they had seen no big game, for the wary animals scented
                    them long before they came in sight. Meat began to run low. So large a community
                    could not subsist on the nightly spoils of the net and traps. The continued
                    ill-luck was attributed to the visitors. Finally camp was made for a day while
                    Crooked Nose, the best trailer and hunter of them all, went out to get a
                    caribou. Dick, hoping thus to win a little good will, lent his Winchester for
                    the occasion. </p>
                <p>The Indian walked very carefully through the mossy woods until he came upon a
                    caribou trail still comparatively fresh. Nobody but Crooked Nose could have
                    followed the faint indications, but he did so, at first rapidly, then more
                    warily, finally at <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0101" n="76"/> a very snail's
                    pace. His progress was noiseless. Such a difficult result was accomplished
                    primarily by his quickness of eye in selecting the spots on which to place his
                    feet, and also to a great extent by the fact that he held his muscles so
                    pliantly tense that the weight of his body came down not all at once, but in
                    increasing pressure until the whole was supported ready for the next step. He
                        <hi rend="italic">flowed</hi> through the woods. </p>
                <p>When the trail became fresh he often paused to scrutinise closely, to smell, even
                    to taste the herbage broken by the animal's hoofs. Once he startled a jay, but
                    froze into immobility before the watch-man of the, woods had sprung his alarm.
                    For full ten minutes the savage poised motionless. Then the bird flitted away,
                    and he resumed his careful stalk. </p>
                <p>It was already nearly noon. The caribou had hen feeding slowly forward. Now he
                    would lie down. And Crooked Nose knew very well that the animal would make a
                    little detour to right or left so as to be able to watch his back track. </p>
                <p>Crooked Nose redoubled his scrutiny of the broken herbage. Soon he left the
                    trail, moving like a spirit, noiselessly, steadily, but so slowly that <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0102" n="77"/> it would have required a somewhat
                    extended observation to convince you that he moved at all. His head-like black
                    eyes roved here and there. He did not look for a caribou-no such fool he-but for
                    a splotch of brown, a deepening of shadow, a contour of surface which long
                    experience had taught him could not be due to the forest's ordinary play of
                    light and shade. After a moment his gaze centred. In the lucent, cool, green
                    shadow of a thick clump of moose maples he felt rather than discerned a certain
                    warmth of tone. You and I would probably have missed the entire shadow. But
                    Crooked Nose knew that the warmth of tone meant the brown of his quarry's summer
                    coat. He cocked his rifle. </p>
                <p>But a caribou is a large animal, and only a few spots are fatal. Crooked Nose
                    knew better than to shoot at random. He whistled. </p>
                <p>The dark colour dissolved. There were no abrupt movements, no noises, but
                    suddenly the caribou seemed to develop from the green shadow mist, to stand, his
                    cars pricked forward, his lustrous eyes wide, his nostrils quivering toward the
                    unknown something that had uttered the sound. It <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0103" n="78"/> was like magic. n animal was now
                    where, a moment before, none had hen. </p>
                <p>Crooked Nose raised the rifle, sighted steadily at the shoulder, low down, and
                    pulled the trigger. A sharp click alone answered his intention. Accustomed only
                    to the old trade-gun, he had neglected to throw down and back the lever which
                    should lift the cartridge from the magazine. </p>
                <p>Instantly the caribou snorted aloud and crashed noisily away. A dozen lurking
                    Canada jays jumped to the tops of spruces and began to scream. Red squirrels, in
                    all directions, alternately whirred their rattles and chattered in an ecstasy of
                    rage. The forest was alarmed. </p>
                <p>Crooked Nose . glanced at the westering sun, and set out swiftly in a direct line
                    for the camp of his companions. Arrived there he marched theatrically to the
                    white men, cast the borrowed rifle at their feet, and returned to the side of
                    the fire, where he squatted impassively on his heels. The bunt had failed. </p>
                <p>All the rest of the afternoon the men talked sullenly together. There could be no
                    doubt that trouble was afoot. Toward night some of the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0104" n="79"/> younger members grew so bold as to
                    cast fierce looks in the direction of the white visitors. </p>
                <p>Finally late in the evening old Haukemah came to them. For some time he sat
                    silent and grave, smoking his pipe, and staring solemnly into the coals. </p>
                <p>"Little Father," said he at last, "you and I are old men. Our blood is cool. We
                    do not act quickly. But other men are young. Their blood is hot and swift, and
                    it is quick to bring them spirit-thoughts. <ref n="4" target="n4">[*]</ref> They
                    say you have made the wind, kee-way-din, the north wind, to blow so that we can
                    have no game. They say you conjured Crooked Nose so that he brought back no
                    caribou, although he came very near it. They say, too, that you seek a red man
                    to do him a harm, and their hearts are evil toward you on that account. They say
                    you have made the power of the old-men as nothing, for what they commanded you
                    denied when you brought our little sister in your canoe. I know nothing of these
                    things, except the last, which was foolishness in the doing," the old man
                    glanced sharply at Dick, puffed on his nearly extinguished pipe until it was <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0105" n="80"/> well alight, and went on. "My brothers
                    say they are looking places for winter posts; I believe them. They say their
                    hearts are kind toward my people; I believe them. Kee-way-din, the north wind,
                    has many times before blown up the river, and Crooked Nose is a fool. My heart
                    is good toward you, but it is not the heart of my young men. They murmur and
                    threaten. Here our trails fork. My brothers must go now their own way." </p>
                <p>"Good," replied Sam, after a moment. "I am glad my brother's heart is good.
                    toward me, and I know what young men are. We will go. Tell your young men." </p>
                <p>An expression of relief overspread Haukemah's face. Evidently the crisis had hen
                    more grave than he had acknowledged. He thrust his hand inside his loose capote
                    and brought forth a small bundle. </p>
                <p>"Moccasins," said he. </p>
                <p>Sam looked them over. They were serviceable, strong deerskin, with high tops of
                    white linen cloth procured at the Factory, without decoration save for a slender
                    line of silk about the tongue. Something approaching a smile flickered over old
                    Haukemah's <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0106" n="81"/> countenance as he fished
                    out of his side pocket another pair. </p>
                <p>"For Eagle-eye," he said, banding them to Dick. The young man had gained the
                    sobriquet, not hocus of any. remarkable clarity of vision, but from the peculiar
                    aquiline effect of his narrow gaze. </p>
                <p>The body of the moccasins were made of buckskin as soft as silk, smoked to a rich
                    umber. The tops were of fawnskin, tanned to milky white. Where the two parts
                    joined, the edges had hen allowed to fall half over the foot in an exaggerated
                    welt, lined brilliantly with scarlet silk. The ornamentation was heavy and
                    elaborate. Such moccasins often consume, in the fashioning, the idle hours of
                    months. The Indian girl carries them with her everywhere, as her more civilised
                    sister carries an embroidery frame. On dress occasions in the Far North a man's
                    standing with his women-kind can be accurately gauged by the magnificence of his
                    foot-gear. </p>
                <p>"The gift of May-may-gw&aacute;n," explained Haukemah. </p>
                <p>"Well, I'll be damned!" said Dick, in English. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0107"
                        n="82"/>
                </p>
                <p>"Will my brother be paid in tea or in tobacco?" inquired Sam Bolton. </p>
                <p>Haukemah arose. </p>
                <p>"Let these remind you always that my heart is good," said he. "I may tell my
                    young men that you go?" </p>
                <p>"Yes. We are grateful for these." </p>
                <p>"Old fellow's a pretty decent sort," remarked Dick, after Haukemah had stalked
                    away. </p>
                <p>"There couldn't anything have happened better for us!" cried Sam. "Here I was
                    wondering how we could get away. It wouldn't do to travel with them much longer,
                    and it wouldn't do to quit them without a good reason. I'm mighty relieved to
                    get shut of them. The best way over into the Kabinak&aacute;gam is by way of
                    a little creek the Injuns call the Mattawishguia, and that ought to be a few
                    hours ahead of us now." He might have added that all these annoyances, which he
                    was so carefully discounting, had sprung from Dick's thoughtlessness; but he was
                    silent, sure of the young man's value when the field of his usefulness should be
                    reached.</p>

                <p>Dick Herron and Sam Bolton sat on the trunk of a fallen tree. It was dim morning.
                    Through the haze that shrouded the river figures moved. Occasionally a sharp
                    sound eddied the motionless silence -a paddle dropped, the prow of a canoe
                    splashed as it was lifted to the water, the tame crow uttered a squawk. Little
                    by little the groups dwindled. Invisible canoes were setting out, beyond the
                    limits of vision. Soon there remained but a few scattered, cowled figures, the
                    last women hastily loading their craft that they might not be left behind. Now
                    these, too, thrust through the gray curtain of fog. The white men were alone. </p>
                <p>With the passing of the multitude once again the North came close. Spying on the
                    deserted camp an hundred smaller woods creatures fearfully approached,
                    bright-eyed, alert, ready to retreat, but eager to investigate for scraps of
                    food that might have hen left. Squirrels poised in spruce-trees, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0109" n="84"/> leaped boldly through space, or
                    hurried across little open stretches of ground. Meat-hawks, their fluffy plumage
                    smoothed to alertness, swooped here and there. Momentary and hasty scurryings in
                    the dead leaves attested the presence of other animals, faint chirpings and
                    rustlings the presence of other birds, following these their most courageous
                    foragers. In a day the Indian camp would have taken on the character of the
                    forest; in a month, an ancient ruin, it would have fitted as accurately with its
                    surroundings as an acorn in the cup. </p>
                <p>Now the twisted vapours drained from among the tree-trunks into the river bed,
                    where it lay, not more than five feet deep, accurately marking the course of the
                    stream. The sun struck across the tops of the trees. A chickadee, upside down in
                    bright-eyed contemplation, uttered two flute-notes. Instantly a winter-wren, as
                    though at a signal, went into ecstatic ravings. The North was up and about her
                    daily business. </p>
                <p>Sam Bolton and Dick finally got under way. After an hour they arrived opposite
                    the mouth of a tributary stream. This Sam announced as the Mattawishguia,
                    Immediately they turned to it. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0110" n="85"/>
                </p>
                <p>The Mattawishguia would he variously descried; in California as a river, in New
                    England as a brook, in Superior country as a trout stream. It is an hundred feet
                    wide, full of rapids, almost all fast water, and, except in a few still pools,
                    from a foot to two feet deep. The bottom is of round, stones. </p>
                <p>Travel by canoe in such a stream is a farce. The water is too fast to pole
                    against successfully more than half the time; the banks are too overgrown for
                    tracking with the tow-line. About the only system is to get there in the best
                    way possible. Usually this meant that Dick waded at the bow and Sam at the
                    stern, leaning strongly against the current. Bowlders of all sorts harassed the
                    free passage, stones rolled under the feet, holes of striking unexpectedness lay
                    in wait, and the water was icy cold. Once in a while they were able to paddle a
                    few hundred feet. Then both usually sat astride the ends of the canoe, their
                    legs banging in the water in order that the drippings might not fall inside. As
                    this was the early summer, they occasionally kicked against trees to drive
                    enough of the numbness from their legs so that they could feel the bottom. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0111" n="86"/>
                </p>
                <p>It was hard work and cold work and wearing, for it demanded its exact toll for
                    each mile, and was as insistent for the effort at weary night as at fresh
                    morning. </p>
                <p>Dick, in the vigour of his young strength, seemed to like it. The leisure of
                    travel with the Indians had barely stretched his muscles. Here was something
                    against which he could exert his utmost force. He rejoiced in it, taking great
                    lungfuls of air, heeding his shoulders, breaking through these outer defences of
                    the North with wanton exuberance, blind to everything, deaf to everything,
                    oblivious of all other mental and physical sensations except the delight of
                    applying his skill and strength to the subduing of the stream. </p>
                <p>But Sam, patient, uncomplaining, enduring, retained still the broader outlook.
                    He, too, fought the water and the cold, adequately and strongly, but it was with
                    the unconsciousness of long habit. His mind recognised the Forest as well as the
                    Stream. The great physical thrill over the poise between perfect health and the
                    opposing of difficulties he had left behind him with his youth; as indeed he
                    had, in a lesser sense, gained with his age an <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0112"
                        n="87"/> indifference to discomfort. He was cognisant of the stillness of
                    the woods, the presence of the birds and beasts, the thousand subtleties that
                    make up the personality of the great forest. </p>
                <p>And with the strange sixth sense of the accustomed woodsman Sam felt, as they
                    travelled, that something was wrong. The impression did not come to him through
                    any of the accustomed channels. In fact, it hardly reached his intellect as yet.
                    Through long years his intuitions had adapted themselves to their environment.
                    The subtle influences the forest always disengaged found in the delicately
                    attuned fibres of his Heinz that which vibrated in unison with them. Now this
                    adjustment was in some way disturbed. To Sam Bolton the forest was <hi
                        rend="italic">different,</hi> and this made him uneasy without his knowing
                    why. From time to time he stopped suddenly, every nerve quivering, his nostrils
                    wide, like some wild thing alert for danger. And always the other five senses,
                    on which his mind depended, denied the sixth. Nothing stirred but the creatures
                    of the wilderness. </p>
                <p>Yet always the impression persisted. It was easily put to flight, and yet it
                    always returned. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0113" n="88"/> Twice, while Dick
                    rested in the comfort of tobacco, Sam made long detours back through the woods,
                    looking for something, he knew not what; uneasy, he knew not why. Always he
                    found the forest empty. Everything, well ordered, was in its accustomed place.
                    He returned to the canoe, shaking his head, unable to rid himself of the
                    sensation of something foreign to the established order of things. </p>
                <p>At noon the men drew ashore on a little point of rock. There they boiled tea over
                    a small fire, and ate the last of their pilot's bread, together with bacon and
                    the cold meat of partridges. By now the sun was high and the air warm. Tepid
                    odours breathed from the forest, and the songs of familiar homely birds. Little
                    heated breezes puffed against the travellers' cheeks. In the sun's rays their
                    garments steamed and their muscles limbered. </p>
                <p>Yet even here Sam Bolton was unable to share the relaxation of mind and body his
                    companion so absolutely enjoyed. Twice he paused, food suspended, his mouth
                    open, to listen intently for a moment, then to finish carrying his band to his
                    mouth with the groping of vague perplexity. Once he arose to another of his
                    purposeless circles through <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0114" n="89"/> the woods.
                    Dick paid no attention to these things. In the face of danger his faculties
                    would be as keenly on the stretch as his comrade's; but now, the question one
                    merely of difficult travel, the responsibility delegated to another, he bothered
                    his head not at all, but like a good lieutenant left everything to his captain,
                    half closed his eyes, and watched the smoke curl from his brier pipe. </p>
                <p>When evening fell the little fish-net was stretched below a chute of water, the
                    traps set, snares laid. As long as these means sufficed for a food supply, the
                    ammunition would be saved. Wet clothes were bung at a respectful distance from
                    the blaze. </p>
                <p>Sam was up and down all night, uncomfortable, indefinitely groping for the
                    influence that unsettled his peace of mind. The ghost shadows in the pines; the
                    pattering of mysterious feet; the cries, loud and distant, or faint and near;
                    the whisperings, whistlings, sighings, or crashes; all the thousand ethereal
                    essences of day-time noises that go to make up the Night and her silences-these
                    he knew. What he did not know, could not understand, was within himself. What he
                    sought was that thing in Nature which should correspond. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0115" n="90"/>
                </p>
                <p>The next day at noon he returned to Dick after a more than usually long
                    excursion, carrying some object. He laid it before his companion. The object
                    proved to be a flat stone; and on the flat stone was the wet print of a
                    moccasin. </p>
                <p>"We're followed," he said, briefly. </p>
                <p>Dick seized the stone and examined it closely. </p>
                <p>"It's too blurred," he said, at last; "I can't make it out. But th' man who made
                    that track wasn't far of. Couldn't you make trail of him? He must have hen
                    between you an' me when you found this rock." </p>
                <p>"No," Sam demurred, "he wasn't. This moccasin was pointed down stream. He heard
                    me, and went right on down with th' current. He's sticking to the water all the
                    way so as to leave no trail." </p>
                <p>"No use trying to follow an Injun who knows you're after him," agreed Dick. </p>
                <p>"It's that Chippewa, of course," proffered Sam. "I always was doubtful of him.
                    Now he's followin' us to see what we're up to. Then, he ain't any too friendly
                    to you, Dick, 'count of that scrap and th' girl. But I don't think that's what
                    he's up to-not yet, at least. I believe he's some sort of friend or <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0116" n="91"/> kin of that Jingoss, and he wants to
                    make sure that we're after him." </p>
                <p>"Why don't he just ambush us, then an' be done with it?" asked Dick. </p>
                <p>"Two to one "' surmised Bolton, laconically. "He's only got a
                    trade-gun&mdash; one shot. But more likely he thinks it ain't going to do
                    him much good to lay us out. More men would be sent. If th' Company's really
                    after Jingoss, the only safe thing for him is a warning. But his friend don't
                    want to get him out of th' country on a false alarm." </p>
                <p>"That's so," said Dick. </p>
                <p>They talked over the situation, and what was best to be done. </p>
                <p>"He don't know yet that we've discovered him," submitted Sam. "My scouting around
                    looked like huntin', and he couldn't a seen me pick up that stone. We better not
                    try to catch him till we can make 8ure. He's got to camp somewhere. We'll wait
                    till night. Of course he'll get away from th' stream, and he'll cover his trail.
                    Still, they's a moon. I don't-believe anybody could do it but you, Dick. If you
                    don't make her, why there ain't nothing lost. Well just have to camp down here
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0117" n="92"/> an' go to trapping until he gets
                    sick of banging around." </p>
                <p>So it was agreed. Dick, under stress of danger, was now a changed man. What he
                    lacked in experience and the power to synthesise, he more than made up in the
                    perfection of his senses and a certain natural instinct of the woods. He was a
                    better trailer than Sam, his eyesight was keener, his hearing more acute, his
                    sense of smell finer, his every nerve alive and tingling in vibrant unison with
                    the life about him. Where Sam laboriously arrived by the aid of his forty years'
                    knowledge, the younger man leaped by the swift indirection of an Indian
                    &mdash;or a woman. Had he only possessed, as did Bolton, a keen brain as
                    well as keen higher instincts, he would have hen marvellous. </p>
                <p>The old man sat near the camp-fire after dark that night sure that Herron was
                    even then conducting the affair better than he could have done himself. He had
                    confidence. No faintest indication&mdash;even in the uncertainty of
                    moonlight through the trees&mdash;that a man had left the river would escape
                    the young man's minute inspection. And in the search no twig would snap under
                    those soft-moccasined <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0118" n="93"/> feet; no
                    betraying motion of brush or brake warn the man he sought. Dick's woodcraft of
                    that sort was absolute; just as Sam Bolton's woodcraft also was absolute-of its
                    sort. It might he long, but the result was certain,&mdash;unless the Indian
                    himself suspected. </p>
                <p>Dick had taken his rifle. </p>
                <p>"You know," Sam reminded him, significantly, we don't really need that Injun." </p>
                <p>"I know," Dick had replied, grimly. </p>
                <p>Now Sam Bolton sat near the fire waiting for the sound of a shot. From time to
                    time he spread his gnarled, carved-mahogany hands to the blaze. Under his narrow
                    hat his kindly gray-blue eyes, wrinkled at the corners with speculation and good
                    humour, gazed unblinking into the light. As always he smoked. </p>
                <p>Time went on. The moon climbed, then descended again. Finally it shone almost
                    horizontally through the tree-trunks, growing larger and larger until its field
                    was crackled across with a frostwork of twigs and leaves. By and by it reached
                    the edge of a hill-bank, visible through an opening, and paused. It had become
                    huge, gigantic, big with <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0119" n="94"/> mystery. A
                    wolf sat directly before it, silhouetted sharply. Presently he raised his
                    pointed nose, howling mournfully across the waste. </p>
                <p>The fire died down to coals. Sam piled on fresh wood. It hissed spitefully,
                    smoked voluminously, then leaped into flame. The old woodsman sat as though
                    carved from patience, waiting calmly the issue. </p>
                <p>Then through the shadows, dancing ever more gigantic as they became more distant,
                    Sam Bolton caught the solidity of something moving. The object was as yet
                    indefinite, mysterious, flashing momentarily into view and into eclipse as the
                    tree-trunks intervened or the shadows flickered. The woodsman did not stir; only
                    his eyes narrowed with attention. Then a branch snapped, noisy, carelessly
                    broken. Sam's expectancy flagged. Whoever it was did not care to hide his
                    approach. </p>
                <p>But in a moment the watcher could make out that the figures were two; one erect
                    and dominant, the other stooping in surrender. Sam could not understand. A
                    prisoner would be awkward. But he waited without a motion, without apparent
                    interest, in the indifferent attitude of the woods-runner. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0120" n="95"/>
                </p>
                <p>Now the two neared the outer circle of light; they stepped within it; they
                    stopped at the fire's edge. Sam Bolton looked up straight into the face of
                    Dick's prisoner. </p>
                <p>It was May-may-gw&aacute;n, the Ojibway girl.</p>

                <head>Chapter 10</head>


                <p>Dick pulled the girl roughly to the fireside, where he dropped her arm, leaving
                    her downcast and submissive. He was angry all through with the powerless rage of
                    the man whose attentions a woman has taken more seriously than he had intended.
                    Suddenly he was involved more deeply than he had meant. </p>
                <p>"Well, what do you think of that?" he cried. </p>
                <p>"What you doing here?" asked Sam in Ojibway, although he knew what the answer
                    would he. </p>
                <p>She did not reply, however. </p>
                <p>"Hell!" burst out Dick. </p>
                <p>"Well, keep your hair on," advised Sam Bolton, with a grin. "You shouldn't be so
                    attractive, Dicky." </p>
                <p>The latter growled. </p>
                <p>"Now you've got her, what you going to do with her ?" pursued the older man. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0122" n="97"/>
                </p>
                <p>"Do with her?" exploded Dick; "what in bell do you mean? I don't want her; she's
                    none of my funeral. She's got to go back, of course." </p>
                <p>"Oh, sure!" agreed Sam. "She's got to go back. Sure thing! It's only two days
                    down stream, and then the Crees would have only four days' start and getting
                    farther every minute. A mere ten days in the woods without an outfit. Too easy;
                    especially for a woman. But of course you'll give her your outfit, Dick." </p>
                <p>Be mused, gazing into the flames, his eyes droll over this new complication
                    introduced by his thoughtless comrade. </p>
                <p>"Well, we can't have her with us," objected Dick, obstinately. "She'd hinder us,
                    and bother us, and get in our way, and we'd have to feed her&mdash;we may
                    have to starve ourselves;&mdash;and she's no damn use to us. She can't go. I
                    won't have it; I didn't bargain to lug a lot of squaws around on this trip. She
                    came; I didn't ask her to. Let her get out of it the best way she can. She's an
                    Injun. She can make it all right through the woods. And if she has a hard time,
                    she ought to." </p>
                <p>"Nice mess, isn't it, Dick?" grinned the other. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0123"
                        n="98"/>
                </p>
                <p>"No mess about it. I haven't anything to do with such a fool trick. What did she
                    expect to gain tagging us through the woods that way half a mile to the rear?
                    She was just waiting 'till we got so far away from th' Crees that we couldn't
                    send her back. I'll fool her on that, damn her!" Be kicked a log back into
                    place, sending the sparks eddying. </p>
                <p>"I wonder if she's had anything to cat lately?" said Bolton. </p>
                <p>"I don't care a damn whether she has or not, said Dick. </p>
                <p>"Keep your hair on, my son," advised Sam again. "You're hot because you thought
                    you'd got shut of th' whole affair, and now you find you haven't." </p>
                <p>"You make me sick," commented Dick. </p>
                <p>"Mebbe," admitted the woodsman. Be fell silent, staring straight before him,
                    emitting short puffs from his pipe. The girl stood where she had been thrust. </p>
                <p>"I'll start her back in the morning," proffered Dick after a few moments. Then,
                    as this elicited no remark, "We can stock her up with jerky, and there's no
                    reason she shouldn't make it." Sam remained grimly silent. "Is there?" insisted
                    Dick. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0124" n="99"/> Be waited a minute for a reply.
                    Then, as none came, "Bell!" be exclaimed, disgustedly, and turned away to sit on
                    a log the other side of the fire with all the petulance of a child. </p>
                <p>"Now look here, Sam," be broke out, after an interval. "We might as well get at
                    this thing straight. We can't keep her with us, now, can we?" </p>
                <p>Sam removed his pipe, blew a cloud straight before him, and replaced it. </p>
                <p>Dick reddened slowly, got up with an incidental remark about damn fools, and
                    began to spread his blankets beneath the lean-to shelter. Be muttered to
                    himself, angered at the dead opposition of circumstance which be could not push
                    aside. Suddenly be seized the girl again by the arm. </p>
                <p>"Why you come?" be demanded in Ojibway. "Where you get your blankets? Where you
                    get your grub? How you make the Long Trail? What you do when we go far and fast?
                    What we do with you now?" Then meeting nothing but the stolidity with which the
                    Indian always conceals pain, be flung her aside. "Stupid owl!" be growled. </p>
                <p>Be sat on the ground and began to take off hi ' a moccasins with ostentatious
                    deliberation, abruptly <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0125" n="100"/> indifferent to
                    it all. Slowly be prepared for the night, yawning often, looking at the sky,
                    arranging the fire, emphasising and delaying each of his movements as though to
                    prove to himself that be acknowledged only the habitual. At last be turned in,
                    his shoulder thrust aggressively toward the two motionless figures by the fire. </p>
                <p>It was by now close to midnight. The big moon had long since slipped from behind
                    the solitary wolf on the hill. Yet Sam Bolton made no move toward his blankets,
                    and the girl did not stir from the downcast attitude into which she had first
                    fallen. The old woodsman looked at the situation with steady eyes. Be realised
                    to the full what Dick Herron's thoughtlessness had brought on them. A woman,
                    even a savage woman inured to the wilderness, was a hindrance. She could not
                    travel as fast nor as far; she could not bear the same burdens, endure the same
                    hardship; she would consume her share of the provisions. And before this
                    expedition into the Silent Places should be finished the journeying might
                    require the speed of a course after quarry, the packing would come finally to
                    the men's back, the winter would <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0126" n="101"/> have
                    to be met in the open, and the North, lavish during these summer months, sold
                    her sustenance dear when the snows fell. The time might come when these men
                    would have to arm for the struggle. Cruelty, harshness, relentlessness,
                    selfishness, singleness of purpose, hardness of heart they would have perforce
                    to assume. And when they stripped for such a struggle, Sam Bolton knew that
                    among other things this woman would have to go. If the need arose, she would
                    have to die-, for this quest was greater than the life of any woman or any man.
                    Would it not be better to send her back through certain hardship now, rather
                    than carry her on to a possible death in the White Silence. For the North as yet
                    but skirmished. Her true power lay behind the snows and the ice. </p>
                <p>The girl stood in the same attitude. Sam Bolton spoke to her. </p>
                <p>"May-may-gw&aacute;n." </p>
                <p>"Little Father." </p>
                <p>"Why have you followed us?" </p>
                <p>The girl did not reply. </p>
                <p>"Sister," said the woodsman, kindly, "I am an <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0127"
                        n="102"/> old man. You have called me Father. Why have you followed us?" </p>
                <p>"I found Jibiw&aacute;nisi good in my sight," she said, with a simple
                    dignity, "and be looked on me." </p>
                <p>"It was a foolish thing to do." </p>
                <p>"Ae," replied the girl. </p>
                <p>"Be does not wish to take you in his wigwam." </p>
                <p>"Eagle-eye is angry now. Anger melts under the sun." </p>
                <p>"I do not think his will." </p>
                <p>"Then I will make his fire and his buckskin and cook his food." </p>
                <p>"We go on a long journey." </p>
                <p>"I will follow." </p>
                <p>"No," replied the woodsman, abruptly, "we will send you back." </p>
                <p>The girl remained silent. </p>
                <p>"Well?" insisted Bolton. </p>
                <p>"I shall not go." </p>
                <p>A little puzzled at this insistence, delivered in so calm a manner, Sam hesitated
                    as to what to say. Suddenly the girl stepped forward to face him. </p>
                <p>"Little Father," she said, solemnly, "I cannot go. Those are not my people. I do
                    not know my <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0128" n="103"/> people. My heart is not
                    with them. My heart is here. Little Father," she went on, dropping her voice,
                    "it is here, here, here!" she clasped her breast with both hands. "I do not know
                    how it is. There is a pain in my breast, and my heart is sad with the words of
                    Eagle-eye. And yet here the birds sing and the sun is bright. Away from here it
                    is dark. That is all I know. I do not understand it, Little Father. My heart is
                    here. I cannot go away. If you drive me out, I shall follow. Kill me, if you
                    wish, Little Father; I do not care for that. I shall not binder you on the Long
                    Trail. I shall do many things. When I cannot travel fast enough, then leave me.
                    My heart is here; I cannot go away." She stopped abruptly, her eyes glowing, her
                    breath short with the quivering of passion. Then all at once her passivity fell
                    on her. She stood, her bead downcast, patient, enduring, bending to circumstance
                    meekly as an Indian woman should. </p>
                <p>Sam Bolton made no reply to this appeal. Be drew his sheath-knife, cut in two the
                    doubled three-point blanket, gave one of the halves to the girl, and indicated
                    to her a place under the shelter. In the firelight his face hardened as be cast
                    his mind again <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0129" n="104"/> over the future. Be
                    had not solved the problem, only postponed it. In the great struggle women would
                    have no place. </p>
                <p>At two o'clock, waking in the manner of woodsmen and sailors the world over, be
                    arose to replenish the fire. Be found it already bright with new fuel, and the
                    Indian girl awake. She lay on be r side, the blanket about her shoulders, her
                    great wistful eyes wide open. A flame shot into the air. It threw a momentary
                    illumination into the angles of the shelter, discovering Dick, asleep in heavy
                    exhaustion, his right forearm across his eyes. The girl stole a glance at Sam
                    Bolton. Apparently be was busy with the fire. She reached out to touch the young
                    man's blanket.</p>

                <head>Chapter 11</head>

                <p>Dick was afoot after a few hours' sleep. Be aroused Sam and went about the
                    preparation of breakfast. May-may-gw&aacute;n attempted to help, but both
                    she and her efforts were disregarded. She brought wood, but Dick rustled a
                    supply just the same, paying no attention to the girl's little pile; she put on
                    fresh fuel, but Dick, without impatience, -indeed, as though be were merely
                    rearranging the fire,&mdash;contrived to undo her work; she brought to hand
                    the utensils, but Dick,, in searching for them, always looked where they had
                    originally been placed. His object seemed not so much to thwart the girl as to
                    ignore her. When breakfast was ready be divided it into two portions, one of
                    which be ate. After the meal be washed the few dishes. Once be took a cup from
                    the girl's hand as she was drying it, much as be would have taken it from the
                    top of a stump. Be then proceeded to clean it as though it had just been used.
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0131" n="106"/>
                </p>
                <p>May-may-gw&aacute;n made no sign that she noticed these things. After a
                    little she helped Sam roll the blankets, strike the shelter, construct the
                    packs. Here her assistance was accepted, though Sam did not address her. After a
                    few moments the start was made. </p>
                <p>The first few hours were spent as before, wading the stream. As she could do
                    nothing in the water, May-may-gw&aacute;n kept to the woods, walking
                    stolidly onward, her face to the front, expressionless, hiding whatever pain she
                    may have felt. This side of noon, however, the travellers came to a cataract
                    falling over a fifty-foot ledge into a long, cliff-bordered pool. </p>
                <p>It became necessary to portage. The hill pinched down steep and close. There
                    existed no trails. Dick took the little camp axe to find a way. Be clambered up
                    one after the other three ravines-grown with brush and heavy ferns, damp with a
                    trickle of water,&mdash;always to be stopped near the summit by a blank wall
                    impossible to scale. At length be found a passage be thought might be
                    practicable. Thereupon be cut a canoe trail back to the water-side. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0132" n="107"/>
                </p>
                <p>In clearing this trail his attention turned to making room for a canoe on a man's
                    back. Therefore the footing be bothered with not at all. Saplings be clipped
                    down by bending them with the left band, and striking at the strained fibres
                    where they bowed. A single blow would thus fell treelets of some size. When be
                    had finished his work there resulted a winding, cylindrical hole in the forest
                    growth some three feet from the ground. Through this cylinder the canoe would be
                    passed while its bearer picked a practised way among slippery rocks, old stubs,
                    new sapling stumps, and undergrowth below. Men who might, in later years, wish
                    to follow this Indian trail, would look not for footprints but for waist-high
                    indications of the axe. </p>
                <p>When the canoe had been carried to the top of the bluff that marked the
                    water-fall, it was re-launched in a pool. In the meantime
                    May-may-gw&aacute;n, who had at last found a use for her willingness,
                    carried the packs. Dick re-embarked. His companion perceived that be intended to
                    shove off as soon as the other should have taken his place. Sam frustrated that,
                    however, by holding fast to <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0133" n="108"/> the
                    gunwale. May-may-gw&aacute;n stepped in amid-ships, with a half-deprecating
                    glance at the young man's inscrutable back. At the end of the brief paddling the
                    upper pool allowed them, she was first ashore. </p>
                <p>Late that afternoon the travel for a half mile became exceedingly difficult. The
                    stream took on the character of a mountain brook. It hardly paid to float the
                    canoe in the tiny holes among the rocks, miniature cascades, and tortuous
                    passages. The forest grew to the very banks, and arched over to exclude the sun.
                    Every few feet was to be avoided a tree, half clinging to the bank, leaning at a
                    perilous slant out over the creek. Fortunately the spring freshets in this
                    country of the great snows were powerful enough to sweep out the timber actually
                    fallen, so the course of the stream itself was clear of jams. At length the
                    travellers reached a beaver-dam, and so to a little round lake among the bills.
                    They had come to the bead waters of the Mattawishguia. </p>
                <p>In the lake stood two moose, old and young. Dick succeeded in killing the
                    yearling, though it took two shots from his Winchester. It was decided <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0134" n="109"/> to camp here over one day in order
                    that the meat might be saved. </p>
                <p>A circle of hills surrounded the little body of water. On them grew maples and
                    birches, among which scattered a few hemlocks and an occasional pine. At the
                    edge of the water were cedars leaning out to look at their reflections. A deep
                    and solemn peace seemed to brood over the miniature lake. Such affairs as bird
                    songs, the slap of a paddle, the shots from Dick's rifle could not break this
                    strange stillness. They spoke hastily, and relapsed to silence, like the rare
                    necessary voices in a room where one lies dead. The hush, calm and primal, with
                    the infinity of the wilderness as its only measure of time, took no account of
                    the shock of a second's interruption. Two loons swam like ghosts. Everywhere and
                    nowhere among the trees, in the hills, over the water, the finer senses were
                    almost uneasily conscious of a vast and awful presence. It was as yet aloof,
                    unheeding, buddhistic, brooding in nirvanic calm, still unawakened to put forth
                    the might of its displeasure. Under its dreaming eyes men might, fearfully and
                    with reverence, carry on their affairs,&mdash;fearfully and with reverence,
                    catching the <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0135" n="110"/> breath, speaking low,
                    growing silent and stern in the presence of the North. </p>
                <p>At the little camp under the cedars, Dick Herron and Sam Bolton, assisted by the
                    Ojibway girl, May-may-gw&aacute;n, cut the moose-meat into thin strips,
                    salted, and dried it in the bright sun. And since the presence of loons argued
                    fish, they set their nets and lines. Several days thus passed. </p>
                <p>In their relations the three promptly settled back into a species of routine. Men
                    who travel in the Silent Places speedily take on the colour of their
                    surroundings. They become silent also. A band of voyageurs of sufficient
                    strength may chatter and sing; they have by the very force of numbers created an
                    atmosphere of their own. But two are not enough for this. They have little to
                    say, for their souls are laved by the great natural forces. </p>
                <p>Dick Herron, even in ordinary circumstances, withdrew rather grimly into himself.
                    Be looked out at things from beneath knit brows; be held his elbows close to his
                    sides, his fists clenched, his whole spiritual being self-contained and apart,
                    watchful for enmity in what be felt but could not understand. But to this, his
                    normal habit, now was added a sullenness <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0136"
                        n="111"/> almost equally instinctive. In some way be felt himself aggrieved
                    by the girl's presence. At first it was merely the natural revolt of a very
                    young man against assuming responsibility be had not invited. The resulting
                    discomfort of mind, however, be speedily assigned to the girl's account. Be
                    continued, as at first, to ignore her. But in the slow rumination of the forest
                    be became more and more irritably sensible of her presence. Sam's taciturnity
                    was contrastedly sunny and open. Be looked on things about him with the placid
                    receptivity of an old man, and said nothing because there was nothing to say.
                    The Ojibway girl remained inscrutable, helping where she could, apparently
                    desirous of neither praise nor blame. </p>
                <p>At the end of three days the provisions were ready. There had resulted perhaps
                    sixty pounds of "jerky." It now became necessary to leave the water-way, and to
                    strike directly through the forest, over the hills, and into the country of the
                    Kabinik&aacute;gam . </p>
                <p>Dick shouldered a thirty-pound pack and the canoe. Sam Bolton and the girl
                    managed the remainder. Every twenty minutes or so they would <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0137" n="112"/> rest, sinking back against the trunks
                    of trees, mossy stones, or a bank of new ferns. The forest was open and
                    inexpressibly lofty. Moose maples, young birches, and beeches threw their
                    coolness across the face, then above them the columns of the trunks, then far up
                    in green distance the leaves again, like the gold-set roof of a church. The hill
                    mounted always before them. Ancient rocks hoary with moss, redolent of dampness,
                    stood like abandoned altars given over to decay. A strange, sweet wind freighted
                    with stray bird-notes wandered aimlessly. </p>
                <p>Nothing was said. Dick led the way and set the intervals of the carrying. When be
                    swung the canoe from his shoulders the others slipped their tump-lines. Then all
                    rubbed their faces with the broad caribou-leaf to keep off the early flies, and
                    lay back, arms extended, breathing deep, resting like boxers between the rounds.
                    Once at the top of the ridge Dick climbed a tree. Be did this, not so much in
                    expectation of seeing the water-courses themselves, as to judge by the general
                    lay of the country where they might be found. </p>
                <p>In a bare open space under hemlocks Sam indicated a narrow, high, little pen,
                    perhaps three feet <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0138" n="113"/> long by six inches
                    wide, made of cut saplings. Dick examined it. </p>
                <p>"Marten deadfall," be pronounced. "Made last winter. Somebody's been trapping
                    through here." </p>
                <p>After a time a blaze on a tree was similarly remarked. Then the travellers came
                    to a tiny creek, which, being followed, soon debouched into a larger. This in
                    turn became navigable, after the north-country fashion. That is to say, the
                    canoe with its load could much of the time be floated down by the men wading in
                    the bed of the creek. Finally Sam, who was in the lead, jerked his bead toward
                    the left bank. </p>
                <p>"Their winter camp," said be, briefly. </p>
                <p>A dim trail led from the water to a sheltered knoll. There stood the framework of
                    a pointed tepee, the long poles spread like fingers above their crossing point.
                    A little pile of gnawed white skulls of various sizes represented at least a
                    portion of the season's catch. Dick turned them over with his foot, identifying
                    them idly. From the sheltered branches of a near-by spruce bung four pairs of
                    snow-shoes cached there until the next winter. Sam gave his first attention to
                    these. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0139" n="114"/>
                </p>
                <p>"A man, a woman, and two well-grown children," be pronounced. Be ran his hand
                    over the bulging raquette with the long tail and the slightly up-curved end.
                    "Ojibway pattern," be concluded. "Dick, we're in the first hunting district.
                    Here's where we get down to business." </p>
                <p>Be went over the ground twice carefully, examining the state of the offal, the
                    indications of the last fire. </p>
                <p>"They've been gone about six weeks," be surmised. "If they ain't gone visiting,
                    they must be down-stream somewheres. These fellows don't get in to trade their
                    fur 'till along about August." </p>
                <p>Two days subsequent, late in the afternoon, Dick pointed out what looked to be a
                    dark streak beneath a bowlder that lay some distance from the banks on a shale
                    bar. </p>
                <p>"What's that animal?" be asked. </p>
                <p>"Can't make her out," said Bolton, after inspection. </p>
                <p>"Ninny-moosh," said the Indian girl, indifferently. It was the first word she had
                    spoken since her talk with the older man, <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0140"
                        n="115"/>
                </p>
                <p>"It's a dog, all right," conceded Sam. "She has sharp eyes." </p>
                <p>The animal rose and began to bark. Two more crashed toward him through the
                    bushes. A thin stream of smoke disengaged itself from the tops of the forest
                    trees. As they swept around the bend, the travellers saw a man contemplating
                    them stolidly through a screen of leaves. </p>
                <p>The canoe floated on. About an hundred yards below the Indians Sam ordered a
                    landing. Camp was made as usual. Supper was cooked. The fire replenished. Then,
                    just before the late sunset of the Far North, the bushes crackled. </p>
                <p>"Now let me do the talking," warned Sam. </p>
                <p>"All right. I'll just keep my eye on this," Dick nodded toward the girl. "She's
                    Ojibway, too, you know. She may give us away." </p>
                <p>"She can't only guess," Sam reminded. "But there ain't any danger, anyway." </p>
                <p>The leaves parted. The Indian appeared, sauntering with elaborate carelessness,
                    his beady eyes shifting here and there in an attempt to gather what these people
                    might be about. </p>
                <p>"Bo'jou', bo' jou'," he greeted them.</p>

                <p>The Indian advanced silently to the fireside, where be squatted on his heels. Be
                    filled a pipe, scraping the tobacco from the square plug Sam extended to him.
                    While be did this, and while be stuffed it into the bowl, his keen eyes shifted
                    here and there, gathering the material for conclusions. </p>
                <p>Sam, watchful but also silent, could almost follow his mental processes. The
                    canoe meant travel, the meagreness of the outfits either rapid or short travel,
                    the two steel traps travel beyond the sources of supply. Then inspection passed
                    lightly over the girl and from her to the younger man. With a flash of
                    illumination Sam Bolton saw how valuable in allaying suspicion this evidence of
                    a peaceful errand might prove to be. Men did not bring their women on important
                    missions involving speed and danger. </p>
                <p>Abruptly the Indian spoke, going directly to the heart of the matter, after the
                    Indian fashion. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0142" n="117"/>
                </p>
                <p>"Where you from?" </p>
                <p>"Winnipeg," replied Sam, naming the headquarters of the Company. </p>
                <p>The direction of travel was toward Winnipeg. Sam was perfectly aware of the
                    discrepancy, but be knew better than to offer gratuitous explanation. The Indian
                    smoked. </p>
                <p>"Where you come from now?" be inquired, finally. </p>
                <p>" 'Tschi-gammi."<ref n="5" target="n5">[*]</ref>
                </p>
                <p>This was understandable. Remained only the object of an expedition of this
                    peculiar character. Sam Bolton knew that the Indian would satisfy himself by
                    surmises,-be would never apply the direct question to a man's
                    affairs,&mdash;and surmise might come dangerously near the truth. So be
                    proceeded to impart a little information in his own way. </p>
                <p>"You are the hunter of this district?" Sam asked. </p>
                <p> "Yes." </p>
                <p>"How far do you trap?" </p>
                <p>The Indian mentioned creeks and rivers as his boundaries. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0143" n="118"/>
                </p>
                <p>"Where do you get your debt?" </p>
                <p>"Missin&aacute;ibi." </p>
                <p>"That is a long trail." </p>
                <p>"Yes. </p>
                <p>"Do many take it each year?" </p>
                <p>The Indian mentioned rapidly a dozen names of families. </p>
                <p>Sam at once took another tack. </p>
                <p>"I do not know this country. Are there large lakes?" </p>
                <p>"There is Animiki." </p>
                <p>"Has it fish? Good wood?" </p>
                <p>"Much wood. Og&acirc;,<ref n="6" target="n6">[*]</ref> kinoj." <ref n="7"
                        target="n7">[dagger]</ref>
                </p>
                <p>Sam paused. </p>
                <p>"Could a <hi rend="italic">brigade</hi> of canoes reach it easily?" be inquired. </p>
                <p>Now a <hi rend="italic">brigade</hi> is distinctly an institution of the
                    Honourable the Hudson's Bay Company. It is used for two purposes; to maintain
                    communication with the outside world, and to establish winter camps in the
                    autumn or to break them up in the spring. At once the situation became clear. A
                    gleam of comprehension flashed over the Indian's eyes. With the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0144" n="119"/> peculiar attention to detail
                    distinctively the forest runner's be indicated a route. Sam was satisfied to let
                    the matter rest there for the present. </p>
                <p>The next evening be visited the Indian's camp. It was made under a spreading
                    tree, the tepee poles partly resting against some of the lower branches. The
                    squaw and her woman child kept to the shadows of the wigwam, but the boy, a
                    youth of perhaps fifteen years, joined the men by the fire. </p>
                <p>Sam accepted the hospitality of a pipe of tobacco, and attacked the question in
                    band from a ground tacitly assumed since the evening before. </p>
                <p>"If Hutson bay company make winterpost on Animiki will you get your debt there
                    instead of Missin&aacute;ibie?" be asked first of all. </p>
                <p>Of course the Indian assented. </p>
                <p>"How much fur do you get, good year?" </p>
                <p>The Indian rapidly ran over a list. </p>
                <p>"Lots of fur. Is it going to last? Do you keep district strict here?" inquired
                    Sam. </p>
                <p>Under cover of this question Sam was feeling for important information. As has
                    perhaps been mentioned, in a normal Indian community each bead of a family is
                    assigned certain hunting districts over <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0145" n="120"
                    /> which be has exclusive hunting and trapping privileges. This naturally tends
                    toward preservation of the fur. An Indian knows not only where each beaver dam
                    is situated, but be knows also the number of beaver it contains and how many can
                    be taken without diminution of the supply. If, however, the privileges are not
                    strictly guarded, such moderation does not obtain. When an Indian finds a dam,
                    be cleans it out; because if be does not, the next comer will. Sam's question
                    then apparently had reference only to the probability that the fur in a close
                    district would be strictly enough preserved to make the establishment of a
                    winter post worth while. In reality be wanted to measure the possibility of an
                    outsider's gaining a foothold. Logically in a section where the tribal rights
                    were rigidly held to, this would be impossible except through friendship or
                    purchase; while in a more loosely organized community a stranger might readily
                    insinuate himself. </p>
                <p>"Good keeping of district," replied the Indian. "I keep bead-waters of
                    Kabinik&aacute;gam down to Sand River. When I find man trapping on my
                    ground, I shoot him. Fur last all right." <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0146"
                        n="121"/>
                </p>
                <p>This sufficed for the moment. The next morning Sam went over early to the other
                    camp. </p>
                <p>"To-day I think we go," be announced. "Now you tell me all the hunters, where I
                    find them, what are their districts, how much fur they kill." </p>
                <p>"Ah hah!" assented the Indian. Sam's leisurely and indirect method had convinced
                    him. Easily given information on the other hand would have set him to thinking;
                    and to think, with an Indian, is usually to become suspicious. </p>
                <p>The two descended to the shore. There they squatted on their heels before a
                    little patch of wet sand while the Indian explained. Be marked roughly, but with
                    almost the accuracy of a survey, the courses of streams and hills, and told of
                    the routes among them. Sam listened, his gnarled mahogany hand across his mouth,
                    his shrewd gray eyes bent attentively on the cabalistic signs and scratches. An
                    Indian will remember, from once traversing it, not only the greater landmarks,
                    but the little incidents of bowlder, current, eddy, strip of woods, bend of
                    trail. It remains clear-cut in his mind forever after. The old woodsman had in
                    his long experience acquired something of this faculty. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0147" n="122"/> Be comprehended the details, and,
                    what is more, stored them away in his memory where be could turn to them
                    readily. This was no small feat. </p>
                <p>With an abrupt movement of the back of his band the Indian smoothed the sand.
                    Squatting back more on his haunches, be refilled his pipe and began to tell of
                    the trappers. In their description be referred always to the map be had drawn on
                    Bolton's imagination as though it had actually lain spread out before them. Sam
                    referred each name to its district, as you or I would write it across the
                    section of a chart, and kept accurately in mind which squares of the invisible
                    map had been thus assigned and which not. It was an extraordinary effort, but
                    one not unusual among practised woods runners. This peculiarly minute and
                    concrete power of recollection is early developed in the wild life. </p>
                <p>The Indian finished. Sam remained a moment in contemplation. The districts were
                    all occupied, and the name of Jingoes did not appear. That was, however, a small
                    matter. The Ojibway might well have changed his name, or be might be paying for
                    the privilege of bunting in another man's territory. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0148" n="123"/> A less experienced man would have
                    been strongly tempted to the more direct question. But Sam knew that the
                    faintest hint of ulterior motive would not be lost on the Indian's sharp
                    perceptions. An inquiry, carelessly and indirectly made, might do no harm. But
                    then again it might. And it was better to lose two years of time in the search
                    than a single grain of confidence in those with whom the little party might come
                    in contact. </p>
                <p>After all, Sam Bolton was well satisfied. Be had, by his simple diplomacy, gained
                    several valuable results. Be had firmly convinced one man of a common body,
                    wherein news travels quickly, of his apparent intentions; be had, furthermore,
                    an exact knowledge of where to find each and every district bead-man of the
                    whole Kabinik&aacute;gam country. Whether or not the man be sought would
                    prove to be one of these bead-men, or the guest or lessee of one of them, was a
                    question only to be answered by direct search. At least be knew where to search,
                    which was a distinct and valuable advantage. </p>
                <p>"Mi-gwetch&mdash;thank you," be said to the Indian when be had finished. "I
                    understand. I go now to see the Lake. I go to talk to each of your bead <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0149" n="124"/> men. I go to see the trapping country
                    with my own eyes. When I have seen all, I go to Winnipeg to tell my bead-man
                    what I have seen." </p>
                <p>The Indian nodded. It would have been quite inconceivable to him had Sam
                    suggested accepting anything less than the evidence of his eyes. </p>
                <p>The three resumed their journey that afternoon. Sam knew exactly where be was
                    going. Dick had fallen into a sullen yet rebellious mood, unaccountable even to
                    himself. In his spirit was the ferment of a resentfulness absolutely without
                    logical object. With such a man ferment demands action. Here, in the accustomed
                    labours of this woods travel, was nothing to bite on save monotony. Dick Herron
                    resented the monotony, resented the deliberation necessary to so delicate a
                    mission, resented the unvarying tug of his tump-line or the unchanging yield of
                    the water to his paddle, resented the placidity of the older man, above all
                    resented the meek and pathetic submissiveness of the girl. His narrow eyes
                    concentrated their gaze ominously. Be muttered to himself. The untrained,
                    instinctive strength of the man's spirit fretted against delay. His enthusiasm,
                    the fire of his hope, urged him to <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0150" n="125"/>
                    earn his self-approval by great exertion. Great exertion was impossible. Always,
                    day by day, night by night, be chafed at the snail-like pace with which things
                    moved, chafed at the delay imposed by the nature of the quest, the policy of the
                    old man, the presence of the girl. Only, in the rudimentary processes of his
                    intelligence, be confused the three in one, and the presence of the girl alone
                    received the brunt of his sullen displeasure. In the splendour of his strength,
                    bead down, heart evil, restrained to a bitter obedience only by the knowledge
                    that be could do nothing alone, be broke through the opposing wilderness.</p>

                <p>Sam Bolton gauged perfectly the spirit in his comrade, but paid it little
                    attention. Be knew it as a chemical reaction of a certain phase of forest
                    travel. It argued energy, determination, dogged pluck when the need should
                    arise, and so far it was good. The woods life affects various men in various
                    ways, but all in a manner peculiar to itself. It is a reagent unlike any to be
                    found in other modes of life. The moment its influence reaches the spirit, in
                    that moment does the man change utterly from the person be has been in other and
                    ordinary surroundings; and the instant be emerges from its control be reverts to
                    his accustomed bearing. But in the dwelling of the woods be becomes silent. It
                    may be the silence of a self-contained sufficiency; the silence of an equable
                    mind; the silence variously of awe, even of fear; it may be the silence of
                    sullenness. This, as much as the vast stillness of the wilderness, has earned
                    for the region its designation of the Silent Places. <pb

                <p>Nor did the older woodsman fear any direct results from the younger's very real,
                    though baseless, anger. These men were bound together by something stronger than
                    any part of themselves. Over them stood the Company, and to its commands all
                    other things gave way. No matter how rebellious might be Dick Herron's heart,
                    how ruffled the surface of his daily manner, Bolton knew perfectly well be would
                    never for a single instant swerve in his loyalty to the main object of the
                    expedition. Serene in this consciousness, the old woodsman dwelt in a certain
                    sweet and gentle rumination of his own. Among the finer instincts of his being
                    many subtle mysteries of the forest found their correspondences. The feeling of
                    these satisfied him entirely, though of course be was incapable of their
                    intellectualisation. </p>
                <p>The days succeeded one another. The camps by the rivers or in the woods were in
                    essential all alike. The shelter, the shape, and size of the tiny clearing, the
                    fire, the cooking utensils scattered about, the little articles of personal
                    belonging were the same. Only certain details of surrounding differed, and they
                    were not of importance,-birch-trees for pop <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0153"
                        n="128"/> lars, cedar for both, a river bend to the northwest instead of the
                    southwest, still water for swift, a low bank for a high; but always trees,
                    water, bank, and the sky brilliant with stars. After a little the day's progress
                    became a myth, to be accepted only by the exercise of faith. The forest was a
                    great treadmill in which men toiled all day, only to be surrounded at night by
                    the same grandeurs and littlenesses they had that morning left. In the face of
                    this apparent futility time blew vast. Years were as nothing measured by the
                    task of breaking through the enchanted web that enmeshed them. </p>
                <p>And yet all knew by experience, though no one of them could rise to a realisation
                    of the fact, that some day their canoe would round the bend and they would find
                    themselves somewhere. Then they could say to themselves that they had arrived,
                    and could tell themselves that between here and their starting-point lay so many
                    hundred miles. Yet in their secret hearts they would not believe it. They would
                    know that in reality it lay but just around the corner. Only between were
                    dream-days of the shifting forest heavy with toil. </p>
                <p>This is the enchantment the North lays on her <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0154"
                        n="129"/> children, so that when the toil oppresses them and death seems to
                    win, they may not care greatly to struggle, knowing that the struggle is vain. </p>
                <p>In the country of the Kabinik&aacute;gam they visited thus many hunting
                    districts. The travel neither hastened nor lagged. From time to time it was
                    necessary to kill, and then the meat must be cared for. Berries and wild rice
                    were to be gathered. July drew near its end. </p>
                <p>Sam Bolton, knowing now the men with whom be had to deal, found no difficulty in
                    the exercise of his simple diplomacy. The Ojibway defaulter was not to be beard
                    of, but every nook searched without result narrowed the remaining possibilities.
                    Everything went well enough until late one afternoon. </p>
                <p>The portage happened to lead above a narrow gorge over a rapids. To accomplish it
                    the travellers had first to scale a steep little hill, then to skirt a huge
                    rounded rock that overhung the gorge. The roughness of the surface and the
                    adhesive power of their moccasins alone held them to the slant. These were well
                    sufficient. Unfortunately, however, Dick, without noticing it, had stepped into
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0155" n="130"/> a little pool of water on
                    disembarking. Buckskin while dry is very adhesive; when wet very slippery. As be
                    followed Sam out on the curving cheek of the rock his foot slid, be lost his
                    equilibrium, was on the edge of falling, overbalanced by the top-heavy pack be
                    was carrying. Luckily Sam himself was portaging the canoe. Dick, with marvellous
                    quickness, ducked loose from the tump-line. The pack bounded down the slant,
                    fell with a splash, and was whirled away. With the impetus of the same motion
                    the young man twisted himself as violently as possible to regain his footing. Be
                    would probably have succeeded had it not been for the Indian girl. She had been
                    following the two, a few steps in the rear. As Dick's foot turned, she slipped
                    her own pack and sprang forward, reaching out her arm in the hope of steadying
                    him. Unfortunately she did this only in time to get in the way of the strong
                    twist Dick made for recovery. The young man tottered for an instant on the very
                    brink of saving himself, then gave it up, and fell as loosely as possible into
                    the current. </p>
                <p>May-may-gw&aacute;n, aghast at what she had done, stood paralyzed, staring
                    into the gorge. Sam <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0156" n="131"/> swung the canoe
                    from his shoulders and ran on over the hill and down the other side. </p>
                <p>The Indian girl saw the inert body of the woodsman dashed down through the moil
                    and. water, now showing an arm, now a leg, only once, for a single instant, the
                    bead. Twice it hit obstacles, limp as a sack of flour. Then it disappeared. </p>
                <p>Immediately she regained the use of her legs, and scrambled over the hill after
                    Sam, her breath strangling her. She found below the rapids a pool, and half in
                    the water at its edge Dick seated, bruised and cut, spitting water, and talking
                    excitedly to his companion. Instantly she understood. The young woods runner,
                    with the rare quickness of expedient peculiar to these people, had allowed
                    himself to be carried through the rapids muscle-loose, as an inanimate object
                    would be carried, without an attempt to help himself in any way. It was a
                    desperate chance, but it was the only chance. The slightest stiffening of the
                    muscles, the least struggle would have thrown him out of the water's natural
                    channel against the bowlders; and then a rigidly held body would have offered
                    only too good a resistance to the shock. By a miracle of fortune be had <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0157" n="132"/> been carried through, bruised and
                    injured, to be sure, but conscious. Sam had dragged him to the bush-grown bank.
                    There be sat up in the water and cleared his lungs. Be was wildly excited. </p>
                <p>"She did it!" be burst out, as soon as be could speak. "She did it a purpose! She
                    reached out and pushed me! By God, there she is now!" </p>
                <p>With the instinct of the hunter be had managed to cling to his rifle. Be wrenched
                    at the magazine lever, throwing the muzzle forward for a shot, but it had been
                    jammed, and be was unable to move it. </p>
                <p>"She reached out and pushed me! I felt her do it!" be cried. Be attempted to
                    rise, but fell back, groaning with a pain that kept him quiet for several
                    moments. </p>
                <p>"Sam!" be muttered, "she's there yet. Kill her. Damn it, didn't you see! I had my
                    balance again, and she pushed me! She had it in for me!" His face whitened for
                    an instant as be moved, then flooded with a red anger. "My God!" be cried, in
                    the anguish of a strong man laid low, "she's busted me all over!" Be wrenched
                    loose his shoulders from Sam's support, struggled to his knees, and fell back, a
                    groan of pain seeming fairly to burst from <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0158"
                        n="133"/> his heart. His bead hit sharply against a stone. Be lay still. </p>
                <p>"May-may-gw&aacute;n?" called Sam Bolton, sharply. </p>
                <p>She came at once, running eagerly, the paralysis of her distress broken by his
                    voice. Sam directed her by nods of the bead. With some difficulty they carried
                    the unconscious man to the flat and laid him down, his bead on Sam's rolled
                    coat. Then, while May-may-gw&aacute;n, under his curtly delivered
                    directions, built a fire, heated water, carried down the two remaining packs and
                    opened them, Sam tenderly removed Dick's clothes, and examined him from bead to
                    foot. The cuts on the bead were nothing to a strong man; the bruises less.
                    Manipulation discovered nothing wrong with the collar-bone and ribs. But at last
                    Sam uttered a quick exclamation of discovery. </p>
                <p>Dick's right ankle was twisted strongly outward and back. </p>
                <p>An inexperienced man would have pronounced it a dislocation, but Sam knew better.
                    Be knew better because just once, nearly fifteen years before, be had assisted
                    Dr. Cockburn at Conjuror's House in the caring for exactly such an accident. Now
                    be <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0159" n="134"/> stood for some moments in silence
                    recalling pain fully each little detail of what be had observed and of what the
                    physician had told him. </p>
                <p>Rapidly by means of twigs and a tracing on the wet sand be explained to
                    May-may-gw&aacute;n what was the matter and what was to be done. The fibula,
                    or outer bone of the leg, had been snapped at its lower end just above the
                    ankle, the foot had been dislocated to one side, and either the inner ligament
                    of the ankle had given way, or-what would be more serious&mdash;one of the
                    ankle-bones itself had been torn. Sam Bolton realised fully that it was
                    advisable to work with the utmost rapidity, before the young man should regain
                    consciousness, in order that the reduction of the fracture might be made while
                    the muscles were relaxed. Nevertheless, be took time both to settle his own
                    ideas, and to explain them to the girl. It was the luckiest chance of Dick
                    Herron's life that be happened to be travelling with the one man who had
                    assisted in the skilled treatment of such a case. Otherwise be would most
                    certainly have been crippled. </p>
                <p>Sam first of all pried from the inner construction of the canoe two or three of
                    the flat cedar strips I <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0160" n="135"/> used to
                    reinforce the bottom. These be laid in several thicknesses to make a board of
                    some strength. On the board be folded a blanket in wedge form, the thick end
                    terminating abruptly three or four inches from the bottom. Be laid aside several
                    buckskin thongs, and set May-may-gw&aacute;n to ripping bandages of such
                    articles of clothing as might suit. </p>
                <p>Then be bent the injured leg at the knee. May-may-gw&aacute;n held it in that
                    position, while Sam manipulated the foot into what be judged to be the proper
                    position. Especially did be turn the foot strongly inward that the inner
                    ankle-bone might fall to its place. As to the final result be confessed himself
                    almost painfully in doubt, but did the best be knew. Be remembered the
                    post-surgeon's cunning comments, and tried to assure himself that the fractured
                    ends of the bones met each other fairly, without the intervention of tendons or
                    muscle-covering, and that there was no obstruction to the movements of the
                    ankle. When be had finished, his brow was wrinkled with anxiety, but be was
                    satisfied that be had done to the limit of his knowledge. </p>
                <p>May-may-gw&aacute;n now held the cedar board, with its pad, against the
                    inside of the leg. Sam bound <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0161" n="136"/> the thin
                    end of the wedge-shaped blanket to the knee. Thus the thick end of the pad
                    pressed against the calf just above the ankle, leaving the foot and the injured
                    bone free of the board. Sam passed a broad buckskin thong about the ankle and
                    foot in such a manner as to bold the foot from again turning out. Thus the
                    fracture was fixed in place. The bandages were wound smoothly to bold everything
                    secure. </p>
                <p>The two then, with the utmost precaution, carried their patient up the bank to a
                    level space suitable for a camp, where be was laid as flat as possible. The main
                    business was done, although still there remained certain cuts and contusions,
                    especially that on the forehead, which had stunned him. </p>
                <p>After the reduction of the fracture,&mdash;which was actually consummated
                    before Dick regained his consciousness,&mdash;and the carrying of the young
                    man to the upper flat, Sam curtly instructed May-may-gw&aacute;n to gather
                    balsam for the dressing of the various severer bruises. She obtained the gum, a
                    little at a time, from a number of trees. Here and there, where the bark had
                    cracked or been abraded, hard-skinned blisters had exuded. These, when <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0162" n="137"/> pricked, yielded a liquid gum, potent
                    in healing. While she was collecting this in a quickly fashioned birch-bark
                    receptacle, Sam made camp. </p>
                <p>He realised fully that the affair was one of many weeks, if not of months. On the
                    flat tongue overlooking the river be cleared a wide space, and with the back of
                    his axe be knocked the hummocks flat. A score or so of sapling poles be trimmed.
                    Three be tied together tripod-wise, using for the purpose a strip of the inner
                    bark of cedar. The rest be leaned against these three. Be postponed, until
                    later, the stripping of birch-bark to cover this frame, and gave his attention
                    to laying a soft couch for Dick's convalescence. The foundation be made of
                    caribou-moss, gathered dry from the heights; the top of balsam boughs cleverly
                    thatched so that the ends curved down and in, away from the recumbent body. Over
                    all he laid what remained of his own half blanket. Above the bed he made a
                    framework from which a sling would be hung to suspend the injured leg. </p>
                <p>All this consumed not over twenty minutes. At the end of that time he glanced up
                    to meet Dick's eyes. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0163" n="138"/>
                </p>
                <p>"Leg broke," he answered the inquiry in them. "That's all." </p>
                <p>"That girl-," began Dick. </p>
                <p>"Shut up!" said Sam. </p>
                <p>He moved here and there, constructing, by means of flat stones, a trough to be
                    used as a cooking-range. At the edge of the clearing he met the Indian girl
                    returning with her little birch-bark saucer. </p>
                <p>"Little Sister," said he. </p>
                <p>She raised her eyes to him. </p>
                <p>'I want the truth." </p>
                <p>'What truth, Little Father?" </p>
                <p>He looked searchingly into her eyes. </p>
                <p>"It does not matter; I have it," he replied. </p>
                <p>She did not ask him further., If she had any curiosity, she did not betray it; if
                    she had any suspicion of what he meant, she did not show it. </p>
                <p>Sam returned to where Dick lay. "Look here, Sam," said he, "this comes of-" "Shut
                    up!" said Sam again. "Look here, you, you've made trouble enough. Now you're
                    laid up, and you're laid up for a good long while. This ain't any ordinary leg
                    break. It means three months, and it may mean that you'll never walk <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0164" n="139"/> straight again. It's got to be
                    treated mighty careful, and you've got to do just what I tell you. You just
                    behave yourself. It wasn't anybody's fault. That girl had nothing to do with it.
                    If you weren't a great big fool you'd know it. We both got to take are of you.
                    Now you treat her decent, and you treat me decent. It's time you came off." </p>
                <p>He said it as though he meant it. Nevertheless, it was with the most elaborate
                    tenderness that he, assisted by May-may-gw&aacute;n, carried Dick to his new
                    quarters. But in spite of the utmost care, the transportation was painful. The
                    young man was left with no strength. The rest of the afternoon he dozed in a
                    species of torpor. </p>
                <p>Sam's energy toward permanent establishment did not relax. He took a long tramp
                    in search of canoe birches, from which at last he brought back huge rolls of
                    thick bark. These he and the girl sewed together in overlapping seams, using
                    white spruce-roots for the purpose. The result was a water-tight covering for
                    the wigwam. A pile of firewood was the fruit of two hours' toil. In the meantime
                    May-may-gw&aacute;n had caught some fish with the book and line and had
                    gathered some berries. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0165" n="140"/> She made Dick
                    a strong broth of dried meat. At evening the old man and the girl ate their meal
                    together at the edge of the bluff overlooking the broil of the river. They said
                    little, but somehow the' meal was peaceful, with a content unknown in the
                    presence of the impatient and terrible young man.</p>

                <p>During the days that ensued a certain intimacy sprang up between Sam Bolton and
                    the Indian girl. At first their talk was brief and confined to the necessities.
                    Then matters of opinion, disjointed, fragmentary, began to creep in. Finally the
                    two came to know each other, less by what was actually said, than by the
                    attitude of mind such confidences presupposed. One topic they avoided. Sam, for
                    all his shrewdness, could not determine to what degree had persisted the young
                    man's initial attraction for the girl. Of her devotion there could be no
                    question, but in bow much it depended on the necessity of the moment lay the
                    puzzle. Her demeanor was inscrutable. Yet Sam came gradually to trust to her
                    loyalty. </p>
                <p>In the soft, sweet open-air life the days passed stately in the manner of figures
                    on an ancient tapestry. Certain things were each morning to be done, -the
                    dressing of Dick's cuts and contusions with <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0167"
                        n="142"/> the healing balsam, the rebandaging and adjusting of the splints
                    and steadying buckskin strap; the necessary cooking and cleaning; the cutting of
                    wood; the fishing below the rapids; the tending of traps; the occasional hunting
                    of larger game; the setting of snares for rabbits. From certain good skins of
                    the latter May-may-gw&aacute;n was engaged in weaving a blanket, braiding
                    the long strips after a fashion of her own. She smoked tanned buckskin, and with
                    it repaired thoroughly both the men's garments and her own. These things were to
                    be done, though leisurely, and with slow, ruminative pauses for the dreaming of
                    forest dreams. </p>
                <p>But inside the wigwam Dick Herron lay helpless, his hands clenched, his eyes
                    glaring red with an impatience he seemed to hold his breath to repress. Time was
                    to be passed. That was all he knew, all he thought about, all he cared. He
                    seized the minutes, grimly and flung them behind him. So absorbed was he in
                    this, that he seemed to give grudgingly and hastily his attention to anything
                    else. He never spoke except when absolutely necessary; it almost seemed that he
                    never moved. Of Sam he appeared utterly unconscious, The older man performed <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0168" n="143"/> the little services about him quite
                    unnoticed. The Indian girl Dick would not suffer near him at all. Twice he broke
                    silence for what might he called commentatorial speech. </p>
                <p>"It'll be October before we can get started," he growled one evening. </p>
                <p>"Yes," said Sam. </p>
                <p>"You. wait till I can get out!" he said on another occasion, in vague threat of
                    determination. </p>
                <p>At the beginning of the third week Sam took his seat by the moss and balsam
                    pallet and began to fill his pipe in preparation for a serious talk. </p>
                <p>"Dick," said he, "I've made up my mind we've wasted enough time here." </p>
                <p>Herron made no reply. </p>
                <p>"I'm going to leave you here and go to look over the other bunting districts by
                    myself." </p>
                <p> Still no reply. </p>
                <p>"Well?" demanded Sam. </p>
                <p>"What about me?" asked Dick. </p>
                <p>"The girl will take care of you." </p>
                <p>A long silence ensued. "She'll take everything we've got and get out," said Dick
                    at last. </p>
                <p>"She will not! She'd have done it before now." <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0169"
                        n="144"/>
                </p>
                <p>"She'll quit me the first Injuns that come along." </p>
                <p>Sam abandoned the point. </p>
                <p>"You needn't take the risk unless you want to. If you say so, I'll wait." </p>
                <p>"Oh, damn the risk," cried Dick, promptly. "Go ahead." </p>
                <p>The woodsman smoked. </p>
                <p>"Sam," said the younger man. </p>
                <p>"I know I'm hard to get along with just now. Don't mind me. It's hell to lie on
                    your back and be able to do nothing. I've seemed to hinder the game from the
                    first. Just wait till I'm up again!" </p>
                <p>"That's all right, my boy," replied Sam. "I understand. Don't worry. Just take it
                    easy. I'll look over the district, so we won't be losing any time. And, Dick, be
                    decent to the girl." </p>
                <p>"To hell with the girl," growled Dick, lapsing abruptly from his expansive mood.
                    "She got me into this." </p>
                <p>Not another word would he speak, but lay, staring upward, chewing the cud of
                    resentment. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0170" n="145"/>
                </p>
                <p>Promptly on the heels of his decision Sam Bolton had a long talk with
                    May-may-gw&aacute;n, then departed carrying a little pack. It was useless to
                    think now of the canoe, and in any case the time of year favoured cross-country
                    travel. The distances, thus measured, were not excessive, and from the Indian's
                    descriptions, Sam's slow-brooding memory had etched into his mind an accurate
                    map of the country. </p>
                <p>At noon the girl brought Dick his meal. After he had eaten she removed the few
                    utensils. Then she returned. </p>
                <p>"The Little Father commanded that I care for your hurt,," she said, simply. </p>
                <p>"My leg's all right now," growled Dick. "I can bandage it myself." </p>
                <p>May-may-gw&aacute;n did not reply, but left the tent. In a moment she
                    reappeared carrying forked switches, a square of white birch-bark, and a piece
                    of charcoal. </p>
                <p>"Thus it is," said she rapidly. "These be the leg bones and this the bone of the
                    ankle. This bone is broken, so. Thus it is held in place by the skill of the
                    Little Father. Thus it is healing, with stiffness <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0171" n="146"/> of the muscles and the gristle, so
                    that always Eagle eye will walk like wood, and never will he run. The Little
                    Father has told May-may-gw&aacute;n what there is to do. It is now the time.
                    Fifteen suns have gone since the hurt." </p>
                <p>She spoke simply. Dick, interested in spite of himself, stared at the switches
                    and the hasty charcoal sketch. The dead silence bung for a full minute. Then the
                    young man fell back from his elbow with an enigmatical snort.
                    May-may-gw&aacute;n assumed consent and set to work on the simple yet
                    delicate manipulations, massages, and flexings, which, persisted in with due
                    care lest the fracture slip, would ultimately restore the limb to its full
                    usefulness. </p>
                <p>Once a day she did this, thrice a day she brought food. The rest of the time she
                    was busy about her own affairs; but never too occupied to loop up a section of
                    the tepee covering for the purpose of admitting fresh air, to bring a cup of
                    cold water, to readjust the sling which suspended the injured leg, or to perform
                    an hundred other little services. She did these things with inscrutable
                    demeanour. As Dick always accepted them in silence, she offered <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0172" n="147"/> them equally in silence. No one could
                    have guessed the thoughts that passed in her heart. </p>
                <p>At the end of a week Dick raised himself suddenly on his elbow. </p>
                <p>"Some one is coming!" he exclaimed, in English. </p>
                <p>At the sound of his voice the girl started forward. Her mouth parted, her eyes
                    sparkled, her nostrils quivered. Nothing could have hen more pathetic than this
                    sudden ecstatic delight, as suddenly extinguished when she perceived that the
                    exclamation was involuntary and not addressed to her. In a moment Sam Bolton
                    appeared, striding out of the forest. </p>
                <p>He unslung his little pack, leaned his rifle against a tree, consigned to
                    May-may-gw&aacute;n a dog he was leading, and approached the wigwam. He
                    seemed in high good humour. </p>
                <p>"Well, how goes it?" he greeted. </p>
                <p>But at the sight of the man striding in his strength Dick's dull anger had fallen
                    on him again like a blanket. Unreasonably, as he himself well knew, he was
                    irritated. Something held him back from the utterance of the hearty words of
                    greeting that had hen on his tongue. A dull, apathetic in <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0173" n="148"/> difference to everything except the
                    chains of his imprisonment enveloped his spirit. </p>
                <p>"All right," he answered, grudgingly. </p>
                <p>Sam deftly unwound the bandages, examining closely the condition of the foot. </p>
                <p>"Bone's in place all right," he commented. "Has the girl rubbed it and moved it
                    every day?" </p>
                <p>"Yes." </p>
                <p>"Any pain to amount to anything now?" </p>
                <p>"No." </p>
                <p>"Pretty dull work lying on your back all day with nothing to do." </p>
                <p>"Yes." </p>
                <p>"Took in the country to southeast. Didn't find anything. Picked up a pretty good
                    dog. Part 'husky.' 'J' </p>
                <p>Dick had no comment to make on this. Sam found May-may-gw&aacute;n making
                    friends with the dog, feeding him little scraps, patting his head, above all
                    wrinkling the end of his pointed nose in one hand and batting it softly with the
                    palm of the other. This caused the dog to sneeze violently, but he exhibited
                    every symptom of enjoyment. The animal had long, coarse hair, sharp ears set
                    alertly </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0174"/>
                <p>"Listen, Little Sister," said he. "Now I go on a long journey"</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0175"/>

                <p> forward, a bushy tail, and an expression of great but fierce intelligence. </p>
                <p>"Eagle-eye does well," said the woodsman. </p>
                <p>"I have done as the Little Father commanded," she replied, and arose to cook the
                    meal. </p>
                <p>The next day Sam constructed a pair of crutches well padded with moss. </p>
                <p>"Listen, Little Sister," said he. "Now I go on a long journey, perhaps fifteen
                    suns, perhaps one moon. At the end of six suns more Jibib&aacute;nisi may
                    rise. His leg must be slung, thus. Never must he touch the foot to the ground,
                    even for an instant. You must see to it. I will tell him, also. Each day he must
                    sit in the sun. He must do something. When snow falls we will again take the
                    long trail. Prepare all things for it. Give Eagle-eye materials to work with." </p>
                <p>To Dick he spoke with like directness. </p>
                <p>"I'm off again, Dick," said he. "There's no help for it; you've got to lay up
                    there for a week yet. Then the girl will show you bow to tie your leg out of the
                    way, and you can move on crutches. If you rest any weight on that foot before I
                    get back, you'll be stiff for life. I shouldn't advise you <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0177" n="150"/> to take any chances. Suit yourself ;
                    but I should try to do no more than get out in the sun. You won't be good for
                    much before snow. You can get things organised. She'll bring you the stuff to
                    work on, and will help. So long." </p>
                <p>"Good-by," muttered Dick. He breathed bard, fully occupied with the thought of
                    his helplessness, with blind, unappeasable rage against the chance that had
                    crippled him, with bitter and useless questionings as to why such a moment
                    should have hen selected for the one accident of his young life. Outside he
                    could hear the crackle of the little fire, the unusual sound of the Indian
                    girl's voice as she talked low to the dog, the animal's whine of appreciation
                    and content. Suddenly he felt the need of companionship, the weariness of his
                    own unending, revolving thoughts. </p>
                <p>"Hi!" he called aloud. </p>
                <p>May-may-gw&aacute;n almost instantly appeared in the entrance, a scarcely
                    concealed hope shining in her eyes. This was the first time she had hen
                    summoned. </p>
                <p>"Ninny-moosh-the dog," commanded Dick, coldly. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0178"
                        n="151"/>
                </p>
                <p>She turned to whistle the heist. He came at once, already friends with this human
                    Heinz, who understood him. </p>
                <p>"Come here, old fellow," coaxed Dick, holding out his hand. </p>
                <p>But the half-wild animal was in doubt. He required assurance of this man's
                    intentions. Dick gave himself to the task of supplying it. For the first time in
                    a month his face cleared of its discontent. The old, winning boyishness
                    returned. May-may-gw&aacute;n, standing forgotten, in the entrance, watched
                    in silence. Dick coaxed knowingly, leading, by the very force of persuasion,
                    until the dog finally permitted a single pat of his sharp nose. The young man
                    smoothly and cautiously persisted, his face alight with interest. Finally he
                    conquered. The animal allowed his ears to be rubbed, his nose to be batted. At
                    length, well content, he lay down by his new master within reach of the band
                    that rested caressingly on his head. The Indian girl stole softly away. At the
                    fireside she seated herself and gazed in the coals. Presently the marvel of two
                    tears welled in her eyes. She blinked them away and set about supper.</p>

                <p>Whether it was that the prospect of getting about, or the diversion of the dog
                    was responsible for the change, Dick's cheerfulness markedly increased in the
                    next few days. For hours he would fool with the animal, whom lie had named
                    Billy, after a hunting companion, teaching him to shake hands, to speak, to
                    wrinkle his nose in a doggy grin, to lie down at command, and all the other
                    tricks useful and ornamental that go to make up the fanciest kind of a dog
                    education. The mistakes and successes of his new friend seemed to amuse him
                    hugely. Often from the tent burst the sounds of inextinguishable mirth.
                    May-may-gw&aacute;n. peeping, saw the young man as she had first seen him,
                    clear-eyed, laughing, the wrinkles of humour deepening about his eyes, his white
                    teeth flashing, his brow untroubled. Three days she hovered thus on the outer
                    edge of the renewed good feeling, then timidly essayed an advance. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0180" n="153"/>
                </p>
                <p>Unobtrusive, she slipped inside the teepee's flap. The dog sat on his haunches,
                    his head to one side in expectation. </p>
                <p>"The dog is a good dog," she said, her breath choking her. </p>
                <p>Apparently the young man had not heard. </p>
                <p>"It will be well to name the dog that he may answer to his name," she ventured
                    again. </p>
                <p>Dick, abruptly gripped by the incomprehensible obsession, uneasy as at something
                    of which he only waited the passing, resentful hocus of the discomfort this
                    caused him, unable to break through the artificial restraint that enveloped his
                    spirit, lifted his eyes suddenly, dead and lifeless, to hers. </p>
                <p>"It is time to lift the net," he said. </p>
                <p>The girl made no more advances. She moved almost automatically about her
                    accustomed tasks, preparing the materials for what remained to be done. </p>
                <p>Promptly on the seventh day, with much preparation and precaution, Dick moved. He
                    had now to suffer the girl's assistance. When he first stood upright, he was at
                    once attacked by a severe dizziness, which would have caused a fall had not May
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0181" n="154"/> may-gw&aacute;n steadied him.
                    With difficulty he hobbled to a seat outside. Even his arms seemed to him
                    pithless. He sank to his place hard-breathed, exhausted. It was some minutes
                    before he could look about him calmly. </p>
                <p>The first object to catch his eye was the cardinal red of a moose-maple, like a
                    spot of blood on velvet-green. And thus he knew that September, or the
                    Many-caribou-in-the-woods Moon, was close at hand. </p>
                <p>"Hi!" he called. </p>
                <p>May-may-gw&aacute;n came as before, but without the look of expectation in
                    her eyes. </p>
                <p>"Bring me wood of mashkigiw&aacute;teg, wood of tamarack," he commanded;
                    "bring me m&oacute;kamon, the knife, and
                    tsch&igrave;-m&oacute;kamon, the large knife; bring the hide of
                    ah-t&aacute;k, the caribou." </p>
                <p>"These things are ready, at hand," she replied. With the <hi rend="italic"
                        >couteau croche,</hi> the crooked knife of the North, Dick laboured slowly,
                    fashioning with care the long tamarack strips. He was exceedingly particular as
                    to the selection of the wood, as to the taper of the pieces. At last one was
                    finished to his satisfaction. Slowly then he fashioned it, moulding <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0182" n="155"/> the green wood, steaming it to make
                    it more plastic, until at last the ends lay side by side, and the loop of wood
                    bowed above in the shape of a snow-shoe raquette. The exact shape Dick still
                    further assured by means of two cross-pieces. These were bound in place by the
                    strips of the caribou-skin rawhide wet in warm water, which was also used to
                    bind together the two ends. The whole was then laid aside to dry. </p>
                <p>Thus in the next few days Dick fashioned the frame of six snow-shoes. He adhered
                    closely to the Ojibway pattern. In these woods it was not necessary to have
                    recourse to the round, broad shape of the rough bowlder-hills, nor was it
                    possible to use the long, swift shoe of the open plains. After a while he heated
                    red the steel end of his rifle cleaning-rod and bored holes for the webbing.
                    This also he made of caribou rawhide, for caribou shrinks when wet, thus
                    tightening the lacing where other materials would stretch. Above and hello the
                    crosspieces he put in a very fine weaving; between them a coarser, that the
                    loose snow might readily sift through. Each strand he tested again and again;
                    each knot he made doubly sure. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0183" n="156"/>
                </p>
                <p>Nor must it be imagined that he did these things alone. May-may-gw&aacute;n
                    helped him, not only by fetching for him the tools and materials, of which he
                    stood in need, but also in the heeding, binding, and webbing itself. Under the
                    soft light of the trees, bathed in the aroma of fresh shavings and the hundred
                    natural odours of the forest, it was exceedingly pleasant accurately to
                    accomplish the light skilled labour. But between these human beings, alone in a
                    vast wilderness, was no communication outside the necessities of the moment.
                    Thus in a little the three pairs of snow-shoes, complete even to the buckskin
                    foot-loops, hung from the sheltered branch of a spruce. </p>
                <p>I "Bring now to me," said the young man, "poles of the hickory, logs of gijik,
                    the cedar; bring me wigwass, the birch-bark, and the rawhide of mooswa, the
                    moose." </p>
                <p>"These things are at hand," repeated May-may-gw&aacute;n. I </p>
                <p>Then ensued days of severe toil. Dick was, of course, unable to handle the axe,
                    so the girl had to do it under his direction. The affair was of wedges with
                    which to split along the grain; of repeated at <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0184"
                        n="157"/> tempts until the resulting strips were true and without warp; of
                    steaming and tying to the proper curve, and, finally, of binding together
                    strongly with the tough <hi rend="italic">babiche</hi> into the shape of the
                    dog-sledge. This, too, was suspended at last beneath the sheltering spruce. </p>
                <p>"Bring me now," said Dick, "rawhide of mooswa, the moose, rawhide of
                    ah-t&eacute;k, the caribou, w&aacute;tab, the root for sewing." </p>
                <p>Seated opposite each other, heads bent over the task, they made the dog-harness,
                    strong, serviceable, not to be worn out, with the collar, the broad buckskin
                    strap over the back, the heavy traces. Four of them they made, for Sam would
                    undoubtedly complete the team, and these, too, they hung out of reach in the
                    spruce-tree. </p>
                <p>Now Sam returned from his longest trip, empty of information, but light of
                    spirit, for he had succeeded by his simple shrewdness in avoiding all suspicion.
                    He brought with him another "husky" dog, and a strong animal like a
                    Newfoundland; also some tea and tobacco, and an axe-blade. This latter would be
                    especially valuable. In the extreme cold steel becomes like glass. The work done
                    earned <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0185" n="158"/> his approval, but he paused
                    only a day, and was off again. </p>
                <p>From the inside of the teepee hung many skins of the northern hare which
                    May-may-gw&aacute;n had captured and tanned while Dick was still on his
                    back. The woven blanket was finished. Now she lined the woollen blankets with
                    these hare-skins, over an hundred to each. Nothing warmer could be imagined. Of
                    caribou skin, tanned with the hair on, she and Dick fashioned jackets with
                    peaked hoods, which, when not in use, would hang down behind. The opening about
                    the face was sewn with bushy fox's tails, and a puckering-string threaded
                    through so that the wearer could completely protect his features. Mittens they
                    made from pelts of the muskrat. Moccasins were cut extra large and high, and
                    lined with fur of the hare. Heavy raw-hide dog-whips and buckskin gun-cases
                    completed the simple winter outfit. </p>
                <p>But still there remained the question of sustenance. Game would be scarce and
                    uncertain in the cold months. </p>
                <p>It was now seven weeks since Dick's accident. Cautiously, with many pauses, he
                    began to rest <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0186" n="159"/> weight on the injured
                    foot. Thanks to the treatment of massage and manipulation, the joint was but
                    little stiffened. Each day it gained in strength. Shortly Dick was able to
                    hobble some little distance, always with the aid of a staff, always heedfully.
                    As yet he was far from the enjoyment of full freedom of movement, but by
                    expenditure of time and perseverance he was able to hunt in a slow, patient
                    manner. The runways where the caribou came to drink late in the evening, a
                    cautious float downstream as far as the first rapids, or even a plain sitting on
                    a log in the hope that game would chance to feed within range-these methods
                    persisted in day after day brought in a fair quantity of meat. </p>
                <p>Of the meat they made some jerky for present consumption by the dogs, and, of
                    course, they ate fresh as much as they needed. But most went into pemmican. The
                    fat was all cut away, the lean sliced thin and dried in the sun. The result they
                    pounded fine, and mixed with melted fat and the marrow, which, in turn, was
                    compressed while warm into air-tight little bags. A quantity of meat went into
                    surprisingly little pemmican. The bags were <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0187"
                        n="160"/> piled on a long-legged scaffolding out of the reach of the dogs
                    and wild animals. </p>
                <p>The new husky and Billy had promptly come to teeth, but Billy had held his own,
                    much to Dick Herron's satisfaction. The larger animal was a bitch, so now all
                    dwelt together in amity. During the still hunt they were kept tied in camp, but
                    the rest of the time they prowled about. Never, however, were they permitted to
                    leave the clearing, for that would frighten the game. At evening they sat in an
                    expectant row, awaiting the orderly distribution of their evening meal. Somehow
                    they added much to the man-feel of the camp. With their coming the atmosphere of
                    men as opposed to the atmosphere of the wilderness had strengthened. On this
                    side was the human habitation, busy at its own affairs, creating about itself a
                    definite something in the forest, unknown before, preparing quietly and
                    efficiently its weapons of offence and defence, all complete in its fires and
                    shelters and industries and domestic animals. On the other, formidable,
                    mysterious, vast, were slowly crystallising, without disturbance, without
                    display, the mighty opposing forces. In the clarified air of the first autumn
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0188" n="161"/> frosts this antagonism seemed
                    fairly to saturate the stately moving days. It was as yet only potential, but
                    the potentialities were swelling, ever swelling toward the break of an actual
                    conflict. </p>

                <p>Now the leaves ripened and fell, and the frost crisped them. Suddenly the forest
                    was still. The great, brooding silence, composed of a thousand lesser woods
                    voices, flowed away like a vapour to he succeeded by a fragile, deathly
                    suspension of sound. Dead leaves depended motionless from the trees. The air
                    hung inert. A soft sunlight lay enervated across the world. </p>
                <p>In the silence had hen a vast, holy mystery of greater purpose and life; in the
                    stillness was a menace. It became the instant of poise before the break of
                    something gigantic. </p>
                <p>And always across it were rising strange rustlings that might mean great things
                    or little, but whose significance was always in doubt. Suddenly the man watching
                    by the runway would hear a mighty scurrying of dead leaves, a scampering, a
                    tumult of hurrying noises, the abruptness of whose inception tightened his
                    nerves and set galloping his <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0190" n="163"/> heart.
                    Then, with equal abruptness, they ceased. The delicate and fragile stillness
                    settled down. </p>
                <p>In all the forest thus diverse affairs seemed to be carried on-fearfully, in
                    sudden, noisy dashes, as a man under fire would dodge from one cover to another.
                    Every creature advertised in the leaves his presence. Danger lurked to this, its
                    advantage. Even the man, taking his necessary footsteps, was abashed at the
                    disproportionate and unusual effects of his movements. It was as though a
                    retiring nature were to be accompanied at every step through a crowded
                    drawing-room by the jingling of hells. Always the instinct was to pause in order
                    that the row might die away, that the man might shrink to his accustomed
                    unobtrusiveness. And instantaneously, without the grace of even a little
                    transitional echo, the stillness fell, crowding so closely on the heels of the
                    man's presence that almost he could feel the breath of whatever it represented. </p>
                <p>Occasionally two red squirrels would descend from the spruce-trees to chase each
                    other madly. Then, indeed, did the spirit of autumn seem to be outraged. The
                    racket came to be an insult. Always the ear expected its discontinuance, until
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0191" n="164"/> finally the persistence ground on
                    the nerves like the barking of a dog at night. At last it was an indecency, an
                    orgy of unholy revel, a profanation, a provocative to anger of the inscrutable
                    woods god. Then stillness again with the abruptness of a sword-cut. </p>
                <p>Always the forest seemed to be the same; and yet somehow in a manner not to be
                    defined a subtle change was taking place in the wilderness. Nothing definite
                    could be instanced. Each morning of that Indian summer the skies were as soft,
                    the sun as grateful, the leaves as gorgeous in their blazonment, yet each
                    morning an infinitesimal something that had hen there the day before was
                    lacking, and for it an infinitesimal something had hen substituted. The change
                    from hour to hour was not perceptible; from week to week it was. The stillness
                    grew in portent; the forest creatures moved more furtively. Like growth, rather
                    than chemical change, the wilderness was turning to iron. With this hardening it
                    became more formidable and menacing. No longer aloof in nirvanic: calm, awakened
                    it drew near its enemies, alert, cunning, circumspect, ready. to strike. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0192" n="165"/>
                </p>
                <p>Each morning a thin film of ice was to be seen along the edges of the slack
                    water. Heavy, black frosts whitened the shadows and nipped the unaccustomed
                    fingers early in the day. The sun was swinging to the south, lengthening the
                    night hours. Whitefish were running in the river. </p>
                <p>These last the man and the girl caught in great numbers, and smoked and piled on
                    long-legged scaffolds. They were intended as winter food for the dogs, and would
                    constitute a great part of what would be taken along when the journey should
                    commence. </p>
                <p>Dick began to walk without his crutches, a very little at a time, grimly, all his
                    old objectless anger returned when the extent of his disability was thus brought
                    home to him. But always with persistence came improvement. Each attempt brought
                    its reward in strengthened muscles, freer joints, greater confidence. At last it
                    could be no longer doubted that by the Indian's Whitefish Moon he would be as
                    good as ever. The discovery, by some queer contrariness of the man's
                    disposition, was avoided as long as possible, and finally but grudgingly
                    admitted. Yet when at last Dick confessed to him <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0193" n="166"/> self that his complete recovery was
                    come, his mood suddenly changed. The old necessity for blind, unreasoning
                    patience seemed at an end. He could perceive light ahead, and so in the absence
                    of any further need for taut spiritual nerves, he relaxed the strain and strode
                    on more easily. He played more with the dogs&mdash;of which still his
                    favourite was Billy; occasionally he burst into little snatches of song, and the
                    sound of his whistling was merry in the air. At length he paused abruptly in his
                    work to fix his quizzical, narrow gaze on the Indian girl. </p>
                <p>"Come, Little Sister," said he, "let us lift the nets." </p>
                <p>She looked up at him, a warm glow leaping to her face. This was the first time he
                    had addressed her by the customary diminutive of friendship since they had both
                    hen members of the Indian camp on the Missin&aacute;ibie. </p>
                <p>They lifted the net together, and half-filled the canoe with the shining fish.
                    Dick bore himself with the careless good humour of his earlier manner. The
                    greater part of the time he seemed unconscious of his companion's presence, but
                    genuinely unconscious, <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0194" n="167"/> not with the
                    deliberate affront of a pretended indifference. Under even this negative good
                    treatment the girl expanded with an almost luxuriant gratitude. Her face lost
                    its stoical mask of imperturbability, and much of her former arch beauty
                    returned. The young man was blind to these things, for he was in reality
                    profoundly indifferent to the girl, and his abrupt change of manner could in no
                    way he ascribed to any change in his feeling for her. It was merely the reflex
                    of his inner mood, and that sprang solely from joy over the permission he had
                    given himself again to contemplate taking the Long Trail. </p>
                <p>But Sam Bolton, returning that very day from his own long journey, saw at once
                    the alteration in May-may-gw&aacute;n, and was troubled over it. He came
                    into camp by the river way where the moss and spruce-needles silenced his
                    footsteps, so he approached unnoticed. The girl bent over the fire. A strong
                    glow from the flames showed the stronger glow illuminating her face from within.
                    She hummed softly a song of the Ojibway language: </p>

                <p>Then she looked up and saw him. </p>
                <p>"Little Father!" she cried, pleased. </p>
                <p>At the same moment Dick caught sight of the new-comer and hobbled out of the
                    wigwam. </p>
                <p>"Hello, you old snoozer!" he shouted. "We began to think you weren't going to
                    show up at all. Look at what we've done. I believe you've hen lying out in the
                    woods just to dodge work. Where'd you steal that dog?" </p>
                <p>"Hello, Dick," replied Sam, unslinging his pack. "I'm tired. Tell her to rustle
                    grub." </p>
                <p>He leaned back against a cedar, half-closing his eyes, but nevertheless keenly
                    alert. The changed atmosphere of the camp disturbed him. Although he had not
                    realised it before, he preferred Dick's old uncompromising sulkiness. </p>
                <p>In accordance with the woods custom, little was said until after the meal was
                    finished and the pipes lit. Then Dick inquired: <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0196"
                        n="169"/>
                </p>
                <p>"Well, where you hen this time, and what did you find?" </p>
                <p>Sam replied briefly as to his journey, making it clear that he had now covered
                    all the hunting districts of this region with the single exception of one beyond
                    the Ken&oacute;gami. He had discovered nothing; he was absolutely sure that
                    nothing was to he discovered. </p>
                <p>"I didn't go entirely by what the Injuns told me," he said, "but I looked at the
                    signs along the trapping routes and the trapping camps to see bow many had hen
                    at it, and I'm sure the number tallies with the regular Injun hunters. I picked
                    up that dog over to Leftfoot Lake. Come here, pup!" </p>
                <p>The animal slouched forward, his head hanging, the rims of his eyes blood red as
                    he turned them up to his master. He was a powerful heist, black and tan, with a
                    quaintly wrinkled, anxious countenance and long, pendent ears. </p>
                <p>"Strong," commented Dick, "but queer-looking. He'll have trouble keeping warm
                    with that short coat." </p>
                <p>"He's wintered here already," replied Sam, indifferently. "Go lie down!" <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0197" n="170"/>
                </p>
                <p>The dog slouched slowly back, his heavy head and ears swinging to each step, to
                    where May-may-gw&aacute;n was keeping his peace with the other animals. </p>
                <p>"Now for that Ken&oacute;gami country," went on Sam; "it's two weeks from
                    here by dogs, and it's our last chance in this country. I ain't dared ask too
                    many questions, of course, so I don't know anything about the men who're hunting
                    there. There's four families, and one other. He's alone; I got that much out of
                    the last place I stopped. We got to wait here for snow. If we don't raise
                    anything there, we'd better get over toward the Nipissing country." </p>
                <p>"All right," said Dick. </p>
                <p>The older man began to ask minutely concerning the equipment, provisions, and dog
                    food. </p>
                <p>"It's all right as long as we can take it easy and bunt," advised Sam, gradually
                    approaching the subject that was really troubling him, "and it's all right if we
                    can surprise this Jingoss or ambush him when we find him. But suppose he catches
                    wind of us and skips, what then? It'll he a mighty pretty race, my son, and a
                    hard one. We'll have to fly <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0198" n="171"/> light and
                    hard, and we'll need every pound of grub we can scrape." </p>
                <p>The young man's eyes darkened and his nostrils expanded with the excitement of
                    this thought. </p>
                <p>"Just let's strike his trail!" he exclaimed. </p>
                <p>"That's all right," agreed the woodsman, his eyes narrowing; "but how about the
                    girl, then?" </p>
                <p>But Dick exhibited no uneasiness. He merely grinned broadly. </p>
                <p>"Well, what about the girl? That's what I've hen telling you. Strikes me that's
                    one of your troubles." </p>
                <p>Half-satisfied, the veteran fell silent. Shortly after he made an opportunity to
                    speak to May-may-gw&aacute;n. </p>
                <p>"All is well, Little Sister?" he inquired. </p>
                <p>"All is well," she replied; "we have finished the parkas, the sledges, the
                    snow-shoes, the blankets, and we have made much food." </p>
                <p>"And Jibiw&aacute;nisi?" </p>
                <p>"His foot is nearly healed. Yesterday he walked to the Big Pool and back. To-day,
                    even this afternoon, Little Father, the Black Spirit left him so that he has hen
                    gay." <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0199" n="172"/>
                </p>
                <p>Convinced that the restored good feeling was the result rather of Dick's volatile
                    nature than of too good an understanding, the old man left the subject. </p>
                <p>"Little Sister,," he went on, "soon we are going to take the winter trail. It may
                    be that we will have to travel rapidly. It may be that food will be scarce. I
                    think it best that you do not go with us." </p>
                <p>She looked up at him. </p>
                <p>"These words I have expected," she replied. "I have heard the speech you have
                    Made with the Ojibway men you have met. I have seen the preparations you have
                    made. I am not deceived. You and Jibiw&aacute;nisi are not looking for
                    winter posts. I do not know what it is you are after, but it is something you
                    wish to conceal. Since you have not told me, I know you wish to conceal it from
                    me. I did not know all this when I left Haukemah and his people. That was a
                    foolish thing. It was done, and I do not know why. But it was done, and it
                    cannot be undone. I could not go back to the people of Haukemah now; they would
                    kill me. Where else can I go? I do not know where the Ojibways, my own people,
                    live." <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0200" n="173"/>
                </p>
                <p>"What do you expect to do, if you stay with me?" inquired Sam, curiously. </p>
                <p>"You come from Conjuror's House. You tell the Indians you come from Winnipeg, but
                    that is not so. When you have finished your affairs, you will return to
                    Conjuror's House. There I can enter the household of some officer." </p>
                <p>"But you cannot take the winter trail," objected Sam. </p>
                <p>"I am strong; I can take the winter trail." </p>
                <p>"And perhaps we may have to journey bard and fast." </p>
                <p>"As when one pursues an enemy," said the girl, calmly. "Good. I am fleet. I too
                    can travel. And if it comes to that, I will leave you without complaint when I
                    can no longer tread your trail." </p>
                <p>"But the food," objected Sam, still further. </p>
                <p>"Consider, Little Father," said May-may-gw&aacute;n; "of the food I have
                    prepared much; of the work, I have done much. I have tended the traps, raised
                    the nets, fashioned many things, attended Eagle-eye. If I had not hen here, then
                    you, Little Father, could not have made your journeys. So you have gained some
                    time." <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0201" n="174"/>
                </p>
                <p>"That is true," conceded Sam. </p>
                <p>"Listen, Little Father, take me with you. I will drive the dogs, make the camp,
                    cook the food. Never will I complain. If the food gets scarce, I will not ask
                    for my share. That I promise." </p>
                <p>"Much of what you say is true," assented the woodsman, "but you forget you came
                    to us of your free will and unwelcomed. It would be better that you go to
                    Missin&aacute;ibie ." </p>
                <p>"No," replied the girl. </p>
                <p>"If you hope to become the squaw of Jibiw&aacute;nisi ," said Sam, bluntly,
                    "you may as well give it up." </p>
                <p>The girl said nothing, but compressed her lips to a straight line. After a moment
                    she merely reiterated her original solution: </p>
                <p>"At Conjuror's House I know the people." </p>
                <p>"I will think of it," then concluded Sam. </p>
                <p>Dick, however, could see no good in such an arrangement. He did not care to
                    discuss the matter at length, but preserved rather the attitude of a man who has
                    shaken himself free of all the responsibility of an affair, and is, mildly
                    amused at the tribulations of another still involved in it. </p>
                <p>"You'll have a lot of trouble dragging a squaw <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0202"
                        n="175"/> all over the north," he advised Sam, critically. "Of course, we
                    can't turn her adrift here. Wouldn't do that to a dog. But it strikes me it
                    would even pay us to go out of our way to Missin&aacute;ibie to get rid of
                    her. We could do that." </p>
                <p>"Well, I don't know-" doubted Sam. "Of course </p>
                <p>"Oh, bring her along if you want to," laughed Dick, "only it's your funeral.
                    You'll 'get into trouble, sure. And don't say I didn't tell you." </p>
                <p>It might have hen imagined by the respective attitudes of the two men that
                    actually Sam had hen responsible for the affair from the beginning. Finally,
                    laboriously, he decided that the girl should go. She could be of assistance;
                    there was small likelihood of the necessity for protracted hasty travel. </p>
                <p>The weather was getting steadily colder. Greasy-looking clouds drove down from
                    the northwest. Heavy winds swept by. The days turned gray. Under the shelter of
                    trees the ground froze into hummocks, which did not thaw out. The crisp leaves
                    which had made the forest so noisy disintegrated into sodden silence. A wildness
                    was in the <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0203" n="176"/> air, swooping down with
                    the breeze, buffeting in the little whirlwinds and eddies, rocking back and
                    forth in the tops of the storm-beaten trees. Cold little waves lapped against
                    the thin fringe of shore ice that crept day by day from the banks. The water
                    itself turned black. Strange birds swirling down wind like leaves uttered weird
                    notes of migration. The wilderness hardened to steel. </p>
                <p>The inmates of the little camp waited. Each morning Dick was early afoot
                    searching the signs of the weather; examining the ice that crept stealthily from
                    shore, waiting to pounce upon and imprison the stream; speculating on the
                    chances of an early season. The frost pinched his bare fingers severely, but he
                    did not mind that. His leg was by now almost as strong as ever, and he was
                    impatient to be away, to leave behind him this rapid that had gained over him
                    even a temporary victory. Always as the time approached, his spirits rose. It
                    would have hen difficult to identify this laughing boy with the sullen and
                    terrible man who had sulked through the summer. He had made friends with all the
                    dogs. Even the fierce "huskies" had become tame, and liked to be upset and
                    tousled about and <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0204" n="177"/> dragged on their
                    backs growling fierce but mock protest. The bitch he had named Claire; the hound
                    with the long ears he had called Mack, hocus of a fancied and mournful likeness
                    to MacDonald, the Chief Trader; the other "husky" he had christened Wolf, for
                    obvious reasons; and there remained, of course, the original Billy. Dick took
                    charge of the feeding. At first he needed his short, heavy whip to preserve
                    order, but shortly his really admirable gift with animals gained way-, and he
                    had them sitting peacefully in a row awaiting each his turn. </p>
                <p>At last the skim ice made it impossible longer to use the canoe in fishing on the
                    river. The craft was, therefore, suspended bottom up between two trees. A little
                    snow fell and remained, but was speedily swept into hollows. The temperature
                    lowered. It became necessary to assume thicker garments. Once having bridged the
                    river the ice strengthened rapidly. And then late one afternoon, on the wings of
                    the northwest wind, came the snow. All night it howled past the trembling
                    wigwam. All the next day it swirled and drifted and took the shapes of fantastic
                    monsters leaping in the <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0205" n="178"/> riot of the
                    storm. Then the stars, cold and brilliant, once more crackled in the heavens.
                    The wilderness in a single twenty-four hours had changed utterly. Winter had
                    come. </p>

                <p>In the starlit, bitter cold of a north country morning the three packed their
                    sledge and harnessed their dogs. The rawhide was stubborn with the frost, the
                    dogs uneasy. Knots would not tie. Pain nipped the fingers, cruel pain that ate
                    in and in until it had exposed to the shock of little contacts every tightened
                    nerve. Each stiff, clumsy movement was agony. From time to time one of the three
                    thrust hand in mitten to heat the freezing back. Then a new red torture surged
                    to the very finger-tips. They bore it in silence, working hastily, knowing that
                    every morning of the long, winter trip this fearful hour must come. Thus each
                    day the North would greet them, squeezing their fingers in the cruel band-clasp
                    of an antagonist testing their strength. </p>
                <p>Over the supplies and blankets was drawn the skin envelope laced to the sledge.
                    The last reluctant knot was tied. Billy, the leader of the four dogs, casting an
                    intelligent eye at his masters, knew <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0207" n="180"/>
                    that all was ready, and so arose from his haunches. Dick twisted his feet
                    skilfully into the loops of his snow-shoes. Sam, already equipped, seized the
                    heavy dog-whip. The girl took charge of the gee-pole with which the sledge would
                    he guided. </p>
                <p>"Mush! Mush on!" shouted Sam. </p>
                <p>The four dogs leaned into their collars. The sledge creaked free of its frost
                    anchorage and moved. </p>
                <p>First it became necessary to drop from the elevation to the river-bed. Dick and
                    May-may-gw&aacute;n clung desperately. Sam exercised his utmost skill and
                    agility to keep the dogs straight. The toboggan hovered an instant over the edge
                    of the bank, then plunged, coasting down. Men bung back, dogs ran to keep ahead.
                    A smother of light snow settled to show, in the dim starlight, the furrow of
                    descent. And on the broad, white surface of the river were eight spot of black
                    which represented the followers of the Long Trail. </p>
                <p>Dick shook himself and stepped ahead of the dogs. </p>
                <p>"Mush! Mush on!" commanded Sam again. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0208" n="181"/>
                </p>
                <p>Dick ran on steadily in the soft snow, swinging his entire weight now on one
                    foot, now on the other, passing the snow-shoes with the peculiar stiff swing of
                    the ankle, throwing his heel strongly downward at each step in order to take
                    advantage of the long snow-shoe tails' elasticity. At each step he sank deep
                    into the feathery snow. The runner was forced to lift the toe of the shoe
                    sharply, and the snow swirled past his ankles like foam. Behind him, in the
                    trail thus broken and packed for them, trotted the dogs, their noses low, their
                    jaws hanging. Sam drove with two long-lashed whips; and May-may-gw&aacute;n,
                    clinging to the gee-pole, guided the sledge. </p>
                <p>In the absolute and dead stillness of a winter morning before the dawn the little
                    train went like ghosts in a mist of starlight. The strange glimmering that seems
                    at such an hour to disengage from the snow itself served merely to establish the
                    separate bulks of that which moved across it. The heeding figure of the man
                    breaking trail, his head low, his body moving in its swing with the regularity
                    of a pendulum; the four wolf-like dogs, also heeding easily to what was not a
                    great labour, the <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0209" n="182"/> line of their open
                    jaws and lolling tongues cut out against the snow; another human figure; the
                    low, dark mass of the sledge; and again the heeding figure at the
                    rear,&mdash;all these contrasted in their half-blurred uncertainty of
                    outline and the suggested motion of their attitude with the straight, clear
                    silhouette of the spruce-trees against the sky. </p>
                <p>Also the sounds of their travelling offered an analogous contrast. The dull <hi
                        rend="italic">crunch, crunch, crunch</hi> of the snow-shoes, the breathing
                    of the living beings, the glither and creak of the sledge came to the ear
                    blurred and confused; utterly unlike the cameo stillness of the winter dawn. </p>
                <p>Ten minutes of the really violent exertion of breaking trail warmed Dick through.
                    His fingers ceased their protest. Each breath, blowing to steam, turned almost
                    immediately to frost. He threw back the hood of his capote, for he knew that
                    should it become wet from the moisture of his breath, it would freeze his skin,
                    and with his violent exertions exposure to the air was nothing. In a short time
                    his eyebrows and eyelashes became heavy with ice. Then slowly the moisture of
                    his body, working outward through the wool of his clothing, frosted on <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0210" n="183"/> the surface, so that gradually as
                    time went on he grew to look more and more like a' great white-furred animal. </p>
                <p>The driving here on the open river was comparatively easy. Except occasionally,
                    the straight line could he adhered to. When it became necessary to avoid an
                    obstruction, Sam gave the command loudly, addressing Billy as the lead dog. </p>
                <p>"Hu, Billy!" he would cry. </p>
                <p>And promptly Billy would turn to the right. Or: </p>
                <p>"Chac, Billy!" he would cry. </p>
                <p>And Billy would turn to the left, with always in mind the thought of the long
                    whip to recall his duty to man. </p>
                <p>Then the other dogs turned after him. Claire, for her steadiness and sense, had
                    hen made sledge-dog. Always she watched sagaciously to pull the end of the
                    sledge strongly away should the deviation not prove sufficient. Later, in the
                    woods, when the trail should become difficult, much would depend on Claire's
                    good sense. </p>
                <p>Now shortly, far to the south, the sun rose. The gray world at once became
                    brilliant. The low frost <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0211" n="184"/>
                    haze,&mdash;invisible until now, to he invisible all the rest of the day,
                    &mdash;for these few moments of the level beams worked strange necromancies.
                    The prisms of a million ice-drops on shrubs and trees took fire. A bewildering
                    flash and gleam of jewels caught the eye in every direction. And, suspended in
                    the air, like the shimmer of a soft and delicate veiling, wavered and floated a
                    mist of vapour, tinted with rose and lilac, with amethyst and saffron. </p>
                <p>As always on the Long Trail, our travellers' spirits rose with the sun. Dick
                    lengthened his stride, the dogs leaned to their collars, Sam threw back his
                    shoulders, the girl swung the sledge tail with added vim. Now everything was
                    warm and bright and beautiful. It was yet too early in the day for fatigue, and
                    the first discomforts had passed. </p>
                <p>But in a few moments Dick stopped. The sledge at once came to a halt. They
                    rested. </p>
                <p>At the end of ten minutes Sam stepped to the front, and Dick took the dog-whip.
                    The young man's muscles, still weak from their long inaction, ached cruelly.
                    Especially was this true of the ligaments at the groin-used in lifting high the
                    knee, -and the long muscles along the front of the shin-bone, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0212" n="185"/> &mdash;by which the toe of the
                    snow-shoe was elevated. He found himself very glad to drop behind into the
                    beaten trail. </p>
                <p>The sun by now had climbed well above the horizon, but did little to mitigate the
                    cold. As long as the violent movement was maintained a warm and grateful glow
                    followed the circulation, but a pause, even of a few moments, brought the
                    shivers. And always the feathery, clogging snow, offering slight resistance, it
                    is true, but opposing that slight resistance continuously, so that at last it
                    amounted to a great deal. A step taken meant no advance toward easier steps. .
                    The treadmill of forest travel, changed only in outward form, again claimed
                    their dogged patience. </p>
                <p>At noon they paused in the shelter of the woods. The dogs were anchored by the
                    simple expedient of turning the sledge on its side. A little fire of dried
                    spruce and pine branches speedily melted snow in the kettle, and that as
                    speedily boiled tea. Caribou steak, thawed, then cooked over the blaze,
                    completed the meal. As soon as it was swallowed they were off again before the
                    cold could mount them. </p>
                <p>The inspiration and uplift of the morning were <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0213"
                        n="186"/> gone; the sun was sinking to a colder and colder setting. All the
                    vital forces of the world were running down. A lethargy seized our travellers.
                    An effort was required merely to contemplate treading the mill during the three
                    remaining hours of daylight, a greater effort to accomplish the first step of
                    it, and an infinite series of ever-increasing efforts to make the successive
                    steps of that long afternoon. The mind became weary. And now the North increased
                    by ever so little the pressure against them, sharpening the cold by a trifle;
                    adding a few flakes' weight to the snow they must lift on their shoes; throwing
                    into the vista before them a deeper, chillier tone of gray discouragement;
                    intensifying the loneliness; giving to the winds of desolation a voice. Well the
                    great antagonist knew she could not thus stop these men, but so, little by
                    little, she ground them down, wore away the excess of their vitality, reduced
                    them to grim plodding, so that at the moment she would hold them weakened to her
                    purposes. They made no sign, for they were of the great men of the earth, but
                    they bent to the familiar touch of many, little fingers pushing them back. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0214" n="187"/>
                </p>
                <p>Now the sun did indeed swing to the horizon, so that there remained scant
                    daylight. </p>
                <p>"Chac, Billy!" cried Sam, who again wielded the whip. </p>
                <p>Slowly, wearily, the little party turned aside. In the grove of spruce the snow
                    clung thick and heavy. A cold blackness enveloped them like a damp blanket.
                    Wind, dying with the sun, shook the snow from the trees and cried mournfully in
                    their tops. Gray settled on the landscape, palpable, real, extinguishing the
                    world. It was the second dreadful hour of the day, the hour when the man, weary,
                    discouraged, the sweat of travel freezing on him, must still address himself to
                    the task of making a home in the wilderness. </p>
                <p>Again the sledge was turned on its side. Dick and May-may-gw&aacute;n removed
                    their snow-shoes, and, using them as shovels, began vigorously to scrape and dig
                    away the snow. Sam unstrained the axe and went for firewood. He cut it with
                    little tentative strokes, for in the intense cold the steel was almost as
                    brittle as glass. </p>
                <p>Now a square of ground flanked by high snow walls was laid bare. The two then
                    stripped boughs <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0215" n="188"/> of balsam with which
                    to carpet all one end of it. They unharnessed the dogs, and laid the sledge
                    across one end of the clear space, covering it with branches in order to keep
                    the dogs from gnawing the moose-skin wrapper. It was already quite dark. </p>
                <p>But at this point Sam returned with fuel. At once the three set about laying a
                    fire nearly across the end of the cleared space opposite the sledge. In a moment
                    a tiny flame cast the first wavering shadows against the darkness. Silently the
                    inimical forces of the long day withdrew. </p>
                <p>Shortly the camp was completed. Heifer the fire, impaled on sticks, bung the
                    frozen whitefish thawing out for the dogs. Each animal was to receive two. The
                    kettle boiled. Meat sizzled over the coals. A piece of ice, whittled to a point,
                    dripped drinking-water like a faucet. The snow-bank ramparts were pink in the
                    glow. They reflected appreciably the heat of the fire, though they were not in
                    the least affected by it, and remained flaky to the touch. A comfortable
                    sizzling and frying and bubbling and snapping filled the little dome of
                    firelight, beyond which was the wilderness. Weary with an immense fatigue the
                    three lay-back waiting for their <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0216" n="189"/>
                    supper to be done. The dogs, too, waited patiently just at the edge of the heat,
                    their bushy tails covering the bottoms of their feet and their noses, as nature
                    intended. Only Mack, the bound, lacking this protection, but hardened to greater
                    exposure, lay flat on his side, his paws extended to the blaze. They all rested
                    quietly, worn out, apparently without the energy to move a single hair. But now
                    Dick, rising, took down from its switch the first of the whitefish. Instantly
                    every dog was on his feet. Their eyes glared yellow, their jaws slavered, they
                    leaped toward the man who held the fish high above his head and kicked
                    energetically at the struggling animals. Sam took the dog whip to help. Between
                    them the food was distributed, two fish to a dog. The beasts took each his share
                    to a place remote from the others and bolted it hastily, returning at once on
                    the chance of a further distribution, or the opportunity to steal from his
                    companions. After a little more roaming about, growling and suspicious sniffing,
                    they again settled down one by one to slumber. </p>
                <p>Almost immediately after supper the three turned in first removing and hanging
                    before the <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0217" n="190"/> fire the duffel and
                    moccasins worn during the day. These were replaced by larger and warmer sleep
                    moccasins lined with fur. The warm-lined coverings they pulled up over and
                    around them completely, to envelop even their heads. This arrangement is
                    comfortable only after long use has accustomed one to the half-suffocation; but
                    it is necessary, not only to preserve the warmth of the body, but also to
                    protect the countenance from freezing. At once they fell into exhausted sleep. </p>
                <p>As though they had awaited a signal, the dogs arose and proceeded to investigate
                    the camp. Nothing was too trivial to escape their attention. Billy found a tiny
                    bit of cooked meat. Promptly he was called on to protect his discovery against a
                    vigorous onslaught from the hound and the other husky. Over and over the
                    fighting dogs rolled, snorting and biting, awakening the echoes of the forest,
                    even trampling the sleepers, who, nevertheless, did not stir. In the mean time,
                    Claire, uninvolved, devoured the morsel. The trouble gradually died down. One
                    after another the animals dug themselves holes in the snow, where they curled
                    up, their bushy tails over their noses and <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0218"
                        n="191"/> their fore paws. Only Mack, the hound with the wrinkled face and
                    long, pendent ears, unendowed with such protection, crept craftily between his
                    sleeping masters. </p>
                <p>Gradually the fire died to coals, then filmed to ashes. Hand in hand the cold and
                    the darkness invaded the camp. As the firelight faded, objects showed dimly,
                    growing ever more distinct through the dying glow-the snow-laden bushes, the
                    pointed trees against a steel sky of stars. The little,, artificial tumult of
                    homely sound by which these men had created for the moment an illusion of life
                    sank down under the unceasing pressure of the verities, so that the wilderness
                    again flowed unobstructed through the forest aisles. With a last pop of coals
                    the faint noise of the fire ceased. Then an even fainter noise slowly became
                    audible, a crackling undertone as of silken banners rustling. And at once,
                    splendid, barbaric, the mighty orgy of the winter-time aurora began. </p>

                <p>In a day or two Dick was attacked by the fearful <foreign lang="fr">
                        <hi rend="italic">mat de raquette,</hi>
                    </foreign> which tortures into knots the muscles of the leg below the knee; and
                    by cramps that doubled him up in his blankets. This was the direct result of his
                    previous inaction. He moved only with pain; and yet, by the stern north-country
                    code, he made no complaint and moved as rapidly as possible. Each time he raised
                    his knee a sharp pain stabbed his groin, as though he had hen stuck by a
                    penknife; each time he bent his ankle in the recover the <foreign lang="fr">
                        <hi rend="italic">mat de raquette</hi>
                    </foreign> twisted his calves, and stretched his ankle tendons until he felt
                    that his very feet were insecurely attached and would drop off. During the
                    evening he sat quiet, but after he had fallen asleep from the mere exhaustion of
                    the day's toil, he doubled up, straightened out, groaned aloud, and spoke
                    rapidly in the strained voice of one who suffers. Often he would strip his legs
                    by the fire, in order that Sam could twist a cleft stick <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0220" n="193"/> vigorously about the affected
                    muscles; which is the Indian treatment. As for the cramps, they took care of
                    themselves. The day's journey was necessarily shortened until he had partly
                    recovered, but even after the worst was over, a long tramp always brought a
                    slight recurrence. </p>
                <p>For the space of nearly ten weeks these people travelled thus in the region of
                    the Kabinik&aacute;gam . Sometimes they made long marches; sometimes they
                    camped for the hunting; sometimes the great, fierce storms of the north drove
                    them to shelter, snowed them under, and passed on shrieking. The wind opposed
                    them. At first of little account, its very insistence gave it value. Always the
                    stinging snow whirling into the face; always the eyes watering and smarting;
                    always the unyielding opposition against which to bend the head; always the rush
                    of sound in the ears,&mdash;a distraction against which the senses had to
                    struggle before they could take their needed cognizance of trail and of game. An
                    uneasiness was abroad with the wind, an uneasiness that infected the men, the
                    dogs, the forest creatures, the very insentient trees themselves. It racked the
                    nerves In it the inimical Spirit of the North <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0221"
                        n="194"/> seemed to find its plainest symbol; though many difficulties she
                    cast in the way were greater to he overcome. </p>
                <p>Ever the days grew shorter. The sun swung above the horizon, low to the south,
                    and dipped back as though pulled by some invisible string. Slanting through the
                    trees it gave little cheer and no warmth. Early in the afternoon it sank,
                    silhouetting the pointed firs, casting across the snow long, crimson shadows,
                    which faded into gray. It was replaced by a moon, chill and remote, dead as the
                    white world on which it looked. </p>
                <p>In the great frost continually the trees were splitting with loud, sudden
                    reports. The cold had long since squeezed the last drops of moisture from the
                    atmosphere. It was metallic, clear, bard as ice, brilliant as the stars,
                    compressed with the freezing. The moon, the stars, the earth, the very heavens
                    glistened like polished steel. Frost lay on the land thick as a coverlid. It hid
                    the east like clouds of smoke. Snow remained unmelted two feet from the
                    camp-fire. </p>
                <p>And the fire alone saved these people from the enemy. If Sam stooped for a moment
                    to adjust his <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0222" n="195"/> snow-shoe strap, he
                    straightened his back with a certain reluctance,&mdash;already the benumbing
                    preliminary to freezing had begun. If Dick, flipping his mitten from his hand to
                    light his pipe, did not catch the fire at the second tug, he had to resume the
                    mitten and heat the circulation into his hand before renewing the attempt, lest
                    the ends of his fingers become frosted. Movement, always and incessantly,
                    movement alone could keep going the vital forces on these few coldest days until
                    the fire had hen built to fight back the white death. </p>
                <p>It was the land of ghosts. Except for the few hours at midday these people moved
                    in the gloom and shadow of a nether world. The long twilight was succeeded by
                    longer night, with its burnished stars, its dead moon, its unearthly aurora. On
                    the fresh snow were the tracks of creatures, but in the flesh they glided Almost
                    invisible. The ptarmigan's head eye alone betrayed him, he had no outline. The
                    ermine's black tip was the only indication of his presence. Even the larger
                    animals,-the caribou, the moose-had either turned a dull gray, or were so rimed
                    by the frost as to have lost all appearance of solidity. It was ever a surprise
                    to find <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0223" n="196"/> these phantoms bleeding red,
                    to discover that their flesh would resist the knife. During the strife of the
                    heavy northwest storms one side of each tree had become more or less plastered
                    with snow, so that even their dark trunks flashed mysteriously into and out of
                    view. In the entire world of the great white silence the only solid, enduring,
                    palpable reality was the tiny sledge train crawling with infinite patience
                    across its vastness. </p>
                <p>White space, a feeling of littleness and impotence, twilight gloom, burnished
                    night, bitter cold, unreality, phantasmagoria, ghosts like those which urged
                    about AElig;neas, and finally clogging, white silence,&mdash;these were the
                    simple but dreadful elements of that journey which lasted, without event, from
                    the middle of November until the latter part of January. </p>
                <p>Never in all that time was an hour of real comfort to he anticipated. The labours
                    of the day were succeeded by the shiverings of the night. Exhaustion alone
                    induced sleep; and the racking chill of early morning alone broke it. The
                    invariable diet was meat, tea, and pemmican. Besides the resolution required for
                    the day's journey and the <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0224" n="197"/> night's
                    discomfort, was the mental anxiety as to whether or not game would he found.
                    Discouragements were many. Sometimes with full anticipation of a good day's run,
                    they would consume hours in painfully dragging the sledge over unexpected
                    obstructions. At such times Wolf, always of an evil disposition, made trouble.
                    Thus besides the resolution of spirit necessary to the work, there had to be
                    pumped up a surplusage to meet the demands of difficult dog-driving. And when,
                    as often happened, a band of the gray wolves would flank them within smelling
                    distance, the exasperation of it became almost unbearable. Time and again Sam
                    had almost forcibly to restrain Dick from using the butt of his whip on Wolf's
                    head. </p>
                <p>Nor could they treat themselves in the weary succession of days to an occasional
                    visit with human beings. During the course of their journey they investigated in
                    turn three of the four trapping districts of the Kabinik&aacute;gam. But
                    Sam's judgment advised that they should not show themselves to the trappers. He
                    argued that no sane man would look for winter posts at this time of year, and it
                    might <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0225" n="198"/> be difficult otherwise to
                    explain the presence of white men. It was quite easy to read by the signs bow
                    many people were to be accounted for in each district, and then it was equally
                    easy to ambush in a tree, during the rounds for examination of the traps, until
                    their identities had all hen established. It was necessary to climb a tree in
                    order to escape discovery by the trapper's dog. Of course the trail of our
                    travellers would be found by the trapper, but unless he actually saw them he
                    would most probably conclude them to be Indians moving to the west. Accordingly
                    Dick made long detours to, intercept the trappers, and spent many cold hours
                    waiting for them to pass, while Sam and the girl hunted in another direction to
                    replenish the supplies. In this manner the frequenters of these districts had
                    hen struck from the list. No one of them was Jingoss. There remained but one
                    section, and that the most northerly. If that failed, then there was nothing to
                    do but to retrace the long, weary journey up the Kabinik&aacute;gam , past
                    the rapids where Dick had hurt himself, over the portage, down the
                    Mattawishgina, across the Missina&iacute;bie , on which they had started
                    their travels, to the country of the <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0226" n="199"/>
                    Nipissing. Discussing this possibility one rest time, Dick said: </p>
                <p>"We'd be right back where we started. I think it would pay us to go down to
                    Brunswick House and get a new outfit. It's only about a week up the
                    Missin&aacute;ibie ." Then, led by inevitable association of ideas, "Wonder
                    if those Crees had a good, time? And I wonder if they've knocked our friend
                    Ah-tek, the Chippewa, on the head yet? He was a bad customer." </p>
                <p>"You better hope they have," replied Sam. "He's got it in for you." </p>
                <p>Dick shrugged his shoulders and laughed easily. </p>
                <p>"That's all right," insisted the older man; "just the same, an Injun never
                    forgets and never fails to get even. You may think he's forgotten, but he's
                    layin' for you just the same," and then, hocus they happened to be resting in
                    the lea of a bank and the sun was at its highest for the day, Sam went on to
                    detail one example after another from his wide observation of the tenacity with
                    which an Indian pursues an obligation, whether of gratitude or enmity. "They'll
                    travel a thousand miles to get even," he concluded. "They'll drop the most
                    important <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0227" n="200"/> business they got, if they
                    think they have a good chance to make a killing. He'll run up against you some
                    day, my son, and then you'll have it out." </p>
                <p>"All right," agreed Dick, "I'll take care of him. Perhaps I'd better get
                    organised; he may he laying for me around the next bend." </p>
                <p>"I don't know what made us talk about it," said Sam, "but funnier things have
                    happened to me." </p>
                <p>Dick, with mock solicitude, loosened his knife. </p>
                <p>But Sam had suddenly become grave. "I believe in those things," he said, a little
                    fearfully. "They save a man sometimes, and sometimes they help him to get what
                    he wants. It's a Chippewa we're after; it's a Chippewa we've hen talkin' about.
                    They's something in it." </p>
                <p>"I don't know what you're driving at," said Dick. </p>
                <p>"I don't know," confessed Sam, "but I have a kind of a bunch we won't have to go
                    back to the Nipissing." He looked gropingly about, without seeing, in the manner
                    of an old man. </p>
                <p>"I hope your hunch is a good one,," replied Dick. "Well, mush on!" <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0228" n="201"/>
                </p>
                <p>The little cavalcade had made barely a dozen steps in advance when Sam, who was
                    leading, came to a dead halt. </p>
                <p>"Well, what do you make of that?" he asked. </p>
                <p>Across the way lay the trunk of a fallen tree. It had hen entirely covered with
                    snow, whose line ran clear and unbroken its entire length except at one point,
                    where it dipped to a shallow notch. </p>
                <p>"Well, what do you make of that?" Sam inquired again. </p>
                <p>"What?" asked Dick. </p>
                <p>Sam pointed to the shallow depression in the snow covering the prostrate
                    tree-trunk.</p>

                <p>Dick looked at his companion a little bewildered. </p>
                <p>"Why, you must know as well as I do," he said, "somebody stepped on top of that
                    log with snowshoes, and it's snowed since." </p>
                <p>"Yes, but who?" insisted Sam. </p>
                <p>"The trapper in this district, of course." </p>
                <p>"Sure; and let me tell you this,&mdash;that trapper is the man we're after.
                    That's his trail."' </p>
                <p>"How do you know?" </p>
                <p>"I'm sure. I've got a hunch." </p>
                <p>Dick looked sceptical, then impressed. After all, you never could tell what a man
                    might not learn out in the Silent Places, and the old woodsman had grown gray
                    among woods secrets. </p>
                <p>"We'll follow the trail and find his camp," pursued Sam. </p>
                <p>"You ain't going to ambush him?" inquired Dick. </p>
                <p>"What's the use? He's the last man we have to <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0230"
                        n="203"/> tend to in this district, anyway. Even if it shouldn't be Jingoss,
                    we don't care if he sees us. We'll tell him we're travelling from York to
                    Winnipeg. It must be pretty near on the direct line from here." </p>
                <p>"All right," said Dick. </p>
                <p>They set themselves to following the trail. As the only persistences of it
                    through the last storm were to be found where the snow-shoes had left deep
                    notches on the fallen timber, this was not an easy matter. After a time the
                    affair was simplified by the dogs. Dick had hen breaking trail, but paused a
                    moment to tie his shoe. The team floundered ahead. After a moment it discovered
                    the half-packed snow of the old trail a foot below the newer surface, and,
                    finding it easier travel, held to it. Between the partial success at this, and
                    an occasional indication on the tops of fallen trees, the woodsmen managed to
                    keep the direction of the fore-runner's travel. </p>
                <p>Suddenly Dick stopped short in his tracks. </p>
                <p>"Look there!" he exclaimed. </p>
                <p>Heifer them was a place where a man had camped for the night. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0231" n="204"/>
                </p>
                <p>"He's travelling!" cried Sam. </p>
                <p>This exploded the theory that the trail had hen made by the Indian to whom the
                    trapping rights of the district belonged. At once the two men began to spy here
                    and there eagerly, trying to reconstruct from the meagre vestiges of occupation
                    who the camper had hen and what he had hen doing. </p>
                <p>The condition of the fire corroborated what the condition of the trail had
                    indicated. Probably the man had passed about three days ago. The nature of the
                    fire proclaimed him an Indian, for it was small and round, where a white man's
                    is long and hot. He had no dogs; therefore his journey was short, for,
                    necessarily, he was carrying what he needed on his back. Neither on the route
                    nor here in camp were any indications that he had carried or was examining
                    traps; so the conclusion was that this trip was not merely one of the long
                    circles a trapper sometimes makes about the limits of his domain. What, then,
                    was the errand of a single man, travelling light and fast in the dead of winter? </p>
                <p>"It's the man we're after," said Sam, with conviction. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0232" n="205"/> "He's either taken the alarm, or he's
                    visiting. </p>
                <p>"Look," called the girl from beneath the wide branches of a spruce. </p>
                <p>They went. Beneath a lower limb, whose fan had protected it from the falling
                    snow, was the single clear print of a snow-shoe. </p>
                <p>"Hah!" cried Sam, in delight, and fell on his knees to examine it. At the first
                    glance he uttered another exclamation of pleasure, for, though the shoe had hen
                    of the Ojibway pattern, in certain modifications it suggested a more northerly
                    origin. The toes had hen craftily upturned, the tails shortened, the webbing
                    more closely woven. </p>
                <p>"It's Ojibway induced Sam, over his shoulder, "but the man who made it has lived
                    among the Crees. That fits Jingoss. Dick, it's the man we're after! </p>
                <p>It was by now almost noon. They boiled tea at the old camp site, and tightened
                    their belts for a stern chase. </p>
                <p>That afternoon the head wind opposed them, exasperating, tireless in its
                    resistance, never lulling for a single instant. At the moment it seemed more <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0233" n="206"/> than could be borne. Near one o'clock
                    it did them a great despite, for at that hour the trail came to a broad and wide
                    lake. There the snow had fallen, and the wind had drifted it so that the surface
                    of the ice was white and smooth as paper. The faint trail led accurately to the
                    bank-and was obliterated. </p>
                <p>Nothing remained but to circle the shores to right and to left until the place of
                    egress was discovered. This meant long work and careful work, for the lake was
                    of considerable size. It meant that the afternoon would go, and perhaps the day
                    following, while the man whose footsteps they were following would be drawing
                    steadily away. </p>
                <p>It was agreed that May-may-gw&aacute;n should remain with the sledge, that
                    Dick should circle to the right, and Sam to the left, and that all three should
                    watch each other carefully for a signal of discovery. </p>
                <p>But now Sam happened to glance at Mack, the wrinkle-nosed bound. The sledge had
                    hen pulled a short distance out on the ice. Mack, alternately whining and
                    sniffing, was trying to induce his comrades to turn slanting to the left. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0234" n="207"/>
                </p>
                <p>"What's the matter with that dog?" he inquired on a sudden. </p>
                <p>"Smells something; what's the difference? Let's get a move on us," replied Dick,
                    carelessly. </p>
                <p>"Hold on," ordered Sam. </p>
                <p>He rapidly changed the dog-harness in order to put Mack in the lead. </p>
                <p>"Mush! Mush on!" he commanded. </p>
                <p>Immediately the hound, his nose low, uttered a deep, hell-like note and struck on
                    the diagonal across the lake. </p>
                <p>"Come on," said Sam; "he's got it." </p>
                <p>Across the white waste of the lake, against the bite of the unobstructed wind,
                    under the shelter of the bank opposite they ran at slightly accelerated speed,
                    then without pause into the forest on the other side. </p>
                <p>"Look," said the older woodsman, pointing ahead to a fallen trunk. It was the
                    trail. </p>
                <p>"That was handy," commented Dick, and promptly forgot about it. But Sam treasured
                    the incident for the future. </p>
                <p>And then, just before two o'clock, the wind did them a great service. Down the
                    long, straight lines <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0235" n="208"/> of its flight
                    came distinctly the creak of snow-shoes. Evidently the traveller, whoever he
                    might be, was retracing his steps. </p>
                <p>At once Sam overturned the sledge, thus anchoring the dogs, and Dick ran ahead to
                    conceal himself. May-may-gw&aacute;n offered a suggestion. </p>
                <p>"The dogs may bark too soon," said she. </p>
                <p>Instantly Sam was at work binding fast their jaws with buckskin thongs. The girl
                    assisted him. When the task was finished he ran forward to join Dick, hidden in
                    the bushes. </p>
                <p>Eight months of toil focussed in the moment. The faint creaking of the shoes came
                    ever louder down the wind. Once it paused. Dick caught his breath. Had the
                    traveller discovered anything suspicious? He glanced behind him. </p>
                <p>"Where's the girl?" he hissed between his teeth. "Damn her, she's warned him!" </p>
                <p>But almost with Sam's reply the creaking began again, and after an instant of
                    indetermination continued its course. </p>
                <p>Then suddenly the woodsmen, with a simultaneous movement, raised their rifles,
                    and with equal <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0236" n="209"/> unanimity lowered
                    them, gasping with astonishment. Dick's enemy, Ah-tek, the renegade Chippewa of
                    Haukemah's band on the Missin&aacute;ibie , stepped from the concealment of
                    the bushes.</p>

                <p>Of the three the Indian was the first to recover. </p>
                <p>"Bo' jou', bo' jou'," said he, calmly. </p>
                <p>Sam collected himself to a reply. Dick said nothing, but fell behind, with his
                    rifle across his arm. All marched on in silence to where lay the dog-sledge,
                    guarded by May-may-gw&aacute;n. The Chippewa's keen eyes took in every
                    detail of the scene, the overturning of the sledge, the muzzling of the dogs,
                    the general nature of the equipment. If he made any deductions, he gave no sign,
                    nor did he evince any further astonishment at finding these men so far north at
                    such a time of year. Only, when he thought himself unobserved, he cast a glance
                    of peculiar intelligence at the girl, who, after a moment's hesitation, returned
                    it. </p>
                <p>The occasion was one of elaborate courtesy. Sam ordered tea boiled, and offered
                    his tobacco. Over the fire he ventured a more direct inquiry than his customary
                    policy would have advised. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0238" n="211"/>
                </p>
                <p>"My brother is a long journey from the Missin&aacute;ibie." </p>
                <p>The Chippewa assented. </p>
                <p>"Haukemah, then, hunts these districts." </p>
                <p>The Chippewa replied no. </p>
                <p>"My brother has left Haukemah." </p>
                <p>Again the Chippewa denied, but after enjoying for a moment the baffling of the
                    old man's intentions, he volunteered information. </p>
                <p>"The trapper of this district is my brother. I have visited him." </p>
                <p>"It was a short visit for so long a journey. The trail is but three days old." </p>
                <p>Ah-tek assented gravely. Evidently he cared very little whether or not his
                    explanation was accepted. </p>
                <p>"How many days to Winnipeg?" asked Sam. </p>
                <p>"I have never hen there," replied the Indian. </p>
                <p>"We have summered in the region of the Missin&aacute;ibie," proffered Sam.
                    "Now we go to Winnipeg!, </p>
                <p>The Indian's inscrutable countenance gave no indication as to whether or not he
                    believed this. After a moment he knocked the ashes from his pipe <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0239" n="212"/> and arose, casting another sharp
                    glance ' at May may-gw&aacute;n. She had hen busy at the sledge. Now she
                    approached, carrying simply her own blankets and clothing. </p>
                <p>"This man," said she to the two, "is of my people. He returns to them. I go with
                    him." </p>
                <p>The Chippewa twisted his feet into his snowshoes, nodded to the white men, and
                    swung away on the back trail in the direction whence our travellers had come.
                    The girl, without more leave-taking, followed close at his back. For an instant
                    the crunch of shoes splintered the frosty air. Then they rounded a bend. Silence
                    fell swift as a hawk. </p>
                <p>"Well, I'll be damned!" ejaculated Dick at last. "Do you think he was really up
                    here visiting?" </p>
                <p>"No, of course not," replied Sam. "Don't you see&mdash;" </p>
                <p> "Then he came after the girl?" </p>
                <p>"Good God, no!" answered Sam. "He&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Then he was after me," interrupted Dick again with growing excitement. "Why
                    didn't you let me shoot him, Sam&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Will you shut up and listen to me?" demanded the old man, impatiently. "If he'd
                    wanted -you, <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0240" n="213"/> he'd have got you when
                    you were hurt last summer; and if he'd wanted the girl, he'd have got her then,
                    too. It's all clear to me. He has hen visiting a friend,&mdash;perhaps his
                    brother, as he said,-and he did spend less than three days in the visit. What
                    did he come for? Let me tell you! That friend, or brother, is Jingoss, and he
                    came up here to warn him that we're after him. The Chippewa suspected us a
                    little on the Missin&aacute;ibie, but he wasn't sure. Probably he's had his
                    eye on us ever since." </p>
                <p>"But why didn't he warn this Jingoss long ago, then?" objected Dick. </p>
                <p>"Hocus we fooled him, just as we fooled all the Injuns. We might be looking for
                    winter posts, just as we said. And then if he came up here and told Jingoss we
                    were after him, when really we didn't know beans about Jingoss and his steals,
                    and then this Jingoss should skip the country and leave an almighty good fur
                    district all for nothing, that would be a nice healthy favour to do for a man,
                    wouldn't it! No, he had to be sure before he made any moves. And he didn't get
                    to be sure until he heard somehow from some one who saw our trails that three
                    people were travelling in the winter up <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0241" n="214"
                    /> through this country. Then he piked out to warn Jingoss." </p>
                <p>"I believe you're right!" cried Dick. </p>
                <p>"Of course I'm right. And another thing; if that's the case we're pretty close
                    there. How many more trappers are there in this district? Just one! And since
                    this Chippewa is going back on his back trail within three days after he made
                    it, he couldn't have gone farther than that one man. And that one man must be-" </p>
                <p>"Jingoss himself!" finished Dick. </p>
                <p>"Within a day and a half of us, anyway; probably much closer," supplemented Sam.
                    "It's as plain as a sledge-trail." </p>
                <p>"He's hen warned," Dick reminded him. </p>
                <p>But Sam, afire with the inspiration of inductive reasoning, could see no
                    objection there. </p>
                <p>"This Chippewa knew we were in the country," he argued, "but he hadn't any idea
                    we were so close. If he had, he wouldn't have hen so foolish as to follow his
                    own back track when he was going out. I don't know what his ideas were, of
                    course, but he was almighty surprised to see us here. He's warned this Jingoss,
                    not more than a day or so ago. But <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0242" n="215"/> he
                    didn't tell him to skedaddle at once. He said, 'Those fellows are after you, and
                    they're moseying around down south of here, and probably they'll get up here in
                    the course of the winter. You'd probably better slide out 'till they get done.'
                    Then he stayed a day and smoked a lot, and started back. Now, if Jingoss just
                    thinks we're coming <hi rend="italic">some time,</hi> and not to-morrow, he
                    ain't going to pull up stakes in such a hell of a hurry. He'll pack what furs
                    he's got, and he'll pick up what traps he's got out. That would take him several
                    days, anyway. My son, we're in the nick of time!" </p>
                <p>"Sam, you're a wonder," said Dick, admiringly. "I never could have thought all
                    that out." </p>
                <p>"If that idea's correct," went on Sam, "and the Chippewa's just come from
                    Jingoss, why we've got the Chippewa's trail to follow back, haven't we?" </p>
                <p>"Sure!" agreed Dick, "all packed and broken." </p>
                <p>They righted the sledge and unbound the dogs' jaws. </p>
                <p>"Well, we got rid of the girl," said Dick, casually. "Damn little fool. I didn't
                    think she'd leave us that easy. She'd hen with us quite a while." </p>
                <p>"Neither did I," admitted Sam; "but it's natural, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0243" n="216"/> Dick. We ain't her people, and we
                    haven't treated her very well, and I don't wonder she was sick of it and took
                    the first chance back. We've got our work cut out for us now, and we're just as
                    well off without her." . </p>
                <p>"The Chippewa's a sort of public benefactor all round," said Dick. </p>
                <p>The dogs yawned prodigiously, stretching their jaws after the severe muzzling.
                    Sam began reflectively to undo the flaps of the sledge. </p>
                <p>"Guess we'd better camp here," said he. "It's getting pretty late and we're due
                    for one hell of a tramp to-morrow."</p>

                <p>Some time during the night May-may-gw&aacute;n rejoined them. Sam was
                    awakened by the demonstration of the dogs, at first hostile, then friendly with
                    recognition. He leaped to his feet, startled at the apparition of a human
                    figure. Dick sat up alert at once. The fire had almost died, but between the
                    glow of its embers and the light of the aurora sifted through the trees they
                    made her out. </p>
                <p>"Oh, for God's <hi rend="italic">sake!"</hi> snarled Dick, and lay back again in
                    his blankets, but in a moment resumed his sitting position. "She made her
                    choice," he proffered vehemently, "make her stick to it! Make her stick to it.
                    She can't change her mind every other second like this, and we don't <hi
                        rend="italic">need</hi> her!" </p>
                <p>But Sam, piling dry wood on the fire, looked in her face. </p>
                <p>"Shut up, Dick," he commanded sharply. "Something in this." <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0245" n="219"/>
                </p>
                <p>The young man stared at his companion an enigmatical instant, hesitating as to
                    his reply. </p>
                <p>"Oh,, all right," he replied at last with ostentatious indifference. "I don't
                    give a damn. Don't sit up too late with the young lady. Good night!" He
                    disappeared beneath his coverings, plainly disgruntled, as, for a greater or
                    less period of time, he always was when even the least of his plans or points of
                    view required readjustment. </p>
                <p>Sam boiled tea, roasted a caribou steak, knelt and removed the girl's damp
                    foot-gear and replaced it with fresh. Then he held the cup to her lips, cut the
                    tough meat for her with his hunting-knife, even fed her as though she were a
                    child. He piled more wood on the fire, he wrapped about her shoulders one of the
                    blankets with the hare-skin lining. Finally, when nothing more remained to be
                    done, he lit his pipe and squatted on his heels close to her, lending her mood
                    the sympathy of human silence. </p>
                <p>She drank the tea, swallowed the food, permitted the change of her foot-gear,
                    bent her shoulders to the blanket, all without the appearance of consciousness.
                    The corners of her lips were bent firmly <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0246"
                        n="219"/> downward. Her eyes, fixed and exalted, gazed beyond the fire,
                    beyond the dancing shadows, beyond the world. After a long interval she began to
                    speak, low-voiced, in short disconnected sentences. </p>
                <p>"My brothers seek the Ojibway, Jingoss. They will take him to Conjuror's House.

                    hours to the north. I know where it is. Jingoss has three dogs. He has much
                    meat. He has no gun but the trade-gun. I have learned this. I come to tell it to
                    my brothers." </p>
                <p>"Why, May-may-gw&aacute;n?" inquired Sam, gently. </p>
                <p>She turned on him a look of pride. </p>
                <p>"Have you thought I had left you for him?" she asked. "I have learned these
                    things." </p>
                <p>Sam uttered an exclamation of dismay. </p>
                <p>"What?" she queried with a slow surprise. </p>
                <p>"But he, the Chippewa," Sam pointed out, "now he knows of our presence. He will
                    aid Jingoss; he will warn him afresh to-night!" </p>
                <p>May-may-gw&aacute;n was again rapt in sad but exalted <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0247" n="220"/> contemplation of something beyond.
                    She answered merely by a contemptuous gesture. </p>
                <p>"But&mdash;" insisted Sam. </p>
                <p>"I know," she replied, with conviction. </p>
                <p>Sam, troubled he knew not why, leaned forward to arrange the fire. </p>
                <p>"How do you know, Little Sister?" he inquired, after some hesitation. </p>
                <p>She answered by another weary gesture. Again Sam hesitated. </p>
                <p>"Little Sister," said he, at last, "I am an old man. I have seen many years pass.
                    They have left me some wisdom. They have made my heart good to those who are in
                    trouble. If it was not to return to your own people, then why did you go with
                    Ah-tek this morning?" </p>
                <p>"That I might know what my brothers wished to know." </p>
                <p>"And you think he told you all these things truly?" doubted Sam. </p>
                <p>She looked directly at him. </p>
                <p>"Little Father," said she slowly, "long has this man wanted me to live in his
                    wigwam. For that he joined ~ Haukemah's band;&mdash;because I was there. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0248" n="221"/> I have hen good in his eyes. Never
                    have I given him favour. My favour always would unlock his heart." </p>
                <p>"But are you sure he spoke truth," objected Sam. "You have never looked kindly on
                    him. You left Haukemah's band to go with us. How could he trust you?" </p>
                <p>She looked at him bravely. </p>
                <p>"Little Father," she replied, "there is a moment when man and woman trust
                    utterly, and when they say truly what lies in their hearts." </p>
                <p>"Good God!" cried Sam, in English. </p>
                <p>"It was the only way," she answered the spirit of his interjection. "I had known
                    before only his forked tongue." </p>
                <p>"Why did you do this, girl? You had no right, no reason. You should have
                    consulted us." </p>
                <p>"Little Father," said she, "the people of your race are a strange people. I do
                    not understand them. An evil is done them, and they pass it by; a good is done
                    them, and they do not remember. With us it is different. Always in our hearts
                    dwell the good and the evil." </p>
                <p>"What good have we done to you?" asked Sam. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0249"
                        n="222"/>
                </p>
                <p>"Jibiw&aacute;nisi has looked into my heart," she replied, lapsing into the
                    Indian rhetoric of deep emotion. "He has looked into my heart, and in the
                    doorway he blots out the world. At the first I wanted to die when he would not
                    look on me with favour. Then I wanted to die when I thought I should never
                    possess him. Now it is enough that I am near him, that I lay his fire, and cook
                    his tea and caribou, that I follow his trail, that I am ready when he needs me,
                    that I can raise my eyes and see him breaking the trail. For when I look up at
                    him the sun breaks out, and the snow shines, and there is a light under the
                    trees. And 'when I think of -raising my eyes, and be not there, nor anywhere
                    near, then my heart freezes, Little Father, freezes with loneliness." </p>
                <p>Abruptly she arose, casting aside the blanket and stretching her anus rigid above
                    her head. Then with equal abruptness she stooped, caught up her bedding, spread
                    it out, and lay down stolidly to rest, turning her back to both the white men. </p>
                <p>But Sam remained crouched by the fire until the morning hour of waking, staring
                    with troubled eyes.</p>

                <p>Later in the morning Dick attempted some remark on the subject of the girl's
                    presence. At once Sam whirled on him with a gust of passion utterly unlike his
                    ordinary deliberate and even habit. </p>
                <p> "Shut your damned mouth!" he fairly shouted. </p>
                <p>Dick whistled in what he thought was a new enlightenment, and followed literally
                    the other's vigorous advice. Not a syllable did he utter for an hour, by which
                    time the sun had risen. Then he stopped and pointed to a fresh trail converging
                    into that they were following. </p>
                <p>The prints of two pairs of snow-shoes joined; those of one returned. </p>
                <p>Sam gasped. Dick looked ironical. The interpretation was plain without the need
                    of words. The Chippewa and the girl, although they had started to the southeast,
                    had made a long detour in order again to reach Jingoss. These two pairs of
                    snowshoe tracks marked where they had considered it <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0251" n="224"/> safe again to strike into the old
                    trail made by the Chippewa in going and coming. The one track showed where
                    Ah-tek had pushed on to rejoin his friend; the other was that of the girl
                    returning for some reason the night before, perhaps to throw them off the scent. </p>
                <p>"Looks as if they'd fooled you, and fooled you good," said Dick, cheerfully. </p>
                <p>For a single instant doubt drowned Sam's faith in his own insight and in human
                    nature. </p>
                <p>"Dick," said he, quietly, "raise your eyes." </p>
                <p>Not five rods farther on the trail the two had camped for the night. Evidently
                    Ah-tek had discovered his detour to have lasted out the day, and, having
                    satisfied himself that his and his friend's enemies were not ahead of him, he
                    had called a halt. The snow had hen scraped away, the little fire built, the
                    ground strewn with boughs. So far the indications were plain and to be read at a
                    glance. But upright in the snow were two snow-shoes, and tumbled on the ground
                    was bedding. </p>
                <p>Instantly the two men leaped forward. May-may-gw&aacute;n, her face stolid
                    and expressionless, but her eyes glowing, stood straight and motionless by <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0252" n="225"/> the dogs. Together they laid hold of
                    the smoothly spread top blanket and swept it aside. Beneath was a jumble of
                    warmer bedding. In it, his fists clenched, his eyes half open in the horrific
                    surprise of a sudden calling, lay the Chippewa stabbed to the heart. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0253" n="226"/>

                <head>Chapter 23</head>

                <p>The silence of the grave lay over the white world. Deep in the forest a tree
                    detonated with the frost. There by the cold last night's camp the four human
                    figures posed, motionless as a wind that has died. Only the dogs, lolling,
                    stretching, sending the warm steam of their breathing into the dead air, seemed
                    to stand for the world of life, and the world of sentient creatures. And yet
                    their very presence, unobtrusive in the forest shadows, by contrast thrust
                    farther these others into the land of phantoms and of ghosts. </p>
                <p>Then quietly, as with one consent, the three living ones turned away. The older
                    woodsman stepped into the trail, leading the way for the dogs; the younger
                    woodsman swung in behind at the gee-pole; the girl followed. Once more, slowly,
                    as though reluctant, the forest trees resumed their silent progress past those
                    three toiling in the treadmill of the days. The camp dropped back; it con <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0254" n="227"/> fused itself in the frost mists; it
                    was gone, gone into the mystery and the vastness of the North, gone with its
                    tragedy and its symbol of the greatness of human passion, gone with its one
                    silent watcher staring at the sky, awaiting the coming of day. The frost had
                    mercifully closed again about its revelation. No human eye would ever read that
                    page again. </p>
                <p>Each of the three seemed wrapped in the splendid isolation of his own dream. They
                    strode on sightless, like somnambulists. Only mechanically they kept the trail,
                    and why they did so they could not have told. No coherent thoughts passed
                    through their brains. But always the trees, frost-rimed, drifted past like
                    phantoms; always the occult influences of the North loomed large on their
                    horizon like mirages, dwindled in the actuality, but threatened again in the
                    bigness of mystery when they had passed. The North was near, threatening,
                    driving the terror of her tragedy home to the hearts of these staring mechanical
                    plodders, who now travelled they knew not why, farther and farther into the
                    depths of dread. . </p>
                <p>But the dogs stopped, and Billy, the leader, <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0255"
                        n="228"/> sniffed audibly in inquiry of what lay ahead. Instantly, in the
                    necessity for action, the spell broke. The mystery which had lain so long at
                    their horizon, which but now had crept in, threatening to smother them, rolled
                    back to its accustomed place. The north withheld her hand. </p>
                <p>Heifer them was another camp, one that had hen long used. A conical tepee or
                    wigwam, a wide space cleared of snow, much debris, racks and scaffolds for the
                    accommodation of supplies, all these attested long occupancy. </p>
                <p>Sam jerked the cover from his rifle, and cast a hasty glance at the nipple to see
                    if it was capped. Dick jumped forward and snatched aside the 'opening into the
                    wigwam. </p>
                <p>"Not at home!" said he. </p>
                <p>"Gone," corrected Sam, pointing to a fresh trail beyond. </p>
                <p>At once the two men turned their attention to this. After some difficulty they
                    established the fact of a three-dog team. Testing the consistency of the snow
                    they proved a heavy load on the toboggan. </p>
                <p>"I'm afraid that means he's gone for good," said Sam. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0256"/>
                <p>Dick jumped forward and snatched aside the opening into the wigwam</p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0257"/>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0258" n="229"/>

                <p>A further examination of camp corroborated this. The teepee had hen made double,
                    with the space between the two walls stuffed with moss, so evidently it had hen
                    built as permanent winter quarters. The fact of its desertion at this time of
                    year confirmed the reasoning as to the identity of its occupant and the fact of
                    his having hen warned by the dead Chippewa. Skulls of animals indicated a fairly
                    prosperous fur season. But the skulls of animals, a broken knife, a pile of
                    balsam-boughs, and the deserted wigwam were all that remained. Jingoss had taken
                    with him his traps, his pelts, his supplies. </p>
                <p>"That's a good thing," concluded Sam, "a mighty good thing. It shows he ain't
                    much scared. He don't suspect we're anywhere's near him; only that it ain't very
                    healthy to spend the winter in this part of the country. If he'd thought we was
                    close, he wouldn't have lugged along a lot of plunder; he'd be flying mighty
                    light." </p>
                <p>"That's right," agreed Dick. </p>
                <p>"And in that case he isn't travelling very fast. We'll soon catch up." </p>
                <p>"He only left this morning," supplemented <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0259"
                        n="230"/> Dick, examining the frost-crystals in the new-cut trail. </p>
                <p>Without wasting further attention, they set out in pursuit. The girl followed.
                    Dick turned to her. </p>
                <p>"I think we shall catch him very soon," said he., in Ojibway. </p>
                <p>The girl's face brightened and her eyes filled. The simple words admitted her. to
                    confidence, implied that she, too, had her share in the undertaking, her
                    interest in its outcome. She stepped for ward with winged feet of gladness. </p>
                <p>Luckily a light wind had sprung up against them. They proceeded as quietly and as
                    swiftly as they could. In a short time they came to a spot where Jingoss had
                    boiled tea. This indicated that he must have started late in the morning to have
                    accomplished only so short a distance before noon. The trail, too, became
                    fresher. I Billy, the regular lead dog, on this occasion occupied his official
                    position ahead, although, as has hen pointed out, he was sometimes alternated
                    with the hound, who now ran just behind him. Third trotted Wolf, a strong heist,
                    but a stupid; then Claire, at the sledge, sagacious, alert, ready to turn <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0260" n="231"/> the sledge from obstruction. For a
                    long time all these beasts, with the strange intelligence of animals much
                    associated with man, had entertained a strong interest in the doings of their
                    masters. Something besides the day's journey was in the wind. They felt it
                    through their keen instinctive responsiveness to the moods of those over them;
                    they knew it by the testimony of their bright eyes which told them that these
                    investigations and pryings were not all in an ordinary day's travel.
                    Investigations and pryings appeal to a dog's nature. Especially did Mack, the
                    hound, long to be free of his harness that he, too, might sniff here and there
                    in odd nooks and crannies, testing with that marvellously keen nose of his what
                    his masters regarded so curiously. Now at last he understood from the frequent
                    stops and examinations that the trail was the important thing. From time to time
                    he sniffed of it deeply, saturating his memory with the quality of its effluvia.
                    Always it grew fresher. And then at last the warm animal scent rose alive to his
                    nostrils, and he lifted his head and bayed. </p>
                <p>The long, weird sound struck against the silence with the impact of a blow.
                    Nothing more undesirable <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0261" n="232"/> could have
                    happened. Again Mack bayed, and the echoing hell tones of his voice took on a
                    strange similarity to a tocsin of warning. Rustling and crackling across the
                    men's fancies the influences of the North moved invisible, alert, suddenly
                    roused. </p>
                <p>Dick whirled with an exclamation, throwing down and back the lever of his
                    Winchester, his face suffused, his eye angry. </p>
                <p>"Damnation!" exclaimed Bolton, anticipating his intention, and springing forward
                    in time to strike up the muzzle of the rifle, though not soon enough to prevent
                    the shot. </p>
                <p>Against the snow, plastered on a distant tree, the bullet hit, scattering the
                    fine powder; then ricochetted, shrieking with increasing joy as it mounted the
                    upper air. After it, as though released by its passage from the spell of the
                    great frost, trooped the voices and echoes of the wilderness. In the still -air
                    such a racket would carry miles. </p>
                <p>Sam looked from the man to the dog. </p>
                <p>"Well, between the two of you!" said he. </p>
                <p>Dick sprang forward, lashing the team with his whip. </p>
                <p>"After him!" he shouted. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0262" n="233"/>
                </p>
                <p>They ran in a swirl of light snow. In a very few moments they came to a bundle of
                    pelts, a little pile of traps, the unnecessary impediments discarded by the man
                    they pursued. So near had they hen to a capture. </p>
                <p>Sam, out of breath, peremptorily called a halt. </p>
                <p>"Hold on!" he commanded. "Take it easy. We can't catch him like this. He's
                    travelling light, and he's one man, and he has a fresh team. He'll pull away
                    from us too easy, and leave us with worn-out dogs." The old man sat and
                    deliberately filled his pipe. </p>
                <p>Dick fumed up and down, chafing at the delay, convinced that something should be
                    done immediately, but at a loss to tell what it should be. </p>
                <p>"What'll we -do, then?" he asked, after a little. </p>
                <p>"He leaves a trail, don't he?" inquired Sam. "We must follow it." </p>
                <p>"But what good-how can we ever catch up?" </p>
                <p>"We've got to throw away our traps and extra duffle. We've got to travel as fast
                    as we can without wearing ourselves out. He may try to go too fast, and so we
                    may wear him down. It's our only show, anyway. If we lose him now, we'll <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0263" n="234"/> never find him again. That trail is
                    all we have to go by." </p>
                <p>"How if it snows hard? It's getting toward spring storms." </p>
                <p>"If it snows hard-well&mdash;" The old man fell silent, puffing away at his
                    pipe. "One thing I want you to understand," he continued, looking up with a
                    sudden sternness, "don't you ever take it on yourself to shoot that gun again.
                    We're to take that man alive. The noise of the shot to-day was a serious thing;
                    it gave Jingoss warning, and perhaps spoiled our chance to surprise him. But he
                    might have heard us anyway. Let that go. But if you'd have killed that hound as
                    you started out to do, you'd have done more harm than your fool head could
                    straighten out in a lifetime. That hound&mdash;why&mdash;he's the best
                    thing we've got. I'd-I'd almost rather lose our rifles than him&mdash;" he
                    trailed off again into rumination. </p>
                <p>Dick, sobered as he always was when his companion took this tone, inquired why,
                    but received no answer. After a moment Sam began to sort the contents of the
                    sledge, casting aside all but the necessities. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0264"
                        n="235"/>
                </p>
                <p>"What's the plan?" Dick ventured. </p>
                <p>"To follow." </p>
                <p>"How long do you think it will be before we catch him?" </p>
                <p>"God knows." </p>
                <p>The dogs leaned into their harness, almost falling forward at the unexpected
                    lightness of the load. Again the little company moved at measured gait. For ten
                    minutes nothing was said. Then Dick: </p>
                <p>"Sam," he said, "I think we have just about as much chance as a snowball in
                    hell." </p>
                <p>"So do I," agreed the old woodsman, soberly. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0265" n="236"/>

                <p>They took up the trail methodically, as though no hurry existed. At the usual
                    time of the evening they camped. Dick was for pushing on an extra hour or so,
                    announcing himself not in the least tired, and the dogs fresh, but Sam would
                    have none of it. </p>
                <p>"It's going to be a long, hard pull," he said. "We're not going to catch up with
                    him to-day, or to-morrow, or next day. It ain't a question of whether you're
                    tired or the dogs are fresh to-night; it's a question of how you're going to be
                    a month from now." </p>
                <p>"We won't be able to follow him a month,," objected Dick. </p>
                <p> "Why?" </p>
                <p> "It'll snow, and then we'll lose th' trail. The spring snows can't be far off
                    now. They'll cover it a foot deep." </p>
                <p>"Mebbe," agreed Sam, inconclusively. </p>
                <p>"Besides," pursued Dick, "he'll be with his own <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0266"
                        n="237"/> people in less than a month, and then there won't be any trail to
                    follow." </p>
                <p>Whereupon Sam looked a little troubled, for this, in his mind, was the chief
                    menace to their success. If Jingoss turned south to the Lake Superior country,
                    he could lose himself among the Ojibways of that region; and, if all remained
                    true to him, the white men would never again be able to get trace of him. <hi
                        rend="italic">If all remained true to him:</hi>-on the chance of that Sam
                    was staking his faith. The Honourable the Hudson's Bay Company has hen
                    established a great many years; it has always treated its Indians justly; it
                    enjoys a tremendous prestige for infallibility. The bonds of race are strong,
                    but the probabilities were good that in the tribes with whom Jingoss would be
                    forced to seek sanctuary would be some members whose loyalty to the Company
                    would out-balance the rather shadowy obligation to a man they had never seen
                    before. Jingoss might be betrayed. The chances of it were fairly good. Sam
                    Bolton knew that the Indian must be perfectly aware of this, and doubted if he
                    would take the risk. A single man with three dogs ought to run away from three
                    pursuers with only four. Therefore, <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0267" n="238"/>
                    the old woodsman thought himself justified in relying at least on the meagre
                    opportunity a stern chase would afford. </p>
                <p>He did not know where the Indian would be likely to lead him. The checker-board
                    of the wilderness lay open. As he had before reflected, it would be only too
                    easy for Jingoss to keep between himself and his pursuers the width of the game.
                    The Northwest was wide; the plains great; the Rocky Mountains lofty and full of
                    hiding-places,&mdash;it seemed likely he would turn west. Or the deep
                    forests of the other coast offered unlimited opportunities of concealment,-the
                    east might well be his choice. It did not matter particularly. Into either it
                    would not be difficult to follow; and Sam hoped in either to gain a sight of his
                    prize before the snow melted. </p>
                <p>The Indian, however, after the preliminary twists and turns of indecision, turned
                    due north. For nearly a week Sam thought this must be a ruse, or a cast by which
                    to gain some route known to Jingoss. But the forests began to dwindle; the
                    muskegs to open. The Land of Little Sticks could not be far distant, and beyond
                    them was the Barren Grounds. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0268" n="239"/> The old
                    woodsman knew the defaulter for a reckless and determined man. Gradually the
                    belief, and at last the conviction, forced itself on him that here he gamed with
                    no cautious player. The Indian was laying on the table the stakes of life or
                    death. He, too, had realised that the test must be one of endurance, and in the
                    superbness of his confidence he had determined not to play with preliminary half
                    measures, but to apply at once the supreme test to himself and his antagonists.
                    He was heading directly out into the winter desert, where existed no game but
                    the single big caribou herd whose pastures were so wide that to meet them would
                    be like encountering a single school of dolphins in all the seven seas. </p>
                <p>As soon as Sam discovered this, he called Dick's attention to it. </p>
                <p>"We're in for it," said he, "he's going to take us out on the Barren Grounds and
                    lose us." </p>
                <p>"if he can," supplemented Dick. </p>
                <p>"Yes, if he can," agreed Sam. After a moment he went on, pursuing his train of
                    thought aloud, as was his habit. </p>
                <p>"He's thinking he has more grub than we have; <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0269"
                        n="240"/> that's about what it amounts to. He thinks he can tire us out. The
                    chances are we'll find no more game. We've got to go on what we have. He's
                    probably got a sledge-load;-and so have we;-but he has only one to feed, and
                    three dogs, and we have three and four dogs." </p>
                <p>"That's all right; he's our Injun," replied Dick, voicing the instinct of race
                    superiority which, after all, does often seem to accomplish the impossible.
                    "It's too bad we have the girl with us.." he added, after a moment. </p>
                <p>"Yes, it is," agreed Sam. Yet it was most significant that now it occurred to
                    neither of them that she might be abandoned. </p>
                <p>The daily supply of provisions was immediately cut to a minimum, and almost at
                    once they felt the effects. The north demands hard work and the greatest
                    resisting power of the vitality; the vitality calls on the body for fuel; and
                    the body in turn insists on food. It is astonishing to see what quantities of
                    nourishment can he absorbed without apparent effect. And when the food is
                    denied, but the vitality is still called upon, it is equally astonishing to see
                    how quickly it takes its revenge. Our travellers <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0270" n="241"/> became lean in two days, dizzy in a
                    week, tired to the last fibre, on the edge of exhaustion. They took care,
                    however, not to step over that edge. </p>
                <p>Sam Bolton saw to it. His was not only the bodily labour, but the mental anxiety.
                    His attitude was the tenseness of a helmsman in a heavy wind, quivering to the
                    faintest indication, ready to give her all she will hear, but equally ready to
                    luff this side of disaster. Only his equable mind could have resisted an almost
                    overpowering impulse toward sporadic bursts of speed or lengthening of hours. He
                    had much of this to repress in Dick. But on the other band he watched zealously
                    against the needless waste of even a single second. Every expedient his long
                    woods life or his native ingenuity suggested he applied at once to the problem
                    of the greatest speed, the least expenditure of energy to a given end., the
                    smallest consumption of food compatible with the preservation of strength. The
                    legitimate travel of a day might amount to twenty or thirty miles. Sam added an
                    extra five or ten to them. And that five or ten he drew from the living tissues
                    of his very life. They were a creation, made from nothing, given a body by the
                    individual genius of the <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0271" n="242"/> man. The
                    drain cut down his nervous energy, made him lean, drew the anxious lines of an
                    incipient exhaustion across his brow. </p>
                <p>At first, as may be gathered, the advantages of the game seemed to be strongly in
                    the Indian's favour. The food supply, the transportation facilities, and
                    advantage of position in case game should be encountered were all his. Against
                    him he need count seriously only the offset of dogged Anglo-Saxon grit. But as
                    the travel defined itself, certain compensations made themselves evident. </p>
                <p>Direct warfare was impossible to him. He possessed only a single-barrelled
                    muzzle-loading gun of no great efficiency. In case of ambush he might, with
                    luck, be able to kill one of his pursuers, but he would indubitably be captured
                    by the other. He would be unable to approach them at night hocus of their dogs.
                    His dog-team was stronger, but with it he had to break trail, which the others
                    could utilise without further effort. Even should his position in advance bring
                    him on game, without great luck, he would he unable to kill it, for he was alone
                    and could not leave his team for long. And his very swiftness in itself would
                    react against him, for he <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0272" n="243"/> was
                    continually under the temptation daily to exceed by a little his powers. </p>
                <p>These considerations the white men at first could not see; and so, logically,
                    they were more encouraged by them when at last they did appear. And then in
                    turn, by natural reaction when the glow had died, the great discouragement of
                    the barren places fell on their spirits. They plodded, seeing no further than
                    their daily necessity of travel. They plodded, their eyes fixed to the trail,
                    which led always on toward the pole star, undeviating, as a deer flies in a
                    straight line hoping to shake off the wolves. </p>
                <p>The dense forest growth was succeeded in time by the low spruce and poplar
                    thickets; these in turn by the open reaches planted like a park with the pointed
                    firs. Then came the Land of Little Sticks, and so on out into the vast whiteness
                    of the true North, where the trees are liliputian and the spaces gigantic beyond
                    the measures of the earth; where living things dwindle to the significance of
                    black specks on a limitless field of white, and the aurora crackles and shoots
                    and spreads and threatens Eke a great inimical and magnificent spirit. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0273" n="244"/>
                </p>
                <p>The tendency seemed toward a mighty simplification, as though the complexities of
                    the world were reverting toward their original philosophic unity. The complex
                    summer had become simple autumn; the autumn, winter; now the very winter itself
                    was apparently losing its differentiations of bushes and trees, hills and
                    valleys, streams and living things. The growths were disappearing; the hills
                    were flattening toward the great northern wastes; the rare creatures inhabiting
                    these barrens took on the colour of their environment. The ptarmigan matched the
                    snow,&mdash;the fox,&mdash;the ermine. They moved either invisible or as
                    ghosts. </p>
                <p>Little by little such dwindling of the materials for diverse observation, in
                    alliance with the too severe labour and the starving, brought about a strange
                    concentration of ideas. The inner world seemed to undergo the same process of
                    simplification as the outer. Extraneous considerations disappeared. The entire
                    cosmos of experience came to be an expanse of white, themselves, and the Trail.
                    These three reacted one on the other, and outside of them there was no reaction. </p>
                <p>In the expanse of white was no food: their food <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0274"
                        n="245"/> was dwindling; the Trail led on into barren lands where no food
                    was to he had. That was the circle that whirled insistent in their brains. </p>
                <p>At night they sank down, felled by the sheer burden of weariness, and no matter
                    bow exhausted they might be the Trail continued, springing on with the same
                    apparently tireless energy toward its unknown goal in the North. Gradually they
                    lost sight of the ultimate object of their quest. It became obscured by the
                    immediate object, and that was the following of the Trail. They forgot that a
                    man had made it, or if for a moment it did occur to them that it was the product
                    of some agency outside of and above itself, that agent loomed vaguely as a
                    mysterious, extra-human power, like the winds or the cold or the great
                    Wilderness itself. It did not seem possible that he could feel the need for
                    food, for rest, that ever his vital forces could wane. In the north was
                    starvation for them, a starvation to which they drew ever nearer day by day, but
                    irresistibly the notion obsessed them that this forerunner, the forerunner of
                    the Trail, proved no such material necessities, that he drew his sustenance from
                    his environment in some mysterious manner not to he understood. Al <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0275" n="246"/> ways on and on and on the Trail was
                    destined to lead them until they died, and then the maker of it, -not Jingoss,
                    not the Weasel, the defaulter, the man of flesh and blood and nerves and
                    thoughts and the capacities for suffering,&mdash;but a Heinz elusive as the
                    aurora, an embodiment of that dread country, a servant of the unfriendly North,
                    would return as he had done. </p>
                <p>Over the land lay silence. The sea has its undertone on the stillest nights; the
                    woods are quiet with an hundred lesser noises; but here was absolute,
                    terrifying, smothering silence,&mdash;the suspension of all sound, even the
                    least,&mdash;looming like a threatening cloud larger and more dreadful above
                    the cowering imagination. The human soul demanded to shriek aloud in order to
                    preserve its sanity, and yet a whisper uttered over against the heavy portent of
                    this universal stillness seemed a profanation that left the spirit crouched
                    beneath a fear of retribution. And then suddenly the aurora, the only privileged
                    voice, would crackle like a silken banner. </p>
                <p>At first the world in the vastness of its spaces seemed to become bigger and
                    bigger. Again abruptly it resumed its normal proportions, but <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0276" n="247"/> they, the observers of it, had hen
                    struck small. To their own minds they seemed like little black insects crawling
                    painfully. In the distance these insects crawled was a disproportion to the
                    energy expended, a disproportion disheartening, filling the soul with the
                    despair of an accomplishment that could mean anything in the following of that
                    which made the Trail. </p>
                <p>Always they ate pemmican. Of this there remained a fairly plentiful supply, but
                    the dog meat was running low. It was essential that the team be well fed. Dick
                    or Sam often travelled the entire day a quarter of a mile one side or the other,
                    hoping thus to encounter game, but without much success. A fox or so, a few
                    ptarmigan, that was all. These they saved for the dogs. Three times a day they
                    boiled tea and devoured the little square of pemmican. It did not supply the
                    bulk their digestive organs needed, and became in time almost nauseatingly
                    unpalatable, but it nourished. That, after all, was the main thing. The
                    privation carved the flesh from their muscles, carved the muscles themselves to
                    leanness. </p>
                <p>But in spite of the best they could do, the dog <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0277"
                        n="248"/> feed ran out. There remained but one thing to do. Already the
                    sledge was growing lighter, and three dogs would be quite adequate for the work.
                    They killed Wolf, the surly and stupid "husky." Every scrap they saved, even to
                    the entrails, which froze at once to solidity. The remaining dogs were put on
                    half rations, just sufficient to keep up their strength. The starvation told on
                    their tempers. Especially did Claire, the sledge-dog, heavy with young, and
                    ravenous to feed their growth, wander about like a spirit, whining mournfully
                    and sniffing the barren breeze. </p>

                <p>The journey extended over a month. The last three weeks of it were starvation. At
                    first this meant merely discomfort and the hearing of a certain amount of pain.
                    Later it became acute suffering. Later still it developed into a necessity for
                    proving what virtue resided in the bottom of these men's souls. I </p>
                <p>Perforce now they must make a choice of what ideas they would keep. Some things
                    must be given up, just as some things had to he discarded when they had
                    lightened the sledge. All the lesser lumber had long since gone. Certain bigger
                    things still remained. </p>
                <p>They held grimly to the idea of catching the Indian. Their natural love of life
                    held tenaciously to a hope of return. An equally natural hope clung to the
                    ridiculous idea that the impossible might happen, that the needle should drop
                    from the haystack, that the caribou might spring into their view from <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0279" n="250"/> the emptiness of space. Now it seemed
                    that they must make a choice between the first two. </p>
                <p>"Dick," said Bolton, solemnly, "we've mighty little pemmican left. If we turn
                    around now, it'll just about get us back to the woods. If we go on farther,
                    we'll have to run into more food, or we'll never get out." </p>
                <p>"I knew it," replied Dick. </p>
                <p>"Well ?" </p>
                <p>Dick looked at him astonished. "Well, what?" he inquired. </p>
                <p>"Shall we give it up?" </p>
                <p>"Give it up!" cried the young man. "Of course not; what you thinking of?" </p>
                <p>"There's the caribou," suggested Sam, doubtfully; "or maybe Jingoss has more grub
                    than he's going to need. It's a slim chance." </p>
                <p>They still further reduced the ration of pemmican. The malnutrition began to play
                    them tricks. It dizzied their brains, swarmed the vastness with hordes of
                    little, dancing black specks like mosquitoes. In the morning every muscle of
                    their bodies was stiffened to the consistency of rawhide, and the movements
                    necessary to loosen the fibres became an <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0280"
                        n="251"/> agony hardly to he endured. Nothing of voluntary consciousness
                    remained, could remain, but the effort of lifting the feet, driving the dogs,
                    following the Trail; but involuntary consciousness lent them strange
                    hallucinations. They saw figures moving across the snow, but when they steadied
                    their vision, nothing was there. </p>
                <p>They began to stumble over nothing; occasionally to fall. In this was added
                    effort, but more particularly added annoyance. They had continually to watch
                    their footsteps. The walking was no longer involuntary, but they had definitely
                    to think of each movement necessary to the step, and this gave them a further
                    reason for preoccupation, for concentration. Dick's sullenness returned, more
                    terrible than in the summer. He went forward with his head down, refusing to
                    take notice of anything. He walked: that was to him the whole of existence. </p>
                <p>Once reverting analogously to his grievance of that time, he mentioned the girl,
                    saying briefly that soon they must all die, and it was better that she die now.
                    Perhaps her share of the pemmican would bring them to their quarry. . The idea
                    of return-not abandoned, but persistently ignored <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0281" n="252"/> thrust into prominence this
                    other,&mdash;to come to close quarters with the man they pursued, to die
                    grappled with him, dragging him down to the same death by which these three
                    perished. But Sam would have none of it, and Dick easily dropped the subject,
                    relapsing into his grim monomania of pursuit. </p>
                <p>In Dick's case even the hope of coming to grapples was fading. He somehow had
                    little faith in his enemy. The man was too intangible, too difficult to gauge.
                    Dick had not caught a glimpse of the Indian since the pursuit began. The young
                    man realised perfectly his own exhaustion; but he had no means of knowing
                    whether or not the Indian was tiring. His faith waned, though his determination
                    did not. Unconsciously he substituted this monomania of pursuit. It took the
                    place of the faith he felt slipping from him-the faith that ever he would see
                    the fata morgana luring him out into the Silent Places. </p>
                <p>Soon it became necessary to kill another dog. Dick, with a remnant of his old
                    feeling, pleaded for the life of Billy, his pet. Sam would not entertain for a
                    moment the destruction of the hound. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0282" n="253"/>
                    There remained only Claire, the sledge-dog, with her pathetic brown eyes, and
                    her affectionate ways of the female dog. They went to kill her, and discovered
                    her in the act of defending the young to which she had just given birth. Near at
                    hand crouched Mack and Billy, their eyes red with famine, their jaws a-slaver,
                    eager to devour the newborn puppies. And in the grim and dreadful sight Sam
                    Bolton seemed at last to glimpse the face of his terrible antagonist. </p>
                <p>They heat back the dogs, and took the puppies. These they killed and dressed.
                    Thus Claire's life was bought for her by the sacrifice of her progeny. </p>
                <p>But even that was a temporary respite. She fell in her turn, and was devoured, to
                    the last scrap of her hide. Dick again intervened to save Billy, but, failed.
                    Sam issued his orders the more peremptorily as he felt his strength waning, and
                    realised the necessity of economising every ounce of it, even to that required
                    in the arguing of expedients. Dick yielded with slight resistance, as he had
                    yielded in the case of the girl. All matters but the one were rapidly becoming
                    unimportant to him. That concentration <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0283" n="254"
                    /> of his forces which represented the weapon of his greatest utility, was
                    gradually taking place. He was becoming an engine of dogged determination, an
                    engine whose burden the older man had long carried on his shoulders, but which
                    now he was preparing to launch when his own strength should be gone. </p>
                <p>At last there was left but the one dog, Mack, the hound, with the wrinkled face
                    and the long, hanging ears. He developed unexpected endurance and an entire
                    willingness, pulling strongly on the sledge, waiting in patience for his scanty
                    meal, searching the faces of his, masters with his wise brown eyes, dumbly
                    sympathetic in a trouble whose entirety he could not understand. </p>
                <p>The two men took turns in harnessing themselves to the sledge with Mark. The girl
                    followed at the gee-pole. </p>
                <p>May-may-gw&aacute;n showed the endurance of a man. She made no complaint.
                    Always she followed, and followed with her mind alert. Where Dick shut
                    obstinately his faculties within the bare necessity of travel, she and her other
                    companion were continually alive to the possibilities of expedient. This <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0284" n="255"/> constituted an additional slight but
                    constant drain on their vital forces. </p>
                <p>Starvation gained on them. Perceptibly their strength was waning. Dick wanted to
                    kill the other dog. His argument was plausible. The toboggan was now very light.
                    The men could draw it. They would have the dog-meat to recruit their strength. </p>
                <p>Sam shook his head. Dick insisted. He even threatened force. But then the
                    woodsman roused his old-time spirit and fairly heat the young man into
                    submission by the vehemence of his anger. The effort left him exhausted. He sank
                    back into himself, and refused, in the apathy of weariness, to give any
                    explanation. </p>

                <p>By now it was the first week in March. The weather began to assume a new aspect.
                    During the winter months it had not snowed, for the moisture had all hen
                    squeezed from the air, leaving it crisp, brilliant, sparkling. Now the sun, long
                    hesitant, at last began to swing up the sky. Far south the warmer airs of spring
                    were awakening the Kansas fields. Here in the barren country the steel sky
                    melted to a haze. During the day, when the sun was up, the surface of the snow
                    even softened a little, and a very perceptible warmth allowed them to rest,
                    their parkas thrown back, without discomfort. </p>
                <p>The men noticed this, and knew it as the precursor of the spring snow-fall. Dick
                    grew desperately uneasy, desperately anxious to push on, to catch up before the
                    complete obliteration of the trail, when his resources would perforce run out
                    for lack of an object to which to apply them. He knew perfectly well that this
                    must be what the Indian had <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0286" n="257"/>
                    anticipated, the reason why he had dared to go out into the barren grounds, and
                    to his present helpless lack of a further expedient the defaulter's confidence
                    in the natural sequence seemed only too well justified. Sam remained
                    inscrutable. </p>
                <p>The expected happened late one afternoon. All day the haze had thickened, until
                    at last, without definite transition, it had become a cloud covering the entire
                    sky. Then it had snowed. The great, clogging flakes sifted down gently,
                    ziz-zagging through the air like so many pieces of paper. They impacted softly
                    against the world, standing away from each other and from the surface on which
                    they alighted by the full stretch of their crystal arms. In an hour three inches
                    had fallen. The hollows and depressions were filling to the level; the Trail was
                    growing indistinct. </p>
                <p>Dick watched from the shelter of a growing despair. Never had he felt so
                    helpless. This thing was so simple, yet so effective; and nothing he could do
                    would nullify its results. As sometimes in a crisis a man will give his whole
                    attention to a trivial thing, so Dick fastened his gaze on a single snowshoe
                    track on the edge of a covered bowlder. By it <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0287"
                        n="258"/> he gauged the progress of the storm. When at last even his
                    imagination could not differentiate it from the surface on either side, he
                    looked up. The visible world was white and smooth and level. No faintest trace
                    of the Trail remained. East, west, north, south, lay uniformity. The Indian had
                    disappeared utterly from the face of the earth. </p>
                <p>The storm lightened and faint streaks of light shot through the clouds. </p>
                <p>"Well, let's he moving," said Sam. </p>
                <p>"Moving where?" demanded Dick, bitterly. </p>
                <p>But the old man led forward the bound </p>
                <p>"Remember the lake where we lost the track of that Chippewa?" he inquired. "Well,
                    a foot of light snow is nothing. Mush on, Mack!" </p>
                <p>The hound sniffed deep, filling his nostrils with the feather snow, which
                    promptly he sneezed out. Then he swung off easily on his little dog-trot, never
                    at fault, never hesitant, picking up the turns and twistings of the Indian's
                    newer purpose as surely as a mind-reader the concealed pin. </p>
                <p>For Jingoss had hen awaiting eagerly this fall of snow, as this immediate change
                    of direction showed. He was sure that now they could no longer </p>

                <p>follow him. It was for this he had lured them farther and farther into the
                    wilderness, waiting for the great enemy of them all to cover his track, to throw
                    across his vanishing figure her ultimate denial of their purposes. At once,
                    convinced of his safety, he turned to the west and southwest. </p>
                <p>At just what moment he discovered that he was still followed it was impossible to
                    determine. But very shortly a certain indecision could he read in the signs of
                    his journeying. He turned to the south, changed his mind, doubled on his tracks
                    like a rabbit, finally, his purpose decided, he shot away on the direct line
                    again for the frozen reaches of desolation in the north. </p>
                <p>The moment's flicker of encouragement lighted by the success of the dog, fell
                    again to blackness as the three faced further incursion into the land of
                    starvation. They had allowed themselves for a moment to believe that the Indian
                    might now have reached the limit of his intention; that now he might turn toward
                    a chance at least of life. But this showed that his purpose, or obstinacy or
                    madness remained unchanged, and this newer proof indicated that it possessed a
                    depth of de <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0291" n="260"/> termination that might
                    lead to any extreme. They had to readjust themselves to the idea. Perforce they
                    had to extend their faith, had to believe in the caribou herds. From every
                    little rise they looked abroad, insisting on a childish confidence in the
                    existence of game. They could not afford to take the reasonable view, could not
                    afford to estimate the chances against their encountering in all that vastness
                    of space the single pin-point where grazed abundance. </p>
                <p>From time to time, thereafter, the snow fell. On the mere fact of their
                    persistence it had little effect; but it clogged their snow-shoes, it wore them
                    down. A twig tripped them; and the efforts of all three were needed to aid one
                    to rise. A dozen steps were all they could accomplish without rest; a dozen
                    short, stumbling steps that were, nevertheless, so many mile-posts in the
                    progress to their final exhaustion. When one fell, he lay huddled, unable at
                    once to rally his vital forces to attempt the exertion of regaining his feet.
                    The day's journey was pitifully short, pitifully inadequate to the imperious
                    demands of that onward-leading Trail, and yet each day's journey lessened the
                    always desperate <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0292" n="261"/> chance of a return
                    to the game country. in spite of that, it never again crossed their minds that
                    it might be well to abandon the task. They might die, but it would be on the
                    Trail, and the death clutch of their fingers would still be extended toward the
                    north, where dwelt their enemy, and into whose protective arms their quarry had
                    fled. </p>
                <p>As his strength ebbed Dick Herron's energies concentrated more and more to his
                    monomania of pursuit. The round, full curves of his body had shrunken to angles,
                    the fresh tints of his skin had turned to leather, the flesh of his cheeks had
                    sunken, his teeth showed in the drawing back of his lips. All these signs spoke
                    of exhaustion and of ultimate collapse. But as the case grew more desperate, he
                    seemed to discover in some unsuspected quality of his spirit, or perhaps merely
                    of his youth, a fitful and wonderful power. He collapsed from weakness, to be
                    sure; but in a moment his iron will, apparently angered to incandescence, got
                    him to his feet and on his way with an excess of energy. He helped the others.
                    He urged the dog. And then slowly the fictitious vigour ran out. The light, the
                    red, terrible glare of madness, faded from his eye; <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0293" n="262"/> it became glazed and lifeless; his
                    shoulders dropped; his head bung; he fell. </p>
                <p>Gradually in the transition period between the darkness of winter and the coming
                    of spring the world took on an unearthly aspect. It became an inferno' of light
                    without corresponding warmth, of blinding, flaring, intolerable light reflected
                    from the snow. It became luminous, as though the ghosts of the ancient days of
                    incandescence had revisited the calendar. It was raw, new, huge, uncouth,
                    embryonic, adapted to the production of tremendous monsters, unfit for the
                    habitation of tiny men with delicate physical and mental adjustments. Only to
                    the mind of a Caliban could it be other than terrifying. Things grew to a size
                    out of all reason. The horizon was infinitely remote, lost in snow-mists,
                    fearful with the large-blown mirages of little things. Strange and indeterminate
                    somethings menaced on all sides, menaced in greater and greater threat, until
                    with actual proximity they mysteriously disappeared, leaving behind them as a
                    blind to conceal their real identity such small matters as a stunted shrub, an
                    exposed rock, the shadow of a wind-rift on the snow. And low in the sky danced
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0294" n="263"/> in unholy revel the suns,
                    sometimes as many as eight of them, gazing with the abandoned red eyes of
                    debauchees on the insignificant travellers groping feebly amid phantasmagoria. </p>
                <p>The great light, the dazzle, the glitter, the incessant movement of the mirages,
                    the shining of the mock suns, all these created an impression of heat, of light,
                    of the pleasantness of a warmed land. Yet still persisted, only modified by the
                    sun, the cold of the northern winter. And this denial of appearance sufficed to
                    render unreal all the round globe, so that at any moment the eye anticipated its
                    crumbling like a dust apple, with its cold, its vastness, its emptiness, its
                    hunger, its indecently many suns, leaving the human soul in the abyss of space.
                    The North threw over them the power of her spell, so that to them the step from
                    life to death seemed a short, an easy, a natural one to take. </p>
                <p>Nevertheless their souls made struggle, as did their bodies. They fought down the
                    feeling of illusion just as they had fought down the feelings of hunger, of
                    weariness, and of cold. Sam fashioned rough wooden spectacles with tiny
                    transverse slits through which to look, and these they assumed <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0295" n="264"/> against the snow-blindness. They kept
                    a sharp watch for freezing. Already their faces were blackened and parched by
                    the frost, and cracked through the thick skin down to the raw. Sam had frozen
                    his great toe, and had with his knife cut to the bone in order to prevent
                    mortification. They tried to talk a little in order to combat by unison of
                    spirit the dreadful influence the North was bringing to hear. They gained ten
                    feet as a saint of the early church gained his soul for paradise. </p>
                <p>Now it came to the point where they could no longer afford to eat their pemmican.
                    They boiled it, along with strips of the rawhide dog-harness, and drank the
                    soup. It sufficed not at all to appease the pain of their hunger, nor
                    appreciably did it give them strength, but somehow it fed the vital spark. They
                    endured fearful cramps. So far had their faculties lost vigour that only by a
                    distinct effort of the will could they focus their eyes to the examination of
                    any object. </p>
                <p>Their obsessions of mind were now two. They followed the Trail; they looked for
                    the caribou herds. After a time the improbability became tenuous. They actually
                    expected the impossible, felt <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0296" n="265"/>
                    defrauded at not obtaining it, cried out weakly against their ill fortune in not
                    encountering the herd that was probably two thousand miles away. In its
                    withholding the North seemed to play unfairly. She denied them the chances of
                    the game. </p>
                <p>And the Trail! Not the freezing nor the starvation nor the illusion were so
                    potent in the deeper discouragement of the spirit as that. Always it led on.
                    They could see it; they could see its direction; that was all. Tireless it ran
                    on and on and on. For all they knew the Indian, hearty and confident in his
                    wilderness strength, might be watching them at every moment, laughing at the
                    feeble thirty feet their pain bought them, gliding on swiftly in an hour farther
                    than they could travel in a day. This possibility persisted until, in their
                    minds, it became the fact. They endowed their enemy with all they themselves
                    lacked; with strength, with swiftness, with the sustenance of life. Yet never
                    for a moment did it occur to them to abandon the pursuit. </p>
                <p>Sam was growing uncertain in his movements; Dick was plainly going mad. The girl
                    followed; that was all one could say, for whatever suffering <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0297" n="266"/> she proved was hidden beneath race
                    stolidity, and I more nobly beneath a great devotion. </p>
                <p>And then late one afternoon they came to a bloody spot on the snow. Here Jingoss
                    had killed. Here he had found what had hen denied them, what they needed so
                    sorely. The North was on his side. He now had meat in plenty, and meat meant
                    strength, and strength meant swiftness, and swiftness meant the safety of this
                    world for him and the certainty of the next for them. The tenuous hope that had
                    persisted through all the psychological pressure the North had brought to hear,
                    the hope that they had not even acknowledged to themselves, the hope based
                    merely on the circumstance that they did not <hi rend="italic">know,</hi> was
                    routed by this one fact. Now they could no longer shelter behind the flimsy
                    screen of an ignorance of their enemy's condition. They knew. The most profound
                    discouragement descended on them. </p>
                <p>But even yet they did not yield to the great antagonist. The strength of meat
                    lacked them: the strength of despair remained. A rapid dash might bring them to
                    grapples. And somewhere in the depths of their indomitable spirits, somewhere in
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0298" n="267"/> the line of their hardy,
                    Anglo-Saxon descent, they knew they would find the necessary vitality. </p>
                <p>Stars glittered like sparks on polished steel. On the northwest wind swooped the
                    chill of the winter's end, and in that chill was the breath of the North. Sam
                    Bolton, crushed by the weight of a great exhaustion, recognised the familiar
                    menace, and raised his head, gazing long from glazed eyes out into the Silent
                    Places. </p>
                <p>"Not yet!" he said aloud. </p>

                <p>But the next morning he was unable to rise. The last drop of his vitality had run
                    out. At length the connection between his will and his body had hen severed, so
                    that the latter was no longer under his command. After the first moment he knew
                    well enough what this meant, knew that here he must die, here he must lie
                    crushed finally under the sheer weight of his antagonist. It was as though she,
                    the great North, had heard his defiant words the night before, and thus proved
                    to him their emptiness. </p>
                <p>And yet the last reserves of the old man's purpose were not yet destroyed. Here
                    he must remain, it is true, but still he possessed next his hand the human
                    weapon he had carried so far and so painfully by the exercise of his ingenuity
                    and the genius of his long experience. He had staggered under its burden as far
                    as he could; now was the moment for launching it. He called the young man to
                    him. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0300" n="269"/>
                </p>
                <p>"I cannot go on," said he, in gasps. "Leave the sledge. Take the dog. Do not lose
                    him. Travel fast. You must get him by to-morrow night. Sleep some to-night.
                    Travel fast." </p>
                <p>Dick nodded. He understood. Already the scarlet hate, the dogged mad glare of a
                    set purpose was glazing his vision. It was the sprint at the end of the race. He
                    need no longer save himself. </p>
                <p>He took a single blanket and the little shreds of dog meat that remained. Some of
                    the pemmican, a mere scrap, he left with Sam. Mack he held in leash. </p>
                <p>"I will live five days," went on Sam, "perhaps six. I will try to live. If you
                    should come back in that time,&mdash;with meat-the caribou-you understand."
                    His voice trailed away, unwilling to mock the face of probability with such a
                    chance. </p>
                <p>Dick nodded again. He had nothing to say. He wrung the old man's hand and turned
                    away. </p>
                <p>Mack thrust his nose forward. They started. </p>
                <p>Sam, left alone, rolled himself again in his thick coverings under the snow,
                    which would protect him from the night cold. There he would lie absolutely
                    motionless, hoarding the drops of his life. From <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0301" n="270"/> time to time, at long intervals, he
                    would taste the pemmican. And characteristically enough, his regret, his sorrow,
                    was, not that he must be left to perish, not even that he must acknowledge
                    himself beaten, but that he was deprived of the chance for this last desperate
                    dash before death stooped. </p>
                <p>When Dick stepped out on the trail, May-may-gw&aacute;n followed. After a
                    moment he took cognisance of the crunch of her snow-shoes behind him. He turned
                    and curtly ordered her back. She persisted. Again he turned, his face nervous
                    with all the strength he had summoned for the final effort, shouting at her
                    hoarsely, laying on her the anger of his command. She seemed not to hear him. He
                    raised his fist and heat her, hitting her again and again, finally reaching her
                    face. She went down silently, without even a moan. But when he stared back
                    again, after the next dozen steps, she had risen and was still tottering on
                    along the Trail. </p>
                <p>He threw his hands up with a gesture of abandonment. Then without a word, grim
                    and terrible, he put his head down and started. </p>
                <p>He never looked back. Madness held him. Finesse, saving, the crafty utilising of
                    small advantages <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0302" n="271"/> had had their day.
                    It was the moment for brute strength. All day he swung on in a swirl of snow,
                    tireless. The landscape swam about him, the white glare searched out the inmost
                    painful recesses of his brain. He knew enough to keep his eyes shut most of the
                    time, trusting to Mack. At noon he divided accurately the entire food supply
                    with the animal. At night he fasted. The two, man and dog, slept huddled close
                    together for the sake of the warmth. At midnight the girl crept in broken and
                    exhausted. </p>
                <p>The next day Dick was as wonderful. A man strong in meat could not have travelled
                    so. The light snow whirled behind him in a cloud. The wind of his going strained
                    the capote from his emaciated face. So, in the nature of the man, he would go
                    until the end. Then he would give out all at once, would fall from full life to
                    complete dissolution of forces. Behind him, pitifully remote, pitifully bent,
                    struggling futilely, obsessed by a mania as strong as that of these madmen who
                    persisted even beyond the end of all things, was the figure of the girl. She
                    could not stand upright, she could not breathe, yet she, too, followed the
                    Trail, that dread <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0303" n="272"/> symbol of so many
                    hopes and ideals and despairs. Dick did not notice her, did not remember her
                    existence, any more than he remembered the existence of Sam Bolton, of trees, of
                    streams, of summer and warm winds, of the world, of the devil, of God, of
                    himself. </p>
                <p>All about him the landscape swayed like mist; the suns danced indecent revel;
                    specks and blotches, the beginning of snow-blindness, swam grotesquely projected
                    into a world less real than they. Living things moved everywhere. Ordinarily the
                    man paid no attention to them, knowing them for what they, were, but once,
                    warned by some deep and subtle instinct, he made the effort to clear his vision
                    and saw a fox. By another miracle he killed it. The carcass he divided with his
                    dog. He gave none of it to the girl. </p>
                <p>I By evening of the second day he had not yet overtaken his quarry. But the trail
                    was evidently fresher, and the fox's meat gave him another chance. He slept, as
                    before, with Mack the hound; and, as before, May-may-gw&aacute;n crept in
                    hours later to fall exhausted. </p>
                <p>And over the three figures, lying as dead, the <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0304"
                        n="273"/> North whirred in the wind, waiting to stoop, triumphing, glorying
                    that she had brought the boasts of men to nothing. </p>

                <p>The next morning was the third day. There was no delay in getting started. All
                    Dick had to do was to roll his blanket. He whirled on, still with his impetuous,
                    fictitious vigour unimpaired. The girl staggered after him ten feet, then
                    pitched forward. He turned uncertainly. She reached out to touch him. Her eyes
                    said a farewell. It was the end. </p>
                <p>Dick stood a moment, his eyes vague. Then mechanically he put his head down,
                    mechanically he looked for the Trail, mechanically he shot away alone, alone
                    except for the faithful, gaunt hound, the only thing that remained to him out of
                    a whole world of living beings. </p>
                <p>To his fevered vision the Trail was becoming fresher. Every step he took gave him
                    the impression of so much gained, as though the man he was in pursuit of was
                    standing still waiting to he taken. For the first time in months the conviction
                    of absolute success took possession of him. His sight <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0306" n="275"/> cleared, his heart heat strong, his
                    whole Heinz quivered with vigour. The illusion of the North faded away like a
                    mist. The world was a flat plain of snow, With here and there a stunted spruce,
                    knee-high, protruding above it, and with here and there an inequality of hidden
                    bowlders and rounded knolls. Far off was the horizon, partially hidden in the
                    normal snow-fog of this time of year. All objects were stationary, solid,
                    permanent. Even the mock suns were only what was to he expected in so high a
                    latitude. Dick was conscious of arguing these things to himself with
                    extraordinary accuracy of logic. He proved a glow of happiness in the clarity of
                    his brain, in the ease of his body, in the certainty of his success. The candle
                    flared clear before its expiration. </p>
                <p>For some moments he enjoyed this feeling of well-Heinz, then a disturbing element
                    insinuated itself. At first it was merely an uneasiness, which he could not
                    place, a vague and nebulous irritation, a single crumpled rose-leaf. Then it
                    grew to the proportions of a menace which banked his horizon with thunder,
                    though the sun still shone overhead. Finally it became a terror, clutching him
                    at the <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0307" n="276"/> throat. He seemed to feel the
                    need of identifying it. By an effort he recognised it as a lack. Something was
                    missing without which there was for him no success, no happiness, no well-Heinz,
                    no strength, no existence. That something he must find. In the search his soul
                    descended again to the region of dread, the regions of phantasmagoria. The earth
                    heaved and rocked and swam in a sea of cold and glaring light. Strange
                    creatures, momentarily changing shape and size, glided monstrous across the
                    middle distance. The mock suns danced in the heavens. </p>
                <p>Twice he stopped short and listened. In his brain the lack war, defining itself
                    as the lack of a sound. It was something he had always hen used to. Now it had
                    hen taken away. The world was silent in its deprivation, and the silence stifled
                    him. It had hen something so usual that he had never noticed it; its absence
                    called it to his attention for the first time. So far in the circle his mind
                    ran; then swung back. He heat his forehead. Great as were the sufferings of his
                    body, they were as nothing compared with these unreal torturings of his maddened
                    brain. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0308" n="277"/>
                </p>
                <p>For the third time he stopped, his head sidewise in the attitude of listening. At
                    once easily, without effort, he knew. All these months behind him had sounded
                    the <hi rend="italic">crunch</hi> of snow-shoes. All these months about him,
                    wrapping him so softly that he had never hen conscious of it, had hen the
                    worship of a great devotion. Now they were taken away, he missed them. His
                    spirit, great to withstand the hardships of the body, strong to deny itself, so
                    that even at the last he had resisted the temptation of hunger and divided with
                    his dog, in its weakened condition could not stand the exposure to the
                    loneliness, to the barren winds of a peopleless world. A long minute he stood,
                    listening, demanding against all reason to hear the <hi rend="italic">crunch,
                        crunch, crunch</hi> that should tell him he was not alone. Then, without a
                    glance at the Trail he had followed so long, he turned back. </p>

                <p>The girl was lying face down as he had left her. Already the windrow of the snow
                    was beginning to form, like the curve of a wave about to break over her
                    prostrate body. He sat down beside her, and gathered her into his arms, throwing
                    the thick three-point blanket with its warm lining over the bent forms of both.
                    At once it was as though he had always hen there, his back to the unceasing
                    winds, a permanence in the wilderness. The struggles of the long, long trail
                    withdrew swiftly into the past they had never hen. And through the unreality of
                    this feeling shot a single illuminating shaft of truth: never would he find in
                    himself the power to take the trail again. The bubbling fever-heights of his
                    energies suddenly drained away. </p>
                <p>Mack, the hound, lay patiently at his feet. He, too, suffered, and he did not
                    understand, but that did not matter; his faithfulness could not doubt. For a
                    single instant it occurred to the young man <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0310"
                        n="279"/> that he might kill the dog, and so procure nourishment with which
                    to extricate himself and the girl; but the thought drifted idly through his
                    mind, and so on and away. It did not matter. He could never again follow that
                    Trail, and a few days more or less </p>
                <p>The girl sighed and opened her eyes. They widened. </p>
                <p>"Jibiw&aacute;nisi !" she whispered. </p>
                <p>Her eyes remained fixed on his face, puzzling out the mere facts. Then all at
                    once they softened. </p>
                <p>"You came back," she murmured. </p>
                <p>Dick did not reply. He drew her a little closer into his arms. </p>
                <p>For a long time they said nothing. Then the girl: , </p>
                <p>"It has come, Jibiw&aacute;nisi , we must die," and after a moment, "You came
                    back." </p>
                <p>She closed her eyes again, happily. </p>
                <p>"Why did you come back?" she asked after a while. </p>
                <p>"I do not know," said Dick. </p>
                <p>The snow sifted here and there like beach sand. Occasionally the dog shook
                    himself free of it, but <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0311" n="280"/> over the two
                    human beings it flung, little by little, the whiteness of its uniformity, a warm
                    mantle against the freezing. They became an integral part of the landscape,
                    permanent as it, coeval with its rocks and hills, ancient as the world, a symbol
                    of obscure passions and instincts and spiritual beauties old as the human race. </p>
                <p>Abruptly Dick spoke, his voice harsh. </p>
                <p>"We die here, Little Sister. I do not regret. I have done the best in me. It is
                    well for me to die. But this is not your affair. It was not for you to give your
                    life. Had you not followed you would now be warm in the wigwams of your people.
                    This is heavy on my heart." </p>
                <p>"Was it for this you came back to me?" she inquired. </p>
                <p>Dick considered. "No," he replied. </p>
                <p>"The south wind blows warm on me," she said, after a moment. </p>
                <p>The man thought her mind wandered with the starvation, but this was not the case.
                    Her speech had made one of those strange lapses into rhetoric so common to the
                    savage peoples. </p>
                <p>"Jibiw&aacute;nisi ," she went on solemnly, "to me now <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0312" n="281"/> this is a land where the trees are
                    green and the waters flow and the sun shines and the fat deer are in the
                    grasses. My heart sings like the birds. What should I care for dying? It is well
                    to die when one is happy." </p>
                <p>"Are you happy, May-may-gw&aacute;n?" asked Dick. </p>
                <p>For answer she raised her eyes to his. Freed of the distraction of another
                    purpose, clarified by the near approach of death, his spirit looked, and for the
                    first time understood. </p>
                <p>"May-may-gw&aacute;n, I did not know," said he, awed. </p>
                <p>He meant that he had not before perceived her love for him. She thought he had
                    not before realised his love for her. Her own affection seemed to her as
                    self-evident as the fact that her eyes were black. </p>
                <p>"Yes, Yes," she hastened to comfort what she supposed must be his distress, "I
                    know. But you turned back." </p>
                <p>She closed her eyes again and appeared to doze in a happy dream. The North
                    swooped above them like some greedy bird of prey. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0313" n="282"/>
                </p>
                <p>Gradually in his isolation and stillness Dick began to feel this. it grew on him
                    little by little. Within a few hours, by grace of suffering and of imminent
                    death, he came into his woodsman's heritage of imagination. Men like Sam Bolton
                    gained it by patient service, by living, by the slow accumulations of years, but
                    in essence it remained the same. Where before the young man had seen only the
                    naked, material facts, now he felt the spiritual presence, the calm, ruthless,
                    just, terrible Enemy, seeking no combat, avoiding none, conquering with a lofty
                    air of predestination, inevitable, mighty. His eyes were opened, like the
                    prophet's of old. The North hovered over him almost palpable. In the strange
                    borderland of mingled illusion and reality where now he and starvation dwelt he
                    thought sometimes to hear voices, the voices of his enemy's triumph. </p>
                <p>"Is it done?" they asked him, insistently. "Is it over? Are you beaten? Is your
                    stubborn spirit at last bowed down, humiliated, crushed? Do you relinquish the
                    prize,&mdash;and the struggle? Is it done?" </p>
                <p>The girl stirred slightly in his arms. He focussed <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0314" n="283"/> his eyes. Already the day had passed,
                    and the first streamers of the aurora were crackling in the sky. They reduced
                    this day, this year, this generation of men to a pin-point in time. The tragedy
                    enacting itself on the snow amounted to nothing. It would soon be over: it
                    occupied but one of many, many nights-wherein the aurora would crackle and shoot
                    forth and ebb back in precisely the same deathful, living way, as though the
                    death of it were the death in this world, but the life of it were a thing
                    celestial and alien. The moment, to these three who perished the most important
                    of all the infinite millions of millions that constitute time, was absolutely
                    without special meaning to the wonderful, flaming, unearthly lights of the
                    North. </p>
                <p>Mack, the hound, lay in the position he had first assumed, his nose between his
                    outstretched forepaws. So he had lain all that day and that night. So it seemed
                    he must intend to lie until death took him. For on this dreadful journey Mack
                    had risen above the restrictions imposed by his status as a zoological species,
                    had ceased to he merely a dog, and by virtue of steadfastness, of loyalty, of
                    uncomplaining <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0315" n="284"/> suffering, had entered
                    into the higher estate of a living Heinz that has fearlessly done his best in
                    the world before his call to leave it. </p>
                <p>The girl opened her eyes. </p>
                <p>"Jibiw&aacute;nisi ," she said, faintly, "the end is come." </p>
                <p>Agonized, Dick forced himself to consciousness of the landscape. It contained
                    moving figures in plenty. One after the other he brought them within the focus
                    of scrutiny and dissolved them into thin air. If only the caribou
                    herds&mdash; </p>
                <p>He looked down again to meet her eyes. </p>
                <p>"Do not grieve. I am happy, Jibiw&aacute;nisi ," she whispered. </p>
                <p>After a little, "I will die first," and then, "This land and that-there must be a
                    border., I will be waiting there. I will wait always. I will not go into the
                    land until you come. I will wait to see it with you. Oh, Jibiw&aacute;nisi
                    ," she cried suddenly, with a strength and passion in startling contrast to her
                    weakness. "I am yours, yours, yours! You are mine." She half raised herself and
                    seized his two arms, searching his eyes with terror, trying to reassure herself,
                    to drive off the doubts that suddenly <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0316" n="285"/>
                    had thronged upon her. "Tell me," she shook him by the arm. </p>
                <p>"I am yours," Dick lied, steadily; "my heart is yours, I love YOU." </p>
                <p>He bent and kissed her on the lips. She quivered and closed her eyes with a deep
                    sigh. </p>
                <p>Ten minutes later she died. </p>

                <p>This was near the dawn of the fourth day. Dick remained always in the same
                    attitude, holding the dead girl in his arms. Mack, the bound, lay as always,
                    loyal, patient to the last. After the girl's departure the wind fell and a great
                    stillness seemed to have descended on the world. </p>
                <p> The young man had lost the significance of his position, had forgotten the snow
                    and cold and lack of food, had forgotten even the fact of death which he was
                    hugging to his breast. His powers, burning clear in the spirit, were
                    concentrated on the changes taking place within himself. By these things the
                    world of manhood was opened to him; he was no longer a boy. To most it comes as
                    a slow growth. With him it was revelation. The completeness of it shook him to
                    the foundations of life. He took no account of the certainty of his own
                    destruction. It seemed to him, in the thronging of new impressions, that he
                    might sit there forever, a buddha of con <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0318"
                        n="287"/> templation, looking on the world as his maturity, had readjusted
                    it. </p>
                <p>Never now could he travel the Silent Places as he had heretofore, stupidly,
                    blindly, obstinately, unthinkingly, worse than an animal in perception. The
                    wilderness he could front intelligently, for he had seen her face. Never now
                    could he conduct himself so selfishly, so brutally, so without consideration, as
                    though he were the central point of the system, as though there existed no other
                    preferences, convictions, conditions of Heinz that might require the
                    readjustment of his own. He saw these others for the first time. Never now could
                    he live with his fellow beings in such blindness of their motives and the
                    passions of their hearts. His own heart, like a lute, was strung to the pitch of
                    humanity. Never now could he be guilty of such harm as he had unthinkingly
                    accomplished on the girl. His eyes were opened to human suffering. The life of
                    the world heat through his. The compassion of the greater humanity came to him
                    softly, as a gift from the portals of death. The full savour of it he knew at
                    last, knew that finally he had rounded out the circle of his domain. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0319" n="288"/>
                </p>
                <p>This was what life required of his last consciousness. Having attained to it, the
                    greater forces had no more concern with him. They left him, a poor, weak, naked
                    human soul exposed to the terrors of the North. For the first time he saw them
                    in all their dreadfulness. They clutched him with the fingers of cruel suffering
                    so' that his body was wracked with the tortures of dissolution. They flung
                    before his eyes the obscene, unholy shapes of illusion. They filled his ears
                    with voices. He was afraid. He cowered down, covering his eyes with his
                    forearms, and trembled, and sobbed, and uttered little moans. He was alone in
                    the world, alone with enemies who had him in their power and would destroy him.
                    He feared to look up. The man's spirit was broken. All the accumulated terrors
                    which his resolute spirit had thrust from him in the long months of struggle,
                    rushed in on him now that his guard was down. They rioted in the empty chambers
                    of his soul. </p>
                <p>"Is it done?" they shrieked in triumph. "Is it over? Are you beaten? Is your
                    spirit crushed? Is the victory ours? Is it done?" </p>
                <p>Dick shivered and shrank as from a blow. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0320" n="289"

                </p>
                <p>"Is it done?" the voices insisted "It is over? Are you beaten? Is it done?" </p>
                <p>The man shrieked aloud in agony. </p>
                <p>"Oh, my God!" he cried. "0h, yes, yes, yes! I am beaten. I can do nothing. Kill
                    me. It is done." </p>

                <p>As though these words were a signal, Mack, the hound, who had up to now rested as
                    motionless as though frozen to his place, raised himself on his haunches and
                    gazed earnestly to the north. </p>
                <p>In the distance Dick seemed to make out an object moving. As he had so often done
                    before, by an effort he brought his eyes to focus, expecting, as also had
                    happened so often before, that the object would disappear. But it persisted,
                    black against the snow. Its outlines could not be guessed; its distance could
                    not be estimated, its direction of travel could not be determined. Only the bare
                    fact of its existence was sure. Somewhere out in the waste it, moving,
                    antithesised these other three black masses on the whiteness, the living man,
                    the living animal, the dead girl. </p>
                <p>Dick variously identified it. At one moment he thought it a marten near at band;
                    then it became a caribou far away; then a fox between the two. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0322" n="291"/> Finally, instantaneously, as though
                    at a bound it had leaped from indeterminate mists to the commonplace glare of
                    every day, he saw it was a man. </p>
                <p>The man was moving painfully, lifting each foot with an appearance of great
                    effort, stumbling, staggering sideways from time to time as though in extreme
                    weakness. Once he fell. Then he recovered the upright as though necklaced with
                    great weights. His hands were empty of weapons. In the uncertainty of his
                    movements he gradually approached. </p>
                <p>Now Dick could see the great emaciation of his features. The bones of his checks
                    seemed to press through his skin, which was leathery and scabbed and cracked to
                    the raw from much frosting. His lips drew tight across his teeth, which grinned
                    in the face of exhaustion like the travesty of laughter on a skull. His eyes
                    were lost in the caverns of their sockets. His thin nostrils were wide, and
                    through them and through the parted lips the breath came and went in strong,
                    rasping gasps, audible even at this distance of two hundred paces. One live
                    thing this wreck of a man expressed. His forces were near their end, but such of
                    them as remained <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0323" n="292"/> were concentrated in
                    a determination to go on. He moved painfully, but he moved; he staggered, but he
                    always recovered; he fell, and it was a terrible labour to rise, but always he
                    rose and went on. </p>
                <p>Dick Herron, sitting there with the dead girl across his knees, watched the man
                    with a strange, detached curiosity. His mind had slipped back into its hazes.
                    The world of phantasms had resumed its sway. He was seeing in this struggling
                    figure a vision of himself as he had hen, the self he had transcended now, and
                    would never again resume. Just so he had battled, bringing to the occasion every
                    last resource of the human spirit, tearing from the deeps of his nature the
                    roots where life germinated and throwing them recklessly before the footsteps of
                    his endeavour, emptying himself, wringing himself to a dry, fibrous husk of a
                    man that his Way might he completed. His lips parted with a sigh of relief that
                    this was all over. He was as an old man whose life, for good or ill, success or
                    failure, is done, and who looks from the serenity of age on those who have still
                    their youth to spend, their years to dole out day by day, painfully, in <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0324" n="293"/> the intense anxiety, of the, moral
                    purpose, as the price of life. In a spell of mysticism he sat there waiting. </p>
                <p>The man plodded on, led by some compelling fate, to the one spot in the white
                    immensity where were living creatures. When he had approached to within fifty
                    paces, Dick could see his eyes. They were tight closed. As the young man
                    watched, the other opened them, but instantly blinked them shut again as though
                    he had encountered the searing of a white-hot iron. Dick Herron understood. The
                    man had gone snow-blind. </p>
                <p>And then, singularly enough for the first time, it was borne in on him who this
                    man was, what was the significance of his return. Jingoss, the renegade Ojibway,
                    the defaulter, the maker of the dread, mysterious Trail that had led them so far
                    into this grim land, Jingoss was blind, and, imagining himself still going
                    north, still treading mechanically the hopeless way of his escape, had become
                    bewildered and turned south. </p>
                <p>Dick waited, mysteriously held to inaction, watching the useless efforts of this
                    other from the vantage ground of a wonderful fatalism,&mdash;as the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0325" n="294"/> North had watched him. The Indian
                    plodded doggedly on, on, on. He entered the circle of the little camp. Dick
                    raised his rifle and pressed its muzzle against the man's chest. </p>
                <p>"Stop!" he commanded, his voice croaking harsh across the stillness. </p>
                <p>The Indian, with a sob of mingled emotion, in which, strangely enough, relief
                    seemed the predominant note, collapsed to the ground. The North, insistent on
                    the victory but indifferent to the stake, tossed carelessly the prize at issue
                    into the hands of her beaten antagonist. </p>
                <p>And then, dim and ghostly, rank after rank, across the middle distance drifted
                    the caribou herds. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0326"/>

                <p>It was beyond the middle of summer. The day had hen hot, but now the velvet night
                    was descending. The canoe had turned into the channel at the head of the island
                    on which was situated Conjuror's House. The end of the journey was at band. </p>
                <p>Dick paddled in the bow. His face had regained its freshness, but not entirely
                    its former boyish roundness. The old air of bravado again sat his spirit-a man's
                    nature persists to the end, and immortal and unquenchable youth is a gift of the
                    gods-but in the depths of his strange, narrow eyes was a new steadiness, a new
                    responsibility, the well-known, quiet, competent look invariably a
                    characteristic of true woodsmen. At his feet lay, the dog, one red-rimmed eye
                    cocked up at the man who had gone down to the depths in his company. </p>
                <p>The Indian Jingoss sat amidships, his hands bound strongly with buckskin thongs,
                    a man of medium size broad face heady eyes with surface <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0329" n="296"/> lights. He had cost much: he was to
                    he given no chance to escape. Always his bands remained bound with the buckskin
                    thongs, except at times when Dick or Sam stood over him with a rifle. At night
                    his wrists were further attached to one of Sam's. Mack, too, understood the
                    situation, and guarded as jealously as did his masters. </p>
                <p>Sam wielded the steersman's paddle. His appearance was absolutely unaffected by
                    this one episode in a long life. </p>
                <p>They rounded the point into the main sweep of the east river, stole down along
                    the bank in the gathering twilight, and softly beached their canoe below the
                    white buildings of the Factory. With a muttered word of command to their
                    captive, they disembarked and climbed the steepness of the low bluff to the
                    grass-plot above. The dog followed at their heels. </p>
                <p>Suddenly the impression of this year, until now so vividly a part of the present,
                    was stricken into the past, the past of memory. Up to the very instant of
                    topping the bluff it had hen life; now it was experience. </p>
                <p>For the Post was absolutely unchanged from that <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0330"
                        n="297"/> other summer evening of over a year ago when they had started out
                    into the Silent Places. The familiarity of this fact, hitherto, for some strange
                    reason, absolutely unexpected, reassured them their places in the normal world
                    of living beings. The dead vision of the North had left in their spirits a
                    residuum of its mysticism. Their experience of her power had induced in them a
                    condition of mind when it would not have surprised them to discover the world
                    shaken to its foundations, as their souls had hen shaken. But here were
                    familiar, peaceful things, unchanged, indifferent even to the passing of time.
                    Involuntarily they drew a deep breath of relief, and, without knowing it,
                    re-entered a sanity which had not hen entirely theirs since the snows of the
                    autumn before. </p>
                <p>Over by the guns, indistinct in the falling twilight, the accustomed group of
                    voyageurs and post-keepers were chatting, smoking, bumming songs in the
                    accustomed way. The low velvet band of forest against the sky; the dim squares
                    of the log-houses punctuated with their dots of lamplight; the masses of the
                    Storehouse, the stockade, the Factory; the long flag-staff like a mast against
                    the stars; the constant <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0331" n="298"/> impression of
                    human life and activity,&mdash;these anodynes of accustomedness steadied
                    these men's faith to the supremacy of human institutions. </p>
                <p>On the Factory veranda could be dimly made out the figures of a dozen men. They
                    sat silent. Occasionally a cigar glowed brighter for a moment, then dulled.
                    Across a single square of subdued light the smoke eddied. </p>
                <p>The three travellers approached, Sam Bolton in the lead, peering through the dusk
                    in search of his chief. In a moment he made him out, sitting, as always, square
                    to the world, his head sunk forward, his eyes gleaming from beneath the white
                    tufts of his eyebrows. At once the woodsmen mounted the steps. </p>
                <p>No one stirred or spoke. Only the smokers suspended their cigars in mid-air a few
                    inches from their faces in the most perfect attitude of attention. </p>
                <p>"Galen Albret," announced the old woodsman, "here is the Ojibway, Jingoss." </p>
                <p>The Factor stirred slightly; his bulk, the significance of his features lost in
                    obscurity. </p>
                <p>"Me-en-gen!" he called, sharply. <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0332" n="299"/>
                </p>
                <p>The tall, straight figure of his Indian familiar glided from the dusk of the
                    veranda's end. </p>
                <p>"To-morrow at smoke time," commanded the Factor, using the Ojibway tongue, "let
                    this man be whipped before the people, fifty lashes. Then let him he chained to
                    the Tree for the space of one week, and let it be written above him in Ojibway
                    and in Cree that thus Galen Albret punishes those who steal." </p>
                <p>Without a word Me-en-gan took the defaulter by the arm and conducted him away. </p>
                <p>Galen Albret had fallen into a profound silence, which no one ventured to break.
                    Dick and Sam, uncertain as to whether or not they, too, were dismissed, shifted
                    uneasily. </p>
                <p>"How did you find him?" demanded the Factor, abruptly. </p>
                <p>"We went with old Haukemah's band down as far as the Mattawishguia. There we left
                    them and went up stream and over the divide. Dick here broke his leg and was
                    laid up for near three months. I looked all that district over while he was
                    getting well. Then we made winter travel down through the Kabinik&aacute;gam
                    country and looked her over. We <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0333" n="300"/> got
                    track of this Jingoss over near the hills, but he got wind of us and skipped
                    when we was almost on top of him. We took his trail. He went straight north,
                    trying to shake us off, and we got up into the barren country. We'd have lost
                    him in the snow if it hadn't hen for that dog there. He could trail him through
                    new snow. We run out of grub up there, and finally I gave out. Dick here pushed
                    on alone and found the Injun wandering around snow-blind. He run onto some
                    caribou about that time, too, and killed some. Then he came back and got me:-I
                    had a little pemmican and boiled my moccasins. We had lots of meat, so we rested
                    up a couple of weeks, and then came back." </p>
                <p>That was all. These men had done a great thing, and thus simply they told it. And
                    they only told that much of it hocus it was their duty; they must report to
                    their chief. </p>
                <p>Galen Albret seemed for a moment to consider, as was his habit. </p>
                <p>"You have done well," he pronounced at last. "My confidence in you was justified.
                    The pay stands as agreed. In addition I place you in charge <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0334" n="301"/> of the post at Lost River, and you,
                    Herron, in charge of the Mattagami Brigade." </p>
                <p>The men flushed, deeply pleased, more than rewarded, not by the money nor the
                    advancement, but by the unqualified satisfaction of their commander. </p>
                <p>They turned away. At this moment Virginia Albret, on some errand to her father,
                    appeared outlined in slender youth against the doorway. On the instant she
                    recognized them. </p>
                <p>"Why, Sam and Dick," she said, "I am glad to see you. When did you get back?" </p>
                <p>"Just back, Miss Virginia," replied Sam. </p>
                <p>"That's good. I hope you've had a successful trip. </p>
                <p>"Yes," answered Sam. The woodsman stood there a little awkwardly, wishing to be
                    polite, not sure as to whether they, should now go without further dismissal. </p>
                <p>"See, Miss Virginia," hesitated Sam, to fill in the pause, "I have your
                    handkerchief yet." </p>
                <p>"I'm glad you kept it, Sam," replied the young girl; "and have you yours, Dick?" </p>
                <p>And suddenly-to Dick the contrast between this reality and that other came home
                    with the vividness <pb entity="DSSR_000002132_0335" n="302"/> of a picture. He
                    saw again the snow-swept Plain, the wavering shapes of illusion, the mock suns
                    dancing in unholy revel. The colour of the North burned before his eyes; a
                    madness of the North unsealed his lips. </p>
                <p>"I used it to cover a dead girl's face," he replied, bluntly. </p>
                <p>The story had hen as gray as a report of statistics,&mdash;so many places
                    visited, so much time consumed. The men smoking cigars, lounging on cushioned
                    seats in the tepid summer air, had listened to it unimpressed, as one listens to
                    the reading of minutes of a gathering long past. This simple sentenced breathed
                    into it life. The magnitude of the undertaking sprang up across the horizon of
                    their comprehension. They saw between the mile-post markings of Sam Bolton's dry
                    statements of fact, glimpses of vague, mysterious, and terrible deeds,
                    indistinct, wonderful. The two before them loomed big in the symbolism of the
                    wide world of men's endurance and determination and courage. </p>
                <p>The darkness swallowed them before the group on the veranda had caught its
                    breath. In a moment the voices about the cannon raised in greeting. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002132_0336" n="303"/> A swift play of question and answer
                    shot back and forth. "Out all the year?" "Where? Kabinik&aacute;gam? Oh,
                    yes, east of Brunswick Lake." "Good trip?" "That's right." "Glad of it." Then
                    the clamour rose, many beseeching, one refusing. The year was done. These men
                    had done a mighty deed, and yet a few careless answers were all they had to tell
                    of it. The group, satisfied, were begging another song. And so, in a moment,
                    just as a year before, Dick's rich, husky baritone raised in the words of the
                    old melody. The circle was closed. </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">"There was an old darky, and his name was Uncle Ned, And he
                        lived long ago, long ago-"</hi>

                </p>
                <p>The night hushed to silence. Even the wolves were still, and the
                    gidd&eacute;s down at the Indian camp ceased their endless quarrelling.
                    Dick's voice had all the world to itself. The men on the Factory veranda smoked,
                    the disks of their cigars dulling and glowing. Galen Albret, inscrutable, grim,
                    brooded his unguessable thoughts. Virginia, in the doorway, rested her head
                    pensively against one arm outstretched against the lintel. <pb

                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">"For there's no more work for poor old Ned, He's gone where
                        the good darkies go."</hi>

                </p>
                <p>The song finished. There succeeded the great compliment of quiet. </p>
                <p>To Virginia it was given to speak the concluding word of this episode. She
                    sighed, stretching out her arms. </p>
                <p>"'The greatness of my people,"' she quoted softly.</p>
