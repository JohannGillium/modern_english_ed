                    <lg type="verse">
                        <l>JOSEPH, a carpenter of Nazareth,</l>
                        <l> And his wife Mary had an only child,</l>
                        <l> Jesus : One holy from his mother's womb. </l>
                        <l> Both parents loved him : Mary's heart alone</l>
                        <l> Beat with his blood, and, by her love and his,</l>
                        <l> She knew that God was with her, and she strove</l>
                        <l> Meekly to do the work appointed her;</l>
                        <l> To cherish him with undivided care</l>
                        <l> Who deigned to call her mother, and who loved</l>
                        <l> From her the name of son. And Mary gave</l>
                        <l> Her heart to him, and feared not; yet she seemed</l>
                        <l> To hold as sacred that he said or did;</l>
                        <l> And, unlike other women, never spake</l>
                        <l> His words of innocence again ; but all</l>
                        <l> Were humbly treasured in her memory</l>
                        <l> With the first secret of his birth. So strong</l>
                        <l> Grew her affection, as the child increased</l>
                        <l> In wisdom and in stature with his years,</l>
                        <l> That many mothers wondered, saying : " These</l>
                        <l> Our little ones claim in our hearts a place</l>
                        <l> The next to God ; but Mary's tenderness</l>
                        <l> Grows almost into reverence for her child.</l>
                        <l> Is he not of herself ? I' the temple when</l>
                        <l> Kneeling to pray, on him she bends her eyes,</l>
                        <l> As though God only heard her prayer through him.</l>
                        <l> Is he to be a prophet ? Nay, we know</l>
                        <l> That "out of Galilee no prophet comes."</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg type="verse">
                        <l>But all their children made the boy their friend.</l>

                    <lg type="verse">
                        <l>Three cottages that overlooked the sea</l>
                        <l> Stood side by side eastward of Nazareth.</l>
                        <l> Behind them rose a sheltering range of cliffs,</l>
                        <l> Purple and yellow, verdure-spotted, red,</l>
                        <l> Layer upon layer built up against the sky. </l>

                        <l>In front a row of sloping meadows lay,</l>
                        <l> Parted by narrow streams, that rose above, </l>
                        <l> Leaped from the rocks, and cut the sands below</l>
                        <l> Into deep channels widening to the sea.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg type="verse">
                        <l>Within the humblest of these three abodes</l>
                        <l> Dwelt Joseph, his wife Mary, and their child.</l>
                        <l> A honeysuckle and a moss-rose grew,</l>
                        <l> With many blossoms, on their cottage front ;</l>
                        <l> And o'er the gable warmed by the South</l>
                        <l> A sunny grape vine broadened shady leaves</l>
                        <l> Which gave its tendrils shelter, as they hung</l>
                        <l> Trembling upon the bloom of purple fruit.</l>
                        <l> And, like the wreathed shadows and deep glows</l>
                        <l> Which the sun spreads from some old oriel</l>
                        <l> Upon the marble Altar and the gold</l>
                        <l> Of God's own Tabernacle, where he dwells</l>
                        <l> For ever, so the blossoms and the vine,</l>
                        <l> On Jesus' home climbing above the roof,</l>
                        <l> Traced intricate their windings all about</l>
                        <l> The yellow thatch, and part concealed the nests</l>
                        <l> Whence noisy close-housed sparrows peeped unseen.</l>
                        <l> And Joseph had a little dove-cote placed</l>
                        <l> Between the gable-window and the eaves,</l>
                        <l> Where two white turtle doves (a gift of love</l>
                        <l> From Mary's kinsman Zachary to her child)</l>
                        <l> Cooed pleasantly ; and broke upon the ear</l>
                        <l> The ever dying sound of falling waves.</l>
                        <l> three long weeks</l>
                        <l> With patient instinct till it broke the shell ;</l>
                        <l> And she had nursed it with all tender care,</l>
                        <l> Another three, and watched the white down grow</l>
                        <l> Into full feather, till it left her nest.</l>
                        <l> And now it stood outside its narrow home,</l>
                        <l> With tremulous wings let loose and blinking eyes ;</l>
                        <l> While, hovering near, the old dove often tried</l>
                        <l> By many lures to tempt it to the ground,</l>
                        <l> That they might feed from Jesus' hand, who stood</l>
                        <l> Watching them from below. The timid bird</l>
                        <l> At last took heart, and, stretching out its wings, </l>
                        <l>
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002623_0013" n="51"/> Brushed the light vine-leaves
                            as it fluttered down.</l>
                        <l> Just then a hawk rose from a tree, and thrice</l>
                        <l> Wheeled in the air, and poised his aim to drop</l>
                        <l> On the young dove, whose quivering plumage swelled</l>
                        <l> About the sunken talons as it died.</l>
                        <l> Then the hawk fixed his round eye on the child,</l>
                        <l> Shook from his beak the stained down, screamed, and flapped</l>
                        <l> His broad arched wings, and, darting to a cleft </l>
                        <l> I' the rocks, there sullenly devoured his prey.</l>
                        <l> And Jesus heard the mother's anguished cry,</l>
                        <l> Weak like the distant sob of some lost child,</l>
                        <l> Who in his terror runs from path to path,</l>
                        <l> Doubtful alike of all ; so did the dove,</l>
                        <l> As though death-stricken, beat about the air ;</l>
                        <l> Till, settling on the vine, she drooped her head</l>
                        <l> Deep in her ruffled feathers. She sat there,</l>
                        <l> Brooding upon her loss, and did not move</l>
                        <l> All through that day.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg type="verse">
                        <l>And the child Jesus wept,</l>
                        <l> And, sitting by her, covered up his face :</l>
                        <l> Until a cloud, alone between the earth</l>
                        <l> And sun, passed with its shadow over him.</l>
                        <l> Then Jesus for a moment looked above ;</l>
                        <l> And a few drops of rain fell on his brow, </l>
                        <l> Sad, as with broken hints of a lost dream,</l>
                        <l> Or dim foreboding of some future ill.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg type="verse">
                        <l>Now, from a garden near, a fair-haired girl</l>
                        <l> Came, carrying a handful of choice flowers,</l>
                        <l> Which in her lap she sorted orderly,</l>
                        <l> As little children do at Easter-time</l>
                        <l> To have all seemly when their Lord shall rise.</l>
                        <l> Then Jesus' covered face she gently raised,</l>
                        <l> Placed in his hand the flowers, and kissed his cheek</l>
                        <l> And tried with soothing words to comfort him ;</l>
                        <l> He from his eyes spoke thanks.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg type="verse">
                        <l>But still the tears,</l>
                        <l> Fast trickling down his face, drop upon drop,</l>
                        <l> Fell to the ground. That sad look left him not</l>
                        <l> Till night brought sleep, and sleep closed o'er his woe. </l>

                    <lg type="verse">
                        <l>Again there came a day when Mary sat</l>
                        <l> Within the latticed doorway's fretted shade,</l>
                        <l> Working in bright and many colored threads</l>
                        <l> A girdle for her child, who at her feet</l>
                        <l> Lay with his gentle face upon her lap. </l>
                        <l> Both little hands were crossed and tightly clasped</l>
                        <l> Around her knee. On them the gleams of light</l>
                        <l> Which broke through overhanging blossoms warm,</l>
                        <l> And cool transparent leaves, seemed like the gems</l>
                        <l> Which deck Our Lady's shrine when incense-smoke</l>
                        <l> Ascends before her, like them, dimly seen</l>
                        <l> Behind the stream of white and slanting rays</l>
                        <l> Which came from heaven, as a veil of light,</l>
                        <l> Across the darkened porch, and glanced upon </l>
                        <l> The threshold-stone ; and here a moth, just born</l>
                        <l> To new existence, stopped upon her flight,</l>
                        <l> To bask her blue-eyed scarlet wings spread out</l>
                        <l> Broad to the sun on Jesus' naked foot,</l>
                        <l> Advancing its warm glow to where the grass,</l>
                        <l> Trimmed neatly, grew around the cottage door.</l>

                        <l> With her, or, lost in thought, would seem to watch</l>

                        <l> Their hum, to press with honey-searching trunk</l>

                        <l> The child sat by himself upon the beach,</l>
                        <l> While Joseph's barge freighted with heavy wood,</l>

                        <l> Three children, and then two, with each an arm</l>

                        <l> But, when they saw his thoughtful face, they ceased,</l>
                        <l> And, looking at each other, drew near him ;</l>

                        <l> Put these both from him, saying, " Here is one</l>

                        <l> To be our king ;" and then he placed the wreath</l>
                        <l> On Jesus' brow, who meekly bowed his head.</l>
                        <l> And, when he took the reed, the children knelt,</l>
                        <l> And cast their simple offerings at his feet :</l>

                        <l> Kissed him with reverence, promising to yield</l>
                        <l> Grave fealty. And Jesus did return</l>
                        <l> Their childish salutations ; and they passed</l>
                        <l> Singing another song, whose music chimed</l>
                        <l> With the sea's murmur, like a low sweet chant</l>
                        <l> Chanted in some wide church to Jesus Christ. </l>

                        <l>Joseph had one ewe-sheep ; and she brought forth,</l>

                        <l> Grew thoughtful, and she said : " I had, last night,</l>

                        <l> We sometimes see in visions of the night,</l>
                        <l> Barren and dimly lighted. There was not </l>

                        <l> A shrivelled thistle grew : the grass was dead, </l>
                        <l> And the starved soil glared through its scanty tufts</l>
                        <l> In bare and chalky patches, cracked and hot,</l>
                        <l> Chafing my tired feet, that caught upon</l>

                        <l>To close my eyes, and shut it out from sight.</l>

                        <l> Only increased the dread ; and so I gazed</l>
                        <l> With open eyes into my dream again.</l>
                        <l> The mists had thickened, and had grown quite black</l>

                        <l> (Thy father said it thundered towards the morn.)</l>
                        <l> But soon, far off, I saw a dull green light</l>
                        <l> Break though the clouds, which fell across the earth,</l>
                        <l> Like death upon a bad man's upturned face.</l>
                        <l> Sudden it burst with fifty forked darts</l>
                        <l> In one white flash, so dazzling bright it seemed</l>
                        <l> To hide the landscape in one blaze of light.</l>
                        <l> When the loud crash that came down with it had</l>

                        <l> The calm dark silence came a plaintive sound ;</l>
                        <l> And, looking towards the tree, I saw that it</l>
                        <l> Was scorched with the lightning ; and there stood</l>
                        <l> Close to its foot a solitary sheep</l>
                        <l> Bleating upon the edge of a deep pit,</l>

                        <l> And into this a little snow white lamb,</l>
                        <l> Like to thine own, had fallen. It was dead</l>
                        <l> And cold, and must have lain there very long ;</l>
                        <l> While, all the time, the mother had stood by,</l>
                        <l> Helpless, and moaning with a piteous bleat.</l>
                        <l> The lamb had struggled much to free itself,</l>
                        <l> For many cruel thorns had torn its head</l>
                        <l> And bleeding feet ; and one had pierced its side,</l>
                        <l> From which flowed blood and water. Strange the things</l>

                        <l> I thought it changed into the quiet face</l>
                        <l> Of my own child. Then I awoke, and saw</l>

            <div1 id="d15" type="section">
                <head>The Purpose and Tendency of Early Italian Art.</head>
                <p>The object we have proposed to ourselves in writing on Art, has been " an
                    endeavour to encourage and enforce an entire adherence to the simplicity of
                    nature ; and also to direct attention, as an auxiliary medium, to the
                    comparatively few works which Art has yet produced in this spirit." It is in
                    accordance with the former and more prominent of these objects that the writer
                    proposes at present to treat.</p>
                <p>An unprejudiced spectator of the recent progress and main direction of Art in
                    England will have observed, as a great change in the character of the
                    productions of the modern school, a marked attempt to lead the taste of the
                    public into a new channel by producing pure transcripts and faithful studies
                    from nature, instead of conventionalities and feeble reminiscences from the Old
                    Masters; an entire seeking after originality in a more humble manner than has
                    been practised since the decline of Italian Art in the Middle Ages. This has
                    been most strongly shown by the landscape painters, among whom there are many
                    who have raised an entirely new school of natural painting, and whose
                    productions undoubtedly surpass all others in the simple attention to nature in
                    detail as well as in generalities. By this they have succeeded in earning for
                    themselves the reputation of being the finest landscape painters in Europe. But,
                    although this success has been great and merited, it is not of them that we have
                    at present to treat, but rather to recommend their example to their
                    fellow-labourers, the historical painters.</p>
                <p>That the system of study to which this would necessarily lead requires a somewhat
                    longer and more devoted course of observation than any other is undoubted ; but
                    that it has a reward in a greater effect produced, and more delight in the
                    searching, is, the writer thinks, equally certain. We shall find a greater
                    pleasure in proportion to our closer communion with nature, and by a more exact
                    adherence to all her details, (for nature has no peculiarities or
                    excentricities) in whatsoever direction her study may conduct.</p>
                <p>This patient devotedness appears to be a conviction peculiar to, or at least more
                    purely followed by, the early Italian Painters ; a feeling which, exaggerated,
                    and its object mistaken by them, though still held holy and pure, was the cause
                    of the retirement of many of the greatest men from the world to the monastery ;
                    there, in undisturbed silence and humility,</p>



                <pb entity="DSSR_000002623_0021" n="59"/>



                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>" Monotonous to paint</l>
                    <l>Those endless cloisters and eternal aisles</l>
                    <l>With the same series, Virgin, Babe, and Saint,</l>
                    <l>With the same cold, calm, beautiful regard."</l>
                </lg>
                <p>Even with this there is not associated a melancholy feeling alone ; for, although
                    the object was mistaken, yet there is evinced a consciousness of purpose
                    definite and most elevated ; and again, we must remember, as a great cause of
                    this effect, that the Arts were, for the most part, cleric, and not laic, or at
                    least were under the predominant influence of the clergy, who were the most
                    important patrons by far, and their houses the safest receptacles for the works
                    of the great painter.</p>
                <p>The modern artist does not retire to monasteries, or practise discipline ; but he
                    may show his participation in the same high feeling by a firm attachment to
                    truth in every point of representation, which is the most just method. For how
                    can good be sought by evil means, or by falsehood, or by slight in any degree ?
                    By a determination to represent the thing and the whole of the thing, by
                    training himself to the deepest observation of its fact and detail, enabling
                    himself to reproduce, as far as possible, nature herself, the painter will best
                    evince his share of faith.</p>
                <p>It is by this attachment to truth in its most severe form that the followers of
                    the Arts have to show that they share in the peculiar character of the present
                    age,&mdash;a humility of knowledge, a diffidence of attainment ; for, as
                    Emerson has well observed,</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>" The time is infected with Hamlet's unhappiness,&mdash;</l>
                    <l> 'Sicklied o'er with the the pale cast of thought.'</l>
                </lg>
                <p>Is this so bad then ? Sight is the last thing to be pitied. Would we be blind ?
                    Do we fear lest we should outsee nature and God, and drink truth dry ?"</p>
                <p>It has been said that there is presumption in this movement of the modern school,
                    a want of deference to established authorities, a removing of ancient landmarks.
                    This is best answered by the profession that nothing can be more humble than the
                    pretension to the observation of facts alone, and the truthful rendering of
                    them. If we are not to depart from established principles, how are we to advance
                    at all ? Are we to remain still ? Remember, no thing remains still ; that which
                    does not advance falls backward. That this movement is an advance, and that it
                    is of nature herself, is shown by its going nearer to truth in every object
                    produced, and by its being guided by the very principles the ancient painters
                    followed, as soon as they attained the mere power of representing an object
                    faithfully. <pb entity="DSSR_000002623_0022" n="60"/> These principles are now
                    revived, not from them, though through their example, but from nature herself.</p>
                <p>That the earlier painters came nearer to fact, that they were less of the art,
                    artificial, cannot be better shown than by the statement of a few examples from
                    their works. There is a magnificent Niello work by an unknown Florentine artist,
                    on which is a group of the Saviour in the lap of the Virgin. She is old, (a most
                    touching point) ; lamenting aloud, clutches passionately the heavy-weighted body
                    on her knee ; her mouth is open. Altogether it is one of the most powerful
                    appeals possible to be conceived ; for there are few but will consider this
                    identification with humanity to be of more effect than any refined or emasculate
                    treatment of the same subject by later artists, in which we have the fact
                    forgotten for the sake of the type of religion, which the Virgin was always
                    taken to represent, whence she is shown as still young ; as if, nature being
                    taken typically, it were not better to adhere to the emblem throughout,
                    confident by this means to maintain its appropriateness, and, therefore, its
                    value and force.</p>
                <p>In the Niello work here mentioned there is a delineation of the Fall, in which
                    the serpent has given to it a human head with a most sweet, crafty expression.
                    Now in these two instances the style is somewhat rude ; but there are passion
                    and feeling in it. This is not a question of mere execution, but of mind,
                    however developed. Let us not mistake, however, from this that execution should
                    be neglected, but only maintained as a most important aid, and in that quality
                    alone, so that we do not forget the soul for the hand. The power of representing
                    an object, that its entire intention may be visible, its lesson felt, is all
                    that is absolutely necessary : mere technicalities of performance are but
                    additions ; and not the real intent and end of painting, as many have considered
                    them to be. For as the knowledge is stronger and more pure in Masaccio than in
                    the Caracci, and the faith higher and greater,&mdash;so the first represents
                    nature with more true feeling and love, with a deeper insight into her
                    tenderness ; he follows her more humbly, and has produced to us more of her
                    simplicity ; we feel his appeal to be more earnest : it is the crying out of the
                    man, with none of the strut of the actor.</p>
                <p>Let us have the mind and the mind's-workings, not the remains of earnest thought
                    which has been frittered away by a long dreary course of preparatory study, by
                    which all life has been evaporated. Never forget that there is in the wide river
                    of nature something which every body who has a rod and line may catch, precious
                    things which every one may dive for.</p>
                <p>It need not be feared that this course of education would lead to a <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002623_0023" n="61"/> repetition of the toe-trippings of the
                    earliest Italian school, a sneer which is manifestly unfair ; for this error, as
                    well as several others of a similar kind, was not the result of blindness or
                    stupidity, but of the simple ignorance of what had not been applied to the
                    service of painting at their time. It cannot be shown that they were incorrect
                    in expression, false in drawing, or unnatural in what is called composition. On
                    the contrary, it is demonstrable that they exceeded all others in these
                    particulars, that they partook less of coarseness and of conventional sentiment
                    than any school which succeeded them, and that they looked more to nature ; in
                    fact, were more true, and less artificial. That their subjects were generally of
                    a melancholy cast is acknowledged, which was an accident resulting from the
                    positions their pictures were destined to occupy. No man ever complained that
                    the Scriptures were morbid in their tendency because they treat of serious and
                    earnest subjects : then why of the pictures which represent such ? A certain
                    gaunt length and slenderness have also been commented upon most severely ; as if
                    the Italians of the fourteenth century were as so many dray horses, and the
                    artist were blamed for not following his model. The consequence of this
                    direction of taste is that we have life-guardsmen and pugilists taken as models
                    for kings, gentlemen, and philosophers. The writer was once in a studio where a
                    man, six feet two inches in height, with atlantean shoulders, was sitting for
                    King Alfred. That there is no greater absurdity than this will be perceived by
                    any one that has ever read the description of the person of the king given by
                    his historian and friend Asser.</p>
                <p>The sciences have become almost exact within the present century. Geology and
                    chemistry are almost re-instituted. The first has been nearly created ; the
                    second expanded so widely that it now searches and measures the creation. And
                    how has this been done but by bringing greater knowledge to bear upon a wider
                    range of experiment ; by being precise in the search after truth ? If this
                    adherence to fact, to experiment and not theory,&mdash;to begin at the
                    beginning and not fly to the end,&mdash;has added so much to the knowledge
                    of man in science ; why may it not greatly assist the moral purposes of the Arts
                    ? It cannot be well to degrade a lesson by falsehood. Truth in every particular
                    ought to be the aim of the artist. Admit no untruth : let the priest's garment
                    be clean.</p>
                <p>Let us now return to the Early Italian Painters. A complete refutation of any
                    charge that the character of their school was neccessarily gloomy will be found
                    in the works of Benozzo Gozzoli, as in his ' Vineyard ' where there are some
                    grape-gatherers the most elegant and graceful imaginable ; this painter's
                    children are the <pb entity="DSSR_000002623_0024" n="72"/> most natural ever
                    painted. In Ghiberti,&mdash;in Fra Angilico, (well named),&mdash;in
                    Masaccio,&mdash;in Ghirlandajo, and in Baccio della Porta, in fact in nearly
                    all the works of the painters of this school, will be found a character of
                    gentleness, grace, and freedom, which cannot be surpassed by any other school,
                    be that which it may ; and it is evident that this result must have been
                    obtained by their peculiar attachment to simple nature alone, their casting
                    aside all ornament, or rather their perfect ignorance of such,&mdash;a happy
                    fortune none have shared with them. To show that with all these qualifications
                    they have been pre-eminent in energy and dignity, let us instance the ' Air
                    Demons ' of Oreagna, where there is a woman borne through the air by an Evil
                    Spirit. Her expression is the most terrible imaginable ; she grasps her bearer
                    with desperation, looking out around her into space, agonized with terror. There
                    are other figures in the same picture of men who have been cast down, and are
                    falling through the air : one descends with his hands tied, his chin up, and
                    long hair hanging from his head in a mass. One of the Evil Spirits hovering over
                    them has flat wings, as though they were made of plank : this gives a most
                    powerful character to the figure. Altogether, this picture contains perhaps a
                    greater amount of bold imagination and originality of conception than any of the
                    kind ever painted. For sublimity there are few works which equal the '
                    Archangels ' of Giotto, who stand singly, holding their sceptres, and with
                    relapsed wings. The ' Paul ' of Masaccio is a well-known example of the
                    dignified simplicity of which these artists possessed so large a share. These
                    instances might be multiplied without end ; but surely enough have been cited in
                    the way of example to show the surpassing talent and knowledge of these
                    painters, and their consequent success, by following natural principles, until
                    the introduction of false and meretricious ornament led the Arts from the simple
                    chastity of nature, which it is as useless to attempt to elevate as to endeavour
                    to match the works of God by those of man. Let the artist be content to study
                    nature alone, and not dream of elevating any of her works, which are alone
                    worthy of representation.<ref n="1" target="purp1">*</ref></p>
                <p>The Arts have always been most important moral guides. Their <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002623_0025" n="63"/> flourishing has always been coincident
                    with the most wholesome period of a nation's : never with the full and gaudy
                    bloom which but hides corruption, but the severe health of its most active and
                    vigorous life ; its mature youth, and not the floridity of age, which, like the
                    wide full open petals of a flower, indicates that its glory is about to pass
                    away. There has certainly always been a period like the short warm season the
                    Canadians call the " Indian Summer," which is said to be produced by the burning
                    of the western forests, causing a factitious revival of the dying year : so
                    there always seems to have been a flush of life before the final death of the
                    Arts in each period :&mdash;in Greece, in the sculptors and architects of
                    the time after Pericles ; in the Germans, with the successors of Albert Durer.
                    In fact, in every school there has been a spring, a summer, an autumn, an "
                    Indian Summer," and then winter ; for as surely as the " Indian Summer," (which
                    is, after all, but an unhealthy flush produced by destruction,) so surely does
                    winter come. In the Arts, the winter has been exaggerated action,
                    conventionalism, gaudy colour, false sentiment, voluptuousness, and poverty of
                    invention : and, of all these characters, that which has been the most
                    infallible herald of decease, voluptuousness, has been the most rapid and sure.
                    Corruption lieth under it ; and every school, and indeed every individual, that
                    has pandered to this, and departed from the true spirit in which all study
                    should be conducted, sought to degrade and sensualize, instead of chasten and
                    render pure, the humanity it was instructed to elevate. So has that school, and
                    so have those individuals, lost their own power and descended from their high
                    seat, fallen from the priest to the mere parasite, from the law-giver to the
                    mere courtier.</p>
                <p>If we have entered upon a new age, a new cycle of man, of which there are many
                    signs, let us have it unstained by this vice of sensuality of mind. The English
                    school has lately lost a great deal of this character ; why should we not be
                    altogether free from it ? Nothing can degrade a man or a nation more than this
                    meanness ; why should we not avoid it ? Sensuality is a meanness repugnant to
                    youth, and disgusting in age : a degradation at all times. Let us say</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>" My strength is as the strength of ten,</l>
                    <l>Because my heart is pure."</l>
                </lg>
                <p> Bearing this in mind,&mdash;the conviction that, without the pure heart,
                    nothing can be done worthy of us ; by this, that the most successful school of
                    painters has produced upon us the intention of their earnestness at this
                    distance of time,&mdash;let us follow in their path, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002623_0026" n="64"/> guided by their light : not so
                    subservient as to lose our own freedom, but in the confidence of equal power and
                    equal destiny ; and then rely that we shall obtain the same success and equal or
                    greater power, such as is given to the age in which we live. This is the only
                    course that is worthy of the influence which might be exerted by means of the
                    Arts upon the character of the people : therefore let it be the only one for us
                    to follow if we hope to share in the work.</p>
                <p>That the real power of the Arts, in conjunction with Poetry, upon the actions of
                    any age is, or might be, predominant above all others will be readily allowed by
                    all that have given any thought to the subject : and that there is no assignable
                    limit to the good that may be wrought by their influence is another point on
                    which there can be small doubt. Let us then endeavour to call up and exert this
                    power in the worthiest manner, not forgetting that we chose a difficult path in
                    which there are many snares, and holding in mind the motto, " No Cross, no
                    Crown."</p>
                <p>Believe that there is that in the fact of truth, though it be only in the
                    character of a single leaf earnestly studied, which may do its share in the
                    great labor of the world : remember that it is by truth alone that the Arts can
                    ever hold the position for which they were intended, as the most powerful
                    instruments, the most gentle guides ; that, of all classes, there is none to
                    whom the celebrated words of Lessing, " That the destinies of a nation depend
                    upon its young men between nineteen and twenty-five years of age," can apply so
                    well as to yourselves. Recollect, that your portion in this is most important :
                    that your share is with the poet's share ; that, in every careless thought or
                    neglected doubt, you shelve your duty, and forsake your trust ; fulfil and
                    maintain these, whether in the hope of personal fame and fortune, or from a
                    sense of power used to its intentions ; and you may hold out both hands to the
                    world. Trust it, and it will have faith in you ; will hearken to the precepts
                    you may have permission to impart.</p>

                <head>On the Mechanism of a Historical Picture.<lb/> Part I. The Design.</head>

                <p>In tracing these memoranda of the course to be pursued in producing a work of the
                    class commonly denominated " Historic Art," we have no wish to set ourselves in
                    opposition to the practice of other artists. We are quite willing to believe
                    that there may be various methods of working out the same idea, each productive
                    of a satisfactory result. Should anyone therefore regard it as a subject for
                    controversy, we would only reply that, if different, or to them better, methods
                    be adopted by other painters, no less certain is it that there are numbers who
                    at the onset of their career have not the least knowledge of any one of these
                    methods ; and that it is chiefly for such that these notes have been penned. In
                    short, that to all about to paint their first picture we address ourselves.</p>
                <p>The first advice that should be given, on painting a historical picture, ought
                    undoubtedly to be on the choosing of a fit subject ; but, the object of the
                    present paper being purely practical, it would ill commence with a question
                    which would entail a dissertation bearing upon the most abstract properties of
                    Art. Should it afterwards appear necessary, we may append such a paper to the
                    last number of these articles ; but, for the present, we will content ourselves
                    with beginning where the student may first encounter a difficulty in giving body
                    to his idea.</p>
                <p>The first care of the painter, after having selected his subject, should be to
                    make himself thoroughly acquainted with the character of the times, and habits
                    of the people, which he is about to represent ; and next, to consult the proper
                    authorities for his costume, and such objects as may fill his canvass ; as the
                    architecture, furniture, vegetation or landscape, or accessories, necessary to
                    the elucidation of the subject. By not pursuing this course, the artist is in
                    danger of imagining an effect, or disposition of lines, incompatible with the
                    costume of his figures, or objects surrounding them ; and it will be found
                    always a most difficult thing to efface an idea that has once taken possession
                    of the mind. Besides which, it is impossible to conceive a design with any
                    truth, not being acquainted with the character, habits, and appearance, of the
                    people represented.</p>
                <p>Having, by such means, secured the materials of which his work must be composed,
                    the artist must endeavour, as far as lies in his power, to embody the picture in
                    his thoughts, before having recourse to paper. He must patiently consider his
                    subject, revolving in his <pb entity="DSSR_000002623_0033" n="71"/> mind every
                    means that may assist the clear development of the story : giving the most
                    prominent places to the most important actors, and carefully rejecting incidents
                    that cannot be expressed by pantomimic art without the aid of text. He must
                    also, in this mental forerunner of his picture, arrange the " grouping" of his
                    figures,&mdash;that is, the disposing of them in such agreeable clusters or
                    situations on his canvass as may be compatible with the dramatic truth of the
                    whole, (technically called the lines of a composition.) He must also consider
                    the color, and disposition of light and dark masses in his design, so as to call
                    attention to the principal objects, (technically called the " effect.") Thus, to
                    recapitulate, the painter, in his first conception of his picture, will have to
                    combine three qualities, each subordinate to the other ;&mdash;the
                    intellectual, or clear development, dramatic truth, and sentiment, of his
                    incident ;&mdash;the construction, or disposition of his groups and lines,
                    as most conducive to clearness, effect, and harmony ;&mdash;and the
                    chromatic, or arrangement of colors, light and shade, most suitable to impress
                    and attract the beholder.<ref n="2" target="mech1">*</ref></p>
                <p>Having settled these points in his mind, as definitely as his faculties will
                    allow of, the student will take pencil and paper, and sketch roughly each
                    separate figure in his composition, studying his own acting, (in a
                    looking-glass) or else that of any friend he may have of an artistic or poetic
                    temperament, but not employing for the purpose the ordinary paid
                    models.&mdash;It will be always found that they are stiff and feelingless,
                    and, as such, tend to curb the vivacity of a first conception, so much so that
                    the artist may believe an action impossible, through the want of comprehension
                    of the model, which to himself or a friend might prove easy.</p>
                <p>Here let the artist spare neither time nor labor, but exert himself beyond his
                    natural energies, seeking to enter into the character of each actor, studying
                    them one after the other, limb for limb, hand for hand, finger for finger,
                    noting each inflection of joint, or tension of sinew, searching for dramatic
                    truth internally in himself, and in all external nature, shunning affectation
                    and exaggeration, and striving after pathos, and purity of feeling, with patient
                    endeavor and utter simplicity of heart. For on this labor must depend the
                    success of his work with the public. Artists may praise his color, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002623_0034" n="72"/> drawing, or manipulation, his
                    chiaroscuro, or his lines ; but the clearness, truth, and sentiment, of his work
                    will alone affect the many.</p>
                <p>The action of each figure being now determinate, the next step will be to make a
                    sketch in oil of the whole design ; after which, living models, as like the
                    artist's conception as can be found, must be procured, to make outlines of the
                    nude of each figure, and again sketches of the same, draped in the proper
                        costume.<ref n="3" target="mech2">**</ref></p>
                <p>From these studies, the painter will prepare a second sketch, in outline, of the
                    whole, being, in fact, a small and hasty cartoon.<ref n="4" target="mech3"
                    >***</ref></p>
                <p>In this last preparation of the design, the chief care of the student will be the
                    grouping, and the correct size and place of each figure ; also the perspective
                    of the architecture and ground plan will now have to be settled ; a task
                    requiring much patient calculation, and usually proving a source of disgust to
                    the novice not endowed with much perseverance. But, above all, the quality to be
                    most studied in this outline design will be the proportion of the whole work.</p>
                <p>And with a few remarks on this quality, which might appropriately be termed "
                    constructive beauty in art," we will close this paper on " the Design," as
                    belonging more properly to the mechanical than the intellectual side of art ; as
                    being rather the slow growth of experience than the spontaneous impulse of the
                    artistic temperament. It is a feature in art rather apt to savor of
                    conventionality to such as would look on nature as the only school of art, who
                    would consider it but as the exponent of thought and feeling ; while, on the
                    other hand, we fear it likely to be studied to little effect by such as receive
                    with indiscriminate and phlegmatic avidity all that is handed down to them in
                    the shape of experience or time-sanctioned rule. But plastic art claims not
                    merely our sympathy, in its highest capacity to emit thought and sentiment ; but
                    as form, colour, light, life, and beauty ; and who shall settle the claims
                    between <pb entity="DSSR_000002623_0035" n="73"/> thought and beauty ? But art
                    has beauties of its own, which neither impair nor contradict the beauties of
                    nature ; but which are not of nature, and yet are, inasmuch as art itself is but
                    part of nature : and of such, the beauties of the nature of art, is the feeling
                    for constructive beauty. It interferes not with truth or sentiment ; it is not
                    the cause of unlikely order and improbable symmetry ; it is not bounded by line
                    or rule, nor taught by theory. It is a feeling for proportion, ever varying from
                    an infinity of conflicting causes, that balances the picture as it balances the
                    Gothic edifice ; it is a germ planted in the breast of the artist, that
                    gradually expands by cultivation.</p>
                <p>To those who would foster its development the only rule we could offer would be
                    never to leave a design, while they imagine they could alter for the better
                    (subordinate to the truth of nature) the place of a single figure or group, or
                    the direction of a line.</p>
                <p>And to such as think it beneath their care we can only say that they neglect a
                    refinement, of which every great master takes advantage to increase the
                    fascination which beauty, feeling, or passion, exercises over the multitude.</p>

                <note id="mech1" n="2">
                    <p>* Many artists, chiefly of the schools not colorists, are in the habit of
                        making their designs in outline, leaving the colors and light and shade to
                        be thought of afterwards. This plan may offer facilities ; but we doubt if
                        it be possible to arrange satisfactorily the colors of a work which has been
                        designed in outline without consideration of these qualities.</p>

                        study of the picture ; because, if the dresses be borrowed or hired, at this
                        period they may be only wanted for a few hours, and perhaps not required
                        again for some months to paint into the picture.&mdash;Again, if the
                        costume have to be made, and of expensive material, the portion of it seen
                        may be sufficient to pin on to a lay figure, without having the whole made,
                        which could not be worn by the living model. However, with all the larger or
                        loose draperies, it is very necessary to sketch them first from the living
                        model.</p>

                <note id="mech3" n="4">
                    <p>*** Should the picture be of small dimensions, it will be found more
                        expeditious to make an outline of it on paper the full size, which can be
                        traced on to the canvass, keeping the latter clean. On the contrary, should
                        the painting be large, the outline had better be made small, and squared to
                        transfer to the canvass.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">The Strayed Reveller ; and other Poems. By
                        A.&mdash;Fellowes, Ludgate-street.&mdash;1819.</hi>
                </p>

                <p>If any one quality may be considered common to all living poets, it is that which
                    we have heard aptly described as <hi rend="italic">self-consciousness.</hi> In
                    this many appear to see the only permanent trace of the now old usurping deluge
                    of Byronism ; but it is truly a fact of the time,&mdash;less a
                    characteristic than a portion of it. Every species of com-position&mdash;the
                    dramatic, the narrative, the lyric, the didactic, the descriptive&mdash;is
                    imbued with this spirit ; and the reader may calculate with almost equal
                    certainty on becoming acquainted with the belief of a poet as of a theologian or
                    a moralist. Of the evils resulting from the practice, the most annoying and the
                    worst is that some of the lesser poets, and all mere pretenders, in their desire
                    to emulate the really great, feel themselves under a kind of obligation to
                    assume opinions, vague, incongruous, or exaggerated, often not only not their
                    own, but the direct reverse of their own,&mdash;a kind of meanness that has
                    replaced, and goes far to compensate for, the flatteries of our literary
                    ancestors. On the other hand, this quality has created a new tie of interest
                    between the author and his public, enhances the significance of great works, and
                    confers value on even the slightest productions of a true poet.</p>
                <p>That the systematic infusion of this spirit into the drama and epic compositions
                    is incompatible with strict notions of art will scarcely be disputed : but such
                    a general objection does not apply in the case of lyric poetry, where even the
                    character of the subject is optional. It is an instance of this kind that we are
                    now about to consider.</p>
                <p>"The Strayed Reveller and other Poems," constitutes, we believe, the first
                    published poetical work of its author, although the following would rather lead
                    to the inference that he is no longer young.</p>

                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"But my youth reminds me : 'Thou</l>
                    <l>Hast lived light as these live now ;</l>
                    <l>As these are, thou too wert such.'"&mdash;p. 59.</l>
                </lg>

                <p>And, in another poem :</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"In vain, all, all, in vain,</l>
                    <l>They beat upon mine ear again,</l>
                    <l>Those melancholy tones so sweet and still :</l>
                    <l>Those lute-like tones which, in long-distant years,</l>
                    <l>Did steal into mine ears."&mdash;p. 86.</l>
                </lg>

                <p>Accordingly, we find but little passion in the volume, only four <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002623_0047" n="85"/> pieces (for "The Strayed Reveller" can
                    scarcely be so considered) being essentially connected with it. Of these the
                    "Modern Sappho" appears to us not only inferior, but as evidencing less maturity
                    both of thought and style ; the second, "Stagyrus," is an urgent appeal to God ;
                    the third, "The New Sirens," though passionate in utterance, is, in purpose, a
                    rejection of passion, as having been weighed in the balance and found wanting ;
                    and, in the last, where he tells of the voice which once</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Blew such a thrilling summons to his will,</l>
                    <l> Yet could not shake it ;</l>
                    <l> Drained all the life his full heart had to spill ;</l>
                    <l> Yet could not break it :"&mdash;</l>
                </lg>


                <p>he records the "intolerable change of thought" with which it now comes to his
                    "long-sobered heart." Perhaps "The Forsaken Merman" should be added to these ;
                    but the grief here is more nearly approaching to gloomy submission and the
                    sickness of hope deferred. The lessons that the author would learn of nature
                    are, as set forth in the sonnet that opens the volume,</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Of toil unsevered from tranquillity ;</l>
                    <l> Of labor that in one short hour outgrows</l>
                    <l> Man's noisy schemes,&mdash;accomplished in repose,</l>
                    <l> Too great for haste, too high for rivalry."&mdash;p. 1.</l>
                </lg>

                <p>His conception of the poet is of one who</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Sees before him life unroll,</l>
                    <l> A placid and continuous whole ;</l>
                    <l> That general life which does not cease ;</l>
                    <l> Whose secret is, not joy, but peace ;</l>
                    <l> That life, whose dumb wish is not missed</l>
                    <l> If birth proceeds, if things subsist ;</l>
                    <l> The life of plants and stones and rain ;</l>
                    <l> The life he craves :&mdash;if not in vain</l>
                    <l> Fate gave, what chance shall not control,</l>
                    <l> His sad lucidity of soul."&mdash;pp. 123-4. (<hi rend="italic"
                            >Resignation.</hi>)</l>
                </lg>
                <p>Such is the author's purpose in these poems. He recognises in each thing a part
                    of the whole : and the poet must know even as he sees, or breathes, as by a
                    spontaneous, half-passive exercise of a faculty : he must receive rather than
                    seek.</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>" Action and suffering tho' he know,</l>
                    <l> He hath not lived, if he lives so."</l>
                </lg>

                <p>Connected with this view of life as "a placid and continuous whole," is the
                    principle which will be found here manifested in<pb entity="DSSR_000002623_0048"
                        n="86"/> different modes, and thro' different phases of event, of the
                    permanence and changelessness of natural laws, and of the large necessity
                    wherewith they compel life and man. This is the thought which animates the
                    "Fragment of an 'Antigone :'" "The World and the Quietest" has no other scope
                    than this :&mdash;</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Critias, long since, I know,</l>
                    <l> (For fate decreed it so),</l>
                    <l> Long since the world hath set its heart to live.</l>
                    <l> Long since, with credulous zeal,</l>
                    <l> It turns life's mighty wheel :</l>
                    <l> Still doth for laborers send ;</l>
                    <l> Who still their labor give.</l>
                    <l> And still expects an end."&mdash;p. 109.</l>
                </lg>

                <p>This principle is brought a step futher into the relations of life in "The Sick
                    King in Bokhara," the following passage from which claims to be quoted, not less
                    for its vividness as description, than in illustration of this thought
                    :&mdash;</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"In vain, therefore, with wistful eyes</l>
                    <l> Gazing up hither, the poor man</l>
                    <l> Who loiters by the high-heaped booths</l>
                    <l> Below there in the Registan</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Says : 'Happy he who lodges there !</l>
                    <l> With silken raiment, store of rice,</l>
                    <l> And, for this drought, all kinds of fruits,</l>
                    <l> Grape-syrup, squares of colored ice,</l>

                    <l> The law is planted, to abide."&mdash;pp. 47-8.</l>
                </lg>

                <p>The author applies this basis of fixity in nature generally to the rules of man's
                    nature, and avow himself a Quietist. Yet he would not despond, but contents
                    himself, and waits. In no poem of the volume is this character more clearly
                    defined and developed than in the sonnets "To a Republican Friend," the first of
                    which expresses <pb entity="DSSR_000002623_0049" n="87"/> concurrence in certain
                    broad progressive principles of humanity : to the second we would call the
                    reader's attention, as to an example of the author's more firm and serious
                    writing :&mdash;</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Yet when I muse on what life is, I seem</l>
                    <l> Rather to patience prompted than that proud</l>
                    <l> Prospect of hope which France proclaims so loud ;</l>
                    <l> France, famed in all great arts, in none supreme :&mdash;</l>
                    <l> Seeing this vale, this earth whereon we dream,</l>
                    <l> Is on all sides o'ershadowed by the high</l>
                    <l> Uno'erleaped mountains of necessity,</l>
                    <l> Sparing us narrower margin than we deem.</l>
                    <l> Nor will that day dawn at a human nod,</l>
                    <l> When, bursting thro' the net-work superposed</l>
                    <l> By selfish occupation&mdash;plot and plan,</l>
                    <l> Lust, avarice, envy,&mdash;liberated man,</l>
                    <l> All difference with his fellow-man composed,</l>
                    <l> Shall be left standing face to face with God."&mdash;p. 57.</l>
                </lg>
                <p>In the adjuration entitled "Stagyrus," already mentioned, he prays to be set free</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"From doubt, where all is double,</l>
                    <l> Where Faiths are built on dust ;"</l>
                </lg>
                <p>and there seems continually recurring to him a haunting presage of the
                    unprofitableness of the life, after which men have not "any more a portion for
                    ever in anything that is done under the sun." Where he speaks of resignation,
                    after showing how the less impetuous and self-concentred natures can acquiesce
                    in the order of this life, even were it to bring them back with an end
                    unattained to the place whence they set forth ; after showing how it is the
                    poet's office to live rather than to act in and thro' the whole life round about
                    him, he concludes thus :</p>

                    recognizing his brotherhood with this world which stirs at his feet unknown,
                    confess that he too but seems.</p>
                <p>Thus far for the scheme and the creed of the author. Concerning these we leave
                    the reader to draw his own conclusions.</p>
                <p>Before proceeding to a more minute notice of the various poems, we would observe
                    that a predilection is apparent throughout for antiquity and classical
                    association ; not that strong love which made Shelley, as it were, the heir of
                    Plato ; not that vital grasp of conception which enabled Keats without, and
                    enables Landor with, the most intimate knowledge of form and detail, to return
                    to and renew <pb entity="DSSR_000002623_0051" n="89"/> the old thoughts and
                    beliefs of Greece; still less the mere superficial acquaintance with names and
                    hackneyed attributes which was once poetry. Of this conventionalism, however, we
                    have detected two instances ; the first, an allusion to "shy Dian's horn" in
                    "breathless glades" of the days we live, peculiarly inappropriate in a sonnet
                    addressed "To George Cruikshank on his Picture of 'The Bottle ;'" the second a
                    grave call to Memory to bring her tablets, occurring in, and forming the burden
                    of, a poem strictly personal, and written for a particular occasion. But the
                    author's partiality is shown, exclusively of such poems as "Mycerinus" and "The
                    Strayed Reveller," where the subjects are taken from antiquity, rather in the
                    framing than in the ground work, as in the titles "A Modern Sappho," "The New
                    Sirens," "Stagyrus," and <hi rend="italic">"In utrumque paratus."</hi> It is
                    Homer and Epictetus and Sophocles who "prop his mind ;" the immortal air which
                    the poet breathes is</p>
                <lg type="verse">

                <p>and he addresses "Fausta" and "Critias."</p>
                <p>There are four narrative poems in the volume :&mdash;"Mycerinus," "The
                    Strayed Reveller," "The Sick King in Bokhara," and "The Forsaken Merman." The
                    first of these, the only one altogether narrative in form, founded on a passage
                    in the 2nd Book of Herodotus, is the story of the six years of life portioned to
                    a King of Egypt succeeding a father "who had loved injustice, and lived long ;"
                    and tells how he who had "loved the good" revels out his "six drops of time." He
                    takes leave of his people with bitter words, and goes out</p>
                <lg type="verse">

                    <l> Rose-crowned ; and ever, when the sun went down,</l>
                    <l> A hundred lamps beamed in the tranquil gloom,</l>
                    <l> From tree to tree, all thro' the twinkling grove,</l>
                    <l> Revealing all the tumult of the feast,</l>
                    <l> Flushed guests, and golden goblets foamed with wine ;</l>
                    <l> While the deep-burnished foliage overhead</l>

                <p>(a daring image, verging towards a conceit, though not absolutely such, and the
                    only one of that character that has struck us in the volume.)</p>

                    <l> And, when the mirth waxed loudest, with dull sound</l>
                    <l> Sometimes from the grove's centre echoes came,</l>

                </lg>
                <p>Here a Tennysonian influence is very perceptible, more especially in the last
                    quotation ; and traces of the same will be found in "The Forsaken Merman."</p>
                <p>In this poem the story is conveyed by allusions and reminiscences whilst the
                    Merman makes his children call after her who had returned to her own earth,
                    hearing the Easter bells over the bay, and who is not yet come back for all the
                    voices calling "Margaret ! Margaret !" The piece is scarcely long enough or
                    sufficiently distinct otherwise than as a whole to allow of extract ; but we
                    can-not but express regret that a poem far from common-place either in subject
                    or treatment should conclude with such sing-song as</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>&mdash;"There dwells a loved one,</l>
                    <l>But cruel is she ;</l>
                    <l>She left lonely for ever</l>
                    <l>The kings of the sea."</l>
                </lg>
                <p>"The Strayed Reveller" is written without rhyme&mdash;(not being blank verse,
                    however,)&mdash;and not unfrequently, it must be admitted, without rhythm.
                    Witness the following lines :</p>
                <lg type="verse">

                    <l>"Down the dark valley&mdash;I saw."&mdash;</l>
                    <l> "Trembling, I entered ; beheld"&mdash;</l>
                    <l> "Thro' the islands some divine bard."&mdash;</l>
                </lg>

                <p>Nor are these by any means the only ones that might be cited in proof ; and,
                    indeed, even where there is nothing precisely contrary to rhythm, the verse
                    might, generally speaking, almost be read as prose. Seldom indeed, as it appears
                    to us, is the attempt to write without some fixed laws of metrical construction
                    attended with success ; never, perhaps, can it be considered as the most
                    appro-priate embodiment of thought. The fashion has obtained of late years ; but
                    it is a fashion, and will die out. But few persons will doubt the superiority of
                    the established blank verse, after reading the following passage, or will
                    hesitate in pronouncing that it ought to be the rule, instead of the exception,
                    in this poem :</p>

                <p>The Reveller, going to join the train of Bacchus in his temple, has strayed into
                    the house of Circe and has drunk of her cup : he believes that, while poets can
                    see and know only through participa-tion in endurance, he shares the power
                    belonging to the gods of seeing "without pain, without labour ;" and has looked
                    over the valley all day long at the Moenads and Fauns, and Bacchus, "some-times,
                    for a moment, passing through the dark stems." Apart from the inherent defects
                    of the metre, there is great beauty of pictorial description in some passages of
                    the poem, from which the following (where he is speaking of the gods) may be
                    taken as a specimen :&mdash;</p>

                <p>From "the Sick King in Bokhara," we have already quoted at some length. It is one
                    of the most considerable, and perhaps, as being the most simple and life-like,
                    the best of the narrative poems. A vizier is receiving the dues from the cloth
                    merchants, when he is summoned to the presence of the king, who is ill at ease,
                    by Hussein : "a teller of sweet tales." Arrived, Hussein is desired to relate
                    the cause of the king's sickness ; and he tells how, three days since, a certain
                    Moollah came before the king's path, calling for justice on himself, whom,
                    deemed a fool or a drunkard, the guards pricked off with their spears, while the
                    king passed on into the mosque : and how the man came on the morrow with
                    yesterday's blood-spots on him, and cried out for right. What follows is told
                    with great singleness and truth : "Thou knowest," the man says,</p>

                </lg>
                <p>The Vizier counsels the king that each man's private grief suffices him, and that
                    he should not seek increase of it in the griefs of other men. But he answers
                    him, (this passage we have before quoted,) that the king's lot and the poor
                    man's is the same, for that neither has his will ; and he takes order that the
                    dead man be buried in his own royal tomb.</p>
                <p>We know few poems the style of which is more unaffectedly without labor, and to
                    the purpose, than this. The metre, however, of the earlier part is not always
                    quite so uniform and intelligible as might be desired ; and we must protest
                    against the use, for the sake of rhyme, of <hi rend="italic">broke</hi> in lieu
                    of <hi rend="italic">broken,</hi> as also of <hi rend="italic">stole</hi> for
                        <hi rend="italic">stolen</hi> in "the New Sirens." While on the subject of
                    style, we may instance, from the "Fragment of an Antigone," the following
                    uncouth stanza, which, at the first reading, hardly appears to be correctly put
                    together :</p>


                <pb entity="DSSR_000002623_0056" n="94"/>


                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"But hush ! Hoemon, whom Antigone,</l>
                    <l>Robbing herself of life in burying,</l>
                    <l>Against Creon's laws, Polynices,</l>
                    <l>Robs of a loved bride, pale, imploring,</l>
                    <l>Waiting her passage,</l>
                    <l>Forth from the palace hitherward comes."&mdash;p. 30.</l>
                </lg>
                <p>Perhaps the most perfect and elevated in tone of all these poems is "The New
                    Sirens." The author addresses, in imagination, a company of fair women, one of
                    whose train he had been at morning ; but in the evening he has dreamed under the
                    cedar shade, and seen the same forms "on shores and sea-washed places,"</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"With blown tresses, and with beckoning hands."</l>
                </lg>
                <p>He thinks how at sunrise he had beheld those ladies playing between the vines ;
                    but now their warm locks have fallen down over their arms. He prays them to
                    speak and shame away his sadness ; but there comes only a broken gleaming from
                    their windows, which</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Reels and shivers on the ruffled gloom."</l>
                </lg>
                <p>He asks them whether they have seen the end of all this, the load of passion and
                    the emptiness of reaction, whether they dare look at life's latter days,</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"When a dreary light is wading</l>
                    <l> Thro' this waste of sunless greens,</l>
                    <l> When the flashing lights are fading</l>
                    <l> On the peerless cheek of queens,</l>
                    <l> When the mean shall no more sorrow,</l>
                    <l> And the proudest no more smile ;</l>
                    <l> While the dawning of the morrow</l>
                    <l> Widens slowly westward all the while ?"</l>
                </lg>
                <p>And he implores them to "let fall one tear, and set him free." The past was no
                    mere pretence ; it was true while it lasted ; but it is gone now, and the East
                    is white with day. Shall they meet again, only that he may ask whose blank face
                    that is ?</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Pluck, pluck cypress, oh pale maidens ;</l>
                    <l> Dusk the hall with yew."</l>
                </lg>
                <p>This poem must be read as a whole ; for not only would it be difficult to select
                    particular passages for extraction, but such extracts, if made, would fail in
                    producing any adequate impression.</p>
                <p>We have already quoted so larely from the concluding piece, "Resignation," that
                    it may here be necessary to say only that it is in the form of speech held with
                    "Fausta" in retracing, after a lapse of ten years, the same way they had once
                    trod with a joyful <pb entity="DSSR_000002623_0057" n="95"/> company. The tone
                    is calm and sustained, not without touches of familiar truth.</p>
                <p>The minor poems comprise eleven sonnets, among which, those "To the Duke of
                    Wellington, on hearing him mispraised," and on "Religious Isolation," deserve
                    mention ; and it is with pleasure we find one, in the tenor of strong
                    appreciation, written on reading the Essays of the great American, Emerson. The
                    sonnet for "Butler's Sermons" is more indistinct, and, as such, less to be
                    approved, in imagery than is usual with this poet. That "To an Independent
                    Preacher who preached that we should be in harmony with nature," seems to call
                    for some remark. The sonnet ends with these words :</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Man must begin, know this, where nature ends ;</l>
                    <l> Nature and man can never be fast friends ;</l>
                    <l> Fool, if thou canst not pass her, rest her slave."</l>
                </lg>
                <p>Now, as far as this sonnet shows of the discourse which occa-sioned it, we cannot
                    see anything so absurd in that discourse ; and where the author confutes the
                    Independent preacher by arguing that</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Nature is cruel ; man is sick of blood :</l>
                    <l> Nature is stubborn ; man would fain adore :</l>
                    <l> Nature is fickle ; man hath need of rest :"</l>
                </lg>
                <p>we cannot but think that, by attributing to nature a certain human degree of
                    qualities, which will not suffice for man, he loses sight of the point really
                    raised : for is not man's nature only a part of nature ? and, if a part,
                    necessary to the completeness of the whole ? and should not the individual,
                    avoiding a factitious life, order him-self in conformity with his own rule of
                    being ? And, indeed, the author himself would converse with the self-sufficing
                    progress of nature, with its rest in action, as distinguished from the troublous
                    vexation of man's toiling :&mdash;</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Two lessons, Nature, let me learn of thee,</l>
                    <l> Two lessons that in every wind are blown ;</l>
                    <l> Two blending duties harmonised in one,</l>
                    <l> Tho' the loud world proclaim their enmity."&mdash;p. 1.</l>
                </lg>
                <p>The short lyric poem, "To Fausta" has a Shelleian spirit and grace in it. "The
                    Hayswater Boat" seems a little <hi rend="italic">got up,</hi> and is scarcely
                    positive enough. This remark applies also, and in a stonger degree, to the
                    "Stanzas on a Gipsy Child," which, and the "Modern Sappho," previously
                    mentioned, are the pieces least to our taste in the volume. There is a something
                    about them of drawing-room sentimentality ; and they might almost, without
                    losing much save in size, be compressed into poems of the class commonly set to
                    music. It is rather the basis of thought than the writing of the "Gipsy Child,"
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002623_0058" n="96"/> which affords cause for objection
                    ; nevertheless, there is a passage in which a comparison is started between this
                    child and a "Seraph in an alien planet born,"&mdash;an idea not new, and
                    never, as we think, worth much ; for it might require some subtlety to show how
                    a planet capable of producing a Seraph should be alien from that Seraph.</p>
                <p> We may here notice a few cases of looseness, either of thought or of expression,
                    to be met with in these pages ; a point of style to be particularly looked to
                    when the occurrence or the absence of such forms one very sensible difference
                    between the first-rate and the second-rate poets of the present times.</p>
                <p>Thus, in the sonnet "Shakspear," the conclusion says,</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"All pains the immortal spirit must endure,</l>
                    <l> All weakness that impairs, all griefs that bow,</l>
                    <l> Find their sole <hi rend="italic">voice</hi> in that victorious brow ;"</l>
                </lg>
                <p>whereas a brow's voice remains to be uttered : nor, till the nature of the
                    victory gained by the brow shall have been pointed out, are we able to hazard an
                    opinion of the precise value of the epithet.</p>
                <p>In the address to George Cruikshank, we find : "Artist, whose hand with horror
                        <hi rend="italic">winged</hi> ;" where a similar question arises ; and,
                    returning to the "Gipsy Child," we are struck with the unmeaning-ness of the
                    line :</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Who massed round that slight brow these clouds of doom ?"</l>
                </lg>


                <p>Nor does the following, from the first of the sonnets, "To a Republican Friend,"
                    appear reconcileable with any ideas of appropriateness :</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>&mdash;"While before me <hi rend="italic">flow</hi></l>
                    <l> The <hi rend="italic">armies</hi> of the homeless and unfed."</l>
                </lg>
                <p>It is but right to state that the only instance of the kind we remember
                    throughout the volume have now been mentioned.</p>
                <p>To conclude. Our extracts will enable the reader to judge of this Poet's style :
                    it is clear and comprehensive, and eschews flowery adornment. No particular
                    model has been followed, though that general influence which Tennyson exercises
                    over so many writers of this generation may be traced here as elsewhere. It may
                    be said that the author has little, if anything, to unlearn. Care and consistent
                    arrangement, and the necessary subordination of the parts to the whole, are
                    evident throughout ; the reflective, which appears the more essential form of
                    his thought, does not absorb the due obser-vation or presentment of the outward
                    facts of nature ; and a well-poised and serious mind shows itself in every page.</p>

                <p>This Periodical will consist of original Poems, Stories to develope thought and
                    principle, Essays concerning Art and other subjects, and analytic Reviews of
                    current Literature&mdash;particularly of Poetry. Each number will also

                    month.</p>
                <p>An attempt will be made, both intrinsically and by review, to claim for Poetry
                    that place to which its present development in the literature of this country so

                <p>The endeavour held in view throughout the writings on Art will be to encourage

                    attention, as an auxiliary medium, to the comparatively few which Art has yet
                    produced in this spirit. It need scarcely be added that the chief object of the
                    etched designs will be to illustrate this aim practically, as far as the method
                    of execution will permit; in which purpose they will be produced with the utmost
