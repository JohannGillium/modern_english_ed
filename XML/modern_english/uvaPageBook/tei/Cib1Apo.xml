        <head>PREFACE.</head>

        <p> COLLEY CIBBER'S famous Autobiography has always been recognized as one of the most
          delightful books of its class; but, to students of theatrical history, the charm of its
          author's ingenuous frankness has been unable altogether to overweigh the inaccuracy and
          vagueness of his treatment of matters of fact. To remove this cause of complaint is the
          principal object of the present edition. But correcting errors is only one of an editor's
          duties, and by no means the most difficult. More exacting, and almost equally important,
          are the illustration of the circumstances surrounding the author, the elucidation of his
          references to current events, and the comparison of his statements and theories with those
          of judicious contemporaries. In all these particulars I have interpreted my duty in the
          widest sense, and have aimed at giving, as far as in me lies, an exhaustive commentary on
          the `' Apology." </p>
        <p> I am fortunate in being able to claim that my work contains much information which has
          never before been made public. A careful investigation <pb n="vi"
            entity="DSSR_000002909_0025"/> of the MSS. in the British Museum, and of the Records of
          the Lord Chamberlain's Office (to which my access was greatly facilitated by the kindness
          of Mr. Edward F. S. Pigott, the Licenser of Plays), has enabled me to give the exact dates
          of many transactions which were previously uncertain, and to give references to documents
          of great importance in stage history, whose very existence was before unknown. How
          important my new matter is, may be estimated by comparing the facts given in my notes
          regarding the intricate transactions of the years 1707 to 1721, with any previous history
          of the same period. Among other sources of information, I may mention the Cibber
          Collections in the Forster Library at South Kensington, to which my attention was drawn by
          the kindness of the courteous keeper, Mr. R. F. Sketchley; and I have also, of course,
          devoted much time to contemporary newspapers. </p>
        <p> In order to illustrate the "Apology," two tracts of the utmost rarity, the " Historia
          Histrionica" and Anthony Aston's " Brief Supplement" to Cibber's Lives of the Actors, are
          reprinted in this edition. The " Historia Histrionica " was written, all authorities
          agree, by James Wright, Barrister-at-Law, whose "History and Antiquities of the County of
          Rutland" is quoted by Cibber in his first chapter (vol. i. p. 8). The historical value of
          this pamphlet is very great, because it contains the only formal account in existence of
          the generation of actors who preceded Betterton, and because it gives many curious <pb
            n="vii" entity="DSSR_000002909_0026"/> and interesting particulars regarding the
          theatres and plays, as well as the actors, before and during the Civil Wars. As Cibber
          begins his account of the stage (see chap. iv.) at the Restoration, there is a peculiar
          propriety in prefacing it by Wright's work; a fact which has already been recognized, for
          the publisher of the third edition (1750) of the "Apology" appended to it " A Dialogue on
          Old Plays and Old Players," which is simply a reprint of the "Historia Histrionica" under
          another title, and without the curious preface. </p>
        <p> Following the "Historia Histrionica" will be found a copy of the Patent granted to Sir
          William Davenant, one of the most important documents in English stage history. A similar
          grant was made to Thomas Killigrew, as is noted on page 87 of this volume. </p>
        <p> These documents form a natural introduction to Cibber's History of the Stage and of his
          own career, which commences, as has been said, at the Restoration, and ends, somewhat
          abruptly, with his retirement from the regular exercise of his profession in 1733. To
          complete the record of Cibber's life, I have added a Supplementary Chapter to the
          'Apology," in which I have also noted briefly the chief incidents of theatrical history up
          to the time of his death. In this, too, I have told with some degree of minuteness the
          story of his famous quarrel with Pope; and to this chapter I have appended a list of
          Cibber's dramatic productions, and a Bibliography of works by, or relating to him. <pb
            n="viii" entity="DSSR_000002909_0027"/>
        </p>
        <p> Anthony Aston's "Brief Supplement to Colley Cibber, Esq; his Lives of the late famous
          Actors and Actresses," of which a reprint is given with this edition, is almost, if not
          quite, the rarest of theatrical books. Isaac Reed, says Genest," wrote his name in his
          copy of Aston's little book, with the date of 1796 &mdash; he says &mdash; 'this
          Pamphlet contains several circumstances concerning the Performers of the last century,
          which are no where else to be found &mdash; it seems never to have been published'
          &mdash; he adds &mdash; 'Easter Monday, 1795 &mdash; though I have now
          possessed this pamphlet 26 years, it is remarkable that I never have seen another copy of
          it.'" Of Aston himself, little is known. According to his own account he came on the stage
          about 1700, and we know that he was a noted stroller; but as to when he was born, or when
          he died, there is no information. He is supposed, and probably with justice, to be the "
          trusty Anthony, who has so often adorned both the theatres in England and Ireland,"
          mentioned in Estcourt's advertisement of his opening of the Bumper Tavern, in the
          "Spectator" of 28th and 29th December, 1711; and he was no doubt a well-known character
          among actors and theatre-goers. He would thus be well qualified for his undertaking as
          biographer of the actors of his time; and, indeed, his work bears every mark of being the
          production of a writer thoroughly well acquainted with his subject. This valuable pamphlet
          has been, until now practically a sealed book to theatrical students. <pb n="ix"
            entity="DSSR_000002909_0028"/>
        </p>
        <p> The three works which make up this edition &mdash; Cibber's " Apology," Wright's "
          Historia Histrionica," and Aston's " Brief Supplement" &mdash; are reprinted <hi
            rend="italic">verbatim et literatim</hi>; the only alterations made being the correction
          of obvious errors. Among obvious errors I include the avalanche of commas with which
          Cibber's printers overwhelmed his text. A more grotesque misuse of punctuation I do not
          know, and I have struck out a large number of these points, not only because they were
          unmeaning, but also because, to a modern reader, they were irritating in the highest
          degree. The rest of the punctuation I have not interfered with, and with the single
          exception of these commas the present edition reproduces not only the matter of the works
          reprinted, but the very manner in which they originally appeared, the use of italics and
          capitals having especially been carefully observed. </p>
        <p> The "Apology" of Cibber has gone through six editions. I have reprinted the text of the
          second, because it was certainly revised by the author, and many corrections made. But I
          have carefully compared my text with that of the first edition, and, wherever the
          correction is more than merely verbal, I have indicated the fact in a note (e.g. vol. i.
          p. 72). The only edition which has been annotated is that published in 1822, under the
          editorship of Edmund Bellchambers. Whether the Notes were written by the Editor or by
          Jacob Henry Burn, who annotated Dickens's "Grimaldi," is a point which I have raised <pb
            n="x" entity="DSSR_000002909_0029"/> in my "Bibliographical Account of English
          Theatrical Literature" (p. 373). I have been unable to obtain any authentic information on
          the subject, so give Burn's claim for what it is worth. The statement as to the latter's
          authorship was made in his own handwriting on the back of the title-page of a copy of the
          book, sold by a well-known bookseller some years ago. It was in the following terms
          &mdash; </p>

        <q> "In 1821, while residing at No. 28, Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, the elder Oxberry, who
          frequently called in as he passed, found me one day adding notes in MS. to Cibber's
          'Apology.' Taking it up, he said he should like to reprint it; he wanted something to
          employ the spare time of his hands, and proferred to buy my copy, thus annotated. I think
          it was two pounds I said he should have it for; this sum he instantly paid, and the notes
          throughout are mine, not Bellchambers's, who having seen it through the press or corrected
          the proofs whilst printing, added his name as the editor. &mdash; <bibl>J. H.
          BURN.</bibl>" </q>

        <p> Whether Burn or Bellchambers be the author, the notes, I find, are by no means
          faultlessly accurate. I have made little use of them, except that the Biographies, which
          are by far the most valuable of the annotations, are reprinted at the end of my second
          volume. Even in these, it will be seen, I have corrected many blunders. Some of the
          memoirs I have condensed slightly; and, as the Biographies of Booth, Dogget, and Wilks
          were in all essential points merely a repetition of Cibber's narrative, I have not
          reprinted them. In all cases where I have made any use of Bellchambers's edition, or have
          had <pb n="xi" entity="DSSR_000002909_0030"/> a reference suggested to me by it, I have
          carefully acknowledged my indebtedness. </p>
        <p> Among the works of contemporary writers which I have quoted, either in illustration, in
          criticism, or in contradiction of Cibber, it will be noticed that I make large drafts upon
          the anonymous pamphlet entitled "The Laureat: or, the right side of Colley Cibber, Esq;"
          (I 740). I have done this because it furnishes the keenest criticism upon Cibber's
          statements, and gives, in an undeniably clever style, the views of Cibber's enemies upon
          himself and his works. I am unable even to guess who was the author of this work, but he
          must have been a man well acquainted with theatrical matters. </p>
        <p> Another pamphlet from which I quote, "The Egotist: or, Colley upon Cibber" (1743), is
          interesting as being, I think without doubt, the work of Cibber himself, although not
          acknowledged by him. </p>
        <p> Many of the works which I quote in my notes have gone through only one edition, and my
          quotations from these are easily traced; but, for the convenience of those who may wish to
          follow up any of my references to books which have been more than once issued, I may
          mention that in the case of Davies's "Dramatic Miscellanies" I have referred throughout to
          the edition of I785; that Dr. Birkbeck Hill's magnificent edition of Boswell's "Life of
          Johnson" is that which I have quoted; and that the references to Nichols's reprint of
          Steele's " Theatre," the 'Anti-Theatre," &amp;c., are to the scarce and valuable <pb
            n="xii" entity="DSSR_000002909_0031"/> edition in 2 vols. 12mo, 1791. My quotations from
          the "Tatler" have been made from a set of the original folio numbers, which I am fortunate
          enough to possess; and I have made my extracts from the "Roscius Anglicanus" from Mr.
          Joseph Knight's beautiful facsimile edition. The index, which will be found at the end of
          the second volume, has been the object of my special attention, and I have spared no pains
          to make it clear and exhaustive. </p>

        <p> THE twenty-six portraits and eighteen chapter headings in this new edition of Colley
          Cibber's "Apology " are all newly engraved. The portraits are copperplate mezzotints,
          engraved by R. B. Parkes from the best and most authentic originals, in the selection of
          which great care has been taken. Where more than one portrait exists, the least hackneyed
          likeness has been chosen, and pains have been taken to secure those pictures which are
          likely to be esteemed as rarities. The chapter headings are etched by Adolphe Lalauze, and
          the subjects represent scenes from plays illustrating the costumes, manner, and appearance
          of the actors of Cibber's period, from contemporary authorities. </p>

        <head>THE PREFACE.</head>

        <p>
          <hi rend="italic">Much has been Writ of late</hi> pro <hi rend="italic">and</hi> con, <hi
            rend="italic">about the Stage, yet the Subject admits of more, and that which has not
            been hetherto toucht upon; not only what that is, but what it was, about which some
            People have made such a Busle. What it is we see, and I think it has been sufficiently
            display'd in Mr. Collier's Book; What it was in former Ages, and how used in this
            Kingdom, so far back as one may collect any Memorialls. is the Subject of the following
            Dialogue. Old Plays will be always read by the</hi> Curious, <hi rend="italic">if it
            were only to discover the Manners and Behaviour of several Ages ; and how they alter'd.
            For Plays are exactly like</hi> Portraits<hi rend="italic"> Drawn in the Garb and
            Fashion of the time when Painted. You see one Habit in the time of King Charles I.
            another quite different from that, both for Men and Women, in Queen </hi>Elizabeths<hi
            rend="italic"> time; another under Henry the Eighth different from both; and so backward
            all various. And in the several Fashions of Behaviour and Conversation, there is as much
            Mutability as in that of cloaths. Religion and Religious matters was once as much the
            Mode in publick Entertainments, as the Contrary has been in <pb n="xxii"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0041"/> some times since. This appears in the different Plays
            of several Ages: And to evince this, the following Sheets are an Essay or Specimen.
          </hi></p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="italic">Some may think the Subject of this Discourse trivial, and the persons
            herein mention'd not worth remembering, But besides that I could name some things
            contested of late with great heat, of as little, or less Consequence, the Reader may
            know that the Profession of Players is not so totally scandalous, nor all of them so
            reprobate, but that there has been found under that Name, a Canonized Saint in the
            primitive Church; as may be seen in the</hi> Roman Martyrology<hi rend="italic"> on the
            </hi>29th<hi rend="italic"> of</hi> March<hi rend="italic">; his name </hi>Masculas<hi
            rend="italic"> a Master of Interludes, (the Latin is </hi>Archimimus<hi rend="italic">,
            and the French translation</hi> un Maitre Comedien<hi rend="italic">) who under the
            Persecution of the Vandals in</hi> Africa<hi rend="italic">, by</hi> Geisericus<hi
            rend="italic"> the</hi> Arian<hi rend="italic"> King, having endured many and greivious
            Torments and Reproaches for the Confession of the Truth, finisht the Course of this
            glorious Combat. Saith the said</hi> Martyrology. </p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="italic">It appears from this, and some further Instances in the following
            Discourse, That there have been Players of worthy Principles as to Religion, Loyalty,
            and other Virtues ; and if the major part of them fall under a different Character, it
            is the general unhappiness of Mankind, that the</hi> Most<hi rend="italic"> are the</hi>
          Worst. </p>

        <head>A<lb/> DIALOGUE<lb/> OF<lb/> PLAYS and PLAYERS. </head>

        <p> LOVEWIT, TRUMAN. </p>

        <sp>
          <speaker>LOVEW.</speaker>
          <l>HONEST Old Cavalier! well met, 'faith I'm glad to see thee.</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>TRUM.</speaker>
          <l> Have a care what you call me. Old, is a Word of Disgrace among the Ladies; to be
            Honest is to be Poor, and Foolish, (as some think) and Cavalier is a Word as much out of
            Fashion as any of 'em.</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>LOVEW.</speaker>
          <l> The more's the pity: But what said the Fortune-Teller in <hi rend="italic"
              >Ben.Johnson's</hi> Mask of <hi rend="italic">Gypsies</hi>, to the then <hi
              rend="italic">Lord Privy Seal</hi>, <q> Honest and Old!</q><q> In those the <hi
                rend="italic">Good</hi> Part of a Fortune is told.</q>
          </l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>TRUM.</speaker>
          <l>
            <hi rend="italic">Ben. Johnson</hi>? How dare you name <hi rend="italic">Ben.
            Johnson</hi> in these times ? When we have such a crowd of Poets of a quite different
            Genius; the least of which thinks himself as well able to correct <hi rend="italic">Ben.
              Johnson</hi>, as he could a Country School Mistress that taught to Spell.</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>LOVEW.</speaker>
          <l> We have indeed, Poets of a different Genius; so are the Plays: but in my Opinion, they
              <pb n="xxiv" entity="DSSR_000002909_0043"/> are all of 'em (some few excepted) as much
            inferior to those of former Times, as the Actors now in being (generally speaking) are,
            compared to <hi rend="italic">Hart, Mohun, Burt, Lacy, Clun</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
              >Shatterel</hi>; for I can reach no farther backward.</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>TRUM.</speaker>
          <l> I can; and dare assure you, if my Fancy and Memory are not partial (for Men of my Age
            are apt to be over indulgent to the Thoughts of their youthful Days) I say the Actors
            that I have seen before the Wars, <hi rend="italic">Lowin, Tayler, Pollard</hi>, and
            some others, were almost as far beyond <hi rend="italic">Hart</hi> and his Company, as
            those were beyond these now in being.</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>LOVEW.</speaker>
          <l> I am willing to believe it, but cannot readily; because I have been told, That those
            whom I mention'd, were Bred up under the others of your Acquaintance, and follow'd their
            manner of Action, which is now lost. So far, that when the Question has been askt, Why
            these Players do not revive the <hi rend="italic">Silent Woman</hi>, and some other of
              <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>'s Plays, (once of highest esteem) they have answer'd,
            truly, Because there are none now Living who can rightly Humour those Parts; for all who
            related to the <hi rend="italic">Black-friers</hi>, (where they were Acted in
            perfection) are now Dead, and almost forgotten.</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>TRUM.</speaker>
          <l> 'Tis very true, <hi rend="italic">Hart</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Clun</hi>, were bred
            up Boys at the <hi rend="italic">Black-friers</hi>, and acted Womens Parts, <hi
              rend="italic">Hart</hi> was <hi rend="italic">Robinson'</hi>s Boy or Apprentice: He
            acted the Dutchess in the Tragedy of <hi rend="italic">the Cardinal</hi>, which was the
            first Part that gave him Reputation. <hi rend="italic">Cartwright</hi>, and <hi
              rend="italic">Wintershal</hi> belong'd to the private <pb n="xxv"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0044"/> House in <hi rend="italic">Salisbury-court, Burt</hi>
            was a Boy first under <hi rend="italic">Shank</hi> at the <hi rend="italic"
            >Black-friers</hi>, then under <hi rend="italic">Beeston</hi> at the <hi rend="italic"
              >Cockpit</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">Mohun</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Shatterel</hi>
            were in the same Condition with him, at the last Place. There <hi rend="italic"
            >Burt</hi> used to Play the principal Women's Parts, in particular <hi rend="italic"
              >Clariana</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Love's Cruelty</hi>; and at the same time <hi
              rend="italic">Mohun</hi> acted <hi rend="italic">Bellamente</hi>, which Part he
            retain'd after the Restauration.</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>LOVEW.</speaker>
          <l> That I have seen, and can well remember. I wish they had Printed in the last Age (so I
            call the times before the Rebellion) the Actors Names over against the Parts they Acted,
            as they have done since the Restauration. And thus one might have guest at the Action of
            the Men, by the Parts which we now Read in the Old Plays.</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>TRUM.</speaker>
          <l> It was not the Custome and Usage of those Days, as it hath been since. Yet some few
            Old Plays there are that have the Names set against the Parts, as, <hi rend="italic">The
              Dutchess of Malfy; the Picture; the Roman Actor; the deserving Favourite; the Wild
              Goose Chace</hi>, (at the Black-friers) <hi rend="italic">the Wedding; the Renegado;
              the fair Maid of the West; Hannibal and Scipio; King John and Matilda;</hi> (at the
            Cockpit) and <hi rend="italic">Holland's Leaguer</hi>, (at Salisbury Court).</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>LOVEW.</speaker>
          <l> These are but few indeed : But pray Sir, what Master-Parts can you remember the Old
              <hi rend="italic">Black-friers</hi> Men to Act, in <hi rend="italic">Johnson,
              Shakespear</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Fletcher's</hi> Plays.</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>TRUM.</speaker>
          <l> What I can at present recollect I'll tell you; <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi>, (who
            as I have heard, was a much <pb n="xxvi" entity="DSSR_000002909_0045"/> better Poet,
            than Player) <hi rend="italic">Burbadge, Hemmings</hi>, and others of the Older sort,
            were Dead before I knew the Town; but in my time, before the Wars, <hi rend="italic"
              >Lowin</hi> used to Act, with mighty Applause, <hi rend="italic">Falstaffe</hi>, <hi
              rend="italic">Morose, Volpone</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Mammon</hi> in the <hi
              rend="italic">Alchymist</hi>; <hi rend="italic">Melancius</hi>, in the <hi
              rend="italic">Maid's</hi> Tragedy, and at the same time <hi rend="italic">Amyntor</hi>
            was Play'd by <hi rend="italic">Stephen Hammerton</hi>, (who was at first a most noted
            and beautiful Woman Actor, but afterwards he acted with equal Grace and Applause, a
            Young Lover's Part) ; <hi rend="italic">Tayler</hi> Acted <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>
            incomparably well, <hi rend="italic">Jago, Truewit</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Silent
              Woman</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Face</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Alchymist;</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">Swanston</hi> used to Play <hi rend="italic">Othello; Pollard</hi>,
            and <hi rend="italic">Robinson</hi> were Comedians, so was <hi rend="italic">Shank</hi>
            who us'd to Act Sir <hi rend="italic">Roger</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">the Scornful
            Lady</hi>. These were of the <hi rend="italic">Blackfriers</hi>. Those of principal Note
            at the <hi rend="italic">Cockpit</hi>, were, <hi rend="italic">Perkins, Michael Bowyer,
              Sumner, William Allen</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Bird</hi>, eminent Actors, and <hi
              rend="italic">Robins</hi> a Comedian. Of the other Companies I took little notice.</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>LOVEW.</speaker>
          <l> Were there so many Companies?</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>TRUM.</speaker>
          <l> Before the Wars, there were in being all these Play-houses at the same time. The <hi
              rend="italic">Black-friers,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> on the <hi
              rend="italic">Bankside</hi>, a Winter and Summer House, belonging to the same Company,
            called the King's Servants; the <hi rend="italic">Cockpit</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
              >Phoenix</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Drury-lane</hi>, called the Queen's Servants ; the
            private House in <hi rend="italic">Salisbury-court</hi>, called the Prince's Servants;
            the Fortune near <hi rend="italic">White-cross-street</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic"
              >Red Bull</hi> at the upper end of St.<hi rend="italic">John's-street</hi>: <pb
              n="xxvii" entity="DSSR_000002909_0046"/> The two last were mostly frequented by
            Citizens, and the meaner sort of People. All these Companies got Money, and Liv'd in
            Reputation, especially those of the <hi rend="italic">Black-friers</hi>, who were Men of
            grave and sober Behaviour.</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>LOVEW.</speaker>
          <l> Which I admire at; That the Town much less than at present, could then maintain Five
            Companies, and yet now Two can hardly subsist.</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>TRUM.</speaker>
          <l> Do not wonder, but consider, That tho' the Town was then, perhaps, not much more than
            half so Populous as now, yet then the Prices were small (there being no Scenes) and
            better order kept among the Company that came; which made very good People think a Play
            an Innocent Diversion for an idle Hour or two, the Plays themselves being then, for the
            most part, more Instructive and Moral. Whereas of late, the Play-houses are so extreamly
            pestered with Vizard-masks and their Trade, (occasioning continual Quarrels and Abuses)
            that many of the more Civilized Part of the Town are uneasy in the Company, and shun the
            Theater as they would a House of Scandal. It is an Argument of the worth of the Plays
            and Actors, of the last Age, and easily inferr'd, that they were much beyond ours in
            this, to consider that they cou'd support themselves meerly from their own Merit; the
            weight of the Matter, and goodness of the Action, without Scenes and Machines: Whereas
            the present Plays with all that shew, can hardly draw an Audience, unless there be the
            additional Invitation of a <hi rend="italic">Signior Fideli</hi>, a <hi rend="italic"
              >Monsieur <pb n="xxviii" entity="DSSR_000002909_0047"/> L'abbe</hi>, or some such
            Foreign Regale exprest in the bottom of the Bill.</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>LOVEW.</speaker>
          <l> To wave this Digression, I have Read of one <hi rend="italic">Edward Allin</hi>, a Man
            so famed for excellent Action, that among <hi rend="italic">Ben.Johnson</hi>'s epigrams,
            I find one directed to him, full of Encomium, and concluding thus <q>Wear this Renown,
              'tis just that who did give<lb/> So many Poets Life, by one should Live.</q> Was he
            one of the <hi rend="italic">Black-friers</hi>?</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>TRUM.</speaker>
          <l> Never, as I have heard; (for he was Dead before my time). He was Master of a Company
            of his own, for whom he Built the <hi rend="italic">Fortune</hi> Playhouse from the
            Ground, a large, round Brick Building. This is he that grew so Rich that he purchased a
            great estate in <hi rend="italic">Surrey</hi> and elsewhere; and having no Issue, He
            built and largely endow'd <hi rend="italic">Dulwich</hi> College, in the Year 1619, for
            a Master, a Warden, Four Fellows, Twelve aged poor People, and Twelve poor Boys,
            &amp;c. A noble Charity.</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>LOVEW.</speaker>
          <l> What kind of Play houses had they before the Wars?</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>TRUM.</speaker>
          <l> The <hi rend="italic">Black-friers, Cockpit</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
              >Salisbury-court</hi>, were called Private Houses, and were very small to what we see
            now. The <hi rend="italic">Cockpit</hi> was standing since the Restauration, and <hi
              rend="italic">Rhode</hi>'s Company Acted there for some time.</l>

          <l> Most of 'em, except <hi rend="italic">Lowin, Tayler</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
            >Pollard</hi> (who were superannuated) went into the King's Army, and like good Men and
            true, Serv'd their Old Master, tho' in a different, yet more honourable, Capacity. <hi
              rend="italic">Robinson</hi> was Kill'd at the Taking of a Place, (I think <hi
              rend="italic">Basing House</hi>) by <hi rend="italic">Harrison</hi>, he that was after
            Hang'd at <hi rend="italic">Charing-cross</hi>, who refused him Quarter, and Shot him in
            the Head when he had laid down his Arms; abusing Scripture at the same time, in saying,
              <hi rend="italic">Cursed is he that doth the Work of the Lord negligently</hi>. <hi
              rend="italic">Mohun</hi> was a Captain, (and after the Wars were ended here, served in
              <hi rend="italic">Flanders</hi>, where he received Pay as a Major) <hi rend="italic"
              >Hart</hi> was a Lieutenant of Horse under Sir <hi rend="italic">Thomas Dallison</hi>,
            in <hi rend="italic">Prince Rupert's</hi> Regiment, <hi rend="italic">Burt</hi> was
            Cornet in the same Troop, and <hi rend="italic">Shatterel</hi> Quarter-master. <hi
              rend="italic">Allen</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Cockpit</hi>, was a Major, and
            Quarter Master General at <hi rend="italic">Oxford</hi>. I have not heard. of one of
            these Players of any Note that sided with the other Party, but only <hi rend="italic"
              >Swanston</hi>, and he profest himself a Presbyterian, took up the Trade of a
            Jeweller, and liv'd in <hi rend="italic">Aldermanbury</hi>, within the Territory of
            Father <hi rend="italic">Calamy</hi>. The <pb n="xxx" entity="DSSR_000002909_0049"/>
            rest either Lost, or expos'd their Lives for their King. When the Wars were over, and
            the Royalists totally Subdued, most of 'em who were left alive gather'd to London, and
            for a Subsistence endeavour'd to revive their Old Trade, privately. They made up one
            Company out of all the Scatter'd Members of Several; and in the Winter before the King's
            Murder, 1648, they ventured to Act some Plays with as much caution and privacy as cou'd
            be, at the <hi rend="italic">Cockpit</hi>. They continu'd undisturbed for three or four
            Days; but at last as they were presenting the Tragedy of the <hi rend="italic">Bloudy
              Brother</hi> (in which <hi rend="italic">Lowin</hi> Acted Aubrey, <hi rend="italic"
              >Tayler</hi> Rollo, <hi rend="italic">Pollard</hi> the Cook, <hi rend="italic"
            >Burt</hi> Latorch, and I think <hi rend="italic">Hart</hi> Otto) a Party of Foot
            Souldiers beset the House, surpriz'd'em about the midle of the Play, and carried 'em
            away in their habits, not admitting them to shift, to <hi rend="italic"
            >Hatton-house</hi>, then a Prison, where having detain'd them some time, they Plunderd
            them of their Cloths and let 'em loose again. Afterwards in <hi rend="italic"
            >Oliver</hi>'s time, they used to Act privately, three or four Miles, or more, out of
            Town, now here, now there, sometimes in Noblemens Houses, in particular <hi
              rend="italic">Holland-house</hi> at <hi rend="italic">Kensington</hi> where the
            Nobility and Gentry who met (but in no great Numbers) used to make a Sum for them, each
            giving a broad Peice, or the like. And <hi rend="italic">Alexander Goffe</hi>, the Woman
            Actor at <hi rend="italic">Black-friers</hi> (who had made himself known to Persons of
            Quality) used to be the jackal, and give notice of Time and Place. At Christmass, and
            Bartlemew-fair, they used to Bribe the Officer <pb n="xxxi" entity="DSSR_000002909_0050"
            /> who Commanded the Guard at <hi rend="italic">Whitehall</hi>, and were thereupon
            connived at to Act for a few Days, at the <hi rend="italic">Red Bull</hi>; but were
            sometimes notwithstanding Disturb'd by Soldiers. Some pickt up a little Money by
            publishing the Copies of Plays never before Printed, but kept up in Manuscript. For
            instance, in the Year 1652, <hi rend="italic">Beaumont</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
              >Fletcher's Wild Goose Chace</hi> was Printed in Folio, <hi rend="italic">for the
              Public use of all the Ingenious</hi>, (as the Title-page says) <hi rend="italic">and
              private Benefit of</hi> John Lowin <hi rend="italic">and</hi> Joseph Tayler, <hi
              rend="italic">Servants to his late Majesty</hi>; and by them Dedicated <hi
              rend="italic">To the Honour'd few Lovers of Dramatick Poesy</hi>: Wherein they
            modestly intimate their Wants. And that with sufficient Cause; for whatever they were
            before the Wars, they were, after, reduced to a necessitous Condition. <hi rend="italic"
              >Lowin</hi> in his latter Days, kept an Inn (the three Pidgions) at <hi rend="italic"
              >Brentford</hi>, where he dyed very Old, (for he was an Actor of eminent Note in the
            Reign of K.<hi rend="italic">James</hi> the first) and his Poverty was as great as his
            Age. <hi rend="italic">Tayler</hi> Dyed at Richmond and was there Buried. <hi
              rend="italic">Pollard</hi> who Lived Single, and had a Competent Estate; Retired to
            some Relations he had in the Country, and there ended his Life. <hi rend="italic"
              >Perkins</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sumner</hi> of the Cockpit, kept House together at
              <hi rend="italic">Clerkenwel</hi>, and were there Buried. These all Dyed some Years
            before the Restauration. What follow'd after, I need not tell you : You can easily

          <l> Yes, presently after the Restauration, the King's Players Acted publickly at the <hi
              rend="italic">Red Bull</hi> for some time, and then Removed to a New-built Playhouse
              <pb n="xxxii" entity="DSSR_000002909_0051"/> in <hi rend="italic">Vere-street</hi>, by
              <hi rend="italic">Claremarket</hi>. There they continued for a Year or two, and then
            removed to the <hi rend="italic">Theater Royal</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
            >Drury-lane</hi>, where they first made use of Scenes, which had been a little before
            introduced upon the publick Stage by Sir <hi rend="italic">William Davenant</hi> at the
              <hi rend="italic">Duke's Old Theater</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
            >Lincolns-Inn-fields</hi>, but afterwards very much improved, with the Addition of
            curious Machines, by Mr. <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi> at the New <hi rend="italic"
              >Theater</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Dorset-Garden</hi>, to the great Expence and
            continual Charge of the Players. This much impair'd their Profit o'er what it was
            before; for I have been inform'd, (by one of 'em) That for several Years next after the
            Restauration, every whole Sharer in Mr. <hi rend="italic">Hart</hi>'s Company, got
              1000<hi rend="italic">l. per an</hi>. About the same time that Scenes first enter'd
            upon the Stage at <hi rend="italic">London</hi>, Women were taught to Act their own
            Parts ; since when, we have seen at both Houses several excellent Actresses, justly
            famed as well for Beauty, as perfect good Action. And some Plays (in particular <hi
              rend="italic">The Parson's Wedding</hi>) have been Presented all by Women, as formerly
            all by Men. Thus it continued for about 20 Years, when Mr. <hi rend="italic">Hart</hi>
            and some of the Old Men began to grow weary, and were minded to leave off ; then the two
            Companies thought fit to Unite; but of late, you see, they have thought it no less fit
            to Divide again, though both Companies keep the same Name of his Majesty's Servants. All
            this while the Play-house Musick improved Yearly, and is now arrived to greater
            Perfection than ever I knew it. Yet for all these Advantages, the Reputation <pb
              n="xxxiii" entity="DSSR_000002909_0052"/> of the Stage, and Peoples Affection to it,
            are much Decay'd. Some were lately severe against it, and would hardly allow Stage-Plays
            fit to be longer permitted. Have you seen Mr. <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi>'s book
          ?</l>

          <l> And what think you ?</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>TRUM.</speaker>
          <l> In my mind Mr. <hi rend="italic">Collier'</hi>s Reflections are Pertinent, and True in
            the Main; the Book ingeniously Writ, and well Intended : But he has overshot himself in
            some Places; and his Respondents, perhaps, in more. My Affection inclines me not to
            Engage on either side, but rather Mediate. If there be Abuses relating to the Stage;
            (which I think is too apparent) let the Abuse be Reformed, and not the use, for that
            Reason only, Abolish'd. 'Twas an Old saying when I was a Boy, <q>Absit Abusus, non desit
              totaliter Usus.</q> I shall not run through Mr. Collier's Book; I will only touch a
            little on two or three general Notions, in which, I think he may be mistaken. What he
            urges out of the Primitive Councils, and Fathers of the Church, seems to me to be
            directed against the Heathen Plays, which were a sort of Religious Worship with them, to
            the Honour of <hi rend="italic">Ceres, Flora</hi>, or some of their false Deities; they
            had always a little Altar on their Stages, as appears plain enough from some places in
              <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi>. And Mr. <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi> himself, p.
            235, tells us out of <hi rend="italic">Livy</hi>, that Plays were brought in upon the
            Score of Religion, to pacify the Gods. No wonder <pb n="xxxiv"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0053"/> then, they forbid Christians to be present at them, for
            it was almost the same as to be present at their Sacrifices. We must also observe that
            this was in the Infancy of Christianity, when the Church was under severe, and almost
            continual Persecutions, and when all its true Members were of most strict and exemplary
            Lives, not knowing when they should be call'd to the Stake, or thrown to Wild-Beasts.
            They communicated Daily, and expected Death hourly ; their thoughts were intent upon the
            next World, they abstain'd almost wholly from all Diversions and pleasures (though
            lawfull and Innocent) in this. Afterwards when Persecution ceased, and the church
            flourisht, Christians being then freed from their former Terrors, allow'd themselves, at
            proper times, the lawfull Recreations of Conversation, and among other (no doubt) this
            of Shewes and Representations. After this time, the Censures of the Church indeed, might
            be continued, or revived, upon occasion, against Plays and Players; tho' (in my Opinion)
            it cannot be understood generally, but only against such Players who were of Vicious and
            Licencious Lives, and represented profane Subjects, inconsistant with the Morals and
            probity of Manners requisite to Christians; and frequented chiefly by such loose and
            Debaucht People, as were much more apt to Corrupt than Divert those who associated with
            them. I say, I cannot think the Canons and Censures of the Fathers can be applyed to all
            Players, quatenus Players; for if so how could Plays be continued among the Christians,
              <pb n="xxxv" entity="DSSR_000002909_0054"/> as they were, of Divine Subjects, and
            Scriptural Stories? A late French Author, speaking of the Original of the <hi
              rend="italic">Hotel de Bourgogne</hi> (a Play-house in <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>)
            says that the ancient Dukes of that Name gave it to the Brotherhood of the Passion,
            established in the Church of Trinity-Hospital in the <hi rend="italic">Rue S.
            Denis</hi>, on condition that they should represent here Interludes of Devotion: And
            adds that there have been public Shews in this Place 600 Years ago. The Spanish and
            Portuguize continue still to have, for the most part, such Ecclesiastical Stories, for
            the Subject of their Plays : And, if we may believe <hi rend="italic">Gage</hi>, they
            are Acted in their Churches in <hi rend="italic">Mexico</hi>, and the Spanish <hi
              rend="italic">West-Indies</hi>.</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>LOVEW.</speaker>
          <l> That's a great way off, <hi rend="italic">Truman</hi>; I had rather you would come

        <sp>
          <speaker>TRUM.</speaker>
          <l> So I intend. The same has been done here in <hi rend="italic">England</hi>; for
            otherwise how comes it to be prohibited in the 88<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Canon, among
            those past in Convocation, 1603. Certain it is that our ancient Plays were of Religious
            Subjects, and had for their Actors, (if not Priests) yet Men relating to the Church.</l>

          <speaker>TRUM.</speaker>
          <l> Nothing clearer. <hi rend="italic">Stow</hi> in his Survey of <hi rend="italic"
            >London</hi>, has one Chapter <hi rend="italic">of the Sports and Pastimes of old time
              used in this City</hi>; and there he tells us, That in the Year 1391 (which was 15 <hi
              rend="italic">R</hi>. 2.) a Stage-Play was play'd by the Parish-Clerks of <hi
              rend="italic">London</hi>, at the <hi rend="italic">Skinner's-well</hi> beside <pb
              n="xxxvi" entity="DSSR_000002909_0055"/>
            <hi rend="italic">Smithfield</hi>, which Play continued three Days together, the King,
            Queen, and Nobles of the Realm being present. And another was play'd in the Year 1409,
            (11 <hi rend="italic">H</hi>. 4.) which lasted eight Days, and was of Matter from the
            Creation of the World; whereat was present most part of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi
              rend="italic">England</hi>. Sir <hi rend="italic">William Dugdale</hi>, in his
            Antiquities of <hi rend="italic">Warwickshire</hi>, p. 116, speaking of the <hi
              rend="italic">Gray-friers</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Franciscans</hi>) at <hi
              rend="italic">Coventry</hi>, says, Before the suppression of the Monasteries, this
            City was very famous for the Pageants that were play'd therein upon <hi rend="italic"
              >Corpus-Christi</hi> Day; which Pageants being acted with mighty State and Reverence
            by the Friers of this House, had Theatres for the several Scenes very large and high,
            plac'd upon Wheels, and drawn to all the eminent Parts of the City, for the better
            advantage of the Spectators; and contain'd the Story of the New Testament, composed in
            old English Rhime. An ancient Manuscript of the same is now to be seen in the <hi
              rend="italic">Cottonian</hi> Library, <hi rend="italic">Sub Effig. Vespat. D.</hi> 8.
            Since the Reformation, in Queen <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth</hi>'s time, Plays were
            frequently acted by Quiristers and Singing Boys; and several of our old Comedies have
            printed in the Title Page, <hi rend="italic">Acted by the Children of</hi> Paul's, (not
            the School, but the Church) others, <hi rend="italic">By the Children of Her Majesty's
              Chappel</hi>; in particular, <hi rend="italic">Cinthias Revels</hi>, and the <hi
              rend="italic">Poetaster</hi> were play'd by them; who were at that time famous for
            good Action. Among <hi rend="italic">Ben. Johnson</hi>'s Epigrams you may find <hi
              rend="italic">An Epitaph on S.P</hi>
            <pb n="xxxvii" entity="DSSR_000002909_0056"/> (Sal Pavy) <hi rend="italic">one of the

          <l>Some of these Chappel Boys, when they grew Men, became Actors at the <hi rend="italic"

              rend="italic">John Underwood</hi>. Now I can hardly imagine that such Plays and
            Players as these, are included in the severe Censure of the Councils and Fathers; but
            such only who are truly within the Character given by <hi rend="italic">Didacus de

              sive ad instruendum sive ad placendum, a fratribus mendicantibus
            repraesentata</foreign>. It appears by the latter end of the Prologue, that these Plays
            or Interludes, were not only play'd at <hi rend="italic">Coventry</hi>, but in other
            Towns and Places upon occasion. And possibly this may be the same Play which <hi
              rend="italic">Stow</hi> tells us was play'd in the reign of King <hi rend="italic"
              >Henry</hi> IV., which lasted for Eight Days. TheBookseems by the Character and
            Language to be at least 300 Yearsold. It begins with a general Prologue, giving the
            arguments of 40 Pageants or Gesticulations (which were as so many several Acts or
            Scenes) representing all the Histories of both Testaments, from the Creation, to the
            choosing of St. <hi rend="italic">Mathias</hi> to be an Apostle. The Stories of the New
            Testament are more largely exprest, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. The Annunciation,
            Nativity, Visitation ; but more especially all Matters relating to the Passion very
            particularly, the Resurrection. <pb n="xxxix" entity="DSSR_000002909_0058"/> Ascention,
            the choice of St. <hi rend="italic">Mathias</hi>: After which is also represented the
            Assumption, and last judgment. All these things were treated of in a very homely style,
            (as we now think) infinitely below the Dignity of the Subject: But it seems the Gust of
            that Age was not so nice and delicate in these Matters; the plain and incurious judgment
            of our Ancestors, being prepared with favour, and taking every thing by the right and
            easiest Handle: For example, in the Scene relating to the Visitation: </l>

        <p> The last Scene or Pageant, which represents the Day of judgment, begins thus: </p>

        </q>

        <p> These and such like, were the Plays which in former Ages were presented publickly:
          Whether they had any settled and constant Houses for that purpose, does not appear; I
          suppose not. But it is notorious that in former times there was hardly ever any Solemn
          Reception of Princes, or Noble Persons, but Pageants (that is Stages Erected in the open
          Street) were part of the Entertainment. On which there were Speeches by one or more
          Persons, in the nature of Scenes; and be sure one of the Speakers must be some Saint of
          the same Name with the Party to whom the Honour is intended. For instance, there is an
          ancient Manuscript at <hi rend="italic">Coventry</hi>, call'd the <hi rend="italic">Old
            Leet Book</hi>, wherein is set down in a very particular manner, (fo. 168) the reception
          of Queen <hi rend="italic">Margaret</hi>, wife of <hi rend="italic">H</hi>. 6, who came to
            <hi rend="italic">Coventry</hi> (and I think, with her, her young Son, Prince <hi
            rend="italic">Edward</hi>) on the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy-Cross, 35 <pb

          <hi rend="italic">H</hi>. 6. (1456). Many Pageants and Speeches were made for her Welcome
          ; out of all which, I shall observe but two or three, in the Old English, as it is
          Recorded. </p>

            entity="DSSR_000002909_0061"/> fo. 221) an other Prince <hi rend="italic">Edward</hi>,
          Son of King <hi rend="italic">Edward</hi> the 4, came to <hi rend="italic">Coventry</hi>
          on the 28 of <hi rend="italic">April</hi>, 14 <hi rend="italic">E.</hi> 4, (1474) and was
          entertain'd with many Pageants and Speeches, among which I shall observe only two: one was
          of St. <hi rend="italic">Edward</hi> again, who was then made to speak thus, </p>

        <q> Noble Prince Edward, my Cousin and my Knight,<lb/> And very Prince of our Line com yn

        <p>The other Speech was from St. George; and thus saith the Book. </p>

        <q>&mdash;Also upon the Condite in the Croscheping was St. George armed, and a kings
          daughter kneling afore him with a Lamb, and the fader and the moder being in a Towre
          aboven beholding St. George saving their daughter from the Dragon, and the Condite renning
          wine in four places, and Minstralcy of Organ playing, and St. George hauing this Speech
          under-written. </q>

            one Example more of this sort of Action, or Representations, and that is of later time,
            and an instance of much higher Nature than any yet mentioned, it was at the marriage of

            to the Princess <hi rend="italic">Catherine</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Spain, An</hi>.
            1501. Her passage through <hi rend="italic">London</hi> was very magnificent, as I have
            read it described in an old M.S. Chronicle of that time. The Pageants and Speeches were
            many; the Persons represented St. <hi rend="italic">Catherine</hi>, St. <hi

          <l> No doubt on't: Yet you see there was a time when People were not so nicely censorious
            in these Matters, but were willing to take things in the best sence: and then this was
            thought a noble Entertainment for the greatest King in <hi rend="italic">Europe</hi>
            (such I esteem King <hi rend="italic">H</hi>. 7. at that time) and proper for that Day
            of mighty joy and Triumph. And I must farther observe out of the Lord <hi rend="italic"
              >Bacon</hi>'s History Of <hi rend="italic">H</hi>. 7. that the chief Man who had the
            care of that Days Proceedings was Bishop <hi rend="italic">Fox</hi>, a grave Councelor
            for War or Peace, and also a good Surveyor of Works, and a good Master of Cerimonies,
            and it seems he approv'd it. The said Lord <hi rend="italic">Bacon</hi> tells us
            farther, That whosoever had those Toys in compiling, they were not altogether
            Pedantical. </l>

          <speaker>TRUM.</speaker>
          <l> It may be so; but these were the Plays of those times. Afterwards in the Reign of K.
              <hi rend="italic">H</hi>. 8. both the Subject and Form of these Plays began to alter,
            and have since varied more and more. I have by me, a thing called <hi rend="italic">A
              merry Play between the Pardoner and the Frere, the Curate and Neybour Pratte</hi>.
            Printed the 5 of <hi rend="italic">April</hi> 1533, which was 24 <hi rend="italic"
            >H</hi>. 8. (a. few Years before the Dissolution of Monasteries). The design of this
            Play was to redicule Friers and Pardoners. Of which I'll give you a taste. To begin it,
            the Fryer enters with these Words, <q> Deus hic ; the holy Trynyte<lb/> Preserue all
              that now here be.<lb/>
            </q>
            <pb n="xlvi" entity="DSSR_000002909_0065"/>

              rent,<lb/> I com not hyther for meat nor for meale,<lb/> But I corn hyther for your
              Soules heale, &amp;c. </q> After a long Preamble, he addresses himself to Preach,
            when the Pardoner enters with these Words, <q> God and St. Leonarde send ye all his
              grace<lb/> As many as ben assembled in this place, &amp;c.<lb/>
            </q> And makes a long Speech, shewing his Bulls and his Reliques, in order to sell his
            Pardons for the raising some Money towards the rebuilding, <q> Of the holy Chappell of
              sweet saynt Leonarde,<lb/> Which late by fyre was destroyed and marde.<lb/>
            </q> Both these speaking together, with continual interruption, at last they fall
            together by the Ears. Here the Curate enters (for you must know the Scene lies in the
            Church) <q> Hold your hands; a vengeance on ye both two<lb/> That euer ye came hyther to
              make this ado, To polute my Chyrche, &amp;c.<lb/>

              <lb/> Well, ye shall synge another songe. </q> Here he calls his Neighbour <hi
              rend="italic">Prat</hi> the Constable, with design to apprehend 'em, and set 'em in
            the Stocks. But the Frier and Pardoner prove sturdy, and will not be stockt, but fall
            upon the poor Parson and Constable, and bang 'em both so well-favour'dly, that at last
            they are glad to let'em go at liberty: And so the Farce ends with a drawn Battail. Such
            as this were the Plays of that Age, acted in Gentlemens Halls at Christmas, or such like
            festival times, by the Servants of the Family, or Strowlers who went about and made it a
            Trade. It is not unlikely that<ref target="n1.1" n="1">[*]</ref> Lords in those days,
            and Persons of eminent Quality, had their several Gangs of Players, as some have now of
            Fidlers, to whom they give Cloaks and Badges. The first Comedy that I have seen that
            looks like regular, is <hi rend="italic">Gammer Gurton's Needle</hi>, writ I think in
            the reign of King <hi rend="italic">Edward</hi> 6. This is composed of five Acts, the

          <l> I observe, <hi rend="italic">Truman</hi>, from what you have said, that Plays in <hi
              rend="italic">England</hi> had a beginning much like those of <hi rend="italic"
            >Greece</hi>, the Monologues and the Pageants drawn from place to place on Wheels,
            answer exactly to the Cart of <hi rend="italic">Thespis</hi>, and the Improvements have
            been by such little steps and degrees as among the Ancients, till at last, to use the
            Words of Sir <hi rend="italic">George Buck</hi> (in his <hi rend="italic">Third
              University of</hi> England) <hi rend="italic">Dramatick Poesy is so lively exprest and
              represented upon the publick Stages and Theatres of this City, as Rome in the</hi>
              Auge<hi rend="italic"> (the highest pitch) of her Pomp and Glory, never saw it better
              perform'd, I mean </hi>(says he)<hi rend="italic"> in respect of the Action and Art,
              and not of the Cost and Sumptiousness</hi>. This he writ about the Year 1631. But can
            you inform me <hi rend="italic">Truman</hi>, when publick Theaters were first erected
            for this purpose in <hi rend="italic">London</hi>? </l>
        </sp>

        <sp>

          <l> Not certainly; but I presume about the beginning of Queen <hi rend="italic"
            >Elizabeths</hi> Reign. For <hi rend="italic">Stow</hi> in his Survey of <hi
              rend="italic">London</hi> (which Book was first printed in the Year 1598) says, <hi
              rend="italic">Of late Years, in place of these Stage-plays</hi> (i. e. those of
            Religious Matters) <hi rend="italic">have been used Comedies, Tragedies, Interludes, and
              Histories, both true and feigned; for the acting whereof certain publick Places, as
              the Theatre, the Curtine, &amp;c. have been erected</hi>. And the continuator of
              <hi rend="italic">Stows</hi> Annals, p. 1004, says, That in Sixty Years <pb n="xlix"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0068"/> before the publication of that Book, (which was <hi
              rend="italic">An. Dom.</hi> 1629) no less than 17 publick Stages, or common
            Playhouses, had been built in and about <hi rend="italic">London</hi>. In which number
            he reckons five Inns or Common Osteries, to have been in his time turned into
            Play-houses, one Cock-pit, St. <hi rend="italic">Paul's</hi> singing School, one in the
              <hi rend="italic">Blackfriers</hi>, one in the <hi rend="italic">Whitefriers</hi>, and
            one in former time at <hi rend="italic">Newington</hi> Buts; and adds, before the space
            of 6o years past, I never knew, heard, or read, of any such Theaters, set Stages, or
            Playhouses, as have been purposely built within Man's Memory. </l>
        </sp>

        <sp>

          <l> After all, I have been told, that Stage-Plays are inconsistant with the Laws of this
            Kingdom, and Players made Rogues by Statute.</l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>TRUM.</speaker>
          <l> He that told you so strain'd a point of Truth. I never met with any Law wholly to
            suppress them: Sometimes indeed they have been prohibited for a Season; as in times of
              <hi rend="italic">Lent</hi>, general Mourning or publick Calamities, or upon other
            occasions, when the Government saw fit. Thus by Proclamation, 7 of <hi rend="italic"
              >April</hi>, in the first Year of Queen <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth</hi>, Plays and
            Interludes were forbid till <hi rend="italic">All hallow-tide</hi> next following. <hi
              rend="italic">Hollinshed</hi>, p. 1184. Some Statutes have been made for their
            Regulation or Reformation, not general suppression. By the Stat. 39 <hi rend="italic"
              >Eliz.</hi> c. 4, (which was made <hi rend="italic">for the suppressing of Rogues,
              Vagabonds and sturdy Beggars</hi>) it is enacted, <q> S. 2, That all persons that be,
              or utter themselves to be, Proctors, Procurers, Patent gatherers, or Collectors for
              Gaols, </q>
            <pb n="l" entity="DSSR_000002909_0069"/>
            <q> Prisons or Hospitals, or Fencers, Barewards, common players of Interludes and
              Ministrels, wandering abroad, (other than Players of Interludes belonging to any Baron
              of this Realm, or any other honourable Personage of greater Degree, to be authoriz'd
              to play under the Hand and Seal of Arms of such Baron or Personage) All Juglers,
              Tinkers, Pedlers, and Petty chapmen, wandering abroad, all wandring Persons,
              &amp;c. able in Body, using loytering, and refusing to work for such reasonable
              Wages as is commonly given, &amp;c. These shall be ajudged and deemed Rogues,
              Vagabonds and sturdy Beggars, and punished as such. </q>
          </l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>LOVEW.</speaker>
          <l> But this priviledge of Authorizing or Licensing, is taken away by the Stat. 1 <hi
              rend="italic">Ja</hi>. 1. ch. 7, S. 1, and therefore all of them (as Mr. <hi
              rend="italic">Collier</hi> says, p. 242) are expresly brought under the foresaid
            Penalty, without distinction. </l>
        </sp>

        <sp>
          <speaker>TRUM.</speaker>
          <l> If he means all Players, without distinction, 'tis a great Mistake. For the force of
            the Queens Statute extends only to <hi rend="italic">wandring Players</hi>, and not to
            such as are the King or Queen's Servants, and establisht in settled Houses by Royal
            Authority. On such, the ill Character of vagrant Players (or as they are now called,
            Strolers) can cast no more aspersion, than the wandring Proctors, in the same Statute
            mentioned, on those of <hi rend="italic">Doctors-Commons</hi>. By a Stat. made 3 <hi
              rend="italic">Ja</hi>. 1. ch. 21. It was enacted, <q>That if any person shall in any
              Stage-play, Enterlude, Shew, Maygame, or Pageant, jestingly or prophanely speak or use
              the holy name of God, Christ Jesus, the holy Ghost, or of the Trinity, he shall
              forfeit for every such offence, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. </q> The Stat. 1 <hi
              rend="italic">Char.</hi> 1. ch. 1, enacts, <q> That no Meetings, Assemblies, or
              concourse of People shall be </q>
            <pb n="li" entity="DSSR_000002909_0070"/>
            <q>out of their own Parishes, on the Lords day, for any Sports or Pastimes whatsoever,
              nor any Bear-bating, Bull-bating, Enterludes, Common Plays, or other unlawful
              Exercises and Pastimes used by any person or persons within their own Parishes. </q>
            These are all the Statutes that I can think of relating to the Stage and Players; but
            nothing to suppress them totally, till the two Ordinances of the Long Parliament, one of
            the 22 of <hi rend="italic">October</hi> 1647, the other of the II of Feb. 1647. By
            which all Stage-Plays and Interludes are absolutely forbid; the Stages, Seats,
            Galleries, &amp;c. to be pulled down; all Players tho' calling themselves the King
            or Queens Servants, if convicted of acting within two Months before such Conviction, to
            be punished as Rogues according to Law; the Money received by them to go to the Poor of
            the Parish; and every Spectator to Pay Ss. to the use of the Poor. Also Cock-fighting
            was prohibited by one of <hi rend="italic">Oliver</hi>'s Acts Of 31 <hi rend="italic"
              >Mar</hi>. 1654. But I suppose no body pretends these things to be Laws; I could say
            more on this Subject, but I must break off here, and leave you, <hi rend="italic"

        <p> And that it shall and may be lawful to and for the said Sir William D'avenant, his heirs

        <p> And the better to preserve amity and correspondence betwixt the said companies, and that

        <p> And forasmuch as many plays, formerly acted, do contain several prophane, obscene, and
          scurrilous passages; and the womens parts therein have been acted by men in the habits of

          play shall be acted by either of the said companies, containing any passages offensive to
          piety and good manners, nor any old or revived play, containing any such offensive

          from all such offensive and scandalous passages, as aforesaid. And we do likewise permit
          and give leave that all the womens parts to be acted in either of the said two companies
          for the time to come, may be performed by women, so long as these recreations, which, by
          reason of the abuses aforesaid, were scandalous and offensive, may by such reformation <pb

          useful and instructive representations of humane life, to such of our good subjects as
          shall resort to see the same. </p>
        <p> And these our letters patents, or the inrolment thereof, shall be in all things good and
          effectual in the law, according to the true intent and meaning of the same<ref

        <head> TO A<lb/> CERTAIN GENTLEMAN.<ref target="n1.2" n="12">[1]</ref>
        </head>

        <opener>SIR,</opener>

        <p> BECAUSE I know it would give you less Concern to find your Name in an impertinent Satyr,
          than before the daintiest Dedication of a modern Author, I conceal it. </p>
        <p>Let me talk never so idly to you, this way; you are, at least, under no necessity of
          taking it to yourself: Nor when I boast, of your favours, need you blush to have bestow'd
          them. Or I may now give you <pb n="lxvi" entity="DSSR_000002909_0085"/> all the Attributes
          that raise a wise and good-natur'd Man to Esteem and Happiness, and not be censured as a
          Flatterer by my own or your Enemies. </p>
        <p>&mdash; I place my own first; because as they are the greater Number, I am afraid of
          not paying the greater Respect to them. Yours, if such there are, I imagine are too
          well-bred to declare themselves: But as there is no Hazard or visible Terror in an Attack
          upon my defenceless Station, my Censurers have generally been Persons of an intrepid
          Sincerity. Having therefore shut the Door against them while I am thus privately
          addressing you, 1 have little to apprehend from either of them. </p>
        <p>Under this Shelter, then, I may safely tell you, That the greatest Encouragement I have
          had to publish this Work, has risen from the several Hours of Patience you have lent me at
          the Reading it. It is true, I took the Advantage of your Leisure in the Country, where
          moderate Matters serve for Amusement ; and there, indeed, how far your Good-nature for an
          old Acquaintance, or your Reluctance to put the Vanity of an Author out of countenance,
          may have carried you, I cannot be sure; and yet Appearances give me stronger Hopes: For
          was not the Complaisance of a whole Evening's Attention as much as an Author of more
          Importance ought to have expected ? Why then was I desired the next Day to give you a
          second Lecture? Or why was I kept a third Day with you, to tell you more of the same Story
          ? If these Circumstances have made <pb n="lxvii" entity="DSSR_000002909_0086"/> me vain,
          shall I say, Sir, you are accountable for them ? No, Sir, I will rather so far flatter
          myself as to suppose it possible, That your having been a Lover of the Stage (and one of
          those few good judges who know the Use and Value of it, under a right Regulation) might
          incline you to think so copious an Account of it a less tedious Amusement, than it may
          naturally be to others of different good Sense, who may have less Concern or Taste for it.
          But be all this as it may; the Brat is now born, and rather than see it starve upon the
          Bare Parish Pro-vision, I chuse thus clandestinely to drop it at your Door, that it may
          exercise One of your Many Virtues, your Charity, in supporting it. </p>
        <p>If the World were to know into whose Hands I have thrown it, their Regard to its Patron
          might incline them to treat it as one of his Family : But in the Consciousness of what I
          am, I chuse not, Sir, to say who you <hi rend="italic">are</hi>. If your Equal in Rank
          were to do publick justice to your Character, then, indeed, the Concealment of your Name
          might be an unnecessary Diffidence: But am I, Sir, of Consequence enough, in any Guise, to
          do Honour to Mr. &mdash;? Were I to set him in the most laudable Lights that Truth and
          good Sense could give him, or his own Likeness would require, my officious Mite would be
          lost in that general Esteem and Regard which People of the first Consequence, even of
          different Parties, have a Pleasure in paying him. Encomiums to Superiors from Authors of
          lower Life, as <pb n="lxviii" entity="DSSR_000002909_0087"/> they are naturally liable to
          Suspicion, can add very little Lustre to what before was visible to the publick Eye : Such
          Offerings (to use the Stile they are generally dressed in) like <hi rend="italic"
          >Pagan</hi> Incense, evaporate on the Altar, and rather gratify the Priest than the Deity. </p>
        <p>But you, Sir, are to be approached in Terms within the Reach of common Sense: The honest
          Oblation of a chearful Heart is as much as you desire or I am able to bring you: A Heart
          that has just Sense enough to mix Respect with Intimacy, and is never more delighted than
          when your rural Hours of Leisure admit me, with all my laughing Spirits, to be my idle
          self, and in the whole Day's Possession of you ! Then, indeed, I have Reason to be vain; I
          am, then, distinguish'd by a Pleasure too great to be conceal'd, and could almost pity the
          Man of graver Merit that dares not receive it with the same unguarded Transport! This
          Nakedness of Temper the World may place in what Rank of Folly or Weakness they please; but
          'till Wisdom can give me something that will make me more heartily happy, I am content to
          be gaz'd at as I am, without lessening my Respect for those whose Passions may be more
          soberly covered. </p>
        <p>Yet, Sir, will I not deceive you; 'tis not the Lustre of your publick Merit, the
          Affluence of your Fortune, your high Figure in Life, nor those honourable Distinctions,
          which you had rather deserve than be told of, that have so many Years made my plain <pb
            n="lxix" entity="DSSR_000002909_0088"/> Heart hang after you: These are but incidental
          Ornaments, that, 'tis true, may be of Service to you in the World's Opinion; and though,
          as one among the Crowd, I may rejoice that Providence has so deservedly bestow'd them; yet
          my particular Attachment has risen from a meer natural and more engaging Charm, The
          Agreeable Companion! Nor is my Vanity half so much gratified in the Honour, as my Sense is
          in the Delight of your Society! When I see you lay aside the Advantages of Superiority,
          and by your own Chearfulness of Spirits call out all that Nature has given me to meet them
          then 'tis I taste you! then Life runs high! I desire possess you ! </p>
        <p>Yet, Sir, in this distinguish'd Happiness I give not up my farther Share of that
          Pleasure, or of that Right I have to look upon you with the publick Eye, and to join in
          the general Regard so unanimously pay'd to that uncommon Virtue, your <hi rend="italic"
            >Integrity</hi>! This, Sir, the World allows so conspicuous a Part of your Character,
          that, however invidious the Merit, neither the rude License of Detraction, nor the
          Prejudice of Party, has ever once thrown on it the least Impeachment or Reproach. This is
          that commanding Power that, in publick Speaking, makes you heard with such Attention! This
          it is that discourages and keeps silent the Insinuations of Prejudice and Suspicion; and
          almost renders your Eloquence an unnecessary Aid to your Assertions: Even your Opponents,
          conscious of your Integrity, <pb n="lxx" entity="DSSR_000002909_0089"/> hear you rather as
          a Witness than an Orator-But this, Sir, is drawing you too near the Light, <hi
            rend="italic">Integrity</hi> is too particular a Virtue to be cover'd with a general
          Application. Let me therefore only talk to you, as at <hi rend="italic">Tusculum</hi> (for
          so I will call that sweet Retreat, which your own Hands have rais'd) where like the fam'd
          Orator of old, when publick Cares permit, you pass so many rational, unbending Hours:
          There! and at such Times, to have been admitted, still plays in my Memory more like a
          fictitious than a real Enjoyment! H ow many golden Evenings, in that Theatrical Paradise
          of water'd Lawns and hanging Groves, have I walk'd and prated down the Sun in social
          Happiness! Whether the Retreat of <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi>, in Cost, Magnificence, or
          curious Luxury of Antiquities, might not out-blaze the <hi rend="italic">simplex
          Munditiis</hi>, the modest Ornaments of your <hi rend="italic">Villa</hi>, is not within
          my reading to determine: But that the united Power of Nature, Art, or Elegance of Taste,
          could have thrown so many varied Objects into a more delightful Harmony, is beyond my
          Conception. </p>
        <p>When I consider you in this View, and as the Gentleman of Eminence surrounded with the
          general Benevolence of Mankind; I rejoice, Sir, for you and for myself; to see <hi
            rend="italic">You</hi> in this particular Light of Merit, and myself sometimes admitted
          to my more than equal Share of you. </p>
        <p>If this <hi rend="italic">Apology</hi> for my past Life discourages you not from holding
          me in your usual Favour, let me <pb n="lxxi" entity="DSSR_000002909_0090"/> quit this
          greater Stage, the World, whenever I may, I shall think This the best-acted Part of any I
          have undertaken, since you first condescended to laugh with, </p>

        <p> SIR,<lb/> Your most obedient,<lb/> most obli'ged, and<lb/> most humble Servant,<lb/>
          COLLEY CIBBER.<lb/> Novemb. 6. 1739<lb/>

          <p>The Right Honourable Henry Pelham. Davies ("Life of Garrick," ii. 377) says that the
            "Apology" was dedicated to "that wise and honest minister," Pelham. John Taylor
            ("Records of my Life," i. 263) writes: "The name of the person to whom the Dedication to
            the 'Apology' was addressed is not mentioned, but the late Mr. John Kemble assured me
            that he had authority for saying it was Mr. Pelham, brother to the Duke of Newcastle."
            From the internal evidence it seems quite clear that this is so. In the Verses to Cibber
            quoted in "The Egotist," p. 69, the authoress writes: &mdash;</p>
          <q>"Some praise a Patron and reveal him:<lb/>You paint so true, you can't conceal
            him.<lb/>Their gaudy Praise undue but shames him,<lb/>While your's by Likeness only
            names him."</q>

          </p>

          <p>YOU know, Sir, I have often told you that one time or other I should give the Publick
            some Memoirs of my own Life; at which you have never fail'd to laugh, like a Friend,
            without saying a word to <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000002909_0093"/> dissuade me from it;
            concluding, I suppose, that such a wild Thought could not possibly require a serious
            Answer. But you see I was in earnest. And now you will say the World will find me, under
            my own Hand, a weaker Man than perhaps I may have pass'd for, even among my
            Enemies.&mdash;With all my Heart! my Enemies will then read me with Pleasure, and
            you, perhaps, with Envy, when you find that Follies, without the Reproach of Guilt upon
            them, are not inconsistent with Happiness.&mdash;But why make my Follies publick?
            Why not? I have pass'd my Time very pleasantly with them, and I don't recollect that
            they have ever been hurtful to any other Man living. Even admitting they were
            injudiciously chosen, would it not be Vanity in me to take Shame to myself for not being
            found a Wise Man? Really, Sir, my Appetites were in too much haste to be happy, to throw
            away my Time in pursuit of a Name I was sure I could never arrive at.</p>
          <p>Now the Follies I frankly confess I look upon as in some measure discharged; while
            those I conceal are still keeping the Account open between me and <pb n="3"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0094"/> my Conscience. To me the Fatigue of being upon a
            continual Guard to hide them is more than the Reputation of being without them can
            repay. If this be Weakness, <hi rend="italic">defendit numerus</hi>, I have such
            comfortable Numbers on my side, that were all Men to blush that are not Wise, I am
            afraid, in Ten, Nine Parts of the World ought to be out of Countenance: <ref
              target="n3-1" n="14">[3.1]</ref> But since that sort of Modesty is what they don't
            care to come into, why should I be afraid of being star'd at for not being particular?
            Or if the Particularity lies in owning my Weakness, will my wisest Reader be so inhuman
            as not to pardon it? But if there should be such a one, let me at least beg him to shew
            me that strange Man who is perfect! Is any one more unhappy, more ridiculous, than he
            who is always labouring to be thought so, or that is impatient when he is not thought
            so? Having brought myself to be easy under whatever the World may say of my Undertaking,
            you may still ask me why I give myself all this trouble? Is it for Fame, or Profit to
            myself, <ref target="n3-2" n="15">[3.2]</ref> or Use or Delight to others? For all these
              <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000002909_0095"/> Considerations I have neither Fondness nor
            Indifference: If I obtain none of them, the Amusement, at worst, will be a Reward that
            must constantly go along with the Labour. But behind all this there is something
            inwardly inciting, which I cannot express in few Words; I must therefore a little make
            bold with your Patience.</p>
          <p>A Man who has pass'd above Forty Years of his Life upon a Theatre, where he has never
            appear'd to be Himself, may have naturally excited the Curiosity of his Spectators to
            know what he really was when in no body's Shape but his own; and whether he, who by his
            Profession had so long been ridiculing his Benefactors, might not, when the Coat <pb
              n="5" entity="DSSR_000002909_0096"/> of his Profession was off, deserve to be laugh'd
            at himself; or from his being often seen in the most flagrant and immoral Characters,
            whether he might not see as great a Rogue when he look'd into the Glass himself as when
            he held it to others.</p>
          <p>It was doubtless form a Supposition that this sort of Curiosity wou'd compensate their
            Labours that so many hasty Writers have been encourag'd to publish the Lives of the late
            Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi>, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>, and Mr. <hi
              rend="italic">Booth</hi>, in less time after their Deaths than one could suppose it
            cost to transcribe them. <ref target="n5-1" n="16">[5.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>Now, Sir, when my Time comes, lest they shou'd think it worth while to handle my Memory
            with the same Freedom, I am willing to prevent its being so odly besmear'd (or at best
            but flatly white-wash'd) by taking upon me to give the Publick This, as true a Picture
            of myself as natural Vanity will permit me to draw: For to promise you that I shall
            never be vain, were a Promise that, like a Looking-glass too large, might break itself
            in the making: Nor am I sure I ought wholly to avoid that Imputation, because if Vanity
            be one of my natural Features, the <pb n="6" entity="DSSR_000002909_0097"/> Portrait
            wou'd not be like me without it. In a Word, I may palliate and soften as much as I
            please; but upon an honest Examination of my Heart, I am afraid the same Vanity which
            makes even homely People employ Painters to preserve a flattering Record of their
            Persons, has seduced me to print off this <hi rend="italic">Chiaro Oscuro</hi> of my
            Mind.</p>
          <p>And when I have done it, you may reasonably ask me of what Importance can the History
            of my private Life be to the Publick? To this, indeed, I can only make you a ludicrous
            Answer, which is, That the Publick very well knows my Life has not been a Private one;
            that I have been employ'd in their Service ever since many of their Grandfathers were
            young Men; And tho' I have voluntarily laid down my Post, they have a sort of Right to
            enquire into my Conduct (for which they have so well paid me) and to call for the
            Account of it during my Share of Administration in the State of the Theatre. This Work,
            therefore, which I hope they will not expect a Man of hasty Head shou'd confine to any
            regular Method: (For I shall make no scruple of leaving my History when I think a
            Digression may make it lighter for my Reader's Digestion.) This Work, I say, shall not
            only contain the various Impressions of my Mind, (as in <hi rend="italic">Louis the
              Fourteenth</hi> his Cabinet you have seen the growing Medals of his Person from
            Infancy to Old Age,) but shall likewise include with them the <hi rend="italic"
              >Theatrical History of my Own Time</hi>, from my first Appearance on the Stage to my
            last <hi rend="italic">Exit</hi>. <ref target="n6-1" n="17">[6.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <pb n="7" entity="DSSR_000002909_0098"/>

          <p>If then what I shall advance on that Head may any ways contribute to the Prosperity or
            Improvement of the Stage in Being, the Publick must of consequence have a Share in its
            Utility.</p>
          <p>This, Sir, is the best Apology I can make for being my own Biographer. Give me leave
            therefore to open the first Scene of my Life from the very Day I came into it; and tho'
            (considering my Profession) I have no reason to be asham'd of my Original; yet I am
            afraid a plain dry Account of it will scarce admit of a better Excuse than what my
            brother <hi rend="italic">Bays</hi> makes for Prince <hi rend="italic">Prettyman</hi> in
            the <hi rend="italic">Rehearsal</hi>, viz. <hi rend="italic">I only do it for fear I

            this.</p>
          <p>I was born in <hi rend="italic">London</hi>, on the <hi rend="italic">6th</hi> of<hi

          </p>


          <p>In the Year 1682, at little more than Ten Years of Age, I was sent to the Free-School
            of <hi rend="italic">Grantham</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Lincolnshire</hi>, where I staid
            till I got through it, from the lowest Form to the uppermost. And such Learning as that
            School could give me is the most I pretend to (which, tho' I have not utterly forgot, I
            cannot say I have much improv'd by Study) but even there I remember I was the same
            inconsistent Creature I have been ever since! always in full Spirits, in some small
            Capacity to do right, but in a more frequent Alacrity to do wrong; and consequently
            often under a worse Character than I wholly deserv'd: A giddy Negligence always
            possess'd me, and so much, that I remember I was once whipp'd for my <hi rend="italic"
              >Theme</hi>, tho' my Master told me, at the same <pb n="10"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0101"/> time, what was good of it was better than any Boy's in
            the Form. And (whatever Shame it may be to own it) I have observ'd the same odd Fate has
            frequently attended the course of my later Conduct in Life. The unskilful openness, or
            in plain Terms, the Indiscretion I have always acted with from my Youth, has drawn more
            ill-will towards me, than Men of worse Morals and more Wit might have met with. My
            Ignorance and want of Jealousy of Mankind has been so strong, that it is with Reluctance
            I even yet believe any Person I am acquainted with can be capable of Envy, Malice, or
            Ingratitude: <ref target="n10-1" n="24">[10.1]</ref> And to shew you what a
            Mortification it was to me, in my very boyish Days, to find myself mistaken, give me
            leave to tell you a School Story.</p>
          <p>A great Boy, near the Head taller than myself, in some wrangle at Play had insulted me;
            upon which I was fool-hardy enough to give him a Box on the Ear; the Blow was soon
            return'd with another than brought me under him and at his Mercy. Another Lad, whom I
            really lov'd and thought a good-natur'd one, cry'd out with some warmth to my Antagonist
            (while I was down) Beat him, beat him soundly! This so amaz'd me that I lost all my
            Spirits to <pb n="11" entity="DSSR_000002909_0102"/> resist, and burst into Tears! When
            the Fray was over I took my Friend aside, and ask'd him, How he came to be so earnestly
            against me? To which, with some glouting <ref target="n11-1" n="25">[11.1]</ref>
            Confusion, he reply'd, Because you are always jeering and making a Jest of me to every
            Boy in the School. Many a Mischief have I brought upon myself by the same Folly in riper
            Life. Whatever Reason I had to reproach my Companion's declaring against me, I had none
            to wonder at it while I was so often hurting him: Thus I deserv'd his Enmity by my not
            having Sense enough to know I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> hurt him; and he hated me
            because he had not Sense enough to know that I never <hi rend="italic">intended</hi> to
            hurt him.</p>
          <p>As this is the first remarkable Error of my Life I can recollect, I cannot pass it by
            without throwing out some further Reflections upon it; whether flat or spirited, new or
            common, false or true, right or wrong, they will be still my own, and consequently like
            me; I will therefore boldly go on; for I am only oblig'd to give you my <hi
              rend="italic">own</hi>, and not a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> Picture, to shew as well
            the Weakness as the Strength of my Understanding. It is not on what I write, but on my
            Reader's Curiosity I relie to be read through: At worst, tho' the Impartial may be
            tir'd, the Ill-natur'd (no small number) I know will see the bottom of me.</p>
          <p>What I observ'd then, upon my having undesignedly provok'd my School-Friend into an
            Enemy, is a common Case in Society; Errors of this kind <pb n="12"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0103"/> often sour the Blood of Acquaintance into an
            inconceivable Aversion, where it is little suspected. It is not enough to say of your
            Raillery that you intended no offence; if the Person you offer it to has either a wrong
            Head, or wants a Capacity to make that distinction, it may have the same effect as the
            Intention of the grossest Injury: And in reality, if you know his Parts are too slow to
            return it in kind, it is a vain and idle Inhumanity, and sometimes draws the Aggressor
            into difficulties not easily got out of: Or to give the Case more scope, suppose your
            Friend may have a passive Indulgence for your Mirth, if you find him silent at it; tho'
            you were as intrepid as <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi>, there can be no excuse
            for your not leaving it off. When you are conscious that your Antagonist can give as
            well as take, then indeed the smarter the Hit the more agreeable the Party: A Man of
            chearful Sense among Friends will never be grave upon an Attack of this kind, but rather
            thank you that you have given him a Right to be even with you: There are few Man (tho'
            they may be Masters of both) that on such occasions had not rather shew their Parts than
            their Courage, and the Preference is just; a Bull-Dog may have one, and only a Man can
            have the other. Thus it happens that in the coarse Merriment of common People, when the
            Jest begins to swell into earnest; for want of this Election you may observe, he that
            has least wit generally gives the first Blow. Now, as among the Better sort, a readiness
            of Wit is not always a Sign of intrinsick Merit; <pb n="13" entity="DSSR_000002909_0104"
            /> so the want of that readiness is no Reproach to a Man of plain Sense and Civility,
            who therefore (methinks) should never have these lengths of Liberty taken with him. Wit
            there becomes absurd, if not insolent; ill-natur'd I am sure it is, which Imputation a
            generous Spirit will always avoid, for the same Reason that a Man of real Honour will
            never send a Challenge to a Cripple. The inward Wounds that are given by the
            inconsiderate Insults of Wit to those that want it, are as dangerous as those given by
            Oppression to Inferiors; as long in healing, and perhaps never forgiven. There is
            besides (and little worse than this) a mutual Grossness in Raillery that sometimes is
            more painful to the Hearers that are not concern'd in it than to the Persons engaged. I
            have seen a couple of these clumsy Combatants drub one another with as little Manners of
            Mercy as if they had two Flails in their Hands; Children at Play with Case-knives could
            not give you more Apprehension of their doing one another a Mischief. And yet, when the
            Contest has been over, the Boobys have look'd round them for Approbation, and upon being
            told they were admirably well match'd, have sat down (bedawb'd as they were) contented
            at making it a drawn Battle. After all that I have said, there is no clearer way of
            giving Rules for Raillery than by Example.</p>
          <p>There are two Persons now living, who tho' very different in their manner, are, as far
            as my Judgment reaches, complete Masters of it; one of a more polite <pb n="14"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0105"/> and extensive Imagination, the other of a Knowledge
            more closely useful to the Business of Life: The one gives you perpetual Pleasure, and
            seems always to be taking it; the other seems to take none till his Business is over,
            and then gives you as much as if Pleasure were his only Business. The one enjoys his
            Fortune, the other thinks it first necessary to make it; though that he will enjoy it
            then I cannot be positive, because when a Man has once pick'd up more than he wants, he
            is apt to think it a Weakness to suppose he has enough. But as I don't remember ever to
            have seen these Gentlemen in the same Company, you must give me leave to take them
            separately. <ref target="n14-1" n="26">[14.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>The first of them, then, has a Title, and &mdash;-no matter what; I am not to speak
            of the great, but the happy part of his Character, and in this one single light; not of
            his being an illustrious, but a delightful Companion.</p>
          <p>In Conversation he is seldom silent but when he is attentive, nor ever speaks without
            exciting the Attention of others; and tho' no Man might with less Displeasure to his
            Hearers engross the Talk of the Company, he has a Patience in his Vivacity that <pb
              n="15" entity="DSSR_000002909_0106"/> chuses to divide it, and rather gives more
            Freedom than he takes; his sharpest Replies having a mixture of Politeness that few have
            the command of; his Expression is easy, short, and clear; a stiff or studied Word never
            comes from him; it is in a simplicity of Style that he gives the highest Surprize, and
            his Ideas are always adapted to the Capacity and Taste of the Person he speaks to:
            Perhaps you will understand me better if I give you a particular Instance of it. A
            Person at the University, who from being a Man of Wit easily became his Acquaintance
            there, from that Acquaintance found no difficulty in being made one of his Chaplains:
            This Person afterwards leading a Life that did no great Honour to his Cloth, obliged his
            Patron to take some gentle notice of it; but as his Patron knew the Patient was
            squeamish, he was induced to sweeten the Medicine to his Taste, and therefore with a
            smile of good humour told him, that if to the many Vices he had already, he would give
            himself the trouble to add one more, he did not doubt but his Reputation might still be
            set up again. Sir <hi rend="italic">Crape</hi>, who could have no Aversion to so
            pleasant a Dose, desiring to know what it might be, was answered, <hi rend="italic"
              >Hypocrisy, Doctor, only a little Hypocrisy!</hi> This plain Reply can need no
            Comment; but <hi rend="italic">ex pede Herculem</hi>, he is every where proportionable.
            I think I have heard him since say, the Doctor thought Hypocrisy so detestable a Sin
            that he dy'd without committing it. In a word, this Gentleman gives Spirit to Society
            the Moment he comes into it, and <pb n="16" entity="DSSR_000002909_0107"/> whenever he
            leaves it they who have Business have then leisure to go about it.</p>
          <p>Having often had the Honour to be my self the But of his Raillery, I must own I have
            received more Pleasure from his lively manner of raising the Laugh against me, than I
            could have felt from the smoothest flattery of a serious Civility. Tho' Wit flows from
            him with as much ease as common Sense from another, he is so little elated with the
            Advantage he may have over you, that whenever your good Fortune gives it against him, he
            seems more pleas'd with it on your side than his own. The only advantage he makes of his
            Superiority of Rank is, that by always waving it himself, his inferior finds he is under
            the greater Obligation not to forget it.</p>
          <p>When the Conduct of social Wit is under such Regulations, how delightful must those <hi
              rend="italic">Convivia</hi>, those Meals of Conversation be, where such a Member
            presides; who can with so much ease (as <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> phrases it)
              <hi rend="italic">set the Table in a roar</hi>. <ref target="n16-1" n="27"
            >[16.1]</ref> I am in no pain that these imperfect Out-lines will be apply'd to the
            Person I mean, because every one who has the Happiness to know him must know how much
            more in this particular Attitude is wanting to be like him.</p>
          <p>The other Gentleman, whose bare Interjections of Laughter have humour in them, is so
            far from hiving a Title that he has lost his real name, which some Years ago he suffer'd
            his Friends to railly him out <pb n="17" entity="DSSR_000002909_0108"/> of; in lieu of
            which they have equipp'd him with one they thought had a better sound in good Company.
            He is the first Man of so sociable a Spirit that I ever knew capable of quitting the
            Allurements of Wit and Pleasure for a strong Application to Business; in his Youth (for
            there was a Time when he was young) he set out in all the hey-day Expences of a modish
            Man of Fortune; but finding himself over-weighted with Appetites, he grew restiff,
            kick'd up in the middle of the Course, and turn'd his back upon his Frolicks abroad, to
            think of improving his Estate at home: In order to which he clapt Collars upon his
            Coach-Horses, and that their Mettle might not run over other People, he ty'd a Plough to
            their Tails, which tho' it might give them a more slovenly Air, would enable him to keep
            them fatter in a foot pace, with a whistling Peasant beside them, than in a full trot,
            with a hot-headed Coachman behind them. In these unpolite Amusements he has laugh'd like
            a Rake and look'd about him like a Farmer for many Years. As his Rank and Station often
            find him in the best Company, his easy Humour, whenever he is called to it, can still
            make himself the Fiddle of it.</p>
          <p>And tho' some say he looks upon the Follies of the World like too severe a Philosopher,
            yet he rather chuses to laugh than to grieve at them; to pass his time therefore more
            easily in it, he often endeavours to conceal himself by assuming the Air and Taste of a
            Man in fashion; so that his only Uneasiness seems to be, that he cannot quite prevail
            with his <pb n="18" entity="DSSR_000002909_0109"/> Friends to think him a worse Manager
            than he really is; for they carry their Raillery to such a height that it sometimes
            rises to a Charge of downright Avarice against him. Upon which Head it is no easy matter
            to be more merry upon him than he will be upon himself. Thus while he sets that
            Infirmity in a pleasant Light, he so disarms your Prejudice, that if he has it not, you
            can't find in you Heart to wish he were without it. Whenever he is attack'd where he
            seems to lie so open, if his Wit happens not to be ready for you, he receives you with
            an assenting Laugh, till he has gain'd time enough to whet it sharp enough for a Reply,
            which seldom turns out to his disadvantage. If you are too strong for him (which may
            possibly happen from his being oblig'd to defend the weak side of the Question) his last
            Resource is to join in the Laugh till he has got himself off by an ironical Applause of
            your Superiority.</p>
          <p>If I were capable of Envy, what I have observ'd of this Gentleman would certainly
            incline me to it; for sure to get through the necessary Cares of Life with a Train of
            Pleasures at our Heels in vain calling after us, to give a constant Preference to the
            Business of the Day, and yet be able to laugh while we are about it, to make even
            Society the subservient Reward of it, is a State of Happiness which the gravest Precepts
            of moral Wisdom will not easily teach us to exceed. When I speak of Happiness, I go no
            higher than that which is contain'd in the World we <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0110"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0111"/>

            <pb n="19" entity="DSSR_000002909_0114"/> now tread upon; and when I speak of Laughter,
            I don't simply mean that which every Oaf is capable of, but that which has its sensible
            Motive and proper Season, which is not more limited than recommended by that indulgent
            Philosophy, <hi rend="italic">Cum ratione insanire</hi>. <ref target="n19-1" n="28"

            but there are among them a third Sort, who have the particular Happiness of unbending
            into the very Wantonness of Good-humour without depreciating their Dignity: He that is
            not Master of that Freedom, let his Condition be never so exalted, must still want
            something to come up to the Happiness of the Inferiors who enjoy it. If <hi

            with, sure then these chearful Amusements I am contending for must have no
            inconsiderable share in our Happiness; he that does not chuse to live his own way,
            suffers others to chuse for him. Give me the Joy I always took in the End of an old

          <p>We had once a merry Monarch of our own, who thought chearfulness so valuable a
            Blessing, that he would have quitted one of his Kingdoms where he cou'd not enjoy it;
            where, among many other Conditions they had ty'd him to, his sober Subjects wou'd not
            suffer him to laugh on a <hi rend="italic">Sunday;</hi> and tho' this might not be the

              n="23" entity="DSSR_000002909_0118"/> sure, had he had no other, that this alone might
            not have serv'd his turn; at least, he has my hearty Approbation either way; for had I
            been under the same Restriction, tho' my staying were to have made me his Successor, I
            shou'd rather have chosen to follow him.</p>
          <p>How far his Subjects might be in the right is not my Affair to determine; perhaps they
            were wiser than the Frogs in the Fable, and rather chose to have a Log than a Stork for
            their King; yet I hope it will be no Offence to say that King <hi rend="italic">Log</hi>
            himself must have made but a very simple Figure in History.</p>
          <p>The Man who chuses never to laugh, or whose becalm'd Passions know no Motion, seems to
            me only in the quiet State of a green Tree; he vegetates, 'tis true, but shall we say he
            lives? Now, Sir, for Amusement.&mdash;Reader, take heed! for I find a strong impulse
            to talk impertinently; if therefore you are not as fond of seeing, as I am of shewing
            myself in all my Lights, you may turn over two Leaves together, and leave what follows
            to those who have more Curiosity, and less to do with their Time, than you
            have.&mdash;As I was saying then, let us, for Amusement, advance this, or any other
            Prince, to the most glorious Throne, mark out his Empire in what Clime <pb n="24"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0119"/> you please, fix him on the highest Pinnacle of
            unbounded Power; and in that State let us enquire into his degree of Happiness; make him
            at once the Terror and the Envy of his Neighbours, send him Ambition out to War, and
            gratify it with extended Fame and Victories; bring him in triumph home, with great
            unhappy Captives behind him, through the Acclamations of his People, to repossess his
            Realms in Peace. Well, when the Dust has been brusht from his Purple, what will he do
            next? Why, this envy'd Monarch (who we will allow to have a more exalted Mind than to be
            delighted with the trifling Flatteries of a congratulating Circle) will chuse to retire,
            I presume, to enjoy in private the Contemplation of his Glory; an Amusement, you will
            say, that well becomes his Station! But there, in that pleasing Rumination, when he has
            made up his new Account of Happiness, how much, pray, will be added to the Balance more
            than as it stood before his last Expedition? From what one Article will the Improvement
            of it appear? Will it arise from the conscious Pride of having done his weaker Enemy an
            Injury? Are his Eyes so dazzled with false Glory that he thinks it a less Crime in him
            to break into the Palace of his Princely Neighbour, because he gave him time to defend
            it, than for a Subject feloniously to plunder the House of a private Man? Or is the
            Outrage of Hunger and Necessity more enormous than the Ravage of Ambition? Let us even
            suppose the wicked Usage of the World as to that Point may <pb n="25"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0120"/> keep his Conscience quiet; still, what is he to do with
            the infinite Spoil that his imperial Rapine has brought home? Is he to sit down and
            vainly deck himself with the Jewels which he has plunder'd from the Crown of another,
            whom Self-defence had compell'd to oppose him? No, let us not debase his Glory into so
            low a Weakness. What Appetite, then, are these shining Treasures food for? Is their vast
            Value in seeing his vulgar Subjects stare at them, wise Men smile at them, or his
            Children play with them? Or can the new Extent of his Dominions add a Cubit to his
            Happiness? Was not his Empire wide enough before to do good in ? And can it add to his
            Delight that now no Monarch has such room to do mischief in? But farther; if even the
            great <hi rend="italic">Augustus</hi>, to whose Reign such Praises are given, cou'd not
            enjoy his Days of Peace free from the Terrors of repeated Conspiracies, which lost him
            more Quiet to suppress than his Ambition cost him to provoke them: What human Eminence
            is secure? In what private Cabinet then must this wondrous Monarch lock up his Happiness
            that common Eyes are never to behold it? It is, like his Person, a Prisoner to its own
            Superiority? Or does he at last poorly place it in the Triumph of his injurious
            Devastations? One Moment's Search into himself will plainly shew him that real and
            reasonable Happiness can have no Existence without Innocence and Liberty. What a Mockery
            is Greatness without them? How lonesome must be the Life of that <pb n="26"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0121"/> Monarch who while he governs only by being fear'd, is
            restrain'd from letting down his Grandeur sometimes to forget himself and to humanize
            him into the Benevolence and Joy of Society? To throw off his cumbersome Robe of
            Majesty, to be a Man without disguise, to have a sensible Taste of Life in its
            Simplicity, till he confess from the sweet Experience that <hi rend="italic">dulce est
              desipere in loco</hi>
            <ref target="n26-1" n="35">[26.1]</ref> was no Fool's Philosophy. Or if the gawdy Charms
            of Pre-eminence are so strong that they leave him no Sense of a less pompous, tho' a
            more rational Enjoyment, none sure can envy him but those who are the Dupes of an
            equally fantastick Ambition.</p>
          <p>My imagination is quite heated and fatigued in dressing up this Phantome of Felicity;
            but I hope it has not made me so far misunderstood, as not to have allow'd that in all
            the Dispensations of Providence the Exercise of a great a virtuous Mind is the most
            elevated State of Happiness: No, Sir, I am not for setting up Gaiety against Wisdom; nor
            for preferring the Man of Pleasure to the Philosopher; but for shewing that the Wisest
            or greatest Man is very near an unhappy Man, if the unbending Amusements I am contending
            for are not sometimes admitted to relieve him.</p>
          <p>How far I may have over-rated these Amusements let graver Casuists decide; whether they
            affirm or reject what I have asserted hurts not my <pb n="27"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0122"/> Purpose; which is not to give Laws to others; but to
            shew by what Laws I govern myself: If I am misguided, 'tis Nature's Fault, and I follow
            her from this Persuasion; That as Nature has distinguish'd our Species from the mute
            Creation by our Risibility, her Design must have been by that Faculty as evidently to
            raise our Happiness, as by our <hi rend="italic">Os Sublime</hi>
            <ref target="n27-1" n="36">[27.1]</ref> (our erected Faces) to lift the Dignity of our
            Form above them.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding all I have said, I am afraid there is an absolute Power in what is
            simply call'd our Constitution that will never admit of other Rules for Happiness than
            her own; form which (be we never so wise or weak) without Divine Assistance we only can
            receive it; So that all this my Parade and Grimace of Philosophy has been only making a
            mighty Merit of following my own Inclination. A very natural Vanity! Though it is some
            sort of Satisfaction to know it does not impose upon me. Vanity again! However, think It
            what you will that has drawn me into this copious Digression, 'tis now high time to drop
            it: I shall therefore in my next Chapter return to my School, from whence I fear I have
            too long been Truant.</p>

            <p> This seems to be a favourite argument of Cibber. In his "Letter" to Pope, 1742, he

              one of his arguments being that the latter accusation, "without some particular

            <p> Cibber's "Apology" must have been a very profitable book. It was published in one
              volume quarto in 1740, and in the same year the second edition, one volume octavo, was
              issued. A third edition appeared in 1750, also in one volume octavo. Davies ("Dramatic
              Miscellanies," iii. 506) says: "Cibber must have raised considerable contributions on
              the public by his works. To say nothing of the sums accumulated by dedications,
              benefits, and the sale of his plays singly, his dramatic works, in quarto, by
              subscription, published 1721, produced him a considerable sum of money. It is computed
              that he gained, by the excellent Apology for his Life, no less than the sum of <hi
                rend="italic">&pound;</hi>1,500." "The Laureat" (1740) is perhaps Davies's
              authority for his computation. <hi rend="italic">"Ingenious indeed</hi>, who from such

              true) of Fifteen hundred Pounds"&mdash;"Laureat," p. 96.<lb/>Cibber no doubt kept
              the copyright of the first and second editions in his own hands. In 1750 he sold his
              copyright to Robert Dodsley for the sum of fifty guineas. The original assignment,

            <p> Mr. Laurence Hutton, in his "Literary Landmarks of London," page 52, says:
              "Southampton House, afterwards Bedford House, taken down in the beginning of the
              present century, occupied the north side of Bloomsbury Square. Evelyn speaks of it in
              his Diary, October, 1664, as in course of construction. Another and an earlier
              Southampton House in Holborn, 'a little above Holborn Bars,' was removed some twenty
              years before Cibber's birth. He was, therefore, probably born at the upper or north
              end of Southampton Street, facing Bloomsbury Square, where now are comparatively
              modern buildings, and not in Southampton Street, Strand, as is generally
            supposed."</p>

            interrupt or contradict me, sure, to say whatever I have a mind other People shou'd know
            of me is a Pleasure which none but Authors as vain as myself can conceive. But to my
            History.</p>
          <p>However little worth notice the Life of a Schoolboy may be supposed to contain, yet, as
            the Passions of Men and Children have much the same Motives and differ very little in
            their Effects, unless where the elder Experience may be able to conceal them: As
            therefore what arises from the Boy may possibly be a Lesson to the Man, I shall venture
            to relate a Fact or two that happen'd while I was still at School.</p>
          <p>In <hi rend="italic">February</hi>, 1684-5, died King <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi>
            II. who being the only King I had ever seen, I remember (young as I was) his Death made
            a strong Impression upon me, as it drew Tears from the Eyes of Multitudes, who looked no
            further into him than I <pb n="30" entity="DSSR_000002909_0125"/> did: But it was, then,
            a sort of School-Doctrine to regard our Monarch as a Deity; as in the former Reign it
            was to insist he was accountable to this World as well as to that above him. But what,
            perhaps, gave King <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi> II. this peculiar Possession of so
            many Hearts, was his affable and easy manner in conversing; which is a Quality that goes
            farther with the greater Part of Mankind than many higher Virtues, which, in a Prince,
            might more immediately regard the publick Prosperity. Even his indolent Amusement of
            playing with his Dogs and feeding his Ducks in St. <hi rend="italic">James's Park</hi>,
            (which I have seen him do) made the common People adore him, and consequently overlook
            in him what, in a Prince of a different Temper, they might have been out of humour at.</p>
          <p>I cannot help remembring one more Particular in those Times, tho' it be quite foreign
            to what will follow. I was carry'd by my Father to the Chapel in <hi rend="italic"
              >Whitehall;</hi> where I saw the King and his royal Brother the then Duke of <hi
              rend="italic">York</hi>, with him in the Closet, and present during the whole Divine
            Service. Such Dispensation, it seems, for his Interest, had that unhappy Prince from his
            real Religion, to assist at another to which his Heart was so utterly averse.
            &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I now proceed to the Facts I promis'd to speak of.</p>
          <p>King <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi> his Death was judg'd by our Schoolmaster a proper
            Subject to lead the Form I was in into a higher kind of Exercise; he therefore enjoin'd
              <pb n="31" entity="DSSR_000002909_0126"/> us severally to make his Funeral Oration:
            This sort of Task, so entirely new to us all, the Boys receiv'd with Astonishment as a
            Work above their Capacity; and tho' the Master persisted in his Command, they one and
            all, except myself, resolved to decline it. But I, Sir, who was ever giddily forward and
            thoughtless of Consequences, set myself roundly to work, and got through it as well as I
            could. I remember to this Hour that single Topick of his Affability (which made me
            mention it before) was the chief Motive that warm'd me into the Undertaking; and to shew
            how very childish a Notion I had of his Character at that time, I raised his Humanity,
            and Love of those who serv'd him, to such Height, that I imputed his Death to the Shock
            he receiv'd from the Lord <hi rend="italic">Arlington's</hi> being at the point of Death
            about a Week before him. <ref target="n31-1" n="38">[31.1]</ref> This Oration, such as
            it was, I produc'd the next Morning: All the other Boys pleaded their Inability, which
            the Master taking rather as a mark of their Modesty than their Idleness, only seem'd to
            punish by setting me at the Head of the Form: A Preferment dearly bought! Much happier
            had I been to have sunk my Performance in the general Modesty of declining it. A most
            uncomfortable Life I led among them for many a Day after! I was so jeer'd, laugh'd at,
            and hated as a pragmatical Bastard (School-boys Language) who had betray'd the whole
            Form, that <pb n="32" entity="DSSR_000002909_0127"/> scarce any of 'em wou'd keep me
            company; and tho' it so far advanc'd me into the Master's Favour that he wou'd often
            take me from the School to give me an Airing with him on Horseback, while they were left
            to their Lessons; you may be sure such envy'd Happiness did not encrease their Good-will
            to me: Notwithstanding which my Stupidity cou'd take no warning from their Treatment. An
            Accident of the same nature happen'd soon after, that might have frighten'd a Boy of a
            meek Spirit from attempting any thing above the lowest Capacity. On the 23d of <hi
              rend="italic">April</hi> following, being the Coronation-Day of the new King, the
            School petition'd the Master for leave to play; to which he agreed, provided any of the
            Boys would produce an <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Ode upon that
            Occasion.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The very Word, <hi rend="italic">Ode</hi>, I
            know makes you smile already ; and so it does me; not only because it still makes so
            many poor Devils turn Wits upon it, but from a more agreeable Motive; from a Reflection
            of how little I then thought that, half a Century afterwards, I shou'd be call'd upon
            twice a year, by my Post, <ref target="n32-1" n="39">[32.1]</ref> to make the same kind
            of Oblations to an <hi rend="italic">unexceptionable</hi> Prince, the serene Happiness
            of whose Reign my halting Rhimes are still so unequal to&mdash;This, I own, is
            Vanity without Disguise; but <hi rend="italic">H&aelig;c olim meminisse juvat:</hi>
            <ref target="n32-2" n="40">[32.2]</ref> The remembrance of the miserable prospect we had
            then before <pb n="33" entity="DSSR_000002909_0128"/> us, and have since escaped by a
            Revolution, is now a Pleasure which, without that Remembrance, I could not so heartily
            have enjoy'd. <ref target="n33-1" n="41">[33.1]</ref> The Ode I was speaking of fell to
            my Lot, which in about half an Hour I produc'd. I cannot say it was much above the merry
            Style of <hi rend="italic">Sing! Sing the Day, and sing the Song</hi>, in the Farce: Yet
            bad as it was, it serv'd to get the School a Play-day, and to make me not a little vain
            upon it; which last Effect so disgusted my Play-fellows that they left me out of the
            Party I had most a mind to be of in that Day's Recreation. But their Ingratitude serv'd
            only to increase my Vanity; for I consider'd them as so many beaten Tits that had just
            had the Mortification of seeing my Hack of a <hi rend="italic">Pegasus</hi> come in
            before them. This low Passion is so rooted in our Nature that sometimes riper Heads
            cannot govern it. I have met with much the same silly sort of Coldness, even from my
            Contemporaries of the Theatre, from having the superfluous capacity of writing myself
            the Characters I have acted.</p>
          <p>Here, perhaps, I may again seem to be vain; but if all these Facts are true (as true
            they are) how can I help it? Why am I oblig'd to conceal them? The Merit of the best of
            them is not so extraordinary as to have warn'd me to be nice upon it; and the Praise due
            to them is so small a Fish, it was scarce worth while to throw my Line into the Water
            for it. <pb n="34" entity="DSSR_000002909_0129"/> If I confess my Vanity while a Boy,
            can it be Vanity, when a Man, to remember it? And if I have a tolerable Feature, will
            not that as much belong to my Picture as an Imperfection? In a word, from what I have
            mentioned, I wou'd observe only this; That when we are conscious of the least
            comparative Merit in ourselves, we shou'd take as much care to conceal the Value we set
            upon it, as if it were a real Defect: To be elated or vain upon it is shewing your Money
            before People in want; ten to one but some who may think you to have too much may
            borrow, or pick your Pocket before you get home. He who assumes Praise to himself, the
            World will think overpays himself. Even the Suspicion of being vain ought as much to be
            dreaded as the Guilt itself. <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi> was of the same
            Opinion in regard to his Wife's Chastity. Praise, tho' it my be our due, is not like a
              <hi rend="italic">Bank-Bill</hi>, to be paid upon Demand; to be valuable it must be
            voluntary. When we are dun'd for it, we have a Right and Privilege to refuse it. If
            Compulsion insists upon it, it can only be paid as Persecution in Points of Faith is, in
            a counterfeit Coin: And who ever believ'd Occasional Conformity to be sincere? <hi
              rend="italic">Nero</hi>, the most vain Coxcomb of a Tyrant that ever breath'd, cou'd
            not raise an unfeigned Applause of his Harp by military Execution; even where Praise is
            deserv'd, Ill-nature and Self-conceit (Passions that poll a majority of Mankind) will
            with less reluctance part with their Mony than their Approbation. Men of the greatest
              <pb n="35" entity="DSSR_000002909_0130"/> Merit are forced to stay 'till they die
            before the World will fairly make up their Account: Then indeed you have a Chance for
            your full Due, because it is less grudg'd when you are incapable of enjoying it: Then
            perhaps even Malice shall heap Praises upon your Memory; tho' not for your sake, but
            that your surviving Competitors may suffer by a Comparison. <ref target="n35-1" n="42"
              >[35.1]</ref> 'Tis from the same Principle that <hi rend="italic">Satyr</hi> shall
            have a thousand Readers where <hi rend="italic">Panegyric</hi> has one. When I therefore
            find my Name at length in the Satyrical Works of our most celebrated living Author, I
            never look upon those Lines as Malice meant to me, (for he knows I never provok'd it)
            but Profit to himself: One of his Points must be, to have many Readers: He considers
            that my Face and Name are more known than those of many thousands of more consequence in
            the Kingdom: That therefore, right or wrong, a Lick at the <hi rend="italic">Laureat</hi>
            <ref target="n35-2" n="43">[35.2]</ref> will <pb n="36" entity="DSSR_000002909_0131"/>
            always be a sure Bait, <hi rend="italic">ad captandum vulgus</hi>, to catch him little
            Readers: And that to gratify the Unlearned, by now and then interspersing those merry
            Sacrifices of an old Acquaintance to their Taste, is a piece of quite right Poetical
            Craft. <ref target="n36-1" n="44">[36.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>But as a little bad Poetry is the greatest Crime he lays to my charge, I am willing to
            subscribe to his opinion of <hi rend="italic">it</hi>. <ref target="n36-2" n="45"
            >[36.2]</ref> That this sort of Wit is one of the <pb n="37"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0132"/> easiest ways too of pleasing the generality of Readers,
            is evident from the comfortable subsistence which our weekly Retailers of Politicks have
            been known to pick up, merely by making bold with a Government that had unfortunately
            neglected to find their Genius a better Employment.</p>
          <p>Hence too arises all that flat Poverty of Censure and Invective that so often has a Run
            in our publick Papers upon the Success of a new Author; when, God knows, there is seldom
            above one Writer among hundreds in Being at the same time whose Satyr a Man of common
            Sense ought to be mov'd at. When a Master in the Art is angry, then indeed we ought to
            be alarm'd! How terrible a Weapon is Satyr in the Hand of a great Genius? Yet even <pb
              n="38" entity="DSSR_000002909_0133"/> there, how liable is Prejudice to misuse it? How
            far, when general, it may reform our Morals, or what Cruelties it may inflict by being
            angrily particular, <ref target="n38-1" n="46">[38.1]</ref> is perhaps above my reach to
            determine. I shall therefore only beg leave to interpose what I feel for others whom it
            may personally have fallen upon. When I read those mortifying Lines of our most eminent
            Author, in his Character of <hi rend="italic">Atticus</hi>
            <ref target="n38-2" n="47">[38.2]</ref> (<hi rend="italic">Atticus</hi>, whose Genius in
            Verse and whose Morality in Prose has been so justly admir'd) though I am charm'd with
            the Poetry, my Imagination is hurt at the Severity of it; and tho' I allow the Satyrist
            to have had personal Provocation, yet, methinks, for that very Reason he ought not to
            have troubled the Publick with it: For, as it is observed in the 242d <hi rend="italic"
              >Tatler</hi>, "In all Terms of Reproof, when the Sentence "appears to arise from
            Personal Hatred or "Passion, it is not then made the Cause of Mankind, "but a
            Misunderstanding between two Persons." But if such kind of Satyr has its incontestable
            Greatness; if its exemplary Brightness may not mislead inferior Wits into a barbarous
            Imitation of its Severity, then I have only admir'd the Verses, and expos'd myself by
            bringing them under so scrupulous a Reflexion: But the Pain which the Acrimony of those
            Verses gave me is, in some measure, <pb n="39" entity="DSSR_000002909_0134"/> allay'd in
            finding that this inimitable Writer, as he advances in Years, has since had Candour
            enough to celebrate the same Person for his visible Merit. Happy Genius! whose Verse,
            like the Eye of Beauty, can heal the deepest Wounds with the least Glance of Favour.</p>
          <p>Since I am got so far into this Subject, you must give me leave to go thro' all I have
            a mind to say upon it; because I am not sure that in a more proper Place my Memory may
            be so full of it. I cannot find, therefore, from what Reason Satyr is allow'd more
            Licence than Comedy, or why either of them (to be admir'd) ought not to be limited by
            Decency and Justice. Let <hi rend="italic">Juvenal</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
              >Aristophanes</hi> have taken what Liberties they please, if the Learned have nothing
            more than their Antiquity to justify their laying about them at that enormous rate, I
            shall wish they had a better excuse for them! The Personal Ridicule and Scurrility
            thrown upon <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi>, which <hi rend="italic">Plutarch</hi> too
            condemns; and the Boldness of <hi rend="italic">Juvenal</hi>, in writing real Names over
            guilty Characters, I cannot think are to be pleaded in right of our modern Liberties of
            the same kind. <hi rend="italic">Facit indignatio versum</hi>
            <ref target="n39-1" n="48">[39.1]</ref> may be a very spirited Expression, and seems to
            give a Reader hopes of a lively Entertainment: But I am afraid Reproof is in unequal
            Hands when Anger is its Executioner; and tho' an outrageous Invective may carry some
            Truth in it, yet it will never have that natural, easy Credit <pb n="40"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0135"/> with us which we give to the laughing Ironies of a cool
            Head. The Satyr that can smile <hi rend="italic">circum pr&aelig;cordia ludit</hi>,
            and seldom fails to bring the Reader quite over to his Side whenever Ridicule and folly
            are at variance. But when a Person satyriz'd is us'd with the extreamest Rigour, he may
            sometimes meet with Compassion instead of Contempt, and throw back the Odium that was
            designed for him, upon the Author. When I would therefore disarm the Satyrist of this
            Indignation, I mean little more than that I would take from him all private or personal
            Prejudice, and wou'd still leave him as much general Vice to scourge as he pleases, and
            that with as much Fire and Spirit as Art and Nature demand to enliven his Work and keep
            his Reader awake.</p>
          <p>Against all this it may be objected, That these are Laws which none but phlegmatick
            Writers will observe, and only Men of Eminence should give. I grant it, and therefore
            only submit them to Writers of better Judgment. I pretend not to restrain others from
            chusing what I don't like; they are welcome (if they please too) to think I offer these
            Rules more from an Incapacity to break them than from a moral Humanity. Let it be so!
            still, That will not weaken the strength of what I have asserted, if my Assertion be
            true. And though I allow that Provocation is not apt to weigh out its Resentments by
            Drachms and Scruples, I shall still think that no publick Revenge can be honourable
            where it is not limited by Justice; and if Honour is insatiable in its Revenge it <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0136"/> loses what it contends for and sinks itself, if not
            into Cruelty, at least into Vain-glory.</p>
          <p>This so singular Concern which I have shewn for others may naturally lead you to ask me
            what I feel for myself when I am unfavourably treated by the elaborate Authors of our
            daily Papers. <ref target="n41-1" n="49">[41.1]</ref> Shall I be sincere? and own my
            frailty? Its usual Effect is to make me vain! For I consider if I were quite good for
            nothing these Pidlers in Wit would not be concern'd to take me to pieces, or (not to be
            quite so vain) when they moderately charge me with only Ignorance or Dulness, I see
            nothing in That which an honest Man need be asham'd of: <ref target="n41-2" n="50"
              >[41.2]</ref> There is many a good Soul who from those sweet Slumbers of the Brain are
            never awaken'd by the least harmful Thought; and I am <pb n="42"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0137"/> sometimes tempted to think those Retailers of Wit may
            be of the same Class; that what they write proceeds not from Malice, but Industry; and
            that I ought no more to reproach them than I would a Lawyer that pleads against me for
            his Fee; that their Detraction, like Dung thrown upon a Meadow, tho' it may seem at
            first to deform the Prospect, in a little time it will disappear of itself and leave an
            involuntary Crop of Praise behind it.</p>
          <p>When they confine themselves to a sober Criticism upon what I write; if their Censure
            is just, what answer can I make to it? If it is unjust, why should I suppose that a
            sensible Reader will not see it, as well as myself? Or, admit I were able to expose them
            by a laughing Reply, will not that Reply beget a Rejoinder? And though they might be
            Gainers by having the worst on't in a Paper War, that is no Temptation for me to come
            into it. Or (to make both sides less considerable) would not my bearing Ill-language
            from a Chimney-sweeper do me less harm than it would be to box with him, tho' I were
            sure to beat him? Nor indeed is the little Reputation I have as an Author worth the
            trouble of a Defence. Then, as no Criticism can possibly make me worse than I really am;
            so nothing I can say of myself can possibly make me better: When therefore a determin'd
            Critick comes arm'd with Wit and Outrage to take from me that small Pittance I have, I
            wou'd no more dispute with him than I wou'd resist a Gentleman of the Road to save a
            little Pocket- <pb n="43" entity="DSSR_000002909_0138"/> Money. <ref target="n43-1"
              n="51">[43.1]</ref> Men that are in want themselves seldom make a Conscience of taking
            it from others. Whoever thinks I have too much is welcome to what share of it he
            pleases: Nay, to make him more merciful (as I partly guess the worst he can say of what
            I now write) I will prevent even the Imputation of his doing me Injustice, and honestly
            say it myself, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. That of all the Assurances I was ever guilty
            of, this of writing my own Life is the most hardy. I beg his Pardon!&mdash;-Impudent
            is what I should have said! That through every Page there runs a Vein of Vanity and
            Impertinence which no <hi rend="italic">French Ensigns memoires</hi> ever came up to;
            but, as this is a common Error, I presume the Terms of <hi rend="italic">Doating
              Trifler, Old Fool,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Conceited Coxcomb</hi> will carry
            Contempt enough for an impartial Censor to bestow on me; that my style is unequal, pert,
            and frothy, patch'd and party-colour'd like the Coat of an <hi rend="italic"
            >Harlequin</hi>; low and pompous, cramm'd with Epithets, strew'd with Scraps of
            second-hand <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi> from common Quotations; frequently aiming at
            Wit, without ever hitting the Mark; a mere Ragoust toss'd up from the offals of other

            nothing but Wit to be as accomplish'd a Coxcomb here as ever I attempted to expose on
            the Theatre: Nay, that this very Confession is no more a Sign of my Modesty than it is a

          <p>Well, Sir Critick! and what of all this? Now I have laid myself at your Feet, what will
            you do with me? Expose me? Why, dear Sir, does not every Man that writes expose himself?
            Can you make me a Blockhead, or perhaps might pleasantly tell other People they ought to
            think me so too. Will not they judge as well from what <hi rend="italic">I</hi> say as
            what <hi rend="italic">You</hi> say? If then you attack me merely to divert yourself,
            your Excuse for writing will be no better than mine. But perhaps you may want Bread: If

          <p>If our best Authors, when teiz'd by these Triflers, have not been Masters of this
            Indifference, I should not wonder if it were disbeliev'd in me; but when it is

              target="n45-1" n="53">[45.1]</ref> the Matter then may not seem so incredible: And
            tho' I confess the complete Revenge of making them Immortal Dunces in Immortal Verse
            might be glorious; yet, if you will call it Insensibility in me never to have winc'd at
            them, even that Insensibility has its happiness, and what could Glory give me more? <ref
              target="n45-2" n="54">[45.2]</ref> For my part, I have always had the comfort to
            think, whenever they design'd me a Disfavour, it generally flew back into their own
            Faces, as it happens to Children when they squirt at their Play-fellows against the
            Wind. If a Scribbler cannot be easy because he fancies I have too good an Opinion of my
            own Productions, let him write on and mortify; I owe him not the Charity to be out of
            temper myself merely to keep him quiet or give him Joy: Nor, in reality, can I see why
            any thing misrepresented, tho' believ'd of me by Persons to whom I am unknown, ought to

          <p>You see, Sir, how hard it is for a Man that is talking of himself to know when to give
            over; but if you are tired, lay me aside till you have a fresh Appetite; if not, I'll
            tell you a Story.</p>
          <p>In the Year 1730 there were many Authors whose Merit wanted nothing but Interest to
            recommend them to the vacant <hi rend="italic">Laurel</hi>, and who took it ill to see
            it at last conferred upon a Comedian; insomuch, that they were resolved at least to shew
            specimens of their superior Pretensions, and accordingly enliven'd the publick Papers
            with ingenious Epigrams and satyrical Flirts at the unworthy Successor: <ref
              target="n46-1" n="55">[46.1]</ref> These Papers my Friends with a wicked Smile would
            often put into my Hands and desire me to read them fairly in Company: This was a
            Challenge which I never declin'd, and, to do my doughty Antagonists Justice, I always
            read them <pb n="47" entity="DSSR_000002909_0142"/> with as much impartial Spirit as if
            I had writ them myself. While I was thus beset on all sides, there happen'd to step
            forth a poetical Knight-Errant to my Assistance, who was hardy enough to publish some
            compassionate Stanzas in my Favour. These, you may be sure, the Raillery of my Friends
            could do no less than say I had written to myself. To deny it I knew would but have
            confirmed their pretended Suspicion: I therefore told them, since it gave them such Joy
            to believe them my own, I would do my best to make the whole Town think so too. As the
            Oddness of this Reply was I knew what would not be easily comprehended, I desired them
            to have a Days patience, and I would print an Explanation to it: To conclude, in two
            Days after I sent this Letter, with some doggerel Rhimes at the Bottom, </p>

          <p>This, Sir, I offer as a Proof that I was seven Years ago <ref target="n50-1" n="58"
              >[50.1]</ref> the same cold Candidate for Fame which I would still be thought; you
            will not easily suppose I could have much Concern about it, while, to gratify the merry
            Pique of my Friends, I was capable of seeming to head the Poetical Cry then against me,
            and at the same Time of never letting the Publick know 'till this Hour that these Verses
            were written by myself: Nor do I give them you as an Entertainment, but merely to shew
            you this particular Cast of my Temper.</p>
          <p>When I have said this, I would not have it thought Affectation in me when I grant that
            no Man worthy the Name of an Author is a more faulty Writer than myself; that I am not
            Master of my own Language <ref target="n50-2" n="59">[50.2]</ref>
            <pb n="51" entity="DSSR_000002909_0146"/> I too often feel when I am at a loss for
            Expression: I know too that I have too bold a Disregard for that Correctness which
            others set so just a Value upon: This I ought to be ashamed of, when I find that
            Persons, perhaps of colder Imaginations, are allowed to write better than myself.
            Whenever I speak of any thing that highly delights me, I find it very difficult to keep
            my Words within the Bounds of Common Sense: Even when I write too, the same Failing will
            sometimes get the better of me; of which I cannot give you a stronger Instance than in
            that wild Expression I made use of in the first Edition of my Preface to the <hi
              rend="italic">Provok'd Husband;</hi> where, speaking of Mrs. <hi rend="italic"
              >Oldfield</hi>'s excellent Performance in the Part of Lady <hi rend="italic"
            >Townly</hi>, my Words ran thus, <hi rend="italic">viz. It is not enough to say, that
              here she outdid</hi> her usual <hi rend="italic">Outdoing</hi>. <ref target="n51-1"
              n="60">[51.1]</ref> &mdash;A most vile Jingle, I grant it! You may well ask me,
            How could I possibly commit such a Wantonness to Paper? And I owe myself the Shame of
            confessing I have no Excuse for it but that, like a Lover in the Fulness of his Content,
            by endeavouring to be floridly grateful I talk'd Nonsense. Not but it makes me smile to
            remember how many flat Writers have made themselves brisk upon this single Expression;
            wherever the <pb n="52" entity="DSSR_000002909_0147"/> Verb, <hi rend="italic"
            >Outdo</hi>, could come in, the pleasant Accusative, <hi rend="italic">Outdoing</hi>,
            was sure to follow it. The provident Wags knew that <hi rend="italic">Decies repetita
              placeret:</hi>
            <ref target="n52-1" n="61">[52.1]</ref> so delicious a Morsel could not be serv'd up too
            often! After it had held them nine times told for a Jest, the Publick has been pester'd
            with a tenth Skull thick enough to repeat it. Nay, the very learned in the Law have at
            last facetiously laid hold of it! Ten Years after it first came from me it served to
            enliven the eloquence of an eloquent Pleader before a House of Parliament! What Author
            would not envy me so frolicksome a Fault that had such publick Honours paid to it?</p>
          <p>After this Consciousness of my real Defects, you will easily judge, Sir, how little I
            presume that my Poetical Labours may outlive those of my mortal <hi rend="italic"
              >Cotemporaries</hi>. <ref target="n52-2" n="62">[52.2]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>At the same time that I am so humble in my Pretensions to Fame, I would not be thought
            to undervalue it; Nature will not suffer us to despise it, but she may sometimes make us
            too fond of it. I have known more than one good Writer very near ridiculous from being
            in too much Heat about it. Whoever instrinsically deserves it will always have a
            proportionable <pb n="53" entity="DSSR_000002909_0148"/> Right to it. It can neither be
            resign'd nor taken from you by Violence. Truth, which is unalterable, must (however his
            Fame may be contested) give every Man his Due: What a Poem weighs it will be worth; nor
            is it in the Power of Human Eloquence, with Favour or Prejudice, to increase or diminish
            its Value. Prejudice, 'tis true, may a while discolour it; but it will always have its
            Appeal to the Equity of good Sense, which will never fail in the End to reverse all
            false Judgment against it. Therefore when I see an eminent Author hurt, and impatient at
            an impotent Attack upon his Labours, he disturbs my Inclination to admire him; I grow
            doubtful of the favourable Judgment I have made of him, and am quite uneasy to see him
            so tender in Point he cannot but know he ought not himself to be judge of; his Concern
            indeed at another's Prejudice or Disapprobation may be natural; but to own it seems to
            me a natural Weakness. When a Work is apparently great it will go without Crutches; all
            your Art and Anxiety to heighten the Fame of it then becomes low and little. <ref
              target="n53-1" n="63">[53.1]</ref> He that will bear no Censure must be often robb'd
            of his due Praise. Fools have as good a Right to be Readers as Men of Sense have, and
            why not to give <pb n="54" entity="DSSR_000002909_0149"/> their Judgments too? Methinks
            it would be a sort of Tyranny in Wit for an Author to be publickly putting every
            Argument to death that appear'd against him; so absolute a Demand for Approbation puts
            us upon our Right to dispute it; Praise is as much the Reader's Property as Wit is the
            Author's; Applause is not a Tax paid to him as a Prince, but rather a Benevolence given
            to him as a Beggar; and we have naturally more Charity for the dumb Beggar than the
            sturdy one. The Merit of a Writer and a fine Woman's Face are never mended by their
            talking of them: How amiable is she that seems not to know she is handsome!</p>
          <p>To conclude; all I have said upon this Subject is much better contained in six Lines of
            a Reverend Author, which will be an Answer to all critical Censure for ever.</p>

            <p> Bellchambers prints these words thus: "Lick at the Laureat," as if Cibber had
              referred to the title of a book; and notes: "This is the title of a pamphlet in which
              some of Mr. Cibber's peculiarities have been severely handled." But I doubt this, for
              there is nothing in Cibber's arrangement of the words to denote that they represent
              the title of a book; and, besides, I know no work with such a title published before
              1740. Bellchambers, in a note on page 114, represents that he quotes from "Lick at the
              Laureat, 1730;" but I find the quotation he gives in "The Laureat," 1740 (p. 31),
              almost <hi rend="italic">verbatim</hi>. As it stands in the latter there is no hint
              that it is quoted from a previous work, nor, indeed, do the terms of it permit of such
              an interpretation. I can, therefore, only suppose that Bellchambers is wrong in
              attributing the sentence to a work called "A Lick at the Laureat."</p>

            <p> Cibber's Odes were a fruitful subject of banter. Fielding in "Pasquin," act ii. sc.

              don't much care what it is, provided I wear fine Cloaths, and have something to do in
              the Kitchen, or the Cellar; I own I should like the Cellar, for I am a divilish Lover
              of Sack.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Lord Place</hi>. Sack, say you? Odso, you shall be Poet-Laureat.</p>

            <p>Again ("Joseph Andrews," book iii. chap. vi.), addressing the Muse or Genius that

          <p>I AM now come to that Crisis of my Life when Fortune seem'd to be at a Loss what she
            should do with me. Had she favour'd my Father's first Designation of me, he might then,
            perhaps, have had as sanguine Hopes of my being a Bishop as I afterwards conceived of my
            being a General when I first took Arms at the Revolution. Nay, after that I <pb n="56"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0151"/> had a third Chance too, equally as good, of becoming an
            Under-propper of the State. How at last I came to be none of all these the Sequel will
            inform you.</p>
          <p>About the Year 1687 I was taken from School to stand at the Election of Children into
              <hi rend="italic">Winchester</hi> College; my being by my Mother's Side a Descendant
              <ref target="n56-1" n="65">[56.1]</ref> of <hi rend="italic">William</hi> of <hi
              rend="italic">Wickam</hi>, the Founder, my Father (who knew little how the World was
            to be dealt with) imagined my having that Advantage would be Security enough for my
            Success, and so sent me simply down thither, without the least favourable Recommendation
            or Interest, but that of my naked Merit and a pompous Pedigree in my Pocket. Had he
            tack'd a Direction to my Back, and sent me by the Carrier to the Mayor of the Town, to
            be chosen Member of Parliament there, I might have had just as much Chance to have
            succeeded in the one as the other. But I must not omit in this Place to let you know
            that the Experience which my Father then bought, at my Cost, taught him some Years after
            to take a more judicious Care of my younger Brother, <hi rend="italic">Lewis
            Cibber</hi>, whom, with the Present of a Statue of the Founder, of his own making, he
            recommended to the same College. This Statue now stands (I think) over the School Door
            there, <ref target="n56-2" n="66">[56.2]</ref> and was so well <pb n="57"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0152"/> executed that it seem'd to
            speak&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;for its Kinsman. It was no sooner set up than the
            Door of Preferment was open to him.</p>
          <p>Here one would think my Brother had the Advantage of me in the Favour of Fortune, by
            this his first laudable Step into the World. I own I was so proud of his Success that I
            even valued myself upon it; and yet it is but a melancholy Reflection to observe how
            unequally his Profession and mine were provided for; when I, who had been the Outcast of
            Fortune, could find means, from my Income of the Theatre, before I was my own Master
            there, to supply in his highest Preferment his common Necessities. I cannot part with
            his Memory without telling you I had as sincere a Concern for this Brother's Well-being
            as my own. He had lively Parts and more than ordinary Learning, with a good deal of
            natural Wit and Humour; but from too great a disregard to his Health he died a Fellow of
              <hi rend="italic">New College</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Oxford</hi> soon after he had
            been ordained by Dr. <hi rend="italic">Compton</hi>, then Bishop of <hi rend="italic"
              >London</hi>. I now return to the State of my own Affair at <hi rend="italic"
              >Winchester.</hi></p>
          <p>After the Election, the Moment I was inform'd that I was one of the unsuccessful
            Candidates, I blest myself to think what a happy Reprieve I had got from the confin'd
            Life of a School-boy! and the same Day took Post back to <hi rend="italic">London</hi>,
            that I might arrive time enough to see a Play (then my darling Delight) before my Mother
            might demand an Account of my travelling Charges. When I look back to that Time, <pb
              n="58" entity="DSSR_000002909_0153"/> it almost makes me tremble to think what
            Miseries, in fifty Years farther in Life, such an unthinking Head was liable to! To ask
            why Providence afterwards took more Care of me than I did of myself, might be making too
            bold an Enquiry into its secret Will and Pleasure: All I can say to that Point is, that
            I am thankful and amazed at it! <ref target="n58-1" n="67">[58.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>'Twas about this time I first imbib'd an Inclination, which I durst not reveal, for the
            Stage; for besides that I knew it would disoblige my Father, I had no Conception of any
            means practicable to make my way to it. I therefore suppress'd the bewitching Ideas of
            so sublime a Station, and compounded with my Ambition by laying a lower Scheme, of only
            getting the nearest way into the immediate Life of a Gentleman-Collegiate. My Father
            being at this time employ'd at <hi rend="italic">Chattsworth</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
              >Derbyshire</hi> by the <pb n="59" entity="DSSR_000002909_0154"/> (then) Earl of <hi
              rend="italic">Devonshire</hi>, who was raising that Seat from a <hi rend="italic"
              >Gothick</hi> to a <hi rend="italic">Grecian</hi> Magnificence, I made use of the
            Leisure I then had in <hi rend="italic">London</hi> to open to him by Letter my
            Disinclination to wait another Year for an uncertain Preferment at <hi rend="italic"
              >Winchester</hi>, and to entreat him that he would send me, <hi rend="italic">per
              saltum</hi>, by a shorter Cut, to the University. My Father, who was naturally
            indulgent to me, seem'd to comply with my Request, and wrote word that as soon as his
            Affairs would permit, he would carry me with him and settle me in some College, but
            rather at <hi rend="italic">Cambridge</hi>, where (during his late Residence at that
            Place, in making some Statues that now stand upon <hi rend="italic">Trinity</hi> College
            New Library) he had contracted some Acquaintance with the Heads of Houses, who might
            assist his Intentions for me. <ref target="n59-1" n="68">[59.1]</ref> This I lik'd <pb
              n="60" entity="DSSR_000002909_0155"/> better than to go discountenanc'd to <hi
              rend="italic">Oxford</hi>, to which it would have been a sort of Reproach to me not to
            have come elected. After some Months were elaps'd, my Father, not being willing to let
            me lie too long idling in <hi rend="italic">London</hi>, sent for me down to <hi
              rend="italic">Chattsworth</hi>, to be under his Eye, till he cou'd be at leisure to
            carry me to <hi rend="italic">Cambridge</hi>. Before I could set out on my Journey
            thither, the Nation fell in labour of the Revolution, the News being then just brought
            to <hi rend="italic">London</hi> That the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Orange</hi> at the
            Head of an Army was landed in the <hi rend="italic">West</hi>. <ref target="n60-1"
              n="69">[60.1]</ref> When I came to <hi rend="italic">Nottingham</hi>, I found my
            Father in Arms there, among those Forces which the Earl of <hi rend="italic"
            >Devonshire</hi> had rais'd for the Redress of our violated Laws and Liberties. My
            Father judg'd this a proper Season for a young Strippling to turn himself loose into the
            Bustle of the World; and being himself too advanc'd in Years to endure the Winter
            Fatigue which might possibly follow, entreated that noble Lord that he would be pleas'd
            to accept of his Son in his room, and that he would give him (my Father) leave to return
            and finish his Works at <hi rend="italic">Chattsworth</hi>. This was so well receiv'd by
            his Lordship that he not only admitted of my Service, but promis'd my <pb n="61"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0156"/> Father in return that when Affairs were settled he
            would provide for me. Upon this my Father return'd to <hi rend="italic">Derbyshire</hi>,
            while I, not a little transported, jump'd into his Saddle. Thus in one Day all my
            Thoughts of the University were smother'd in Ambition! A slight Commission for a
            Horse-Officer was the least View I had before me. At this Crisis you cannot but observe
            that the Fate of King <hi rend="italic">James</hi> and of the Prince of <hi
              rend="italic">Orange</hi>, and that of so minute a Being as my self, were all at once
            upon the Anvil: In what shape they wou'd severally come out, tho' a good <hi
              rend="italic">Guess</hi> might be made, was not then <hi rend="italic"
            >demonstrable</hi> to the deepest Foresight; but as my Fortune seem'd to be of small
            Importance to the Publick, Providence thought fit to postpone it 'till that of those
            great Rulers of Nations was justly perfected. Yet, had my Father's Business permitted
            him to have carried me one Month sooner (as he intended) to the University, who knows
            but by this time that purer Fountain might have wash'd my Imperfections into a Capacity
            of writing (instead of Plays and Annual Odes) Sermons and Pastoral Letters. But whatever
            Care of the Church might so have fallen to my share, as I dare say it may be now in
            better Hands, I ought not to repine at my being otherwise disposed of. <ref

          <p>You must now consider me as one among those desperate Thousands, who, after a Patience
            sorely try'd, took Arms under the Banner of Necessity, the natural Parent of all Human
            Laws and Government. I question if in all the Histories of Empire there is one Instance
            of so bloodless a Revolution as that in <hi rend="italic">England</hi> in 1688, wherein
            Whigs, Tories, Princes, Prelates, Nobles, Clergy, common People, and a Standing Army,
            were unanimous. To have seen all <hi rend="italic">England</hi> of one Mind is to have
            liv'd at a very particular Juncture. Happy Nation! who are never divided among
            themselves but when they have least to complain of! Our greatest Grievance since that
            Time seems to have been that we cannot all govern; and 'till the Number of good Places
            are equal to those who think themselves qualified for them there must ever be a Cause of
            Contention among us. While Great Men want great Posts, the Nation will never want real
            or seeming Patriots; and while great Posts are fill'd with Persons whose Capacities are
            but Human, such Persons will never be allow'd to be without Errors; not even the
            Revolution, with all its Advantages, it seems, has been able to furnish us with
            unexceptionable Statesmen! for from that time I don't remember any one Set of Ministers
            that have not been heartily rail'd at; a Period long enough one would think (if all of
            them have been as bad as they have been call'd) to make a People despair of ever seeing
            a good one: But as it is possible that Envy, Prejudice, or Party may sometimes have a
              <pb n="63" entity="DSSR_000002909_0158"/> share in what is generally thrown upon 'em,
            it is not easy for a private Man to know who is absolutely in the right from what is
            said against them, or from what their Friends or Dependants may say in their Favour:
            Tho' I can hardly forbear thinking that they who have been <hi rend="italic"
            >longest</hi> rail'd at, must from that Circumstance shew in some sort a Proof of
            Capacity. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But to my History.</p>
          <p>It were almost incredible to tell you, at the latter end of King <hi rend="italic"
              >James's</hi> Time (though the Rod of Arbitrary Power was always shaking over us) with
            what Freedom and Contempt the common People in the open Streets talk'd of his wild
            Measures to make a whole Protestant Nation Papists; and yet, in the height of our secure
            and wanton Defiance of him, we of the Vulgar had no farther Notion of any Remedy for
            this Evil than a satisfy'd Presumption that our Numbers were too great to be master'd by
            his mere Will and Pleasure; that though he might be too hard for our Laws, he would
            never be able to get the better of our Nature; and that to drive all <hi rend="italic"
              >England</hi> into Popery and Slavery he would find would be teaching an old Lion to
            dance. <ref target="n63-1" n="71">[63.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <pb n="64" entity="DSSR_000002909_0159"/>
          <p>But happy was it for the Nation that it had then wiser Heads in it, who knew how to
            lead a People so dispos'd into Measures for the Publick Preservation.</p>
          <p>Here I cannot help reflecting on the very different Deliverances <hi rend="italic"
              >England</hi> met with at this Time and in the very same Year of the Century before:
            Then (in 1588) under a glorious Princess, who had at heart the Good and Happiness of her
            People, we scatter'd and destroy'd the most formidable Navy of Invaders that ever
            cover'd the Seas: And now (in 1688) under a Prince who had alienated the Hearts of his
            People by his absolute Measures to oppress them, a foreign Power is receiv'd with open
            Arms in defence of our Laws, Liberties, and Religion, which our native Prince had
            invaded! How widely different were these two Monarchs in their Sentiments of Glory! But,
              <hi rend="italic">Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum.</hi>
            <ref target="n64-1" n="72">[64.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>When we consider in what height of the Nation's Prosperity the Successor of Queen <hi
              rend="italic">Elizabeth</hi> came to this Throne, it seems amazing that such a Pile of
              <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Fame and Glory, which her skilful Administration <pb
              n="65" entity="DSSR_000002909_0160"/> had erected, should in every following Reign
            down to the Revolution so unhappily moulder away in one continual Gradation of Political
            Errors: All which must have been avoided, if the plain Rule which that wise Princess
            left behind her had been observed, <hi rend="italic">viz. That the Love of her People
              was the surest Support of her Throne.</hi> This was the Principle by which she so
            happily govern'd herself and those she had the Care of. In this she found Strength to
            combat and struggle thro' more Difficulties and dangerous Conspiracies than ever <hi
              rend="italic">English</hi> Monarch had to cope with. At the same time that she
            profess'd to <hi rend="italic">desire</hi> the People's Love, she took care that her
            Actions shou'd <hi rend="italic">deserve</hi> it, without the least Abatement of her
            Prerogative; the Terror of which she so artfully covered that she sometimes seem'd to
            flatter those she was determin'd should obey. If the four following Princes had
            exercis'd their Regal Authority with so visible a Regard to the Publick Welfare, it were
            hard to know whether the People of <hi rend="italic">England</hi> might have ever
            complain'd of them, or even felt the want of that Liberty they now so happily enjoy.
            'Tis true that before her Time our Ancestors had many successful Contests with their
            Sovereigns for their <hi rend="italic">ancient Right</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
            >Claim</hi> to it; yet what did those Successes amount to? little more than a
            Declaration that there was such a Right in being; but who ever saw it enjoy'd? Did not
            the Actions of almost every succeeding Reign shew there were still so many Doors of <pb
              n="66" entity="DSSR_000002909_0161"/> Oppression left open to the Prerogative that
            (whatever Value our most eloquent Legislators may have set upon those ancient Liberties)
            I doubt it will be difficult to fix the Period of their having a real Being before the
            Revolution: Or if there ever was an elder Period of our unmolested enjoying them, I own
            my poor Judgment is at a loss where to place it. I will boldly say then, it is to the
            Revolution only we owe the full Possession of what, 'till then, we never had more than a
            perpetually contested Right to: And, from thence, from the Revolution it is that the
            Protestant Successors of King <hi rend="italic">William</hi> have found their Paternal
            Care and Maintenance of that Right has been the surest Basis of their Glory. <ref
              target="n66-1" n="73">[66.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>These, Sir, are a few of my Political Notions, which I have ventur'd to expose that you
            may see what sort of an <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Subject I am; how wise or weak
            they may have shewn me is not my Concern; let the weight of these Matters have drawn me
            never so far out of my Depth, I still flatter myself that I have kept a simple, honest
            Head above Water. And it is a solid Comfort to me to consider that how insignificant
            soever my Life was at the Revolution, it had still the good Fortune to make one among
            the many who brought it about; and that I now, with <pb n="67"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0162"/> my Co&aelig;vals, as well as with the Millions
            since born, enjoy the happy Effects of it.</p>
          <p>But I must now let you see how my particular Fortune went forward with this Change in
            the Government; of which I shall not pretend to give you any farther Account than what
            my simple Eyes saw of it.</p>
          <p>We had not been many Days at <hi rend="italic">Nottingham</hi> before we heard that the
            Prince of <hi rend="italic">Denmark</hi>, with some other great Persons, were gone off
            from the King to the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Orange</hi>, and that the Princess <hi
              rend="italic">Anne</hi>, fearing the King her Father's Resentment might fall upon her
            for her Consort's Revolt, had withdrawn her self in the Night from <hi rend="italic"
              >London</hi>, and was then within half a Days Journey of <hi rend="italic"
            >Nottingham;</hi> on which very Morning we were suddenly alarm'd with the News that two
            thousand of the King's Dragoons were in close pursuit to bring her back Prisoner to <hi
              rend="italic">London:</hi> But this Alarm it seems was all Stratagem, and was but a
            part of that general Terror which was thrown into many other Places about the Kingdom at
            the same time, with design to animate and unite the People in their common defence; it
            being then given out that the <hi rend="italic">Irish</hi> were every where at our Heels
            to cut off all the Protestants within the Reach of their Fury. In this Alarm our Troops
            scrambled to Arms in as much Order as their Consternation would admit of, when, having
            advanc'd some few Miles on the <hi rend="italic">London</hi> Road, they met the Princess
            in a Coach, attended only by the Lady <hi rend="italic">Churchill</hi> (now <pb n="68"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0163"/> Dutchess Dowager of <hi rend="italic">Marlborough</hi>)
            and the Lady <hi rend="italic">Fitzharding,</hi> whom they conducted into <hi
              rend="italic">Nottingham</hi> through the Acclamations of the People: The same Night
            all the Noblemen and the other Persons of Distinction then in Arms had the Honour to sup
            at her Royal Highness's Table; which was then furnish'd (as all her necessary
            Accommodations were) by the Care and at the Charge of the Lord <hi rend="italic"
              >Devonshire.</hi> At this Entertainment, of which I was a Spectator, something very
            particular surpriz'd me: The noble Guests at the Table happening to be more in number
            than Attendants out of Liveries could be found for, I being well known in the Lord <hi
              rend="italic">Devonshire</hi>'s Family, was desired by his Lordship's <hi
              rend="italic">Maitre d'Hotel</hi> to assist at it: The Post assign'd me was to observe
            what the Lady <hi rend="italic">Churchill</hi> might call for. Being so near the Table,
            you may naturally ask me what I might have heard to have pass'd in Conversation at it?
            which I should certainly tell you had I attended to above two Words that were utter'd
            there, and those were, <hi rend="italic">Some Wine and Water.</hi> These I remember came
            distinguish'd and observ'd to my Ear, because they came from the fair Guest whom I took
            such Pleasure to wait on: Except at that single Sound, all my Senses were collected into
            my Eyes, which during the whole Entertainment wanted no better Amusement, than of
            stealing now and then the Delight of gazing on the fair Object so near me: If so clear
            an Emanation of Beauty, such a commanding Grace of Aspect struck me into a Regard that
              <pb n="69" entity="DSSR_000002909_0164"/> had something softer than the most profound
            Respect in it, I cannot see why I may not without Offence remember it; since Beauty,
            like the Sun, must sometimes lose its Power to chuse, and shine into equal Warmth the
            Peasant and the Courtier. <ref target="n69-1" n="74">[69.1]</ref> Now to give you, Sir,
            a farther Proof of how good a Taste my first hopeful Entrance into Manhood set out with,
            I remember above twenty Years after, when the same Lady had given the World four of the
            loveliest Daughters that ever were gaz'd on, even after they were all nobly married, and
            were become the reigning Toasts of every Party of Pleasure, their still lovely Mother
            had at the same time her Votaries, and her Health very often took the Lead in those
            involuntary Triumphs of Beauty. However presumptuous or impertinent these Thoughts might
            have appear'd at my first entertaining them, why may I not hope that my having kept them
            decently secret for full fifty Years may be now a good round Pleas for their Pardon?
            Were I now qualify'd to say more of this celebrated Lady, I should conclude it thus:
            That she has liv'd (to all Appearance) a peculiar Favourite of Providence; that few
            Examples can parallel the Profusion of Blessings which have attended so long a Life of
            Felicity. A Person so <pb n="70" entity="DSSR_000002909_0165"/> attractive! a Husband so
            memorably great! an Offspring so beautiful! a Fortune so immense! and a Title which
            (when Royal Favour had no higher to bestow) she only could receive from the Author of
            Nature; a great Grandmother without grey Hairs! These are such consummate Indulgencies
            that we might think Heaven has center'd them all in one Person, to let us see how far,
            with a lively Understanding, the full Possession of them could contribute to human
            Happiness.&mdash;I now return to our Military Affairs.</p>
          <p>From <hi rend="italic">Nottingham</hi> our Troops march'd to <hi rend="italic"
            >Oxford;</hi> through every Town we pass'd the People came out, in some sort of Order,
            with such rural and rusty Weapons as they had, to meet us, in Acclamations of Welcome
            and good Wishes. This I thought promis'd a favourable End of our Civil War, when the
            Nation seem'd so willing to be all of a Side! At <hi rend="italic">Oxford</hi> the
            Prince and Princess of <hi rend="italic">Denmark</hi> met for the first time after their
            late Separation, and had all possible Honours paid them by the University. Here we
            rested in quiet Quarters for several Weeks, till the Flight of King <hi rend="italic"
              >James</hi> into <hi rend="italic">France;</hi> when the Nation being left to take
            care of it self, the only Security that could be found for it was to advance the Prince
            and Princess of <hi rend="italic">Orange</hi> to the vacant Throne. The publick
            Tranquillity being now settled, our Forces were remanded back to <hi rend="italic"
              >Nottingham.</hi> Here all our Officers who had commanded them from their first Rising
            receiv'd Commissions to confirm <pb n="71" entity="DSSR_000002909_0166"/> them in their
            several Posts; and at the same time such private Men as chose to return to their proper
            Business or Habitations were offer'd their Discharges. Among the small number of those
            who receiv'd them, I was one; for not hearing that my Name was in any of these new
            Commissions, I thought it time for me to take my leave of Ambition, as Ambition had
            before seduc'd me from the imaginary Honours of the Gown, and therefore resolv'd to hunt
            my Fortune in some other Field. <ref target="n71-1" n="75">[71.1]</ref>
          </p>
          <pb n="72" entity="DSSR_000002909_0167"/>
          <p>From <hi rend="italic">Nottingham</hi> I again return'd to my Father at <hi
              rend="italic">Chattsworth,</hi> where I staid till my Lord came down, with the new
            Honours <ref target="n72-1" n="76">[72.1]</ref> of Lord Steward of his Majesty's
            Houshold and Knight of the Garter! a noble turn of Fortune! and a deep Stake he had
            play'd for! which calls to my Memory a Story we had then in the Family, which though too
            light for our graver Historians notice, may be of weight enough for my humble Memoirs.
            This noble Lord being in the Presence-Chamber in King <hi rend="italic">James</hi>'s
            time, and known to be no Friend to the Measures of his Administration, a certain Person
            in favour there, and desirous to be more so, took occasion to tread rudely upon his
            Lordship's Foot, which was return'd with a sudden Blow upon the Spot: For this
            Misdemeanour his Lordship was fin'd thirty thousand Pounds; but I think had some time
            allow'd him for the Payment. <ref target="n72-2" n="77">[72.2]</ref> In the Summer
            preceding the Revolution, when his Lordship was retir'd to <hi rend="italic"
              >Chattsworth,</hi> and had been there deeply engag'd with other Noblemen in the
            Measures which soon after brought it to bear, King <hi rend="italic">James</hi> sent a
            Person down to him with Offers to mitigate his Fine upon Conditions of ready Payment, to
            which his Lordship reply'd, That if his Majesty pleas'd to allow him a little longer <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0168"/> time, he would rather chuse to play <hi rend="italic"
              >double</hi> or <hi rend="italic">quit</hi> with him: The time of the intended Rising
            being then so near at hand, the Demand, it seems, came too late for a more serious
            Answer.</p>
          <p>However low my Pretensions to Preferment were at this time, my Father thought that a
            little Court-Favour added to them might give him a Chance for saving the Expence of
            maintaining me, as he had intended, at the University: He therefore order'd me to draw
            up a Petition to the Duke, and, to give it some Air of Merit, to put it into <hi
              rend="italic">Latin</hi>, the Prayer of which was, That his Grace would be pleas'd to
            do something (I really forget what) for me.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;However the
            Duke, upon receiving it, was so good as to desire my Father would send me to <hi
              rend="italic">London</hi> in the Winter, where he would consider of some Provision for
            me. It might, indeed, well require time to consider it; for I believe it was then harder
            to know what I was really fit for, than to have got me any thing I was not fit for:
            However, to <hi rend="italic">London</hi> I came, where I enter'd into my first State of
            Attendance and Dependance for about five Months, till the <hi rend="italic"
            >February</hi> following. But alas! in my Intervals of Leisure, by frequently seeing
            Plays, my wise Head was turn'd to higher Views, I saw no Joy in any other Life than that
            of an Actor, so that (as before, when a Candidate at <hi rend="italic">Winchester</hi>)
            I was even afraid of succeeding to the Preferment I sought for: 'Twas on the Stage alone
            I had form'd a Happiness preferable to all that Camps or Courts could offer me! and <pb
              n="74" entity="DSSR_000002909_0169"/> there was I determin'd, let Father and Mother
            take it as they pleas'd, to fix my <hi rend="italic">non ultra.</hi>
            <ref target="n74-1" n="78">[74.1]</ref> Here I think my self oblig'd, in respect to the
            Honour of that noble Lord, to acknowledge that I believe his real Intentions to do well
            for me were prevented by my own inconsiderate Folly; so that if my Life did not then
            take a more laudable Turn, I have no one but my self to reproach for it; for I was
            credibly inform'd by the Gentlemen of his Houshold, that his Grace had, in their
            hearing, talk'd of recommending me to the Lord <hi rend="italic">Shrewsbury,</hi> then
            Secretary of State, for the first proper Vacancy in that Office. But the distant Hope of
            a Reversion was too cold a Temptation for a Spirit impatient as mine, that wanted
            immediate Possession of what my Heart was so differently set upon. The Allurements of a
            Theatre are still so strong in my Memory, that perhaps few, except those who have felt
            them, can conceive: And I am yet so far willing to excuse my Folly, that I am convinc'd,
            were it possible to take off that Disgrace and Prejudice which Custom has thrown upon
            the Profession of an Actor, many a well-born younger Brother and Beauty of low Fortune
            would gladly have adorn'd the Theatre, who by their not being able to brook such
            Dishonour to their Birth, have <pb n="75" entity="DSSR_000002909_0170"/> pass'd away
            their Lives decently unheeded and forgotten.</p>
          <p>Many Years ago, when I was first in the Menagement of the Theatre, I remember a strong
            Instance, which will shew you what degree of Ignominy the Profession of an Actor was
            then held at.&mdash;A Lady, with a real Title, whose female Indiscretions had
            occasion'd her Family to abandon her, being willing, in her Distress, to make an honest
            Penny of what Beauty she had left, desired to be admitted as an Actress; when before she
            could receive our Answer, a Gentleman (probably by her Relation's Permission) advis'd us
            not to entertain her, for Reasons easy to be guess'd. You may imagine we cou'd not be so
            blind to our Interest as to make an honourable Family our unnecessary Enemies by not
            taking his Advice; which the Lady, too, being sensible of, saw the Affair had its
            Difficulties, and therefore pursu'd it no farther. Now, is it not hard that it should be
            a doubt whether this Lady's Condition or ours were the more melancholy? For here you
            find her honest Endeavour to get Bread from the Stage was look'd upon as an Addition of
            new Scandal to her former Dishonour! so that I am afraid, according to this way of
            thinking, had the same Lady stoop'd to have sold Patches and Pomatum in a Band-box from
            Door to Door, she might in that Occupation have starv'd with less Infamy than had she
            reliev'd her Necessities by being famous on the Theatre. Whether this Prejudice may have
            arisen from the <pb n="76" entity="DSSR_000002909_0171"/> abuses that so often have
            crept in upon the Stage, I am not clear in; tho' when that is grossly the Case, I will
            allow there ought to be no Limits set to the Contempt of it; yet in its lowest Condition
            in my time, methinks there could have been no Pretence of preferring the Band-box to the
            Buskin. But this severe Opinion, whether merited or not, is not the greatest Distress
            that this Profession is liable to.</p>
          <p>I shall now give you another Anecdote, quite the reverse of what I have instanc'd,
            wherein you will see an Actress as hardly us'd for an Act of Modesty (which without
            being a Prude, a Woman, even upon the Stage, may sometimes think it necessary not to
            throw off.) This too I am forc'd to premise, that the Truth of what I am going to tell
            you may not be sneer'd at before it be known. About the Year 1717, a young Actress of a
            desirable Person, sitting in an upper Box at the Opera, a military Gentleman thought
            this a proper Opportunity to secure a little Conversation with her, the Particulars of
            which were probably no more worth repeating than it seems the <hi rend="italic"
              >Damoiselle</hi> then thought them worth listening to; for, notwithstanding the fine
            Things he said to her, she rather chose to give the Musick the Preference of her
            Attention: This Indifference was so offensive to his high Heart, that he began to change
            the Tender into the Terrible, and, in short, proceeded at last to treat her in a Style
            too grosly insulting for the meanest Female Ear to endure unresented: Upon which, being
            beaten too far out of her Discretion, <pb n="77" entity="DSSR_000002909_0172"/> she
            turn'd hastily upon him with an angry Look, and a Reply which seem'd to set his Merit in
            so low a Regard, that he thought himself oblig'd in Honour to take his time to resent
            it: This was the full Extent of her Crime, which his Glory delay'd no longer to punish
            than 'till the next time she was to appear upon the Stage: There, in one of her best
            Parts, wherein she drew a favourable Regard and Approbation from the Audience, he,
            dispensing with the Respect which some People think due to a polite Assembly, began to
            interrupt her Performance with such loud and various Notes of Mockery, as other young
            Men of Honour in the same Place have sometimes made themselves undauntedly merry with:
            Thus, deaf to all Murmurs or Entreaties of those about him, he pursued his Point, even
            to throwing near her such Trash as no Person can be suppos'd to carry about him unless
            to use on so particular an Occasion.</p>
          <p>A Gentleman then behind the Scenes, being shock'd at his unmanly Behaviour, was warm
            enough to say, That no Man but a Fool or a Bully cou'd be capable of insulting an
            Audience or a Woman in so monstrous a manner. The former valiant Gentleman, to whose Ear
            the Words were soon brought by his Spies, whom he had plac'd behind the Scenes to
            observe how the Action was taken there, came immediately from the Pit in a Heat, and
            demanded to know of the Author of those Words if he was the Person that spoke them? to
            which he calmly reply'd, <pb n="78" entity="DSSR_000002909_0173"/> That though he had
            never seen him before, yet, since he seem'd so earnest to be satisfy'd, he would do him
            the favour to own, That indeed the Words were his, and that they would be the last Words
            he should chuse to deny, whoever they might fall upon. To conclude, their Dispute was
            ended the next Morning in <hi rend="italic">Hyde-Park,</hi> where the determin'd
            Combatant who first ask'd for Satisfaction was oblig'd afterwards to ask his Life too;
            whether he mended it or not, I have not yet heard; but his Antagonist in a few Years
            after died in one of the principal Posts of the Government. <ref target="n78-1" n="79"

          <p>Now, though I have sometimes known these gallant Insulters of Audiences draw themselves
            into Scrapes which they have less honourably got out of, yet, alas! what has that
            avail'd? This generous publick-spirited Method of silencing a few was but repelling the
            Disease in one Part to make it break out in another: All Endeavours at Protection are
            new Provocations to those who pride themselves in pushing their Courage to a Defiance of
            Humanity. Even when a Royal Resentment has shewn itself in the behalf of an injur'd
            Actor, it has been unable to defend him from farther Insults! an Instance of which
            happen'd in the late King <hi rend="italic">James</hi>'s time. Mr. <hi rend="italic"
              >Smith</hi>
            <ref target="n78-2" n="80">[78.2]</ref> (whose Character as a Gentleman could have <pb
              n="79" entity="DSSR_000002909_0174"/> been no way impeach'd had he not degraded it by
            being a celebrated Actor) had the Misfortune, in a Dispute with a Gentleman behind the
            Scenes, to receive a Blow from him: The same Night an Account of this Action was carry'd
            to the King, to whom the Gentleman was represented to grosly in the wrong, that the next
            Day his Majesty sent to forbid him the Court upon it. This Indignity cast upon a
            Gentleman only for having maltreated a Player, was look'd upon as the Concern of every
            Gentleman; and a Party was soon form'd to assert and vindicate their Honour, by humbling
            this favour'd Actor, whose slight Injury had been judg'd equal to so severe a Notice.
            Accordingly, the next time <hi rend="italic">Smith</hi> acted he was receiv'd with a
            Chorus of Cat-calls, that soon convinc'd him he should not be suffer'd to proceed in his
            Part; upon which, without the least Discomposure, he order'd the Curtain to be dropp'd;
            and, having a competent Fortune of his own, thought the Conditions of adding to it by
            his remaining upon the Stage were too dear, and from that Day entirely quitted it. <ref
              target="n79-1" n="81">[79.1]</ref> I shall make no Observation upon the King's
            Resentment, or on that of his good Subjects; how far either was or was not right, is not
            the Point I dispute for: Be that as it may, the unhappy Condition of the Actor was so
            far from being reliev'd by this Royal Interposition in his favour, that it was the worse
            for it.</p>
          <p>While these sort of real Distresses on the Stage <pb n="80"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0175"/> are so unavoidable, it is no wonder that young People
            of Sense (though of low Fortune) should be so rarely found to supply a Succession of
            good Actors. Why then may we not, in some measure, impute the Scarcity of them to the
            wanton Inhumanity of those Spectators, who have made it so terribly mean to appear
            there? Were there no ground for this Question, where could be the Disgrace of entring
            into a Society whose Institution, when not abus'd, is a delightful School of Morality;
            and where to excel requires as ample Endowments of Nature as any one Profession (that of
            holy Institution excepted) whatsoever? But, alas! as <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi>
            says,</p>
          <lg type="verse">

          <p>Look into St. <hi rend="italic">Peter</hi>'s at <hi rend="italic">Rome,</hi> and see
            what a profitable Farce is made of Religion there! Why then is an Actor more blemish'd
            than a Cardinal? While the Excellence of the one arises from his innocently seeming what
            he is not, and the Eminence of the other from the most impious Fallacies that can be
            impos'd upon human Understanding? If the best things, therefore, are most liable to
            Corruption, the Corruption of the Theatre is no Disproof of its innate and primitive
            Utility.</p>
          <p>In this Light, therefore, all the Abuses of the Stage, all the low, loose, or immoral
            Supplements to <pb n="81" entity="DSSR_000002909_0176"/> wit, whether in making Virtue
            ridiculous or Vice agreeable, or in the decorated Nonsense and Absurdities of
            Pantomimical Trumpery, I give up to the Contempt of every sensible Spectator, as so much
            rank Theatrical Popery. But cannot still allow these Enormities to impeach the
            Profession, while they are so palpably owing to the deprav'd Taste of the Multitude.
            While Vice and Farcical Folly are the most profitable Commodities, why should we wonder
            that, time out of mind, the poor Comedian, when real Wit would bear no Price, should
            deal in what would bring him most ready Money? But this, you will say, is making the
            Stage a Nursery of Vice and Folly, or at least keeping an open Shop for
            it.&mdash;&mdash; I grant it: But who do you expect should reform it? The
            Actors? Why so? If People are permitted to buy it without blushing, the Theatrical
            Merchant seems to have an equal Right to the Liberty of selling it without Reproach.
            That this Evil wants a Remedy is not to be contested; nor can it be denied that the
            Theatre is as capable of being preserv'd by a Reformation as Matters of more Importance;
            which, for the Honour of our National Taste, I could wish were attempted; and then, if
            it could not subsist under decent Regulations, by not being permitted to present any
            thing there but what were <hi rend="italic">worthy</hi> to be there, it would be time
            enough to consider, whether it were necessary to let it totally fall, or effectually
            support it.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding all my best Endeavours to recommend <pb n="82"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0177"/> the Profession of an Actor to a more general Favour, I
            doubt, while it is liable to such Corruptions, and the Actor himself to such unlimited
            Insults as I have already mention'd, I doubt, I say, we must still leave him a-drift,
            with his intrinsick Merit, to ride out the Storm as well as he is able.</p>
          <p>However, let us now turn to the other side of this Account, and see what Advantages
            stand there to balance the Misfortunes I have laid before you. There we shall still find
            some valuable Articles of Credit, that sometimes overpay his incidental Disgraces.</p>
          <p>First, if he has Sense, he will consider that as these Indignities are seldom or never
            offer'd him by People that are remarkable for any one good Quality, he ought not to lay
            them too close to his Heart: He will know too, that when Malice, Envy, or a brutal
            Nature, can securely hide or fence themselves in a Multitude, Virtue, Merit, Innocence,
            and even sovereign Superiority, have been, and must be equally liable to their Insults;
            that therefore, when they fall upon him in the same manner, his intrinsick Value cannot
            be diminish'd by them: On the contrary, if, with a decent and unruffled Temper, he lets
            them pass, the Disgrace will return upon his Aggressor, and perhaps warm the generous
            Spectator into a Partiality in his Favour.</p>
          <p>That while he is conscious, That, as an Actor, he must be always in the Hands of
            Injustice, it does him at least this involuntary Good, that it keeps him in a settled
            Resolution to avoid all Occasions of provoking it, or of even offending the lowest
            Enemy, <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0178"/> who, at the Expence of a Shilling, may
            publickly revenge it.</p>
          <p>That, if he excells on the Stage, and is irreproachable in his Personal Morals and
            Behaviour, his Profession is so far from being an Impediment, that it will be oftner a
            just Reason for his being receiv'd among People of condition with Favour; and sometimes
            with a more social Distinction, than the best, though more profitable Trade he might
            have follow'd, could have recommended him to.</p>
          <p>That this is a Happiness to which several Actors within my Memory, as <hi rend="italic"
              >Betterton, Smith, Montfort,</hi> Captain <hi rend="italic">Griffin,</hi>
            <ref target="n83-1" n="83">[83.1]</ref> and Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Bracegirdle</hi> (yet
            living) have arriv'd at; to which I may add the late celebrated <pb n="84"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0179"/> Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield.</hi> Now let us
            suppose these Persons, the Men, for example, to have been all eminent Mercers, and the
            Women as famous Milliners, can we imagine that merely as such, though endow'd with the
            same natural Understanding, they could have been call'd into the same honourable Parties
            of Conversation? People of Sense and Condition could not but know it was impossible they
            could have had such various Excellencies on the Stage, without having something
            naturally valuable in them: And I will take upon me to affirm, who knew them all living,
            that there was not one of the Number who were not capable of supporting a variety of
            Spirited Conversation, tho' the Stage were never to have been the Subject of it.</p>
          <p>That to have trod the Stage has not always been thought a Disqualification from more
            honourable Employments; several have had military Commissions; <hi rend="italic"
              >Carlisle</hi>
            <ref target="n84-1" n="84">[84.1]</ref> and <hi rend="italic">Wiltshire</hi><ref
              target="n84-2" n="85">[84.2]</ref> were both kill'd Captains; <pb n="85"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0180"/> one in King <hi rend="italic">William</hi>'s Reduction
            of <hi rend="italic">Ireland;</hi> and the other in his first War in <hi rend="italic"
              >Flanders;</hi> and the famous <hi rend="italic">Ben. Johnson,</hi> tho' an
            unsuccessful Actor, was afterwards made Poet-Laureat. <ref target="n85-1" n="86"
            >[85.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>To these laudable Distinctions let me add one more; that of Publick Applause, which,
            when truly merited, is perhaps one of the most agreeable Gratifications that venial
            Vanity can feel. A Happiness almost peculiar to the Actor, insomuch that the best
            Tragick Writer, however numerous his separate Admirers may be, yet, to unite them into
            one general Act of Praise, to receive at once those thundring Peals of Approbation which
            a crouded Theatre throws out, he must still call in the Assistance of the skilful Actor
            to raise and partake of them.</p>
          <p>In a Word, 'twas in this flattering Light only, though not perhaps so thoroughly
            consider'd, I look'd upon the Life of an Actor when but eighteen Years of Age; nor can
            you wonder if the Temptations were too strong for so warm a Vanity as mine to resist;
            but whether excusable or not, to the Stage at length I came, and it is from thence,
            chiefly, your Curiosity, if you have any left, is to expect a farther Account of me.</p>

            <p> Bellchambers finds in this sentence "a levity, which accords with the charges so
              often brought against Cibber of impiety and irreligion;" and he quotes from Davies
              ("Dram. Misc.," iii. 506) two stories&mdash;one, that Cibber spat at a picture of
              our Saviour; and the other, that he endeavoured to enter into discussion with "honest
              Mr. William Whiston" with the intention of insulting him. Both anecdotes seem to me
              rather foolish. I do not suppose Cibber was in any sense a religious man, but his
              works are far from giving any offence to religion; and, as a paid supporter of a
              Protestant succession, I think he was too prudent to be an open scoffer. A sentence in
              one of Victor's "Letters" (i. 72), written from Tunbridge, would seem to show that
              Cibber at least preserved appearances. He says, "Every one complies with what is

            <p> By the kindness of a friend at Cambridge I am enabled to give the following
              interesting extracts from a letter written by Mr. William White, of Trinity College
              Library, regarding the statues here referred to: " They occupy the four piers,
              subdividing the balustrade on the east side of the Library, overlooking Neville's
              Court. The four Statues represent Divinity, Law, Physic, and Mathematics. That these
              were executed by Mr. Gabriel Cibber our books will prove. I will give you two or three
              extracts from Grumbold's Account Book, kept in the Library. He was Foreman of the
              Works when the Library was built. I think Cibber cut the Statues here. It is quite
              certain he and his men were here some time: no doubt they superintended the placing of
              them in their positions, at so great a height.</p>

            <p> One of the commonest imputations made against Cibber was that he was of a cowardly
              temper. In "Common Sense" for 11th June, 1737, a paper attributed to Lord
              Chesterfield, there is a dissertation on kicking as a humorous incident on the stage.
              The writer adds: "Of all the Comedians who have appeared upon the Stage within my
              Memory, no one has taking (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) a Kicking with so much Humour
              as our present most excellent Laureat, and I am inform'd his Son does not fall much
              short of him in this excellence; I am very glad of it, for as I have a Kindness for
              the young Man, I hope to see him as well kick'd as his Father was before him."</p>
            <p>I confess that I am not quite sure how far this sentence is ironically meant, but
              Bellchambers refers to it as conveying a serious accusation of cowardice. He also
              quotes from Davies ("Dram. Misc.," iii. 487), who relates, on the authority of Victor,
              that Cibber, having reduced Bickerstaffe's salary by one-half, was waited upon by that
              actor, who "flatly told him, that as he could not subsist on the small sum to which he
              had reduced his salary, he must call the author of his distress to an account, for
              that it would be easier for him to lose his life than to starve. The affrighted Cibber
              told him, he should receive an answer from him on Saturday next. Bickerstaffe found,
              on that day, his usual income was continued." This story rests only on Victor's
              authority, but is, of course, not improbable. There is also a vague report that Gay,
              in revenge for Cibber's banter of "Three Hours after Marriage," personally chastised
              him, but I know no good authority for the story.</p>

            <p> Captain Griffin was, no doubt, the Griffin who is mentioned by Downes as entering
              the King's Company "after they had begun at Drury Lane." This is of course very
              indefinite as regards time. Drury Lane was opened in 1663, but the first character for
              which we can find Griffin's name mentioned, is that of Varnish in "The Plain-Dealer,"
              which was produced in 1674. At the Union in 1682, Griffin took a good position in the
              amalgamated company, and continued on the stage till about 1688, when his name
              disappears from the bills. During this time he is not called <hi rend="italic"
              >Captain</hi>, but in 1701 the name of Captain Griffin appears among the Drury Lane
              actors. Genest says it is more probable that this should be Griffin returned to the
              stage after thirteen years spent in the army, than that Captain Griffin should have
              gone on the stage without having previously been connected with it. In this Genest is
              quite correct, for the anecdote of Goodman and Griffin, which Cibber tells in Chap.
              XII. shows conclusively that <hi rend="italic">Captain</hi> Griffin was an actor
              during Goodman's stage-career, which ended certainly before 1690. He appears to have
              finally retired about the beginning of 1708. Downes says <hi rend="italic">"Mr.</hi>
              Griffin <hi rend="italic">so Excell'd in</hi> Surly. Sir Edward Belfond, <hi
                rend="italic">The</hi> Plain Dealer, <hi rend="italic">none succeeding in the 2

              supply the two words "nor any" to make clear what Downes must have meant.</p>

            <p> The "Biographia Dramatica" (i. 87) gives an account of James Carlile. He was a
              native of Lancashire, and in his youth was an actor; but he left the stage for the
              army, and was killed at the battle of Aughrim, 11th July, 1691. Nothing practically is
              known of his stage career. Downes (p. 39) notes that at the Union of the Patents in
              1682, "Mr. <hi rend="italic">Montfort</hi> and Mr. <hi rend="italic">Carlile,</hi>
              were grown to the Maturity of good <hi rend="italic">Actors."</hi> I cannot trace

            in which, among numbers, I was involv'd. And as the one will lead you into a clearer
            View of the other, it may therefore be previously necessary to let you know that</p>

            <ref target="n88-2" n="90">[88.2]</ref> About ten of the King's Company were on the

            <pb n="89" entity="DSSR_000002909_0188"/> Delight and Concern of the Court, that they
            were not only supported by its being frequently present at their publick <hi
              rend="italic">Presentations,</hi> but by its taking cognizance even of their private
            Government, insomuch that their particular Differences, Pretentions, or Complaints were
            generally ended by the <hi rend="italic">King</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Duke's</hi>
            Personal Command or Decision. Besides their being thorough Masters of their Art, these
            Actors set forwards with two critical Advantages, which perhaps may never happen again
            in many Ages. The one was, their immediate opening after the so long Interdiction of
            Plays during the Civil War and the Anarchy that followed it. What eager Appetites from
            so long a Fast must the Guests of those Times have had to that high and fresh variety of
            Entertainments which <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> had left prepared for them? Never
            was a Stage so provided! A hundred Years are wasted, and another silent Century well
            advanced, and yet what unborn Age shall say <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> had his
            equal! How many shining Actors have the warm Scenes of his Genius given to Posterity?
            without being himself in his Action equal to his Writing! A strong Proof that Actors,
            like Poets, must be born such. Eloquence and Elocution are quite different Talents: <hi
              rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> could write <hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> but Tradition
            tells us That the <hi rend="italic">Ghost,</hi> in the same Play, was one of his best
            Performances as an Actor: Nor is it within the reach of Rule or Precept to complete
            either of them. Instruction, 'tis true, may guard them equally against Faults or
            Absurdities, <pb n="90" entity="DSSR_000002909_0189"/> but there it stops; Nature must
            do the rest: To excel in either Art is a self-born Happiness which something more than
            good Sense must be the Mother of.</p>
          <p>The other Advantage I was speaking of is, that before the Restoration no Actress had
            ever been seen upon the <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Stage. <ref target="n90-1" n="92"
              >[90.1]</ref> The Characters of Women on former Theatres were perform'd by Boys, or
            young Men of the most effeminate Aspect. And what Grace or Master-strokes of Action can
            we conceive such ungain Hoydens to have been capable of? This Defect was so well
            considered by <hi rend="italic">Shakespear,</hi> that in few of his Plays he has any
            greater Dependance upon the Ladies than in the Innocence and Simplicity of a <hi
              rend="italic">Desdemona</hi>, an <hi rend="italic">Ophelia,</hi> or in the short
            Specimen of a fond and virtuous <hi rend="italic">Portia</hi>. The additional Objects
            then of real, beautiful Women <pb n="91" entity="DSSR_000002909_0190"/> could not but
            draw a Proportion of new Admirers to the Theatre. We may imagine, too, that these
            Actresses were not ill chosen, when it is well known that more than one of them had
            Charms sufficient at their leisure Hours to calm and mollify the Cares of Empire. <ref
              target="n91-1" n="93">[91.1]</ref> Besides these peculiar Advantages, they had a
            private Rule or Agreement, which both Houses were happily ty'd down to, which was, that
            no Play acted at one House should ever be attempted at the other. All the capital Plays
            therefore of <hi rend="italic">Shakespear, Fletcher,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ben.
              Johnson</hi> were divided between them by the Approbation of the Court and their own
            alternate Choice. <ref target="n91-2" n="94">[91.2]</ref> So that when <hi rend="italic"
              >Hart</hi>
            <ref target="n91-3" n="95">[91.3]</ref> was famous for <hi rend="italic">Othello,
              Betterton</hi> had n less a Reputation for <hi rend="italic">Hamlet.</hi> By this
            Order the Stage was supply'd with a greater Variety of Plays than could possibly have
            been shewn had both Companies been employ'd at the same time upon the same Play; which
            Liberty, too, must have occasion'd such frequent Repetitions of 'em, by their opposite
            Endeavours to forestall and anticipate one another, that the best Actors in the World
            must have grown tedious and tasteless to the Spectator: For what Pleasure is not languid
            to Satiety? <ref target="n91-4" n="96">[91.4]</ref> It was therefore one of our <pb
              n="92" entity="DSSR_000002909_0191"/> greatest Happinesses (during my time of being in
            the Menagement of the Stage) that we had a certain Number of select Plays which no other
            Company had the good Fortune to make a tolerable Figure in, and consequently could find
            little or no Account by acting them against us. These Plays therefore for many Years, by
            not being too often seen, never fail'd to bring us crowded Audiences; and it was to this
            Conduct we ow'd no little Share of our Prosperity. But when four Houses <ref
              target="n92-1" n="97">[92.1]</ref> are at once (as very lately they were) all
            permitted to act the same Pieces, let three of them perform never so ill, when Plays
            come to be so harrass'd and hackney'd out to the common People (half of which too,
            perhaps, would as lieve see them at one House as another) the best Actors will soon feel
            that the Town has enough of them.</p>
          <p>I know it is the common Opinion, That the more Play-houses the more Emulation; I grant
            it; but what has this Emulation ended in? Why, a daily <pb n="93"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0192"/> Contention which shall soonest surfeit you with the
            best Plays; so that when what <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to please can no <hi
              rend="italic">longer</hi> please, your Appetite is again to be raised by such
            monstrous Presentations as dishonour the Taste of a civiliz'd People. <ref
              target="n93-1" n="98">[93.1]</ref> If, indeed, to our several Theatres we could raise
            a proportionable Number of good Authors to give them all different Employment, then
            perhaps the Publick might profit from their Emulation: But while good Writers are so
            scarce, and undaunted Criticks so plenty, I am afraid a good Play and a blazing Star
            will be equal Rarities. This voluptuous Expedient, therefore, of indulging the Taste
            with several Theatres, will amount to much the same variety as that of a certain
            Oeconomist, who, to enlarge his Hospitality, would have two Puddings and two Legs of
            Mutton for the same Dinner. <ref target="n93-2" n="99">[93.2]</ref> &mdash;But to
            resume the Thread of my History.</p>
          <p>These two excellent Companies were both prosperous for some few Years, 'till their
            Variety of Plays began to be exhausted: Then of course the better Actors (which the
            King's seem to have been <pb n="94" entity="DSSR_000002909_0193"/> allowed) could not
            fail of drawing the greater Audiences. Sir <hi rend="italic">William Davenant,</hi>
            therefore, Master of the Duke's Company, to make Head against their Success, was forced
            to add Spectacle and Musick to Action; and to introduce a new Species of Plays, since
            call'd Dramatick Opera's, of which kind were the <hi rend="italic">Tempest, Psyche,
              Circe,</hi> and others, all set off with the most expensive Decorations of Scenes and
            Habits, with the best Voices and Dangers. <ref target="n94-1" n="100">[94.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>This sensual Supply of Sight and Sound coming in to the Assistance of the weaker Party,
            it was no Wonder they should grow too hard for Sense and simple Nature, when it is
            consider'd how many more People there are, that can see and hear, than think and judge.
            So wanton a Change of the publick Taste, therefore, began to fall as heavy upon the
            King's Company as their greater Excellence in Action had before fallen upon their
            Competitors: Of which Encroachment upon Wit several good Prologues in those Days
            frequently complain'd. <ref target="n94-2" n="101">[94.2]</ref>
          </p>

          <pb n="95" entity="DSSR_000002909_0194"/>
          <p>But alas! what can Truth avail, when its Dependance is much more upon the Ignorant than
            the sensible Auditor? a poor Satisfaction, that the due Praise given to it must at last
            sink into the cold Comfort of&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Laudatur &amp; Alget.</hi>
            <ref target="n95-1" n="102">[95.1]</ref> Unprofitable Praise can hardly give it a <hi
              rend="italic">Soup maigre.</hi> Taste and Fashion with us have always had Wings, and
            fly from on publick Spectacle to another so wantonly, that I have been inform'd by those
            who remember it, that a famous Puppet-shew <ref target="n95-2" n="103">[95.2]</ref> in
              <hi rend="italic">Salisbury</hi> Change (then standing where <hi rend="italic"
              >Cecil-Street</hi> now is) so far distrest these two celebrated Companies, that they
            were reduced to petition the King for Relief against it: Nor ought we perhaps to think
            this strange, when, if I mistake not, <hi rend="italic">Terence</hi> himself reproaches
            the <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi> Auditors of his Time with the like Fondness for the <hi
              rend="italic">Funambuli,</hi> the Rope-dancers. <ref target="n95-3" n="104"
            >[95.3]</ref> Not to dwell too long therefore upon that Part of my History which I have
            only collected from oral Tradition, I <pb n="96" entity="DSSR_000002909_0195"/> shall
            content myself with telling you that <hi rend="italic">Mohun</hi>
            <ref target="n96-1" n="105">[96.1]</ref> and <hi rend="italic">Hart</hi> now growing old
            (for, above thirty Years before this Time, they had severally born the King's Commission
            of Major and Captain in the Civil Wars), and the younger Actors, as <hi rend="italic"
              >Goodman,</hi>
            <ref target="n96-2" n="106">[96.2]</ref>
            <hi rend="italic">Clark,</hi>
            <ref target="n96-3" n="107">[96.3]</ref> and others, being impatient to get into their
            Parts, and growing intractable, <ref target="n96-4" n="108">[96.4]</ref> the Audiences
            too of both Houses then falling off, the Patentees of each, by the King's Advice, which
            perhaps amounted to a Command, united their Interests and both Companies into one,
            exclusive of all others, in the Year 1682. <ref target="n96-5" n="109">[96.5]</ref> This
            Union was, however, so much in favour of the Duke's Company, that <hi rend="italic"
            >Hart</hi> left the Stage upon it, and <hi rend="italic">Mohun</hi> survived not long
            after.</p>
          <p>One only Theatre being now in Possession of the whole Town, the united Patentees
            imposed their own <pb n="97" entity="DSSR_000002909_0196"/> Terms upon the Actors; for
            the Profits of acting were then divided into twenty Shares, ten of which went to the
            Proprietors, and the other Moiety to the principal Actors, in such Sub-divisions as
            their different Merit might pretend to. These Shares of the Patentees were promiscuously
            sold out to Money-making Persons, call'd Adventurers, <ref target="n97-1" n="110"
            >[97.1]</ref> who, tho' utterly ignorant of Theatrical Affairs, were still admitted to a
            proportionate Vote in the Menagement of them; in particular Encouragements to Actors
            were by them, of Consequence, look'd upon as so many Sums deducted from their private
            Dividends. While therefore the Theatrical Hive had so many Drones in it, the labouring
            Actors, sure, were under the highest Discouragement, if not a direct State of
            Oppression. Their Hardship will at least appear in a much stronger Light when compar'd
            to our later Situation, who with scarce half their Merit succeeded to be Sharers under a
            Patent upon five times easier Conditions: For as they had but half the Profits divided
            among ten or more of them; we had three fourths of the whole Profits divided only among
            three of us: And as they might be said to have ten Task-masters over them, we never had
            but one Assistant Menager (not an Actor) join'd with us; <ref target="n97-2" n="111"
              >[97.2]</ref> who, by the <pb n="98" entity="DSSR_000002909_0197"/> Crown's
            Indulgence, was sometimes too of our own chusing. Under this heavy Establishment then
            groan'd this United Company when I was first admitted into the lowest Rank of it. How
            they came to be relieved by King <hi rend="italic">William</hi>'s Licence in 1695, how
            they were again dispersed early in Queen <hi rend="italic">Anne</hi>'s Reign, and from
            what Accidents Fortune took better care of Us, their unequal Successors, will be told in
            its Place: But to prepare you for the opening so large a Scene of their History,
            methinks I ought (in Justice to their Memory too) to give you such particular Characters
            of their Theatrical Merit as in my plain Judgment they seem'd to deserve. Presuming then
            that this Attempt may not be disagreeable to the Curious or the true Lovers of the
            Theatre, take it without farther Preface.</p>
          <p>In the Year 1690, when I first came into this Company, the principal Actors then at the
            Head of it were, Of Men. Of Women. Mr. <hi rend="italic">Betterton,</hi> Mrs. <hi
              rend="italic">Betterton,</hi> Mr. <hi rend="italic">Monfort,</hi> Mrs. <hi

              >Leigh,</hi> Mr. <hi rend="italic">Sandford,</hi> Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Butler,</hi>
            Mr. <hi rend="italic">Nokes,</hi> Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Monfort,</hi> and Mr. <hi
              rend="italic">Underhil,</hi> and Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Bracegirdle.</hi> Mr. <hi
              rend="italic">Leigh.</hi></p>
          <p>These Actors whom I have selected from their <pb n="99" entity="DSSR_000002909_0198"/>
            Cotemporaries were all original Masters in their different Stile, not meer auricular
            Imitators of one another, which commonly is the highest Merit of the middle Rank, but
            Self-judges of Nature, from whose various Lights they only took their true Instruction.
            If in the following Account of them I may be obliged to hint at the Faults of others, I
            never mean such Observations should extend to those who are now in Possession of the
            Stage; for as I design not my Memoirs shall come down to their Time, I would not lie
            under the Imputation of speaking in their Disfavour to the Publick, whose Approbation
            they must depend upon for Support. <ref target="n99-1" n="112">[99.1]</ref> But to my
            Purpose.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi> was an Actor, as <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> was
            an Author, both without Competitors! form'd for the mutual Assistance and Illustration
            of each others Genius! How <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> wrote, all Men who have a
            Taste for Nature may read and know&mdash;but with what higher Rapture would he still
            be <hi rend="italic">read</hi> could they conceive how <hi rend="italic">Betterton
              play'd</hi> him! Then might they know the one was born alone to speak what the other
            only knew to write! Pity it is that the momentary Beauties flowing from an harmonious
            Elocution cannot, like those of Poetry, be their own Record! That the animated Graces of
            the Player can live no longer than the instant Breath and <pb n="100"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0199"/> Motion that presents them, or at best can but faintly
            glimmer through the Memory or imperfect Attestation of a few surviving Spectators. Could
              <hi rend="italic">how Betterton</hi> spoke be as easily known as <hi rend="italic"
              >what</hi> he spoke, then might you see the Muse of <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi>
            in her Triumph, with all her Beauties in their best Array rising into real Life and
            charming her Beholders. But alas! since all this is so far out of the reach of
            Description, how shall I shew you <hi rend="italic">Betterton?</hi> Should I therefore
            tell you that all the <hi rend="italic">Othellos, Hamlets, Hotspurs, Mackbeths,</hi> and
              <hi rend="italic">Brutus</hi>'s whom you may have seen since his Time, have fallen far
            short of him; this still would give you no Idea of his particular Excellence. Let us see
            then what a particular Comparison may do! whether that may yet draw him nearer to you?</p>
          <p>You have seen a <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> perhaps, who, on the first Appearance of
            his Father's Spirit, has thrown himself into all the straining Vociferation requisite to
            express Rage and Fury, and the House has thunder'd with Applause; tho' the mis-guided
            Actor was all the while (as <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> terms it) tearing a
            Passion into Rags <ref target="n100-1" n="113">[100.1]</ref> &mdash;I am the more
            bold to offer you this particular Instance, because the late Mr. <hi rend="italic"
              >Addison,</hi> while I sate by him to see this Scene acted, made <pb n="101"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0200"/> the same Observation, asking me, with some Surprize, if
            I thought <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> should be in so violent a Passion with the
            Ghost, which, tho' it might have astonish'd, it had not provok'd him? for you may
            observe that in this beautiful Speech the Passion never rises beyond an almost
            breathless Astonishment, or an Impatience, limited by filial Reverence, to enquire into
            the suspected Wrongs that may have rais'd him from his peaceful Tomb! and a Desire to
            know what a Spirit so seemingly distrest might wish or enjoin a sorrowful Son to execute
            towards his future Quiet in the Grave? This was the Light into which <hi rend="italic"
              >Betterton</hi> threw this Scene; which he open'd with a Pause of mute Amazement! then
            rising slowly to a solemn, trembling Voice, he made the Ghost equally terrible to the
            Spectator as to himself! <ref target="n101-1" n="114">[101.1]</ref> and in the
            descriptive Part of the natural Emotions which the ghastly Vision gave him, the boldness
            of his Expostulation was still govern'd by Decency, manly, but not braving; his Voice
            never rising into that seeming Outrage or wild Defiance of what he naturally rever'd.
              <ref target="n101-2" n="115">[101.2]</ref> But alas! to preserve this medium, between
            mouthing <pb n="102" entity="DSSR_000002909_0201"/> and meaning too little, to keep the
            Attention more pleasingly awake by a temper'd Spirit than by meer Vehemence of Voice, is
            of all the Master-strokes of an Actor the most difficult to reach. In this none yet have
            equall'd <hi rend="italic">Betterton.</hi> But I am unwilling to shew his Superiority
            only by recounting the Errors of those who now cannot answer to them, let their farther
            Failings therefore be forgotten! or rather, shall I in some measure excuse them? For I
            am not yet sure that they might not be as much owing to the false Judgment of the
            Spectator as the Actor. While the Million are so apt to be transported when the Drum of
            their Ear is so roundly rattled; while they take the Life of Elocution to lie in the
            Strength of the Lungs, it is no wonder the Actor, whose end is Applause, should be also
            tempted at this easy rate to excite it. Shall I go a little farther? and allow that this
            Extreme is more pardonable than its opposite Error? I mean that dangerous Affectation of
            the Monotone, or solemn Sameness of Pronounciation, which, to my Ear, is insupportable;
            for of all Faults that so frequently pass upon the Vulgar, that of Flatness will have
            the fewest Admirers. That this is an Error of ancient standing seems evident by what <hi
              rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> says, in his Instructions to the Players, <hi rend="italic"
              >viz.</hi>
            <q><hi rend="italic">Be not too tame, neither,</hi> &amp;c.</q> The Actor,
            doubtless, is as strongly ty'd down to the Rules of <hi rend="italic">Horace</hi> as the
            Writer.</p>
          <pb n="103" entity="DSSR_000002909_0202"/>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>

          <p>He that feels not himself the Passion he would raise, will talk to a sleeping Audience:
            But this never was the Fault of <hi rend="italic">Betterton;</hi> and it has often
            amaz'd me to see those who soon came after him throw out, in some Parts of a Character,
            a just and graceful Spirit which <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi> himself could not but
            have applauded. And yet in the equally shining Passages of the same Character have
            heavily dragg'd the Sentiment along like a dead Weight, with a long-ton'd Voice and
            absent Eye, as if they had fairly forgot what they were about: If you have never made
            this Observation, I am contented you should not know where to apply it. <ref
              target="n103-2" n="117">[103.2]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>A farther Excellence in <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi> was, that he could vary his
            Spirit to the different Characters he acted. Those wild impatient Starts, that fierce
            and flashing Fire, which he threw into <hi rend="italic">Hotspur,</hi> never came from
            the unruffled Temper of his <hi rend="italic">Brutus</hi> (for I have more than once
            seen a <hi rend="italic">Brutus</hi> as warm as <hi rend="italic">Hotspur</hi>): when
            the <hi rend="italic">Betterton Brutus</hi> was provok'd in his Dispute with <hi
              rend="italic">Cassius,</hi> his Spirit flew only to his Eye; his steady Look alone
            supply'd that Terror <pb n="104" entity="DSSR_000002909_0203"/> which he disdain'd an
            Intemperance in his Voice should rise to. Thus, with a settled Dignity of Contempt, like
            an unheeding Rock he repelled upon himself the Foam of <hi rend="italic">Cassius.</hi>
            Perhaps they very Words of <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> will better let you into my
            Meaning:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>
              <hi rend="italic">Must I give way and room to your rash Choler?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
              <hi rend="italic">Shall I be frighted when a Madman stares?</hi>
            </l>
          </lg>
          <p>And a little after,</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l><hi rend="italic">There is no Terror,</hi> Cassius, <hi rend="italic">in your
              Looks!</hi> &amp;c.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>Not but in some part of this Scene, where he reproaches <hi rend="italic">Cassius,</hi>
            his Temper is not under this Suppression, but opens into that Warmth which becomes a Man
            of Virtue; yet this is that <hi rend="italic">Hasty Spark</hi> of Anger which <hi
              rend="italic">Brutus</hi> himself endeavours to excuse.</p>
          <p>But with whatever strength of Nature we see the Poet shew at once the Philosopher and
            the Heroe, yet the Image of the Actor's Excellence will be still imperfect to you unless
            Language could put Colours in our Words to paint the Voice with.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Et, si vis similem pingere, pinge sonum,</hi>
            <ref target="n104-1" n="118">[104.1]</ref> is enjoyning an impossibility. The most that
            a <hi rend="italic">Vandyke</hi> can arrive at, is to make his Portraits of great
            Persons seem to <hi rend="italic">think;</hi> a <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> goes
            farther yet, and tells you <hi rend="italic">what</hi> his Pictures thought; a <hi
              rend="italic">Betterton</hi> steps beyond 'em both, and calls them from the Grave to
            breathe and be themselves again in Feature, Speech, <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0204"/>

            <pb n="105" entity="DSSR_000002909_0208"/> and Motion. When the skilful Actor shews you
            all these Powers at once united, and gratifies at once your Eye, your Ear, your
            Understanding: To conceive the Pleasure rising from such Harmony, you must have been
            present at it! 'tis not to be told you!</p>
          <p>There cannot bed a stronger Proof of the Charms of harmonious Elocution than the many
            even unnatural Scenes and Flights of the False Sublime it has lifted into Applause. In
            what Raptures have I seen an Audience at the furious Fustian and turgid Rants in <hi

          <p>When these flowing Numbers came from the Mouth of a <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi>
            the Multitude no more desired Sense to them than our musical <hi rend="italic"
              >Connoisseurs</hi> think it essential in the celebrate Airs of an <hi rend="italic"
              >Italian</hi> Opera. Does not this prove that there is very near as much Enchantment
            in the well-govern'd Voice of an Actor as in the sweet Pipe of an Eunuch? If I tell you
            there was no one Tragedy, for many Years, more in favour with the Town than <hi
              rend="italic">Alexander,</hi> to what must we impute this its command of publick
            Admiration? Not to its intrinsick Merit, surely, if it swarms with passages like this I
            have shewn you! If this Passage has Merit, let us see what Figure it would make upon
            Canvas, what sort of Picture would rise from it. If <hi rend="italic">Le Brun,</hi> who
            was famous for painting the Battles of this Heroe, had seen this lofty Description, what
            one Image could he have possibly taken from it? In what Colours would he have shewn us
              <hi rend="italic">Glory perch'd upon a Beaver?</hi> How would he have drawn <hi
              rend="italic">Fortune trembling?</hi> Or, indeed, what use could he have made of <hi
              rend="italic">pale Fates</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Immortals</hi> riding upon <hi
              rend="italic">Billows,</hi> with this blustering <hi rend="italic">God</hi> of his own
            making at the <hi rend="italic">head</hi> of them? <ref target="n106-1" n="120"
            >[106.1]</ref> Where, then, must have lain the Charm that once made the Publick so
            partial to this <pb n="107" entity="DSSR_000002909_0210"/> Tragedy? Why plainly, in the
            Grace and Harmony of the Actor's Utterance. For the Actor himself is not accountable for
            the false Poetry of his Author; That the Hearer is to judge of; if it passes upon him,
            the Actor can have no Quarrel to it; who, if the Periods given him are round, smooth,
            spirited, and high-sounding, even in a false Passion, must throw out the same Fire and
            Grace as may be required in one justly rising from Nature; where those his Excellencies
            will then be only more pleasing in proportion to the Taste of his Hearer. And I am of
            opinion that to the extraordinary Success of this very Play we may impute the Corruption
            of so many Actors and Tragick Writers, as were immediately misled by it. The unskilful
            Actor who imagin'd all the Merit of delivering those blazing Rants lay only in the
            Strength and strain'd Exertion of the Voice, began to tear his Lungs upon every false or
            slight Occasion to arrive at the same Applause. And it is from hence I date our having
            seen the same Reason prevalent for above fifty Years. Thus equally misguided, too, many
            a barren-brain'd Author has stream'd into a frothy flowing Style, pompously rolling into
            sounding Periods signifying&mdash;-roundly nothing; of which Number, in some of my
            former <pb n="108" entity="DSSR_000002909_0211"/> Labours, I am something more than
            suspicious that I may myself have made one. But to keep a little closer to <hi
              rend="italic">Betterton.</hi></p>
          <p>When this favourite Play I am speaking of, from its being too frequently acted, was
            worn out, and came to be deserted by the Town, upon the sudden Death of <hi
              rend="italic">Monfort,</hi> who had play'd <hi rend="italic">Alexander</hi> with
            Success for several Years, the Part was given to <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi>,
            which, under this great Disadvantage of the Satiety it had given, he immediately reviv'd
            with so new a Lustre that for three Days together it fill'd the House; <ref
              target="n108-1" n="121">[108.1]</ref> and had his then declining Strength been equal
            to the Fatigue the Action gave him, it probably might have doubled its Success; an
            uncommon Instance of the Power and intrinsick Merit of an Actor. This I mention not only
            to prove what irresistable Pleasure may arise from a judicious Elocution, with scarce
            Sense to assist it; but to shew you too, that tho' <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi>
            never wanted Fire and Force when his Character demanded it; yet, where it was not
            demanded, he never prostituted his Power to the low Ambition of a false Applause. And
            further, that when, from a too advanced Age, he resigned that toilsome Part of <hi
              rend="italic">Alexander,</hi> the Play for many Years after never was able to impose
            upon the Publick; <ref target="n108-2" n="122">[108.2]</ref> and I look upon his so
            particularly supporting <pb n="109" entity="DSSR_000002909_0212"/> the false Fire and
            Extravagancies of that Character to be a more surprizing Proof of his Skill than his
            being eminent in those of <hi rend="italic">Shakespear;</hi> because there, Truth and
            Nature coming to his Assistance, he had not the same Difficulties to combat, and
            consequently we must be less amaz'd at his Success where we are more able to account for
            it.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the extraordinary Power he shew'd in blowing <hi rend="italic"
              >Alexander</hi> once more into a blaze of Admiration, <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi>
            had so just a sense of what was true or false Applause, that I have heard him say, he
            never thought any kind of it equal to an attentive Silence; that there were many ways of
            deceiving an Audience into a loud one; but to keep them husht and quiet was an Applause
            which only Truth and Merit could arrive at: Of which Art there never was an equal Master
            to himself. From these various Excellencies, he had so full a Possession of the Esteem
            and Regard of his Auditors, that upon his Entrance into every Scene he seem'd to seize
            upon the Eyes and Ears of the Giddy and Inadvertent! To have talk'd or look'd another
            way would then have been thought Insensibility or Ignorance. <ref target="n109-1"
              n="123">[109.1]</ref> In all his Soliloquies of moment, the strong Intelligence of his
            Attitude and Aspect drew you into such an impatient Gaze and eager Expectation, that you
              <pb n="110" entity="DSSR_000002909_0213"/> almost imbib'd the Sentiment with your Eye
            before the Ear could reach it.</p>
          <p>As <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi> is the Centre to which all my Observations upon
            Action tend, you will give me leave, under his Character, to enlarge upon that Head. In
            the just Delivery of Poetical Numbers, particularly where the Sentiments are pathetick,
            it is scarce credible upon how minute an Article of Sound depends their greatest Beauty
            or Inaffection. The Voice of a Singer is not more strictly ty'd to Time and Tune, than
            that of an Actor in Theatrical Elocution: <ref target="n110-1" n="124">[110.1]</ref> The
            least Syllable too long or too slightly dwelt upon in a Period depreciates it to
            nothing; which very Syllable if rightly touch'd shall, like the heightening Stroke of
            Light from a Master's Pencil, give Life <pb n="111" entity="DSSR_000002909_0214"/> and
            Spirit to the whole. I never heard a Line in Tragedy come from <hi rend="italic"
              >Betterton</hi> wherein my Judgment, my ear, and my Imagination were not fully
            satisfy'd; which, since his Time, I cannot equally say of any one Actor whatsoever: Not
            but it is possible to be much his Inferior, with great Excellencies; which I shall
            observe in another Place. Had it been practicable to have ty'd down the clattering Hands
            of all the il judges who were commonly the Majority of an Audience, to what amazing
            Perfection might the <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Theatre have arrived with so just an
            Actor as <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi> at the Head of it! If what was Truth only
            could have been applauded, how many noisy Actors had shook their Plumes with shame, who,
            from the injudicious Approbation of the Multitude, have bawl'd and strutted in the place
            of Merit? If therefore the bare speaking Voice has such Allurements in it, how much less
            ought we to wonder, however we may lament, that the sweeter Notes of Vocal Musick should
            so have captivated even the <pb n="112" entity="DSSR_000002909_0215"/> politer World
            into an Apostacy from Sense to an Idolatry of Sound. Let us enquire from whence this
            Enchantment rises. I am afraid it may be too naturally accounted for: For when we
            complain that the finest Musick, purchas'd at such vast Expence, is so often thrown away
            upon the most miserable Poetry, we seem not to consider, that when the Movement of the
            Air and Tone of the Voice are exquisitely harmonious, tho' we regard not one <hi
              rend="italic">Word</hi> of what we hear, yet the Power of the Melody is so busy in the
            Heart, that we naturally annex Ideas to it of our own Creation, and, in some sort,
            become our selves the Poet to the Composer; and what Poet is so dull as not to be
            charm'd with the Child of his own Fancy? So that there is even a kind of Language in
            agreeable Sounds, which, like the Aspect of Beauty, without Words speaks and plays with
            the Imagination. While this Taste therefore is so naturally prevalent, I doubt to
            propose Remedies for it were but giving Laws to the Winds or Advice to Inamorato's: And
            however gravely we may assert that Profit ought always to be inseparable from the
            Delight of the Theatre; nay, admitting that the Pleasure would be heighten'd by the
            uniting them; yet, while Instruction is so little the Concern of the Auditor, how can we
            hope that so choice a Commodity will come to a Market where there is so seldom a Demand
            for it?</p>
          <p>It is not to the Actor, therefore, but to the vitiated and low Taste of the Spectator,
            that the Corruptions of the Stage (of what kind soever) have been owing. <pb n="113"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0216"/> If the Publick, by whom they must live, had Spirit
            enough to discountenance and declare against all the Trash and Fopperies they have been
            so frequently fond of, both the Actors and the Authors, to the best of their Power, must
            naturally have serv'd their daily Table with sound and wholesome Diet. <ref
              target="n113-1" n="125">[113.1]</ref> &mdash;- But I have not yet done with my
            Article of Elocution.</p>
          <p>As we have sometimes great Composers of Musick who cannot sing, we have as frequently
            great Writers that cannot read; and though without the nicest Ear no Man can be Master
            of Poetical Numbers, yet the best Ear in the World will not always enable him to
            pronounce them. Of this Truth <hi rend="italic">Dryden,</hi> our first great Master of
            Verse and Harmony, was a strong Instance: When he brought his Play of <hi rend="italic"
              >Amphytrion</hi> to the Stage, <ref target="n113-2" n="126">[113.2]</ref> I heard him
            give it his first Reading to the Actors, in which, though it is true he deliver'd the
            plain Sense of every Period, yet the whole was in so cold, so flat, and unaffecting a
            manner, that I am afraid of not being believ'd when I affirm it.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, <hi rend="italic">Lee,</hi> far his inferior in Poetry, was so
            pathetick a Reader of his own Scenes, that I have been inform'd by an Actor who was
            present, <pb n="114" entity="DSSR_000002909_0217"/> that while <hi rend="italic"
            >Lee</hi> was reading to Major <hi rend="italic">Mohun</hi> at a Rehearsal, <hi
              rend="italic">Mohun,</hi> in the Warmth of his Admiration, threw down his Part and
            said, Unless I were able to <hi rend="italic">play</hi> it as well as you <hi
              rend="italic">read</hi> it, to what purpose should I undertake it? And yet this very
            Author, whose Elocution rais'd such Admiration in so capital an Actor, when he attempted
            to be an Actor himself, soon quitted the Stage in an honest Despair of ever making any
            profitable Figure there. <ref target="n114-1" n="127">[114.1]</ref> From all this I
            would infer, That let our Conception of what we are to speak be ever so just, and the
            Ear ever so true, yet, when we are to deliver it to an Audience (I will leave Fear out
            of the question) there must go along with the whole a natural Freedom and becoming
            Grace, which is easier to conceive than to describe: For without this inexpressible
            Somewhat the Performance will come out oddly disguis'd, or somewhere defectively
            unsurprizing to the Hearer. Of this Defect, too, I will give you yet a stranger
            Instance, which you will allow Fear could not be the Occasion of: If you remember <hi
              rend="italic">Estcourt,</hi>
            <ref target="n114-2" n="128">[114.2]</ref> you must have known that he was long enough
            upon the Stage not to be under the least Restraint from Fear in his Performance: This
            Man was so amazing and extraordinary <pb n="115" entity="DSSR_000002909_0218"/> a
            Mimick, that no Man or Woman, from the Coquette to the Privy-Counsellor, ever mov'd or
            spoke before him, but he could carry their Voice, Look, Mien, and Motion, instantly into
            another Company: I have heard him make long Harangues and form various Arguments, even
            in the manner of thinking of an eminent Pleader at the Bar, <ref target="n115-1" n="129"
              >[115.1]</ref> with every the least Article and Singularity of his Utterance so
            perfectly imitated, that he was the very <hi rend="italic">alter ipse,</hi> scarce to be
            distinguish'd from his Original. Yet more; I have seen upon the Margin of the written
            Part of <hi rend="italic">Falstaff</hi> which he acted, his own Notes and Observations
            upon almost every Speech of it, describing the true Spirit of the Humour, and with what
            Tone of Voice, Look, and Gesture, each of them ought to be delivered. Yet in his
            Execution upon the Stage he seem'd to have lost all those just Ideas he had form'd of
            it, and almost thro' the Character labour'd under a heavy Load of Flatness: In a word,
            with all his Skill in Mimickry and Knowledge of what ought to be done, he never upon the
            Stage could bring it truly into Practice, but was upon the whole a languid, unaffecting
            Actor. <ref target="n115-2" n="130">[115.2]</ref> After I <pb n="116"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0219"/> have shewn you so many necessary Qualifications, not
            one of which can be spar'd in true Theatrical Elocution, and have at the same time
            prov'd that with the Assistance of them all united, the whole may still come forth
            defective; what Talents shall we say will infallibly form an Actor? This I confess is
            one of Nature's Secrets, too deep for me to dive into; let us content our selves
            therefore with affirming, That <hi rend="italic">Genius,</hi> which Nature only gives,
            only can complete him. This <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi> then was so strong in <hi
              rend="italic">Betterton,</hi> that it shone out in every Speech and Motion of him. Yet
            Voice and Person are such necessary Supports to it, that by the Multitude they have been
            preferr'd to <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi> itself, or at least often mistaken for it.
              <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi> had a Voice of that kind which gave more Spirit to
            Terror than to the softer Passions; of more Strength than Melody. <ref target="n116-1"
              n="131">[116.1]</ref> The Rage and Jealousy of <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> became
            him better than the Sighs and Tenderness of <hi rend="italic">Castalio:</hi>
            <ref target="n116-2" n="132">[116.2]</ref> For though in <hi rend="italic">Castalio</hi>
            he only excell'd others, in <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> he excell'd himself; which
            you will easily believe 'when you consider that, in spite of his Complexion, <hi
              rend="italic">Othello</hi> has more natural Beauties than the best Actor can find in
            all the Magazine of Poetry to animate his Power and delight his Judgment with.</p>
          <p>The Person of this excellent Actor was suitable to his Voice, more manly than sweet,
            not exceeding the <pb n="117" entity="DSSR_000002909_0220"/> middle Stature, inclining
            to the corpulent; of a serious and penetrating Aspect; his Limbs nearer the athletick
            than the delicate Proportion; yet however form'd, there arose from the Harmony of the
            whole a commanding Mien of Majesty, which the fairer-fac'd or (as <hi rend="italic"
              >Shakespear</hi> calls 'em) the <hi rend="italic">durlea</hi> Darlings of his Time
            ever wanted something to be equal Masters of. There was some Years ago to be had, almost
            in every Print-shop, a <hi rend="italic">Metzotinto</hi> from <hi rend="italic"
            >Kneller,</hi> extremely like him. <ref target="n117-1" n="133">[117.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>In all I have said of <hi rend="italic">Betterton,</hi> I confine myself to the Time of
            his Strength and highest Power in Action, that you may make Allowances from what he was
            able to execute at Fifty, to what you might have seen of him at past Seventy; for tho'
            to the last he was without his Equal, he might not then be equal to his former Self; yet
            so far was he from being ever overtaken, that for many Years after his Decease I seldom
            saw any of his Parts in <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> supply'd by others, but it
            drew from me the Lamentation of <hi rend="italic">Ophelia</hi> upon <hi rend="italic"

            >Melantius</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Maid's Tragedy,</hi> for his own Benefit; <ref
              target="n117-2" n="134">[117.2]</ref> when being suddenly seiz'd by the <pb n="118"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0221"/> Gout, he submitted, by extraordinary Applications, to

            <p> Sir William Davenant was the son of a vintner and innkeeper at Oxford. It was said
              that Shakespeare used frequently to stay at the inn, and a story accordingly was
              manufactured that William Davenant was in fact the son of the poet through an amour
              with Mrs. Davenant. But of this there is no shadow of proof. Davenant went to Oxford,
              but made no special figure as a scholar, winning fame, however, as a poet and
              dramatist. On the death of Ben Jonson in 1637 he was appointed Poet-Laureate, and in
              1639 received a licence from Charles I. to get together a company of players. In the
              Civil War he greatly distinguished himself, and was knighted by the King for his
              bravery. Before the Restoration Davenant was permitted by Cromwell to perform some
              sort of theatrical pieces at Rutland House, in Charter-House Yard, where "The Siege of
              Rhodes" was played about 1656. At the Restoration a Patent was granted to him in
              August, 1660, and he engaged Rhodes's company of Players, including Betterton,
              Kynaston, Underhill, and Nokes. Another Patent was granted to him, dated 15th January,
              1663, (see copy of Patent given <hi rend="italic">ante</hi>,) under which he managed
              the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields till his death in 1668. Davenant's company were
              called the Duke's Players. The changes which were made in the conduct of the stage
              during Davenant's career, such as the introduction of elaborate scenery and the first
              appearance of women in plays, make it one of the first interest and importance. (See
              Mr. Joseph Knight's Preface to his recent edition of the "Roscius Anglicanus.")</p>

            <p> Thomas Killigrew (not "Henry" Killigrew, as Cibber erroneously writes) was a very
              noted and daring humorist. He was a faithful adherent of King Charles I., and at the
              Restoration was made a Groom of the Bedchamber. He also received a Patent, dated 25th
              April, 1662, to raise a company of actors to be called the King's Players. These acted
              at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane. Killigrew survived the Union of the two Companies
              in 1682, dying on the 19th of March, 1683. He cannot be said to have made much mark in
              theatrical history. The best anecdote of Killigrew is that related by Granger, how he
              waited on Charles II. one day dressed like a Pilgrim bound on a long journey. When the
              King asked him whither he was going, he replied, "To Hell, to fetch back Oliver
              Cromwell to take care of England, for his successor takes none at all."</p>

              appears however that it lasted to Queen Anne's time, as the alteration of 'Wit without
              Money' is dedicated to Thomas Newman, Servant to her Majesty, one of the Gentlemen of
              the Great Chamber, and Book-keeper and Prompter to her Majesty's Company of Comedians
              in the Haymarket." Dr. Doran in his "Their Majesties' Servants" (1888 edition, iii.
              419), says that he was informed by Benjamin Webster that Baddeley was the last actor
              who wore the uniform of scarlet and gold prescribed for the Gentlemen of the
              Household, who were patented actors.</p>

            <p> The question of the identity of the first English actress is a very intricate one.
              Mr. Percy Fitzgerald, in his "New History of the English Stage," seems to incline to
              favour Anne Marshall, while Mr. Joseph Knight, in his edition of the "Roscius
              Anglicanus," pronounces for Mrs. Coleman. Davies says positively that "the first woman
              actress was the mother of Norris, commonly called Jubilee Dicky." Thomas Jordan wrote
              a Prologue "to introduce the first woman that came to act on the stage," but as the
              lady's name is not given, this doe snot help us. The distinction is also claimed for
              Mrs. Saunderson (afterwards Mrs. Betterton) and Margaret Hughes. But since Mr. Knight
              has shown that the performances in 1656 at Rutland House, where Mrs. Coleman appeared,
              were for money, I do not see that we can escape from the conclusion that this lady was
              the first English professional actress. Who the first actress after the Restoration
              was is as yet unsettled.</p>

              considering that Betterton could never have acted Othello, Brutus, or Hotspur (the
              very parts for which Cibber praises him so much) if there had not been a junction of

            <p> Bellchambers notes on this passage: "The criticisms of Cibber upon a literary
              subject are hardly worth the trouble of confuting, and yet it may be mentioned that
              Bishop Warburton adduced these lines as containing not only the most sublime, but the
              most judicious imagery that poetry can conceive. If Le Brun, or any other artist,
              could not succeed in pourtraying the terrors of fortune, it conveys, perhaps, the
              highest possible compliment to the powers of Lee, to admit that he has mastered a
              difficulty beyond the most daring aspirations of an accomplished painter." With all
              respect to Warburton and Bellchambers, I cannot help remarking that this last sentence
              seems to me perilously like nonsense.</p>

            <p> Anthony Aston says of Mrs. Barry: "Neither she, nor any of the Actors of those
              Times, had any Tone in their Speaking, (too much, lately, in Use.)" But the line of
              criticism which Cibber takes up here would lead to the conclusion that Aston is not
              strictly accurate; and, moreover, I can scarcely imagine how, if these older actors
              used to "tone," the employment of it should have been so general as it certainly was a
              few years after Betterton's death. Victor ("History," ii. 164) writes of "the good old
              Manner of singing and quavering out their tragic Notes," and on the same page mentions
              Cibber's "quavering Tragedy Tones." My view, also, is confirmed by the facts that in
              the preface to "The Fairy Queen," 1692, it is said: "he must be a very ignorant
              Player, who knows not there is a Musical Cadence in speaking; and that a Man may as
              well speak out of Tune, as sing out of Tune;" and that Aaron Hill, in his dedication
              of "The Fatal Vision," 1716, reprobates the "affected, vicious, and unnatural tone of
              voice, so common on the stage at that time." See Genest, iv. 16-17. An admirable
              description of this method of reciting is given by Cumberland ("Memoirs," 2nd edition,
              i. 80): "Mrs. Cibber in a key, high-pitched but sweet withal, sung, or rather
              recitatived Rowe's harmonious strain, something in the manner of the Improvisatories:
              it was so extremely wanting in contrast, that, though it did not wound the ear, it
              wearied it." Cumberland is writing of Mrs. Cibber in the earlier part of her career
              (1746), when the teaching of her husband's father, Colley Cibber, influenced her
              acting: no doubt Garrick, who exploded the old way of speaking, made her ultimately
              modify her style. Yet as she was, even in 1746, a very distinguished pathetic actress,
              we are forced to the conclusion that the old style must have been more effective than
              we are disposed to believe.</p>

          <p>THO', as I have before observ'd, Women were not admitted to the Stage 'till the Return
            of King <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi>, yet it could not be so suddenly supply'd with
            them but that there was still a Necessity, for some time, to put the handsomest young
            Men into Petticoats; <ref target="n119-1" n="137">[119.1]</ref> which <hi rend="italic"
              >Kynaston</hi> was then said to have <pb n="120" entity="DSSR_000002909_0223"/> worn
            with Success; particularly in the Part of <hi rend="italic">Evadne</hi> in the <hi
              rend="italic">Maid's Tragedy,</hi> which I have heard him speak of, and which calls to
            my Mind a ridiculous Distress that arose from these sort of Shifts which the Stage was
            then put to.&mdash;The King coming a little before his usual time to a Tragedy,
            found the Actors not ready to begin, when his Majesty, not chusing to have as much
            Patience as his good Subjects, sent to them to know the Meaning of it; upon which the
            Master of the Company came to the Box, and rightly judging that the best Excuse for
            their Default would be the true one, fairly told his Majesty that the Queen was not <hi
              rend="italic">shav'd</hi> yet: The King, whose good Humour lov'd to laugh at a Jest as
            well as to make one, accepted the Excuse, which serv'd to divert him till the male Queen
            cou'd be effeminated. In a word, <hi rend="italic">Kynaston</hi> at that time was so
            beautiful a Youth that the Ladies of Quality prided themselves <pb n="121"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0224"/> in taking him with them in their Coaches to <hi
              rend="italic">Hyde-Park</hi> in his Theatrical Habit, after the Play; which in those
            Days they might have sufficient time to do, because Plays then were us'd to begin at
            four a-Clock: The Hour that People of the same Rank are now going to
            Dinner.&mdash;Of this Truth I had the Curiosity to enquire, and had it confirm'd
            from his own Mouth in his advanc'd Age: And indeed, to the last of him, his Handsomeness
            was very little abated; even at past Sixty his Teeth were all sound, white, and even, as
            one would wish to see in a reigning Toast of Twenty. He had something of a formal
            Gravity in his Mien, which was attributed to the stately Step he had been so early
            confin'd to, in a female Decency. But even that in Characters of Superiority had its
            proper Graces; it misbecame him not in the Part of <hi rend="italic">Leon</hi>, in <hi
              rend="italic">Fletcher</hi>'s <hi rend="italic">Rule a Wife, &amp;c.</hi> which he
            executed with a determin'd Manliness and honest Authority well worth the best Actor's
            Imitation. He had a piercing Eye, and in Characters of heroick Life a quick imperious
            Vivacity in his Tone of Voice that painted the Tyrant truly terrible. There were two
            Plays of <hi rend="italic">Dryden</hi> in which he shone with uncommon Lustre; in <hi
              rend="italic">Aurenge-Zebe</hi> he play'd <hi rend="italic">Morat</hi>, and in <hi
              rend="italic">Don Sebastian, Muley Moloch;</hi> in both these Parts he had a fierce,
            Lion-like Majesty in his Port and Utterance that gave the Spectator a kind of trembling
            Admiration!</p>
          <p>Here I cannot help observing upon a modest Mistake which I thought the late Mr. <hi
              rend="italic">Booth</hi> committed <pb n="122" entity="DSSR_000002909_0225"/> in his
            acting the Part of <hi rend="italic">Morat.</hi> There are in this fierce Character so
            many Sentiments of avow'd Barbarity, Insolence, and Vain-glory, that they blaze even to
            a ludicrous Lustre, and doubtless the Poet intended those to make his Spectators laugh
            while they admir'd them; but <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> thought it depreciated the
            Dignity of Tragedy to raise a Smile in any part of it, and therefore cover'd these kind
            of Sentiments with a scrupulous Coldness and unmov'd Delivery, as if he had fear'd the
            Audience might take too familiar a notice of them. <ref target="n122-1" n="138"
            >[122.1]</ref> In Mr. <hi rend="italic">Addison</hi>'s <hi rend="italic">Cato, Syphax</hi>
            <ref target="n122-2" n="139">[122.2]</ref> has some Sentiments of near the same nature,

              rend="italic">Kynaston</hi> would have done had he been then living to have stood in
            the same Character. Mr. <hi rend="italic">Addison,</hi> who had something of Mr. <hi
              rend="italic">Booth</hi>'s Diffidence at the Rehearsal of his Play, after it was acted
            came into my Opinion, and own'd that even Tragedy on such particular Occasions might
            admit of a <hi rend="italic">Laugh</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Approbation.</hi>
            <ref target="n123-1" n="140">[123.1]</ref> In <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi>
            Instances of them are frequent, as in <hi rend="italic">Mackbeth, Hotspur, Richard the
              Third,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Harry the Eighth,</hi>
            <ref target="n123-2" n="141">[123.2]</ref> all which Characters, tho' of a tragical <pb
              n="124" entity="DSSR_000002909_0231"/> Cast, have sometimes familiar Strokes in them
            so highly natural to each particular Disposition, that it is impossible not to be
            transported into an honest Laughter at them: And these are those happy Liberties which,
            tho' few Authors are qualify'd to take, yet, when justly taken, may challenge a Place
            among their greatest Beauties. Now, whether <hi rend="italic">Dryden,</hi> in his <hi
              rend="italic">Morat, feliciter Audet,</hi>
            <ref target="n124-1" n="142">[124.1]</ref> &mdash;or may be allow'd the Happiness of
            having hit this Mark, seems not necessary to be determin'd by the Actor, whose Business,
            sure, is to make the best of his Author's Intention, as in this Part <hi rend="italic"
              >Kynaston</hi> did, doubtless not without <hi rend="italic">Dryden</hi>'s Approbation.
            For these Reasons then, I thought my good Friend, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> (who
            certainly had many Excellencies) carry'd his Reverence for the Buskin too far, in not
            following the bold Flights of the Author with that Wantonness of Spirit which the Nature
            of those Sentiments demanded: For Example! <hi rend="italic">Morat</hi> having a
            criminal Passion for <hi rend="italic">Indamora,</hi> promises, at her Request, for one
            Day to spare the Life of her Lover <hi rend="italic">Aurenge-Zebe:</hi> But not chusing
            to make known the real Motive of his Mercy, when <hi rend="italic">Nourmahal</hi> says
            to him, <hi rend="italic">'Twill not be safe to let him live an Hour!</hi>
            <pb n="125" entity="DSSR_000002909_0232"/>
            <hi rend="italic">Morat</hi> silences her with this heroical <hi rend="italic"
              >Rhodomontade, I'll do't, to shew my Arbitrary Power.</hi>
            <ref target="n125-1" n="143">[125.1]</ref>
            <hi rend="italic">Risum tebeatus?</hi> It was impossible not to laugh and reasonably
            too, when this Line came out of the Mouth of <hi rend="italic">Kynaston,</hi>
            <ref target="n125-2" n="144">[125.2]</ref> with the stern and haughty Look that attended
            it. But above this tyrannical, tumid Superiority of Character there is a grave and
            rational Majesty in <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi>'s <hi rend="italic">Harry the
              Fourth,</hi> which, tho' not so glaring to the vulgar Eye, requires thrice the Skill
            and Grace to become and support. Of this real Majesty <hi rend="italic">Kynaston</hi>
            was entirely Master; here every Sentiment came from him as if it had been his own, as if
            he had himself that instant conceiv'd it, as if he had lost the Player and were the real
            King he personated! a Perfection so rarely found, that very often, in Actors of good
            Repute, a certain Vacancy of Look, Inanity of Voice, or superfluous Gesture, shall
            unmask the Man to the judicious Spectator, who, from the least of those Errors, plainly
            sees the whole but a Lesson given him to be got by Heart from some great Author whose
            Sense is deeper than the Repeater's Understanding. This true Majesty <hi rend="italic"
              >Kynaston</hi> had so entire a Command of, that when he whisper'd the following plain
            Line to <hi rend="italic">Hotspur, Send us your Prisoners, or you'll hear of it!</hi>
            <ref target="n125-3" n="145">[125.3]</ref>
            <pb n="126" entity="DSSR_000002909_0233"/> He convey'd a more terrible Menace in it than
            the loudest Intemperance of Voice could swell to. But let the bold Imitator beware, for
            without the Look and just Elocution that waited on it an Attempt of the same nature may
            fall to nothing.</p>
          <p>But the Dignity of this Character appear'd in <hi rend="italic">Kynaston</hi> still
            more shining in the private Scene between the King and Prince his Son: There you saw
            Majesty in that sort of Grief which only Majesty could feel!@ there the paternal Concern
            for the Errors of the Son made the Monarch more rever'd and dreaded: His Reproaches so
            just, yet so unmix'd with Anger (and therefore the more piercing) opening as it were the
            Arms of Nature with a secret Wish, that filial Duty and Penitence wak'd, might fall into
            them with Grace and Honour. In this affecting Scene I thought <hi rend="italic"
            >Kynaston</hi> shew'd his most masterly Strokes of Nature; expressing all the various
            Motions of the Heart with the same Force, Dignity and Feeling, they are written; adding
            to the whole that peculiar and becoming Grace which the best Writer cannot inspire into
            any Actor that is not born with it. What made the Merit of this Actor and that of <hi
              rend="italic">Betterton</hi> more surprizing, was that though they both observ'd the
            Rules of Truth and Nature, they were each as different in their manner of acting as in
            their personal Form and Features. But <hi rend="italic">Kynaston</hi> staid too long
            upon the Stage, till his Memory and Spirit began to fail him. I shall not therefore say
            any thing of his Imperfections, <pb n="127" entity="DSSR_000002909_0234"/> which, at
            that time, were visibly not his own, but the Effects of decaying Nature. <ref

          <p><hi rend="italic">Monfort,</hi>
            <ref target="n127-2" n="147">[127.2]</ref> a younger Man by twenty Years, and at this
            time in his highest Reputation, was an Actor of a very different Style: Of Person he was
            tall, well made, fair, and of an agreeable Aspect: His Voice clear, full, and melodious:
            In Tragedy he was the most affecting Lover within my Memory. His Addresses had a
            resistless Recommendation from the very Tone of his Voice, which gave his words such
            Softness that, as <hi rend="italic">Dryden</hi> says,</p>

          <lg type="verse">
            <l>
              <hi rend="italic">&mdash;-Like Flakes of feather'd Snow,</hi>

          </lg>


          <p>All this he particularly verify'd in that Scene of <hi rend="italic">Alexander,</hi>
            where the Heroe throws himself at the Feet of <hi rend="italic">Statira</hi> for Pardon
            of his past Infidelities. There we saw the Great, the Tender, the Penitent, the
            Despairing, the Transported, and the Amiable, in the highest Perfection. In Comedy he
            gave the truest Life to what we call the <hi rend="italic">Fine Gentleman;</hi> his
            Spirit shone the brighter for being polish'd with Decency: In Scenes of Gaiety he never
            broke into the Regard that was due to the Presence of equal or superior Characters, tho'
            inferior Actors play'd them; he fill'd the Stage, not by elbowing and crossing it before
            others, or disconcerting their Action, but by surpassing them in true masterly Touches
            of <pb n="128" entity="DSSR_000002909_0235"/> Nature. He never laugh'd at his own Jest,
            unless the Point of his Raillery upon another requir'd it.&mdash; He had a
            particular Talent in giving Life to <hi rend="italic">bons Mots</hi> and <hi
              rend="italic">Repartees:</hi> The Wit of the Poet seem'd always to come from him <hi
              rend="italic">extempore,</hi> and sharpen'd into more Wit from his brillant manner of
            delivering it; he had himself a good Share of it, or what is equal to it, so lively a
            Pleasantness of Humour, that when either of these fell into his Hands upon the Stage, he
            wantoned with them to the highest Delight of his Auditors. The <hi rend="italic"
              >agreeable</hi> was so natural to him, that even in that dissolute Character of the
              <hi rend="italic">Rover</hi>
            <ref target="n128-1" n="149">[128.1]</ref> he seem'd to wash off the Guilt from Vice,
            and gave it Charms and Merit. For tho' it may be a Reproach to the Poet to draw such
            Characters not only unpunish'd but rewarded, the Actor may still be allow'd his due
            Praise in his excellent Performance. And this is a Distinction which, when this Comedy
            was acted at <hi rend="italic">Whitehall,</hi> King <hi rend="italic">William</hi>'s
            Queen <hi rend="italic">Mary</hi> was pleased to make in favour of <hi rend="italic"
              >Monfort,</hi> notwithstanding her Disapprobation of the Play.</p>
          <p>He had, besides all this, a Variety in his Genius which few capital Actors have shewn,
            or perhaps have thought it any Addition to their Merit to arrive at; he could entirely
            change himself; could at once throw off the Man of Sense for the brisk, vain, rude, and
            lively Coxcomb, the false, flashy Pretender to Wit, and the Dupe of his own Sufficiency:
            Of <pb n="129" entity="DSSR_000002909_0236"/> this he gave a delightful Instance in the
            Character of <hi rend="italic">Sparkish</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Wycherly</hi>'s <hi
              rend="italic">Country Wife.</hi> In that of Sir <hi rend="italic">Courtly Nice</hi>
            <ref target="n129-1" n="150">[129.1]</ref> his Excellence was still greater: There his
            whole Man, Voice, Mien, and Gesture was no longer <hi rend="italic">Monfort,</hi> but
            another Person. There, the insipid, soft Civility, the elegant and formal Mien, the
            drawling Delicacy of Voice, the stately Flatness of his Address, and the empty Eminence
            of his Attitudes were so nicely observ'd and guarded by him, that he had not been an
            entire Master of Nature had he not kept his Judgment, as it were, a Centinel upon
            himself, not to admit the least Likeness of what he us'd to be to enter into any Part of
            his Performance, he could not possibly have so completely finish'd it. If, some Years
            after the Death of <hi rend="italic">Monfort,</hi> I my self had any Success in either
            of these Characters, I must pay the Debt I owe to his Memory, in confessing the
            Advantages I receiv'd from the just Idea and strong Impression he had given me from his
            acting them. Had he been remember'd when I first attempted them my Defects would have
            been more easily discover'd, and consequently my favourable Reception in them must have
            been very much and justly abated. If it could be remembred how much he had the Advantage
            of me in Voice and Person, I could not here be suspected of an affected Modesty or of
            over-valuing his Excellence: For he sung a clear counter-tenour, and had <pb n="130"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0237"/> a melodious, warbling Throat, which could not but set
            off the last Scene of Sir <hi rend="italic">Courtly</hi> with an uncommon Happiness;
            which I, alas! could only struggle thro' with the faint Excuses and real Confidence of a
            fine Singer under the Imperfection of a feign'd and screaming Trebble, which at best
            could only shew you what I would have done had Nature been more favourable to me.</p>
          <p>This excellent Actor was cut off by a tragical Death in the 33rd Year of his Age,
            generally lamented by his Friends and all Lovers of the Theatre. The particular
            Accidents that attended his Fall are to be found at large in the Trial of the Lord <hi
              rend="italic">Mohun,</hi> printed among those of the State, in <hi rend="italic"
              >Folio.</hi>
            <ref target="n130-1" n="151">[130.1]</ref>
          </p>


          <p><hi rend="italic">Sandford</hi> might properly be term'd the <hi rend="italic"
              >Spagnolet</hi> of the Theatre, an excellent Actor in disagreeable <pb n="131"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0238"/> Characters: For as the chief Pieces of that famous
            Painter were of Human Nature in Pain and Agony, so <hi rend="italic">Sandford</hi> upon
            the Stage was generally as flagitious as a <hi rend="italic">Creon,</hi> a <hi
              rend="italic">Maligni,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Iago,</hi> or a <hi rend="italic"
              >Machiavil</hi>
            <ref target="n131-1" n="152">[131.1]</ref> could make him. The Painter, 'tis true, from
            the Fire of his Genius might think the quiet Objects of Nature too tame for his Pencil,
            and therefore chose to indulge it in its full Power upon those of Violence and Horror:
            But poor <hi rend="italic">Sandford</hi> was not the Stage-Villain by Choice, but from
            Necessity; for having a low and crooked Person, such bodily Defects were too strong to
            be admitted into great or amiable Characters; so that whenever in any new or revived
            Play there was a hateful or mischievous Person, <hi rend="italic">Sandford</hi> was sure
            to have no Competitor for it: Nor indeed (as we are not to suppose a Villain or Traitor
            can be shewn for our Imitation, or not for our Abhorrence) can it be doubted but the
            less comely the Actor's Person the fitter he may be to perform them. The Spectator too,
            by not being misled by a tempting Form, may be less inclin'd to excuse the wicked or
            immoral Views or Sentiments of them. And though the hard Fate of an <hi rend="italic"
              >Oedipus</hi> might naturally give the Humanity of an Audience thrice the Pleasure
            that could arise form the wilful Wickedness of the best acted <hi rend="italic"
            >Creon,</hi> yet who could say that <hi rend="italic">Sandford</hi> in such a Part was
            not Master of as true and just Action as the best Tragedian could <pb n="132"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0239"/> be whose happier Person had recommended him to the
            virtuous Heroe, or any other more pleasing Favourite of the Imagination? In this
            disadvantageous Light, then, stood <hi rend="italic">Sandford</hi> as an Actor; admir'd
            by the Judicious, while the crowd only prais'd him by their Prejudice. <ref
              target="n132-1" n="153">[132.1]</ref> And so unusual had it been to see <hi
              rend="italic">Sandford</hi> an innocent Man in a Play, that whenever he was so, the
            Spectators would hardly give him credit in so gross an Improbability. Let me give you an
            odd Instance of it, which I heard <hi rend="italic">Monfort</hi> say was a real Fact. A
            new Play (the Name of it I have forgot) was brought upon the Stage, wherein <hi
              rend="italic">Sandford</hi> happen'd to perform the Part of an honest Statesman: The
            Pit, after they had sate three or four Acts in a quiet Expectation that the
            well-dissembled Honesty of <hi rend="italic">Sandford</hi> (for such of course they
            concluded it) would soon be discover'd, or at least, from its Security, involve the
            Actors in the Play in some surprizing Distress or Confusion, which might raise and
            animate the Scenes to come; when, at last, finding no such matter, but that the
            Catastrophe had taken quite another Turn, and that <pb n="133"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0240"/>
            <hi rend="italic">Sandford</hi> was really an honest Man to the end of the Play, they
            fairly damn'd it, as if the Author had impos'd upon them the most frontless or
            incredible Absurdity. <ref target="n133-1" n="154">[133.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>It is not improbable but that from <hi rend="italic">Sandford</hi>'s so masterly
            personating Characters of Guilt, the inferior Actors might think his Success chiefly
            owing to the Defects of his Person; and from thence might take occasion, whenever they
            appear'd as Bravo's or Murtherers, to make themselves as frightful and as inhuman
            Figures as possible. In King <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi>'s time, this low Skill was
            carry'd to such an Extravagance, that the King himself, who was black-brow'd and of a
            swarthy Complexion, pass'd a pleasant Remark upon his observing the grim Looks of the
            Murtherers in <hi rend="italic">Mackbeth;</hi> when, turning to his People in the Box
            about him, <hi rend="italic">Pray, what is the Meaning,</hi> said he, <hi rend="italic"
              >that we never see a Rogue in a Play, but, Godsfish! they always clap him on a black
              Perriwig? when it is well known one of the greatest Rogues in</hi> England <hi
              rend="italic">always wears a fair one?</hi> Now, whether or no Dr. <hi rend="italic"
              >Oates</hi> at that time wore his own Hair I <pb n="134" entity="DSSR_000002909_0241"
            /> cannot be positive: Or, if his Majesty pointed at some greater Man then our of Power,
            I leave those to guess at him who may yet remember the changing Complexion of his
            Ministers. <ref target="n134-1" n="155">[134.1]</ref> This Story I had from <hi
              rend="italic">Betterton,</hi> who was a Man of Veracity: And I confess I should have
            thought the King's Observation a very just one, though he himself had been fair as <hi
              rend="italic">Adonis.</hi> Nor can I in this Question help voting with the Court; for
            were it not too gross a Weakness to employ in wicked Purposes Men whose very suspected
            Looks might be enough to betray them? Or are we to suppose it unnatural that a Murther
            should be thoroughly committed out of an old red Coat and a black Perriwig?</p>
          <p>For my own part, I profess myself to have been an Admirer of <hi rend="italic"
              >Sandford,</hi> and have often lamented that his masterly Performance could not be
            rewarded with that Applause which I saw much inferior Actors met with, merely because
            they stood in more laudable Characters. For, tho' it may be a Merit in an Audience to
            applaud Sentiments of Virtue and Honour; yet there seems to be an equal Justice that no
            Distinction should be made as to the Excellence of an Actor, whether in a good or evil
            Character; since neither the Vice nor the Virtue of it is his own, but given him by the
            Poet: Therefore, why is not the Actor who shines in either equally
            commendable?&mdash; No, Sir; this may be Reason, but that is not always a Rule with
            us; the Spectator will tell you, that when <pb n="135" entity="DSSR_000002909_0242"/>
            Virtue is applauded he gives part of it to himself; because his Applause at the same
            time lets others about him see that he himself admires it. But when a wicked Action is
            going forward; when an <hi rend="italic">Iago</hi> is meditating Revenge and Mischief;
            tho' Art and Nature may be equally strong in the Actor, the Spectator is shy of his
            Applause, lest he should in some sort be look'd upon as an Aider or an Abettor of the
            Wickedness in view; and therefore rather chuses to rob the Actor of the Praise he may
            merit, than give it him in a Character which he would have you see his Silence modestly
            discourages. Form the same fond Principle many Actors have made it a Point to be seen in
            Parts sometimes even flatly written, only because they stood in the favourable Light of
            Honour and Virtue. <ref target="n135-1" n="156">[135.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>I have formerly known an Actress carry this Theatrical Prudery to such a height, that
            she was very near keeping herself chaste by it: Her Fondness for Virtue on the Stage she
            began to think might perswade the World that it had made an Impression on her private
            Life; and the Appearances of it actually went so far that, in an Epilogue to an obscure
            Play, the Profits of which were given to her, and wherein she acted a Part of
            impregnable Chastity, <pb n="136" entity="DSSR_000002909_0243"/> she bespoke the Favour
            of the Ladies by a Protestation that in Honour of their Goodness and Virtue she would
            dedicate her unblemish'd Life to their Example. Part of this Vestal Vow, I remember, was
            contain'd in the following Verse:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>
              <hi rend="italic">Study to live the Character I play.</hi>
              <ref target="n136-1" n="157">[136.1]</ref>
            </l>
          </lg>




          <p>But alas! how weak are the strongest Works of Art when Nature besieges it? for though
            this good Creature so far held out her Distaste to Mankind that they could never reduce
            her to marry any one of 'em; yet we must own she grew, like <hi rend="italic"
              >C&aelig;sar</hi>, greater by her Fall! Her first heroick Motive to a Surrender
            was to save the Life of a Lover who in his Despair had vow'd to destroy himself, with
            which Act of Mercy (in a jealous Dispute once in my Hearing) she was provoked to
            reproach him in these very Words: <hi rend="italic">Villain! did not I save your
            Life?</hi> The generous Lover, in return to that first tender Obligation, gave Life to
            her First-born, <ref target="n136-2" n="158">[136.2]</ref> and that pious Offspring has
            since raised to her Memory several innocent Grandchildren.</p>
          <pb n="137" entity="DSSR_000002909_0244"/>
          <p>So that, as we see, it is not the Hood that makes the Monk, nor the Veil the Vestal; I
            am apt to think that if the personal Morals of an Actor were to be weighed by his
            Appearance on the Stage, the Advantage and Favour (if any were due to either side) might
            rather incline to the Traitor than the Heroe, to the <hi rend="italic">Sempronius</hi>
            than the <hi rend="italic">Cato,</hi> or to the <hi rend="italic">Syphax</hi> than the
              <hi rend="italic">Juba:</hi> Because no Man can naturally desire to cover his Honesty
            with a wicked Appearance; but an ill Man might possibly incline to cover his Guilt with
            the Appearance of Virtue, which was the Case of the frail Fair One now mentioned. But be
            this Question decided as it may, <hi rend="italic">Sandford</hi> always appear'd to me
            the honester Man in proportion to the Spirit wherewith he exposed the wicked and immoral
            Characters he acted: For had his Heart been unsound, or tainted with the least Guilt of
            them, his Conscience must, in spite of him, in any too near a Resemblance of himself,
            have been a Check upon the Vivacity of his Action. <hi rend="italic">Sandford</hi>
            therefore might be said to have contributed his equal Share with the foremost Actors to
            the true and laudable Use of the Stage: And in this Light too, of being so frequently
            the Object of common Distaste, we may honestly stile him a Theatrical Martyr to Poetical
            Justice: For in making Vice odious or Virtue amiable, where does the Merit differ? To
            hate the one or love the other are but leading Steps to the same Temple of Fame, tho' at
            different Portals. <ref target="n137-1" n="159">[137.1]</ref>
          </p>
          <pb n="138" entity="DSSR_000002909_0245"/>
          <p>This Actor, in his manner of Speaking, varied very much from those I have already
            mentioned. His Voice had an acute and piercing Tone, which struck every Syllable of his
            Words distinctly upon the Ear. He had likewise a peculiar Skill in his Look of marking
            out to an Audience whatever he judg'd worth their more than ordinary Notice. When he
            deliver'd a Command, he would sometimes give it more Force by seeming to slight the
            Ornament of Harmony. In <hi rend="italic">Dryden</hi>'s Plays of Rhime, he as little as
            possible glutted the Ear with the Jingle of it, rather chusing, when the Sense would
            permit him, to lose it, than to value it.</p>
          <p>Had <hi rend="italic">Sandford</hi> liv'd in <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi>'s Time,
            I am confident his Judgment must have chose him above all other Actors to have play'd
            his <hi rend="italic">Richard the Third:</hi> I leave his Person out of the Question,
            which, tho' naturally made for it, yet that would have been the the least Part of his
            Recommendation; <hi rend="italic">Sandford</hi> had stronger Claims to it; he had
            sometimes an uncouth Stateliness in his Motion, a harsh and sullen Pride of Speech, a
            meditating Brow, a stern Aspect, occasionally changing into an almost ludicrous Triumph
            over all Goodness and Virtue: From thence falling into the most asswasive Gentleness and
            soothing Candour of a designing Heart. These, I say, must have preferr'd him to it;
            these would have been Colours so essentially shining in that Character, that it will be
            no Dispraise to that great Author to say, <hi rend="italic">Sandford</hi> must have
            shewn as many masterly <pb n="139" entity="DSSR_000002909_0246"/> Strokes in it (had he
            ever acted it) as are visible in the Writing it. <ref target="n139-1" n="160"

          <p>When I first brought <hi rend="italic">Richard the Third</hi>
            <ref target="n139-2" n="161">[139.2]</ref> (with such Alterations as I thought not
            improper) to the Stage, <hi rend="italic">Sandford</hi> was engaged in the Company then
            acting under King <hi rend="italic">William</hi>'s Licence in <hi rend="italic"
              >Lincoln's-Inn-Fields;</hi> otherwise you cannot but suppose my Interest must have
            offer'd him that Part. What encouraged me, therefore, to attempt it myself at the <hi
              rend="italic">Theatre-Royal,</hi> was that I imagined I knew how <hi rend="italic"
              >Sandford</hi> would have spoken every Line of it: If, therefore, in any Part of it I
            succeeded, let the Merit be given to him: And how far I succeeded in that Light, those
            only can be Judges who remember him. In order, therefore, to give you a nearer Idea of
              <hi rend="italic">Sandford,</hi> you must give me leave (compell'd as I am to be vain)
            to tell you that the last Sir <hi rend="italic">John Vanbrugh,</hi> who was an Admirer
            of <hi rend="italic">Sandford,</hi> after <pb n="140" entity="DSSR_000002909_0247"/> he
            had seen me act it, assur'd me That he never knew any one Actor so particularly profit
            by another as I had done by <hi rend="italic">Sandford</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Richard
              the Third: You have,</hi> said he, <hi rend="italic">his very Look, Gesture, Gait,
              Speech, and every Motion of him, and have borrow'd them all only to serve you in that
              Character.</hi> If, therefore, Sir <hi rend="italic">John Vanbrugh</hi>'s Observation
            was just, they who remember me in <hi rend="italic">Richard the Third</hi> may have a
            nearer Conception of <hi rend="italic">Sandford</hi> than from all the critical Account
            I can give of him. <ref target="n140-1" n="162">[140.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>I come now to those other Men Actors, who at this time were equally famous in the lower
            Life of Comedy. But I find myself more at a loss to give you them in their true and
            proper Light, than those I have already set before you. Why the Tragedian warms us into
            Joy or Admiration, or sets our Eyes on flow with Pity, we can easily explain to
            another's Apprehension: But it may sometimes puzzle the <pb n="141"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0248"/> gravest Spectator to account for that familiar Violence
            of Laughter that shall seize him at some particular Strokes of a true Comedian. How then
            shall I describe what a better Judge might not be able to express? The Rules to please
            the Fancy cannot so easily be laid down as those that ought to govern the Judgment. The
            Decency, too, that must be observed in Tragedy, reduces, by the manner of speaking it,
            one Actor to be much more like another than they can or need be supposed to be in
            Comedy: There the Laws of Action give them such free and almost unlimited Liberties to
            play and wanton with Nature, that the Voice, Look, and Gesture of a Comedian may be as
            various as the Manners and Faces of the whole Mankind are different from one another.
            These are the Difficulties I lie under. Where I want Words, therefore, to describe what
            I may commend, I can only hope you will give credit to my Opinion: And this Credit I
            shall most stand in need of, when I tell you, that</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Nokes</hi>
            <ref target="n141-1" n="163">[141.1]</ref> was an Actor of a quite different Genius from
            any I have ever read, heard of, or seen, since or before his Time; and yet his general
            Excellence may be comprehended in one Article, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> a plain <pb
              n="142" entity="DSSR_000002909_0249"/> and palpable Simplicity of Nature, which was so
            utterly his own, that he was often as unaccountably diverting in his common Speech as on
            the Stage. I saw him once giving an Account of some Table-talk to another Actor behind
            the Scenes, which a Man of Quality accidentally listening to, was so deceived by his
            Manner, that he ask'd him if that was a new Play he was rehearsing? It seems almost
            amazing that this Simplicity, so easy to <hi rend="italic">Nokes,</hi> should never be
            caught by any one of his Successors. <hi rend="italic">Leigh</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
              >Underhil</hi> have been well copied, tho' not equall'd by others. But not all the
            mimical Skill of <hi rend="italic">Estcourt</hi> (fam'd as he was for it) tho' he had
            often seen <hi rend="italic">Nokes</hi>, could scarce give us an Idea of him. After this
            perhaps it will be saying less of him, when I own, that though I have still the Sound of
            every Line he spoke in my Ear, (which us'd not to be thought a bad one) yet I have often
            try'd by myself, but in vain, to reach the least distant Likeness of the <hi
              rend="italic">Vis Comica</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Nokes.</hi> Though this may seem
            little to his Praise, it may be negatively saying a good deal to it, because I have
            never seen any one Actor, except himself, whom I could not at least so far imitate as to
            give you a more than tolerable Notion of his manner. But <hi rend="italic">Nokes</hi>
            was so singular a Species, and was so form'd by Nature for the Stage, that I question if
            (beyond the trouble of getting Words by Heart) it ever cost him an Hour's Labour to
            arrive at that high Reputation he had, and deserved.</p>
          <p>The Characters he particularly shone in, were Sir <pb n="143"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0250"/>
            <hi rend="italic">Martin Marr-all, Gomez</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Spanish
            Friar,</hi> Sir <hi rend="italic">Nicolas Cully</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Love in a Tub,</hi>
            <ref target="n143-1" n="164">[143.1]</ref>
            <hi rend="italic">Barnaby Brittle</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Wanton Wife,</hi> Sir
              <hi rend="italic">Davy Dunce</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Soldier's Fortune,
            Sosia</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Amphytrion,</hi>
            <ref target="n143-2" n="165">[143.2]</ref> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. To tell
            you how he acted them is beyond the reach of Criticism: But to tell you what Effect his
            Action had upon the Spectator is not impossible: This then is all you will expect form
            me, and from hence I must leave you to guess at him.</p>
          <p>He scarce ever made his first Entrance in a Play but he was received with an
            involuntary Applause, not of Hands only, for those may be, and have often been partially
            prostituted and bespoken, but by a General Laughter which the very Sight of him provoked
            and Nature cou'd not resist; yet the louder the Laugh the graver was his Look upon it;
            and sure, the ridiculous Solemnity of his Features were enough to have set a whole Bench
            of Bishops into a Titter, cou'd he have been honour'd (may it be no Offence to suppose
            it) with such grave and right reverend Auditors. In the ludicrous Distresses which, by
            the Laws of Comedy, Folly is often involv'd in, he sunk into such a mixture of piteous
            Pusillanimity and a Consternation so ruefully ridiculous and inconsolable, that when he
            had shook you to a Fatigue of Laughter it became a moot point whether you ought not to
            have pity'd him. When he debated <pb n="144" entity="DSSR_000002909_0251"/> any matter
            by himself, he would shut up his Mouth with a dumb studious Powt, and roll his full Eye
            into such a vacant Amazement, such a palpable Ignorance of what to think of it, that his
            silent Perplexity (which would sometimes hold him several Minutes) gave your Imagination
            as full Content as the most absurd thing he could say upon it. In the Character of Sir
              <hi rend="italic">Martin Marr-all,</hi> who is always committing Blunders to the
            Prejudice of his own Interest, when he had brought himself to a Dilemma in his Affairs
            by vainly proceeding upon his own Head, and was afterwards afraid to look his governing
            Servant and Counsellor in the Face, what a copious and distressful Harangue have I seen
            him make with his Looks (while the House has been in one continued Roar for several
            Minutes) before he could prevail with his Courage to speak a Word to him! Then might you
            have at once read in his Face <hi rend="italic">Vexation</hi>&mdash;that his own
            Measures, which he had piqued himself upon, had fail'd. <hi rend="italic"
            >Envy</hi>&mdash;of his Servant's superior Wit&mdash;<hi rend="italic"
            >Distress</hi> &mdash;to retrieve the Occasion he had lost. <hi rend="italic"
            >Shame</hi>&mdash;to confess his Folly; and yet a sullen Desire to be reconciled and
            better advised for the future! What Tragedy ever shew'd us such a Tumult of Passions
            rising at once in one Bosom! or what buskin'd Heroe standing under the Load of them
            could have more effectually mov'd his Spectators by the most pathetick Speech, than poor
            miserable <hi rend="italic">Nokes</hi> did by this silent Eloquence and piteous Plight
            of his Features.</p>
          <pb n="145" entity="DSSR_000002909_0252"/>
          <p>His Person was of the middle size, his Voice clear and audible; his natural Countenance
            grave and sober; but the Moment he spoke the settled Seriousness of his Features was
            utterly discharg'd, and a dry, drolling, or laughing Levity took such full Possession of
            him that I can only refer the Idea of him to your Imagination. In some of his low
            Characters, that became it, he had a shuffling Shamble in his Gait, with so contented an
            Ignorance in his Aspect and an aukward Absurdity in his Gesture, that he you not known
            him, you could not have believ'd that naturally he could have had a Grain of common
            Sense. In a Word, I am tempted to sum up the Character of <hi rend="italic">Nokes</hi>,
            as a Comedian, in a Parodie of what <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi>'s <hi
              rend="italic">Mark Antony</hi> says of <hi rend="italic">Brutus</hi> as a Hero.</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l><hi rend="italic">His Life was Laughter, and the</hi> Ludicrous</l>
            <l>
              <hi rend="italic">So mixt in him, that Nature might stand up</hi>
            </l>
            <l><hi rend="italic">And say to all the World&mdash;This was an</hi> Actor.<ref

          </lg>




          <p><hi rend="italic">Leigh</hi> was of the mercurial kind, and though not so strict an
            Observer of Nature, yet never so wanton in his Performance as to be wholly out of her
            Sight. In Humour he lov'd to take a full Career, but was careful enough to stop short
            when just upon the Precipice: He had great Variety in his manner, and was famous in very
            different Characters: In the canting, grave Hypocrisy of the <hi rend="italic"
            >Spanish</hi> Friar he stretcht the Veil of Piety so thinly over him, that in <pb
              n="146" entity="DSSR_000002909_0253"/> every Look, Word, and Motion you saw a
            palpable, wicked Slyness shine through it&mdash;Here he kept his Vivacity demurely
            confin'd till the pretended Duty of his Function demanded it, and then he exerted it
            with a cholerick sacerdotal Insolence. But the Friar is a Character of such glaring Vice
            and so strongly drawn, that a very indifferent Actor cannot but hit upon the broad Jests
            that are remarkable in every Scene of it. Though I have never yet seen any one that has
            fill'd them with half the Truth and Spirit of <hi rend="italic">Leigh</hi>&mdash;<hi
              rend="italic">Leigh</hi> rais'd the Character as much above the Poet's Imagination as
            the Character has sometimes rais'd other Actors above themselves! and I do not doubt but
            the Poet's Knowledge of <hi rend="italic">Leigh</hi>'s Genius help'd him to many a
            pleasant Stroke of Nature, which without that Knowledge never might have enter'd into
            his Conception. <hi rend="italic">Leigh</hi> was so eminent in this Character that the
            late Earl of <hi rend="italic">Dorset</hi> (who was equally an Admirer and a Judge of
            Theatrical Merit) had a whole Length of him, in the Friar's Habit, drawn by <hi
              rend="italic">Kneller:</hi> The whole Portrait is highly painted, and extremely like
            him. But no wonder <hi rend="italic">Leigh</hi> arriv'd to such Fame in what was so
            compleatly written for him, when Characters that would make the Reader yawn in the
            Closet, have, by the Strength of his Action, been lifted into the lowdest Laughter on
            the Stage. Of this kind was the Scrivener's great boobily Son in the <hi rend="italic"
              >Villain;</hi>
            <ref target="n146-1" n="167">[146.1]</ref>

            <hi rend="italic">Ralph,</hi> a stupid, staring Under-servant, in Sir <hi rend="italic"
              >Solomon Single.</hi>
            <ref target="n147-1" n="168">[147.1]</ref> Quite opposite to those were Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Jolly Jumble</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Soldier's Fortune,</hi>
            <ref target="n147-2" n="169">[147.2]</ref> and his old <hi rend="italic">Belfond</hi> in
            the <hi rend="italic">Squire</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Alsatia.</hi>
            <ref target="n147-3" n="170">[147.3]</ref> In Sir <hi rend="italic">Jolly</hi> he was
            all Life and laughing Humour, and when <hi rend="italic">Nokes</hi> acted <pb n="148"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0259"/> with him in the same Play, they returned the Ball so
            dexterously upon one another, that every Scene between them seem'd but one continued
            Rest <ref target="n148-1" n="171">[148.1]</ref> of Excellence &mdash;-But alas! when
            those Actors were gone, that Comedy and many others, for the same Reason, were rarely
            known to stand upon their own Legs; by seeing no more of <hi rend="italic">Leigh</hi> or
              <hi rend="italic">Nokes</hi> in them, the Characters were quite sunk and alter'd. In
            his Sir <hi rend="italic">William Belfond, Leigh</hi> shew'd a more spirited Variety
            than ever I saw any Actor, in any one Character, some up to: The Poet, 'tis true, had
            here exactly chalked for him the Out-lines of Nature; but the high Colouring, the strong
            Lights and Shades of Humour that enliven'd the whole and struck our Admiration with
            Surprize and Delight, were wholly owing to the Actor. The easy Reader might, perhaps,
              <pb n="149" entity="DSSR_000002909_0260"/> have been pleased with the Author without
            discomposing a Feature, but the Spectator must have heartily held his Sides, or the
            Actor would have heartily made them ach for it.</p>
          <p>Now, though I observ'd before that <hi rend="italic">Nokes</hi> never was tolerably
            touch'd by any of his Successors, yet in this Character I must own I have seen <hi
              rend="italic">Leigh</hi> extremely well imitated by my late facetious Friend <hi
              rend="italic">Penkethman,</hi> who, tho' far short of what was inimitable in the
            Original, yet, as to the general Resemblance, was a very valuable Copy of him: And, as I
            know <hi rend="italic">Penkethman</hi> cannot yet be out of your Memory, I have chosen
            to mention him here, to give you the nearest Idea I can of the Excellence of <hi
              rend="italic">Leigh</hi> in that particular Light: For <hi rend="italic">Leigh</hi>
            had many masterly Variations which the other cou'd not, nor ever pretended to reach,
            particularly in the Dotage and Follies of extreme old Age, in the Characters of <hi
              rend="italic">Fumble</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Fond Husband,</hi>
            <ref target="n149-1" n="172">[149.1]</ref> and the Toothless Lawyer <ref target="n149-2"
              n="173">[149.2]</ref> in the <hi rend="italic">City Politicks,</hi> both which Plays
            liv'd only by the extraordinary Performance of <hi rend="italic">Nokes</hi> and <hi
              rend="italic">Leigh.</hi></p>
          <p>There were two other Characters of the farcical kind, <hi rend="italic">Geta</hi> in
            the <hi rend="italic">Prophetess,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Crack</hi> in Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Courtly Nice,</hi> which, as they are less confin'd to Nature, the
            Imitation of them was less difficult to <pb n="150" entity="DSSR_000002909_0261"/>
            <hi rend="italic">Penkethman,</hi>
            <ref target="n150-1" n="174">[150.1]</ref> who, to say the Truth, delighted more in the
            whimsical than the natural; therefore, when I say he sometimes resembled <hi
              rend="italic">Leigh</hi>, I reserve this Distinction on his Master's side, that the
            pleasant Extravagancies of <hi rend="italic">Leigh</hi> were all the Flowers of his own
            Fancy, while the less fertile Brain of my Friend was contented to make use of the Stock
            his Predecessor had left him. What I have said, therefore, is not to detract from honest
              <hi rend="italic">Pinky</hi>'s Merit, but to do Justice to his
            Predecessor&mdash;And though, 'tis true, we as seldom see a good Actor as a great
            Poet arise from the bare <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi> of another's Genius, yet if
            this be a general Rule, <hi rend="italic">Penkethman</hi> was the nearest to an
            Exception from it; for with those who never knew <hi rend="italic">Leigh</hi> he might
            very well have pass'd for a more than common Original. Yet again, as my Partiality for
              <hi rend="italic">Penkethman</hi> ought not to lead me from Truth, I must beg leave
            (though out of its Place) to tell you fairly what was the best of him, that the
            superiority of <hi rend="italic">Leigh</hi> may stand in its due Light&mdash; <hi
              rend="italic">Penkethman</hi> had certainly from Nature a great deal of comic Power
            about him, but his Judgment was by no means equal to it; for he would make frequent
            Deviations into the Whimsies of an <hi rend="italic">Harlequin.</hi> By the way, (let me
            digress a little farther) whatever Allowances are made for the Licence of that
            Character, I mean of an <hi rend="italic">Harlequin,</hi> whatever Pretences may be
            urged, from the Practice of the ancient Comedy, for its being play'd in a Mask,
            resembling <pb n="151" entity="DSSR_000002909_0262"/> no part of the human Species, I am
            apt to think the best Excuse a modern Actor can plead for his continuing it, is that the
            low, senseless, and monstrous things he says and does in it no theatrical Assurance
            could get through with a bare Face: Let me give you an Instance of even <hi
              rend="italic">Penkethman</hi>'s being out of Countenance for want of it: When he first
            play'd <hi rend="italic">Harlequin</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Emperor</hi> of the <hi
              rend="italic">Moon</hi>, <ref target="n151-1" n="175">[151.1]</ref> several Gentlemen
            (who inadvertently judg'd by the Rules of Nature) fancied that a great deal of the
            Drollery and Spirit of his Grimace was lost by his wearing that useless, unmeaning
            Masque of a black Cate, and therefore insisted that the next time of his acting that
            Part he should play without it: Their Desire was accordingly comply'd
            with&mdash;but, alas! in vain &mdash;<hi rend="italic">Penkethman</hi> could not
            take to himself the Shame of the Character without being concealed&mdash;he was no
            more <hi rend="italic">Harlequin</hi>&mdash;his Humour was quite disconcerted! his
            Conscience could not with the same <hi rend="italic">Effronterie</hi> declare against
            Nature without the cover of that unchanging Face, which he was sure would never blush
            for it! no! it was quite another Case! <pb n="152" entity="DSSR_000002909_0263"/>
            without that Armour his Courage could not come up to the bold Strokes that were
            necessary to get the better of common Sense. Now if this Circumstance will justify the
            Modesty of <hi rend="italic">Penkethman,</hi> it cannot but throw a wholesome Contempt
            on the low Merit of an <hi rend="italic">Harlequin.</hi> But how farther necessary the
            Masque is to that Fool's Coat, we have lately had a stronger Proof in the Favour that
            the <hi rend="italic">Harlequin Sauvage</hi> met with at <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>,
            and the ill Fate that followed the same <hi rend="italic">Sauvage</hi> when he pull'd
            off his Masque in <hi rend="italic">London.</hi>
            <ref target="n152-1" n="176">[152.1]</ref> So that it seems what was Wit from an <hi
              rend="italic">Harlequin</hi> was something too extravagant from a human Creature. If,
            therefore, <hi rend="italic">Penkethman</hi> in Characters drawn from Nature might
            sometimes launch out into a few gamesome Liberties which would not have been excused
            from a more correct Comedian, yet, in his manner of taking them, he always seem'd to me
            in a kind of Consciousness of the Hazard he was running, as if he fairly confess'd that
            what he did was only as well as he <hi rend="italic">could</hi> do&mdash;That he was
            willing to take his Chance for Success, but if he did not meet with it a Rebuke should
            break no Squares; <pb n="153" entity="DSSR_000002909_0264"/> he would mend it another
            time, and would take whatever pleas'd his Judges to think of him in good part; and I
            have often thought that a good deal of the Favour he met with was owing to this seeming
            humble way of waving all Pretences to Merit but what the Town would please to allow him.
            What confirms me in this Opinion is, that when it has been his ill Fortune to meet with
            a <hi rend="italic">Disgraccia,</hi> I have known him say apart to himself, yet loud
            enough to be heard&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Odso!</hi> I believe I <hi rend="italic"
              >am</hi> a <hi rend="italic">little wrong here!</hi> which once was so well receiv'd
            by the Audience that they turn'd their Reproof into Applause. <ref target="n153-1"
              n="177">[153.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>Now, the Judgment of <hi rend="italic">Leigh</hi> always guarded the happier Sallies of
            his Fancy from the least Hazard of Disapprobation: he seem'd not to court, but to <pb
              n="154" entity="DSSR_000002909_0265"/> attack your Applause, and always came off
            victorious; nor did his highest Assurance amount to any more than that just Confidence
            without which the commendable Spirit of every good Actor must be abated; and of this
            Spirit <hi rend="italic">Leigh</hi> was a most perfect Master. He was much admir'd by
            King <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi>, who us'd to distinguish him when spoke of by the
            Title of <hi rend="italic">his Actor:</hi> Which however makes me imagine that in his
            Exile that Prince might have receiv'd his first Impression of good Actors from the <hi
              rend="italic">French</hi> Stage; for <hi rend="italic">Leigh</hi> had more of that
            farcical Vivacity than <hi rend="italic">Nokes;</hi> but <hi rend="italic">Nokes</hi>
            was never languid by his more strict Adherence to Nature, and as far as my Judgment is
            worth taking, if their intrinsick Merit could be justly weigh'd, <hi rend="italic"
            >Nokes</hi> must have had the better in the Balance. Upon the unfortunate Death of <hi
              rend="italic">Monfort, Leigh</hi> fell ill of a Fever, and dy'd in a Week after him,
            in <hi rend="italic">December</hi> 1692. <ref target="n154-1" n="178">[154.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p><hi rend="italic">Underhil</hi> was a correct and natural Comedian, his particular
            Excellence was in Characters that may be called Still-life, I mean the Stiff, the Heavy,
            and the Stupid; to these he gave the exactest and most expressive Colours, and in some
            of them look'd as if it were not in the Power of human Passions to alter a Feature of
            him. In the solemn Formality of <hi rend="italic">Obadiah</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"
              >Committee</hi>, and in the boobily Heaviness of <hi rend="italic">Lolpoop</hi> in the
              <hi rend="italic">Squire of Alsatia,</hi> he seem'd the immoveable Log he stood for! a
            Countenance of Wood could not be more fixt than his, when the <pb n="155"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0266"/> Blockhead of a Character required it: His Face was full
            and long; from his Crown to the end of his Nose was the shorter half of it, so that the
            Disproportion of his lower Features, when soberly compos'd, with an unwandering Eye
            hanging over them, threw him into the most lumpish, moping Mortal that ever made
            Beholders merry! not but at other times he could be wakened into Spirit equally
            ridiculous &mdash;In the course, rustick Humour of Justice <hi rend="italic"
              >Clodpate,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Epsome Wells,</hi>
            <ref target="n155-1" n="179">[155.1]</ref> he was a delightful Brute! and in the blunt
            Vivacity of Sir <hi rend="italic">Sampson,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Love for Love,</hi>
            he shew'd all that true perverse Spirit that is commonly seen in much Wit and
            Ill-nature. This Character is one of those few so well written, with so much Wit and
            Humour, that an Actor must be the grossest Dunce that does not appear with an unusual
            Life in it: But it will still shew as great a Proportion of Skill to come near <hi
              rend="italic">Underhil</hi> in the acting it, which (not to undervalue those who soon
            came after him) I have not yet seen. He was particularly admir'd too for the
            Grave-digger in <hi rend="italic">Hamlet.</hi> The Author of the <hi rend="italic"
              >Tatler</hi> recommends him to the Favour of the Town upon that Play's being acted for
            his Benefit, wherein, after his Age had some Years oblig'd him to leave the Stage, he
            came on again, for that Day, to perform his old Part; <ref target="n155-2" n="180"
              >[155.2]</ref> but, <pb n="156" entity="DSSR_000002909_0267"/> alas! so worn and
            disabled, as if himself was to have lain in the Grave he was digging; when he could no
            more excite Laughter, his Infirmities were dismiss'd with Pity: He dy'd soon after, a
            superannuated Pensioner in the List of those who were supported by the joint Sharers
            under the first Patent granted to Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard Steele.</hi></p>
          <p>The deep Impressions of these excellent Actors which I receiv'd in my Youth, I am
            afraid may have drawn me into the common Foible of us old Fellows; which is a Fondness,
            and perhaps a tedious Partiality, for the Pleasures we have formerly tasted, and think
            are now fallen off because we can no longer enjoy them. If therefore I lie under that
            Suspicion, tho' I have related nothing incredible or out of the reach of a good Judge's
            Conception, I <pb n="157" entity="DSSR_000002909_0268"/> must appeal to those Few who
            are about my own Age for the Truth and Likeness of these Theatrical Portraicts.</p>
          <p>There were at this time several others in some degree of Favour with the Publick, <hi
              rend="italic">Powel,</hi>
            <ref target="n157-1" n="181">[157.1]</ref>
            <hi rend="italic">Verbruggen,</hi><ref target="n157-2" n="182">[157.2]</ref>
            <hi rend="italic">Williams,</hi>
            <ref target="n157-3" n="183">[157.3]</ref> &amp;c. But as I cannot think their best
            Improvements made them in any wise equal to those I have spoke of, I ought not to range
            them in the same Class. Neither were <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
              >Dogget</hi> yet come to the Stage; nor was <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> initiated
            till about six Years after them; or Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi> known till the
            Year 1700. I must therefore reserve the four last for their proper Period, and proceed
            to the Actresses that were famous <pb n="158" entity="DSSR_000002909_0269"/> with <hi
              rend="italic">Betterton</hi> at the latter end of the last Century.</p>
          <p>Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Berry</hi> was then in possession of almost all the chief Parts
            in Tragedy: With what Skill she gave Life to them you will judge from the Words of <hi
              rend="italic">Dryden</hi> in his Preface to <hi rend="italic">Cleomenes,</hi>
            <ref target="n158-1" n="184">[158.1]</ref> where he says,</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Mrs.</hi> Barry, <hi rend="italic">always excellent, has in this
              Tragedy excell'd herself, and gain'd a Reputation beyond any Woman I have ever seen on
              the Theatre.</hi></p>
          <p>I very perfectly remember her acting that Part; and however unnecessary it may seem to
            give my Judgment after <hi rend="italic">Dryden</hi>'s, I cannot help saying I do not
            only close with his Opinion, but will venture to add that (tho' <hi rend="italic"
            >Dryden</hi> has been dead these Thirty Eight Years) the same Compliment to this Hour
            may be due to her Excellence. And tho' she was then not a little past her Youth, she was
            not till that time fully arriv'd to her maturity of Power and Judgment: Form whence I
            would observe, That the short Life of Beauty is not long enough to form a complete
            Actress. In Men the Delicacy of Person is not so absolutely necessary, nor the Decline
            of it so soon taken notice of. The Fame Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Barry</hi> arriv'd to is
            a particular Proof of the Difficulty there is in judging with Certainty, from their
            first Trials, whether young People will ever make <pb n="159"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0270"/> any great Figure on a Theatre. There was, it seems, so
            little Hope of Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Barry</hi> at her first setting out, that she was
            at the end of the first Year discharg'd the Company, among others that were thought to
            be a useless Expence to it. I take it for granted that the Objection to Mrs. <hi
              rend="italic">Barry</hi> at that time must have been a defective Ear, or some
            unskilful Dissonance in her manner of pronouncing: But where there is a proper Voice and
            Person, with the Addition of a good Understanding, Experience tells us that such Defect
            is not always invincible; of which not only Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Barry</hi>, but the
            late Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi> are eminent Instances. Mrs. <hi rend="italic"
              >Oldfield</hi> had been a Year in the Theatre-Royal before she was observ'd to give
            any tolerable Hope of her being an Actress; so unlike to all manner of Propriety was her
            Speaking! <ref target="n159-1" n="185">[159.1]</ref> How unaccountably, then does a
            Genius for the Stage make its way towards Perfection? For, notwithstanding these equal
            Disadvantages, both these Actresses, tho' of different Excellence, made themselves
            complete Mistresses of their Art by the Prevalence of their Understanding. If this
            Observation may be of any use to the Masters of future Theatres, I shall not then have
            made it to no purpose. <ref target="n159-2" n="186">[159.2]</ref>
          </p>

          <pb n="160" entity="DSSR_000002909_0271"/>
          <p> Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Barry</hi>, in Characters of Greatness, had a Presence of
            elevated Dignity, her Mien and Motion superb and gracefully majestick; her Voice full,
            clear, and strong, so that no Violence of Passion could be too much for her: And when
            Distress or Tenderness possess'd her, she subsided into the most affecting Melody and
            Softness. In the Art of exciting Pity she had a Power beyond all the Actresses I have
            yet seen, or what your Imagination can conceive. Of the former of these two great
            Excellencies she gave the most delightful Proofs in almost all the Heroic Plays of <hi
              rend="italic">Dryden</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lee;</hi> and of the latter, in the
            softer Passions of <hi rend="italic">Otway's Monimia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
              >Belvidera.</hi>
            <ref target="n160-1" n="187">[160.1]</ref> In scenes of Anger, Defiance, or Resentment,
            while she was impetuous and terrible, she pour'd out the Sentiment with an enchanting
            Harmony; and it was this particular Excellence for which <hi rend="italic">Dryden</hi>
            made her the above-recited Compliment upon her acting <hi rend="italic">Cassandra</hi>
            in his <hi rend="italic">Cleomenes.</hi> But here I am apt to think his Partiality for
            that Character may have tempted his Judgment to let it pass for her Master-piece, when
            he could not but know there were several other Characters in which her Action might have
            given her a fairer Pretence to the Praise he has bestow'd on her for <hi rend="italic"
              >Cassandra;</hi> for in no Part of that is there the least ground for Compassion, as
            in <hi rend="italic">Monimia,</hi> nor equal cause for Admiration, as in the nobler Love
            of <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra,</hi> or the <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0272"/>

            <ref target="n161-1" n="188">[161.1]</ref> 'Twas in these Lights I thought Mrs. <hi
              rend="italic">Barry</hi> shone with a much brighter Excellence than in <hi
              rend="italic">Cassandra.</hi> She was the first Person whose Merit was distinguish'd
            by the Indulgence of having an annual Benefit-Play, which was granted to her alone, if I
            mistake not, first in King <hi rend="italic">James</hi>'s time, <ref target="n161-2"
              n="189">[161.2]</ref> and which became not common to others 'till the Division of this
            Company after the Death of King <hi rend="italic">William</hi>'s Queen <hi rend="italic"

          <p>Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Betterton,</hi> tho' far advanc'd in Years, was so <pb n="162"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0277"/> great a Mistress of Nature that even Mrs. <hi
              rend="italic">Barry</hi>, who acted the Lady <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> after her,
            could not in that Part, with all her superior Strength and Melody of Voice, throw out
            those quick and careless Strokes of Terror from the Disorder of a guilty Mind, which the
            other gave us with a Facility in her Manner that render'd them at once tremendous and
            delightful. Time could not impair her Skill, tho' he had brought her Person to decay.
            She was, to the last, the Admiration of all true Judges of Nature and Lovers of <hi
              rend="italic">Shakespear,</hi> in whose Plays she chiefly excell'd, and without a
            Rival. When she quitted the Stage several good Actresses were the better for her
            Instruction. She was a Woman of an unblemish'd and sober life, and had the Honour to
            teach Queen <hi rend="italic">Anne,</hi> when Princess, the Part of <hi rend="italic"
              >Semandra</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Mithridates,</hi> which she acted at Court in King
              <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi>'s time. After the Death of Mr. <hi rend="italic"
              >Betterton</hi>, her Husband, that Princess, when Queen, order'd her a Pension for
            Life, but she liv'd not to receive more than the first half Year of it. <ref

          <p>Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Leigh,</hi> the Wife of <hi rend="italic">Leigh</hi> already
            mention'd, had a very droll way of dressing the pretty Foibles of superannuated
            Beauties. She had in her self a good deal of Humour, and knew how to infuse it <pb
              n="163" entity="DSSR_000002909_0278"/> into the affected Mothers, Aunts, and modest
            stale Maids that had miss'd their Market; of this sort were the Modish Mother in the <hi
              rend="italic">Chances,</hi> affecting to be politely commode for her own Daughter; the
            Coquette Prude of an Aunt in Sir <hi rend="italic">Courtly Nice,</hi> who prides herself
            in being chaste and cruel at Fifty; and the languishing Lady <hi rend="italic"
            >Wishfort</hi> in <hi rend="italic">The Way of the World:</hi> In all these, with many
            others, she was extremely entertaining, and painted in a lively manner the blind Side of
            Nature. <ref target="n163-1" n="192">[163.1]</ref>

          <p>Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Butler,</hi> who had her Christian Name of <hi rend="italic"
              >Charlotte</hi> given her by King <hi rend="italic">Charles,</hi> was the Daughter of
            a decay'd Knight, and had the Honour of that Prince's Recommendation to the Theatre; a
            provident Restitution, giving to the Stage in kind what he had sometimes taken from it:
            The Publick at least was oblig'd by it; for she prov'd not only a good Actress, but was
            allow'd in those Days to sing and dance to great Perfection. In the Dramatick Operas of
              <hi rend="italic">Dioclesian</hi> and that of <hi rend="italic">King Arthur,</hi> she
              <pb n="164" entity="DSSR_000002909_0279"/> was a capital and admired Performer. In
            speaking, too, she had a sweet-ton'd Voice, which, with her naturally genteel Air and
            sensible Pronunciation, render'd her wholly Mistress of the Amiable in many serious
            Characters. In Parts of Humour, too, she had a manner of blending her assuasive Softness
            even with the Gay, the Lively, and the Alluring. Of this she gave an agreeable Instance
            in her Action of the (<hi rend="italic">Villiers</hi>) Duke of <hi rend="italic"
              >Buckingham</hi>'s second <hi rend="italic">Constantia</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"

            do no wrong to the late Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi>'s lively Performance of the
            same Character. Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi>'s Fame may spare Mrs. <hi

          <p>Here I cannot help observing, when there was but one Theatre in <hi rend="italic"
              >London</hi>, at what unequal Sallaries, compar'd to those of late Days, the hired
            Actors were then held by the absolute Authority of their frugal Masters the Patentees;
            for Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Butler</hi> had then but Forty Shillings a Week, and could
            she have <pb n="165" entity="DSSR_000002909_0280"/> obtain'd an Addition of Ten
            Shillings more (which was refus'd her) would never have left their Service; but being
            offer'd her own Conditions to go with Mr. <hi rend="italic">Ashbury</hi>
            <ref target="n165-1" n="194">[165.1]</ref> to <hi rend="italic">Dublin</hi> (who was
            then raising a Company of Actors for that Theatre, where there had been none since the
            Revolution) her Discontent here prevail'd with he to accept of his Offer, and he found
            his Account in her Value. Were not those Patentees most sagacious Oeconomists that could
            lay hold on so notable an Expedient to lessen their Charge? How gladly, in my time of
            being a Sharer, would we have given four times her Income to an Actress of equal Merit?</p>
          <p>Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Monfort,</hi> whose second Marriage gave her the Name of <hi
              rend="italic">Verbruggen,</hi> was Mistress of more variety of Humour than I ever knew
            in any one Woman Actress. This variety, too, was attended with an equal Vivacity, which
            made her excellent in Characters extremely different. As she was naturally a pleasant
            Mimick, she had the Skill to make <pb n="166" entity="DSSR_000002909_0281"/> that Talent
            useful on the Stage, a Talent which may be surprising in a Conversation and yet be lost
            when brought to the Theatre, which was the Case of <hi rend="italic">Estcourt</hi>
            already mention'd: But where the Elocution is round, distinct, voluble, and various, as
            Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Monfort</hi>'s was, the Mimick there is a great Assistant to the
            Actor. Nothing, tho' ever so barren, if within the Bounds of Nature, could be flat in
            her Hands She gave many heightening Touches to Characters but coldly written, and often
            made an Author vain of his Work that in it self had but little Merit. She was so fond of
            Humour, in what low Part soever to be found, that she would make no scruple of defacing
            her fair Form to come heartily into it; <ref target="n166-1" n="195">[166.1]</ref> for
            when she was eminent in several desirable Characters of Wit and Humour in higher Life,
            she would be in as much Fancy when descending into the antiquated <hi rend="italic"
              >Abigail</hi>
            <ref target="n166-2" n="196">[166.2]</ref> of <hi rend="italic">Fletcher</hi>, as when
            triumphing in all the Airs and vain Graces of a fine Lady; a Merit that few Actresses
            care for. In a Play of <hi rend="italic">D'urfey</hi>'s, now forgotten, call'd <hi
              rend="italic">The Western Lass,</hi>
            <ref target="n166-3" n="197">[166.3]</ref> which Part she acted, she transform'd her
            whole Being, Body, Shape, Voice, Language, Look, and Features, into almost <pb n="167"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0282"/> another Animal, with a strong <hi rend="italic"
              >Devonshire</hi> Dialect, a broad laughing Voice, a poking Head, round Shoulders, an
            unconceiving Eye, and the most bediz'ning, dowdy Dress that ever cover'd the untrain'd
            Limbs of a <hi rend="italic">Joan Trot.</hi> To have seen her here you would have
            thought it impossible the same Creature could ever have been recover'd to what was as
            easy to her, the Gay, the Lively, and the Desirable. Nor was her Humour limited to her
            Sex; for, while her Shape permitted, she was a more adroit pretty Fellow than is usually
            seen upon the Stage: Her easy Air, Action, Mien, and Gesture quite chang'd from the
            Quoif to the cock'd Hat and Cavalier in Fashion. <ref target="n167-1" n="198"
            >[167.1]</ref> People were so fond of seeing her a Man, that when the Part of <hi
              rend="italic">Bays</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Rehearsal</hi> had for some time lain
            dormant, she was desired to take it up, which I have seen her act with all the true
            coxcombly Spirit and Humour that the Sufficiency of the Character required.</p>
          <p>But what found most Employment for her whole various Excellence at once, was the Part
            of <hi rend="italic">Melantha</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Marriage-Alamode.</hi>
            <ref target="n167-2" n="199">[167.2]</ref>
            <hi rend="italic">Melantha</hi> is as finish'd an Impertinent as ever flutter'd in a
            Drawing-Room, and seems to contain the most compleat System of Female Foppery that could
            possibly be crowded into <pb n="168" entity="DSSR_000002909_0283"/> the tortured Form of
            a Fine Lady. Her Language, Dress, Motion, Manners, Soul, and Body, are in a continual
            Hurry to be something more than is necessary or commendable. And though I doubt it will
            be a vain Labour to offer you a just Likeness of Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Monfort</hi>'s
            Action, yet the fantastick Impression is still so strong in my Memory that I cannot help
            saying something, tho' fantastically, about it. The firs ridiculous Airs that break from
            her are upon a Gallant never seen before, who delivers her a Letter from her Father
            recommending him to her good Graces as an honourable Lover. <ref target="n168-1" n="200"
              >[168.1]</ref> Here now, one would think, she might naturally shew a little of the
            Sexe's decent Reserve, tho' never so slightly cover'd! No, Sir; not a Tittle of it;
            Modesty is the Virtue of a poor-soul'd Country Gentlewoman; she is too much a Court Lady
            to be under so vulgar a Confusion; she reads the Letter, therefore, with a careless,
            dropping Lip and an erected Brow, humming it hastily over as if she were impatient to
            outgo her Father's Commands by making a compleat Conquest of him at once; and that the
            Letter might not embarrass her Attack, crack! she crumbles it at once into her Palm and
            pours upon him her whole Artillery of Airs, Eyes, and Motion; down goes her dainty,
            diving Body to the Ground, as if she were sinking under the conscious Load of her own
            Attractions; then launches into a Flood of fine Language <pb n="169"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0284"/> and Compliment, still playing her Chest forward in
            fifty Falls and Risings, like a Swan upon waving Water; and, to complete her
            Impertinence, she is so rapidly fond of her own Wit that she will not give her Lover
            Leave to praise it: Silent assenting Bows and vain Endeavours to speak are all the share
            of the Conversation he is admitted to, which at last he is relieved from by her
            Engagement to half a Score Visits, which she <hi rend="italic">swims</hi> from him to
            make, with a Promise to return in a Twinkling.</p>
          <p>If this Sketch has Colour enough to give you any near Conception of her, I then need
            only tell you that throughout the whole Character of her variety of Humour was every way
            proportionable; as, indeed, in most Parts that she thought worth her care of that had
            the least Matter for her Fancy to work upon, I may justly say, That no Actress, from her
            own Conception, could have heighten'd them with more lively Strokes of Nature. <ref
              target="n169-1" n="201">[169.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <pb n="170" entity="DSSR_000002909_0285"/>

          <p>I come now to the last, and only living Person, of all those whose Theatrical
            Characters I have promised you, Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Bracegirdle;</hi> who, I know,
            would rather pass her remaining Days forgotten as an Actress, than to have her Youth
            recollected in the most favourable Light I am able to place it; yet, as she is
            essentially necessary to my Theatrical History, and as I only bring her back to the
            Company of those with whom she pass'd the Spring and Summer of her Life, I hope it will
            excuse the Liberty I take in commemorating the Delight which the Publick received from
            her Appearance while she was an Ornament to the Theatre.</p>

          <p>Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Bracegirdle</hi> was now but just blooming to her Maturity; her
            Reputation as an Actress gradually rising with that of her Person; never any Woman was
            in such general Favour of her Spectators, which, to the last Scene of her Dramatick
            Life, she maintain'd by not being unguarded in her private Character. <ref
              target="n170-1" n="202">[170.1]</ref> This Discretion contributed not a little to <pb
              n="171" entity="DSSR_000002909_0286"/> make her the <hi rend="italic">Cara</hi>, the
            Darling of the Theatre: For it will be no extravagant thing to say, Scarce an Audience
            saw her that were less than half of them Lovers, without a suspected Favourite among
            them: <pb n="172" entity="DSSR_000002909_0287"/> And tho' she might be said to have been
            the Universal Passion, and under the highest Temptations, her Constancy in resisting
            them served but to increase the number of her Admirers: And this perhaps you will more
            easily believe when I extend not my Encomiums on her Person beyond a Sincerity that can
            be suspected; for she had no greater Claim to Beauty than what the most desirable <hi
              rend="italic">Brunette</hi> might pretend to. But her Youth and lively Aspect threw
            out such a Glow of Health and Chearfulness, that on the Stage few Spectators that were
            not past it could behold her without Desire. It was even a Fashion among the Gay and
            Young to have a Taste or <hi rend="italic">Tendre</hi> for Mrs. <hi rend="italic"
              >Bracegirdle.</hi> She inspired the best Authors to write for her, and two of them,
              <ref target="n172-1" n="203">[172.1]</ref> when they gave her a Lover in a Play,
            seem'd palpably to plead their own Passions, and make their private Court to her in <pb
              n="173" entity="DSSR_000002909_0288"/> fictitious Characters. In all the chief Parts
            she acted, the Desirable was so predominant, that no Judge could be cold enough to
            consider from what other particular Excellence she became delightful. To speak
            critically of an Actress that was extremely good were as hazardous as to be positive in
            one's Opinion of the best Opera Singer. People often judge by Comparison where there is
            no Similitude in the Performance. So that, in this case, we have only Taste to appeal
            to, and of Taste there can be no disputing. I shall therefore only say of Mrs. <hi
              rend="italic">Bracegirdle,</hi> That the most eminent Authors always chose her for
            their favourite Character, and shall leave that uncontestable Proof of her Merit to its
            own Value. Yet let me say, there were two very different Characters in which she
            acquitted herself with uncommon Applause: If any thing could excuse that desperate
            Extravagance of Love, that almost frantick Passion of <hi rend="italic">Lee</hi>'s <hi
              rend="italic">Alexander the Great,</hi> it must have been when Mrs. <hi rend="italic"
              >Bracegirdle</hi> was his <hi rend="italic">Statira:</hi> As when she acted <hi
              rend="italic">Millamant</hi>
            <ref target="n173-1" n="204">[173.1]</ref> all the Faults, Follies, and Affectations of
            that agreeable Tyrant were venially melted down into so many Charms and Attractions of a
            conscious Beauty. In other Characters, where Singing was a necessary Part of them, her
            Voice and Action gave a Pleasure which good Sense, in those Days, was not asham'd to
            give Praise to.</p>
          <p>She retir'd from the Stage in the Height of her <pb n="174"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0289"/> Favour from the Publick, when most of her Cotemporaries
            whom she had been bred up with were declining, in the Year 1710, <ref target="n174-1"
              n="205">[174.1]</ref> nor could she be persuaded to return to it under new Masters
            upon the most advantageous Terms that were offered her; excepting one Day, about a Year
            after, to assist her good Friend Mr. <hi rend="italic">Betterton,</hi> when she play'd
              <hi rend="italic">Angelica</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Love for Love</hi> for his
            Benefit. She has still the Happiness to retain her usual Chearfulness, and to be,
            without the transitory Charm of Youth, agreeable. <ref target="n174-2" n="206"
            >[174.2]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>If, in my Account of these memorable Actors, I <pb n="175" entity="DSSR_000002909_0290"
            /> have not deviated from Truth, which, in the least Article, I am not conscious of, may
            we not venture to say, They had not their Equals, at any one Time, upon any Theatre in
              <hi rend="italic">Europe?</hi> Or, if we confine the Comparison to that of <hi
              rend="italic">France</hi> alone, I believe no other Stage can be much disparag'd by
            being left out of the question; which cannot properly be decided by the single Merit of
            any one Actor; whether their <hi rend="italic">Baron</hi> or our <hi rend="italic"
              >Betterton</hi> might be the Superior, (take which Side you please) that Point
            reaches, either way, but to a thirteenth part of what I contend for, <hi rend="italic"
              >viz.</hi> That no Stage, at any one Period, could shew thirteen Actors, standing all
            in equal Lights of Excellence in their Profession: And I am the bolder, in this
            Challenge to any other Nation, because no Theatre having so extended a <pb n="176"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0291"/> Variety of natural Characters as the <hi rend="italic"
              >English</hi>, can have a Demand for Actors of such various Capacities; why then,
            where they could not be equally wanted, should we suppose them, at any one time, to have
            existed?</p>
          <p>How imperfect soever this copious Account of them may be, I am not without Hope, at
            least, it may in some degree shew what Talents are requisite to make Actors valuable:
            And if that may any ways inform or assist the Judgment of future Spectators, it may as
            often be of service to their publick Entertainments; for as their Hearers are, so will
            Actors be; worse, or better, as the false or true Taste applauds or discommends them.
            Hence only can our Theatres improve or must degenerate.</p>
          <p>There is another Point, relating to the hard Condition of those who write for the
            Stage, which I would recommend to the Consideration of their Hearers; which is, that the
            extreme Severity with which they damn a bad Play seems to terrible a Warning to those
            whose untried Genius might hereafter give them a good one: Whereas it might be a
            Temptation to a latent Author to make the Experiment, could he be sure that, though not
            approved, his Muse might at least be dismiss'd with Decency: But the Vivacity of our
            modern Criticks is of late grown so riotous, that an unsuccessful Author has no more
            Mercy shewn him than a notorious Cheat in a Pillory; every Fool, the lowest Member of
            the Mob, becomes a Wit, and will have a fling at him. They <pb n="177"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0292"/> come now to a new Play like Hounds to a Carcase, and
            are all in a full Cry, sometimes for an Hour together, before the Curtain rises to throw
            it amongst them. Sure those Gentlemen cannot but allow that a Play condemned after a
            fair Hearing falls with thrice the Ignominy as when it is refused that common Justice.</p>
          <p>But when their critical Interruptions grow so loud, and of so long a Continuance, that
            the Attention of quiet People (though not so complete Criticks) is terrify'd, and the
            Skill of the Actors quite disconcerted by the Tumult, the Play then seems rather to fall
            by Assassins than by a Lawful Sentence. <ref target="n177-1" n="207">[177.1]</ref> Is it
            possible that such Auditors can receive Delight, or think it any Praise to them, to
            prosecute so injurious, so unmanly a Treatment? And tho' perhaps the Compassionate, on
            the other side (who know they have as good a Right to clap and support, as others have
            to catcall, damn, and destroy,) may oppose this Oppression; their Good-nature, alas!
            contributes little to the Redress; for in this sort of Civil War the unhappy Author,
            like a good Prince, while his Subjects are at mortal Variance, is sure to be a Loser by
            a Victory on either Side; for still the Commonwealth, his Play, is, during the Conflict,
            torn to pieces. While this is the Case, while the Theatre is so turbulent a Sea and so
            infested with Pirates, what <pb n="178" entity="DSSR_000002909_0293"/> Poetical Merchant
            of any Substance will venture to trade in it? If these valiant Gentlemen pretend to be
            Lovers of Plays, why will they deter Gentlemen from giving them such as are fit for
            Gentlemen to see? In a word, this new Race of Criticks seem to me like the Lion-Whelps
            in the <hi rend="italic">Tower</hi>, who are so boisterously gamesome at their Meals
            that they dash down the Bowls of Milk brought for their own Breakfast. <ref
              target="n178-1" n="208">[178.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>As a good Play is certainly the most rational and the highest Entertainment that Human
            Invention can produce, let that be my Apology (if I need any) for having thus freely
            deliver'd my Mind in behalf of those Gentlemen who, under such calamitous Hazards, may
            hereafter be reduced to write for the Stage, whose Case I shall compassionate from the
            same Motive that prevail'd on <hi rend="italic">Dido</hi> to assist the <hi
              rend="italic">Trojans</hi> in Distress.</p>

              rend="italic">I learn to pity Woes so like my own.</hi></p>
          <p>If those particular Gentlemen have sometimes made me the humbled Object of their Wit
            and Humour, their Triumph at least has done me this involuntary Service, that it has
            driven me a Year or two sooner into a quiet Life than otherwise my own <pb n="179"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0294"/> want of Judgment might have led me to: <ref
              target="n179-1" n="210">[179.1]</ref> I left the Stage before my Strength left me, and
            tho' I came to it again for some few Days a Year or two after, my Reception there not
            only turn'd to my Account, but seem'd a fair Invitation that I would make my Visits more
            frequent: But to give over a Winner can be no very imprudent Resolution. <ref
              target="n179-2" n="211">[179.2]</ref>

            <p> This seems to have been done to a very limited extent. The first unquestionable date
              on which, after 1660, women appeared is 3rd January, 1661, when Pepys saw "The
              Beggar's Bush" at the Theatre, that is, Killigrew's house, and notes, "and here the
              first time that ever I saw women come upon the stage." At the same theatre he had seen
              the same play on 20th November, 1660, the female parts being then played by men.
              Thomas Jordan wrote <hi rend="italic">"A Prologue, to introduce the first woman that
                came to act on the stage, in the tragedy called</hi> The Moor of Venice" (quoted by
              Malone, "Shakespeare," 1821, iii. 128), and Malone supposes justly as I think, that
              this was on 8th December, 1660; on which date, in all probability, the first woman

              Epic&oelig;ne in "The Silent Woman," and on 12th January, 1661, Pepys saw "The
              Scornful Lady," "now done by a woman." On the 4th of the same month Pepys had seen the
              latter play with a man in the chief part, so that it is almost certain that the
              "boy-actresses" disappeared about the beginning of 1661.</p>

              in this. There are many of the Sentiments in this Character, where Nature and common
              Sense are outraged; and an Actor, who shou'd give the full comic Utterance to them in

              to Colley's venom:&mdash;</p>
            <p>'Mr. <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi>, in this part, though he gave full Scope to the

              of him than did the actor (<hi rend="italic">Booth</hi>) in his Representation. When
              angry, his Eye spoke majestic Terror; the noblest and the bravest of his Courtiers
              were awe-struck&mdash;He gave you the full Idea of that arbitrary Prince, who

            <p> William Mountfort was born in 1659 or 1660. He became a member of the Duke's Company
              as a boy, and Downes says that in 1682 he had grown to the maturity of a good actor.
              In the "Counterfeits," licensed 29th August, 1678, the Boy is played by Young <hi
                rend="italic">Mumford,</hi> and in "The Revenge," produced in 1680, the same name
              stands to the part of Jack, the Barber's Boy. After the Union in 1682 he made rapid
              progress, for he played his great character of Sir Courtly Nice as early as 1685. In
              this Cibber gives him the highest praise; and Downes says, "Sir Courtly was so nicely
              Perform'd, that not any succeeding, but Mr. <hi rend="italic">Cyber</hi> has Equall'd
              him." Mountfort was killed by one Captain Hill, aided, it is supposed, by the Lord
              Mohun who died in that terrible duel with the Duke of Hamilton, in 1712, in which they
              hacked each other to death. Whether Hill murdered Mountfort of killed him in fair
              fight is a doubtful point. (See Doran's "Their Majesties' Servants," 1888 edition, i.
              169-172; see also memoir at end of second volume.)</p>

              have been unable to discover any play to which the circumstances mentioned by Cibber
              would apply. But it must not be forgotten that, if the play were damned as completely
              as Cibber says, it would probably not be printed, and we should thus in all
              probability have no record of it.</p>

            <p> Cibber's adaptation, which has held the stage ever since its production, was first
              played at Drury Lane in 1700. Genest (ii. 195-219) gives an exhaustive account of
              Cibber's mutilation. His opinion of it may be gathered from these sentences: "One has
              no wish to disturb Cibber's own Tragedies in their tranquil graves, but while our
              indignation continues to be excited by the frequent representation of Richard the 3d
              in so disgraceful a state, there can be no peace between the friends of

              diverting dances,' Mr. Price 'gained him an universal applause of the town.' The
              versatility of this actor must have been great, or the necessities of the company
              imperious, as we next find him set down for <hi rend="italic">Lord Sands,</hi> in
              'King Henry the Eighth.' He then performed <hi rend="italic">Will</hi>, in the 'Cutter
              of Coleman-street,' and is mentioned by Downs as being dead, in the year 1673."</p>
            <p>The above is Bellchambers's note. He is wrong in stating that Price played the
              Corregidor in Tuke's "Adventures of Five Hours;" his part was Silvio. He omits, too,
              to mention one of Price's best parts, Dufoy, in "Love in a Tub," in which Downes
              specially commends him in this queer couplet:&mdash;</p>
            <lg type="verse">
              <l>"Sir Nich'las, Sir Fred'rick; Widow and Dufoy,</l>
              <l>Were not by any so well done, Mafoy."</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Price does not seem to have acted after May, 1665, when the theatres closed for the
              Plague, for his name is never mentioned by Downes after the theatres re-opened in
              November, 1666, after the Plague and Fire.</p>

              returning of the ball from one player to the other&mdash;what is in lawn tennis
              called a "rally."</p>

            <p> This refers to "Art and Nature," a comedy by James Miller, produced at Drury Lane

              into it and played by Theophilus Cibber. The piece was damned the first night, but it
              must not be forgotten that the Templars damned everything of Miller's on account of
              his supposed insult to them in his farce of "The Coffee House." Bellchambers says the

            <p> This probably refers to the incident related by Davies in his "Dramatic
              Miscellanies":&mdash;"In the play of the 'Recruiting Officer,' Wilks was the
              Captain <hi rend="italic">Plume,</hi> and Pinkethman one of the recruits. The captain,
              when he enlisted him, asked his name: instead of answering as he ought, Pinkey
              replied, 'Why! don't you know my name, Bob? I thought every fool had known that!'
              Wilks, in rage, whispered to him the name of the recruit, <hi rend="italic">Thomas
                Appletree.</hi> The other retorted aloud, '<hi rend="italic">Thomas Appletree?</hi>
              Thomas Devil! my name is Will Pinkethman:' and, immediately addressing an inhabitant
              of the upper regions, he said 'Hark you, friend; don't you know my name?'&mdash;
              'Yes, Master Pinkey,' said a respondent, 'we know it very well.' The play-house was
              now in an uproar: the audience, at first, enjoyed the petulant folly of Pinkethman,
              and the distress of Wilks; but, in the progress of the joke, it grew tiresome, and
              Pinkey met with his deserts, a very severe reprimand in a hiss; and this mark of
              displeasure he changed into applause, by crying out, with a countenance as melancholy
              as he could make it, in a loud and nasal twang, 'Odso! I fear I am wrong'"
            (iii.89).</p>

            <p> Underhill seems to have partially retired about the beginning of 1707. He played Sir
              Joslin Jolley on 5th December, 1706, but Bullock played it on 9th January, 1707, and,
              two days after, Johnson played Underhill's part of the First Gravedigger. Underhill,
              however, played in "The Rover" on 20th January, 1707. The benefit Cibber refers to
              took place on 3rd June, 1709. Underhill played the Gravedigger again on 23rd February,
              1710, and on 12th May, 1710, for his benefit, he played Trincalo in "The Tempest."
              Genest says he acted at Greenwich on 26th August, 1710. The advertisement in the
              "Tatler" (26th May, 1709) runs: "Mr. Cave Underhill, the famous Comedian in the Reigns
              of K. Charles ii. K. James ii. K. William and Q. Mary, and her present Majesty Q.

            <p> John Verbruggen, whose name Downes spells "Vanbruggen," "Vantbrugg," and
              "Verbruggen," is first recorded as having played Termagant in "The Squire of Alsatia,"
              at the Theatre Royal, in 1688. His name last appears in August, 1707, and he must have
              died not long after. On 26th April, 1708, a benefit was announced for "a young orphan
              child of the late Mr. and Mrs. Verbruggen." He seems to have been an actor of great
              natural power, but inartistic in method. See what Anthony Aston says of him. Cibber
              unfairly, as we must think, seems carefully to avoid mentioning him as of any
              importance. "The Laureat," p. 58, says: "I wonder, considering our Author's
              Particularity of Memory, that he hardly ever mentions Mr. <hi rend="italic"
                >Verbruggen,</hi> who was in many Characters an excellent Actor....I cannot conceive

            <p> Bellchambers contradicts Cibber, saying that the Agreement of 14th October, 1681
              [see Memoir of Hart], shows that benefits existed then. The words referred to are,
              "the day the young men or young women play for their own profit only." But this day
              set aside for the young people playing was, I think, quite a different matter from a
              benefit to a particular performer. Pepys (21st March, 1667) says, "The young men and
              women of the house...having liberty to act for their own profit on Wednesdays and
              Fridays this Lent." These were evidently "scratch" performances of "off" nights; and
              it is to these, I think, that the agreement quoted refers.</p>

              created by Queen Anne in the last few days of 1711, and Mrs. Barry did not die till
              the end of 1713.</p>

            <p> Downes includes Mrs. Leigh among the recruits to the Duke's Company about 1670. He
              does not give her maiden name, but Genest supposes she may have been the daughter of
              Dixon, one of Rhodes's Company. As there are two actresses of the name of Mrs. Leigh,
              and one Mrs. Lee, and as no reliance can be placed on the spelling of names in the
              casts of plays, it is practically impossible to decide accurately the parts each
              played. This Mrs. Leigh seems to have been Elizabeth, and her name does not appear
              after 1707, the Eli. Leigh who signed the petition to Queen Anne in 1709 being
              probably a younger woman. Bellchambers has a most inaccurate note regarding Mrs.
              Leigh, stating that she "is probably not a distinct person from Mrs. Mary Lee."</p>

            <p> Mrs. Charlotte Butler is mentioned by Downes as entering the Duke's Company about
              the year 1673. By 1691 she occupied an important position as an actress, and in 1692
              her name appears to the part of La Pupsey in Durfey's "Marriage-Hater Matched." This
              piece must have been produced early in the year, for Ashbury, by whom, as Cibber
              relates, she was engaged for Dublin, opened his season on 23rd March, 1692. Hitchcock,
              in his "View of the Irish Stage," describes her as "an actress of great repute, and a
              prodigious favourite with King Charles the Second" (i. 21).</p>

            <p> Chetwood give a long account of Joseph Ashbury. He was born in 1638, and served for
              some years in the army. By the favour of the Duke of Ormond, then Lord Lieutenant,
              Ashbury was appointed successively Deputy-Master and Master of the Revels in Ireland.
              The latter appointment he seems to have received in 1682, though Hitchcock says
              "1672." Ashbury managed the Dublin Theatre with propriety and success, and was
              considered not only the principal actor in his time there, but the best teacher of
              acting in the three kingdoms. Chetwood, who saw him in his extreme old age, pronounced
              him admirable both in Tragedy and Comedy. He died in 1720, at the great age of
              eighty-two.</p>

            <p> Mrs. Mountfort, originally Mrs. (that is Miss) Percival, and afterwards Mrs.
              Verbruggen, is first mentioned as the representative of Winifrid, a young Welsh jilt,
              in "Sir Barnaby Whigg," a comedy produced at the Theatre Royal in 1681. As Diana, in
              "The Lucky Chance" (1687), Genest gives her name as Mrs. Mountfort, late Mrs.
              Percival; so that her marriage with Mountfort must have taken place about the end of
              1688 or beginning of 1687. Mountfort was killed in 1692, and in 1694 the part of Mary
              the Buxom, in "Don Quixote," part first, is recorded by Genest as played by Mrs.
              Verbruggen, late Mrs. Mountfort. In 1702, in the "Comparison between the Two Stages,"
              Gildon pronounces her "a miracle." In 1703 she died. She was the original
              representative of, among other characters, Nell, in "Devil of a Wife;" Belinda, in
              "The Old Bachelor;" Lady Froth, in "The Double Dealer;" Charlott Welldon, in
              "Oroonoko;" Berinthia, in "Relapse;" Lady Lurewell; Lady Brumpton, in "The Funeral;"

              Her intrigue with Mountfort, who lost his life in consequence of it, is hardly to be
              disputed, and there is pretty ample evidence that Congreve was honoured with a

            <p> Cibber's chronology is a little shaky here. Mrs. Bracegirdle's name appeared for the
              last time in the bill of 20th February, 1707. Betterton's benefit, for which she
              returned to the stage for one night, took place on 7th April, 1709.</p>

            <seg type="note-symbol">[174.2]</seg>
            <p> Mrs. Anne Bracegirdle made her first appearance on the stage as a very young child.
              In the cast of Otway's "Orphan," 1680, the part of Cordelio, Polydore's Page, is said
              to be played by "the little girl," who, Curll ("History," p. 26) informs us, was Anne
              Bracegirdle, then less than six years of age. In 1688 her name appears to the part of
              Lucia in "The Squire of Alsatia;" but it is not till 1691 that she can be said to have
              regularly entered upon her career as an actress. She was the original representative
              of some of the most famous heroines in comedy: Araminta, in "The Old Bachelor;"
              Cynthia, in "The Double Dealer;" Angelica, in "Love for Love;" Belinda, in "The
              Provoked Wife;" Millamant; Flippanta, in "The Confederacy," and many others. Mrs.
              Bracegirdle appears to have been a good and excellent woman, as well as a great
              actress. All the scandal about her seems to have had no further foundation than, to
              quote Genest, "The extreme difficulty with which an actress at this period of the
              stage must have preserved her chastity." Genest goes on to remark, with delicious <hi
                rend="italic">na&iuml;vet&eacute;,</hi> "Mrs. Bracegirdle was perhaps a
              woman of a cold constitution." Her retirement from the stage when not much over thirty
              is accounted for by Curll, by a story of a competition between her and Mrs. Oldfield
              in the part of Mrs. Brittle in "The Amorous Widow," in which the latter was the more
              applauded. He says that they played the part on two successive nights; but I have
              carefully examined Dr. Burney's MSS. in the British Museum for the season 1706-7, and
              "The Amorous Widow" was certainly not played twice successively. I doubt the story
              altogether. That Mrs. Bracegirdle retired because Mrs. Oldfield was excelling her in
              popular estimation is most likely, but I can find no confirmation whatever for Curll's
              story. "The Laureat," p. 36, attributes her retirement to Mrs. Oldfield's being
              "preferr'd to some Parts before her, by our very <hi rend="italic">Apologist</hi>';
              but though the reason thus given is probably accurate, the person blamed is as
              probably guiltless; for I do not think Cibber could have sufficient authority to
              distribute parts in 1706-7. Mrs. Bracegirdle died September, 1748, but was dead to the
              stage from 1709. Cibber's remark on p. 99 had therefore no reference to her.</p>

            <p> Cibber writes here with feeling; for, after his "Nonjuror" abused the Jacobites and
              Nonjurors, that party took every opportunity of revenging themselves on him by
              maltreating his plays.</p>

            <p> This is a curious statement, and has never, so far as I know, been commented on; the
              cause of Cibber's retirement having always been considered mysterious. I suppose this
              reference to ill-treatment must be held as confirming Davies's statement that the
              public lost patience at Cibber's continually playing tragic parts, and fairly hissed
              him off the stage. Davies ("Dram. Misc.," iii. 471) relates the following incident:
              "When Thomson's Sophonisba was read to the actors, Cibber laid his hand upon Scipio, a
              character, which, though it appears only in the last act, is of great dignity and
              importance. For two nights successively, Cibber was as much exploded as any bad actor
              could be. Williams, by desire of Wilks, made himself master of the part; but he,
              marching slowly, in great military distinction, from the upper part of the stage, and
              wearing the same dress as Cibber, was mistaken for him, and met with repeated hisses,
              joined to the music of catcals; but, as soon as the audience were undeceived, they
              converted their groans and hisses to loud and long continued applause."</p>

            <seg type="note-symbol">[179.2]</seg>
            <p> Cibber retired in May, 1733. The reappearance he refers to was not that he made in
              1738, as Bellchambers states. He no doubt alludes to his performances in 1734-35, when
              he played Bayes, Lord Foppington, Sir John Brute, and other comedy parts. On the
              nights he played, the compliment was paid him of putting no name in the bill but his
              own.</p>

            necessary to let you know me in my Obscurity, as well as in my higher Light, when I
            became one of the Theatrical Triumvirat.</p>

          <p>The Patentees, <ref target="n181-1" n="212">[181.1]</ref> who were now Masters of this
            united and only Company of Comedians, seem'd to make it a Rule that no young Persons
            desirous to be Actors should be admitted into Pay under at least half a Year's
            Probation, wisely knowing that how early soever they might be approv'd of, there could
            be no great fear of losing them while they had then no other Market to go to. But, alas!
            Pay was the least of my Concern; the Joy and Privilege of every Day seeing Plays for
            nothing I thought was a sufficient Consideration for the best of my Services. So that it
            was no Pain to my Patience that I waited full three Quarters of a Year before I was
            taken into a Salary of Ten Shillings <hi rend="italic">per</hi> Week; <ref
              target="n181-2" n="213">[181.2]</ref> which, with the Assistance of Food and Raiment
            at my Father's <pb n="182" entity="DSSR_000002909_0297"/> House, I then thought a most
            plentiful Accession, and myself the happiest of Mortals.</p>
          <p>The first Thing that enters into the Head of a young Actor is that of being a Heroe: In
            this Ambition I was soon snubb'd by the Insufficiency of my Voice; to which might be
            added an uninform'd meagre Person, (tho' then not ill made) with a dismal pale
            Complexion. <ref target="n182-1" n="214">[182.1]</ref> Under these Disadvantages,<ref
              target="n182-2" n="215">[182.2]</ref> I had but a melancholy Prospect of ever playing
            a Lover with Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Bracegirdle,</hi> which I had flatter'd my Hopes
            that my Youth might one Day have recommended me to. What was most promising in me, then,
            was the Aptness of my Ear; for I was soon allow'd to speak <pb n="183"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0298"/> justly, tho' what was grave and serious did not equally
            become me. The first Part, therefore, in which I appear'd with any glimpse of Success,
            was the Chaplain <ref target="n183-1" n="216">[183.1]</ref> in the <hi rend="italic"
              >Orphan</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Otway.</hi> There is in this Character (of one Scene
            only) a decent Pleasantry, and Sense enough to shew an Audience whether the Actor has
            any himself. Here was the first Applause I ever receiv'd, which, you may be sure, made
            my Heart leap with a higher Joy than may be necessary to describe; and yet my Transport
            was not then half so high as at what <hi rend="italic">Goodman</hi> (who had now left
            the Stage) said of me the next Day in my hearing. <hi rend="italic">Goodman</hi> often
            came to a Rehearsal for Amusement, and having sate out the <hi rend="italic">Orphan</hi>
            the Day before, in a Conversation with some of the principal Actors enquir'd what new
            young Fellow that was whom he had seen in the Chaplain? Upon which <hi rend="italic"
              >Monfort</hi> reply'd, <hi rend="italic">That's he, behind you. Goodman</hi> then
            turning about, look'd earnestly at me, and, after some Pause, clapping me on the
            Shoulder, rejoin'd, <hi rend="italic">If he does not make a good Actor, I'll be
              d&mdash;'d!</hi> The Surprize of being commended by one who had been himself so
            eminent on the Stage, and in so positive a manner, was more than I could support; in a
            Word, it almost took away my Breath, and (laugh, if you please) fairly drew Tears from
            my Eyes! And, tho' it may be as ridiculous as incredible to tell you what a full Vanity
            and <pb n="184" entity="DSSR_000002909_0299"/> Content at that time possess'd me, I will

            what low Particulars I am forc'd to descend to give you a true Resemblance of the early
            and lively Follies of my Mind. Let me give you another Instance of my Discretion, more
            desperate than that of preferring the Stage to any other Views of Life. One might think

            when I had but Twenty Pounds a Year, which my Father had assur'd to me, and Twenty
            Shillings a Week from my Theatrical Labours, to maintain, as I then thought, the
            happiest young Couple that ever took a Leap in the Dark! If after this, to complete my
            Fortune, I <pb n="185" entity="DSSR_000002909_0300"/> turn'd Poet too, this last Folly
            indeed had something a better Excuse&mdash;Necessity: Had it never been my Lot to
            have come on the Stage, 'tis probable I might never have been inclin'd or reduc'd to
            have wrote for it: But having once expos'd my Person there, I thought it could be no
            additional Dishonour to let my Parts, whatever they were, take their Fortune along with
            it.&mdash;But to return to the Progress I made as an Actor.</p>
          <p>Queen <hi rend="italic">Mary</hi> having commanded the <hi rend="italic">Double
            Dealer</hi> to be acted, <hi rend="italic">Kynaston</hi> happen'd to be so ill that he
            could not hope to be able next Day to perform his Part of the Lord <hi rend="italic"
              >Touchwood.</hi> In this Exigence, the Author, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Congreve</hi>,
            advis'd that it might be given to me, if at so short a Warning I would undertake it.
              <ref target="n185-1" n="218">[185.1]</ref> The Flattery of being thus distinguish'd by
            so celebrated an Author, and the Honour to act before a Queen, you may be sure made me
            blind to whatever Difficulties might attend it. I accepted the Part, and was ready in it
            before I slept; next Day the Queen was present at the Play, and was receiv'd with a new
            Prologue from the Author, spoken by Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Barry</hi>, humbly
            acknowledging the great Honour done to the Stage, and to his Play in particular: Two
            Lines of it, which tho' I have not since read, I still remember.</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l><hi rend="italic">But never were in</hi> Rome <hi rend="italic">nor</hi> Athens <hi
                rend="italic">seen,</hi></l>

          <pb n="186" entity="DSSR_000002909_0301"/>
          <p>After the Play, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Congreve</hi> made me the Compliment of saying,
            That I had not only answer'd, but had exceeded his Expectations, and that he would shew
            me he was sincere by his saying more of me to the Masters.&mdash;He was as good as
            his Word, and the next Pay-day I found my Sallary of fifteen was then advanc'd to twenty
            Shillings a Week. But alas! this favourable Opinion of Mr. <hi rend="italic"
            >Congreve</hi> made no farther Impression upon the Judgment of my good Masters; it only
            serv'd to heighten my own Vanity, but could not recommend me to any new Trials of my
            Capacity; not a Step farther could I get 'till the Company was again divided, when the
            Desertion of the best Actors left a clear Stage for younger Champions to mount and shew
            their best Pretensions to Favour. But it is now time to enter upon those Facts that
            immediately preceded this remarkable Revolution of the Theatre.</p>
          <p>You have seen how complete a Set of Actors were under the Government of the united
            Patents in 1690; if their Gains were not extraordinary, what shall we impute it to but
            some extraordinary ill Menagement? I was then too young to be in their Secrets, and
            therefore can only observe upon what I saw and have since thought visibly wrong.</p>
          <pb n="187" entity="DSSR_000002909_0302"/>
          <p>Though the Success of the <hi rend="italic">Prophetess</hi>
            <ref target="n187-1" n="219">[187.1]</ref> and <hi rend="italic">King Arthur</hi>
            <ref target="n187-2" n="220">[187.2]</ref> (two dramatic Operas, in which the Patentees
            had embark'd all their Hopes) was in Appearance very great, yet their whole Receipts did
            not so far balance their Expence as to keep them out of a large Debt, which it was
            publickly known was about this time contracted, and which found Work for the Court of
            Chancery for about twenty Years following, till one side of the Cause grew weary. But
            this was not all that was wrong; every Branch of the Theatrical Trade had been
            sacrific'd to the necessary fitting out those tall Ships of Burthen that were to bring
            home the <hi rend="italic">Indies.</hi> Plays of course were neglected, Actors held
            cheap, and slightly dress'd, while Singers and Dancers were better paid, and
            embroider'd. These Measures, of course, created Murmurings on one side, and Ill-humour
            and Contempt on the other. When it became necessary therefore to lessen the Charge, a
            Resolution was <pb n="188" entity="DSSR_000002909_0303"/> taken to begin with the
            Sallaries of the Actors; and what seem'd to make this Resolution more necessary at this
            time was the Loss of <hi rend="italic">Nokes, Monfort,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
            >Leigh,</hi> who all dy'd about the same Year: <ref target="n188-1" n="221"
            >[188.1]</ref> No wonder then, if when these great Pillars were at once remov'd, the
            Building grew weaker and the Audiences very much abated. Now in this Distress, what more
            natural Remedy could be found than to incite and encourage (tho' with some Hazard) the
            Industry of the surviving Actors? But the Patentees, it seems, thought the surer way as
            to bring down their Pay in proportion to the Fall of their Audiences. To make this
            Project more feasible they propos'd to begin at the Head of 'em, rightly judging that if
            the Principals acquiesc'd, their Inferiors would murmur in vain. To bring this about
            with a better Grace, they, under Pretence of bringing younger Actors forward, order'd
            several of <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi>'s and Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Barry</hi>'s
            chief Parts to be given to young <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi> and Mrs. <hi rend="italic"
              >Bracegirdle.</hi> In this they committed two palpable Errors; for while the best
            Actors are in Health, and still on the Stage, the Publick is always apt to be out of
            Humour when those of a lower Class pretend to stand in their Places; or admitting at
            this time they might have been accepted, this Project might very probably have lessen'd,
            but could not possibly mend an Audience, and was a sure Loss of that Time, in studying,
            which might have <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0304"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0305"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0306"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0307"/>
            <pb n="189" entity="DSSR_000002909_0308"/> been better employ'd in giving the Auditor
            Variety, the only Temptation to a pall'd Appetite; and Variety is only to be given by
            Industry: But Industry will always be lame when the Actor has Reason to be discontented.
            This the Patentees did not consider, or pretended not to value, while they thought their
            Power secure and uncontroulable: But farther their first Project did not succeed; for
            tho' the giddy Head of <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi> accepted the Parts of <hi
              rend="italic">Betterton</hi>, Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Bracegirdle</hi> had a different
            way of thinking, and desir'd to be excus'd from those of Mrs. <hi rend="italic"
            >Barry;</hi> her good Sense was not to be misled by the insidious Favour of the
            Patentees; she knew the Stage was wide enough for her Success, without entring into any
            such rash and invidious Competition with Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Barry,</hi> and
            therefore wholly refus'd acting any Part that properly belong'd to her. But this
            Proceeding, however, was Warning enough to make <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi> be upon
            his Guard, and to alarm others with Apprehensions of their own Safety, from the Design
            that was laid against him: <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi> upon this drew into his
            Party most of the valuable Actors, who, to secure their Unity, enter'd with him into a
            sort of Association to stand or fall together. <ref target="n189-1" n="222"
            >[189.1]</ref> All this the Patentees for some time slighted; but when Matters drew
            towards a Crisis, they found it <pb n="190" entity="DSSR_000002909_0309"/> adviseable to
            take the same Measures, and accordingly open'd an Association on their part; both which
            were severally sign'd, as the Interest of Inclination of either Side led them.</p>
          <p>During these Contentions which the impolitick Patentees had rais'd against themselves
            (not only by this I have mentioned, but by many other Grievances which my Memory retains
            not) the Actors offer'd a Treaty of Peace; but their Masters imagining no Consequence
            could shake the Right of their Authority, refus'd all Terms of Accommodation. In the
            mean time this Dissention was so prejudicial to their daily Affairs, that I remember it
            was allow'd by both Parties that before <hi rend="italic">Christmas</hi> the Patent had
            lost the getting of at least a thousand Pounds by it.</p>
          <p>My having been a Witness of this unnecessary Rupture was of great use to me when, many
            Years after, I came to be a Menager my self. I laid it down as a settled Maxim, that no
            Company could flourish while the chief Actors and the Undertakers were at variance. I
            therefore made it a Point, while it was possible upon tolerable Terms, to keep the
            valuable Actors in humour with their Station; and tho' I was as jealous of their
            Encroachments as any of my Co-partners could be, I always guarded against the least
            Warmth in my Expostulations with them; not but at the same time they might see I was
            perhaps more determin'd in the Question than those that gave a loose to their
            Resentment, and <pb n="191" entity="DSSR_000002909_0310"/> when they were cool were as
            apt to recede. <ref target="n191-1" n="223">[191.1]</ref> I do not remember that ever I
            made a Promise to any that I did not keep, and therefore was cautious how I made them.
            This Coldness, tho' it might not please, at least left them nothing to reproach me with;
            and if Temper and fair Words could prevent a Disobligation, I was sure never to give
            Offence or receive it. <ref target="n191-2" n="224">[191.2]</ref> But as I was but one
            of three, I could not oblige others to observe the same Conduct. However, by this means
            I kept many an unreasonable Discontent from breaking out, and both Sides found their
            Account in it.</p>
          <p>How a contemptuous and overbearing manner of treating Actors had like to have ruin'd us
            in our early Prosperity shall be shewn in its Place. <ref target="n191-3" n="225"
              >[191.3]</ref> If future Menagers should chance to think my way right, I suppose they
            will follow it; if not, when they find what happen'd to the Patentees (who chose to
            disagree with their People) perhaps they may think better of it.</p>
          <p>The Patentees then, who by their united Powers <pb n="192" entity="DSSR_000002909_0311"
            /> had made a Monopoly of the Stage, and consequently presum'd they might impose what
            Conditions they pleased upon their People, did not consider that they were all this
            while endeavouring to enslave a Set of Actors whom the Publick (more arbitrary than
            themselves) were inclined to support; nor did they reflect that the Spectator naturally
            wish'd that the Actor who gave him Delight might enjoy the Profits arising from his
            Labour, without regard of what pretended Damage or Injustice might fall upon his Owners,
            whose personal Merit the Publick was not so well acquainted with,. From this
            Consideration, then, several Persons of the highest Distinction espous'd their Cause,
            and sometimes in the Circle entertain'd the King with the State of the Theatre. At
            length their Grievances were laid before the Earl of <hi rend="italic">Dorset</hi>, then
            Lord Chamberlain, who took the most effectual Method for their Relief. <ref
              target="n192-1" n="226">[192.1]</ref> The Learned of the Law were <pb n="193"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0312"/> advised with, and they gave their Opinion that no
            Patent for acting Plays, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> could tie up the Hands of a
            succeeding Prince from granting the like Authority where it might be thought proper to
            trust it. But while this Affair was in Agitation, Queen <hi rend="italic">Mary</hi>
            dy'd, <ref target="n193-1" n="227">[193.1]</ref> which of course occasion'd a Cessation
            of all publick Diversions. In this melancholy Interim, <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi>
            and his Adherents had more Leisure to sollicit their Redress; and the Patentees now
            finding that the Party against them was gathering Strength, were reduced to make sure of
            as good a Company as the Leavings of <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi>'s Interest could
            form; and these, you may be sure, would not lose this Occasion of setting a Price upon
            their Merit equal to their own Opinion of it, which was but just double to what they had
            before. <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Verbruggen,</hi> who had then
            but forty Shillings a Week, were now raised each of them to four Pounds, and others in
            Proportion: As for myself, I was then too insignificant to be taken into their Councils,
            and consequently stood among those of little Importance, like Cattle in a Market, to be
            sold to the first Bidder. But the Patentees seeming in the greater Distress for Actors,
            condescended to purchase me. Thus, <pb n="194" entity="DSSR_000002909_0313"/> without
            any farther Merit than that of being a scarce Commodity, I was advanc'd to thirty
            Shillings a Week: Yet our Company was so far from being full, <ref target="n194-1"
              n="228">[194.1]</ref> that our Commanders were forced to beat up for Volunteers in
            several distant Counties; it was this Occasion that first brought <hi rend="italic"
              >Johnson</hi>
            <ref target="n194-2" n="229">[194.2]</ref> and <hi rend="italic">Bullock</hi>
            <ref target="n194-3" n="230">[194.3]</ref> to the Service of the Theatre-Royal.</p>
          <p>Forces being thus raised, and the War declared on both Sides, <hi rend="italic"
              >Betterton</hi> and his Chiefs had the Honour of an Audience of the <hi rend="italic"
              >King</hi>, who consider'd them as the only Subjects whom he had not yet deliver'd
            from arbitrary Power, and graciously dismiss'd them with an Assurance of Relief and
            Support &mdash;Accordingly a select number of them were impower'd by his Royal
            Licence <ref target="n194-4" n="231">[194.4]</ref> to act in a separate Theatre for
            themselves. This great Point being obtain'd, many People of Quality came into a
            voluntary Subscription of twenty, and some of forty Guineas a-piece, for erecting a
            Theatre within the Walls of the Tennis-Court in <hi rend="italic">Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.</hi>
            <ref target="n194-5" n="232">[194.5]</ref> But as <pb n="195"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0314"/> it required Time to fit it up, it gave the Patentees
            more Leisure to muster their Forces, who notwithstanding were not able to take the Field
            till the <hi rend="italic">Easter-Monday</hi> in <hi rend="italic">April</hi> following.
            Their first Attempt was a reviv'd Play call'd <hi rend="italic">Abdelazar</hi>, or the
              <hi rend="italic">Moor's Revenge,</hi> poorly written, by Mrs. <hi rend="italic"
            >Behn.</hi> The House was very full, but whether it was the Play or the Actors that were
            not approved, the next Day's Audience sunk to nothing. However, we were assured that let
            the Audiences be never so low, our Masters would make good all Deficiencies, and so
            indeed they did, 'till towards the End of the Season, when Dues to Ballance came too
            thick upon 'em. But that I may go gradually on with my own Fortune, I must take this
            Occasion to let you know, by the following Circumstance, how very low my Capacity as an
            Actor was then rated: It was thought necessary at our Opening that the Town should be
            address'd in a new Prologue; but to our great Distress, among several that were offer'd,
            not one was judg'd fit to be spoken. This I thought a favourable Occasion to do my self
            some remarkable Service, if I should have the good Fortune to produce one that might be
            accepted. The next (memorable) Day my Muse brought forth her first Fruit that was ever
            made publick; how good or bad imports not; my Prologue was accepted, and resolv'd on to
            be spoken. This Point being gain'd, I began to stand upon <pb n="196"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0315"/> Terms, you will say, not unreasonable; which were, that
            if I might speak it my self I would expect no farther Reward for my Labour: This was
            judg'd as bad as having no Prologue at all! You may imagine how hard I thought it, that
            they durst not trust my poor poetical Brat to my own Care. But since I found it was to
            be given into other Hands, I insisted that two Guineas should be the Price of my parting
            with it; which with a Sigh I received, and <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi> spoke the
            Prologue: But every Line that was applauded went sorely to my Heart when I reflected
            that the same Praise might have been given to my own speaking; nor could the Success of
            the Author compensate the Distress of the Actor. However, in the End, it serv'd in some
            sort to mend our People's Opinion of me; and whatever the Criticks might think of it,
            one of the Patentees <ref target="n196-1" n="233">[196.1]</ref> (who, it is true, knew
            no Difference between <hi rend="italic">Dryden</hi> and <hi rend="italic">D'urfey</hi>)
            said, upon the Success of it, that insooth! I was an ingenious young Man. This sober
            Compliment (tho' I could have no Reason to be vain upon it) I thought was a fair Promise
            to my being in favour. But to Matters of more Moment: Now let us reconnoitre the Enemy.</p>
          <p>After we had stolen some few Days March upon them, the Forces of <hi rend="italic"
              >Betterton</hi> came up with us in terrible Order: In about three Weeks following, the
            new Theatre was open'd against us with a veteran Company and a new Train of Artillery;
            or in plainer <pb n="197" entity="DSSR_000002909_0316"/>
            <hi rend="italic">English</hi>, the old Actors in <hi rend="italic"
            >Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</hi> began with a new Comedy of Mr. <hi rend="italic"
            >Congreve</hi>'s, call'd <hi rend="italic">Love</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Love;</hi>
            <ref target="n197-1" n="234">[197.1]</ref> which ran on with such extraordinary Success
            that they had seldom occasion to act any other Play 'till the End of the Season. This
            valuable Play had a narrow Escape from falling into the Hands of the Patentees; for
            before the Division of the Company it had been read and accepted of at the
            Theatre-Royal: But while the Articles of Agreement for it were preparing, the Rupture in
            the Theatrical State was so far advanced that the Author took time to pause before he
            sign'd them; when finding that all Hopes of Accommodation were impracticable, he thought
            it advisable to let it take its Fortune with those Actors for whom he had first intended
            the Parts.</p>
          <p>Mr. <hi rend="italic">Congreve</hi> was then in such high Reputation as an Author, that
            besides his Profits from this Play, they offered him a whole Share with them, which he
            accepted; <ref target="n197-2" n="235">[197.2]</ref> in Consideration of which he
            oblig'd himself, if his Health permitted, to give them one new Play every Year. <ref

              entity="DSSR_000002909_0317"/> Time, had the same Share with the King's Company, but
            he bound himself to give them two Plays every Season. This you may imagine he could not
            hold long, and I am apt to think he might have <pb n="199" entity="DSSR_000002909_0318"
            /> serv'd them better with one in a Year, not so hastily written. Mr. <hi rend="italic"
              >Congreve,</hi> whatever Impediment he met with, was three Years before, in pursuance
            to his Agreement, he produced the <hi rend="italic">Mourning Bride;</hi>
            <ref target="n199-1" n="237">[199.1]</ref>
            <pb n="200" entity="DSSR_000002909_0319"/> and if I mistake not, the Interval had been
            much the same when he gave them the <hi rend="italic">Way of the World.</hi>
            <ref target="n200-1" n="238">[200.1]</ref> But it came out the stronger for the Time it
            cost him, and to their better support when they sorely wanted it: For though they went
            on with Success for a Year or two, and even when their Affairs were declining stood in
            much higher Estimation of the Publick than their Opponents; yet in the End both Sides
            were great Sufferers by their Separation; the natural Consequence of two Houses, which I
            have already mention'd in a former Chapter.</p>
          <p>The first Error this new Colony of Actors fell into was their inconsiderately parting
            with <hi rend="italic">Williams</hi> and Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Monfort</hi>
            <ref target="n200-2" n="239">[200.2]</ref> upon a too nice (not to say severe)
            Punctilio; in not allowing them to be equal Sharers with the rest; which before they had
            acted one Play occasioned their Return to the Service of the Patentees. As I have call'd
            this an Error, I ought to give my Reasons for it. Though the Industry of <hi
              rend="italic">Williams</hi> was not equal to his Capacity; for he lov'd his Bottle
            better than his Business; and though Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Monfort</hi> was only
            excellent in Comedy, yet their Merit was too great almost on any Scruples to be added to
            the Enemy; and at worst, they were certainly much more above those they would have
            ranked them with than they could possibly be under <pb n="201"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0320"/> those they were not admitted to be equal to. Of this
            Fact there is a poetical Record in the Prologue to <hi rend="italic">Love for Love,</hi>
            where the Author, speaking of the then happy State of the Stage, observes that if, in
            Paradise, when two only were there, they both fell; the Surpize was less, if from so
            numerous a Body as theirs, there had been any Deserters.</p>

          <p>These Lines alluded to the Revolt of the Persons above mention'd.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the Acquisition of these two Actors, who were of more Importance than
            any of those to whose Assistance they came, the Affairs of the Patentees were still in a
            very creeping Condition; <ref target="n201-2" n="241">[201.2]</ref> they were now, too
            late, convinced of their Error in having provok'd their People to this Civil <pb n="202"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0321"/> War of the Theatre! quite changed and dismal now was
            the Prospect before them! their Houses thin, and the Town crowding into a new one!
            Actors at double Sallaries, and not half the usual Audiences to pay them! And all this
            brought upon them by those whom their full Security had contemn'd, and who were now in a
            fair way of making their Fortunes upon the ruined Interest of their Oppressors.</p>
          <p>Here, tho' at this time my Fortune depended on the Success of the Patentees, I cannot
            help in regard to Truth remembring the rude and riotous Havock we made of all the late
            dramatic Honours of the Theatre! all became at once the Spoil of Ignorance and
            Self-conceit! <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> was defac'd and tortured in every signal
              Character&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>
            lost in one Hour all their good Sense, their Dignity and Fame. <hi rend="italic"
            >Brutus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cassius</hi> became noisy Blusterers, with bold
            unmeaning Eyes, mistaken Sentiments, and turgid Elocution! Nothing, sure, could more
            painfully regret <ref target="n202-1" n="242">[202.1]</ref> a judicious Spectator than
            to see, at our first setting out, with what rude Confidence those Habits which actors of
            real Merit had left behind them were worn by giddy Pretenders that so vulgarly disgraced
            them! Not young Lawyers in hir'd Robes and Plumes at a Masquerade could be <pb n="203"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0322"/> less what they would seem, or more aukwardly personate
            the Characters they belong'd to. If, in all these Acts of wanton Waste, these Insults
            upon injur'd Nature, you observe I have not yet charged one of them upon myself, it is
            not from an imaginary Vanity that I could have avoided them; but that I was rather safe,
            by being too low at that time to be admitted even to my Chance of falling into the same
            eminent Errors: So that as none of those great Parts ever fell to my Share, I could not
            be accountable for the Execution of them: Nor indeed could I get one good Part of any
            kind 'till many Months after; unless it were of that sort which no body else car'd for,
            or would venture to expose themselves in. <ref target="n203-1" n="243">[203.1]</ref> The
            first unintended Favour, therefore, of a Part of any Value, Necessity threw upon me on
            the following Occasion.</p>
          <p>As it has been always judg'd their natural Interest, where there are two Theatres, to
            do one another as <pb n="204" entity="DSSR_000002909_0323"/> much Mischief as they can,
            you may imagine it could not be long before this hostile Policy shew'd itself in Action.
            It happen'd, upon our having Information on a <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> Morning
            that the <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi> after <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> was intended
            to be acted at the other House, where it had not yet been seen, our merry menaging
            Actors, (for they were now in a manner left to govern themselves) resolv'd at any rate
            to steal a March upon the Enemy, and take Possession of the same Play the Day before
            them: Accordingly, <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> was given out that Night to be Acted
            with us on <hi rend="italic">Monday.</hi> The Notice of this sudden Enterprize soon
            reach'd the other House, who in my Opinion too much regarded it; for they shorten'd
            their first Orders, and resolv'd that <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> should to <hi
              rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> be opposed on the same Day; whereas, had they given notice
            in their Bills that the same Play would have been acted by them the Day after, the Town
            would have been in no Doubt which House they should have reserved themselves for; ours
            must certainly have been empty, and theirs, with more Honour, have been crowded:
            Experience, many Years after, in like Cases, has convinced me that this would have been
            the more laudable Conduct. But be that as it may; when in their <hi rend="italic"
            >Monday</hi>'s Bills it was seen that <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> was up against us,
            our Consternation was terrible, to find that so hopeful a Project was frustrated. In
            this Distress, <hi rend="italic">Powel,</hi> who was our commanding Officer, and whose
            enterprising Head wanted nothing but Skill to carry him through <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0324"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0325"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0326"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0327"/>
            <pb n="205" entity="DSSR_000002909_0328"/> the most desperate Attempts; for, like others
            of his Cast, he had murder'd many a Hero only to get into his Cloaths. This <hi
              rend="italic">Powel</hi>, I say, immediately called a Council of War, where the
            Question was, Whether he should fairly face the Enemy, or make a Retreat to some other
            Play of more probable Safety? It was soon resolved that to act <hi rend="italic"
            >Hamlet</hi> against <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> would be certainly throwing away the
            Play, and disgracing themselves to little or no Audience; to conclude, <hi rend="italic"
              >Powel,</hi> who was vain enough to envy <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi> as his
            Rival, proposed to change Plays with them, and that as they had given out the <hi
              rend="italic">Old Batchelor,</hi> and had chang'd it for <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>
            against us, we should give up our <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> and turn the <hi
              rend="italic">Old Batchelor</hi> upon them. This Motion was agreed to, <hi
              rend="italic">Nemine contradicente;</hi> but upon Enquiry, it was found that there
            were not two Persons among them who had ever acted in that Play: But that Objection, it
            seems, (though all the Parts were to be study'd in six Hours) was soon got over; <hi
              rend="italic">Powel</hi> had an Equivalent, <hi rend="italic">in petto.</hi> that
            would ballance any Deficiency on that Score, which was, that he would play the <hi
              rend="italic">Old Batchelor</hi> himself, and mimick <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi>
            throughout the whole Part. This happy Thought was approv'd with Delight and Applause, as
            whatever can be suppos'd to ridicule Merit generally gives joy to those that want it:
            Accordingly the Bills were chang'd, and at the Bottom inserted, <hi rend="italic">The
              Part of the</hi> Old Batchelor <hi rend="italic">to be perform'd in Imitation of the
              Original.</hi>
            <pb n="206" entity="DSSR_000002909_0329"/> Printed Books of the Play were sent for in
            haste, and every Actor had one to pick out of it the Part he had chosen: Thus, while
            they were each of them chewing the Morsel they had most mind to, some one happening to
            cast his Eye over the <hi rend="italic">Dramatis Person&aelig;,</hi> found that the
            main Matter was still forgot, that no body had yet been thought of for the Part of
            Alderman <hi rend="italic">Fondlewife.</hi> Here we were all aground agen! nor was it to
            be conceiv'd who could make the least tolerable Shift with it. This Character had been
            so admirably acted by <hi rend="italic">Dogget,</hi> that though it is only seen in the
            Fourth Act, it may be no Dispraise to the Play to say it probably ow'd the greatest Part
            of its Success to his Performance. But, as the Case was now desperate, any Resource was
            better than none. Somebody must swallow the bitter Pill, or the Play must die. At last
            it was recollected that I had been heard to say in my wild way of talking, what a vast
            mind I had to play <hi rend="italic">Nykin,</hi> by which Name the Character was more
            frequently call'd. <ref target="n206-1" n="244">[206.1]</ref> Notwithstanding they were
            thus distress'd about the Disposal of this Part, most of them shook their Heads at my
            being mention'd for it; yet <hi rend="italic">Powel,</hi> who was resolv'd at all
            Hazards to fall upon <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi>, and <pb n="207"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0330"/> having no concern for what might become of any one that
            serv'd his Ends or Purpose, order'd me to be sent for; and, as he naturally lov'd to set
            other People wrong, honestly said before I came, <hi rend="italic">If the Fool has a
              mind to blow himself up at once, let us ev'n give him a clear Stage for it.</hi>
            Accordingly the Part was put into my Hands between Eleven and Twelve that Morning, which
            I durst not refuse, because others were as much straitned in time for Study as myself.
            But I had this casual Advantage of most of them; that having so constantly observ'd <hi
              rend="italic">Dogget</hi>'s Performance, I wanted but little Trouble to make me
            perfect in the Words; so that when it came to my turn to rehearse, while others read
            their Parts from their Books, I had put mine in my Pocket, and went thro' the first
            Scene without it; and though I was more abash'd to rehearse so remarkable a Part before
            the Actors (which is natural to most young People) than to act before an Audience, yet
            some of the better-natur'd encouraged me so far as to say they did not think I should
            make an ill Figure in it: To conclude, the Curiosity to see <hi rend="italic"
            >Betterton</hi> mimick'd drew us a pretty good Audience, and <hi rend="italic"
            >Powel</hi> (as far as Applause is a Proof of it) was allow'd to have burlesqu'd him
            very well. <ref target="n207-1" n="245">[207.1]</ref> As I have question'd <pb n="208"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0331"/> the certain Value of Applause, I hope I may venture
            with less Vanity to say how particular a Share I had of it in the same Play. At my first
            Appearance one might have imagin'd by the various Murmurs of the Audience, that they
            were in doubt whether <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> himself were not return'd, or that
            they could not conceive what strange Face it could be that so nearly resembled him; for
            I had laid the Tint of forty Years more than my real Age upon my Features, and, to the
            most minute placing of an Hair, was dressed exactly like him: When I spoke, the Surprize
            was still greater, as if I had not only borrow'd his Cloaths, but his Voice too. But
            tho' that was the least difficult Part of him to be imitated, they seem'd to allow I had
            so much of him in every other Requisite, that my Applause was, perhaps, more than
            proportionable: For, whether I had done so much where so little was expected, or that
            the Generosity of my Hearers were more than usually zealous upon so unexpected an
            Occasion, or from what other Motive such Favour might be pour'd upon me, I cannot say;
            but in plain and honest Truth, upon my gong off from the first Scene, a much better
            Actor might have been proud of the Applause that followed me; after one loud <hi
              rend="italic">Plaudit</hi> was ended and sunk into a general Whisper that seem'd still
            to continue their private Approbation, it reviv'd to a second, and again to a third,
            still louder than the <pb n="209" entity="DSSR_000002909_0332"/> former. If to all this
            I add, that <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> himself was in the Pit at the same time, it
            would be too rank Affectation if I should not confess that to see him there a Witness of
            my Reception, was to me as consummate a Triumph as the Heart of Vanity could be indulg'd
            with. But whatever Vanity I might set upon my self from this unexpected Success, I found
            that was no Rule to other People's Judgment of me. There were few or no Parts of the
            same kind to be had; nor could they conceive, from what I had done in this, what other
            sort of Characters I could be fit for. If I sollicited for any thing of a different
            Nature, I was answered, <hi rend="italic">That was not in my Way.</hi> And what <hi
              rend="italic">was</hi> in my way it seems was not as yet resolv'd upon. And though I
            reply'd, <hi rend="italic">That I thought any thing naturally written ought to be in
              every one's Way that pretended to be an Actor;</hi> this was looked upon as a vain,
            impracticable Conceit of my own. Yet it is a Conceit that, in forty Years farther
            Experience, I have not yet given up; I still think that a Painter who can draw but one
            sort of Object, or an Actor that shines but in one Light, can neither of them boast of
            that ample Genius which is necessary to form a thorough Master of his Art: For tho'
            Genius may have a particular Inclination, yet a good History-Painter, or a good Actor,
            will, without being at a loss, give you upon Demand a proper Likeness of whatever nature
            produces. If he cannot do this, he is only an Actor as the Shoemaker was allow'd a
            limited Judge of <hi rend="italic">Apelle</hi>'s Painting, <pb n="210"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0333"/> but <hi rend="italic">not beyond his Last.</hi> Now,
            tho' to do any one thing well may have more Merit than we often meet with, and may be
            enough to procure a Man the Name of a good Actor from the Publick; yet, in my Opinion,
            it is but still the Name without the Substance. If his Talent is in such narrow Bounds
            that he dares not step out of them to look upon the Singularities of Mankind, and cannot
            catch them in whatever Form they present themselves; if he is not Master of the <hi
              rend="italic">Quicquid agunt homines,</hi>
            <ref target="n210-1" n="246">[210.1]</ref> &amp;c. in any Shape Human Nature is fit
            to be seen in; if he cannot change himself into several distinct Persons, so as to vary
            his whole Tone of Voice, his Motion, his Look and Gesture, whether in high or lower
            Life, and, at the same time, keep close to those Variations without leaving the
            Character they singly belong to; if his best Skill falls short of this Capacity, what
            Pretence have we to call him a complete Master of his Art? And tho' I do not insist that
            he ought always to shew himself in these various Lights, yet, before we compliment him
            with that Title, he ought at least, by some few Proofs, to let us see that he has them
            all in his Power. If I am ask'd, who, ever, arriv'd at this imaginary Excellence, I
            confess the Instances are very few; but I will venture to name <hi rend="italic"
            >Monfort</hi> as one of them, whose Theatrical Character I have <pb n="211"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0334"/> given in my last Chapter: For in his Youth he had acted
            Low Humour with great Success, even down to <hi rend="italic">Tallboy</hi> in the <hi
              rend="italic">Jovial Crew;</hi> and when he was in great Esteem as a Tragedian, he
            was, in Comedy, the most complete Gentleman that I ever saw upon the Stage. Let me add,
            too, that <hi rend="italic">Betterton,</hi> in his declining Age, was as eminent in Sir
              <hi rend="italic">John Falstaff,</hi> as in the Vigour of it, in his <hi rend="italic"
              >Othello.</hi></p>
          <p>While I thus measure the Value of an Actor by the Variety of Shapes he is able to throw
            himself into, you may naturally suspect that I am all this while leading my own
            Theatrical Character into your Favour: Why really, to speak as an honest Man, I cannot
            wholly deny it: But in this I shall endeavour to be no farther partial to myself than
            known Facts will make me; from the good or bad Evidence of which your better Judgment
            will condemn or acquit me. And to shew you that I will conceal no Truth that is against
            me, I frankly own that had I been always left to my own choice of Characters, I am
            doubtful whether I might ever had deserv'd an equal Share of that Estimation which the
            Publick seem'd to have held me in: Nor am I sure that it was not Vanity in me often to
            have suspected that I was kept out of the Parts I had most mind to by the Jealousy or
            Prejudice of my Cotemporaries; some Instances of which I could give you, were they not
            too slight to be remember'd: In the mean time, be pleas'd to observe how slowly, in my
            younger Days, my Good-fortune came forward.</p>

          <p>My early Success in the <hi rend="italic">Old Batchelor,</hi> of which I have given so
            full an Account, having open'd no farther way to my Advancement, was enough, perhaps, to
            have made a young Fellow of more Modesty despair; but being of a Temper not easily
            dishearten'd, I resolv'd to leave nothing unattempted that might shew me in some new
            Rank of Distinction. Having then no other Resource, I was at last reduc'd to write a
            Character for myself; but as that was not finish'd till about a Year after, I could not,
            in the Interim, procure any one Part that gave me the least Inclination to act it; and
            consequently such as I got I perform'd with a proportionable Negligence. But this
            Misfortune, if it were one, you are not to wonder at; for the same Fate attended me,
            more or less, to the last Days of my remaining on the Stage. What Defect in me this may
            have been owing to, I have not yet had Sense enough to find out; but I soon found out as
            good a thing, which was, never to be mortify'd at it: Though I am afraid this seeming
            Philosophy was rather owing to my Inclination to Pleasure than Business. But to my
            Point. The next Year I produc'd the Comedy of <hi rend="italic">Love's last Shift;</hi>
            yet the Difficulty of getting it to the Stage was not easily surmounted; for, at that
            time, as little was expected form me, as an Author, as had been from my Pretensions to
            be an Actor. However, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Southern,</hi> the Author of <hi
              rend="italic">Oroonoko,</hi> having had the Patience to hear me read it to him,
            happened to like it so well that he immediately recommended it to the Patentees, <pb
              n="213" entity="DSSR_000002909_0336"/> and it was accordingly acted in <hi
              rend="italic">January</hi> 1695. <ref target="n213-1" n="247">[213.1]</ref> In this
            Play I gave myself the Part of Sir <hi rend="italic">Novelty,</hi> which was thought a
            good Portrait of the Foppery then in fashion. Here, too, Mr. <hi rend="italic"
            >Southern,</hi> though he had approv'd my Play, came into the common Diffidence of me as
            an Actor: For, when on the first Day of it I was standing, myself, to prompt the <hi
              rend="italic">Prologue,</hi> he took me by the Hand and said, <hi rend="italic">Young
              Man! I pronounce thy Play a good one; I will answer for its Success,</hi>
            <ref target="n213-2" n="248">[213.2]</ref>
            <hi rend="italic">if thou dost not spoil it by thy own Action.</hi> Though this might be
            a fair <hi rend="italic">Salvo</hi> for his favourable Judgment of the Play, yet, if it
            were his real Opinion of me as an Actor, I had the good Fortune to deceive him: I
            succeeded so well in both, that People seem'd at a loss which they should give <pb
              n="214" entity="DSSR_000002909_0337"/> the Preference to. <ref target="n214-1" n="249"
              >[214.1]</ref> But (now let me shew a little more Vanity, and my Apology for it shall
            come after) the Compliment which my Lord <hi rend="italic">Dorset</hi> (then
            Lord-Chamberlain) made me upon it is, I own, what I had rather not suppress, <hi
              rend="italic">viz. That it was the best First Play that any Author in his Memory had
              produc'd; and that for a young Fellow to shew himself such an Actor and such a Writer
              in one Day, was something extraordinary.</hi> But as this noble Lord has been
            celebrated for his Good-nature, I am contented that as much of this Compliment should be
            suppos'd to exceed my Deserts as may be imagin'd to have been heighten'd by his generous
            Inclination to encourage a young Beginner. If this Excuse cannot soften the Vanity of
            telling a Truth so much in my own Favour, I must lie at the Mercy of my Reader. But
            there was a still higher Compliment pass'd upon me which I may publish without Vanity,
            because it was not a design'd one, and apparently came from my Enemies, <hi
              rend="italic">viz.</hi> That, to their certain Knowledge, <hi rend="italic">it was not
              my own:</hi> This Report is taken notice of in my Dedication to the Play. <ref
              target="n214-2" n="250">[214.2]</ref> If they spoke Truth, if they knew <pb n="215"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0338"/> what other Person it really belong'd to, I will at
            least allow them true to their Trust; for above forty Years have since past, and they
            have not yet reveal'd the Secret. <ref target="n215-1" n="251">[215.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>The new Light in which the Character of Sir <hi rend="italic">Novelty</hi> had shewn
            me, one might have thought were enough to have dissipated the Doubts of what I might now
            be possibly good for. But to whatever Chance my Ill-fortune was due; whether I had still
            but little Merit, or that the Menagers, if I had any, were not competent Judges of it;
            or whether I was not generally elbow'd by other Actors (which I am most inclin'd to
            think the true Cause) when any fresh Parts were to be dispos'd of, not one Part of any
            consequence was I preferr'd to 'till the Year following: Then, indeed, from Sir <hi
              rend="italic">John Vanbrugh</hi>'s favourable <pb n="216" entity="DSSR_000002909_0339"
            /> Opinion of me, I began, with others, to have a better of myself: For he not only did
            me Honour as an Author by writing his <hi rend="italic">Relapse</hi> as a Sequel or
            Second Part of <hi rend="italic">Love's last Shift,</hi> but as an Actor too, by
            preferring me to the chief Character in his own Play, (which from Sir <hi rend="italic"
              >Novelty</hi>) he had ennobled by the Style of Baron of <hi rend="italic"
            >Foppington.</hi> This Play (the <hi rend="italic">Relapse</hi>) from its new and easy
            Turn of Wit, had great Success, and gave me, as a Comedian, a second Flight of
            Reputation along with it. <ref target="n216-1" n="252">[216.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>As the Matter I write must be very flat or impertinent to those who have no Taste or
            Concern for the Stage, and may to those who delight in it, too, be equally tedious when
            I talk of no body but myself, I shall endeavour to relieve your Patience by a Word or
            two more of this Gentleman, so far as he lent his Pen to the Support of the Theatre.</p>
          <p>Though the <hi rend="italic">Relapse</hi> was the first Play this agreeable Author
            produc'd, yet it was not, it seems, the first he had written; for he had at that time by
            him (more than) all the Scenes that were acted of the <hi rend="italic">Provok'd
            Wife;</hi> but being then doubtful whether he should ever trust them to the Stage, he
            thought no more of it: But after the Success of the <hi rend="italic">Relapse</hi> he
            was more strongly importun'd than able to refuse it <pb n="217"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0340"/> to the Publick. Why the last-written Play was first
            acted, and for what Reason they were given to different Stages, what follows will
            explain.</p>
          <p>In his first Step into publick Life, when he was but an Ensign and had a Heart above
            his Income, he happen'd somewhere at his Winter-Quarters, upon a very slender
            Acquaintance with Sir <hi rend="italic">Thomas Skipwith,</hi> to receive a particular
            Obligation from him which he had not forgot at the Time I am speaking of: When Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Thomas</hi>'s Interest in the Theatrical Patent (for he had a large
            Share in it, though he little concern'd himself in the Conduct of it) was rising but
            very slowly, he thought that to give it a Lift by a new Comedy, if it succeeded, might
            be the handsomest Return he could make to those his former Favours; and having observ'd
            that in <hi rend="italic">Love's last Shift</hi> most of the Actors had acquitted
            themselves beyond what was expected of them, he took a sudden Hint from what he lik'd in
            that Play, and in less than three Months, in the beginning of <hi rend="italic"
            >April</hi> following, brought us the <hi rend="italic">Relapse</hi> finish'd; but the
            Season being then too far advanc'd, it was not acted 'till the succeeding Winter. Upon
            the Success of the <hi rend="italic">Relapse</hi> the late Lord <hi rend="italic"
              >Hallifax,</hi> who was a great Favourer of <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi>'s
            Company, having formerly, by way of Family-Amusement, heard the <hi rend="italic"
              >Provok'd Wife</hi> read to him in its looser Sheets, engag'd Sir <hi rend="italic"
              >John Vanbrugh</hi> to revise it and gave it to the Theatre in <hi rend="italic"
              >Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.</hi> This was a Request not to be refus'd to so eminent a
            Patron of the Muses as the <pb n="218" entity="DSSR_000002909_0341"/> Lord <hi
              rend="italic">Hallifax,</hi> who was equally a Friend and Admirer of Sir <hi
              rend="italic">John</hi> himself. <ref target="n218-1" n="253">[218.1]</ref> Nor was
            Sir <hi rend="italic">Thomas Skipwith</hi> in the least disobliged by so reasonable a
            Compliance: After which, Sir <hi rend="italic">John</hi> was agen at liberty to repeat
            his Civilities to his Friend Sir <hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi>, and about the same time,
            or not long after, gave us the Comedy of <hi rend="italic">&AElig;sop,</hi> for his
            Inclination always led him to serve Sir <hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi>. Besides, our
            Company about this time began to be look'd upon in another Light; the late Contempt we
            had lain under was now wearing off, and from the Success of two or three new Plays, our
            Actors, by being Originals in a few good Parts where they had not the Disadvantage of
            Comparison against them, sometimes found new Favour in those old Plays where others had
            exceeded them. <ref target="n218-2" n="254">[218.2]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>Of this Good-fortune perhaps I had more than my Share from the two very different chief
            Characters I had succeeded in; for I was equally approv'd in <hi rend="italic"
              >&AElig;sop</hi> as the <hi rend="italic">Lord Foppington,</hi> allowing the
            Difference to be no less than as Wisdom in a Person deform'd may be less entertaining to
            the general Taste than <pb n="219" entity="DSSR_000002909_0342"/> Folly and Foppery
            finely drest: For the Character that delivers Precepts of Wisdom is, in some sort,
            severe upon the Auditor by shewing him one wiser than himself. But when Folly is his
            Object he applauds himself for being wiser than the Coxcomb he laughs at: And who is not
            more pleas'd with an Occasion to commend than accuse himself?</p>
          <p>Though to write much in a little time is no Excuse for writing ill; yet Sir <hi
              rend="italic">John Vanbrugh</hi>'s Pen is not to be a little admir'd for its Spirit,
            Ease, and Readiness in producing Plays so fast upon the Neck of one another; for,
            notwithstanding this quick Dispatch, there is a clear and lively Simplicity in his Wit
            that neither wants the Ornament of Learning nor has the least Smell of the Lamp in it.
            As the Face of a fine Woman, with only her Locks loose about her, may be then in its
            greatest Beauty; such were his Productions, only adorn'd by Nature. There is something
            so catching to the Ear, so easy to the Memory, in all he writ, that it has been observ'd
            by all the Actors of my Time, that the Style of no Author whatsoever gave their Memory
            less trouble than that of Sir <hi rend="italic">John Vanbrugh;</hi> which I myself, who
            have been charg'd with several of his strongest Characters, can confirm by a pleasing
            Experience. And indeed his Wit and Humour was so little laboured, that his most
            entertaining Scenes seem'd to be no more than his common Conversation committed to
            Paper. Here I confess my Judgment at a Loss, whether in this I give him more or less <pb
              n="220" entity="DSSR_000002909_0343"/> than his due Praise? For may it not be more
            laudable to raise an Estate (whether in Wealth or Fame) by Pains and honest Industry
            than to be born to it? Yet if his Scenes really were, as to me they always seem'd,
            delightful, are they not, thus expeditiously written, the more surprising? let the Wit
            and Merit of them then be weigh'd by wiser Criticks than I pretend to be: But no wonder,
            while his Conceptions were so full of Life and Humour, his Muse should be sometimes too
            warm to wait the slow Pace of Judgment, or to endure the Drudgery of forming a regular
            Fable to them: Yet we see the <hi rend="italic">Relapse,</hi> however imperfect in the
            Conduct, by the mere Force of its agreeable Wit, ran away with the Hearts of its
            Hearers; while <hi rend="italic">Love's last Shift,</hi> which (as Mr. <hi rend="italic"
              >Congreve</hi> justly said of it) had only in it a great many things that were <hi
              rend="italic">like</hi> Wit, that in reality were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> Wit: And
            what is still less pardonable (as I say of it myself) has a great deal of Puerility and
            frothy Stage-Language in it, yet by the mere moral Delight receiv'd from its Fable, it
            has been, with the other, in a continued and equal Possession of the Stage for more than
            forty Years. <ref target="n220-1" n="255">[220.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>As I have already promis'd you to refer your Judgment of me as an Actor rather to known
            Facts than my own Opinion (which I could not be sure would keep clear of
            Self-Partiality) I must a little farther risque my being tedious to be as good as my
            Word. <pb n="221" entity="DSSR_000002909_0344"/> I have elsewhere allow'd that my want
            of a strong and full Voice soon cut short my Hopes of making any valuable Figure in
            Tragedy; and I have been many Years since convinced, that whatever Opinion I might have
            of my own Judgment of Capacity to amend the palpable Errors that I saw our Tragedians
            most in favour commit; yet the Auditors who would have been sensible of any such
            Amendments (could I have made them) were so very few, that my best Endeavour would have
            been but an unavailing Labour, or, what is yet worse, might have appeared both to our
            Actors and to many Auditors the vain Mistake of my own Self-Conceit: For so strong, so
            very near indispensible, is that one Article of Voice in the forming a good Tragedian,
            than an Actor may want any other Qualification whatsoever, and yet have a better chance
            for Applause than he will ever have, with all the Skill in the World, if his Voice is
            not equal to it. Mistake me not; I say, for <hi rend="italic">Applause</hi>
            only&mdash;but Applause does not always stay for, nor always follow instrinsick
            Merit; Applause will frequently open, like a young Hound, upon a wrong Scent; and the
            Majority of Auditors, you know, are generally compos'd of Babblers that are profuse of
            their Voices before there is any thing on foot that calls for them. Not but, I grant, to
            lead or mislead the Many will always stand in some Rank of a necessary Merit; yet when I
            say a good Tragedian, I mean one in Opinion of whose <hi rend="italic">real</hi> Merit
            the best Judges would agree.</p>
          <pb n="222" entity="DSSR_000002909_0345"/>
          <p>Having to far given up my Pretensions to the Buskin, I ought now to account for my
            having been, notwithstanding, so often seen in some particular Characters in Tragedy, as
              <hi rend="italic">Jago,</hi>
            <ref target="n222-1" n="256">[222.1]</ref>
            <hi rend="italic">Wolsey, Syphax, Richard the Third,</hi> &amp;c. If in any of this
            kind I have succeeded, perhaps it has been a Merit dearly purchas'd; for, from the
            Delight I seem'd to take in my performing them, half my Auditors have been persuaded
            that a great Share of the Wickedness of them must have been in my own Nature: If this is
            true, as true I fear (I had almost said hope) it is, I look upon i rather as a Praise
            than Censure of my Performance. Aversion there is an involuntary Commendation, where we
            are only hated for being like the thing we <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be like; a
            sort of Praise, however, which few Actors besides my self could endure: Had it been
            equal to the usual Praise given to Virtue, my Cotemporaries would have thought
            themselves injur'd if I had pretended to any Share of it: So that you see it has been as
            much the Dislike others had to them, as Choice that has thrown me sometimes into these
            Characters. But it may be farther observ'd, that in the Characters I have nam'd, where
            there is so much close meditated <pb n="223" entity="DSSR_000002909_0346"/> Mischief,
            Deceit, Pride, Insolence, or Cruelty, they cannot have the least Cast or Profer of the
            Amiable in them; consequently, there can be no great Demand for that harmonious Sound,
            or pleasing round Melody of Voice, which in the softer Sentiments of Love, the Wailings
            of distressful Virtue, or in the Throws and Swellings of Honour and Ambition, may be
            needful to recommend them to our Pity or Admiration: So that, again, my want of that
            requisite Voice might less disqualify me for the vicious than the virtuous Character.
            This too may have been a more favourable Reason for my having been chosen for
            them&mdash;a yet farther Consideration that inclin'd me to them was that they are
            generally better written, thicker sown with sensible Reflections, and come by so much
            nearer to common Life and Nature than Characters of Admiration, as Vice is more the
            Practice of Mankind than Virtue: Nor could I sometimes help smiling at those dainty
            Actors that were too squeamish to swallow them! as if they were one Jot the better Men
            for acting a good Man well, or another Man the worse for doing equal Justice to a bad
            one! 'Tis not, sure, <hi rend="italic">what</hi> we act, but <hi rend="italic">how</hi>
            we act what is allotted us, that speaks our intrinsick Value! as in real Life, the wise
            Man or the Fool, be he Prince or Peasant, will in either State be equally the Fool or
            the wise Man&mdash;but alas! in personated Life this is no Rule to the Vulgar! they
            are apt to think all before them real, and rate the Actor according to his borrow'd Vice
            or Virtue.</p>
          <pb n="224" entity="DSSR_000002909_0347"/>
          <p>If then I had always too careless a Concern for false or vulgar Applause, I ought not
            to complain if I have had less of it than others of my time, or not less of it than I
            desired: Yet I will venture to say, that from the common weak Appetite of false
            Applause, many Actors have run into more Errors and Absurdities, than their greatest
            Ignorance could otherwise have committed: <ref target="n224-1" n="257">[224.1]</ref> If
            this Charge is true, it will lie chiefly upon the better Judgment of the Spectator to
            reform it.</p>
          <p>But not to make too great a Merit of my avoiding this common Road to Applause, perhaps
            I was vain enough to think I had more ways than one to come at it. That, in the Variety
            of Characters I acted, the Chances to win it were the stronger on my Side
            &mdash;That, if the Multitude were not in a Roar to see me in <hi rend="italic"
              >Cardinal Wolsey,</hi> I could be sure of them in Alderman <hi rend="italic"
              >Fondlewife.</hi> If they hated me in <hi rend="italic">Jago,</hi> in Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Fopling</hi> they took me for a fine Gentleman; if they were silent at
              <hi rend="italic">Syphax,</hi> no <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> Eunuch was more
            applauded than when I sung in Sir <hi rend="italic">Courtly.</hi> If the Morals of <hi

            <p> The original holders of the Patents, Sir William Davenant and Thomas Killigrew, were
              dead in 1690; and their successors, Alexander Davenant, to whom Charles Davenant had
              assigned his interest, and Charles Killigrew, seem to have taken little active
              interest in the management; for Christopher Rich, who acquired Davenant's share in

            <p> Davies ("Dramatic Miscellanies," iii. 444) gives the following account of Cibber's
              first salary: "But Mr. Richard Cross, late prompter of Drury-lane theatre, gave me the
              following history of Colley Cibber's first establishment as a hired actor. He was
              known only, for some years, by the name of Master Colley. After waiting impatiently a
              long time for the prompter's notice, by good fortune he obtained the honour of
              carrying a message on the stage, in some play, to Betterton. Whatever was the cause,
              Master Colley was so terrified, that the scene was disconcerted by him. Betterton
              asked, in some anger, who the young fellow was that had committed the blunder. Downes
              replied, 'Master Colley.'&mdash;'Master Colley! then forfeit him.'&mdash;'Why,
              sir, said the prompter, 'he has no salary.'&mdash;'No!' said the old man; 'why
              then put him down ten shillings a week, and forfeit him 5<hi rend="italic"

            <p> Complexion is a point of no importance now, and this allusion suggests a theory to
              me which I give with all diffidence. We know that actresses painted in Pepys's time
              ("1667, Oct. 5. But, Lord! To see how they [Nell Gwynne and Mrs. Knipp] were both
              painted would make a man mad, and did make me loathe them"), and we also know that
              Dogget was famous for the painting of his face to represent old age. If, then,
              complexion was a point of importance for a lover, as Cibber states, it suggests that
              young actors playing juvenile parts did not use any "make-up" or paint, but went on
              the stage in their natural complexion. The lighting of the stage was of course much
              less brilliant than it afterwards became, so that "make-up" was not so necessary.</p>

            <p> "The Laureat" (p. 103) describes Cibber's person thus:&mdash;"He was in Stature

            <p> Of Cibber's wife there is little record. In 1695 the name of "Mrs. Cibbars" appears
              to the part of Galatea in "Philaster," and she was the original Hillaria in Cibber's
              "Live's Last Shift" in 1696; but she never made any great name or played any famous
              part. She was a Miss Shore, sister of John Shore, "Sergeant-trumpet" of England. The
              "Biographia Dramatica" (i. 117) says that Miss Shore's father was extremely angry at
              her marriage, and spent that portion of his fortune which he had intended for her in
              building a retreat on the Thames which was called Shore's Folly.</p>

            <p> Bellchambers has here the following notes, the entire substance of which will be
              found in Malone ("Shakespeare," 1821, iii. 170, <hi rend="italic">et. seq.</hi>): "In
              Shakspeare's time the nightly expenses for lights, supernumeraries, etc., was but
              forty-five shillings, and having deducted this charge, the clear emoluments were
              divided into shares, (supposed to be forty in number,) between the proprietors, and
              principal actors. In the year 1666, the whole profit arising from acting plays,
              masques, etc., at the King's theatre, was divided into twelve shares and three
              quarters, of which Mr. Killegrew, the manager, had two shares and three quarters, each
              share computed to produce about <hi rend="italic">&pound;</hi>250, net, per annum.
              In Sir William D'Avenant's company, from the time their new theatre was opened in
              Portugal-row, the total receipt, after deducting the nightly expenses, was divided
              into fifteen shares, of which it was agreed that ten should belong to D'Avenant, for
              various purposes, and the remainder be divided among the male members of his troops
              according to their rank and merit. I cannot relate the arrangement adopted by
              Betterton in Lincoln's-inn-fields, but the share accepted by Congreve was, doubtless,
              presumed to be of considerable value.</p>
            <p>"Dryden had a share and a quarter in the king's company, for which he bound himself
              to furnish not two, but three plays every season. The following paper, which, after
              remaining long in the Killegrew family, came into the hands of the late Mr. Reed, and
              was published by Mr. Malone in his 'Historical Account of the English Stage,'
              incontestably proves the practice alluded to. The superscription is lost, but it was
              probably addressed to the lord-chamberlain, or the king, about the year 1678,
              '&OElig;dipus,' the ground of complaint, being printed in 1679:</p>
            <p>"'Whereas upon Mr. Dryden's binding himself to write three playes a yeere, hee the
              said Mr. Dryden was admitted and continued as a sharer in the king's playhouse for
              diverse years, and received for his share and a quarter three or four hundred pounds,
              communibus annis; but though he received the moneys, we received not the playes, not
              one in a yeare. After which, the house being burnt, the company in building another,
              contracted great debts, so that shares fell much short of what they were formerly.
              Thereupon Mr. Dryden complaining to the company of his want of proffit, the company
              was so king to him that they not only did not presse him for the playes which he so
              engaged to write for them, and for which he was paid beforehand, but they did also at
              his earnest request give him a third day for his last new play called <hi
                rend="italic">All for Love;</hi> and at the receipt of the money of the said third
              day, he acknowledged it as a guift, and a particular kindnesse of the company. Yet
              notwithstanding this kind proceeding, Mr. Dryden has now, jointly with Mr. Lee, (who
              was in pension with us to the last day of our playing, and shall continue,) written a
              play called <hi rend="italic">Oedipus,</hi> and given it to the Duke's company,
              contrary to his said agreement, his promise, and all gratitude, to the great prejudice
              and almost undoing of the company, they being the only poets remaining to us. Mr.
              Crowne, being under the like agreement with the duke's house, writt a play called <hi
                rend="italic">The Destruction of Jerusalem,</hi> and being forced by their refusall
              of it, to bring it to us, the said company compelled us, after the studying of it, and
              a vast expence in scenes and cloaths, to buy off their clayme, by paying all the
              pension he had received from them, amounting to one hundred and twelve pounds paid by
              the king's company, besides near forty pounds he the said Mr. Crowne paid out of his
              owne pocket.</p>
            <p>"'These things considered, if notwithstanding Mr. Dryden's said agreement, promise,
              and moneys freely giving him for his said last new play, and the many titles we have
              to his writings, this play be judged away from us, we must submit.</p>

              evidently a personal dislike to Powell&mdash;everything therefore that he says,
              directly or indirectly, against him must be received with some grains of
              allowance&mdash;Powell seems to have been eager to exhibit himself in some of
              Betterton's best parts, whereas a more diffident actor would have wished to avoid
              comparisons&mdash;we know from the Spectator that Powell was too apt to tear a
              passion to tatters, but still he must have been an actor of considerable reputation at
              this time, or he would not have been cast for several good parts before the division

            <p> Davies ("Dram. Misc.," iii. 437) says: "So little was hoped from the genius of
              Cibber, that the critics reproached him with stealing his play. To his censurers he
              makes a serious defence of himself, in his dedication to Richard Norton, Esq., of
              Southwick, a gentleman who was so fond of stage-plays and players, that he has been
              accused of turning his chapel into a theatre. The furious John Dennis, who hated
              Cibber for obstructing, as he imagined, the progress of his tragedy called the Invader
              of his Country, in very passionate terms denies his claim to this comedy: 'When the
              Fool in Fashion was first acted (says the critic) Cibber was hardly twenty years of
              age&mdash;how could he, at the age of twenty, write a comedy with a just design,
              distinguished characters, and a proper dialogue, who now, at forty, treats us with
              Hibernian sense and Hibernian English?'"</p>

            <p> This same accusation was made against Cibber on other occasions. Dr. Johnson,

            <p> Davies praises Cibber in Fondlewife, saying that he "was much and justly admired and
              applauded" ("Dram. Misc.," iii. 391); and in the same work ( i.306) he gives an
              admirable sketch of Cibber as Justice Shallow:&mdash;</p>
            <p>"Whether he was a copy or an original in Shallow, it is certain no audience was ever
              more fixed in deep attention, at his first appearance, or more shaken with laughter in
              the progress of the scene, than at Colley Cibber's exhibition of this ridiculous
              justice of peace. Some years after he had left the stage, he acted Shallow for his
              son's benefit. I believe in 1737, when Quin was the Falstaff, and Milward the King.
              Whether it was owing to the pleasure the spectators felt on seeing their old friend
              return to them again, <hi rend="italic">though for that night only,</hi> after an
              absence of some years, I know not; but, surely, no actor of audience were better
              pleased with each other. His manner was so perfectly simple, his look so vacant, when
              he questioned his cousin Silence about the price of ewes, and lamented, in the same
              breath, with silly surprise, the death of Old Double, that it will be impossible for
              any surviving spectator not to smile at the remembrance of it. The want of ideas
              occasions Shallow to repeat almost every thing he says. Cibber's transition, from
              asking the price of bullocks, to trite, but grave reflections on mortality, was so
              natural, and attended with such an unmeaning roll of his small pigs-eyes, accompanied
              with an important utterance of tick! tick! tick! not much louder than the balance of a
              watch, that I question if any actor was ever superior in the conception or expression
              of such solemn insignificancy."</p>

            supposed more expensive in Dress than possibly one of Ambition, yet the high Heart of
            this heroical Actor could not bear that a Comedian should ever pretend to be as well
            dress'd as himself. Thus again, on the contrary, when <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi>
            proposed to set off a Tragedy, the Comedians were sure to murmur at the Charge of it:
            And the late Reputation which <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> had acquired from acting his
              <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Love</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
            >Love,</hi> made him a more declared Male-content on such Occasions; he over-valued
            Comedy for its being nearer to Nature than Tragedy, which is allow'd to say many fine
            things that Nature never spoke in the same Words; and supposing his Opinion were just,
            yet he should have consider'd that the Publick had a Taste as well as himself, which in

            with Patience look upon the costly Trains and Plumes of Tragedy, in which knowing

            <pb n="230" entity="DSSR_000002909_0353"/> an arch Valet, quite after the <hi
              rend="italic">French</hi> cast, pert and familiar. But it suited so ill with <hi
              rend="italic">Dogget</hi>'s dry and closely-natural Manner of acting, that upon the
            second Day he desired it might be disposed of to another; which the Author complying
            with, gave it to <hi rend="italic">Penkethman,</hi> who, tho' in other Lights much his
            Inferior, yet this Part he seem'd better to become. <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> was so
            immovable in his Opinion of whatever he thought was right or wrong, that he could never
            be easy under any kind of Theatrical Government, and was generally so warm in pursuit of
            his Interest that he often out-ran it; I remember him three times, for some Years,
            unemploy'd in any Theatre, from his not being able to bear, in common with others, the
            disagreeable Accidents that in such Societies are unavoidable. <ref target="n230-1"
              n="262">[230.1]</ref> But whatever Pretences he had form'd for this first deserting
            from <hi rend="italic">Lincoln's-Inn-Fields,</hi> I always thought his best Reason for
            it was, that he look'd upon it as a sinking Ship; not only from the melancholy Abatement
            of their Profits, but likewise from the Neglect and Disorder in their Government: He
            plainly saw that their extraordinary Success at first had made them too confident of its
            Duration, and from thence had slacken'd their Industry&mdash;by which he observ'd,
            at the same time, the old House, where <pb n="231" entity="DSSR_000002909_0354"/> there
            was scarce any other Merit than Industry, began to flourish. And indeed they seem'd not
            enough to consider that the Appetite of the Publick, like that of a fine Gentleman,
            could only be kept warm by Variety; that let their Merit be never so high, yet the Taste
            of a Town was not always constant, nor infallible: That it was dangerous to hold their
            Rivals in too much Contempt; <ref target="n231-1" n="263">[231.1]</ref> for they found
            that a young industrious Company were soon a Match for the best Actors when too securely
            negligent: And negligent they certainly were, and fondly fancied that had each of their
            different Schemes been follow'd, their Audiences would not so suddenly have fallen off.
              <ref target="n231-2" n="264">[231.2]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>But alas! the Vanity of applauded Actors, when they are not crowded to as they may have
            been, makes them naturally impute the Change to any Cause rather than the true one,
            Satiety: They are mighty loath to think a Town, once so fond of them, could ever be
            tired; and yet, at one time or other, more or less thin Houses have been the certain
            Fate <pb n="232" entity="DSSR_000002909_0355"/> of the most prosperous Actors ever since
            I remember the Stage! But against this Evil the provident Patentees had found out a
            Relief which the new House were not yet Masters of, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Never to
            pay their People when the Money did not come in; nor then neither, but in such
            Proportions as suited their Conveniency. I my self was one of the many who for six
            acting Weeks together never received one Day's Pay; and for some Years after seldom had
            above half our nominal Sallaries: But to the best of my Memory, the Finances of the
            other House held it not above one Season more, before they were reduced to the same
            Expedient of making the like scanty Payments. <ref target="n232-1" n="265">[232.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>Such was the Distress and Fortune of both these Companies since their Division from the
              <hi rend="italic">Theatre-Royal</hi>; either working at half Wages, or by alternate
            Successes intercepting the Bread from one another's Mouths; <ref target="n232-2" n="266"
              >[232.2]</ref> irreconcilable Enemies, yet without Hope <pb n="233"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0356"/> of Relief from a Victory on either Side; sometimes both
            Parties reduced, and yet each supporting their Spirits by seeing the other under the
            same Calamity.</p>
          <p>During this State of the Stage it was that the lowest Expedient was made use of to
            ingratiate our Company in the Publick Favour: Our Master, who had sometime practised the
            Law, <ref target="n233-1" n="267">[233.1]</ref> and therefore loved a Storm better than
            fair Weather (for it was his own Conduct chiefly that had brought the Patent into these
            Dangers) took nothing so much to Heart as that Partiality wherewith he imagined the
            People of Quality had preferr'd the Actors of the other House to those of his own: To
            ballance this Misfortune, he was resolv'd, at least, to be well with their Domesticks,
            and therefore cunningly open'd the upper Gallery to them <hi rend="italic">gratis:</hi>
            For before this time no Footman was ever admitted, or had presum'd to come into it, till
            after the fourth Act was ended: This additional Privilege (the greatest Plague that ever
            Play-house had to complain of) he conceived would not only incline them to give us a
            good Word in the respective Families they belong'd to, but would naturally incite them
            to come all Hands aloft in the Crack <pb n="234" entity="DSSR_000002909_0357"/> of our
            Applauses: And indeed it so far succeeded, that it often thunder'd from the full Gallery
            above, while our thin Pit and Boxes below were in the utmost Serenity. This riotous
            Privilege, so craftily given, and which from Custom was at last ripen'd into Right,
            became the most disgraceful Nusance that ever depreciated the Theatre. <ref
              target="n234-1" n="268">[234.1]</ref> How often have the most polite Audiences, in the
            most affecting Scenes of the best Plays, been disturb'd and insulted by the Noise and
            Clamour of these savage Spectators? From the same narrow way of thinking, too, were so
            many ordinary People and unlick'd Cubs of Condition admitted behind our Scenes for
            Money, and sometimes without it: The Plagues and Inconveniences of which Custom we found
            so intolerable, when we afterwards had the Stage in our Hands, that at the Hazard of our
            Lives we were forced to get rid of them; and our only Expedient was by refusing Money
            from all Persons without Distinction at the Stage-Door; by this means we preserved to
            ourselves the Right and Liberty of chusing our own Company there: And by a strict
            Observance of this Order we brought what had been before debas'd into all the Licenses
            of a Lobby into the Decencies of a Drawing-Room. <ref target="n234-2" n="269"

          <p>About the distressful Time I was speaking of, in the Year 1696, <ref target="n235-1"
              n="270">[235.1]</ref>
            <hi rend="italic">Wilks,</hi> who now had been five Years in great Esteem on the <hi
              rend="italic">Dublin</hi> Theatre, return'd to that of <hi rend="italic"
            >Drury-Lane</hi>; in which last he had first set out, and had continued to act some
            small Parts for one Winter only. The considerable Figure which he so lately made upon
            the Stage in <hi rend="italic">London,</hi> makes me imagine that a particular Account
            of his first commencing Actor may not be unacceptable to the Curious; I shall,
            therefore, give it them as I had it from his own Mouth.</p>
          <p>In King <hi rend="italic">James</hi>'s Reign he had been some time employ'd in the
            Secretary's Office in <hi rend="italic">Ireland</hi> (his native Country) and remain'd
            in it till after the Battle of the <hi rend="italic">Boyn,</hi> which completed the
            Revolution. Upon that happy and unexpected Deliverance, the People of <hi rend="italic"
              >Dublin</hi>, among the various Expressions of their Joy, had a mind to have a Play;
            but the Actors being dispersed during the War, some private Persons agreed in the best
            Manner they were able to give one to the Publick <hi rend="italic">gratis</hi> at the
              <hi rend="italic">Theatre.</hi> The Play was <hi rend="italic">Othello,</hi> in which
              <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> acted the <hi rend="italic">Moor</hi>; and the Applause
            he received in it warm'd him to so strong an Inclination for the Stage, that he
            immediately <pb n="236" entity="DSSR_000002909_0359"/> prefer'd it to all his other
            Views in Life: for he quitted his Post, and with the first fair Occasion came over to
            try his Fortune in the (then only) Company of Actors in <hi rend="italic">London</hi>.
            The Person who supply'd his Post in <hi rend="italic">Dublin,</hi> he told me, raised to
            himself from thence a Fortune of fifty thousand Pounds. Here you have a much stronger
            Instance of an extravagant Passion for the Stage than that which I have elsewhere shewn
            in my self; I only quitted my <hi rend="italic">Hopes</hi> of being preferr'd to the
            like Post for it; but <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> quitted his actual <hi rend="italic"
              >Possession</hi> for the imaginary Happiness which the Life of an Actor presented to
            him. And, though possibly we might both have better'd our Fortunes in a more honourable
            Station, yet whether better Fortunes might have equally gratify'd our Vanity (the
            universal Passion of Mankind) may admit of a Question.</p>
          <p>Upon his being formerly received into the <hi rend="italic">Theatre-Royal</hi> (which
            was in the Winter after I had been initiated) his Station there was much upon the same
            Class with my own; our Parts were generally of an equal Insignificancy, not of
            consequence enough to give either a Preference: But <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> being
            more impatient of his low Condition than I was, (and, indeed, the Company was then so
            well stock'd with good Actors that there was very little hope of getting forward) laid
            hold of a more expeditious way for his Advancement, and returned agen to <hi
              rend="italic">Dublin</hi> with Mr. <hi rend="italic">Ashbury,</hi> the Patentee of
            that Theatre, to act in his new Company there: There went with him at the same time <pb
              n="237" entity="DSSR_000002909_0360"/> Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Butler</hi>, whose
            Character I have already given, and <hi rend="italic">Estcourt,</hi> who had not
            appeared on any Stage, and was yet only known as an excellent Mimick: <hi rend="italic"
              >Wilks</hi> having no Competitor in <hi rend="italic">Dublin,</hi> was immediately
            preferr'd to whatever parts his Inclination led him, and his early Reputation on that
            Stage as soon raised in him an Ambition to shew himself on a better. And I have heard
            him say (in Raillery of the Vanity which young Actors are liable to) that when the News
            of <hi rend="italic">Monfort</hi>'s Death came to <hi rend="italic">Ireland,</hi> he
            from that time thought his Fortune was made, and took a Resolution to return a second
            time to <hi rend="italic">England</hi> with the first Opportunity; but as his
            Engagements to the Stage where he was were too strong to be suddenly broke from, he
            return'd not to the <hi rend="italic">Theatre-Royal</hi> 'till the Year 1696. <ref
              target="n237-1" n="271">[237.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>Upon his first Arrival, <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi>, who was now in Possession of all
            the chief Parts of <hi rend="italic">Monfort,</hi> and the only Actor that stood in <hi
              rend="italic">Wilks</hi>'s way, in seeming Civility offer'd him his choice of whatever
            he thought fit to make his first Appearance in; though, in reality, the Favour was
            intended to hurt him. But <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> rightly judg'd it more modest to
            accept only of a Part of <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi>'s, and which <hi rend="italic"
              >Monfort</hi> had never acted, that of <hi rend="italic">Palamede</hi> in <hi
              rend="italic">Dryden</hi>'s <hi rend="italic">Marriage Alamode.</hi> Here, too, he had
            the Advantage of having the Ball play'd into his Hand by the inimitable Mrs. <hi
              rend="italic">Monfort,</hi> who was then his <hi rend="italic">Melantha</hi> in the
            same Play: Whatever Fame <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> had brought <pb n="238"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0361"/> with him from <hi rend="italic">Ireland</hi>, he as yet
            appear'd but a very raw Actor to what he was afterwards allow'd to be: His Faults,
            however, I shall rather leave to the Judgments of those who then may remember him, than
            to take upon me the disagreeable Office of being particular upon them, farther than by
            saying, that in this Part of <hi rend="italic">Palamede</hi> he was short of <hi
              rend="italic">Powel</hi>, and miss'd a good deal of the loose Humour of the Character,
            which the other more happily hit. <ref target="n238-1" n="272">[238.1]</ref> But however
            he was young, erect, of a pleasing Aspect, and, in the whole, gave the Town and the
            Stage sufficient Hopes of him. I ought to make some Allowances, too, for the Restraint
            he must naturally have been under from his first Appearance upon a new Stage. But from
            that he soon recovered, and grew daily more in Favour, not only of the Town, but
            likewise of the Patentee, whom <hi rend="italic">Powel,</hi> before <hi rend="italic"
              >Wilks</hi>'s Arrival, had treated in almost what manner he pleas'd.</p>
          <p>Upon this visible Success of <hi rend="italic">Wilks,</hi> the pretended Contempt which
              <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi> had held him in began to sour into an open Jealousy; he
            now plainly saw he was a formidable Rival, and (which more hurt him) saw, too, that
            other People saw it; and therefore found it high time to oppose and be troublesome to
            him. But <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> happening to be as jealous of his <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0362"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0363"/>

            <pb n="239" entity="DSSR_000002909_0366"/> Fame as the other, you may imagine such
            clashing Candidates could not be long without a Rupture: In short, a Challenge, I very
            well remember, came from <hi rend="italic">Powel,</hi> when he was hot-headed; but the
            next Morning he was cool enough to let it end in favour of <hi rend="italic">Wilks.</hi>
            Yet however the Magnanimity on either Part might subside, the Animosity was as deep in
            the Heart as ever, tho' it was not afterwards so openly avow'd: For when <hi
              rend="italic">Powel</hi> found that intimidating would not carry his Point; but that
              <hi rend="italic">Wilks,</hi> when provok'd, would really give Battle, <ref
              target="n239-1" n="273">[239.1]</ref> he (<hi rend="italic">Powel</hi>) grew so out of
            Humour that he cock'd his Hat, and in his Passion walk'd off to the Service of the
            Company in <hi rend="italic">Lincoln's-Inn Fields.</hi> But there finding more
            Competitors, and that he made a worse Figure among them than in the Company he came
            from, he stay'd but one Winter with them <ref target="n239-2" n="274">[239.2]</ref>
            before he return'd to his old Quarters in <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi>; where,
            after these unsuccessful Pushes of his Ambition, he at last became a Martyr to
            Negligence, and quietly submitted to the Advantages and Superiority which (during his
            late Desertion) <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> had more easily got over him.</p>
          <pb n="240" entity="DSSR_000002909_0367"/>
          <p>However trifling these Theatrical Anecdotes may seem to a sensible Reader, yet, as the
            different Conduct of these rival Actors may be of use to others of the same Profession,
            and from thence may contribute to the Pleasure of the Publick, let that be my Excuse for
            pursuing them. I must therefore let it be known that, though in Voice and Ear Nature had
            been more kind to <hi rend="italic">Powel,</hi> yet he so often lost the Value of them
            by an unheedful Confidence, that the constant wakeful Care and Decency of <hi
              rend="italic">Wilks</hi> left the other far behind in the publick Esteem and
            Approbation. Nor was his Memory less tenacious than that of <hi rend="italic"
            >Wilks</hi>; but <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi> put too much Trust in it, and idly
            deferr'd the Studying of his Parts, as School-boys do their Exercise, to the last Day,
            which commonly brings them out proportionably defective. But <hi rend="italic"
            >Wilks</hi> never lost an Hour of precious Time, and was, in all his Parts, perfect to
            such an Exactitude, that I question if in forty Years he ever five times chang'd or
            misplac'd an Article in any one of them. To be Master of this uncommon Diligence is
            adding to the Gift of Nature all that is in an Actor's Power; and this Duty of Studying
            perfect whatever Actor is remiss in, he will proportionably find that Nature may have
            been kind to him in vain, for though <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi> had an Assurance that
            cover'd this Neglect much better than a Man of more Modesty might have done, yet, with
            all his Intrepidity, very often the Diffidence and Concern for what he was to <hi
              rend="italic">say</hi> made him lose the Look of what he was to <hi rend="italic"
            >be:</hi> While, therefore <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi>
            <pb n="241" entity="DSSR_000002909_0368"/> presided, his idle Example made this Fault so
            common to others, that I cannot but confess, in the general Infection, I had my Share of
            it; nor was my too critical Excuse for it a good one, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> That
            scarce one Part in five that fell to my Lot was worth the Labour. But to shew Respect to
            an Audience is worth the best Actor's Labour, and, his Business consider'd, he must be a
            very impudent one that comes before them with a conscious Negligence of what he is
            about. <ref target="n241-1" n="275">[241.1]</ref> But <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> was
            never known to make any of these venial Distinctions, nor, however barren his Part might
            be, could bear even the Self-Reproach of favouring his Memory: And I have been
            astonished to see him swallow a Volume of Froth and Insipidity in a new Play that we
            were <pb n="242" entity="DSSR_000002909_0369"/> sure could not live above three Days,
            tho' favour'd and recommended to the Stage by some good person of Quality. Upon such
            Occasions, in Compassion to his fruitless Toil and Labour, I have sometimes cry'd out
            with <hi rend="italic">Cato&mdash;Painful Pr&aelig;eminence!</hi> So
            insupportable, in my Sense, was the Task, when the bare Praise of not having been
            negligent was sure to be the only Reward of it. But so indefatigable was the Diligence
            of <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>, that he seem'd to love it, as a good Man does Virtue,
            for its own sake; of which the following Instance will give you an extraordinary Proof.</p>
          <p>In some new Comedy he happen'd to complain of a crabbed Speech in his Part, which, he
            said, gave him more trouble to study than all the rest of it had done; upon which he
            apply'd to the Author either to soften or shorten it. The Author, that he might make the
            Matter quite easy to him, fairly cut it all out. But when he got home from the
            Rehearsal, <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> thought it such an Indignity to his Memory that
            any thing should be thought too hard for it, that he actually made himself perfect in
            that Speech, though he knew it was never to be made use of. From this singular Act of
            Supererogation you may judge how indefatigable the Labour of his Memory must have been
            when his Profit and Honour were more concern'd to make use of it. <ref target="n242-1"

          <p>But besides this indispensable Quality of Diligence, <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> had
            the Advantage of a sober Character in private Life, which <hi rend="italic">Powel,</hi>
            not having the least Regard to, labour'd under the unhappy Disfavour, not to say
            Contempt, of the Publick, to whom his licentious Courses were no Secret: Even when he
            did well that natural Prejudice pursu'd him; neither the Heroe nor the Gentleman, the
            young <hi rend="italic">Ammon</hi>
            <ref target="n243-1" n="277">[243.1]</ref> nor the <hi rend="italic">Dorimant,</hi><ref
              target="n243-2" n="278">[243.2]</ref> could conceal from the conscious Spectator the
            True <hi rend="italic">George Powel.</hi> And this sort of Disesteem or Favour every

            or has <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, a due Regard to his private Life and Reputation. Nay,
            even false Reports shall affect him, and become the Cause, or Pretence at least, of
            undervaluing or treating him injuriously. Let me give a known Instance of it, and at the
            same time a Justification of myself from an Imputation that was laid upon me not many
            Years before I quitted the Theatre, of which you will see the Consequence.</p>
          <p>After the vast Success of that new Species of Dramatick Poetry, the <hi rend="italic"
              >Beggars Opera,</hi>
            <ref target="n243-3" n="279">[243.3]</ref> The Year following I was so stupid as to
            attempt something of the same Kind, upon a quite different Foundation, that <pb n="244"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0371"/> of recommending Virtue and Innocence; which I
            ignorantly thought might not have a less Pretence to Favour than setting Greatness and
            Authority in a contemptible, and the most vulgar Vice and Wickedness, in an amiable
            Light. But behold how fondly I was mistaken! <hi rend="italic">Love in a Riddle</hi>
            <ref target="n244-1" n="280">[244.1]</ref> (for so my new-fangled Performance was
            called) was as vilely damn'd and hooted at as so vain a Presumption in the idle Cause of
            Virtue could deserve. Yet this <pb n="245" entity="DSSR_000002909_0372"/> is not what I
            complain of; I will allow my Poetry to be as much below the other as Taste or Criticism
            can sink it: I will grant likewise that the applauded Author of the <hi rend="italic"
              >Beggars Opera</hi> (whom I knew to be an honest good-natur'd Man, and who, when he
            had descended to write more like one, in the Cause of Virtue, had been as unfortunate as
            others of that Class;) I will grant, I say, that in his <hi rend="italic">Beggars
            Opera</hi> he had more skilfully gratify'd the Publick Taste than all the brightest
            Authors that ever writ before him; and I have sometimes thought, from the Modesty of his
            Motto, <hi rend="italic">Nos h&aelig;c novimus esse nihil,</hi>
            <ref target="n245-1" n="281">[245.1]</ref> that he gave them that Performance as a Satyr
            upon the Depravity of their Judgment (as <hi rend="italic">Ben. Johnson</hi> of old was
            said to give his <hi rend="italic">Bartholomew-Fair</hi> in Ridicule of the vulgar Taste
            which had disliked his <hi rend="italic">Sejanus</hi>
            <ref target="n245-2" n="282">[245.2]</ref> ) and that, by artfully seducing them to be
            the Champions of the Immoralities he himself detested, he should be amply reveng'd on
            their former Severity and Ignorance. This were indeed a Triumph! which even the Author
            of <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> might have envy'd, <hi rend="italic">Cato!</hi> 'tis
            true, succeeded, but reach'd not, by full forty Days, the Progress and Applauses of the
              <hi rend="italic">Beggars Opera.</hi> Will it, however, admit of a Question, which of
            the two Compositions a good Writer would rather wish to have been the Author of? Yet, on
            the other side, must we not allow that to have taken a whole Nation, High and Low, into
            a general Applause, <pb n="246" entity="DSSR_000002909_0373"/> has shown a Power in
            Poetry which, though often attempted in the same kind, none but this one Author could
            ever yet arrive at? By what Rule, then, are we to judge of our true National Taste? But
            to keep a little closer to my Point.</p>
          <p>The same Author of the next Year had, according to the Laws of the Land, transported
            his Heroe to the <hi rend="italic">West-Indies</hi> in a Second Part to the <hi
              rend="italic">Beggars Opera</hi>; <ref target="n246-1" n="283">[246.1]</ref> but so it
            happen'd, to the Surprize of the Publick, this Second Part was forbid to come upon the
            Stage! Various were the Speculations upon this act of Power: Some thought that the
            Author, others that the Town, was hardly dealt with; a third sort, who perhaps had
            envy'd him the success of his first Part, affirm'd, when it was printed, that whatever
            the Intention might be, the Fact was in his Favour, that he had been a greater Gainer by
            Subscriptions to his Copy than he could have been by a bare Theatrical Presentation.
            Whether any Part of these Opinions were true I am not concerned to determine or
            consider. But how the affected me I am going to tell you. Soon after this Prohibition,
              <ref target="n246-2" n="284">[246.2]</ref> my Performance was to come upon the Stage,
            at a time when many <pb n="247" entity="DSSR_000002909_0374"/> People were out of Humour
            at the late Disappointment, and seem'd willing to lay hold of any Pretence of making a
            Reprizal. Great Umbrage was taken that I was permitted to have the whole Town to my
            self, by this absolute Forbiddance of what they had more mind to have been entertain'd
            with. And, some few Days before my Bawble was acted, I was inform'd that a strong Party
            would be made against it: This Report I slighted, as not conceiving why it should be
            true; and when I was afterwards told what was the pretended Provocation of this Party, I
            slighted it still more, as having less Reason to suppose any Persons could believe me
            capable (had I had the Power) of giving such a Provocation. The Report, it seems, that
            had run against me was this: That, to make way for the Success of my own Play, I had
            privately found means, or made Interest, that the Second Part of the <hi rend="italic"
              >Beggars Opera</hi> might be suppressed. What an involuntary Compliment did the
            Reporters of this falshood make me? to suppose me of Consideration enough to Influence a
            great Officer of State to gratify the Spleen or Envy of a Comedian so far as to rob the
            Publick of an innocent Diversion (if it were such) that one but that cunning Comedian
            might be suffered to give it them. <ref target="n247-1" n="285">[247.1]</ref> This is so
            very gross a Supposition that it <pb n="248" entity="DSSR_000002909_0375"/> needs only
            its own senseless Face to confound it; let that alone, then, be my Defence against it.
            But against blind Malice and staring inhumanity whatever is upon the Stage has no
            Defence! There they knew I stood helpless and expos'd to whatever they might please to
            load or asperse me with. I had not considered, poor Devil! that from the Security of a
            full Pit Dunces might be Criticks, Cowards valiant, and 'Prentices Gentlemen! Whether
            any such were concern'd in the Murder of my Play I am not certain, for I never
            endeavour'd to discover any one of its Assassins; I cannot afford them a milder Name,
            from their unmanly manner of destroying it. Had it been heard, they might have left me
            nothing to say to them: 'Tis true it faintly held up its wounded Head a second Day, and
            would have spoke for Mercy, but was not suffer'd. Not even the Presence of a Royal Heir
            apparent could protect it. But then I was reduced to be serious with them; their Clamour
            then became an Insolence, which I thought it my Duty by the Sacrifice of any Interest of
            my own to put an end to. I therefore quitted the Actor for the Author, and, stepping
            forward to the Pit, told them, <hi rend="italic">That since I found they were not
              inclin'd that this Play should go forward, I gave them my Word that after this Night
              it should never be acted agen: But that, in the mean time, I hop'd they would consider
              in whose Presence they were, and for <pb n="249" entity="DSSR_000002909_0376"/> that
              Reason at least would suspend what farther Marks of their Displeasure they might
              imagine I had deserved.</hi> At this there was a dead Silence; and after some little
            Pause, a few civiliz'd Hands signify'd their Approbation. When the Play went on, I
            observ'd about a Dozen Persons of no extraordinary Appearance sullenly walk'd out of the
            Pit. After which, every Scene of it, while uninterrupted, met with more Applause than my
            best Hopes had expected. But it came too late: Peace to its !Manes! I had given my Word
            it should fall, and I kept it by giving out another Play for the next Day, though I knew
            the Boxes were all lett for the same again. Such, then, was the Treatment I met with:
            How much of it the Errors of the Play might deserve I refer to the Judgment of those who
            may have Curiosity and idle time enough to read it. <ref target="n249-1" n="286"
            >[249.1]</ref> But if I had no occasion to complain of the Reception it met with from
            its <hi rend="italic">quieted</hi> Audience, sure it can be no great Vanity to impute
            its Disgraces chiefly to that Severe Resentment which a groundless Report of me had
            inflam'd: Yet those Disgraces have left me something to boast of, an Honour preferable
            even to the Applause of my Enemies: A noble Lord came behind the Scenes, and told me,
            from the Box, where he was in waiting, <hi rend="italic">That what I said to quiet the
              Audience was extremely well taken there; and that I had been commended for it in a
              very obliging manner.</hi>
            <pb n="250" entity="DSSR_000002909_0377"/> Now, though this was the only Tumult that I
            have known to have been so effectually appeas'd these fifty Years by any thing that
            could be said to an Audience in the same Humour, I will not take any great Merit to
            myself upon it; because when, like me, you will but humbly submit to their doing you all
            the Mischief they can, they will at any time be satisfy'd.</p>
          <p>I have mention'd this particular Fact to inforce what I before observ'd, That the
            private Character of an Actor will always more or less affect his Publick Performance.
            And if I suffer'd so much from the bare <hi rend="italic">Suspicion</hi> of my having
            been guilty of a base Action, what should not an Actor expect that is hardy enough to
            think his whole private Character of no consequence? I could offer many more, tho' less
            severe Instances of the same Nature. I have seen the most tender Sentiment of Love in
            Tragedy create Laughter, instead of Compassion, when it has been applicable to the real
            Engagements of the Person that utter'd it. I have known good Parts thrown up, from an
            humble Consciousness that something in them might put an Audience in mind of&mdash;
            what was rather wish'd might be forgotten: Those remarkable Words of <hi rend="italic"
              >Evadne,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Maid's Tragedy</hi>&mdash; <hi
              rend="italic">A Maidenhead</hi>, Amintor, <hi rend="italic">at my
            Years?</hi>&mdash;have sometimes been a much stronger Jest for being a true one. But
            these are Reproaches which in all Nations the Theatre must have been us'd to, unless we
            could suppose Actors something more than Human Creatures, <pb n="251"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0378"/> void of Faults or Frailties. 'Tis a Misfortune at least
            not limited to the <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Stage. I have seen the better-bred
            Audience in <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi> made merry even with a modest Expression, when
            it has come from the Mouth of an Actress whose private Character it seem'd not to belong
            to. The Apprehension of these kind of Fleers from the Witlings of a Pit has been carry'd
            so far in our own Country, that a late valuable Actress <ref target="n251-1" n="287"
              >[251.1]</ref> (who was conscious her Beauty was not her greatest Merit) desired the
            Warmth of some Lines might be abated when they had made her too remarkably handsome: But
            in this Discretion she was alone, few others were afraid of undeserving the finest
            things that could be said to them. But to consider this Matter seriously, I cannot but
            think, at a Play, a sensible Auditor would contribute all he could to his being well
            deceiv'd, and not suffer his Imagination so far to wander from the well-acted Character
            before him, as to gratify a frivolous Spleen by Mocks or personal Sneers on the
            Performer, at the Expence of his better Entertainment. But I must now take up <hi
              rend="italic">Wilks</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi> again where I left them.</p>
          <p>Though the Contention for Superiority between <pb n="252" entity="DSSR_000002909_0379"
            /> them seem'd about this time to end in favour of the former, yet the Distress of the
            Patentee (in having his Servant his Master, as <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi> had lately
            been), was not much reliev'd by the Victory; he had only chang'd the Man, but not the
            Malady: for <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>, by being in Possession of so many good Parts,
            fell into the common Error of most Actors, that of overrating their Merit, or never
            thinking it is so thoroughly consider'd as it ought to be, which generally makes them
            proportionably troublesome to the Master, who they might consider only pays them to
            profit by them. The Patentee therefore found it as difficult to satisfy the continual
            Demands of <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> as it was dangerous to refuse them; very few
            were made that were not granted, and as few were granted as were not grudg'd him: Not
            but our good Master was as sly a Tyrant as ever was at the Head of a Theatre; for he
            gave the Actors more Liberty, and fewer Days Pay, than any of his Predecessors: He would
            laugh with them over a Bottle, and bite <ref target="n252-1" n="288">[252.1]</ref> them
            in their Bargains: He kept them poor, that they might not be able to rebel; and
            sometimes merry, that they might not think of it: All their Articles of Agreement had a
            Clause in them that he was sure to creep out at, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Their
            respective Sallaries were to be paid in such manner and proportion as others of the same
              <pb n="253" entity="DSSR_000002909_0380"/> Company were paid; which in effect made
            them all, when he pleas'd, but limited Sharers of Loss, and himself sole Proprietor of
            Profits; and this Loss or Profit they only had such verbal Accounts of as he thought
            proper to give them. 'Tis true, he would sometimes advance them Money (but not more than
            he knew at most could be due to them) upon their Bonds; upon which, whenever they were
            mutinous, he would threaten to sue them. This was the Net we danc'd in for several
            Years: But no wonder we were Dupes, while our Master was a Lawyer. This Grievance,
            however, <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> was resolv'd, for himself at least, to remedy at
            any rate; and grew daily more intractable, for every Day his Redress was delay'd. Here
            our Master found himself under a Difficulty he knew not well how to get out of: For as
            he was a close subtle Man, he seldom made use of a Confident in his Schemes of
            Government: <ref target="n253-1" n="289">[253.1]</ref> But here the old Expedient of
            Delay would stand him in no longer stead; <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> must instantly be
            comply'd with, or <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi> come again into Power! In a word, he was
            push'd so home, that he was reduc'd even to take my Opinion into his Assistance: For he
            knew I was a Rival to neither of them; perhaps, too, he had fancy'd that, from the
            Success of my first Play, I might know as much of the Stage, and what made an Actor
            valuable, as either of them: He saw, too, that tho' they had each of them five good
            Parts to my one, yet the Applause which in my few I had <pb n="254"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0381"/> met with, was given me by better Judges than as yet had
            approv'd of the best they had done. They generally measured the goodness of a Part by
            the Quantity or Length of it: I thought none bad for being short that were
            closely-natural; nor any the better for being long, without that valuable Quality. But
            in this, I doubt, as to their Interest, they judg'd better than myself; for I have
            generally observ'd that those who do a great deal not ill, have been preferr'd to those
            who do but little, though never so masterly. And therefore I allow that, while there
            were so few good Parts, and as few good Judges of them, it ought to have been no Wonder
            to me, that as an Actor I was less valued by the Master or the common People than either
            of them: All the Advantage I had of them was, that by not being troublesome I had more
            of our Master's personal Inclination than any Actor of the male Sex; <ref
              target="n254-1" n="290">[254.1]</ref> and so much of it, that I was almost the only
            one whom at that time he us'd to take into his Parties of Pleasure; very often <hi
              rend="italic">tete &agrave; tete</hi>, and sometimes in a <hi rend="italic">Partie
              quarr&egrave;e.</hi> These then were the Qualifications, however good or bad, to
            which may be imputed our Master's having made choice of me to assist him in the
            Difficulty under which he now labour'd. He <pb n="255" entity="DSSR_000002909_0382"/>
            was himself sometimes inclin'd to set up <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi> again as a Check
            upon the over-bearing Temper of <hi rend="italic">Wilks:</hi> Tho' to say truth, he
            lik'd neither of them, but was still under a Necessity that one of them should preside,
            tho' he scarce knew which of the two Evils to chuse. This Question, when I happen'd to
            be alone with him, was often debated in our Evening Conversation; nor, indeed, did I
            find it an easy matter to know which Party I ought to recommend to his Election. I knew
            they were neither of them Well-wishers to me, as in common they were Enemies to most
            Actors in proportion to the Merit that seem'd to be rising in them. But as I had the
            Prosperity of the Stage more at Heart than any other Consideration, I could not be long
            undetermined in my Opinion, and therefore gave it to our Master at once in Favour of <hi
              rend="italic">Wilks.</hi> I, with all the Force I could muster, insisted, "That if <hi
              rend="italic">Powel</hi> were "preferr'd, the ill Example of his Negligence and
            "abandon'd Character (whatever his Merit on the "Stage might be) would reduce our
            Company to "Contempt and Beggary; observing, at the same "time, in how much better Order
            our Affairs went "forward since <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> came among us, of which I
            "recounted several Instances that are not so necessary "to tire my reader with. All
            this, though he "allow'd to be true, yet <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi>, he said, was a
            better "Actor than <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> when he minded his Business "(that is to
            say, when he was, what he seldom was, "sober). But <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi>, it
            seems, had a still greater <pb n="256" entity="DSSR_000002909_0383"/> "Merit to him,
            which was, (as he observ'd) that "when Affairs were in his Hands, he had kept the
            "Actors quiet, without one Day's Pay, for six "Weeks together, and it wa snot every body
            could "do that; for you see, said he, <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> will never be "easy
            unless i give him his whole Pay, when others "have it not, and what an Injustice would
            that be "to the rest if I were to comply with him? How "do I know but then they may be

              rend="italic">Powel</hi> "at the Head of 'em?" By this Specimen of our Debate, it may
            be judg'd under how particular and merry a Government the Theatre then labour'd. To
            conclude, this Matter ended in a Resolution to sign a new Agreement with <hi
              rend="italic">Wilks</hi>, which entitled him to his full Pay of four Pounds a Week
            without any conditional Deductions. How far soever my Advice might have contributed to
            our Master's settling his Affairs upon this Foot, I never durst make the least Merit of
            it to <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>, well knowing that his great Heart would have taken
            it as a mortal Affront had I (tho' never so distantly) hinted that his Demands had
            needed any Assistance but the Justice of them. From this time, then, <hi rend="italic"
              >Wilks</hi> became first Minister, or Bustle-master-general of the Company. <ref
              target="n256-1" n="291">[256.1]</ref> He now seem'd to take new Delight in <pb n="257"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0384"/> keeping the Actors close to their Business, and got
            every Play reviv'd with Care in which he had acted the chief Part in <hi rend="italic"
              >Dublin:</hi> 'Tis true, this might be done with a particular View of setting off
            himself to Advantage; but if at the same time it served the Company, he ought not to
            want our Commendation: Now, tho' my own Conduct neither had the Appearance of his Merit,
            nor the Reward that follow'd his Industry, I cannot help observing that it shew'd me, to
            the best of my Power, a more cordial Commonwealth's Man: His first Views in serving
            himself made his Service to the whole but an incidental Merit; whereas, by my
            prosecuting the Means to make him easy in his Pay, unknown to him, or without asking any
            Favour for my self at the same time, I gave a more unquestionable Proof of my preferring
            the Publick to my Private Interest: From the same Principle I never murmur'd at whatever
            little Parts fell to my Share, and though I knew it would not recommend me to the Favour
            of the common People, I often submitted to play wicked Characters rather than they
            should be worse done by weaker Actors than my self: But perhaps, in all this Patience
            under my Situation, I supported my Spirits by a conscious Vanity: For I fancied I had
            more Reason to value myself upon being sometimes the Confident and Companion of our
            Master, than <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> had in all the more publick Favours he had
            extorted from him. I imagined, too, there was sometimes as much Skill to be shewn in a
            short Part, as in the <pb n="258" entity="DSSR_000002909_0385"/> most voluminous, which
            he generally made choice of; that even the coxcombly Follies of a Sir <hi rend="italic"
              >John Daw</hi> might as well distinguish the Capacity of an Actor, as all the dry
            Enterprizes and busy Conduct of a <hi rend="italic">Truewit.</hi>
            <ref target="n258-1" n="292">[258.1]</ref> Nor could I have any Reason to repine at the
            Superiority he enjoy'd, when I consider'd at how dear a Rate it was purchased, at the
            continual Expence of a restless Jealousy and fretful Impatience&mdash;These were the
            Passions that, in the height of his Successes, kept him lean to his last Hour, while
            what I wanted in Rank or Glory was amply made up to me in Ease and Chearfulness. But let
            not this Observation either lessen his Merit or lift up my own; since our different
            Tempers were not in our Choice, but equally natural to both of us. To be employ'd on the
            Stage was the Delight of his Life; to be justly excused from it was the Joy of mine: I
            lov'd Ease, and he Pre-eminence: In that, he might be more commendable. Tho' he often
            disturb'd me, he seldom could do it without more disordering himself. <ref
              target="n258-2" n="293">[258.2]</ref> In our Disputes, his Warmth could less bear
            Truth than I could support manifest Injuries: He would hazard our Undoing to gratify his
            Passions, tho' otherwise an honest <pb n="259" entity="DSSR_000002909_0386"/> Man; and I
            rather chose to give up my Reason, or not see my Wrong, than ruin our Community by an
            equal Rashness. By this opposite Conduct our Accounts at the End of our Labours stood
            thus: While he lived he was the elder Man, when he died he was not so old as I am: He
            never left the Stage till he left the World: I never so well enjoy'd the World as when I
            left the Stage: He died in Possession of his Wishes; and I, by having had a less
            cholerick Ambition, am still tasting mine in Health and Liberty. But as he in a great
            measure wore out the Organs of Life in his incessant Labours to gratify the Publick, the
            Many whom he gave Pleasure to will always owe his Memory a favourable
            Report&mdash;Some Facts that will vouch for the Truth of this Account will be found
            in the Sequel of these Memoirs. If I have spoke with more Freedom of his quondam
            Competitor <hi rend="italic">Powel,</hi> let my good Intentions to future Actors, in
            shewing what will so much concern them to avoid, be my Excuse for it: For though <hi
              rend="italic">Powel</hi> had from Nature much more than <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>;
            in Voice and Ear, in Elocution in Tragedy, and Humour in Comedy, greatly the Advantage
            of him; yet as I have observ'd, from the Neglect and Abuse of those valuable Gifts, he
            suffer'd <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> to be of thrice the Service to our Society. Let me
            give another Instance of the Reward and Favour which, in a Theatre, Diligence and
            Sobriety seldom fail of: <hi rend="italic">Mills</hi> the elder <ref target="n259-1"
              n="294">[259.1]</ref> grew into the Friendship of <pb n="260"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0387"/>
            <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> with not a great deal more than those useful Qualities to
            recommend him: He was an honest, quiet, careful Man, of as few Faults as Excellencies,
            and <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> rather chose him for his second in many Plays, than an
            Actor of perhaps greater Skill that was not so laboriously diligent. And from this
            constant Assiduity, <hi rend="italic">Mills,</hi> with making to himself a Friend in <hi
              rend="italic">Wilks</hi>, was advanced to a larger Sallary than any Man-Actor had
            enjoy'd during my time on the Stage. <ref target="n260-1" n="295">[260.1]</ref> I have
            yet to offer a more happy Recommendation of Temperance, which a late celebrated Actor
            was warn'd into by the mis-conduct of <hi rend="italic">Powel.</hi> About the Year that
              <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> return'd from <hi rend="italic">Dublin, Booth,</hi> who
            had commenced Actor upon that Theatre, came over to the Company in <hi rend="italic"
              >Lincolns-Inn-Fields:</hi>
            <ref target="n260-2" n="296">[260.2]</ref> He was then but an Under-graduate of the
            Buskin, and, as he told me himself, had been for some time too frank a Lover of the
            Bottle; but having had the Happiness to observe into what Contempt and Distresses <hi
              rend="italic">Powel</hi> had plung'd himself by the same Vice, he was so struck with
            the Terror of his Example, that he fix'd a Resolution (which <pb n="261"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0388"/> from that time to the End of his Days he strictly
            observ'd) of utterly reforming it; an uncommon Act of Philosophy in a young Man! of
            which in his Fame and Fortune he afterwards enjoy'd the Reward and Benefit. These
            Observations I have not merely thrown together as a Moralist, but to prove that the
            briskest loose Liver or intemperate Man (though Morality were out of the Question) can
            never arrive at the necessary Excellencies of a good or useful Actor.</p>

            <p> Cibber says nothing of his having been a member of the Lincoln's Inn Fields Company.
              But he was, for he writes in his Preface to "Woman's Wit": "during the Time of my
              writing the two first Acts I was entertain'd at the New Theatre....In the Middle of my
              Writing the Third Act, not liking my Station there, I return'd again to the Theatre
              Royal." Cibber must have joined Betterton, I should think, about the end of 1969. It
              is curious that he should in his "Apology" have entirely suppressed this incident. It
              almost suggests that there was something in it of which he was in later years somewhat

              Stage," 1749 (p. 128), says: "I remember the first night of <hi rend="italic">Love in

                <hi rend="italic">Laureat,</hi> which the Hydra-headed Multitude resolv'd to worry

              >Raftor</hi> came on in the part of <hi rend="italic">Phillida</hi>, the monstrous
              Roar subsided. A Person in the Stage-Box, next to my Post, called out to his Companion
              in the following elegant Style&mdash;'Zounds! <hi rend="italic">Tom!</hi> take
              Care! or this charming little Devil will save all.'" Chetwood's "Post" was that of
              Prompter.</p>

            <p> This second part was called "Polly." In his Preface Gay gives an account of its
              being vetoed. The prohibition undoubtedly was in revenge for the political satire in
              "The Beggar's Opera." "Polly" was published by subscription, and probably brought the
              author more in that way than its production would have done. It was played for the
              first time at the Haymarket, 19th June, 1777. It is, as Genest says, miserably
              inferior to the first part.</p>

            <p> I know only one case in which a new piece is said to have been prohibited because
              the other house was gong to play one on the same subject. This is Swiney's "Quacks;
              or, Love's the Physician," produced at Drury Lane on 18th March, 1705, after being
              twice vetoed. Swiney in his Preface gives the above as the reason for the
            prohibition.</p>

            <p> Bellchambers notes that his was probably Mrs. Oldfield. But I think this more than
              doubtful, for this lady not only was fair, but also, as Touchstone says, "had the gift
              to know it." It is, of course, impossible to say decidedly to whom Cibber referred;
              but I fancy that Mrs. Barry is the actress who best fulfils the conditions, though, of
              course, I must admit that her having been dead for a quarter of a century weakens my
              case.</p>

            <p> John Mills, in the advertisement issued by Rich, in 1709, in the course of a dispute
              with his actors, is stated to have a salary of &pound;4 a week for himself, and
              &pound;1 a week for his wife, for little or nothing." This advertisement is quoted
              by me in Chap. XII. Mills's salary was the same as Betterton's. No doubt Cibber,
              Wilks, Dogget, and Booth had ultimately larger salaries, but they, of course, were
              managers as well as actors.</p>

          <p><hi rend="italic">The Patentee of</hi> Drury-Lane <hi rend="italic">wiser than his
              Actors. His particular Menagement. The Author continues to write Plays. Why. The best
              dramatick Poets censured by</hi> J. Collier, <hi rend="italic">in his</hi> Short View
            of the Stage. <hi rend="italic">It has a good Effect. The Master of the Revels, from
              that time, cautious in his licensing new Plays. A complaint against him. His Authority
              founded upon Custom only. The late Law for fixing that Authority in a proper Person,
              considered.</hi></p>

          <p>THOUGH the Master of our Theatre had no Conception himself of Theatrical Merit either
            in Authors or Actors, yet his Judgment was govern'd by a saving Rule in both: He look'd
            into his Receipts for the Value of a Play, and from common Fame he judg'd of his Actors.
            But by whatever Rule he was govern'd, while he had prudently <pb n="263"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0390"/> reserv'd to himself a Power of not paying them more
            than their Merit could get, he could not be much deceived by their being over or
            under-valued. In a Word, he had with great Skill inverted the Constitution of the Stage,
            and quite changed the Channel of Profits arising from it; formerly, (when there was but
            one Company) the Proprietors punctually paid the Actors their appointed Sallaries, and
            took to themselves only the clear Profits: But our wiser Proprietor took first out of
            every Day's Receipts two Shillings in the Pound to himself; and left their Sallaries to
            be paid only as the less or greater Deficiencies of acting (according to his own
            Accounts) would permit. What seem'd most extraordinary in these Measures was, that at
            the same time he had persuaded us to be contented with our Condition, upon his assuring
            us that as fast as Money would come in we should all be paid our Arrears: And that we
            might not have it always in our Power to say he had never intended to keep his Word, I
            remember in a few years after this time he once paid us nine Days in one Week: This
            happen'd when the <hi rend="italic">Funeral,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Grief
              &agrave; la Mode,</hi>
            <ref target="n263-1" n="297">[263.1]</ref> was first acted, with more than expected
            Success. Whether this well-tim'd Bounty was only allow'd us to save Appearances I will
            not say: But if that was his real Motive for it, it was too costly a frolick to be
            repeated, and was at least the only Grimace of its kind he vouchsafed us; we <pb n="264"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0391"/> never having received one Day more of those Arrears in
            above fifteen Years Service.</p>
          <p>While the Actors were in this Condition, I think I may very well be excused in my
            presuming to write Plays: which I was forced to do for the Support of my encreasing
            Family, my precarious Income as an Actor being then too scanty to supply it with even
            the Necessaries of Life.</p>
          <p>It may be observable, too, that my Muse and my Spouse were equally prolifick; that the
            one was seldom the Mother of a Child, but in the same Year the other made me the Father
            of a Play: I think we had a Dozen of each Sort between us; of both which kinds, some
            died in their Infancy, and near an equal Number of each were alive when I quitted the
            Theatre&mdash;But it is not Wonder, when a Muse is only call'd upon by Family Duty,
            she should not always rejoice in the Fruit of her Labour. To this Necessity of writing,
            then, I attribute the Defects of my second Play, which, coming out too hastily the Year
            after my first, turn'd to very little Account. But having got as much by my first as I
            ought to have expected from the Success of them both, I had no great Reason to complain:
            Not but, I confess, so bad was my second, that I do not chuse to tell you the Name of
            it; and that it might be peaceably forgotten, I have not given it a Place in the two
            Volumes of those I publish'd in Quarto in the Year 1721. <ref target="n264-1" n="298"
              >[264.1]</ref> And <pb n="265" entity="DSSR_000002909_0392"/> whenever I took upon me
            to make some dormant Play of an old Author to the best of my Judgment fitter for the
            Stage, it was honestly not to be idle that set me to work; as a good Housewife will mend
            old Linnen when she has not better Employment: But when I was more warmly engag'd by a
            Subject entirely new, I only thought it a good Subject when it seem'd worthy of an abler
            Pen than my own, and might prove as useful to the Hearer as profitable to my self:
            Therefore, whatever any of my Productions might want of Skill, Learning, Wit, or Humour,
            or however unqualify'd I might be to instruct others who so ill govern'd my self: Yet
            such Plays (entirely my own) were not wanting, at least, in what our most admired
            Writers seem'd to neglect, and without which I cannot allow the most taking Play to be
            intrinsically <pb n="266" entity="DSSR_000002909_0393"/> good, or to be a Work upon
            which a Man of Sense and Probity should value himself: I mean when they do not, as well
              <hi rend="italic">prodesse</hi> as <hi rend="italic">delectare,</hi>
            <ref target="n266-1" n="299">[266.1]</ref> give Profit with Delight! The <hi
              rend="italic">Utile Dulci</hi>
            <ref target="n266-2" n="300">[266.2]</ref> was, of old, equally the Point; and has
            always been my Aim, however wide of the Mark I may have shot my Arrow. It has often
            given me Amazement that our best Authors of that time could think the Wit and Spirit of
            their Scenes could be an Excuse for making the Looseness of them publick. The many
            Instances of their Talents so abused are too glaring to need a closer Comment, and are
            sometimes too gross to be recited. If then to have avoided this Imputation, or rather to
            have had the Interest and Honour of Virtue always in view, can give Merit to a Play, I
            am contented that my Readers should think such Merit the All that mine have to boast
            of&mdash;Libertines of meer Wit and Pleasure may laugh at these grave Laws that
            would limit a lively Genius: But every sensible honest Man, conscious of their Truth and
            Use, will give these Ralliers Smile for Smile, and shew a due Contempt for their
            Merriment.</p>
          <p>But while our Authors took these extraordinary Liberties with their Wit, I remember the
            Ladies were then observ'd to be decently afraid of venturing bare-fac'd to a new Comedy
            'till they had been <pb n="267" entity="DSSR_000002909_0394"/> assur'd they might do it
            without the Risque of an Insult to their Modesty&mdash;Or, if their Curiosity were
            too strong for their Patience, they took Care, at least, to save Appearances, and rarely
            came upon the first Days of Acting but in Masks, (then daily worn and admitted in the
            Pit, the side Boxes, and Gallery <ref target="n267-1" n="301">[267.1]</ref> ) which
            Custom, however, had so many ill Consequences attending it, that it has been abolish'd
            these many Years.</p>
          <p>These Immoralities of the Stage had by an avow'd Indulgence been creeping into it ever
            since King <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi> his Time; nothing that was loose could then be
            too low for it: The <hi rend="italic">London Cuckolds,</hi> the most rank Play that ever
            succeeded, <ref target="n267-2" n="302">[267.2]</ref> was then in the highest
            Court-Favour: In this almost general Corruption, <hi rend="italic">Dryden</hi>, whose
            Plays were more fam'd for their Wit than their Chastity, led the way, which he fairly
            confesses, and endeavours to excuse in his Epilogue to the <hi rend="italic"
            >Pilgrim,</hi> revived in 1700 for his <pb n="268" entity="DSSR_000002909_0395"/>
            Benefit, <ref target="n268-1" n="303">[268.1]</ref> in his declining Age and

          <p>This Epilogue, and the Prologue to the same Play, written by <hi rend="italic"
            >Dryden,</hi> I spoke myself, which not being usually done by the same Person, I have a
            mind, while I think of it, to let you know on what Occasion they both fell to my Share,
            and how other Actors were affected by it.</p>
          <p>Sir <hi rend="italic">John Vanbrugh,</hi> who had given some light touches of his Pen
            to the <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim</hi> to assist the Benefit Day of <hi rend="italic"
              >Dryden,</hi> had the Disposal of the Parts, and I being then as an Actor in some
            Favour with him, he read the Play first with me alone, and was pleased to offer me my
            Choice of what I might like best for myself in it. But as the chief Characters were not
            (according to my Taste) the most shining, it was no great Self-denial in me that I
            desir'd he would first take care of those who were more difficult to be pleased; I
            therefore only chose for myself two short incidental Parts, that of <hi rend="italic"
              >the stuttering Cook</hi>
            <ref target="n269-1" n="305">[269.1]</ref> and <hi rend="italic">the mad
            Englishman.</hi> In which homely Characters I saw more Matter for Delight than those
            that <pb n="270" entity="DSSR_000002909_0397"/> might have a better Pretence to the
            Amiable: And when the Play came to be acted I was not deceiv'd in my Choice. Sir <hi
              rend="italic">John,</hi> upon my being contented with so little a Share in the
            Entertainment, gave me the Epilogue to make up my Mess; which being written so much
            above the Strain of common Authors, I confess I was not a little pleased with. And <hi
              rend="italic">Dryden,</hi> upon his hearing me repeat it to him, made me a farther
            Compliment of trusting me with the Prologue. This so particular Distinction was looked
            upon by the Actors as something too extraordinary. But no one was so impatiently ruffled
            at it as <hi rend="italic">Wilks,</hi> who seldom chose soft Words when he spoke of any
            thing he did not like. The most gentle thing he said of it was, that he did not
            understand such Treatment; that for his Part he look'd upon it as an Affront to all the
            rest of the Company, that there shou'd be but one out of the Whole judg'd fit to speak
            either a Prologue or an Epilogue! to quiet him I offer'd to decline either in his
            Favour, or both, if it were equally easy to the Author: But he was too much concern'd to
            accept of an Offer that had been made to another in preference to himself, and which he
            seem'd to think his best way of resenting wa to contemn. But from that time, however, he
            was resolv'd, to the best of his Power, never to let the first Offer of a Prologue
            escape him: Which little Ambition sometimes made him pay too dear for his Success: The
            Flatness of the many miserable Prologues that by this means fell to his Lot, seem'd <pb
              n="271" entity="DSSR_000002909_0398"/> wofully unequal to the few good ones he might
            have Reason to triumph in.</p>
          <p>I have given you this Fact only as a Sample of those frequent Rubs and Impediments I
            met with when any Step was made to my being distinguish'd as an Actor; and from this
            Incident, too, you may partly see what occasion'd so many Prologues, after the Death of
              <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi>, to fall into the Hands of one Speaker: But it is not
            every Successor to a vacant Post that brings into it the Talents equal to those of a
            Predecessor. To speak a good Prologue well is, in my Opinion, one of the hardest Parts
            and strongest Proofs of sound Elocution, of which, I confess, I never thought that any
            of the several who attempted it shew'd themselves, by far, equal Masters to <hi
              rend="italic">Betterton. Betterton,</hi> in the Delivery of a good Prologue, had a
            natural Gravity that gave Strength to good Sense, a temper'd Spirit that gave Life to
            Wit, and a dry Reserve in his Smile that threw Ridicule into its brightest colours. Of
            these Qualities, in the speaking of a Prologue, <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> only had
            the first, but attain'd not to the other two: <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> had Spirit,
            but gave too loose a Rein to it, and it was seldom he could speak a grave and weighty
            Verse harmoniously: His Accents were frequently too sharp and violent, which sometimes
            occasion'd his eagerly cutting off half the Sound of Syllables that ought to have been
            gently melted into the Melody of Metre: In Verses of Humour, too, he would sometimes
            carry the Mimickry farther than the hint would bear, even to <pb n="272"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0399"/> a trifling Light, as if himself were pleased to see it
            so glittering. In the Truth of this Criticism I have been confirm'd by those whose
            Judgment I dare more confidently rely on than my own: <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> had
            many Excellencies, but if we leave Prologue-Speaking out of the Number he will still
            have enough to have made him a valuable Actor. And I only make this Exception form them
            to caution others from imitating what, in his time, they might have too implicitly
            admired&mdash;But I have a Word or two more to say concerning the Immoralities of
            the Stage. Our Theatrical Writers were not only accus'd of Immorality, but Prophaneness;
            many flagrant Instances of which were collected and published by a Nonjuring Clergyman,
              <hi rend="italic">Jeremy Collier,</hi> in his <hi rend="italic">View of the
            Stage,</hi> &amp;c. about the Year 1697. <ref target="n272-1" n="306">[272.1]</ref>
            However just his Charge against the Authors that then wrote for it might be, I cannot
            but think his Sentence against the Stage itself is unequal; Reformation he thinks too
            mild a Treatment for it, and is therefore for laying his Ax to the Root of it: If this
            were to be a Rule of Judgment for Offences of the same Nature, <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0400"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0401"/>

            <pb n="273" entity="DSSR_000002909_0404"/> what might become of the Pulpit, where many a
            seditious and corrupted Teacher has been known to cover the most pernicious Doctrine
            with the Masque of Religion? This puts me in mind of what the noted <hi rend="italic"
              >Jo. Hains,</hi>
            <ref target="n273-1" n="307">[273.1]</ref> the Comedian, a Fellow of a wicked Wit, said
            upon this Occasion; who being ask'd what could transport Mr. <hi rend="italic"
            >Collier</hi> into so blind a Zeal for a general Suppression of the Stage, when only
            some particular Authors had abus'd it? Whereas the Stage, he could not but know, was
            generally allow'd, when rightly conducted, to be a delightful Method of mending our
            Morals? "For that Reason, reply'd <hi rend="italic">"Hains: Collier</hi> is by
            Profession a Moral-mender "himself, and two of Trade, you know, can never "agree." <ref
              target="n273-2" n="308">[273.2]</ref>
          </p>

          <pb n="274" entity="DSSR_000002909_0405"/>
          <p>The Authors of <hi rend="italic">the old Batchelor</hi> and of the <hi rend="italic"
              >Relapse</hi> were those whom <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi> most labour'd to convict
            of Immorality; to which they severally publish'd their Reply; the first seem'd too much
            hurt to be able to defend himself, and the other felt him so little that his Wit only
            laugh'd at his Lashes. <ref target="n274-1" n="309">[274.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>My first Play of the <hi rend="italic">Fool in Fashion</hi>, too, being then in a
            Course of Success; perhaps for that Reason only, this severe Author thought himself
            oblig'd to attack it; in which I hope he has shewn more Zeal than Justice, his greatest
            Charge against it is , that it sometimes uses the Word <hi rend="italic">Faith!</hi> as
            an Oath, in the Dialogue: But if <hi rend="italic">Faith</hi> may as well signify our
            given Word or Credit as our religious Belief, why might not his Charity have taken it in
            the less criminal Sense? Nevertheless, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi>'s Book was
            upon the whole thought so laudable a Work, that King <pb n="275"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0406"/>
            <hi rend="italic">William</hi>, soon after it was publish'd, granted him a <hi
              rend="italic">Nolo Prosequi</hi> when he stood answerable to the Law for his having
            absolved two Criminals just before they were executed for High Treason. And it must be
            farther granted that his calling our Dramatick Writers to this strict Account had a very
            wholesome Effect upon those who writ after this time. They were now a great deal more
            upon their guard; Indecencies were no longer Wit; and by Degrees the fair Sex came again
            to fill the Boxes on the first Day of a new Comedy, without Fear or Censure. But the
            Master of the Revels, <ref target="n275-1" n="310">[275.1]</ref> who then licens'd all
            Plays for the Stage, assisted this Reformation with a more zealous Severity than ever.
            He would strike out whole Scenes of a vicious or immoral Character, tho' it were visibly
            shewn to be reform'd or punish'd; a severe Instance of this kind falling upon my self
            may be an Excuse for my relating it: When <hi rend="italic">Richard the third</hi> (as I
            alter'd it from <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi>) <ref target="n275-2" n="311"
            >[275.2]</ref> came from his Hands to the Stage, he expung'd the whole first Act without
            sparing a Line of it. This extraordinary Stroke of a <hi rend="italic">Sic volo</hi>
            occasion'd my applying to him for the small Indulgence of a Speech or two, that the
            other four Acts might limp on with a little less Absurdity! no! he had not leisure to
            consider what might be separately inoffensive. He had an Objection <pb n="276"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0407"/> to the whole Act, and the Reason he gave for it was,
            that the Distresses of King <hi rend="italic">Henry the Sixth,</hi> who is kill'd by <hi
              rend="italic">Richard</hi> in the first Act, would put weak People too much in mind of
            King <hi rend="italic">James</hi> then living in <hi rend="italic">France</hi>; a
            notable Proof of his Zeal for the Government! <ref target="n276-1" n="312">[276.1]</ref>
            Those who have read either the Play or the History, I dare say will think he strain'd
            hard for the Parallel. In a Word, we were forc'd, for some few Years, to let the Play
            take its Fate with only four Acts divided into five; by the Loss of so considerable a
            Limb, may one not modestly suppose it was robbed of at least a fifth Part of that Favour
            it afterwards met with? For tho' this first Act was at last recovered, and made the Play
            whole again, yet the Relief came too late to repay me for the Pains I had taken in it.
            Nor did I ever hear that this zealous Severity of the Master of the Revels was
            afterwards thought justifiable. But my good Fortune, in Process of time, gave me an
            Opportunity to talk with my Oppressor in my Turn.</p>
          <p>The Patent granted by his Majesty King <hi rend="italic">George</hi> the First to Sir
              <hi rend="italic">Richard Steele</hi> and his Assigns, <ref target="n276-2" n="313"
              >[276.2]</ref> of which I was one, made us sole Judges of what Plays <pb n="277"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0408"/> might be proper for the Stage, without submitting them
            to the Approbation or License of any other particular Person. Notwithstanding which, the
            Master of the Revels demanded his Fee of Forty Shillings upon our acting a new One, tho'
            we had spared him the Trouble of perusing it. This occasion'd my being deputed to him to
            enquire into the Right of his Demand, and to make an amicable End of our Dispute. <ref
              target="n277-1" n="314">[277.1]</ref> I confess I did not dislike the Office; and told
            him, according to my Instructions, That I came not to defend even our own Right in
            prejudice to his; that if our Patent had inadvertently superseded the Grant of any
            former Power or Warrant whereon he might ground his Pretensions, we would not insist
            upon our Broad Seal, but would readily answer his Demands upon sight of such his
            Warrant, any thing in our Patent to the contrary notwithstanding. This I had reason to
            think he could not do; and when I found he made no direct Reply to my Question, I
            repeated it with greater Civilities <pb n="278" entity="DSSR_000002909_0409"/> and
            Offers of Compliance, 'till I was forc'd in the end to conclude with telling him, That
            as his Pretensions were not back'd with any visible Instrument of Right, and as his
            strongest Pleas was Custom, we could not so far extend our Complaisance as to continue
            his Fees upon so slender a Claim to them: And from that Time neither our Plays or his
            Fees gave either of us any farther trouble. In this Negotiation I am the bolder to think
            Justice was on our Side, because the Law lately pass'd, <ref target="n278-1" n="315"
              >[278.1]</ref> by which the <pb n="279" entity="DSSR_000002909_0410"/> Power of
            Licensing Plays, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> is given to a proper Person, is a
            strong Presumption that no Law had ever given that Power to any such Person before.</p>
          <p>My having mentioned this Law, which so immediately affected the Stage, inclines me to
            throw out a <pb n="280" entity="DSSR_000002909_0411"/> few Observations upon it: But I
            must first lead you gradually thro' the Facts and natural Causes that made such a Law
            necessary.</p>
          <p>Although it had been taken for granted, from Time <pb n="281"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0412"/> immemorial, that no Company of Comedians could act
            Plays, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> without the Royal License or Protection of
            some legal Authority, a Theatre was, notwithstanding, erected in <hi rend="italic"
              >Goodman's-Fields</hi> about <pb n="282" entity="DSSR_000002909_0413"/> seven Years
            ago, <ref target="n282-1" n="316">[282.1]</ref> where Plays, without any such License,
            were acted for some time unmolested and with Impunity. After a Year or two, this
            Playhouse was thought a Nusance too near the City: Upon which the Lord-Mayor and
            Aldermen petition'd the Crown to suppress it: What Steps were taken in favour of that
            Petition I know not, but common Fame seem'd to allow, from what had or had not been done
            in it, that acting Plays in the said Theatre was not evidently unlawful. <ref
              target="n282-2" n="317">[282.2]</ref> However, this Question of Acting without a
            License a little time after came to a nearer Decision in <hi rend="italic"
              >Westminster-Hall</hi>; the Occasion of bringing it thither was this: It happened that
            the Purchasers of the Patent, to whom <pb n="283" entity="DSSR_000002909_0414"/> Mr. <hi
              rend="italic">Booth</hi> and Myself had sold our Shares, <ref target="n283-1" n="318"
              >[283.1]</ref> were at variance with the Comedians that were then left to their
            Government, and the Variance ended in the chief of those Comedians deserting and setting
            up for themselves in the little House in the <hi rend="italic">Hay-Market,</hi> in 2733,
            by which Desertion the Patentees were very much distressed and considerable Losers.
            Their Affairs being in this desperate Condition, they were advis'd to put the Act of the
            Twelfth of Queen <hi rend="italic">Anne</hi> against Vagabonds in force against these
            Deserters, then acting in the <hi rend="italic">Hay-Market</hi> without License.
            Accordingly, one of their chief Performers <ref target="n283-2" n="319">[283.2]</ref>
            was taken from the Stage by a Justice of Peace his Warrant, and committed to <hi
              rend="italic">Bridewell</hi> as one within the Penalty of the said Act. When the
            Legality of this Commitment was disputed in <hi rend="italic">Westminster-Hall,</hi> by
            all I could observe from the learned Pleadings on both Sides (for I had the Curiosity to
              <pb n="284" entity="DSSR_000002909_0415"/> hear them) it did not appear to me that the
            Comedian so committed was within the Description of the said Act, he being a Housekeeper
            and having a Vote for the <hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi> Members of Parliament. He
            was discharged accordingly, and conducted through the Hall with the Congratulations of
            the Crowds that attended and wish'd well to his Cause.</p>
          <p>The Issue of this Trial threw me at that time into a very odd Reflexion, <hi
              rend="italic">viz.</hi> That if acting Plays without License did not make the
            Performers Vagabonds unless they wandered from their Habitations so to do, how
            particular was the Case of Us three late Menaging Actors at the <hi rend="italic"
              >Theatre-Royal,</hi> who in twenty Years before had paid upon an Averidge at least
            Twenty Thousand Pounds to be protected (as Actors) from a Law that has not since
            appeared to be against us. Now, whether we might certainly have acted without any
            License at all I shall not pretend to determine; but this I have of my own Knowledge to
            say, That in Queen <hi rend="italic">Anne</hi>'s Reign the Stage was in such Confusion,
            and its Affairs in such Distress, that Sir <hi rend="italic">John Vanbrugh</hi> and Mr.
              <hi rend="italic">Congreve,</hi> after they had held it about one Year, threw up the
            Menagement of it as an unprofitable Post, after which a License for Acting was not
            thought worth any Gentleman's asking for, and almost seem'd to go a begging, 'till some
            time after, by the Care, Application, and Industry of three Actors, it became so
            prosperous, and the Profits so considerable, that it created a new Place, and a <hi
              rend="italic">Sine-cure</hi> of a Thousand <pb n="285" entity="DSSR_000002909_0416"/>
            Pounds a Year, <ref target="n285-1" n="320">[285.1]</ref> which the Labour of those
            Actors constantly paid to such Persons as had from time to time Merit or Interest enough
            to get their Names inserted as Fourth Menagers in a License with them for acting Plays,
              <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> a Preferment that many a Sir <hi rend="italic"
              >Francis Wronghead</hi> would have jump'd at. <ref target="n285-2" n="321"
            >[285.2]</ref> But to go on with my Story. This Endeavour of the Patentees to suppress
            the Comedians acting in the <hi rend="italic">Hay-Market</hi> proving ineffectual, and
            no Hopes of a Reunion then appearing, the Remains of the Company left in <hi
              rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi> were reduced to a very low Condition. At this time a
            third Purchaser, <hi rend="italic">Charles Fleetwood,</hi> Esq., stept in; who judging
            the best Time to buy was when the Stock was at the lowest Price, struck up a Bargain at
            once for Five Parts in Six of the Patent; <ref target="n285-3" n="322">[285.3]</ref>
            and, at the same time, gave the revolted Comedians their own Terms to return and come
            under his Government in <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane,</hi> where they now continue to
            act at very ample Sallaries, as I am informed, in 1738. <ref target="n285-4" n="323"
              >[285.4]</ref> But (as I have observ'd) the late <pb n="286"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0417"/> Cause of the prosecuted Comedian having gone so
            strongly in his Favour, and the House in <hi rend="italic">Goodman's-Fields,</hi> too,
            continuing to act with as little Authority unmolested; these so tolerated Companies gave
            Encouragement to a broken Wit to collect a fourth Company, who for some time acted Plays
            in the <hi rend="italic">Hay-Market,</hi> which House the united <hi rend="italic"
              >Drury-Lane</hi> Comedians had lately quitted: This enterprising Person, I say (whom I
            do not chuse to name, <ref target="n286-1" n="324">[286.1]</ref> unless it could be to
            his Advantage, or that it were of Importance) had Sense enough to know that the best
            Plays with bad Actors would turn but to a very poor Account; and therefore found it
            necessary to give the Publick some Pieces of an extraordinary Kind, the Poetry of which
            he conceiv'd ought to be so strong that the greatest Dunce of an Actor could not spoil
            it: He knew, too, that as he was in haste to <pb n="287" entity="DSSR_000002909_0418"/>
            get Money, it would take up less time to be intrepidly abusive than decently
            entertaining; that to draw the Mob after him he must rake the Channel <ref
              target="n287-1" n="325">[287.1]</ref> and pelt their Superiors; that, to shew himself
            somebody, he must come up to <hi rend="italic">Juvenal</hi>'s Advice and stand the
            Consequence:</p>
          <lg type="verse">

          </lg>


          <p>Such, then, was the mettlesome Modesty he set out with; upon this Principle he produc'd
            several frank and free Farces that seem'd to knock all Distinctions of Mankind on the
            Head: Religion, Laws, Government, Priests, Judges, and Ministers, were all laid flat at
            the Feet of this <hi rend="italic">Herculean</hi> Satyrist! This <hi rend="italic"
              >Drawcansir</hi> in Wit, <ref target="n287-3" n="327">[287.3]</ref> that spared
            neither Friend nor Foe! who to make his Poetical Fame immortal, like another <hi
              rend="italic">Erostratus,</hi> set Fire to his Stage by writing up to an Act of
            Parliament to demolish it. <ref target="n287-4" n="328">[287.4]</ref> I shall <pb
              n="288" entity="DSSR_000002909_0419"/> not give the particular Strokes of his
            Ingenuity a Chance to be remembred by reciting them; it may be enough to say, in general
            Terms, they were so openly flagrant, that the Wisdom of the Legislature thought it high
            time to take a proper Notice of them. <ref target="n288-1" n="329">[288.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>Having now shewn by what means there came to be four Theatres, besides a fifth for
            Operas, in <hi rend="italic">London,</hi> all open at the same time, and that while they
            were so numerous it was evident some of them must have starv'd unless they fed upon the
            Trash and Filth of Buffoonery and Licentiousness; I now come, as I promis'd, to speak of
            that necessary Law which has reduced their Number and prevents the Repetition of such
            Abuses in those that remain open for the Publick Recreation.</p>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0420"/>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0421"/>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0422"/>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0423"/>

          <pb n="289" entity="DSSR_000002909_0424"/>
          <p>While this Law was in Debate a lively Spirit and uncommon Eloquence was employ'd
            against it. <ref target="n289-1" n="330">[289.1]</ref> It was urg'd That <hi
              rend="italic">one</hi> of the greatest Goods we can enjoy is <hi rend="italic"
              >Liberty.</hi> (This we may grant to be an incontestable Truth, without its being the
            least Objection to this Law.) It was said, too, That to bring the Stage under the
            Restraint of a Licenser was leading the way to an Attack upon the Liberty of the Press.
            This amounts but to a Jealousy at best, which I hope and believe all honest <hi
              rend="italic">Englishmen</hi> have as much Reason to think a groundless, as to fear it
            is a just Jealousy: For the Stage and the Press, I shall endeavour to shew, are very
            different Weapons to wound with. If a great Man could be no more injured by being
            personally ridicul'd or made contemptible in a Play, than by the same Matter only
            printed and read against him in a Pamphlet or the strongest Verse; then, indeed, the
            Stage and the Press might pretend to be upon an equal Foot of Liberty: But when the wide
            Difference between these two Liberties comes to be explain'd and consider'd, I dare say
            we shall find the Injuries from one capable of being ten times more severe and
            formidable than from the other: Let us see, at least, if the Case will not be vastly
            alter'd. Read what Mr. <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi> in his <hi rend="italic"
            >Defence</hi> of his <hi rend="italic">Short View of the Stage</hi>, c. Page 25, says to
            this Point; he sets this Difference in a clear Light. These are his Words:</p>
          <pb n="290" entity="DSSR_000002909_0425"/>
          <p>"The Satyr of a <hi rend="italic">Comedian</hi> and another <hi rend="italic"
            >Poet,</hi> have "a different effect upon Reputation. A Character "of Disadvantage upon
            the <hi rend="italic">Stage,</hi> makes a stronger "Impression than elsewhere. Reading
            is but Hearing "at the second Hand; Now Hearing at the best, "is a more languid
            Conveyance than Sight. For as <hi rend="italic">"Horace</hi> observes,</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>
              <hi rend="italic">Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
              <hi rend="italic">Quam qu&oelig; sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus.</hi>
              <ref target="n290-1" n="331">[290.1]</ref>
            </l>
          </lg>


          <p>"The Eye is much more affecting, and strikes "deeper into the Memory than the Ear.
            Besides, "Upon the <hi rend="italic">Stage</hi> both the Senses are in Conjunction. "The
            Life of the Action fortifies the Object, "and awakens the Mind to take hold of it. Thus
            "a dramatick Abuse is rivetted in the Audience, a "Jest is improv'd into an Argument,
            and Rallying "grows up into Reason: Thus a Character of Scandal "becomes almost
            indelible, a Man goes for a Blockhead "upon <hi rend="italic">Content</hi>; and he
            that's made a Fool in "a <hi rend="italic">Play</hi>, is often made one for his
            Life-time. 'Tis "true he passes for such only among the prejudiced "and unthinking; but
            these are no inconsiderable "Division of Mankind. For these Reasons, I humbly "conceive
            the <hi rend="italic">Stage</hi> stands in need of a great deal "of Discipline and
            Restraint: To give them an unlimited "Range, is in effect to make them Masters "of all
            Moral Distinctions, and to lay Honour and "Religion at their Mercy. To shew Greatness
            ridiculous, <pb n="291" entity="DSSR_000002909_0426"/> "is the way to lose the use, and
            abate the "value of the Quality. Things made little in jest, "will soon be so in
            earnest: for Laughing and "Esteem, are seldom bestow'd on the same Object."</p>
          <p>If this was Truth and Reason (as sure it was) forty Years ago, will it not carry the
            same Conviction with it to these Days, when there came to be a much stronger Call for a
            Reformation of the Stage, than when this Author wrote against it, or perhaps than was
            ever known since the <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Stage had a Being? And now let us
            ask another Question! Does not the general Opinion of Mankind suppose that the Honour
            and Reputation of a Minister is, or ought to be, as dear to him as his Life? Yet when
            the Law, in Queen <hi rend="italic">Anne</hi>'s Time, had made even an unsuccessful
            Attempt upon the Life of a Minister capital, could any Reason be found that the Fame and
            Honour of his Character should not be under equal Protection? Was the Wound that <hi
              rend="italic">Guiscard</hi> gave to the late Lord <hi rend="italic">Oxford,</hi> when
            a Minister, <ref target="n291-1" n="332">[291.1]</ref> a greater Injury than the
            Theatrical Insult which was offer'd to a later Minister, in a more valuable Part, his
            Character? Was it not as high time, then, to take this dangerous Weapon of mimical
            Insolence and Defamation out of the Hands of a mad Poet, as to wrest the Knife from the
            lifted Hand of a Murderer? And is not that Law of a milder Nature which <hi
              rend="italic">prevents</hi> a Crime, than that which <hi rend="italic">punishes</hi>
            it after it is committed? May not one think it amazing <pb n="292"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0427"/> that the Liberty of defaming lawful Power and Dignity
            should have been so eloquently contended for? or especially that this Liberty ought to
            triumph in a Theatre, where the most able, the most innocent, and most upright Person
            must himself be, while the Wound is given, defenceless? How long must a Man so injur'd
            lie bleeding before the Pain and Anguish of his Fame (if it suffers wrongfully) can be
            dispell'd? or say he had deserv'd Reproof and publick Accusation, yet the Weight and
            Greatness of his Office never can deserve it from a publick Stage, where the lowest
            Malice by sawcy Parallels and abusive Inuendoes may do every thing but name him: But
            alas! Liberty is so tender, so chaste a Virgin, that it seems not to suffer her to do
            irreparable Injuries with Impunity is a Violation of her! It cannot sure be a Principle
            of Liberty that would turn the Stage into a Court of Enquiry, that would let the partial
            Applauses of a vulgar Audience give Sentence upon the Conduct of Authority, and put
            Impeachments into the Mouth of a <hi rend="italic">Harlequin?</hi> Will not every
            impartial Man think that Malice, Envy, Faction, and Mis-rule, might have too much
            Advantage over lawful Power, if the Range of such a Stage-Liberty were unlimited and
            insisted on to be enroll'd among the glorious Rights of an <hi rend="italic"
            >English</hi> Subject?</p>
          <p>I remember much such another ancient Liberty, which many of the good People of <hi
              rend="italic">England</hi> were once extremely fond of; I mean that of throwing <pb
              n="293" entity="DSSR_000002909_0428"/> Squibs and Crackers at all Spectators without
            Distinction upon a Lord-Mayor's Day; but about forty Years ago a certain Nobleman
            happening to have one of his Eyes burnt out by this mischievous Merriment, it occasion'd
            a penal Law to prevent those Sorts of Jests from being laugh'd at for the future: Yet I
            have never heard that the most zealous Patriot ever thought such a Law was the least
            Restraint upon our Liberty.</p>
          <p>If I am ask'd why I am so voluntary a Champion for the Honour of this Law that has
            limited the Number of Play-Houses, and which now can no longer concern me as a Professor
            of the Stage? I reply, that it being a Law so nearly relating to the Theatre, it seems
            not at all foreign to my History to have taken notice of it; and as I have farther
            promised to give the Publick a true Portrait of my Mind, I ought fairly to let them see
            how far I am, or am not, a Blockhead, when I pretend to talk of serious Matters that may
            be judg'd so far above my Capacity: Nor will it in the least discompose me whether my
            Observations are contemn'd or applauded. A Blockhead is not always an unhappy Fellow,
            and if the World will not flatter us, we can flatter ourselves; perhaps, too, it will be
            as difficult to convince us we are in the wrong, as that you wiser Gentlemen are one
            Tittle the better for your Knowledge. It is yet a Question with me whether we weak Heads
            have not as much Pleasure, too, in giving our shallow Reason a little Exercise, as those
            clearer Brains have <pb n="294" entity="DSSR_000002909_0429"/> that are allow'd to dive
            into the deepest Doubts and Mysteries; to reflect or form a Judgment upon remarkable
            things <hi rend="italic">past</hi> is as delightful to me as it is to the gravest
            Politician to penetrate into what is <hi rend="italic">present,</hi> or to enter into
            Speculations upon what is, or is not likely to come. Why are Histories written, if all
            Men are not to judge of them? Therefore, if my Reader has no more to do that I have, I
            have a Chance for his being as willing to have a little more upon the same Subject as I
            am to give it him.</p>
          <p>When direct Arguments against this Bill were found too weak, Recourse was had to
            dissuasive ones: It was said that <hi rend="italic">this Restraint upon the Stage would
              not remedy the Evil complain'd of: That a Play refus'd to be licensed would still be
              printed, with double Advantage, when it should be insinuated that it was refused for
              some Strokes of Wit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">and would be more likely then
              to have its Effect among the People.</hi> However natural this Consequence may seem, I
            doubt it will be very difficult to give a <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> Satyr or Libel
            half the Force or Credit of an <hi rend="italic">acted</hi> one. The most artful or
            notorious Lye or strain'd Allusion that ever slander'd a great Man, may be read by some
            People with a Smile of Contempt, or, at worst, it can impose but on one Person at once:
            but when the Words of the same plausible Stuff shall be repeated on a Theatre, the Wit
            of it among a Crowd of Hearers is liable to be over-valued, and may unite and warm a
            whole Body of the Malicious or Ignorant into a Plaudit; nay, the partial Claps of only
              <hi rend="italic">twenty</hi>
            <pb n="295" entity="DSSR_000002909_0430"/> ill-minded Persons among several hundreds of
            silent Hearers shall, and often have been, mistaken for a general Approbation, and
            frequently draw into their Party the Indifferent or Inapprehensive, who rather than be
            thought not to understand the Conceit, will laugh with the Laughers and join in the
            Triumph! But alas! the <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> Reader of the same ingenious Matter
            can only like for <hi rend="italic">himself</hi>; and the Poison has a much slower
            Operation upon the Body of a People when it is so retail'd out, than when sold to a full
            Audience by wholesale. The <hi rend="italic">single</hi> Reader, too, may happen to be a
            sensible or unprejudiced Person; and then the merry Dose, meeting with the Antidote of a
            sound Judgment, perhaps may have no Operation at all: With such a one the Wit of the
            most ingenious Satyr will only by its intrinsick Truth or Value gain upon his
            Approbation; or if it be worth an Answer, a printed Falshood may possibly be confounded
            by printed Proofs against it. But against Contempt and Scandal, heighten'd and colour'd
            by the Skill of an <hi rend="italic">Actor</hi> ludicrously infusing it into a
            Multitude, there is no immediate Defence to be made or equal Reparation to be had for
            it; for it would be but a poor Satisfaction at last, after lying long patient under the
            Injury, that Time only is to shew (which would probably be the Case) that the Author of
            it was a desperate Indigent that did it for Bread. How much less dangerous or offensive,
            then, is the <hi rend="italic">written</hi> than the <hi rend="italic">acted</hi>
            Scandal? The Impression the Comedian gives to it is a kind of double <pb n="296"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0431"/> Stamp upon the Poet's Paper, that raises it to ten
            times the intrinsick Value. Might we not strengthen this Argument, too, even by the
            Eloquence that seem'd to have opposed this Law? I will say for my self, at least, that
            when I came to read the printed Arguments against it, I could scarce believe they were
            the same that had amaz'd and raised such Admiration in me when they had the Advantage of
            a lively Elocution, and of that Grace and Spirit which gave Strength and Lustre to them
            in the Delivery!</p>
          <p>Upon the whole; if the Stage ought ever to have been reform'd; if to place a Power <hi
              rend="italic">somewhere</hi> of restraining its Immoralities was not inconsistent with
            the Liberties of a civiliz'd People (neither of which, sure, any moral Man of Sense can
            dispute) might it not have shewn a Spirit too poorly prejudiced, to have rejected so
            rational a Law only because the Honour and Office of a Minister might happen, in some
            small Measure, to be protected by it. <ref target="n296-1" n="333">[296.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>But however little Weight there may be in the Observations I have made upon it, I
            shall, for my own Part, always think them just; unless I should live to see (which I do
            not expect) some future Set of upright Ministers use their utmost Endeavours to repeal
            it.</p>
          <pb n="297" entity="DSSR_000002909_0432"/>
          <p>And now we have seen the Consequence of what many People are apt to contend for,
            Variety of Play-houses! How was it possible so many could honestly subsist on what was
            fit to be seen? Their extraordinary Number, of Course, reduc'd them to live upon the
            Gratification of such Hearers as they knew would be best pleased with publick Offence;
            and publick Offence, of what kind soever, will always be a good Reason for making Laws
            to restrain it.</p>
          <p>To conclude, let us now consider this Law in a quite different Light; let us leave the

            Spectators of Plays or the Masters of Play-houses have gain'd by its having never been
            made? How could the same Stock of Plays supply four Theatres, which (without such
            additional Entertainments as a Nation of common Sense ought to be ashamed of) could not
            well support two? Satiety must have been the natural Consequence of the same Plays being
            twice as often repeated as now they need be; and Satiety puts an End to all Tastes that
            the Mind of Man can delight in. Had therefore this Law been made seven Years ago, I

            <p> Pepys (12th June, 1663) records that the Lady Mary Cromwell at the Theatre, "when
              the House began to fill, put on her vizard, and so kept it on all the play; which of
              late is become a great fashion among the ladies, which hides their whole face." Very
              soon, however, ladies gave up the use of the mask, and "Vizard-mask" became a synonym
              for "Prostitute." In this sense it is frequently used in Dryden's Prologues and
              Epilogues.</p>

            <p> To "The Pilgrim," revived in 1700, as Cibber states, Dryden's "Secular Masque" was
              attached. Whether the revival took place before or after Dryden's death (1st May,
              1700) is a moot point. See Genest, ii. 179, for an admirable account of the matter. He
              thinks it probable that the date of production was 25th March, 1700. Cibber is
              scarcely accurate in stating that "The Pilgrim" was revived for Dryden's benefit. It
              seems, rather, that Vanbrugh, who revised the play, stipulated that, in consideration
              of Dryden's writing "The Secular Masque," and also the Prologue and Epilogue, he
              should have the usual author's third night. The B. M. copy of "The Pilgrim" is dated,
              in an old handwriting, "Monday, the 5 of May."</p>

            <p> The facetious Joe Haines was an actor of great popularity, and seems to have
              excelled in the delivery of Prologues and Epilogues, especially of those written by
              himself. He was on the stage from about 1672 to 1700 or 1701, in which latter year (
              on the 4th of April) he died. He was the original Sparkish in Wycherley's "Country

              Farquhar's "Constant Couple." Davies ("Dram. Misc.," iii. 284) tells, on Quin's
              authority, an anecdote of Haines's pretended conversion to Romanism during James the
              Second's reign. He declared that the Virgin Mary appeared to him in a vision. "Lord
              Sunderland sent for Joe, and asked him about the truth of his conversion, and whether
              he had really seen the Virgin?&mdash;Yes, my Lord, I assure you it is a
              fact.&mdash;How was it, pray?&mdash;Why, as I was lying in my bed, the Virgin
              appeared to me, and said, <hi rend="italic">Arise, Joe!</hi>&mdash;You lie, you

              of the Revels. It is amusing to hear, how this flippant negotiator explained his own
              pretensions, and attempted to invalidate the right of his opponent; as if a subsequent
              charter, under the great seal, could supersede a preceding grant under the same
              authority. Charles Killigrew, who was now sixty-five years of age, seems to have been
              oppressed by the insolent civility of Colley Cibber." But this is an undeserved hit at
              Cibber, who had suffered the grossest injustice at Killigrew's hands regarding the
              licensing of "Richard III." See <hi rend="italic">ante,</hi> p. 275. The dispute

            <p> The Licensing Act of 1737. This Act was passed by Sir Robert Walpole's government,
              and gave to the Lord Chamberlain the power to prohibit a piece from being acted at
              all, by making it necessary to have every play licensed. This power, however, had
              practically been exercised by the Chamberlain before, as in the case of Gay's "Polly,"
              which Cibber has already mentioned. The immediate cause of this Act of 1737 was a
              piece called "The Golden Rump," which was so full of scurrility against the powers
              that were, that Giffard, the manager to whom it was submitted, carried it to Walpole.
              In spite of the opposition of Lord Chesterfield, who delivered a famous speech against
              it, the Bill was passed, 21st June, 1737. The "Biographia Dramatica" hints plainly
              that "The Golden Rump" was written at Walpole's instigation to afford an excuse for
              the Act. Bellchambers has the following note on this passage:&mdash;</p>
            <p>"The Abb&eacute; Le Blanc, <ref target="n278-2" n="335">[278.a]</ref> who was in
              England at the time this law passed, has the following remarks upon it in his
              correspondence:&mdash;</p>
            <p>"'This act occasioned an universal murmur in the nation, and was openly complained of
              in the public papers: in all the coffee-houses of London it was treated as an unjust
              law, and manifestly contrary to the liberties of the people of England. When winter
              came, and the play-houses were opened, that of Covent-garden began with three new
              pieces which had been approved of by the Lord Chamberlain. There was a crowd of
              spectators present at the first, and among the number myself. The best play in the
              world would not have succeeded the first night.<ref target="n278-3" n="336"
              >[278.b]</ref> There was a resolution to damn whatever might appear, the word <hi
                rend="italic">hiss</hi> not being sufficiently expressive for the English. They
              always say, to <hi rend="italic">damn</hi> a piece, to <hi rend="italic">damn</hi> an
              author, &amp;c. and, in reality, the word is not too strong to express the manner
              in which they receive a play which does not please them. The farce in question was
              damned indeed, without the least compassion: nor was that all, for the actors were
              driven off the stage, and happy was it for the author that he did not fall into the
              hands of this furious assembly.</p>
            <p>"'As you are unacquainted with the customs of this country, you cannot easily devise
              who were the authors of all this disturbance. Perhaps you may think they were
              schoolboys, apprentices, clerks, or mechanics. No, sir, they were men of a very grave
              and genteel profession; they were lawyers, and please you; a body of gentlemen,
              perhaps less honoured, but certainly more feared here than they are in France. Most of
              them live in colleges,<ref target="n278-4" n="337">[278.c]</ref> where, conversing
              always with one another, they mutually preserve a spirit of independency through the
              body, and with great ease form cabals. These gentlemen, in the stage entertainments of
              London, behave much like our footboys, in those at a fair. With us, your
              party-coloured gentry are the most noisy; but here, men of the law have all the sway,
              if I may be permitted to call so those pretended professors of it, who are rather the
              organs of chicanery, than the interpreters of justice. At Paris the cabals of the pit
              are only among young fellows, whose years may excuse their folly, or persons of the
              meanest education and stamp; here they are the fruit of deliberations in a very grave
              body of people, who are not less formidable to the minister in place, than to the
              theatrical writers. </p>
            <p>"'The players were not dismayed, but soon after stuck up bills for another new piece:
              there was the same crowding at Covent-garden, to which I again contributed. I was
              sure, at least, that if the piece advertised was not performed, I should have the
              pleasure of beholding some very extraordinary scene acted in the pit.</p>
            <p>"'Half an hour before the play was to begin, the spectators gave notice of their
              dispositions by frightful hisses and outcries, equal, perhaps, to what were ever heard
              at a Roman amphitheatre. I could not have known, but by my eyes only, that I was among
              an assembly of beings who thought themselves to be reasonable. The author, who had
              foreseen this fury of the pit, took care to be armed against it. He knew what people
              he had to deal with, and, to make them easy, put in his prologue double the usual dose
              of incense that is offered to their vanity; for there is an established tax of this
              kind, from which no author is suffered to dispense himself. This author's wise
              precaution succeeded, and the men that were before so redoubtable grew calm; the
              charms of flattery, more strong than those of music, deprived them of all their
              fierceness.</p>
            <p>"'You see, sir, that the pit is the same in all countries: it loves to be flattered,
              under the more genteel name of being complimented. If a man has tolerable address at
              panegyric, they swallow it greedily, and are easily quelled and intoxicated by the
              draught. Every one in particular thinks he merits the praise that is given to the
              whole in general; the illusion operates, and the prologue is good, only because it is
              artfully directed. Every one saves his own blush by the authority of the multitude he
              makes a part of, which is, perhaps, the only circumstance in which a man can think
              himself not obliged to be modest.</p>
            <p>"'The author having, by flattery, begun to tame this wild audience, proceeded
              entirely to reconcile it by the first scene of his performance. Two actors came in,
              one dressed in the English manner very decently, and the other with black eyebrows, a
              ribbon of an ell long under his chin, a bag-peruke immoderately powdered, and his nose
              all bedaubed with snuff. What Englishman could not know a Frenchman by this ridiculous
              picture! The common people of London think we are indeed such sort of folks, and of
              their own accord, add to our real follies all that their authors are pleased to give
              us. But when it was found, that the man thus equipped, being also laced down every
              seam of his coat, was nothing but a cook, the spectators were equally charmed and
              surprised. The author had taken care to make him speak all the impertinencies he could
              devise, and for that reason, all the impertinencies of his farce were excused, and the
              merit of it immediately decided. There was a long criticism upon our manners, our
              customs, and above all, upon our cookery. The excellence and virtues of English beef
              were cried up, and the author maintained, that it was owing to the qualities of its
              juice, that the English were so courageous, and had such a solidity of understanding,
              which raised them above all the nations in Europe: he preferred the noble old English
              pudding beyond all the finest ragouts that were ever invented by the greatest geniuses
              that France has produced; and all these ingenious strokes were loudly clapped by the
              audience.</p>
            <p>"'The pit, biassed by the abuse that was thrown on the French, forgot that they came
              to damn the play, and maintain the ancient liberty of the stage. They were friends
              with the players, and even with the court itself, and contented themselves with the
              privilege left them, of lashing our nation as much as they pleased, in the room of
              laughing at the expense of the minister. The license of authors did not seem to be too
              much restrained, since the court did not hinder them from saying all the ill they
              could of the French.</p>
            <p>"'Intractable as the populace appear in this country, those who know how to take hold
              of their foibles, may easily carry their point. Thus in the liberty of the stage
              reduced to just bounds, and yet the English pit makes no farther attempt to oppose the
              new regulation. The law is executed without the least trouble, all the plays since
              having been quietly heard, and either succeeded, or not, according to their merit.'"</p>

            <p> The theatre in Goodman's Fields was opened in October, 1729, by Thomas Odell, who
              was afterwards Deputy Licenser under the 1737 Act. Odell, having no theatrical
              experience, entrusted the management to Henry Giffard. Odell's theatre seems to have

            <p> I can find no hint that plays were ever stopped at Odell's theatre. There is a

              Honourable Sir Richard Brocas, Lord Mayor of London. By a Citizen," which demands the
              closing of the theatre, but I do not suppose any practical result followed. In 1733 an
              attempt by the Patentees of Drury Lane and Covent Garden to silence Giffard's Company,
              then playing at his new theatre in Goodman's Fields, was unsuccessful. This theatre

            <p> This "broken Wit" was Henry Fielding, between whom and Cibber there was war to the
              knife, Fielding taking every opportunity of mocking at Colley and attacking his works.</p>
            <p>Mr. Austin Dobson, in his "Fielding," page 66, writes: "When the <hi rend="italic"

                <hi rend="italic">Apology.</hi> To the attacks made upon him by Fielding at
              different times he had hitherto printed no reply&mdash;perhaps he had no
              opportunity of doing so. But in his eighth chapter, when speaking of the causes which
              led to the Licensing Act, he takes occasion to refer to his assailant in terms which
              Fielding must have found exceedingly galling. He carefully abstained from mentioning
              his name, on the ground that it could do him no good, and was of no importance; but he
              described him as 'a broken Wit,'" c.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dobson, on page 69, gives his approval to the theory that "Fielding had openly
              expressed resentment at being described by Cibber as 'a broken wit,' without being
              mentioned by name."</p>

              to quote from "Pasquin"&mdash;"the good Parent seems to imagine that he hath

            <ref target="n302-2" n="343">[302.2]</ref> who <pb n="303" entity="DSSR_000002909_0438"
            /> was kill'd at the Bar of the <hi rend="italic">Rose-Tavern,</hi>
            <ref target="n303-1" n="344">[303.1]</ref> in a frivolous, rash, accidental Quarrel; for
            which a late Resident at <hi rend="italic">Venice,</hi> Colonel <hi rend="italic"
              >Burgess,</hi> and several other Persons of Distinction, took their Tryals, and were
            acquitted. This young Man had almost every natural Gift that could promise an excellent
            Actor; he had besides a good deal of Table-wit and Humour, with a handsome Person, and
            was every Day rising <pb n="304" entity="DSSR_000002909_0439"/> into publick Favour.
            Before he was bury'd, it was observable that two or three Days together several of the
            Fair Sex, well dress'd, came in Masks (then frequently worn) and some in their own
            Coaches, to visit this Theatrical Heroe in his Shrowd. He was the elder Son of Dr. <hi
              rend="italic">Horden,</hi> Minister of <hi rend="italic">Twickenham,</hi> in <hi
              rend="italic">Middlesex.</hi> But this Misfortune was soon repair'd by the Return of
              <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> from <hi rend="italic">Dublin</hi> (who upon this young
            Man's Death was sent for over) and liv'd long enough among us to enjoy that Approbation
            from which the other was so unhappily cut off. The Winter following, <ref
              target="n304-1" n="345">[304.1]</ref>
            <hi rend="italic">Estcourt</hi>, the famous Mimick, of whom I have already spoken, had
            the same Invitation from <hi rend="italic">Ireland</hi>, where he had commenc'd Actor:
            His first Part here, at the <hi rend="italic">Theatre-Royal,</hi> was the <hi
              rend="italic">Spanish Friar,</hi> in which, tho' he had remembred every Look and
            Motion of the late <hi rend="italic">Tony Leigh</hi> so far as to put the Spectator very
              <pb n="305" entity="DSSR_000002909_0440"/> much in mind of him, yet it was visible
            through the whole, notwithstanding his Exactness in the Outlines, the true Spirit that
            was to fill up the Figure was not the same, but unskilfully dawb'd on, like a Child's
            Painting upon the Face of a <hi rend="italic">Metzo-tinto:</hi> It was too plain to the
            judicious that the Conception was not his own, but imprinted in his Memory by another of
            whom he only presented a dead Likeness. <ref target="n305-1" n="346">[305.1]</ref> But
            these were Defects not so obvious to common Spectators; no wonder, therefore, if by his
            being much sought after in private Companies, he met with a sort of Indulgence, not to
            say Partiality, for what he sometimes did upon the Stage.</p>
          <p>In the Year 1699, Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi> was first taken into the House,
            where she remain'd about a Twelve-month almost a Mute <ref target="n305-2" n="347"
              >[305.2]</ref> and unheeded, 'till Sir <hi rend="italic">John Vanbrugh,</hi> who first
            recommended her, gave her the Part of <hi rend="italic">Alinda</hi> in the <hi
              rend="italic">Pilgrim</hi> revis'd. This gentle Character happily became that want of
            Confidence which is inseparable from young Beginners, who, without it, seldom arrive to
            any Excellence: Notwithstanding, I own I was then so far deceiv'd in my Opinion of her,
            that I thought she had little more than her Person that appear'd necessary to the
            forming a good Actress; for she set out with so extraordinary a Diffidence, that it kept
            her too despondingly <pb n="306" entity="DSSR_000002909_0441"/> down to a formal, plain
            (not to say) flat manner of speaking. Nor could the silver Tone of her Voice 'till after
            some time incline my Ear to any Hope in her favour. But Publick Approbation is the warm
            Weather of a Theatrical Plant, which will soon bring it forward to whatever Perfection
            Nature has design'd it. However, Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi> (perhaps for want
            of fresh Parts) seem'd to come but slowly forward 'till the Year 1703. <ref
              target="n306-1" n="348">[306.1]</ref> Our Company that Summer acted at the <hi
              rend="italic">Bath</hi> during the Residence of Queen <hi rend="italic">Anne</hi> at
            that Place. At that time it happen'd that Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Verbruggen,</hi> by
            reason of her last Sickness (of which she some few Months after dy'd) was left in <hi
              rend="italic">London</hi>; and though most of her Parts were, of course, to be
            dispos'd of, yet so earnest was the Female Scramble for them, that only one of them fell
            to the Share of Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi>, that of <hi rend="italic"
            >Leonora</hi> in Sir <hi rend="italic">Courtly Nice</hi>; a Character of good plain
            Sense, but not over elegantly written. It was in this Part Mrs. <hi rend="italic"
              >Oldfield</hi> surpris'd me into an Opinion of her having all the innate Powers of a
            good Actress, though they were yet but in the Bloom of what they promis'd. Before she
            had acted this Part I had so cold an Expectation from her Abilities, that she could
            scarce prevail with me to rehearse with her the Scenes she was chiefly concern'd in with
            Sir <hi rend="italic">Courtly</hi>, which I then acted. However, we ran them over with a
            mutual <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0442"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0443"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0444"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002909_0445"/>
            <pb n="307" entity="DSSR_000002909_0446"/> Inadvertency of one another. I seem'd
            careless, as concluding that any Assistance I could give her would be to little or no
            purpose; and she mutter'd out her Words in a sort of mifty <ref target="n307-1" n="349"
              >[307.1]</ref> manner at my low Opinion of her. But when the Play came to be acted,
            she had a just Occasion to triumph over the Error of my Judgment, by the (almost)
            Amazement that her unexpected Performance awak'd me to; so forward and sudden a Step
            into Nature I had never seen; and what made her Performance more valuable was, that I
            knew it all proceeded from her own Understanding, untaught and unassisted by any one
            more experienc'd Actor. <ref target="n307-2" n="350">[307.2]</ref> Perhaps it may not be
            unacceptable, if I enlarge a little more upon the Theatrical Character of so memorable
            an Actress. <ref target="n307-3" n="351">[307.3]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>Though this Part of <hi rend="italic">Leonora</hi> in itself was of so little value,
            that when she got more into Esteem it was one <pb n="308" entity="DSSR_000002909_0447"/>
            of the several she gave away to inferior Actresses; yet it was the first (as I have
            observ'd) that corrected my Judgment of her, and confirm'd me in a strong Belief that
            she could not fail in very little time of being what she was afterwards allow'd to be,
            the foremost Ornament of our Theatre. Upon this unexpected Sally, then, of the Power and
            Disposition of so unforeseen an Actress, it was that I again took up the two first Acts
            of the <hi rend="italic">Careless Husband,</hi> which I had written the Summer before,
            and had thrown aside in despair of having Justice done to the Character of Lady <hi
              rend="italic">Betty Modish</hi> by any one Woman then among us; Mrs. <hi rend="italic"
              >Verbruggen</hi> being now in a very declining state of Health, and Mrs. <hi
              rend="italic">Bracegirdle</hi> out of my Reach and engag'd in another Company: But, as
            I have said, Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi> having thrown out such new Proffers of
            a Genius, I was no longer at a loss for Support; my Doubts were dispell'd, and I had now
            a new Call to finish it: Accordingly, the <hi rend="italic">Careless Husband</hi>
            <ref target="n308-1" n="352">[308.1]</ref> took its Fate <pb n="309"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0448"/> upon the Stage the Winter following, in 1704. Whatever
            favourable Reception this Comedy has met with from the Publick, it would be unjust in me
            not to place a large Share of it to the Account of Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi>;
            not only from the uncommon Excellence of her Action, but even from her personal manner
            of Conversing. There are many Sentiments in the Character of Lady <hi rend="italic"
              >Betty Modish</hi> that I may almost say were originally her own, or only dress'd with
            a little more care than when they negligently feel from her lively Humour: Had her Birth
            plac'd her in a higher Rank of Life, she had certainly appear'd in reality what in this
            Play she only excellently acted, an agreeably gay Woman of Quality a little too
            conscious of her natural Attractions. I have often seen her in private Societies, where
            Women of the best Rank might have borrow'd some part of her Behaviour without the least
            Diminution of their Sense or Dignity. And this very Morning, where I am now writing at
            the <hi rend="italic">Bath, November</hi> 11, 1738, the same Words were said of her by a
            Lady of Condition, whose better Judgment of her Personal Merit in that Light has
            embolden'd me to repeat them. After her Success in this Character of higher Life, all
            that Nature had given her of the Actress seem'd to have risen to its full Perfection:
            But the Variety of her Power could not be known 'till she was seen in variety of
            Characters; which, as fast as they fell to her, she equally excell'd in. Authors had
            much more from her Performance than they had reason to hope <pb n="310"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0449"/> for from what they had written for her; and none had
            less than another, but as their Genius in the Parts they allotted her was more or less
            elevated.</p>
          <p>In the Wearing of her Person she was particularly fortunate; her Figure was always
            improving to her Thirty-sixth Year; but her Excellence in acting was never at a stand:
            And the last new Character she shone in (<hi rend="italic">Lady Townly</hi>) was a Proof
            that she was still able to do more, if more could have been done for <hi rend="italic"
              >her.</hi>
            <ref target="n310-1" n="353">[310.1]</ref> She had one Mark of good Sense, rarely known
            in any Actor of either Sex but herself. I have observ'd several, with promising
            Dispositions, very desirous of Instruction at their first setting out; but no sooner had
            they found their least Account in it, than they were as desirous of being left to their
            own Capacity, which they then thought would be disgrac'd by their seeming to want any
            farther Assistance. But this was not Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi>'s way of
            thinking; for, to the last Year of her Life, she never undertook any Part she lik'd
            without being importunately desirous of having all the Helps in it that another could
            possibly give her. By knowing so much herself, she found how much more there was of
            Nature yet needful to be known. Yet it was a hard matter to give her any Hint that she
            was not able to take or improve. <pb n="311" entity="DSSR_000002909_0450"/> With all
            this Merit she was tractable and less presuming in her Station than several that had not
            half her Pretensions to be troublesome: But she lost nothing by her easy Conduct; she
            had every thing she ask'd, which she took care should be always reasonable, because she
            hated as much to be <hi rend="italic">grudg'd</hi> as <hi rend="italic">deny'd</hi> a
            Civility. Upon her extraordinary Action in the <hi rend="italic">Provok'd Husband</hi>
            <ref target="n311-1" n="354">[311.1]</ref> the Menagers made her a Present of Fifty
            Guineas more than her Agreement, which never was more than a Verbal one; for they knew
            she was above deserting them to engage upon any other Stage, and she was conscious they
            would never think it their Interest to give her cause of Complaint. In the last two
            Months of he Illness, when she was no longer able to assist them, she <pb n="312"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0451"/> declin'd receiving her Sallary, tho' by her Agreement
            she was entitled to it. Upon the whole she was, to the last Scene she acted, the Delight
            of her Spectators: Why then may we not close her Character with the same Indulgence with
            which <hi rend="italic">Horace</hi> speaks of a commendable Poem:</p>
          <lg type="verse">

          <p>With the Acquisition, then, of so advanc'd a Comedian as Mrs. <hi rend="italic"
              >Oldfield</hi>, and the Addition of one so much in Favour as <hi rend="italic"
            >Wilks,</hi> and by the visible Improvement of our other Actors, as <hi rend="italic"
              >Penkethman, Johnson, Bullock,</hi> and I think I may venture to name myself in the
            Number (but in what Rank I leave to the Judgment of those who have been my Spectators)
              <pb n="314" entity="DSSR_000002909_0453"/> the Reputation of our Company began to get
            ground; Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi> and Mr. <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>, by
            their frequently playing against one another in our best Comedies, very happily
            supported that Humour and Vivacity which is so peculiar to our <hi rend="italic"
            >English</hi> Stage. The <hi rend="italic">French</hi>, our only modern Competitors,
            seldom give us their Lovers in such various Lights: In their Comedies (however lively a
            People they are by nature) their Lovers are generally constant, simple Sighers, both of
            a Mind, and equally distress'd about the Difficulties of their coming together; which
            naturally makes their Conversation so serious that they are seldom good Company to their
            Auditors: And tho' I allow them many other Beauties of which we are too negligent, yet
            our Variety of Humour has Excellencies that all their valuable Observance of Rules have
            never yet attain'd to. By these Advantages, then, we began to have an equal Share of the
            politer sort of Spectators, who, for several Years, could not allow our Company to stand
            in any comparison with the other. But Theatrical Favour, like Publick Commerce, will
            sometimes deceive the best Judgments by an unaccountable change of its Channel; the best
            Commodities are not always known to meet with the best Markets. To this Decline of the
            Old Company many Accidents might contribute; as the too distant Situation of their
            Theatre, or their want of a better, for it wa snot then in the condition it now is, but
            small, and poorly fitted up within the Walls of a Tennis <hi rend="italic">Quaree</hi>
            Court, which is of the <pb n="315" entity="DSSR_000002909_0454"/> lesser sort. <ref
              target="n315-1" n="358">[315.1]</ref>
            <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi>, who was then a young Actor among them, has often told me
            of the Difficulties <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi> then labour'd under and complain'd
            of: How impracticable he found it to keep their Body to that common Order which was
            necessary for their Support; <ref target="n315-2" n="359">[315.2]</ref> of their relying
            too much upon their intrinsick Merit; and though but few of them were young even when
            they first became their own Masters, yet they were all now ten Years older, and
            consequently more liable to fall into an inactive Negligence, or were only separately
            diligent for themselves in the sole Regard of their Benefit-Plays; which several of
            their Principals knew, at worst, would raise them Contributions that would more than
            tolerably subsist them for the current Year. But as these were too precarious Expedients
            to be always depended upon, and brought in nothing to the general Support of <pb n="316"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0455"/> the Numbers who were at Sallaries under them, they were
            reduc'd to have recourse to foreign Novelties; <hi rend="italic">L'Abbe&egrave;,
              Balon,</hi> and Mademoiselle <hi rend="italic">Subligny,</hi>
            <ref target="n316-1" n="360">[316.1]</ref> three of the then most famous Dancers of the
              <hi rend="italic">French</hi> Opera, were, at several times, brought over at
            extraordinary Rates, to revive that sickly Appetite which plain Sense and Nature had
            satiated. <ref target="n316-2" n="361">[316.2]</ref> But alas! there was no recovering
            to a sound Constitution by those mere costly Cordials; the Novelty of a Dance was but of
            a short Duration, and perhaps hurtful in its consequence; for it made a Play without a
            Dance less endur'd than it had been before, when such Dancing was not to be had. But
            perhaps their exhibiting <pb n="317" entity="DSSR_000002909_0456"/> these Novelties
            might be owing to the Success we had met with in our more barbarous introducing of <hi
              rend="italic">French</hi> Mimicks and Tumblers the Year before; of which Mr. <hi
              rend="italic">Rowe</hi> thus complains in his Prologue to one of his first Plays:</p>
          <lg type="verse">

          <p>While the Crowd, therefore, so fluctuated from one House to another as their Eyes were
            more or less regaled than their Ears, it could not be a Question much in Debate which
            had the better Actors; the Merit of either seem'd to be of little moment; and the
            Complaint in the foregoing Lines, tho' it might be just for a time, could not be a just
            one for ever, because the best Play that ever was writ may tire by being too often
            repeated, a Misfortune naturally attending the Obligation to play every Day; not that
              <pb n="318" entity="DSSR_000002909_0457"/> whenever such Satiety commences it will be
            any Proof of the Play's being a bad one, or of its being ill acted. In a word, Satiety
            is seldom enough consider'd by either Criticks, Spectators, or Actors, as the true, not
            to say just Cause of declining Audiences to the most rational Entertainments: And tho' I
            cannot say I ever saw a good new Play not attended with due Encouragement, yet to keep a
            Theatre daily open without sometimes giving the Publick a bad old one, is more than I
            doubt the Wit of human Writers or Excellence of Actors will ever be able to accomplish.
            And as both Authors and Comedians may have often succeeded where a sound Judgment would
            have condemn'd them, it might puzzle the nicest Critick living to prove in what sort of
            Excellence the true Value of either consisted: For if their Merit were to be measur'd by
            the full Houses they may have brought; if the Judgment of the Crowd were infallible; I
            am afraid we shall be reduc'd to allow that the <hi rend="italic">Beggars Opera</hi> was
            the best-written Play, and Sir <hi rend="italic">Harry Wildair</hi>
            <ref target="n318-1" n="363">[318.1]</ref> (as <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> play'd it)
            was the best acted Part, that ever our <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Theatre had to
            boast of. That Critick, indeed, must be rigid to a Folly that would deny either of them
            their due Praise, when they severally drew such Numbers after them; all their Hearers
            could not be mistaken; and yet, if they were all in the right, what sort of Fame will
            remain to those celebrated Authors <pb n="319" entity="DSSR_000002909_0458"/> and Actors
            that had so long and deservedly been admired before these were in Being. The only
            Distinction I shall make between them is, That to write or act like the Authors or
            Actors of the latter end of the last Century, I am of Opinion will be found a far better
            Pretence to Success than to imitate these who have been so crowded to in the beginning
            of this. All I would infer from this Explanation is, that tho' we had then the better
            Audiences, and might have more of the young World on our Side, yet this was no sure
            Proof that the other Company were not, in the Truth of Action, greatly our Superiors.
            These elder Actors, then, besides the Disadvantages I have mention'd, having only the
            fewer true Judges to admire them, naturally wanted the Support of the Crowd whose Taste
            was to be pleased at a cheaper Rate and with coarser Fare. To recover them, therefore,
            to their due Estimation, a new Project was form'd of building them a stately Theatre in
            the <hi rend="italic">Hay-Market,</hi>
            <ref target="n319-1" n="364">[319.1]</ref> by Sir <hi rend="italic">John Vanbrugh,</hi>
            for which he raised a Subscription of thirty Persons of Quality, at one hundred Pounds
            each, in Consideration whereof every Subscriber, for his own Life, was to be admitted to
            whatever Entertainments should be publickly perform'd there, without farther Payment for
            his Entrance. Of this Theatre I saw the <pb n="320" entity="DSSR_000002909_0459"/> first
            Stone laid, on which was inscrib'd <hi rend="italic">The little Whig,</hi> in Honour to
            a Lady of extraordinary Beauty, then the celebrated Toast and Pride of that Party. <ref
              target="n320-1" n="365">[320.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>In the Year 1706, <ref target="n320-2" n="366">[320.2]</ref> when this House was
            finish'd, <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi> and his Co-partners dissolved their own
            Agreement, and threw themselves under the Direction of Sir <hi rend="italic">John
              Vanbrugh</hi> and Mr. <hi rend="italic">Congreve,</hi> imagining, perhaps, that the
            Conduct of tow such eminent Authors might give a more prosperous Turn to their
            Condition; that the Plays it would now be their Interest to write for them would soon
            recover the Town to a true Taste, and be an Advantage that no other Company could hope
            for; that in the Interim, till such Plays could be written, the Grandeur of their House,
            as it was a new Spectacle, might allure the Crowd to support them: But if these were
            their Views, we shall see that their Dependence upon them was too sanguine. As to their
            Prospect of new Plays, I doubt it was not enough consider'd that good ones were Plants
            of a slow Growth; and tho' Sir <hi rend="italic">John Vanbrugh</hi> had a <pb n="321"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0460"/> very quick Pen, yet Mr. <hi rend="italic">Congreve</hi>
            was too judicious a Writer to let any thing come hastily out of his Hands: As to their
            other Dependence, the House, they had not yet discover'd that almost every proper
            Quality and Convenience of a good Theatre had been sacrificed or neglected to shew the
            Spectator a vast triumphal Piece of Architecture! And that the best Play, for the
            Reasons I am going to offer, could not but be under great Disadvantages, and be less
            capable of delighting the Auditor here than it could have been in the plain Theatre they
            came from. For what could their vast Columns, their gilded Cornices, their immoderate
            high Roofs avail, when scarce one Word in ten could be distinctly heard in it? Nor had
            it then the Form it now stands in, which Necessity, two or three Years after, reduced it
            to: At the first opening it, the flat Ceiling that is now over the Orchestre was then a
            Semi-oval Arch that sprung fifteen Feet higher from above the Cornice: The Ceiling over
            the Pit, too, was still more raised, being one level Line from the highest back part of
            the upper Gallery to the Front of the Stage: the Front-boxes were a continued Semicircle
            to the bare Walls of the House on each Side: This extraordinary and superfluous Space
            occasion'd such an Undulation from the Voice of every Actor, that generally what they
            said sounded like the Gabbling of so many People in the lofty Isles in a Cathedral
            &mdash;The Tone of a Trumpet, or the Swell of an Eunuch's holding Note, 'tis true,
            might be sweeten'd <pb n="322" entity="DSSR_000002909_0461"/> by it, but the articulate
            Sounds of a speaking Voice were drown'd by the hollow Reverberations of one Word upon
            another. To this Inconvenience, why may we not add that of its Situation; for at that
            time it had not the Advantage of almost a large City, which has since been built in its
            Neighbourhood: Those costly Spaces of <hi rend="italic">Hanover, Grosvenor,</hi> and <hi
              rend="italic">Cavendish</hi> Squares, with the many and great adjacent Streets about
            them, were then all but so many green Fields of Pasture, from whence they could draw
            little or no Sustenance, unless it were that of a Milk-Diet. The City, the Inns of
            Court, and the middle Part of the Town, which were the most constant Support of a
            Theatre, and chiefly to be relied on, were now too far out of the Reach of an easy Walk,
            and Coach-hire is often too hard a Tax upon the Pit and Gallery.<ref target="n322-1"
              n="367">[322.1]</ref> But from the vast Increase of the Buildings I have mention'd,
            the Situation of that Theatre has since that Time received considerable Advantages; a
            new World of People of Condition are nearer to it than formerly, and I am of Opinion
            that if the auditory Part were a little more reduced to the Model of that in <hi
              rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi>, an excellent <pb n="323" entity="DSSR_000002909_0462"/>
            Company of Actors would now find a better Account in it than in any other House in this
            populous City. <ref target="n323-1" n="368">[323.1]</ref> Let me not be mistaken, I say
            an excellent Company, and such as might be able to do Justice to the best of Plays, and
            throw out those latent Beauties in them which only excellent Actors can discover and
            give Life to. If such a Company were now there, they would meet with a quite different
            Set of Auditors than other Theatres have lately been used to: Polite Hearers would be
            content with polite Entertainments; and I remember the time when Plays, without the Aid
            of Farce or Pantomime, were as decently attended as Opera's or private Assemblies, where
            a noisy Sloven would have past his time as uneasily in a Front-box as in a Drawing-room;
            when a Hat upon a Man's Head there would have been look'd upon as a sure Mar, of a Brute
            or a Booby: But of all this I have seen, too, the Reverse, where in the Presence of
            Ladies at a Play common Civility has been set at defiance, and the Privilege of being a
            rude Clown, even to a Nusance, has in a manner been demanded as one of the Rights of <hi
              rend="italic">English</hi> Liberty: Now, though I grant that Liberty is so precious a
            Jewel that we ought not to suffer the least Ray of its Lustre to be diminish'd, yet
            methinks the Liberty of seeing a Play in quiet has as laudable a Claim to Protection as
            the Privilege of not suffering you to do it has to Impunity. But since we are so <pb
              n="324" entity="DSSR_000002909_0463"/> happy as not to have a certain Power among us,
            which in another Country is call'd the <hi rend="italic">Police,</hi> let us rather bear
            this Insult than buy its Remedy at too dear a Rate; and let it be the Punishment of such
            wrong-headed Savages, that they never will or can know the true Value of that Liberty
            which they so stupidly abuse: Such vulgar Minds possess their Liberty as profligate
            Husbands do fine Wives, only to disgrace them. In a Word, when Liberty boils over, such
            is the Scum of it. But to our new erected Theatre.</p>
          <p>Not long before this Time the <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> Opera began first to steal
            into <hi rend="italic">England</hi>, <ref target="n324-1" n="369">[324.1]</ref> but in
            as rude a disguise and unlike it self as possible; in a lame, hobling Translation into
            our own Language, with false Quantities, or Metre out of Measure to its original Notes,
            sung by our own unskilful Voices, with Graces misapply'd to almost every Sentiment, and
            with Action lifeless and unmeaning through every Character: The first <hi rend="italic"
              >Italian</hi> Performer that <pb n="325" entity="DSSR_000002909_0464"/> made any
            distinguish'd Figure in it was <hi rend="italic">Valentini,</hi> a true sensible Singer
            at that time, but of a Throat too weak to sustain those melodious Warblings for which
            the fairer Sex have since idoliz'd his Successors. However, this Defect was so well
            supply'd by his Action, that his Hearers bore with the Absurdity of his singing his
            first Part of <hi rend="italic">Turnus</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> all in <hi
              rend="italic">Italian,</hi> while every other Character was sung and recited to him in
              <hi rend="italic">English.</hi>
            <ref target="n325-1" n="370">[325.1]</ref> This I have mention'd to shew not only our
            Tramontane Taste, but that the crowded Audiences which follow'd it to <hi rend="italic"
              >Drury-Lane</hi> might be another Occasion of their growing thinner in <hi
              rend="italic">Lincolns-Inn-Fields.</hi></p>
          <p>To strike in, therefore, with this prevailing Novelty, Sir <hi rend="italic">John
              Vanbrugh</hi> and Mr. <hi rend="italic">Congreve</hi> open'd their new <hi
              rend="italic">Hay-Market Theatre</hi> with a translated Opera to <hi rend="italic"
              >Italian</hi> Musick, called the <hi rend="italic">Triumph of Love,</hi> but this not
            having in it the Charms of <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, either from the Inequality of
            the Musick or Voices, had but a cold Reception, being perform'd but three Days, and
            those not crowded. Immediately upon the Failure of this <hi rend="italic">Opera</hi>,
            Sir <hi rend="italic">John Vanbrugh</hi> produced his Comedy call'd the <hi
              rend="italic">Confederacy,</hi>
            <ref target="n326-1" n="371">[326.1]</ref>
            <pb n="326" entity="DSSR_000002909_0465"/> taken (but greatly improv'd) from the <hi
              rend="italic">Bourgeois &agrave; la mode</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Dancour:</hi>
            Though the Fate of this Play was something better, yet I thought it was not equal to its
            Merit: <ref target="n326-2" n="372">[326.2]</ref> For it is written with an uncommon
            Vein of Wit and Humour; which confirms me in my former Observation, that the difficulty
            of hearing distinctly in that then wide Theatre was no small Impediment to the Applause
            that might have followed the same Actors in it upon every other Stage; and indeed every
            Play acted there before the House was alter'd seemed to suffer from the same
            Inconvenience: In a Word, the Prospect of Profits from this Theatre was so very barren,
            that Mr. <hi rend="italic">Congreve</hi> in a few Months gave up his Share and Interest
            in the Government of it wholly to Sir <hi rend="italic">John Vanbrugh.</hi>
            <ref target="n326-3" n="373">[326.3]</ref> But Sir <hi rend="italic">John,</hi> being
            sole Proprietor of the House, was at all Events oblig'd to do his utmost to support it.
            As he had a happier Talent of throwing the <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Spirit into
            his Translation of <hi rend="italic">French</hi> Plays than any former Author who had
            borrowed from them, he in the same Season gave the Publick three more of that kind,
            call'd the <hi rend="italic">Cuckold in Conceit,</hi> from the <hi rend="italic">Cocu
              imaginaire</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Moliere</hi>; <ref target="n326-4" n="374"
              >[326.4]</ref>
            <hi rend="italic">Squire Trelooby,</hi>
            <pb n="327" entity="DSSR_000002909_0466"/> from his <hi rend="italic">Monsieur de
              Pourceaugnac,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Mistake,</hi> from the <hi rend="italic"
              >D&eacute;pit Amoureux</hi> of the same Author. <ref target="n327-1" n="375"
              >[327.1]</ref> Yet all these, however well executed, came to the Ear in the same
            Undistinguish'd Utterance by which almost all their Plays had equally suffered: For what
            few could plainly hear, it was not likely a great many could applaud.</p>
          <p>It must farther be consider'd, too, that this Company were not now what they had been
            when they first revolted from the Patentees in <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane,</hi> and
            became their own Masters in <hi rend="italic">Lincolns-Inn-Fields.</hi> Several of them,
            excellent in their different Talents, were now dead; as <hi rend="italic">Smith,
              Kynaston, Sandford,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Leigh:</hi> Mrs. <hi rend="italic"
              >Betterton</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Underhil</hi> being, at this time, also
            superannuated Pensioners whose Places were generally but ill supply'd: Nor could it be
            expected that <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi> himself, at past seventy, could retain
            his former Force and Spirit; though he was yet far distant from any Competitor. Thus,
            then, were these Remains of the best Set of Actors that I believe were ever known at
            once in <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> by Time, Death, and the Satiety of their
            Hearers, mould'ring to decay.</p>
          <p>It was now the Town-talk that nothing but a Union of the two Companies could recover
            the Stage to its former Reputation, <ref target="n327-2" n="376">[327.2]</ref> which
            Opinion was certainly <pb n="328" entity="DSSR_000002909_0467"/> true: One would have
            thought, too, that the Patentee of <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi> could not have
            fail'd to close with it, he being then on the Prosperous Side of the Question, having no
            Relief to ask for himself, and little more to do in the matter than to consider what he
            might safely grant: But it seems this was not his way of counting; he had other Persons
            who had great Claims to Shares in the Profits of this Stage, which Profits, by a Union,
            he foresaw would be too visible to be doubted of, and might raise up a new Spirit in
            those Adventurers to revive their Suits at Law with him; for he had led them a Chace in
            Chancery several Years, <ref target="n328-1" n="377">[328.1]</ref> and when they had
            driven him into a Contempt of that Court, he conjur'd up a Spirit, in the Shape of Six
            and eight Pence a-day, that constantly struck the Tipstaff blind whenever he came near
            him: He knew the intrinsick Value of Delay, and was resolv'd to stick to it as the
            surest way to give the Plaintiffs enough on't. And by this Expedient our good Master had
            long walk'd about at his Leisure, cool and contented as a Fox when the Hounds were drawn
            off and gone home from <pb n="329" entity="DSSR_000002909_0468"/> him. But whether I am
            right or not in my Conjuctures, certain it is that this close Master of <hi
              rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi> had no Inclination to a Union, as will appear by the
            Sequel. <ref target="n329-1" n="378">[329.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>Sir <hi rend="italic">John Vanbrugh</hi> knew, too, that to make a Union worth his
            while he must not seem too hasty for it; he therefore found himself under a Necessity,
            in the mean time, of letting his whole Theatrical Farm to some industrious Tenant that
            might put it into better Condition. This is that Crisis, as I observed in the Eighth
            Chapter, when the Royal Licence for acting Plays, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> was
            judg'd of so little Value as not to have one Suitor for it. At this time, then, the
            Master of <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi> happen'd to have a sort of primier Agent in
            his Stage-Affairs, that seem'd in Appearance as much to govern the Master as the Master
            himself did to govern his Actors: But this Person was under no Stipulation or Sallary
            for the Service he render'd, but had gradually wrought himself into the Master's
            extraordinary Confidence and Trust, from an habitual Intimacy, a cheerful Humour, <pb
              n="330" entity="DSSR_000002909_0469"/> and an indefatigable Zeal for his Interest. If
            I should farther say, that this Person has been well known in almost every Metropolis in
              <hi rend="italic">Europe</hi>; that few private Men have, with so little Reproach, run
            through more various Turns of Fortune; that, on the wrong side of Three-score, he has
            yet the open Spirit of a hale young Fellow of five and twenty; that though he still
            chuses to speak what he thinks to his best Friends with an undisguis'd Freedom, he is,
            notwithstanding, acceptable to many Persons of the first Rank and Condition; that any
            one of them (provided he likes them) may now send him, for their Service, to <hi
              rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> at half a Day's Warning; that Time has not yet been
            able to make a visible Change in any Part of him but the Colour of his Hair, from a
            fierce coal-black to that of a milder milk-white: When I have taken this Liberty with
            him, methinks it cannot be taking a much greater if I at once should tell you that this
            Person was Mr. <hi rend="italic">Owen Swiney,</hi>
            <ref target="n330-1" n="379">[330.1]</ref> and that it was to him sir <hi rend="italic"
              >John</hi>
            <pb n="331" entity="DSSR_000002909_0470"/>
            <hi rend="italic">Vanbrugh,</hi> in this Exigence of his Theatrical Affairs, made an
            Offer of his Actors, under such Agreements of Sallary as might be made with them; and of
            his House, Cloaths, and Scenes, with the Queen's License to employ them, upon Payment of
            only the casual Rent of five Pounds upon every acting Day, and not to exceed 700<hi
              rend="italic">l.</hi> in the Year. Of this Proposal Mr. <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi>
            desir'd a Day or two to consider; for, however he might like it, he would not meddle in
            any sort without the Consent and Approbation of his Friend and Patron, the Master of <hi
              rend="italic">Drury Lane.</hi> Having given the Reasons why this Patentee was averse
            to a Union, it may now seem less a Wonder why he immediately consented that <hi
              rend="italic">Swiney</hi> should take the <hi rend="italic">Hay-Market</hi> House, <hi
              rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> and continue that Company to act against him; but the
            real Truth was, that he had a mind both Companies should be clandestinely under one and
            the same Interest, and yet in so loose a manner that he might declare his Verbal
            Agreement with <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> good, or null and void, as he might best
            find his Account in either. What flatter'd him that he had this wholsom <pb n="332"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0471"/> Project, and <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> to execute
            it, both in his Power, was that at this time <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> happen'd to
            stand in his Books Debtor to Cash upwards of Two Hundred Pounds: But here, we shall
            find, he over-rated his Security. However, <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> as yet follow'd
            his Orders; he took the <hi rend="italic">Hay-Market</hi> Theatre, and had, farther, the
            private Consent of the Patentee to take such of his Actors from <hi rend="italic"
              >Drury-Lane</hi> as either from Inclination or Discontent, might be willing to come
            over to him in the <hi rend="italic">Hay-Market.</hi> The only one he made an exception
            of, was myself: For tho' he chiefly depended upon his Singers and Dancers, <ref
              target="n332-1" n="380">[332.1]</ref> he said it would be necessary to keep some one
            tolerable Actor with him, that might enable him to set those Machines a going. Under
            this Limitation of not entertaining me, <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> seem'd to
            acquiesce 'till after he had open'd with the so recruited Company in the <hi
              rend="italic">Hay-Market:</hi> the Actors that came to him from <hi rend="italic"
              >Drury-Lane</hi> were <hi rend="italic">Wilks, Estcourt,</hi>
            <ref target="n332-2" n="381">[332.2]</ref>
            <hi rend="italic">Mills, Keen,</hi>

            <hi rend="italic">Johnson, Bullock,</hi> Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield,</hi> Mrs. <hi
              rend="italic">Rogers,</hi> and some few others of less note: But I must here let you
            know that this Project was form'd and put in Execution all in very few Days, in the
            Summer-Season, <pb n="333" entity="DSSR_000002909_0472"/> when no Theatre was open. To
            all which I was entirely a Stranger, being at this time at a Gentleman's House in <hi
              rend="italic">Gloucestershire,</hi> scribbling, if I mistake not, the <hi
              rend="italic">Wife's Resentment.</hi>
            <ref target="n333-1" n="383">[333.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>The first Word I heard of this Transaction was by a Letter from <hi rend="italic"
              >Swiney,</hi> inviting me to make One in the <hi rend="italic">Hay-Market</hi>
            Company, whom he hop'd I could not but now think the stronger Party. But I confess I was
            not a little alarm'd at this Revolution: For I consider'd, that I knew of no visible
            Fund to support these Actors but their own Industry; that all his Recruits from <hi
              rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi> would want new Cloathing; and that the warmest Industry
            would be always labouring up Hill under so necessary an Expence, so bad a Situation, and
            so inconvenient a Theatre. I was always of opinion, too, that in changing Sides, in most
            Conditions, there generally were discovered more unforeseen Inconveniencies than visible
            Advantages; and that at worst there would always some sort of Merit remain with
            Fidelity, tho' unsuccessful. Upon these Considerations I was <pb n="334"
              entity="DSSR_000002909_0473"/> only thankful for the Offers made me from the <hi
              rend="italic">Hay-Market,</hi> without accepting them, and soon after came to Town
            towards the usual time of their beginning to act, to offer my Service to our old Master.
            But I found our Company so thinn'd that it was almost impracticable to bring any one
            tolerable Play upon the Stage. <ref target="n334-1" n="384">[334.1]</ref> When I ask'd
            him where were his Actors, and in what manner he intended to proceed? he reply'd, <hi
              rend="italic">Don't you trouble yourself, come along, and I'll shew you.</hi> He then
            led me about all the By-places in the House, and shew'd me fifty little Back-doors, dark
            Closets, and narrow Passages; in Alterations and Contrivances of which kind he had
            busied his Head most part of the Vacation; for he was scarce ever without some notable
            Joyner, or a Brick-layer extraordinary, in pay, for twenty Years. And there are so many
            odd obscure Places about a Theatre, that his Genius in Nook-building was never out of
            Employment; nor could the most vain-headed Author be more deaf to an Interruption in
            reciting his Works, than our wise Master was while entertaining me with the Improvements
            he had made in his invisible Architecture; all which, without thinking any one Part of
            it necessary, tho' I seem'd to approve, I could not help now and then breaking in upon
            his Delight with the impertinent Question of <pb n="335" entity="DSSR_000002909_0474"/>
              &mdash;<hi rend="italic">But, Master, where are your Actors?</hi> But it seems I
            had taken a wrong time for this sort of Enquiry; his Head was full of Matters of more
            moment, and (as you find) I was to come another time for an Answer: A very hopeful
            Condition I found myself in, under the Conduct of so profound a Vertuoso and so
            considerate a Master! But to speak of him seriously, and to account for this Disregard
            to his Actors, his Notion was that Singing and Dancing, or any sort of Exotick
            Entertainments, would make an ordinary Company of Actors too hard for the best Set who
            had only plain Plays to subsist on. Now, though I am afraid too much might be said in
            favour of this Opinion, yet I thought he laid more Stress upon that sort of Merit than
            it would bear; as I therefore found myself of so little Value with him, I could not help
            setting a little more upon myself, and was resolv'd to come to a short Explanation with
            him. I told him I came to serve him at a time when many of his best Actors had deserted
            him; that he might now have the refusal of me; but I could not afford to carry the
            Compliment so far as to lessen my Income by it; that I therefore expected either my
            casual Pay to be advanced, or the Payment of my former Sallary made certain for as many
            Days as we had acted the Year before.&mdash;No, he was not willing to alter his
            former Method; but I might chuse whatever Parts I had a mind to act of theirs who had
            left him. When I found him, as I thought, to insensible or impregnable, I look'd gravely
            in his <pb n="336" entity="DSSR_000002909_0475"/> Face, and told him&mdash;He knew
            upon what Terms I was willing to serve him, and took my leave. By this time the <hi
              rend="italic">Hay-Market</hi> Company had begun acting to Audiences something better
            than usual, and were all paid their full Sallaries, a Blessing they had not felt in some
            Years in either House before. Upon this Success <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> press'd
            the Patentee to execute the Articles they had as yet only verbally agreed on, which were
            in Substance, That <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> should take the <hi rend="italic"
              >Hay-Market</hi> House in his own Name, and have what Actors he thought necessary from
              <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane,</hi> and after all Payments punctually made, the Profits
            should be equally divided between these two Undertakers. But soft and fair! Rashness was
            a Fault that had never yet been imputed to the Patentee; certain Payments were Methods
            he had not of a long, long time been us'd to; that Point still wanted time for
            Consideration. But <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> was as hasty as the other was slow, and
            was resolv'd to know what he had to trust to before they parted; and to keep him the
            closer to his Bargain, he stood upon his Right of having <hi rend="italic">Me</hi> added
            to that Company if I was willing to come into it. But this was a Point as absolutely
            refus'd on one side as insisted on on the other. In this Contest high Words were
            exchang'd on both sides, 'till, in the end, this their last private Meeting came to an
            open Rupture: But before it was publickly known, <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi>, by
            fairly letting me into the whole Transaction, took effectual means to secure me in his
            Interest. When the Mystery of the Patentee's <pb n="337" entity="DSSR_000002909_0476"/>
            Indifference to me was unfolded, and that his slighting me was owing to the Security he
            rely'd on of <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi>'s not daring to engage me, I could have no
            further Debate with my self which side of the Question I should adhere to. To conclude,
            I agreed, in two Words, to act with <hi rend="italic">Swiney,</hi>
            <ref target="n337-1" n="385">[337.1]</ref> and from this time every Change that happen'd
            in the Theatrical Government was a nearer Step to that twenty Years of Prosperity which
            Actors, under the Menagement of Actors, not long afterwards enjoy'd. What was the
            immediate Consequence of this last Desertion from <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi>
            shall be the Subject of another Chapter.</p>

            <p> Of Horden we now little more than Cibber tells us. He seems to have been on the
              stage only for a year or two; and during 1696 only, at Drury Lane, does his name
              appear to important parts. Davies ("Dram. Misc.," iii. 443) says Horden "was bred a
              Scholar: he complimented George Powell, in a Latin encomium on his Treacherous
              Brothers."</p>

            <p> This tavern seems to have been very near Drury Lane Theatre, and to have been a
              favourite place of resort after the play. In the Epilogue to the "Constant Couple" the
              Rose Tavern is mentioned:&mdash;</p>

            <p>In the "Comparison between the two Stages" one scene is laid in the Rose Tavern, and
              from it we gather that the house was of a very bad character:&mdash; </p>

              play, "The Mulberry Garden," the diarist, having secured his place in the pit, and
              feeling hungry, "did slip out, getting a boy to keep my place; and to the Rose Tavern,
              and there got half a breast of mutton, off the spit, and dined all alone. And so to
              the play again."</p>

            <p> Cibber's chronology cannot be reconciled with what we believe to be facts. Horden
              was killed in 1696; Wilks seems to have come to England not earlier than the end of
              1698, while it is, I should say, certain that Estcourt did not appear before 1704. I
              can only suppose that Cibber, who is very reckless in his dates, is here particularly

            <p> Mrs. Anne Oldfield, born about 1683, was introduced to Vanbrugh by Farquhar, who
              accidentally heard her reading aloud, and was struck by her dramatic style. Cibber
              gives so full an account of her that it is only necessary to add that she made her
              last appearance on 28th April, 1730, at Drury Lane, and that she died on the 23rd
              October in the same year. It was of Mrs. Oldfield that Pope wrote the often-quoted
              lines ("Moral Essays," Epistle I., Part iii.):&mdash;</p>

            <p> Mrs. Oldfield played Lady Townly in the "Provoked Husband," 10th January, 1728. I
              presume that Cibber means that this was her last <hi rend="italic">important</hi>
              original part, for she was the original representative of Sophonisba (by James
              Thomson) and other characters after January, 1728.</p>

            <p> The following is the passage referred to:&mdash;</p>
            <p>"But there is no doing right to Mrs. Oldfield, without putting people in mind of what
              others, of great merit, have wanted to come near her&mdash;'Tis not enough to say,
              she here outdid her usual excellence. I might therefore justly leave her to the
              constant admiration of those spectators who have the pleasure of living while she is
              an actress. But as this is not the only time she has been the life of what I have
              given the public, so, perhaps, y saying a little more of so memorable an actress, may
              give this play a chance to be read when the people of this age shall be
              ancestors&mdash;May it therefore give emulation to our successors of the stage, to
              know, that to the ending of the year 1727, a cotemporary comedian relates, that Mrs.
              Oldfield was then in her highest excellence of action, happy in all the rarely found
              requisites that meet in one person to complete them for the stage. She was in stature
              just rising to that height, where the graceful can only begin to show itself; of a
              lively aspect, and a command in her mien, that like the principal figure in the finest
              painting, first seizes, and longest delights, the eye of the spectators. Her voice was
              sweet, strong, piercing, and melodious; her pronunciation voluble, distinct, and
              musical; and her emphasis always placed, where the spirit of the sense, in her
              periods, only demanded it. If she delighted more in the higher comic, than in the
              tragic strain, 'twas because the last is too often written in a lofty disregard of
              nature. But in characters of modern practised life, she found occasion to add the
              particular air and manner which distinguished the different humours she presented;
              whereas, in tragedy, the manner of speaking varies as little as the blank verse it is
              written in.&mdash;She had one peculiar happiness from nature, she looked and
              maintained the agreeable, at a time when other fine women only raise admirers by their
              understanding&mdash;The spectator was always as much informed by her eyes as her
              elocution; for the look is the only proof that an actor rightly conceives what he
              utters, there being scarce an instance, where the eyes do their part, that the
              elocution is known to be faulty. The qualities she had acquired, were the genteel and
              the elegant; the one in her air, and the other in her dress, never had her equal on
              the stage; and the ornaments she herself provided (particularly in this play) seemed
              in all respects the <hi rend="italic">paraphernalia</hi> of a woman of quality. And of
              that sort were the characters she chiefly excelled in; but her natural good sense, and
              lively turn of conversation, made her way so easy to ladies of the highest rank, that
              it is a less wonder if, on the stage, she sometimes was, what might have become the
              finest woman in real life to have supported." [Bell's edition.]</p>

            <p> Mr. Julian Marshall, in his "Annals of Tennis," p. 34, describes the two different
              sorts of tennis courts&mdash;"that which was called <hi rend="italic">Le
                Quarr&eacute;,</hi> or the Square; and the other with the <hi rend="italic"
                >dedans,</hi> which is almost the same as that of the present day." Cibber is thus

            <p> Interesting confirmation of Cibber's statement is furnished by an edict of the Lord
              Chamberlain, dated 11th November, 1700, by which Betterton is ordered "to take upon
              him y<hi rend="super">e</hi> sole management" of the Lincoln's Inn Fields company,
              there having been great disorders, "for want of sufficient authority to keep them to
              their duty." See David Craufurd's Preface to "Courtship &agrave; la Mode" (1700),
              for an account of the disorganized state of the Lincoln's Inn Fields Company. He says
              that though Betterton did his best, some of the actors neither learned their parts nor
              attended rehearsals; and he therefore withdrew his comedy and took it to Drury Lane,
              where it was promptly produced.</p>

            <p> A junction of the companies seems to have been talked of as early as 1701. In the
              Prologue to "The Unhappy Penitent" (1701), the lines occur:&mdash;</p>
            <lg type="verse">
              <l>"But now the peaceful tattle of the town,</l>

            <p> In "The Post-Boy Rob'd of his Mail," p. 342, some curious particulars of the
              negotiations for a Union are given. One of Rich's objections to it is that he has to
              consider the interests of his Partners, with some of whom he has already been
              compelled to go to law on monetary questions.</p>

            <p> In July, 1705, Rich was approached on behalf of Vanbrugh regarding a Union, and the
              Lord Chamberlain supported the latter's proposal. Rich, in declining, wrote: "I am
              concern'd with above forty Persons in number, either as Adventurers under the two
              Patents granted to Sir <hi rend="italic">William Davenant,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

              Patents, to above the value of two Thousand Pounds (a great part of which was under
              the Marriage-Settlements of Dr. <hi rend="italic">Davenant</hi>)."&mdash;"The

            <p> Owen Swiney, or Mac Swiney, was an Irishman. As is related by Cibber in this and
              following chapters, he leased the Haymarket from Vanbrugh from the beginning of the
              season 1706-7. At the Union, 1707-8, the Haymarket was made over to him for the
              production of operas; and when, at the end of 1708-9, Rich was ordered to silence his
              company at Drury Lane, Swiney was allowed to engage the chief of Rich's actors to play
              at the Haymarket, where they opened September, 1709. At the beginning of season
              1710-11, Swiney and his partners became managers of Drury Lane, but Swiney was forced
              at the end of that season to resume the management of the operas. After a year of the
              Opera-house (end of 1711-12), Swiney was ruined and had to go abroad. He remained
              abroad some twenty years. On 26th February, 1735, he had a benefit at Drury Lane, at
              which Cibber played for his old friend. The "Biographia Dramatica" says that he
              received a place in the Custom House, and was made Keeper of the King's Mews. He died
              2nd October, 1754, leaving his property to Mrs. Woffington. Davies, in his "Dramatic
              Miscellanies" (i. 232), tells an idle tale of a scuffle between Swiney and Mrs.
              Clive's brother, which Bellchambers quotes at length, though it has no special
              reference to anything.</p>

            <p> At Drury Lane this season (1706-7) very few plays were acted, Rich relying chiefly

            <p> Cibber seems to be wrong in including Estcourt in this list. His name appears in the
              Drury Lane bills for 1706-7, and his great part of Sergeant Kite ("Recruiting
              Officer") was played at the Haymarket by Pack. On 30th November, 1706, it was
              advertised that "the true Sergeant Kite is performed at Drury Lane."</p>

              Griffin, Mrs. Tofts, Mrs. Mountfort (that is, the great Mrs. Mountfort's daughter),

            <p> Swiney's company began to act at the Haymarket on 15th October, 1706. Cibber's first
              appearance seems to have been on 7th November, when he played Lord Foppington in "The
              Careless Husband."</p>
