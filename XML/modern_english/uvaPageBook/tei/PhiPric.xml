<p>HENRY GOWER was dead at sixty-one&mdash;the end of 
a lifelong fraud which never had been suspected, and 
never would be.  With the world, with his acquaintances 
and neighbors, with his wife and son and 
daughter, he passed as a generous, warm-hearted, 
good-natured man, ready at all times to do anything 
to help anybody, incapable of envy or hatred or 
meanness.  In fact, not once in all his days had he ever 
thought or done a single thing except for his own 
comfort.  Like all intensely selfish people who are wise, 
he was cheerful and amiable, because that was the 
way to be healthy and happy and to have those around 
one agreeable and in the mood to do what one wished 
them to do.  He told people, not the truth, not the 
unpleasant thing that might help them, but what they 
wished to hear.  His family lived in luxurious comfort 
only because he himself was fond of luxurious comfort. 
His wife and his daughter dressed fashionably and 
went about and entertained in the fashionable, 
expensive way only because that was the sort of life 
that gratified his vanity.  He lived to get what he 
wanted; he got it every day and every hour of a life 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0015" n="2"/>  
into which no rain ever fell; he died, honored, respected, 
beloved, and lamented. 
</p><p>The clever trick he had played upon his fellow 
beings came very near to discovery a few days after 
his death.  His widow and her son and daughter-in-law 
and daughter were in the living-room of the charming 
house at Hanging Rock, near New York, alternating 
between sorrowings over the dead man and plannings 
for the future.  Said the widow: 
</p><p>"If Henry had only thought what would become of 
us if he were taken away!'' 
</p><p>"If he had saved even a small part of what he made 
every year from the time he was twenty-six&mdash;for he 
always made a big income,'' said his son, Frank. 
</p><p>"But he was so generous, so soft-hearted!'' 
exclaimed the widow.  "He could deny us nothing.'' 
</p><p>"He couldn't bear seeing us with the slightest wish 
ungratified,'' said Frank. 
</p><p>"He was the best father that ever lived!'' cried the 
daughter, Mildred. 
</p><p>And Mrs. Gower the elder and Mrs. Gower the 
younger wept; and Mildred turned away to hide the 
emotion distorting her face; and Frank stared gloomily 
at the carpet and sighed.  The hideous secret of the 
life of duplicity was safe, safe forever. 
</p><p>In fact, Henry Gower had often thought of the fate 
of his family if he should die.  In the first year of 
his married life, at a time when passion for a beautiful 
bride was almost sweeping him into generous thought, 
he had listened for upward of an hour to the eloquence 
of a life insurance agent.  Then the agent, misled by 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0016" n="3"/>  
Gower's effusively generous and unselfish expressions, 
had taken a false tack.  He had descanted upon the 
supreme satisfaction that would be felt by a dying man 
as he reflected how his young widow would be left in 
affluence.  He made a vivid picture; Gower saw&mdash; 
saw his bride happier after his death than she had been 
during his life, and attracting a swarm of admirers 
by her beauty, well set off in becoming black, and by 
her independent income.  The generous impulse then 
and there shriveled to its weak and shallow roots.  With 
tears in his kind, clear eyes he thanked the agent and 
said: 
</p><p>"You have convinced me.  You need say no more. 
I'll send for you in a few days.'' 
</p><p>The agent never got into his presence again. 
Gower lived up to his income, secure in the knowledge 
that his ability as a lawyer made him certain of plenty 
of money as long as he should live.  But it would show 
an utter lack of comprehension of his peculiar species 
of character to imagine that he let himself into the 
secret of his own icy-heartedness by ceasing to think 
of the problem of his wife and two children without 
him to take care of them.  On the contrary, he thought 
of it every day, and planned what he would do about 
it&mdash;to-morrow.  And for his delay he had excellent 
convincing excuses.  Did he not take care of his 
naturally robust health?  Would he not certainly out-live his wife, who was always doctoring more or less? 
Frank would be able to take care of himself; anyhow, 
it was not well to bring a boy up to expectations, 
because every man should be self-supporting and self-
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0017" n="4"/>  
reliant.  As for Mildred, why, with her beauty and her 
cleverness she could not but make a brilliant marriage. 
Really, there was for him no problem of an orphaned 
family's future; there was no reason why he should deny 
himself any comfort or luxury, or his vanity any of 
the titillations that come from social display. 
</p><p>That one of his calculations which was the most vital 
and seemed the surest proved to be worthless.  It is 
not the weaklings who die, after infancy and youth, 
but the strong, healthy men and women.  The weaklings 
have to look out for themselves, receive ample 
warning in the disastrous obvious effects of the 
slightest imprudence.  The robust, even the wariest of them, 
even the Henry Gowers, overestimate and overtax their 
strength.  Gower's downfall was champagne.  He 
could not resist a bottle of it for dinner every night. 
As so often happens, the collapse of the kidneys came 
without any warning that a man of powerful constitution 
would deem worthy of notice.  By the time the 
doctor began to suspect the gravity of his trouble he 
was too far gone. 
</p><p>Frank, candidly greedy and selfish&mdash;"Such a 
contrast to his father!'' everyone said&mdash;was married to 
the prettiest girl in Hanging Rock and had a 
satisfactory law practice in New York.  His income was 
about fifteen thousand a year.  But his wife had tastes 
as extravagant as his own; and Hanging Rock is one 
of those suburbs of New York where gather well-to-do 
middle-class people to live luxuriously and to delude 
each other and themselves with the notion that they are 
fashionable, rich New Yorkers who prefer to live in 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0018" n="5"/> 
the country "like the English.''  Thus, Henry 
Gower's widow and daughter could count on little help 
from Frank&mdash;and they knew it. 
</p><p>"You and Milly will have to move to some less 
expensive place than Hanging Rock,'' said Frank&mdash;it 
was the living-room conference a few days after the 
funeral. 
</p><p>Mildred flushed and her eyes flashed.  She opened 
her lips to speak&mdash;closed them again with the angry 
retort unuttered.  After all, Frank was her mother's 
and her sole dependence.  They could hope for little 
from him, but nothing must be said that would give 
him and his mean, selfish wife a chance to break with 
them and refuse to do anything whatever. 
</p><p>"And Mildred must get married,'' said Natalie. 
In Hanging Rock most of the girls and many of the 
boys had given names taken from Burke's Peerage, the 
Almanac de Gotha, and fashionable novels. 
</p><p>Again Mildred flushed; but her eyes did not flash, 
neither did she open her lips to speak.  The little 
remark of her sister-in-law, apparently so harmless and 
sensible, was in fact a poisoned arrow.  For Mildred 
was twenty-three, had been "out'' five years, and was 
not even in the way to become engaged.  She and everyone 
had assumed from her lovely babyhood that she 
would marry splendidly, would marry wealth and social 
position.  How could it be otherwise?  Had she not 
beauty?  Had she not family and position?  Had she 
not style and cleverness?  Yet&mdash;five years out and 
not a "serious'' proposal.  An impudent poor fellow 
with no prospects had asked her.  An impudent rich 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0019" n="6"/> 
man from fashionable New York had hung after her 
&mdash;and had presently abandoned whatever dark projects 
he may have been concealing and had married in 
his own set, "as they always do, the miserable snobs,'' 
raved Mrs. Gower, who had been building high upon 
those lavish outpourings of candy, flowers, and automobile 
rides.  Mildred, however, had accepted the defection 
more philosophically.  She had had enough vanity 
to like the attentions of the rich and fashionable 
New Yorker, enough good sense to suspect, perhaps 
not definitely, what those attentions meant, but 
certainly what they did not mean.  Also, in the back of 
her head had been an intention to refuse Stanley Baird, 
if by chance he should ask her.  Was there any 
substance to this intention, sprung from her disliking 
the conceited, self-assured snob as much as she liked 
his wealth and station?  Perhaps not.  Who can 
say?  At any rate, may we not claim credit for our 
good intentions&mdash;so long as, even through lack of 
opportunity, we have not stultified them? 
</p><p>With every natural advantage apparently, Mildred's 
failure to catch a husband seemed to be somehow her 
own fault.  Other girls, less endowed than she, were 
marrying, were marrying fairly well.  Why, then, was 
Mildred lagging in the market? 
</p><p>There may have been other reasons, reasons of 
accident&mdash;for, in the higher class matrimonial market, 
few are called and fewer chosen.  There was one reason 
not accidental; Hanging Rock was no place for a girl 
so superior as was Mildred Gower to find a fitting 
husband.  As has been hinted, Hanging Rock was one 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0020" n="7"/>  
of those upper-middle-class colonies where splurge and 
social ambition dominate the community life.  In such 
colonies the young men are of two classes&mdash;those beneath 
such a girl as Mildred, and those who had the 
looks, the manners, the intelligence, and the prospects 
to justify them in looking higher socially&mdash;in looking 
among the very rich and really fashionable.  In the 
Hanging Rock sort of community, having all the 
snobbishness of Fifth Avenue, Back Bay, and Rittenhouse 
Square, with the added torment of the snobbishness 
being perpetually ungratified&mdash;in such communities, 
beneath a surface reeking culture and idealistic folderol, 
there is a coarse and brutal materialism, a passion for 
money, for luxury, for display, that equals aristocratic 
societies at their worst.  No one can live for a winter, 
much less grow up, in such a place without becoming 
saturated with sycophantry.  Thus, only by some 
impossible combination of chances could there have been 
at Hanging Rock a young man who would have 
appreciated Mildred and have had the courage of 
his appreciation.  This combination did not happen. 
In Mildred's generation and set there were only the 
two classes of men noted above.  The men of the one 
of them which could not have attracted her accepted 
their fate of mating with second-choice females to whom 
they were themselves second choice.  The men of the 
other class rarely appeared at Hanging Rock functions, 
hung about the rich people in New York, Newport, 
and on Long Island, and would as soon have thought 
of taking a Hanging Rock society girl to wife as of 
exchanging hundred-dollar bills for twenty-five-cent 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0021" n="8"/>  
pieces.  Having attractions acceptable in the best 
markets, they took them there.  Hanging Rock 
denounced them as snobs, for Hanging Rock was 
virtuously eloquent on the subject of snobbishness&mdash;we 
human creatures being never so effective as when 
assailing in others the vice or weakness we know from 
lifelong, intimate, internal association with it.  But 
secretly the successfully ambitious spurners of that 
suburban society were approved, were envied.  And 
Hanging Rock was most gracious to them whenever 
it got the chance. 
</p><p>In her five years of social life Mildred had gone 
only with the various classes of fashionable people, 
had therefore known only the men who are full of the 
poison of snobbishness.  She had been born and bred 
in an environment as impregnated with that poison 
as the air of a kitchen-garden with onions.  She knew 
nothing else.  The secret intention to refuse Stanley 
Baird, should he propose, was therefore the more 
astonishing&mdash;and the more significant.  From time to 
time in any given environment you will find some 
isolated person, some personality, with a trait wholly 
foreign and out of place there.  Now it is a soft voice 
and courteous manners in a slum; again it is a longing 
for a life of freedom and equality in a member of a 
royal family that has known nothing but sordid slavery 
for centuries.  Or, in the petty conventionality of a 
prosperous middle-or upper-class community you 
come upon one who dreams&mdash;perhaps vaguely but 
still longingly&mdash;of an existence where love and ideas 
shall elevate and glorify life.  In spite of her training, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0022" n="9"/>  
in spite of the teaching and example of all about her 
from the moment of her opening her eyes upon the 
world, Mildred Gower at twenty-three still retained 
something of these dream flowers sown in the soil of 
her naturally good mind by some book or play or perhaps 
by some casually read and soon forgotten article 
in magazine or newspaper.  We have the habit of 
thinking only weeds produce seeds that penetrate and 
prosper everywhere and anywhere.  The truth is that 
fine plants of all kinds, vegetable, fruit, and flower of 
rarest color and perfume, have this same hardiness and 
fecundity.  Pull away at the weeds in your garden 
for a while, and see if this is not so.  Though you may 
plant nothing, you will be amazed at the results if you 
but clear a little space of its weeds&mdash;which you have 
been planting and cultivating. 
</p><p>Mildred&mdash;woman fashion&mdash;regarded it as a 
reproach upon her that she had not yet succeeded in 
making the marriage everyone, including herself, predicted 
for her and expected of her.  On the contrary, it was 
the most savage indictment possible of the marriageable 
and marrying men who had met her&mdash;of their 
stupidity, of their short-sighted and mean-souled 
calculation, of their lack of courage&mdash;the courage to 
take what they, as men of flesh and blood wanted, 
instead of what their snobbishness ordered.  And if 
Stanley Baird, the nearest to a flesh-and-blood man of 
any who had known her, had not been so profoundly 
afraid of his fashionable mother and of his sister, the 
Countess of Waring&mdash;  But he was profoundly afraid 
of them; so, it is idle to speculate about him.

</p><p>What did men see when they looked at Mildred 
Gower?  Usually, when men look at a woman, they 
have a hazy, either pleasant or unpleasant, sense of 
something feminine.  That, and nothing more.  Afterward, 
through some whim or some thrust from chance 
they may see in her, or fancy they see in her, the thing 
feminine that their souls&mdash;it is always "soul''&mdash;most 
yearns after.  But just at first glance, so colorless or 
conventionally colored is the usual human being, the 
average woman&mdash;indeed every woman but she who is 
exceptional&mdash;creates upon man the mere impression of 
pleasant or unpleasant petticoats.  In the exceptional 
woman something obtrudes.  She has astonishing hair, 
or extraordinary eyes, or a mouth that seems to draw a 
man like a magnet; or it is the allure of a peculiar 
smile or of a figure whose sinuosities as she moves 
seem to cause a corresponding wave-disturbance in 
masculine nerves.  Further, the possession of one of 
these signal charms usually causes all her charms to 
have more than ordinary potency.  The sight of the 
man is so bewitched by the one potent charm that he 
sees the whole woman under a spell. 
</p><p>Mildred Gower, of the medium height and of a 
slender and well-formed figure, had a face of the kind 
that is called lovely; and her smile, sweet, dreamy, 
revealing white and even teeth, gave her loveliness 
delicate animation.  She had an abundance of hair, neither 
light nor dark; she had a fine clear skin.  Her eyes, 
gray and rather serious and well set under long straight 
brows, gave her a look of honesty and intelligence. 
But the charm that won men, her charm of charms, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0024" n="11"/>  
was her mouth&mdash;mobile, slightly pouted, not too narrow, 
of a wonderful, vividly healthy and vital red.  She 
had beauty, she had intelligence.  But it was impossible 
for a man to think of either, once his glance had 
been caught by those expressive, inviting lips of hers, 
so young, so fresh, with their ever-changing, ever-fascinating line expressing in a thousand ways the 
passion and poetry of the kiss. 
</p><p>Of all the men who had admired her and had edged 
away because they feared she would bewitch them into 
forgetting what the world calls "good common sense'' 
&mdash;of all those men only one had suspected the real 
reason for her physical power over men.  All but Stanley 
Baird had thought themselves attracted because she 
was so pretty or so stylish or so clever and amusing to 
talk with.  Baird had lived intelligently enough to 
learn that feminine charm is never general, is always 
specific.  He knew it was Mildred Gower's lips that 
haunted, that frightened ambitious men away, that 
sent men who knew they hadn't a ghost of a chance 
with her discontentedly back to the second-choice 
women who alone were available for them.  Fortunately 
for Mildred, Stanley Baird, too wise to flatter 
a woman discriminatingly, did not tell her the secret 
of her fascination.  If he had told her, she would no 
doubt have tried to train and to use it&mdash;and so would 
inevitably have lost it. 
</p><p>To go on with that important conference in the 
sitting-room in the handsome, roomy house of the Gowers 
at Hanging Rock, Frank Gower eagerly seized upon his 
wife's subtly nasty remark.  "I don't see why in 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0025" n="12"/>  
thunder you haven't married, Milly,'' said he.  "You've 
had every chance, these last four or five years.'' 
</p><p>"And it'll be harder now,'' moaned her mother. 
"For it looks as though we were going to be wretchedly 
poor.  And poverty is so repulsive.'' 
</p><p>"Do you think,'' said Mildred, "that giving me the 
idea that I must marry right away will make it easier 
for me to marry?  Everyone who knows us knows our 
circumstances.''  She looked significantly at Frank's 
wife, who had been wailing through Hanging Rock 
the woeful plight of her dead father-in-law's family. 
The young Mrs. Gower blushed and glanced away. 
"And,'' Mildred went on, "everyone is saying that I 
must marry at once&mdash;that there's nothing else for me 
to do.''  She smiled bitterly.  "When I go into the 
street again I shall see nothing but flying men.  And 
no man would come to call unless he brought a chaperon 
and a witness with him.'' 
</p><p>"How can you be so frivolous?'' reproached her 
mother. 
</p><p>Mildred was used to being misunderstood by her 
mother, who had long since been made hopelessly dull 
by the suffocating life she led and by pain from her 
feet, which never left her at ease for a moment except 
when she had them soaking in cold water.  Mrs. Gower 
had been born with ordinary feet, neither ugly nor 
pretty and entirely fit for the uses for which nature 
intended feet.  She had spoiled them by wearing shoes 
to make them look smaller and slimmer than they were. 
In steady weather she was plaintive; in changeable 
weather she varied between irritable and violent. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0026" n="13"/>  
</p><p>Said Mildred to her brother:  "How much&mdash;<hi rend="italic">just</hi> 
how much is there?'' 
</p><p>"I can't say exactly,'' replied her brother, who had 
not yet solved to his satisfaction the moral problem of 
how much of the estate he ought to allow his mother 
and sister and how much he ought to claim for himself 
&mdash;in such a way that the claim could not be disputed. 
</p><p>Mildred looked fixedly at him.  He showed his uneasiness 
not by glancing away, but by the appearance of 
a certain hard defiance in his eyes.  Said she: 
</p><p>"What is the very most we can hope for?'' 
</p><p>A silence.  Her mother broke it.  "Mildred, how 
<hi rend="italic">can</hi> you talk of those things&mdash;already?'' 
</p><p>"I don't know,'' replied Mildred.  "Perhaps 
because it's got to be done.'' 
</p><p>This seemed to them all&mdash;and to herself&mdash;a lame 
excuse for such apparent hardness of heart.  Her 
father had always been <hi rend="italic">so</hi> tender-hearted&mdash;had never 
spoken of money, or encouraged his family in speaking of it. 
</p><p>A long and painful silence.  Then, the widow 
abruptly: 
</p><p>"You're <hi rend="italic">sure</hi>, Frank, there's <hi rend="italic">no</hi> insurance?'' 
</p><p>"Father always said that you disliked the idea,'' 
replied her son; "that you thought insurance looked 
like your calculating on his death.'' 
</p><p>Under her husband's adroit prompting Mrs. Gower 
had discovered such a view of insurance in her brain. 
She now recalled expressing it&mdash;and regretted.  But 
she was silenced.  She tried to take her mind of the sub-
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0027" n="14"/> 
ject of money.  But, like Mildred, she could not.  The 
thought of imminent poverty was nagging at them like 
toothache.  "There'll be enough for a year or so?'' 
she said, timidly interrogative. 
</p><p>"I hope so,'' said Frank. 
</p><p>Mildred was eying him fixedly again.  Said she: 
"Have you found anything at all?'' 
</p><p>"He had about eight thousand dollars in bank,'' 
said Frank.  "But most of it will go for the pressing 
debts.'' 
</p><p>"But how did <hi rend="italic">he</hi> expect to live?'' urged 
Mildred. 
</p><p>"Yes, there must have been <hi rend="italic">something</hi>,'' 
said her 
mother. 
</p><p>"Of course, there's his share of the unsettled and 
unfinished business of the firm,'' admitted Frank. 
</p><p>"How much will that be?'' persisted Mildred. 
</p><p>"I can't tell, offhand,'' said Frank, with virtuous 
reproach.  "My mind's been on&mdash;other things.'' 
</p><p>Henry Gower's widow was not without her share of 
instinctive shrewdness.  Neither had she, unobservant 
though she was, been within sight of her son's 
character for twenty-eight years without having 
unconfessed, unformed misgivings concerning it. 
"You mustn't bother about these things now, Frank 
dear,'' said she.  "I'll get my brother to look into 
it.'' 
</p><p>"That won't be necessary,'' hastily said Frank.  "I 
don't want any rival lawyer peeping into our firm's affairs.'' 
</p><p>"My brother Wharton is the soul of honor,'' said 
Mrs. Gower, the elder, with dignity.  "You are too 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0028" n="15"/>   
young to take all the responsibility of settling the 
estate.  Yes, I'll send for Wharton to-morrow.'' 
</p><p>"It'll look as though you didn't trust me,'' said 
Frank sourly. 
</p><p>"We mustn't do anything to start the gossips in 
this town,'' said his wife, assisting. 
</p><p>"Then send for him yourself, Frank,'' said Mildred, 
"and give him charge of the whole matter.'' 
</p><p>Frank eyed her furiously.  "How ashamed father 
would be!'' exclaimed he. 
</p><p>But this solemn invoking of the dead man's spirit 
was uneffectual.  The specter of poverty was too 
insistent, too terrible.  Said the widow: 
</p><p>"I'm sure, in the circumstances, my dear dead 
husband would want me to get help from someone older 
and more experienced.'' 
</p><p>And Frank, guilty of conscience and an expert in 
the ways of conventional and highly moral rascality, 
ceased to resist.  His wife, scenting danger to their 
getting the share that "rightfully belongs to the son, 
especially when he has been the brains of the firm for 
several years,'' made angry and indiscreet battle for no 
outside interference.  The longer she talked the firmer 
the widow and the daughter became, not only because 
she clarified suspicions that had been too hazy to 
take form, but also because they disliked her intensely. 
The following day Wharton Conover became unofficial 
administrator.  He had no difficulty in baffling 
Frank Gower's half-hearted and clumsy efforts to 
hide two large fees due the dead man's estate.  He 
discovered clear assets amounting in all to sixty-<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0029" n="16"/> 
three thousand dollars, most of it available within a few 
months. 
</p><p>"As you have the good-will of the firm and as your 
mother and sister have only what can be realized in 
cash,'' said he to Frank, "no doubt you won't insist 
on your third.'' 
</p><p>"I've got to consider my wife,'' said Frank.  "I 
can't do as I'd like.'' 
</p><p>"You are going to insist on your third?'' said 
Conover, with an accent that made Frank quiver. 
</p><p>"I can't do otherwise,'' said he in a dogged, shamed 
way. 
</p><p>"Um,'' said Conover.  "Then, on behalf of my 
sister and her daughter I'll have to insist on a more 
detailed accounting than you have been willing to give 
&mdash;and on the production of that small book bound in 
red leather which disappeared from my brother-in-law's 
desk the afternoon of his death.'' 
</p><p>A wave of rage and fear surged up within Frank 
Gower and crashed against the seat of his life.  For 
days thereafter he was from time to time seized with 
violent spasms of trembling; years afterward he was 
attributing premature weaknesses of old age to the 
effects of that moment of horror.  His uncle's words 
came as a sudden, high shot climax to weeks of 
exasperating peeping and prying and questioning, of 
sneer and insinuation.  Conover had been only moderately 
successful at the law, had lost clients to Frank's 
father, had been beaten when they were on opposite 
sides.  He hated the father with the secret, hypocritical 
hatred of the highly moral and religious man.  He de-
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0030" n="17"/>   
spised the son.  It is not often that a Christian gentleman 
has such an opportunity to combine justice and 
revenge, to feed to bursting an ancient grudge, the 
while conscious that he is but doing his duty. 
</p><p>Said Frank, when he was able to speak:  "You have 
been listening to the lies of some treacherous clerk 
here.'' 
</p><p>"Don't destroy that little book,'' proceeded Conover 
tranquilly.  "We can prove that you took it.'' 
</p><p>Young Gower rose.  "I must decline to have anything 
further to say to you, sir,'' said he.  "You will 
leave this office, and you will not be admitted here again 
unless you come with proper papers as administrator.'' 
</p><p>Conover smiled with cold satisfaction and departed. 
There followed a series of quarrels&mdash;between Frank 
and his sister, between Frank and his mother, between 
Frank's wife and his mother, between Mildred and her 
mother, between the mother and Conover.  Mrs. Gower 
was suspicious of her son; but she knew her brother 
for a pinchpenny, exacting the last drop of what he 
regarded as his own.  And she discovered that, if she 
authorized him to act as administrator for her, he could 
&mdash;and beyond question would&mdash;take a large share of 
the estate.  The upshot was that Frank paid over to 
his mother and sister forty-seven thousand dollars, and 
his mother and her brother stopped speaking to each 
other. 
</p><p>"I see that you have turned over all your money to 
mother,'' said Frank to Mildred a few days after the 
settlement. 
</p><p>"Of course,'' said Mildred.  She was in a mood of 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0031" n="18"/> 
high scorn for sordidness&mdash;a mood induced by the 
spectacle of the shameful manners of Conover, Frank, 
and his wife. 
</p><p>"Do you think that's wise?'' suggested Frank. 
</p><p>"I think it's decent,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"Well, I hope you'll not live to regret it,'' said her 
brother. 
</p><p>Neither Mrs. Gower nor her daughter had ever had 
any experience in the care of money.  To both forty-seven thousand dollars seemed a fortune&mdash;forty-seven 
thousand dollars in cash in the bank, ready to issue 
forth and do their bidding at the mere writing of a 
few figures and a signature on a piece of paper.  In 
a sense they knew that for many years the family's 
annual expenses had ranged between forty and fifty 
thousand, but in the sense of actuality they knew 
nothing about it&mdash;a state of affairs common enough 
in families where the man is in absolute control and 
spends all he makes.  Money always had been  
<orig>forthcomcoming</orig>; 
therefore money always would be forthcoming. 
</p><p>The mourning and the loss of the person who had 
filled and employed their lives caused the widow and 
the daughter to live very quietly during the succeeding 
year.  They spent only half of their capital.  For 
reasons of selfish and far-sighted prudence which need 
no detailing Frank moved away to New York within 
six months of his father's death and reduced communication 
between himself and wife and his mother and 
sister to a frigid and rapidly congealing minimum. 
He calculated that by the time their capital was con-
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0032" n="19"/>   
sumed they would have left no feeling of claim upon 
him or he feeling of duty toward them. 
</p><p>It was not until eighteen months after her father's 
death, when the total capital was sunk to less than 
fifteen thousand dollars, that Mildred awakened to the 
truth of their plight.  A few months at most, and 
they would have to give up that beautiful house which 
had been her home all her life.  She tried to grasp 
the meaning of the facts as her intelligence presented 
them to her, but she could not.  She had no practical 
training whatever.  She had been brought up as a rich 
man's child, to be married to a rich man, and never to 
know anything of the material details of life beyond 
what was necessary in managing servants after the 
indifferent fashion of the usual American woman of the 
comfortable classes.  She had always had a maid; she 
could not even dress herself properly without the maid's 
assistance.  Life without a maid was inconceivable; 
life without servants was impossible. 
</p><p>She wandered through the house, through the 
grounds.  She said to herself again and again:  "We 
have got to give up all this, and be miserably poor&mdash; 
with not a servant, with less than the tenement people 
have.''  But the words conveyed no meaning to her. 
She said to herself again and again:  "I must rouse 
myself.  I must do something.  I must&mdash;must&mdash; 
must!''  But she did not rouse, because there was nothing 
to rouse.  So far as practical life was concerned 
she was as devoid of ideas as a new-born baby. 
</p><p>There was but the one hope&mdash;marriage, a rich 
marriage.  It is the habit of men who can take care of 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0033" n="20"/>  
themselves and of women who are securely well taken 
care of to scorn the woman or the helpless-bred man 
who marries for money or even entertains that idea. 
How little imagination these scorners have!  To marry 
for a mere living, hardly better than one could make 
for oneself, assuredly does show a pitiful lack of self-reliance, a melancholy lack of self-respect.  But for 
men or women all their lives used to luxury and with 
no ability whatever at earning money&mdash;for such persons 
to marry money in order to save themselves from 
the misery and shame that poverty means to them is the 
most natural, the most human action conceivable.  The 
man or the woman who says he or she would not do it, 
either is a hypocrite or is talking without thinking. 
You may in honesty criticize and condemn a social system 
that suffers men and women to be so crudely and 
criminally miseducated by being given luxury they did 
not earn.  But to condemn the victims of that system 
for acting as its logic compels is sheer folly or sheer 
phariseeism. 
</p><p>Would Mildred Gower have married for money?  As 
the weeks fled, as the bank account dwindled, she would 
have grasped eagerly at any rich man who might have 
offered himself&mdash;no matter how repellent he might 
have been.  She did not want a bare living; she did not 
want what passes with the mass of middle-class people 
for comfort.  She wanted what she had&mdash;the beautiful 
and spacious house, the costly and fashionable clothing, 
the servants, the carriages and motors, the thousand 
and one comforts, luxuries, and vanities to which she 
had always been used.  In the brain of a young woman 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0034" n="21"/>
of poor or only comfortably off family the thoughts 
that seethed in Mildred Gower's brain would have been 
so many indications of depravity.  In Mildred Gower's 
brain they were the natural, the inevitable, thoughts. 
They indicated everything as to her training, nothing 
as to her character.  So, when she, thinking only of a 
rich marriage with no matter whom, and contrasting 
herself with the fine women portrayed in the novels and 
plays, condemned herself as shameless and degraded, 
she did herself grave injustice. 
</p><p>But no rich man, whether attractive or repulsive, 
offered.  Indeed, no man of any kind offered.  Instead, 
it was her mother who married. 
</p><p>A widower named James Presbury, elderly, with an 
income of five to six thousand a year from inherited 
wealth, stumbled into Hanging Rock to live, was 
impressed by the style the widow Gower maintained, 
believed the rumor that her husband had left her better 
off than was generally thought, proposed, and was 
accepted.  And two years and a month after Henry 
Gower's death his widow became Mrs. James Presbury 
&mdash;and ceased to veil from her new husband the truth 
as to her affairs. 
</p><p>Mildred had thought that, than the family quarrels 
incident to settling her father's estate, human nature 
could no lower descend.  She was now to be disillusioned. 
When a young man or a young woman blunders 
into a poor marriage in trying to make a rich 
one, he or she is usually withheld from immediate and 
frank expression by the timidity of youth.  Not so 
the elderly man or woman.  As we grow older, no mat-
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0035" n="22"/>  
ter how timidly conventional we are by nature, we 
become, through selfishness or through indifference to the 
opinion of others or through impatience of petty 
restraint, more and more outspoken.  Old Presbury 
discovered how he had tricked himself four days after the 
wedding.  He and his bride were at the Waldorf in 
New York, a-honeymooning. 
</p><p>The bride had never professed to be rich.  She had 
simply continued in her lifelong way, had simply acted 
rich.  She well knew the gaudy delusions her admirer 
was entertaining, and she saw to it that nothing was 
said or done to disturb him.  She inquired into his affairs, 
made sure of the substantiality of the comparatively 
small income he possessed, decided to accept him 
as her best available chance to escape becoming a 
charge upon her anything but eager and generous 
relatives.  She awaited the explosion with serenity. 
She cared not a flip for Presbury, who was a soft and 
silly old fool, full of antiquated compliments and so 
drearily the inferior of Henry Gower, physically and 
mentally, that even she could appreciate the difference, 
the descent.  She rather enjoyed the prospect of a 
combat with him, of the end of dissimulating her 
contempt.  She had thought out and had put in 
arsenal ready for use a variety of sneers, jeers, and 
insults that suggested themselves to her as she 
listened and simpered and responded while he was 
courting. 
</p><p>Had the opportunity offered earlier than the fourth 
day she would have seized it, but not until that fourth 
morning was she in just the right mood.  She had 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0036" n="28"/>   
eaten too much dinner the night before, and had 
followed it after two hours in a stuffy theater with an 
indigestible supper.  He liked the bedroom windows 
open at night; she liked them closed.  After she fell 
into a heavy sleep, he slipped out of bed and opened 
the windows wide&mdash;to teach her by the night's happy 
experience that she was entirely mistaken as to the 
harmfulness of fresh winter air.  The result was that 
she awakened with a frightful cold and a splitting 
headache.  And as the weather was about to change 
she had shooting pains like toothache through her 
toes the instant she thrust them into her shoes. 
The elderly groom, believing he had a rich bride, 
was all solicitude and infuriating attention.  She 
waited until he had wrought her to the proper pitch of 
fury.  Then she said&mdash;in reply to some remark of 
his: 
</p><p>"Yes, I shall rely upon you entirely.  I want you 
to take absolute charge of my affairs.'' 
</p><p>The tears sprang to his eyes.  His weak old mouth, 
rapidly falling to pieces, twisted and twitched with 
emotion.  "I'll try to deserve your confidence, 
darling,'' said he.  "I've had large business experience&mdash; 
in the way of investing carefully, I mean.  I don't 
think your affairs will suffer in my hands.'' 
</p><p>"Oh, I'm sure they'll not trouble you,'' said she in 
a sweet, sure tone as the pains shot through her feet 
and her head.  "You'll hardly notice my little mite in 
your property.''  She pretended to reflect.  "Let me 
see&mdash;there's seven thousand left, but of course half 
of that is Millie's.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0037" n="24"/>  
</p><p>"It must be very well invested,'' said he.  "Those 
seven thousand shares must be of the very best.'' 
</p><p>"Shares?'' said she, with a gentle little laugh.  "I 
mean dollars.'' 
</p><p>Presbury was about to lift a cup of <hi rend="italic">caf&eacute; au lait</hi> to 
his lips.  Instead, he turned it over into the platter of 
eggs and bacon. 
</p><p>"We&mdash;Mildred and I,'' pursued his bride, "were 
left with only forty-odd thousand between us.  Of 
course, we had to live.  So, naturally, there's very 
little left.'' 
</p><p>Presbury was shaking so violently that his head and 
arms waggled like a jumping-jack's.  He wrapped his 
elegant white fingers about the arms of his chair to 
steady himself.  In a suffocated voice he said:  "Do 
you mean to say that you have only seven thousand 
dollars in the world?'' 
</p><p>"Only half that,'' corrected she.  "Oh, dear, how 
my head aches!  Less than half that, for there are some 
debts.'' 
</p><p>She was impatient for the explosion; the agony of 
her feet and head needed outlet and relief.  But he 
disappointed her.  That was one of the situations in which 
one appeals in vain to the resources of language.  He 
shrank and sank back in his chair, his jaw dropped, 
and he vented a strange, imbecile cackling laugh.  It 
was not an expression of philosophic mirth, of sense 
of the grotesqueness of an anti-climax.  It was not an 
expression of any emotion whatever.  It was simply a 
signal from a mind temporarily dethroned. 
</p><p>"What are you laughing at?'' she said sharply. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0038" n="25"/>  
</p><p>His answer was a repetition of the idiotic sound. 
</p><p>"What's the matter with you?'' demanded she. 
"Please close your mouth.'' 
</p><p>It was a timely piece of advice; for his upper and 
false teeth had become partially dislodged and 
threatened to drop upon the shirt-bosom gayly showing  
between the lapels of his dark-blue silk house-coat.  He 
slowly closed his mouth, moving his teeth back into 
place with his tongue&mdash;a gesture that made her face 
twitch with rage and disgust. 
</p><p>"Seven thousand dollars,'' he mumbled dazedly. 
</p><p>"I said less than half that,'' retorted she sharply. 
</p><p>"And I&mdash;thought you were&mdash;rich.'' 
</p><p>A peculiar rolling of the eyes and twisting of the 
lips gave her the idea that he was about to vent that 
repulsive sound again.  "Don't you laugh!'' she cried. 
"I can't bear your laugh&mdash;even at its best.'' 
</p><p>Suddenly he galvanized into fury.  "This is an 
outrage!'' he cried, waving his useless-looking white fists. 
"You have swindled me&mdash;<hi rend="italic">swindled</hi> me!'' 
</p><p>Her head stopped aching.  The pains in her feet 
either ceased or she forgot them.  In a suspiciously 
calm voice she said:  "What do you mean?'' 
</p><p>"I mean that you are a swindler!'' he shouted, 
banging one fist on the table and waving the other. 
</p><p>She acted as though his meaning were just dawning 
upon her.  "Do you mean,'' said she tranquilly, "that 
you married me for money?'' 
</p><p>"I mean that I thought you a substantial woman, and 
that I find you are an adventuress.'' 
</p><p>"Did you think,'' inquired she, "that any woman 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0039" n="26"/> 
who had money would marry <hi rend="italic">you</hi>?'' She laughed 
very quietly.  "You <hi rend="italic">are</hi> a fool!'' 
</p><p>He sat back to look at her.  This mode of combat in 
such circumstances puzzled him. 
</p><p>"I knew that you were rich,'' she went on, "or you 
would not have dared offer yourself to me.  All my 
friends were amazed at my stooping to accept you. 
Your father was an Irish Tammany contractor, wasn't 
he?&mdash;a sort of criminal?  But I simply had to marry. 
So I gave you my family and position and name in 
exchange for your wealth&mdash;a good bargain for you, 
but a poor one for me.'' 
</p><p>These references to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> wealth were most 
disconcerting, 
especially as they were accompanied by remarks about 
his origin, of which he was so ashamed that he had 
changed the spelling of his name in the effort to clear 
himself of it.  However, some retort was imperative. 
He looked at her and said: 
</p><p>"Swindler and adventuress!'' 
</p><p>"Don't repeat that lie,'' said she.  "You are 
the adventurer&mdash;despite the fact that you are very 
rich.'' 
</p><p>"Don't say that again,'' cried he.  "I never said or 
pretended I was rich.  I have about five thousand a 
year&mdash;and you'll not get a cent of it, madam!'' 
</p><p>She knew his income, but no one would have suspected 
it from her expression of horror.  "What!'' she 
gasped.  "You dared to marry <hi rend="italic">me</hi> when you were a&mdash; 
beggar!  Me&mdash;the widow of Henry Gower!  You 
impudent old wreck!  Why, you haven't enough to pay 
my servants.  What are we to live on, pray?'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0040" n="27"/> 
</p><p>"I don't know what <hi rend="italic">you'll</hi> live on,'' 
replied he.  "<hi rend="italic">I</hi> 
shall live as I always have.'' 
</p><p>"A beggar!'' she exclaimed.  "I&mdash;married to a 
beggar.''  She burst into tears.  "How men take 
advantage of a woman alone!  If my son had been near 
me!  But there's surely some law to protect me.  Yes, 
I'm sure there is.  Oh, I'll punish you for having 
deceived me.''  Her eyes dried as she looked at him. 
"How dare you sit there?  How dare you face me, you 
miserable fraud!'' 
</p><p>Early in her acquaintance with him she had discovered 
that determining factors in his character were 
sensitiveness about his origin and sensitiveness about his 
social position.  On this knowledge of his weaknesses was 
securely based her confidence that she could act as she 
pleased toward him.  To ease her pains she proceeded 
to pour out her private opinion of him&mdash;all the 
disagreeable things, all the insults she had been storing 
up. 
</p><p>She watched him as only a woman can watch a man. 
She saw that his rage was not dangerous, that she was 
forcing him into a position where fear of her revenging 
herself by disgracing him would overcome anger at 
the collapse of his fatuous dreams of wealth.  She did 
not despise him the more deeply for sitting there, for 
not flying from the room or trying to kill her or somehow 
compelling her to check that flow of insult.  She 
already despised him utterly; also, she attached small 
importance to self-respect, having no knowledge of what 
that quality really is. 
</p><p>When she grew tired, she became quiet.  They sat 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0041" n="28"/> 
there a long time in silence.  At last he ran up the white 
flag of abject surrender by saying: 
</p><p>"What'll we live on&mdash;that's what I'd like to know?'' 
</p><p>An eavesdropper upon the preceding violence of 
upward of an hour would have assumed that at its end this 
pair must separate, never to see each other again 
voluntarily.  But that idea, even as a possibility, had not 
entered the mind of either.  They had lived a long time; 
they were practical people.  They knew from the outset 
that somehow they must arrange to go on together. 
The alternative meant a mere pittance of alimony for 
her; meant for him social ostracism and the small 
income cut in half; meant for both scandal and confusion. 
</p><p>Said she fretfully:  "Oh, I suppose we'll get along, 
somehow.  I don't know anything about those things. 
I've always been looked after&mdash;kept from contact with 
the sordid side of life.'' 
</p><p>"That house you live in,'' he went on, "does it 
belong to you?'' 
</p><p>She gave him a contemptuous glance.  "Of course,'' 
said she.  "What low people you must have been used 
to!'' 
</p><p>"I thought perhaps you had rented it for your 
bunco game,'' retorted he.  "The furniture, the horses, 
the motor&mdash;all those things&mdash;do they belong to 
you?'' 
</p><p>"I shall leave the room if you insult me,'' said she. 
</p><p>"Did you include them in the seven thousand dollars?'' 
</p><p>"The money is in the bank.  It has nothing to do 
with our house and our property.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0042" n="29"/>   
</p><p>He reflected, presently said:  "The horses and 
carriages must be sold at once&mdash;and all those servants 
dismissed except perhaps two.  We can live in the house.'' 
</p><p>She grew purple with rage.  "Sell <hi rend="italic">my</hi> 
carriages! 
Discharge <hi rend="italic">my</hi> servants!  I'd like to see you try!'' 
</p><p>"Who's to pay for keeping up that establishment?'' 
demanded he. 
</p><p>She was silent.  She saw what he had in mind. 
</p><p>"If you want to keep that house and live comfortably,'' 
he went on, "you've got to cut expenses to the 
bone.  You see that, don't you?'' 
</p><p>"I can't live any way but the way I've been used to 
all my life,'' wailed she. 
</p><p>He eyed her disgustedly.  Was there anything equal 
to a woman for folly? 
</p><p>"We've got to make the most of what little we 
have,'' said he. 
</p><p>"I tell you I don't know anything about those 
things,'' repeated she.  "You'll have to look after them. 
Mildred and I aren't like the women you've been used to. 
We are ladies.'' 
</p><p>Presbury's rage boiled over again at the mention of 
Mildred.  "That daughter of yours!'' he cried. 
"What's to be done about her?  I've got no money to 
waste on her.'' 
</p><p>"You miserable Tammany <hi rend="italic">thing!</hi>'' exclaimed 
she. 
"Don't you dare <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> of my daughter except in the 
most respectful way.'' 
</p><p>And once more she opened out upon him, wreaking 
upon him all her wrath against fate, all the pent-up 
fury of two years&mdash;fury which had been denied such 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0043" n="30"/>  
fury's usual and natural expression in denunciations of 
the dead bread-winner.  The generous and ever-kind 
Henry Gower could not be to blame for her wretched 
plight; and, of course, she herself could not be to blame 
for it.  So, until now there had been no scapegoat. 
Presbury therefore received the whole burden.  He, 
alarmed lest a creature apparently so irrational, should 
in wild rage drive him away, ruin him socially, perhaps 
induce a sympathetic court to award her a large part of 
his income as alimony, said not a word in reply.  He 
bade his wrath wait.  Later on, when the peril was over, 
when he had a firm grip upon the situation&mdash;then he 
would take his revenge. 
</p><p>They gave up the expensive suite at the Waldorf that 
very day and returned to Hanging Rock.  They alternated 
between silence and the coarsest, crudest quarrelings, 
for neither had the intelligence to quarrel wittily or the 
refinement to quarrel artistically.  As soon as they 
arrived at the Gower house, Mildred was dragged into the 
wrangle. 
</p><p>"I married this terrible man for your sake,'' was the 
burden of her mother's wail.  "And he is a beggar&mdash; 
wants to sell off everything and dismiss the servants.'' 
</p><p>"You are a pair of paupers,'' cried the old man. 
"You are shameless tricksters.  Be careful how you 
goad me!'' 
</p><p>Mildred had anticipated an unhappy ending to her 
mother's marriage, but she had not knowledge enough 
of life or of human nature to anticipate any such 
horrors as now began.  Every day, all day long the vulgar 
fight raged.  Her mother and her stepfather withdrew 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0044" n="31"/>  
from each other's presence only to think up fresh insults 
to fling at each other.  As soon as they were armed 
they hastened to give battle again.  She avoided 
Presbury.  Her mother she could not avoid; and when her 
mother was not in combat with him, she was weeping 
or wailing or railing to Mildred. 
</p><p>It was at Mildred's urging that her mother 
acquiesced in Presbury's plans for reducing expenses 
within income.  At first the girl, even more ignorant 
than her mother of practical affairs, did not appreciate 
the wisdom, not to say the necessity, of what he 
wished to do, but soon she saw that he was right, that 
the servants must go, that the horses and carriages and 
the motors must be sold.  When she was convinced 
and had convinced her mother, she still did not realize 
what the thing really meant.  Not until she no longer 
had a maid did she comprehend.  To a woman who has 
never had a maid, or who has taken on a maid as a 
luxury, it will seem an exaggeration to say that Mildred 
felt as helpless as a baby lying alone in a crib before it 
has learned to crawl.  Yet that is rather an understatement 
of her plight.  The maid left in the afternoon. 
Mildred, not without inconveniences that had in the 
novelty their amusing side, contrived to dress that 
evening for dinner and to get to bed; but when she awakened 
in the morning and was ready to dress, the loss of 
Therese became a tragedy.  It took the girl nearly four 
hours to get herself together presentably&mdash;and then, 
never had she looked so unkempt.  With her hair, thick 
and soft, she could do nothing. 
</p><p>"What a wonderful person Therese was!'' thought 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0045" n="32"/>  
she.  "And I always regarded her as rather stupid.'' 
Her mother, who had not had a maid until she was 
about thirty and had never become completely dependent, 
fared somewhat better, though, hearing her moans, 
you would have thought she was faring worse. 
</p><p>Mildred's unhappiness increased from day to day, as 
her wardrobe fell into confusion and disrepair.  She 
felt that she must rise to the situation, must teach 
herself, must save herself from impending dowdiness and 
slovenliness.  But her brain seemed to be paralyzed. 
She did not know how or where to begin to learn.  She 
often in secret gave way to the futility of tears. 
</p><p>There were now only a cook and one housemaid and 
a man of all work&mdash;all three newcomers, for Presbury 
insisted&mdash;most wisely&mdash;that none of the servants of 
the luxurious, wasteful days would be useful in the new 
circumstances.  He was one of those small, orderly men 
who have a genius for just such situations as the one 
he now proceeded to grapple with and solve.  In his 
pleasure at managing everything about that house, in 
distributing the work among the three servants, in 
marketing, and, in inspecting purchases and nosing into 
the garbage-barrel, in looking for dust on picture-frames and table-tops and for neglected weeds in the 
garden walks&mdash;in this multitude of engrossing delights 
he forgot his anger over the trick that had been 
played upon him.  He still fought with his wife and 
denounced her and met insult with insult.  But that, 
too, was one of his pleasures.  Also, he felt that on the 
whole he had done well in marrying.  He had been lonely 
as a bachelor, had had no one to talk with, or to quarrel 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0046" n="33"/> 
with, nothing to do.  The marriage was not so expensive, 
as his wife had brought him a house&mdash;and it such 
a one as he had always regarded as the apogee of 
elegance.  Living was not dear in Hanging Rock, if one 
understood managing and gave time to it.  And socially 
he was at last established. 
</p><p>Soon his wife was about as contented as she had ever 
been in her life.  She hated and despised her husband, 
but quarreling with him and railing against him gave 
her occupation and aim&mdash;two valuable assets toward 
happiness that she had theretofore lacked.  Her living 
&mdash;shelter, food, clothing enough&mdash;was now secure. 
But the most important factor of all in her content was 
the one apparently too trivial to be worthy of record. 
From girlhood she could not recall a single day in which 
she had not suffered from her feet.  And she had been 
ashamed to say anything about it&mdash;had never let anyone, 
even her maid, see her feet, which were about the 
only unsightly part of her.  None had guessed the 
cause of her chronic ill-temper until Presbury, that 
genius for the little, said within a week of their marriage: 
</p><p>"You talk and act like a woman with chronic corns.'' 
</p><p>He did not dream of the effect this chance thrust had 
upon his wife.  For the first time he had really 
"landed.''  She concealed her fright and her shame as 
best she could and went on quarreling more viciously 
than ever.  But he presently returned to the attack. 
Said he: 
</p><p>"Your feet hurt you.  I'm sure they do.  Now that 
I think of it, you walk that way.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0047" n="34"/> 
</p><p>"I suppose I deserve my fate,'' said she.  "When a 
woman marries beneath her she must expect insult and 
low conversation.'' 
</p><p>"You must cure your feet,'' said he.  "I'll not live 
in the house with a person who is made fiendish by corns. 
I think it's only corns.  I see no signs of bunions.'' 
</p><p>"You brute!'' cried his wife, rushing from the room. 
</p><p>But when they met again, he at once resumed the 
subject, telling her just how she could cure herself&mdash;and 
he kept on telling her, she apparently ignoring but 
secretly acting on his advice.  He knew what he was 
about, and her feet grew better, grew well&mdash;and she 
was happier than she had been since girlhood when she 
began ruining her feet with tight shoes. 
</p><p>Six months after the marriage, Presbury and his wife 
were getting on about as comfortably as it is given to 
average humanity to get on in this world of incessant 
struggle between uncomfortable man and his uncomfortable 
environment.  But Mildred had become more 
and more unhappy.  Her mother, sometimes angrily, 
again reproachfully&mdash;and that was far harder to bear 
&mdash;blamed her for "my miserable marriage to this low, 
quarrelsome brute.''  Presbury let no day pass without 
telling her openly that she was a beggar living off him, 
that she would better marry soon or he would take drastic 
steps to release himself of the burden.  When he attacked 
her before her mother, there was a violent quarrel 
from which Mildred fled to hide in her room or in the 
remotest part of the garden.  When he hunted her out 
to insult her alone, she sat or stood with eyes down and 
face ghastly pale, mute, quivering.  She did not inter-
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0048" n="35"/>  
rupt, did not try to escape.  She was like the chained 
and spiritless dog that crouches and takes the shower of 
blows from its cruel master. 
</p><p>Where could she go?  Nowhere.  What could she 
do?  Nothing.  In the days of prosperity she had 
regarded herself as proud and high spirited.  She now 
wondered at herself!  What had become of the pride? 
What of the spirit?  She avoided looking at her image 
in the glass&mdash;that thin, pallid face, those circled eyes, 
the drawn, sick expression about the mouth and nose. 
"I'm stunned,'' she said to herself.  "I've been stunned 
ever since father's death.  I've never recovered&mdash;nor 
has mother.''  And she gave way to tears&mdash;for her 
father, she fancied; in fact, from shame at her weakness 
and helplessness.  She thought&mdash;hoped&mdash;that she 
would not be thus feeble and cowardly, if she were not 
living at home, in the house she loved, the house where 
she had spent her whole life.  And such a house!  Comfort 
and luxury and taste; every room, every corner of 
the grounds, full of the tenderest and most beautiful 
associations.  Also, there was her position in Hanging 
Rock.  Everywhere else she would be a stranger and 
would have either no position at all or one worse than 
that of the utter outsider.  There, she was of the few 
looked up to by the whole community.  No one knew, 
or even suspected, how she was degraded by her step-father.  Before the world he was courteous and 
considerate toward her as toward everybody.  Indeed, 
Presbury's natural instincts were gentle and kindly.  His 
hatred of Mildred and his passion for humiliating her 
were the result of his conviction that he had been tricked 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0049" n="36"/> 
into the marriage and his inability to gratify his resentment 
upon his wife.  He could not make the mother 
suffer; but he could make the daughter suffer&mdash;and 
he did.  Besides, she was of no use to him and would 
presently be an expense. 
</p><p>"Your money will soon be gone,'' he said to her. 
"If you paid your just share of the expenses it would 
be gone now.  When it is gone, what will you do?'' 
</p><p>She was silent. 
</p><p>"Your mother has written to your brother about 
you.'' 
</p><p>Mildred lifted her head, a gleam of her former spirit 
in her eyes.  Then she remembered, and bent her gaze 
upon the ground. 
</p><p>"But he, like the cur that he is, answered through a 
secretary that he wished to have nothing to do with 
either of you.'' 
</p><p>Mildred guessed that Frank had made the marriage 
an excuse. 
</p><p>"Surely some of your relatives will do something for 
you.  I have my hands full, supporting your mother. 
I don't propose to have two strapping, worthless women 
hanging from my neck.'' 
</p><p>She bent her head lower, and remained silent. 
</p><p>"I warn you to bestir yourself,'' he went on.  "I 
give you four months.  After the first of the year you 
can't stay here unless you pay your share&mdash;your third.'' 
</p><p>No answer. 
</p><p>"You hear what I say, miss?'' he demanded. 
</p><p>"Yes,'' replied she. 
</p><p>"If you had any sense you wouldn't wait until your 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0050" n="37"/> 
last cent was gone.  You'd go to New York now and 
get something to do.'' 
</p><p>"What?'' she asked&mdash;all she could trust herself to 
speak. 
</p><p>"How should <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know?'' retorted he 
furiously. 
"you are a stranger to me.  You've been educated, I 
assume.  Surely there's something you can do.  You've 
been out six years now, and have had no success, for 
you're neither married nor engaged.  You can't call it 
success to be flattered and sought by people who wanted 
invitations to this house when it was a social center.'' 
</p><p>He paused for response from her.  None came. 
</p><p>"You admit you are a failure?'' he said sharply. 
</p><p>"Yes,'' said she. 
</p><p>"You must have realized it several years ago,'' he 
went on.  "Instead of allowing your mother to keep on 
wasting money in entertaining lavishly here to give 
you a chance to marry, you should have been preparing 
yourself to earn a living.''  A pause.  "Isn't that true, 
miss?'' 
</p><p>He had a way of pronouncing the word "miss'' that 
made it an epithet, a sneer at her unmarried and un-marriageable state.  She colored, paled, murmured: 
</p><p>"Yes.'' 
</p><p>"Then, better late than never.  You'll do well to 
follow my advice and go to New York and look about 
you.'' 
</p><p>"I'll&mdash;I'll think of it,'' stammered she. 
</p><p>And she did think of it.  But in all her life she had 
never considered the idea of money-making.  That was 
something for men, and for the middle and lower classes 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0051" n="38"/>  
&mdash;while Hanging Rock was regarded as most noisomely 
middle class by fashionable people, it did not so regard 
itself.  Money-making was not for ladies.  Like all her 
class, she was a constant and a severe critic of the 
women of the lower orders who worked for her as milliners, 
dressmakers, shop-attendants, cooks, maids.  But, as she 
now realized, it is one thing to pass upon the work 
of others; it is another thing to do work oneself. 
She&mdash;  There was literally nothing that she could do. 
Any occupation, even the most menial, was either 
beyond her skill or beyond her strength, or beyond 
both. 
</p><p>Suddenly she recalled that she could sing.  Her 
prostrate spirit suddenly leaped erect.  Yes, she could sing! 
Her voice had been praised by experts.  Her singing 
had been in demand at charity entertainments where 
amateurs had to compete with professionals.  Then 
down she dropped again.  She sang well enough to 
know how badly she sang&mdash;the long and toilsome and 
expensive training that lay between her and operatic or 
concert or even music-hall stage.  Her voice was fine at 
times.  Again&mdash;most of the time&mdash;it was unreliable. 
No, she could not hope to get paying employment even 
as a church choir-singer.  Miss Dresser who sang in the 
choir of the Good Shepherd for ten dollars a Sunday, 
had not nearly so good a voice as she, but it was reliable. 
</p><p>"There is nothing I can do&mdash;nothing!'' 
</p><p>All at once, with no apparent bridge across the vast 
chasm, her heart went out, not in pity but in human 
understanding and sisterly sympathy, to the women of the 
pariah class at whom, during her stops in New York, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0052" n="39"/> 
she had sometimes gazed in wonder and horror.  "Why, 
we and they are only a step apart,'' she said to herself in 
amazement.  "We and they are much nearer than my 
maid or the cook and they!'' 
</p><p>And then her heart skipped a beat and her skin grew 
cold and a fog swirled over her brain.  If she should be 
cast out&mdash;if she could find no work and no one to support 
her&mdash;would she&mdash;  "O my God!'' she moaned. 
"I must be crazy, to think such thoughts.  I never 
could!  I'd die first&mdash;<hi rend="italic">die!</hi>''  But if anyone had 
pictured 
to her the kind of life she was now leading&mdash;the 
humiliation and degradation she was meekly enduring 
with no thought of flight, with an ever stronger desire 
to stay on, regardless of pride and self-respect&mdash;if 
anyone had pictured this to her as what she would 
endure, what would she have said?  She could see herself 
flashing scornful denial, saying that she would rather 
kill herself.  Yet she was living&mdash;and was not even 
contemplating suicide as a way out! 
</p><p>A few days after Presbury gave her warning, her 
mother took advantage of his absence for his religiously 
observed daily constitutional to say to her: 
</p><p>"I hope you didn't think I was behind him in what 
he said to you about going away?'' 
</p><p>Mildred had not thought so, but in her mother's 
guilty tone and guiltier eyes she now read that her 
mother wished her to go. 
</p><p>"It'd be awful for me to be left here alone with him,'' 
wailed her mother insincerely.  "Of course we've got 
no money, and beggars can't be choosers.  But it'd just 
about kill me to have you go.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0053" n="40"/> 
</p><p>Mildred could not speak. 
</p><p>"I don't know a thing about money,'' Mrs. Presbury 
went on.  "Your father always looked after everything.'' 
She had fallen into the way of speaking of 
her first husband as part of some vague, remote past, 
which, indeed, he had become for her.  "This man''&mdash; 
meaning Presbury&mdash;"has only about five thousand a 
year, as you know.  I suppose that's as small as he says 
it is.  I remember our bills for one month used to be as 
much or more than that.''  She waved her useless, pretty 
hands helplessly.  "I don't see <hi rend="italic">how</hi> we are to get 
on, 
Mildred!'' 
</p><p>Her mother wished her to go!  Her mother had fallen 
under the influence of Presbury&mdash;her mother, woman-like, or rather, ladylike, was of kin to the helpless, flabby 
things that float in the sea and attach themselves to 
whatever they happen to lodge against.  Her mother 
wished her to go! 
</p><p>"At the same time,'' Mrs. Presbury went on, "I 
can't live without somebody here to stand between me 
and him.  I'd kill him or kill myself.'' 
</p><p>Mildred muttered some excuse and fled from the 
room, to lock herself in. 
</p><p>But when she came forth again to descend to dinner, 
she had resolved nothing, because there was nothing to 
resolve.  When she was a child she leaned from the 
nursery window one day and saw a stable-boy drowning 
a rat that was in a big, oval, wire cage with a wooden 
bottom.  The boy pressed the cage slowly down in the vat 
of water.  The rat, in the very top of the cage, watched 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0054" n="41"/> 
the floor sink, watched the water rise.  And as it watched 
it uttered a strange, shrill, feeble sound which she could 
still remember distinctly and terribly.  It seemed to her 
now that if she were to utter any sound at all, it would 
be that one.</p>

<head>II </head>

<p>ON the Monday before Thanksgiving, Presbury went 
up to New York to look after one of the little 
speculations in Wall Street at which he was so clever. 
Throughout the civilized world nowadays, and especially 
in and near the great capitals of finance, there is a class 
of men and women of small capital and of a character 
in which are combined iron self-restraint, rabbit-like 
timidity, and great shrewdness, who make often a not 
inconsiderable income by gambling in stocks.  They 
buy only when the market is advancing strongly; they 
sell as soon as they have gained the scantest margin of 
profit.  They never permit themselves to be tempted by 
the most absolute certainty of larger gains.  They will 
let weeks, months even, go by without once risking a 
dollar.  They wait until they simply cannot lose.  Tens 
of thousands every year try to join this class.  All but 
the few soon succumb to the hourly dazzling temptations 
the big gamblers dangle before the eyes of the little 
gamblers to lure them within reach of the merciless 
shears. 
</p><p>Presbury had for many years added from one to ten 
thousand a year to his income by this form of gambling, 
success at which is in itself sufficient to stamp a man as 
infinitely little of soul.  On that Monday he, venturing 
for the first time in six months, returned to Hanging 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0056" n="43"/>  
Rock on the three-thirty train the richer by two hundred 
and fifty dollars&mdash;as large a "killing'' as he had ever 
made in any single day, one large enough to elevate him 
to the rank of prince among the "sure-thing snides.'' 
He said nothing about his luck to his family, but let 
them attribute his unprecedented good humor to the 
news he brought and announced at dinner. 
</p><p>"I met an old friend in the street this afternoon,'' 
said he.  "He has invited us to take Thanksgiving dinner 
with him.  And I think it will be a dinner worth 
while&mdash;the food, I mean, and the wine.  Not the 
guests; for there won't be any guests but us.  General 
Siddall is a stranger in New York.'' 
</p><p>"There are Siddalls in New York,'' said his wife; 
"very nice, refined people&mdash;going in the best society.'' 
</p><p>Presbury showed his false teeth in a genial smile; for 
the old-fashioned or plate kind of false teeth they were 
extraordinarily good&mdash;when exactly in place.  "But 
not my old friend Bill Siddall,'' said he.  "He's next 
door to an outlaw.  I'd not have accepted his invitation 
if he had been asking us to dine in public.  But this 
is to be at his own house&mdash;his new house&mdash;and a very 
grand house it is, judging by the photos he showed me. 
A regular palace!  He'll not be an outlaw long, I guess. 
But we must wait and see how he comes out socially 
before we commit ourselves.'' 
</p><p>"Did you accept for me, too?'' asked Mrs. Presbury. 
</p><p>"Certainly,'' said Presbury.  "And for your daughter, 
too.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0057" n="44"/> 
</p><p>"I can't go,'' said Mildred.  "I'm dining with the 
Fassetts.'' 
</p><p>The family no longer had a servant in constant 
attendance in the dining-room.  The maid of many functions 
also acted as butler and as fetch-and-carry between 
kitchen and butler's pantry.  Before speaking, 
Presbury waited until this maid had withdrawn to bring 
the roast and the vegetables.  Then he said: 
</p><p>"You are going, too, miss.''  This with the full 
infusion of insult into the "miss.'' 
</p><p>Mildred was silent. 
</p><p>"Bill Siddall is looking for a wife,'' proceeded 
Presbury.  "And he has Heaven knows how many 
millions.'' 
</p><p>"Do you think there's a chance for Milly?'' cried 
Mrs. Presbury, who was full of alternating hopes and 
fears, both wholly irrational. 
</p><p>"She can have him&mdash;if she wants him,'' replied 
Presbury.  "But it's only fair to warn her that he's a 
stiff dose.'' 
</p><p>"Is the money&mdash;<hi rend="italic">certain</hi>?'' inquired 
Mildred's 
mother with that shrewdness whose rare occasional 
displays laid her open to the unjust suspicion of feigning 
her habitual stupidity. 
</p><p>"Yes,'' said Presbury amiably.  "It's nothing like 
yours was.  He's so rich he doesn't know what to do 
with his income.  He owns mines scattered all over the 
world.  And if they all failed, he's got bundles of railway 
stocks and bonds, and gilt-edged trust stocks, too. 
And he's a comparatively young man&mdash;hardly fifty, 
I should say.  He pretends to be forty.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0058" n="45"/>  
</p><p>"It's strange I never heard of him,'' said Mrs. Presbury. 
</p><p>"If you went to South America or South Africa or 
Alaska, you'd hear of him,'' said Presbury.  He laughed. 
"And I guess you'd hear some pretty dreadful things. 
When I knew him twenty-five years ago he had just 
been arrested for forging my father's name to a check. 
But he got out of that&mdash;and it's all past and gone. 
Probably he hasn't committed any worse crimes than 
have most of our big rich men.  Bill's handicap has 
been that he hadn't much education or any swell 
relatives.  But he's a genius at money-making.'' 
Presbury looked at Mildred with a grin.  "And he's just the 
husband for Mildred.  She can't afford to be too 
particular.  Somebody's got to support her.  <hi rend="italic">I</hi> 
can't and 
won't, and she can't support herself.'' 
</p><p>"You'll go&mdash;won't you, Mildred?'' said her mother. 
"He may not be so bad.'' 
</p><p>"Yes, I'll go,'' said Mildred.  Her gaze was upon the 
untouched food on her plate. 
</p><p>"Of course she'll go,'' said Presbury.  "And she'll 
marry him if she can.  Won't you, miss?'' 
</p><p>He spoke in his amiably insulting way&mdash;as distinguished 
from the way of savagely sneering insult he 
usually took with her.  He expected no reply.  She 
surprised him.  She lifted her tragic eyes and looked 
fixedly at him.  She said: 
</p><p>"Yes, I'll go.  And I'll marry him if I can.'' 
</p><p>"I told him he could have you,'' said Presbury.  "I 
explained to him that you were a rare specimen of the 
perfect lady&mdash;just what he wanted&mdash;and that you, 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0059" n="46"/> 
and all your family, would be grateful to anybody who 
would undertake your support.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Presbury flushed angrily.  "You've made it 
perfectly useless for her to go!'' she cried. 
</p><p>"Calm yourself, my love,'' said her husband.  "I 
know Bill Siddall thoroughly.  I said what would help. 
I want to get rid of her as much as you do&mdash;and that's 
saying a great deal.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Presbury flamed with the wrath of those who 
are justly accused.  "If Mildred left, I should go, too,'' 
cried she. 
</p><p>"Go where?'' inquired her husband.  "To the 
poorhouse?'' 
</p><p>By persistent rubbing in Presbury had succeeded in 
making the truth about her poverty and dependence 
clear to his wife.  She continued to frown and to 
look unutterable contempt, but he had silenced her. 
He noted this with a sort of satisfaction and went 
on: 
</p><p>"If Bill Siddall takes her, you certainly won't go 
there.  He wouldn't have you.  He feels strongly on 
the subject of mothers-in-law.'' 
</p><p>"Has he been married before?'' asked Mrs. Presbury. 
</p><p>"Twice,'' replied her husband.  "His first wife died. 
He divorced the second for unfaithfulness.'' 
</p><p>Mildred saw in this painstaking recital of all the 
disagreeable and repellent facts about Siddall an effort 
further to humiliate her by making it apparent how 
desperately off she was, how she could not refuse any 
offer, revolting though it might be to her pride and to 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0060" n="47"/>  
her womanly instincts.  Doubtless this was in part the 
explanation of Presbury's malicious candor.  But an 
element in that candor was a prudent preparing of the 
girl's mind for worse than the reality.  That he was in 
earnest in his profession of a desire to bring about the 
match showed when he proposed that they should take 
rooms at a hotel in New York, to give her a chance to 
dress properly for the dinner.  True, he hastened to say 
that the expense must be met altogether out of the 
remnant of Mildred's share of her father's estate, but 
the idea would not have occurred to him had he not 
been really planning a marriage. 
</p><p>Never had Mildred looked more beautiful or more 
attractive than when the three were ready to sally forth 
from the Manhattan Hotel on that Thanksgiving evening. 
At twenty-five, a soundly healthy and vigorous 
twenty-five, it is impossible for mind and nerves, 
however wrought upon, to make serious inroads upon 
surface charms.  The hope of emancipation from her hideous 
slavery had been acting upon the girl like a powerful 
tonic.  She had gained several pounds in the three 
intervening days; her face had filled out, color had come 
back in all its former beauty to her lips.  Perhaps 
there was some slight aid from art in the extraordinary 
brilliancy of her eyes. 
</p><p>Presbury inventoried her with a succession of grunts 
of satisfaction.  "Yes, he'll want you,'' he said. 
"You'll strike him as just the show piece he needs. 
And he's too shrewd not to be aware that his choice is 
limited.'' 
</p><p>"You can't frighten me,'' said Mildred, with a 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0061" n="48"/> 
radiant, coquettish smile&mdash;for practice.  "Nothing 
could frighten me.'' 
</p><p>"I'm not trying,'' replied Presbury.  "Nor will 
Siddall frighten you.  A woman who's after a bill-payer 
can stomach anything.'' 
</p><p>"Or a man,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"Oh, your mother wasn't as bad as all that,'' said 
Presbury, who never lost an opportunity. 
</p><p>Mrs. Presbury, seated beside her daughter in the cab, 
gave an exclamation of rage.  "My own daughter 
insulting me!'' she said. 
</p><p>"Such a thought did not enter my head,'' protested 
Mildred.  "I wasn't thinking of anyone in particular.'' 
</p><p>"Let's not quarrel now,'' said Presbury, with 
unprecedented amiability.  "We must give Bill a spectacle 
of the happy family.'' 
</p><p>The cab entered the porte-coch&egrave;re of a huge palace 
of white stone just off Fifth Avenue.  The house was 
even grander than they had anticipated.  The wrought-iron fence around it had cost a small fortune; the house 
itself, without reference to its contents, a large fortune. 
The massive outer doors were opened by two lackeys 
in cherry-colored silk and velvet livery; a butler, looking 
like an English gentleman, was waiting to receive 
them at the top of a short flight of marble steps 
between the outer and the inner entrance doors.  As 
Mildred ascended, she happened to note the sculpturing 
over the inner entrance&mdash;a reclining nude figure of a 
woman, Cupids with garlands and hymeneal torches 
hovering about her. 
</p><p>Mildred had been in many pretentious houses in and 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0062" n="49"/> 
near New York, but this far surpassed the grandest of 
them.  Everything was brand new, seemed to have been 
only that moment placed, and was of the costliest-statuary, carpets, armor, carved seats of stone and 
wood, marble staircase rising majestically, tapestries, 
pictures, drawing-room furniture.  The hall was vast, 
but the drawing-room was vaster.  Empty, one would 
have said that it could not possibly be furnished.  Yet 
it was not only full, but crowded-chairs and sofas, 
hassocks and t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes, cabinets, tables, pictures, 
statues, busts, palms, flowers, a mighty fireplace in 
which, behind enormous and costly andirons, crackled 
enormous and costly logs.  There was danger in moving 
about; one could not be sure of not upsetting something, 
and one felt that the least damage that could be 
done there would be an appallingly expensive matter. 
</p><p>Before that cavernous fireplace posed General 
Siddall.  He was a tiny mite of a man with a thin wiry 
body supporting the head of a professional barber. 
His black hair was glossy and most romantically 
arranged.  His black mustache and imperial were waxed 
and brilliantined.  There was no mistaking the liberal 
use of dye, also.  From the rather thin, very sharp 
face looked a pair of small, muddy, brown-green eyes 
&mdash;dull, crafty, cold, cruel.  But the little man was so 
insignificant and so bebarbered and betailored that one 
could not take him seriously.  Never had there been so 
new, so carefully pressed, so perfectly fitting evening 
clothes; never a shirt so expensively got together, or 
jeweled studs, waistcoat buttons and links so high 
priced.  From every part of the room, from every part 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0063" n="50"/>  
of the little man's perfumed and groomed person, every 
individual article seemed to be shrieking, "The best is 
not too good for Bill Siddall!'' 
</p><p>Mildred was agreeably surprised&mdash;she was looking 
with fierce determination for agreeable surprises&mdash; 
when the costly little man spoke, in a quiet, pleasant 
voice with an elusive, attractive foreign accent. 
</p><p>"My, but this is grand&mdash;grand, General Siddall!'' 
said Presbury in the voice of the noisy flatterer. 
"Princely!  Royal!'' 
</p><p>Mildred glanced nervously at Siddall.  She feared 
that Presbury had taken the wrong tone.  She saw in 
the unpleasant eyes a glance of gratified vanity.  Said 
he: 
</p><p>"Not so bad, not so bad.  I saw the house in Paris, 
when I was taking a walk one day.  I went to the 
American ambassador and asked for the best architect 
in Paris.  I went to him, told him about the house&mdash; 
and here it is.'' 
</p><p>"Decorations, furniture, and all!'' exclaimed Presbury. 
</p><p>"No, just the house.  I picked up the interiors in 
different parts of Europe&mdash;had everything reproduced 
where I couldn't buy outright.  I want to enjoy my 
money while I'm still young.  I didn't care what it cost 
to get the proper surroundings.  As I said to my architect 
and to my staff of artists, I expected to be cheated, 
but I wanted the goods.  And I got the goods.  I'll 
show you through the house after dinner.  It's on this 
same scale throughout.  And they're putting me together 
a country place&mdash;same sort of thing.''  He 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0064" n="51"/>  
threw back his little shoulders and protruded his little 
chest.  "And the joke of it is that the whole business 
isn't costing me a cent.'' 
</p><p>"Not a cent less than half a dozen or a dozen 
millions,'' said Presbury. 
</p><p>"Not so much as that&mdash;not quite,'' protested the 
delightedly sparkling little general.  "But what I 
meant was that, as fast as these fellows spend, I go 
down-town and make.  Fact is, I'm a little better off 
than I was when I started in to build.'' 
</p><p>"Well, you didn't get any of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> money,'' 
laughed 
Presbury.  "But I suppose pretty much everybody 
else in the country must have contributed.'' 
</p><p>General Siddall smiled.  Mildred wondered whether 
the points of his mustache and imperial would crack 
and break of, if he should touch them.  She noted that 
his hair was roached absurdly high above the middle 
of his forehead and that he was wearing the tallest heels 
she had ever seen.  She calculated that, with his hair 
flat and his feet on the ground, he would hardly come 
to her shoulder&mdash;and she was barely of woman's 
medium height.  She caught sight of his hands&mdash;the 
square, stubby hands of a working man; the fingers 
permanently slightly curved as by the handle of shovel 
and pick; the skin shriveled but white with a ghastly, 
sickening bleached white, the nails repulsively manicured 
into long white curves.  "If he should touch 
me, I'd scream,'' she thought.  And then she looked at 
Presbury&mdash;and around her at the evidences of enormous wealth. 
</p><p>The general&mdash;she wondered where he had got that 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0065" n="52"/>  
title&mdash;led her mother in to dinner, Presbury gave her 
his arm.  On the way he found opportunity to mutter: 
</p><p>"Lay it on thick!  Flatter the fool.  You can't 
offend him.  Tell him he's divinely handsome&mdash;a Louis 
Fourteen, a Napoleon.  Praise everything&mdash;napkins, 
tablecloth, dishes, food.  Rave over the wine.'' 
</p><p>But Mildred could not adopt this obviously excellent 
advice.  She sat silent and cold, while Presbury and 
her mother raved and drew out the general to talk of 
himself&mdash;the only subject in the whole world that 
seemed to him thoroughly worth while.  As Mildred 
listened and furtively observed, it seemed to her that 
this tiny fool, so obviously pleased by these coarse and 
insulting flatteries, could not possibly have had the 
brains to amass the vast fortune he apparently 
possessed.  But presently she noted that behind the 
personality that was pleased by this gross fawning and 
bootlicking there lay&mdash;lay in wait and on guard&mdash; 
another personality, one that despised these guests of 
his, estimating them at their true value and using them 
contemptuously for the gratification of his coarse 
appetites.  In the glimpse she caught of that deeper and 
real personality, she liked it even less than she liked 
the one upon the surface. 
</p><p>It was evidence of superior acumen that she saw even 
vaguely the real Bill Siddall, the money-maker, beneath 
the General William Siddall, raw and ignorant and 
vulgar&mdash;more vulgar in his refinement than the most 
shocking bum at home and at ease in foul-smelling stew. 
Every man of achievement hides beneath his surface&mdash; 
personality this second and real man, who makes the 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0066" n="53"/>  
fortune, discovers the secret of chemistry, fights the 
battle, carries the election, paints the picture, commits 
the frightful murder, evolves the divine sermon or poem 
or symphony.  Thus, when we meet a man of achievement, 
we invariably have a sense of disappointment. 
"Why, that's not the man!'' we exclaim.  "There 
must be some mistake.''  And it is, indeed, not the man. 
Him we are incapable of seeing.  We have only eyes 
for surfaces; and, not being doers of extraordinary 
deeds, but mere plodders in the routines of existence, 
we cannot believe that there is any more to another than 
there is to ourselves.  The pleasant or unpleasant 
surface for the conventional relations of life is about all 
there is to us; therefore it is all there is to human 
nature.  Well, there's no help for it.  In measuring our 
fellow beings we can use only the measurements of our 
own selves; we have no others, and if others are given to 
us we are as foozled as one knowing only feet and 
inches who has a tape marked off in meters and centimeters. 
</p><p>It so happened that in her social excursions Mildred 
had never been in any of the numerous homes of the 
suddenly and vastly rich of humble origin.  She was 
used to&mdash;and regarded as proper and elegant&mdash;the 
ordinary ostentations and crudities of the rich of 
conventional society.  No more than you or I was she 
moved to ridicule or disdain by the silliness and the 
tawdry vulgarity of the life of palace and liveried 
lackey and empty ceremonial, by the tedious entertainments, 
by the displays of costly and poisonous food. 
But General Siddall's establishment presented a new 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0067" n="54"/>  
phase to her&mdash;and she thought it unique in dreadfulness 
and absurdity. 
</p><p>The general had had a home life in his youth&mdash;in a 
coal-miner's cabin near Wilkes-Barre.  Ever since, he 
had lived in boarding-houses or hotels.  As his shrewd 
and rapacious mind had gathered in more and more 
wealth, he had lived more and more luxuriously&mdash;but 
always at hotels.  He had seen little of the private life 
of the rich.  Thus he had been compelled to get his 
ideas of luxury and of ceremonial altogether from the 
hotel-keepers and caterers who give the rich what the 
more intelligent and informed of the rich are usually 
shamed by people of taste from giving themselves at 
home. 
</p><p>She thought the tablecloth, napkins, and gaudy gold 
and flowery cut glass a little overdone, but on the whole 
not so bad.  She had seen such almost as grand at a 
few New York houses.  The lace in the cloth and in 
the napkins was merely a little too magnificent.  It 
made the table lumpy, it made the napkins unfit for use. 
But the way the dinner was served!  You would have 
said you were in a glorified palace-hotel restaurant. 
You looked about for the cashier's desk; you were certain 
a bill would be presented after the last course. 
</p><p>The general, tinier and more grotesque than ever in 
the great high-backed, richly carved armchair, surveyed 
the progress of the banquet with the air of a god 
performing miracles of creation and passing them in 
review and giving them his divine endorsement.  He was 
well pleased with the enthusiastic praises Presbury and 
his wife lavished upon the food and drink.  He would 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0068" n="55"/>  
have been better pleased had they preceded and followed 
every mouthful with a eulogy.  He supplemented their 
compliments with even more fulsome compliments, adding 
details as to the origin and the cost. 
</p><p>"Darcy''&mdash;this to the butler&mdash;"tell the chef that 
this fish is the best yet&mdash;really exquisite.''  To 
Presbury:  "I had it brought over from France&mdash;alive, 
of course.  We have many excellent fish, but I like a 
change now and then.  So I have a standing order with 
Prunier&mdash;he's the big oyster-and fish-man of Paris&mdash; 
to send me over some things every two weeks by special 
express.  That way, an oyster costs about fifty cents 
and a fish about five or six dollars.'' 
</p><p>To Mrs. Presbury:  "I'll have Darcy make you and 
Miss Presbury&mdash;excuse me, Miss Gower&mdash;bouquets 
of the flowers afterward.  Most of them come from 
New York&mdash;and very high really first-class flowers are. 
I pay two dollars apiece for my roses even at this 
season.  And orchids&mdash;well, I feel really extravagant 
when I indulge in orchids as I have this evening.  Ten 
dollars apiece for those.  But they're worth it.'' 
</p><p>The dinner was interminably long&mdash;upward of 
twenty kinds of food, no less than five kinds of wine; 
enough served and spoiled to have fed and intoxicated a 
dozen people at least.  And upon every item of food 
and drink the general had some remarks to make.  He 
impressed it upon his guests that this dinner was very 
little better than the one served to him every night, that 
the increase in expense and luxury was not in their 
honor, but in his own&mdash;to show them what he could 
do when he wished to make a holiday.  Finally the 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0069" n="56"/> 
grand course was reached.  Into the dining-room, to 
the amazement of the guests, were rolled two great 
restaurant joint wagons.  Instead of being made of 
silver-plated nickel or plain nickel they were of silver 
embossed with gold, and the large carvers and serving-spoons and forks had gold-mounted silver handles. 
When the lackeys turned back the covers there were 
disclosed several truly wonderful young turkeys, fattened 
as if by painstaking and skillful hand and superbly 
browned. 
</p><p>Up to that time the rich and costly food had been 
sadly medium&mdash;like the wines.  But these turkeys were 
a genuine triumph.  Even Mildred gave them a look of 
interest and admiration.  In a voice that made General 
Siddall ecstatic Presbury cried: 
</p><p>"<hi rend="italic">God</hi> bless my soul!  <hi rend="italic">Where</hi> did you get those 
beauties, old man!'' 
</p><p>"Paris,'' said Siddall in a voice tremulous with pride 
and self-admiration.  You would have thought that he 
had created not merely the turkeys, but Paris, also. 
"Potin sends them over to me.  Potin, you know, is the 
finest dealer in groceries, fruit, game, and so on in the 
world.  I have a standing order with him for the best of&mdash; 
everything that comes in.  I'd hate to tell you what my 
bill with Potin is every month&mdash;he only sends it to me 
once a year.  Really, I think I ought to be ashamed of 
myself, but I reason that, if a man can afford it, he's 
a fool to put anything but the best into his stomach.'' 
</p><p>"You're right there!'' mumbled Presbury.  His 
mouth was full of turkey.  "You <hi rend="italic">have</hi> got a chef, 
General!''  
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0070" n="57"/>
</p><p>"He ought to cook well.  I pay him more than most 
bank-presidents get.  What do you think of those joint 
wagons, Mrs. Presbury?'' 
</p><p>"They're very&mdash;interesting,'' replied she, a little 
nervous because she suspected they were some sort of 
vulgar joke. 
</p><p>"I knew you'd like them,'' said the general.  "My 
own idea entirely.  I saw them in several restaurants 
abroad&mdash;only of course those they had were just ordinary 
affairs, not fit to be introduced into a gentleman's 
dining-room.  But I took the idea and adapted it to my 
purposes&mdash;and there you are!'' 
</p><p>"Very original, old man,'' said Presbury, who had 
been drinking too much.  "I've never seen it before, 
and I don't think I ever shall again.  Got the idea 
patented?'' 
</p><p>But Siddall in his soberest moment would have been 
slow to admit a suspicion that any of the human race, 
which he regarded as on its knees before him, was 
venturing to poke fun at him.  Drunk as he now was, the 
openest sarcasm would have been accepted as a compliment. 
After a gorgeous dessert which nobody more 
than touched&mdash;a molded mousse of whipped and frozen 
cream and strawberries&mdash;"specially sent on to me from 
Florida and costing me a dollar apiece, I guess''&mdash;after 
this costly wonder had disappeared fruit was served. 
General Siddall had ready a long oration upon this 
course.  He delivered it in a disgustingly thick tone. 
The pineapple was an English hothouse product, the 
grapes were grown by a costly process under glass in 
Belgium.  As for the peaches, Potin had sent those deli-
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0071" n="58"/> 
cately blushing marvels, and the charge for this would 
be "not less than a louis apiece, sir&mdash;a louis d'or 
&mdash;which, as you no doubt know, is about four dollars 
of Uncle Sam's money.'' 
</p><p>The coffee&mdash;"the Queen of Holland may have it on 
her <hi rend="italic">private</hi> table&mdash;<hi rend="italic">may</hi>, 
I say&mdash;but I doubt if anyone 
else in the world gets a smell of it except me''&mdash; 
the coffee and the brandy came not a moment too soon. 
Presbury was becoming stupefied with indigestion; his 
wife was nodding and was wearing that vague, forced, 
pleasant smile which stands propriety-guard over a 
mind asleep; Mildred Gower felt that her nerves would 
endure no more; and the general was falling into a 
besotted state, spilling his wine, mumbling his words. 
The coffee and the brandy revived them all somewhat. 
Mildred, lifting her eyes, saw by way of a mirrored 
section of the enormous sideboard the English butler 
surveying master and guests with slowly moving, sneering 
glance of ineffable contempt. 
</p><p>In the drawing-room again Mildred, requested by 
Siddall and ordered by Presbury, sang a little French 
song and then&mdash;at the urging of Siddall&mdash;"Annie 
Laurie.''  Siddall was wiping his eyes when she turned 
around.  He said to Presbury: 
</p><p>"Take your wife into the conservatory to look at my 
orchids.  I want to say a word to your stepdaughter.'' 
</p><p>Mildred started up nervously.  She saw how drunk 
the general was, saw the expression of his face that a 
woman has to be innocent indeed not to understand. 
She was afraid to be left alone with him.  Presbury 
came up to her, said rapidly, in a low tone: 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0072" n="59"/> 
</p><p>"It's all right.  He's got a high sense of what's due 
a respectable woman of our class.  He isn't as drunk 
as he looks and acts.'' 
</p><p>Having said which, he took his wife by the arm and 
pushed her into the adjoining conservatory.  Mildred 
reseated herself upon the inlaid piano-bench.  The little 
man, his face now shiny with the sweat of drink and 
emotion, drew up a chair in front of her.  He sat&mdash; 
and he was almost as tall sitting as standing.  He said 
graciously: 
</p><p>"Don't be afraid, my dear girl.  I'm not that dangerous.'' 
</p><p>She lifted her eyes and looked at him.  She tried to 
conceal her aversion; she feared she was not succeeding. 
But she need not have concerned herself about that. 
General Siddall, after the manner of very rich men, 
could not conceive of anyone being less impressed with 
his superiority in any way than he himself was.  For 
years he had heard only flatteries of himself&mdash;his own 
voice singing his praises, the fawning voices of those 
he hired and of those hoping to get some financial 
advantage.  He could not have imagined a mere woman 
not being overwhelmed by the prospect of his courting 
her.  Nor would it have entered his head that his money 
would be the chief, much less the only, consideration 
with her.  He had long since lost all point of view, and 
believed that the adulation paid his wealth was evoked 
by his charms of person, mind, and manner.  Those 
who imagine this was evidence of folly and weak-mindedness 
and extraordinary vanity show how little they 
know human nature.  The strongest head could not re-
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0073" n="60"/> 
main steady, the most accurate eyes could not retain 
their measuring skill, in such an environment as always 
completely envelops wealth and power.  And the much-talked-of difference between those born to wealth and 
power and those who rise to it from obscurity resolves 
itself to little more than the difference between those 
born mad and those who go insane. 
</p><p>Looking at the little man with the disagreeable eyes, 
so dull yet so shrewd, Mildred saw that within the 
drunkard who could scarcely sit straight upon the richly 
upholstered and carved gilt chair there was another person, 
coldly sober, calmly calculating.  And she realized 
that it was this person with whom she was about to 
have the most serious conversation of her life thus far. 
</p><p>The drunkard smiled with a repulsive wiping and 
smacking of the thin, sensual lips.  "I suppose you 
know why I had you brought here this evening?'' said 
he. 
</p><p>Mildred looked and waited. 
</p><p>"I didn't intend to say anything to-night.  In fact, 
I didn't expect to find in you what I've been looking 
for.  I thought that old fool of a stepfather of yours 
was cracking up his goods beyond their merits.  But 
he wasn't.  My dear, you suit me from the ground 
up.  I've been looking you over carefully.  You were 
made for the place I want to fill.'' 
</p><p>Mildred had lowered her eyes.  Her face had become 
deathly pale.  "I feel faint,'' she murmured.  "It is 
very warm here.'' 
</p><p>"You're not sickly?'' inquired the general sharply. 
"You look like a good solid woman&mdash;thin but wiry. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0074" n="61"/> 
Ever been sick?  I must look into your health.  That's 
a point on which I must be satisfied.'' 
</p><p>A wave of anger swept through her, restoring her 
strength.  She was about to speak&mdash;a rebuke to his 
colossal impudence that he would not soon forget. 
Then she remembered, and bit her lips. 
</p><p>"I don't ask you to decide to-night,'' pursued he, 
hastening to explain this concession by adding:  "I 
don't intend to decide, myself.  All I say is that I am 
willing&mdash;if the goods are up to the sample.'' 
</p><p>Mildred saw her stepfather and her mother watching 
from just within the conservatory door.  A movement 
of the porti&egrave;re at the door into the hall let her 
know that Darcy, the butler, was peeping and listening 
there.  She stood up, clenched her hands, struck them 
together, struck them against her temples, crossed the 
room swiftly, flung herself down upon a sofa, and burst 
into tears.  Presbury and his wife entered.  Siddall 
was standing, looking after Mildred with a grin.  He 
winked at Presbury and said: 
</p><p>"I guess we gave her too much of that wine.  It's 
all old and stronger than you'd think.'' 
</p><p>"My daughter hardly touched her glasses,'' cried 
Mrs. Presbury. 
</p><p>"I know that, ma'am,'' replied Siddall.  "I watched 
her.  If she'd done much drinking, I'd have been done, 
then and there.'' 
</p><p>"I suspect she's upset by what you've been saying, 
General,'' said Presbury.  "Wasn't it enough to upset 
a girl?  You don't realize how magnificent you are&mdash; 
how magnificent everything is here.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0075" n="62"/>   
</p><p>"I'm sorry if I upset her,'' said the general, swelling 
and loftily contrite.  "I don t know why it is that people 
never seem to be able to act natural with me.''  He 
hated those who did, regarding them as sodden, 
unappreciative fools. 
</p><p>Mrs. Presbury was quieting her daughter.  Presbury 
and Siddall lighted cigars and went into the smoking&mdash; 
and billiard-room across the hall.  Said Presbury: 
</p><p>"I didn't deceive you, did I, General?'' 
</p><p>"She's entirely satisfactory,'' replied Siddall.  "I'm 
going to make careful inquiries about her character and 
her health.  If those things prove to be all right I'm 
ready to go ahead.'' 
</p><p>"Then the thing's settled,'' said Presbury.  "She's 
all that a lady should be.  And except a cold now and 
then she never has anything the matter with her.  She 
comes of good healthy stock.'' 
</p><p>"I can't stand a sickly, ailing woman,'' said Siddall. 
"I wouldn't marry one, and if one I married turned out 
to be that kind, I'd make short work of her.  When you 
get right down to facts, what is a woman?  Why, a 
body.  If she ain't pretty and well, she ain't nothing. 
While I'm looking up her pedigree, so to speak, I want 
you to get her mother to explain to her just what kind 
of a man I am.'' 
</p><p>"Certainly, certainly,'' said Presbury. 
</p><p>"Have her told that I don't put up with foolishness. 
If she wants to look at a man, let her look at me.'' 
</p><p>"You'll have no trouble in that way,'' said Presbury. 
</p><p>"I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> have trouble in that way,'' replied 
the general 
sourly.  "Women are fools&mdash;<hi rend="italic">all</hi> women.  But the 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0076" n="63"/> 
principal trouble with the second Mrs. Siddall was that 
she wasn't a lady born.'' 
</p><p>"That's why I say you'll have no trouble,'' said 
Presbury. 
</p><p>"Well, I want her mother to talk to her plainer than 
a gentleman can talk to a young lady.  I want her to 
understand that I am marrying so that I can have a 
<hi rend="italic">wife</hi>&mdash;cheerful, ready, and healthy.  I'll not put 
up 
with foolishness of any kind.'' 
</p><p>"I understand,'' said Presbury.  "You'll find that 
she'll meet all your conditions.'' 
</p><p>"Explain to her that, while I'm the easiest, most 
liberal-spending man in the world when I'm getting 
what I want, I am just the opposite when I'm not 
getting what I pay for.  If I take her and if she acts right, 
she'll have more of everything that women want than 
any woman in the world.  I'd take a pride in my wife. 
There isn't anything I wouldn't spend in showing her 
off to advantage.  And I'm willing to be liberal with 
her mother, too.'' 
</p><p>Presbury had been hoping for this.  His eyes sparkled. 
"You're a prince, General,'' he said.  "A genuine 
prince.  You know how to do things right.'' 
</p><p>"I flatter myself I do,'' said the general.  "I've 
been up and down the world, and I tell you most of the 
kings live cheap beside me.  And when I get a wife 
worth showing of, I'll do still better.  I've got wonderful 
creative ability.  There isn't anything I can't and 
won't buy.'' 
</p><p>Presbury noted uneasily how cold and straight, how 
obviously repelled and repelling the girl was as she 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0077" n="64"/>  
yielded her fingers to Siddall at the leave-taking.  He 
and her mother covered the silence and ice with hot and 
voluble sycophantry.  They might have spared themselves 
the exertion.  To Siddall Mildred was at her 
most fascinating when she was thus "the lady and the 
queen.''  The final impression she made upon him was 
the most favorable of all. 
</p><p>In the cab Mrs. Presbury talked out of the fullness 
of an overflowing heart.  "What a remarkable man 
the general is!'' said she.  "You've only to look at 
him to realize that you're in the presence of a really 
superior person.  And what tact he has!&mdash;and how 
generous he is!&mdash;and how beautifully he entertains! 
So much dignity&mdash;so much simplicity&mdash;so much&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"Fiddlesticks!'' interrupted Presbury.  "Your 
daughter isn't a damn fool, Mrs. Presbury.'' 
</p><p>Mildred gave a short, dry laugh. 
</p><p>Up flared her mother.  "I mean every word I said!'' 
cried she.  "If I hadn't admired and appreciated him, 
I'd certainly not have acted as I did.  <hi rend="italic">I</hi> couldn't 
stoop 
to such hypocrisy.'' 
</p><p>"Fiddlesticks!'' sneered Presbury.  "Bill Siddall is 
a horror.  His house is a horror.  His dinner was a 
horror.  These loathsome rich people!  They're ruining 
the world&mdash;as they always have.  They're making 
it impossible for anyone to get good service or good 
food or good furniture or good clothing or good 
anything.  They don't know good things, and they pay 
exorbitant prices for showy trash, for crude vulgar 
luxury.  They corrupt taste.  They make everyone 
round them or near them sycophants and cheats.  They 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0078" n="65"/> 
substitute money for intelligence and discrimination. 
They degrade every fine thing in life.  Civilization is 
built up by brains and hard work, and along come the 
rich and rot and ruin it!'' 
</p><p>Mildred and her mother were listening in astonishment. 
Said the mother: 
</p><p>"I'd be ashamed to confess myself such a hypocrite.'' 
</p><p>"And I, madam, would be ashamed to be such a 
hypocrite without taking a bath of confession afterward,'' 
retorted Presbury. 
</p><p>"At least you might have waited until Mildred 
wasn't in hearing,'' snapped she. 
</p><p>"I shall marry him if I can,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"And blissfully happy you'll be,'' said Presbury. 
"Women, ladies&mdash;true ladies, like you and your 
mother&mdash;have no sensibilities.  All you ask is luxury. 
If Bill Siddall were a thousand times worse than he is, 
his money would buy him almost any refined, delicate 
lady anywhere in Christendom.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Presbury laughed angrily.  "<hi rend="italic">You</hi>, 
talking like 
this&mdash;you of all men.  Is there anything <hi rend="italic">you</hi> 
wouldn't 
stoop to for money?'' 
</p><p>"Do you think I laid myself open to that charge by 
marrying you?'' said Presbury, made cheerful despite 
his savage indigestion by the opportunity for effective 
insult she had given him and he had promptly seized. 
"I am far too gallant to agree with you.  But I'm 
also too gallant to contradict a lady.  By the way, 
you must be careful in dealing with Siddall.  Rich people 
like to be fawned on, but not to be slobbered on. 
You went entirely too far.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0079" n="66"/>
</p><p>Mrs. Presbury, whom indigestion had rendered stupid, 
could think of no reply.  So she burst into tears. 
"And my own daughter sitting silent while that man 
insults her mother!'' she sobbed. 
</p><p>Mildred sat stiff and cold. 
</p><p>"It'll be a week before I recover from that dinner,'' 
Presbury went on sourly.  "What a dinner!  What a 
villainous mess!  These vulgar, showy rich!  That 
champagne!  He said it cost him six dollars a bottle, 
and no doubt it did.  I doubt if it ever saw France. 
The dealers rarely waste genuine wine on such cattle. 
The wine-cellars of fine houses the world through are 
the laughing-stock of connoisseurs&mdash;like their picture-galleries and their other attempts to make money do the 
work of taste.  I forgot to put my pills in my bag. 
I'll have to hunt up an all-night drug-store.  I'd not 
dare go to bed without taking an antidote for that 
poison.'' 
</p><p>But Presbury had not been altogether improvident. 
He had hoped great things of Bill Siddall's wine-cellar 
&mdash;this despite an almost unbroken series of bitter 
disillusionments and disappointments in experience with 
those who had the wealth to buy, if they had had the 
taste to select, the fine wines he loved.  So, resolving 
to indulge himself, he had put into his bag his pair of 
gout-boots. 
</p><p>This was a device of his own inventing, on which he 
prided himself.  It consisted of a pair of roomy doe-skin slippers re&euml;nforced with heavy soles and provided 
with a set of three thin insoles to be used according as 
the state of his toes made advisable.  The cost of the 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0080" n="67"/> 
Presbury gout-boot had been, thanks to patient search 
for a cheap cobbler, something under four dollars&mdash; 
this, when men paid shoe specialists twenty, thirty, and 
even forty dollars a pair for gout-boots that gave less 
comfort.  The morning after the dinner at which he 
had drunk to drown his chagrin and to give him courage 
and tongue for sycophantry, he put on the boots. 
Without them it would have been necessary to carry him 
from his room to a cab and from cab to train.  With 
them he was able to hobble to a street-car.  He tried 
to distract his mind from his sufferings by lashing 
away without ceasing at his wife and his step-daughter. 
</p><p>When they were once more at home, and the mother 
and daughter escaped from him, the mother said: 
</p><p>"I was glad to see that you put up with that wretch, 
and didn't answer him back.'' 
</p><p>"Of course,'' said Mildred.  "He's mad to be rid 
of me, but if I offended him he might snatch away this 
chance.'' 
</p><p>"He would,'' said Mrs. Presbury.  "I'm sure he 
would.  But&mdash;'' she laughed viciously&mdash;"once you're 
married you can revenge yourself&mdash;and me!'' 
</p><p>"I wonder,'' said Mildred thoughtfully. 
</p><p>"Why not?'' exclaimed her mother, irritated. 
</p><p>"I can't make Mr. Presbury out,'' replied the girl. 
"I understand why he's helping me to this chance, but 
I don't understand why he isn't making friends with me, 
in the hope of getting something after I'm married.'' 
</p><p>Her mother saw the point, and was instantly agitated. 
"Perhaps he's simply leading you on, intending to up-
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0081" n="68"/>  
set it all at the last minute.''  She gritted her teeth. 
"Oh, what a wretch!'' 
</p><p>Mildred was not heeding.  "I must have General 
Siddall looked up carefully,'' she went on.  "It may 
be that he isn't rich, or that he has another wife 
somewhere, or that there's some other awful reason 
why marrying him would be even worse than it 
seems.'' 
</p><p>"Worse than it seems!'' cried her mother.  "How 
<hi rend="italic">can</hi> you talk so, Milly!  The general seems to be an 
ideal husband&mdash;simply ideal!  I wish <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had your 
chance.  Any sensible woman could love him.'' 
</p><p>A strange look came into the girl's face, and her 
mother could not withstand her eyes.  "Don't, mother,'' 
she said quietly.  "Either you take me for a fool or 
you are trying to show me that you have no self-respect.  I am not deceiving myself about what I'm doing.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Presbury opened her lips to remonstrate, 
changed her mind, drew a deep sigh.  "It's frightful 
to be a woman,'' she said. 
</p><p>"To be a lady, Mr. Presbury would say,'' suggested 
Mildred. 
</p><p>After some discussion, they fixed upon Joseph Tilker 
as the best available investigator of General Siddall. 
Tilker had been head clerk for Henry Gower.  He was 
now in for himself and had offered to look after any 
legal business Mrs. Presbury might have without 
charging her.  He presently reported that there was 
not a doubt as to the wealth of the little general. 
"There are all sorts of ugly stories about how he made 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0082" n="69"/> 
his money,'' said Tilker; "but all the great fortunes 
have a scandalous history, and I doubt if Siddall's is 
any worse than the others.  I don't see how it well could 
be.  Siddall has the reputation of being a mean and 
cruel little tyrant.  He is said to be pompous, vain, 
ignorant&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"Indeed he's not,'' cried Mrs. Presbury.  "He's a 
rough diamond, but a natural gentleman.  I've met 
him.'' 
</p><p>"Well, he's rich enough, and that was all you asked 
me to find out,'' said Tilker.  "But I must warn you, 
Mrs. Presbury, not to have any business or intimate 
personal relations with him.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Presbury congratulated herself on her wisdom 
in having come alone to hear Tilker's report.  She did 
not repeat any part of it to Mildred except what he had 
said about the wealth.  That she enlarged upon until 
Mildred's patience gave out.  She interrupted with a 
shrewd: 
</p><p>"Anything else, mamma?  Anything about him personally?'' 
</p><p>"We've got to judge him in that way for ourselves,'' 
replied Mrs. Presbury.  "You know how wickedly they 
lie about anyone who has anything.'' 
</p><p>"I should like to read a full account of General 
Siddall,'' said Mildred reflectively; "just to satisfy my 
curiosity.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Presbury made no reply. 
</p><p>Presbury had decided that it was best to make no 
advance, but to wait until they heard from Siddall.  He 
let a week, ten days, go by; then his impatience got 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0083" n="70"/>
the better of his shrewdness.  He sought admittance 
to the great man at the offices of the International 
Metals and Minerals Company in Cedar Street.  After 
being subjected to varied indignities by sundry under-strappers, he received a message from the general 
through a secretary:  "The general says he'll let you 
know when he's ready to take up that matter.  He says 
he hasn't got round to it yet.''  Presbury apologized 
courteously for his intrusion and went away, cursing 
under his breath.  You may be sure that he made his 
wife and his stepdaughter suffer for what he had been 
through.  Two weeks more passed&mdash;three&mdash;a month. 
One morning in the mail there arrived this note&mdash;type-written upon business paper: 
 
JAMES PRESBURY, Esqr.: 
      <hi rend="italic">Dear Sir:</hi> 
            General Siddall asks me to present his compliments 
and to say that he will be pleased if you and your wife and 
the young lady will dine with him at his house next Thursday 
the seventeenth at half-past seven sharp. 
                  ROBERT CHANDLESS, Secretary. 
 
</p><p>The only words in longhand were the two forming 
the name of the secretary.  Presbury laughed and 
tossed the note across the breakfast table to his wife. 
"You see what an ignorant creature he is,'' said he. 
"He imagines he has done the thing up in grand style. 
He's the sort of man that can't be taught manners 
because he thinks manners, the ordinary civilities, are for 
the lower orders of people.  Oh, he's a joke, is Bill 
Siddall&mdash;a horrible joke.'' 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0084" n="71"/>  
</p><p>Mrs. Presbury read and passed the letter to Mildred. 
She simply glanced at it and returned it to her step-father. 
</p><p>"I'm just about over that last dinner,'' pursued 
Presbury.  "I'll eat little Thursday and drink less. 
And I'd advise you to do the same, Mrs. Presbury.'' 
</p><p>He always addressed her as "Mrs. Presbury'' 
because he had discovered that when so addressed she 
always winced, and, if he put a certain tone into his voice, 
she quivered. 
</p><p>"That dinner aged you five years,'' he went on. 
"Besides, you drank so much that it went to your head 
and made you slather him with flatteries that irritated 
him.  He thought you were a fool, and no one is stupid 
enough to like to be flattered by a fool.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Presbury bridled, swallowed hard, said mildly: 
"We'll have to spend the night in town again, I suppose.'' 
</p><p>"You and your daughter may do as you like,'' said 
Presbury.  "I shall return here that night.  I always 
catch cold in strange beds.'' 
</p><p>"We might as well all return here,'' said Mildred. 
"I shall not wear evening dress; that is, I'll wear a 
high-neck dress and a hat.'' 
</p><p>She had just got a new hat that was peculiarly 
becoming to her.  She had shown Siddall herself at the 
best in evening attire; another sort of costume would 
give him a different view of her looks, one which she 
flattered herself was not less attractive.  But Presbury 
interposed an emphatic veto. 
</p><p>"You'll wear full evening dress,'' said he.  "Bare 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0085" n="72"/> 
neck and arms for men like Bill Siddall.  They want 
to see what they're getting.'' 
</p><p>Mildred flushed scarlet and her lips trembled as 
though she were about to cry.  In fact, her emotion 
was altogether shame&mdash;a shame so poignant that even 
Presbury was abashed, and mumbled something apologetic. 
Nevertheless she wore a low-neck dress on Thursday 
evening, one as daring as the extremely daring 
fashions of that year permitted an unmarried woman 
to wear.  It seemed to her that Siddall was still more 
costly and elegant-looking than before, though this 
may have been due to the fact that he always created an 
impression that in the retrospect of memory seemed 
exaggerated.  It seemed impossible that anyone could be 
so clean, so polished and scoured, so groomed and 
tailored, so bedecked, so high-heeled and loftily coiffed. 
His mean little countenance with its grotesquely waxed 
mustache and imperial wore an expression of gracious 
benignity that assured his guests they need anticipate 
no disagreeable news. 
</p><p>"I owe you an apology for keeping you in suspense 
so long,'' said he.  "I'm a very busy man, with 
interests in all parts of the world.  I keep house&mdash; 
some of 'em bigger than this&mdash;open and going in sis 
different places.  I always like to be at home wherever 
my business takes me.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Presbury rolled her eyes.  "Isn't that <hi rend="italic">wonderful!</hi>'' 
she exclaimed.  "What an interesting life you 
must lead!'' 
</p><p>"Oh, so&mdash;so,'' replied the general.  "But I get 
awful lonesome.  I'm naturally a domestic man.  I 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0086" n="73"/>  
don't care for friends.  They're expensive and dangerous. 
A man in my position is like a king.  He can't 
have friends.  So, if he hasn't got a family, he hasn't 
got noth&mdash;anything.'' 
</p><p>"Nothing like home life,'' said Presbury. 
</p><p>"Yes, indeed,'' cried Mrs. Presbury. 
</p><p>The little general smiled upon Mildred, sitting pale 
and silent, with eyes downcast.  "Well, I don't intend 
to be alone much longer, if I can help it,'' said he. 
"And I may say that I can make a woman happy if 
she's the right sort&mdash;if she has sense enough to 
appreciate a good husband.''  This last he said sternly, 
with more than a hint of his past matrimonial misfortunes 
in his frown and in his voice.  "The trouble with 
a great many women is that they're fools&mdash;flighty, 
ungrateful fools.  If I married a woman like that, I'd 
make short work of her.'' 
</p><p>"And she'd deserve it, General,'' said Mildred's 
mother earnestly.  "But you'll have no trouble if you 
select a lady&mdash;a girl who's been well brought up and 
has respect for herself.'' 
</p><p>"That's my opinion, ma'am,'' said the general. 
"I'm convinced that while a man can become a gentleman, 
a woman's got to be born a lady or she never is 
one.'' 
</p><p>"Very true, General,'' cried Mrs. Presbury.  "I 
never thought of it before, but it's the truest thing I 
ever heard.'' 
</p><p>Presbury grinned at his plate.  He stole a glance at 
Mildred.  Their eyes met.  She flushed faintly. 
</p><p>"I've had a great deal of experience of women,'' pur-
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0087" n="74"/>  
sued the general.  "In my boyhood days I was a ladies' 
man.  And of course since I've had money they've 
swarmed round me like bees in a clover-patch.'' 
</p><p>"Oh, General, you're far too modest,'' cried Mrs. 
Presbury.  "A man like you wouldn't need to be 
afraid, if he hadn't a cent.'' 
</p><p>"But not the kind of women I want,'' replied he, 
firmly if complacently.  "A lady needs money to keep 
up her position.  She has to have it.  On the other 
hand, a man of wealth and station needs a lady to 
assist him in the proper kind of life for men of his sort. 
So they need each other.  They've got to have each 
other.  That's the practical, sensible way to look at it.'' 
</p><p>"Exactly,'' said Presbury. 
</p><p>"And I've made up my mind to marry, and marry 
right away.  But we'll come back to this later on. 
Presbury, you're neglecting that wine.'' 
</p><p>"I'm drinking it slowly to enjoy it better,'' said Presbury. 
</p><p>The dinner was the same unending and expensive 
function that had wearied them and upset their digestions 
on Thanksgiving Day.  There was too much of 
everything, and it was all just wrong.  The general 
was not quite so voluble as he had been before; his gaze 
was fixed most of the time on Mildred&mdash;roving from 
her lovely face to her smooth, slender shoulders and back 
again.  As he drank and ate his gesture of slightly 
smacking his thin lips seemed to include an enjoyment 
of the girl's charms.  And a sensitive observer might 
have suspected that she was not unconscious of this and 
was suffering some such pain as if abhorrent and cruel 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0088" n="75"/> 
lips and teeth were actually mouthing and mumbling 
her.  She said not a word from sitting down at table 
until they rose to go into the library for coffee. 
</p><p>"Do tell me about your early life, General,'' Mrs. 
Presbury said.  "Only the other day Millie was saying 
she wished she could read a biography of your romantic 
career.'' 
</p><p>"Yes, it has been rather&mdash;unusual,'' conceded the 
general with swelling chest and gently waving dollar-and-a-half-apiece cigar. 
</p><p>"I do so <hi rend="italic">admire</hi> a man who carves out his 
own 
fortune,'' Mrs. Presbury went on&mdash;she had not obeyed 
her husband's injunction as to the champagne.  "It 
seems so wonderful to me that a man could with his own 
hands just dig a fortune out of the ground.'' 
</p><p>"He couldn't, ma'am,'' said the general, with 
gracious tolerance.  "It wasn't till I stopped the fool 
digging and hunting around for gold that I began to get 
ahead.  I threw away the pick and shovel and opened 
a hotel.''  (There were two or three sleeping-rooms of 
a kind in that "hotel,'' but it was rather a saloon of 
the species known as "doggery.'')  "Yes, it was in the 
hotel that I got my start.  The fellows that make the 
money in mining countries ain't the prospectors and 
diggers, ma'am.'' 
</p><p>"Really!'' cried Mrs. Presbury breathlessly.  "How 
interesting!'' 
</p><p>"They're fools, they are,'' proceeded the general. 
"No, the money's made by the fellows that grub-stake 
the fools&mdash;give 'em supplies and send 'em out to nose 
around in the mountains.  Then them that find any-
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0089" n="76"/> 
thing have to give half to the fellow that did the grub-staking.  And he looks into the claim, and if there's 
anything in it, why, he buys the fool out.  In mines, 
like everywhere else, ma'am, it ain't work, it's brains 
that makes the money.  No miner ever made a mining 
fortune&mdash;not one.  It's the brainy, foxy fellows that 
stay back in the camps.  I used to send out fifty and a 
hundred men a year.  Maybe only two or three'd turn 
up anything worth while.  No, ma'am, I never got a 
dollar ahead on my digging.  All the gold I ever dug 
went right off for grub&mdash;or a good time.'' 
</p><p>"Wonderful!'' exclaimed Mrs. Presbury.  "I never 
heard of such a thing.'' 
</p><p>"But we're not here to talk about mines,'' said the 
general, his eyes upon Mildred.  "I've been looking 
into matters&mdash;to get down to business&mdash;and I've 
asked you here to let you know that I'm willing to go 
ahead.'' 
</p><p>Profound silence.  Mildred suddenly drew in her 
breath with a sound so sharp that the three others 
started and glanced hastily at her.  But she made no 
further sign.  She sat still and cold and pale. 
</p><p>The general, perfectly at ease, broke the silence. 
"I think Miss Gower and I would get on faster 
alone.'' 
</p><p>Presbury at once stood up; his wife hesitated, her 
eyes uneasily upon her daughter.  Presbury said: 
"Come on, Alice.''  She rose and preceded him into the 
adjoining conservatory.  The little general posed 
himself before the huge open fire, one hand behind him, 
the other at the level of his waistcoat, the big cigar be-
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0090" n="77"/>   
tween his first and second fingers.  "Well, my dear?'' 
said he. 
</p><p>Mildred somewhat hesitatingly lifted her eyes; but, 
once she had them up, their gaze held steadily enough 
upon his&mdash;too steadily for his comfort.  He addressed 
himself to his cigar: 
</p><p>"I'm not quite ready to say I'm willing to go the 
limit,'' said he.  "We don't exactly know each other 
sufficiently well as yet, do we?'' 
</p><p>"No,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"I've been making inquiries,'' he went on; "that is, 
I had my chief secretary make them&mdash;and he's a very 
thorough man, thanks to my training.  He reports 
everything entirely all right.  I admire dignity and 
reserve in a woman, and you have been very particular. 
Were you engaged to Stanley Baird?'' 
</p><p>Mildred flushed, veiled her eyes to hide their resentful 
flash at this impertinence.  She debated with herself, 
decided that any rebuke short of one that would 
anger him would be wasted upon him.  "No,'' said she. 
</p><p>"That agrees with Harding's report,'' said the 
general.  "It was a mere girlish flirtation&mdash;very dignified 
and proper,'' he hastened to add.  "I don't mean 
to suggest that you were at all flighty.'' 
</p><p>"Thank you,'' said Mildred sweetly. 
</p><p>"Are there any questions you would like to ask about 
me?'' inquired he. 
</p><p>"No,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"As I understand it&mdash;from my talk with Presbury 
&mdash;you are willing to go on?'' 
</p><p>"Yes,'' said Mildred. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0091" n="78"/>
</p><p>The general smiled genially.  "I think I may say 
without conceit that you will like me as you know me 
better.  I have no bad habits&mdash;I've too much regard 
for my health to over-indulge or run loose.  In my 
boyhood days I may have put in rather a heavy sowing 
of wild oats''&mdash;the general laughed; Mildred conjured 
up the wintriest and faintest of echoing smiles&mdash;"but 
that's all past,'' he went on, "and there's nothing that 
could rise up to interfere with our happiness.  You are 
fond of children?'' 
</p><p>A pause, then Mildred said quite evenly, "Yes.'' 
</p><p>"Excellent,'' said the general.  "I'll expect you and 
your mother and father to dinner Sunday night.  Is 
that satisfactory?'' 
</p><p>"Yes,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>A longish pause.  Then the general:  "You seem to 
be a little&mdash;afraid of me.  I don't know why it is that 
people are always that way with me.''  A halt, to give 
her the opportunity to say the obvious flattering thing. 
Mildred said nothing, gave no sign.  He went on:  "It 
will wear away as we know each other better.  I am a 
simple, plain man&mdash;kind and generous in my instincts. 
Of course I am dignified, and I do not like familiarity. 
But I do not mean to inspire fear and awe.'' 
</p><p>A still longer pause.  "Well, everything is settled,'' 
said the general.  "We understand each other clearly? 
&mdash;not an engagement, nothing binding on either side 
&mdash;simply a&mdash;a&mdash;an option without forfeit.''  And 
he laughed&mdash;his laugh was a ghoulish sound, not loud 
but explosive and an instant check upon demonstration 
of mirth from anyone else. 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0092" n="79"/>  
</p><p>"I understand,'' said Mildred with a glance toward 
the door through which Presbury and his wife had disappeared. 
</p><p>"Now, we'll join the others, and I'll show you the 
house''&mdash;again the laugh&mdash;"what may be your future 
home&mdash;one of them.'' 
</p><p>The four were soon started upon what was for three 
of them a weariful journey despite the elevator that 
spared them the ascents of the stairways.  The house 
was an exaggerated reproduction of all the establishments 
of the rich who confuse expenditure with luxury 
and comfort.  Bill Siddall had bought "the best of 
everything''; that is, the things into which the purveyors 
of costly furnishings have put the most excuses for 
charging.  Of taste, of comfort, of discrimination, 
there were few traces and these obviously accidental. 
"I picked out the men acknowledged to be the best in 
their different lines,'' said the general, "and I gave them 
<hi rend="italic">carte blanche</hi>.'' 
</p><p>"I see that at a glance,'' said Presbury.  "You've 
done the grand thing on the grandest possible scale.'' 
</p><p>"I've looked into the finest of the famous places on 
the other side,'' said the general.  "All I can say is, 
I've had no regrets.'' 
</p><p>"I should say not,'' cried Mrs. Presbury. 
</p><p>With an affectation of modest hesitation&mdash;to show 
that he was a gentleman with a gentleman's fine appreciation 
of the due of maiden modesty&mdash;Siddall paused 
at the outer door of his own apartments.  But at one 
sentence of urging from Mrs. Presbury he opened the 
door and ushered them in.  And soon he was showing 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0093" n="80"/>  
them everything&mdash;his Carrara marble bathroom and 
bathing-pool, his bed that had been used by several 
French kings, his dressing-room with its appliances of 
gold and platinum and precious stones, his clothing. 
They had to inspect a room full of suits, huge 
chiffoniers crowded with shirts and ties and underclothes. 
He exhibited silk dressing-robes and pajamas, pointed 
out the marks of the fashionable London and Paris 
makers, the monograms, the linings of ermine and sable. 
"I'm very particular about everything that touches 
me,'' explained he.  "It seems to me a gentleman can't 
be too particular.''  With a meaning glance at Mildred, 
"And I'd feel the same way about my wife.'' 
</p><p>"You hear that, Mildred?'' said Presbury, with a 
nasty little laugh.  He had been relieving the tedium 
of this sight-seeing tour by observing&mdash;and from time 
to time aggravating&mdash;Mildred's sufferings. 
</p><p>The general released his mirth-strangling goat laugh; 
Mrs. Presbury echoed it with a gale of rather wild 
hysterics.  So well pleased was the general with the excursion 
and so far did he feel advanced toward intimacy that on 
the way down the majestic marble stairway he ventured 
to give Mildred's arm a gentle, playful squeeze.  And at 
the parting he kissed her hand.  Presbury had changed 
his mind about returning to the country.  On the way 
to the hotel he girded at Mildred, reviewing all that the 
little general had said and done, and sneering, jeering 
at it.  Mildred made not a single retort until they 
were upstairs in the hotel.  At the door to her room 
she said to Presbury&mdash;said it in a quiet, cold, terrible 
way: 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0094" n="81"/>  
</p><p>"If you really want me to go through with this 
thing, you will stop insulting him and me.  If you do it 
again, I'll give up&mdash;and go on the streets before I'll 
marry him.'' 
</p><p>Presbury shrugged his shoulders and went on to the 
other room.  But he did not begin again the next day, 
and from that time forth avoided reference to the 
general.  In fact, there was an astonishing change in his 
whole demeanor.  He ceased to bait his wife, became 
polite, even affable.  If he had conducted himself thus 
from the outset, he would have got far less credit, would 
have made far less progress toward winning the liking 
of his wife, and of her daughter, than he did in a brief 
two weeks of change from petty and malignant tyrant 
to good-natured, interestingly talkative old gentleman. 
After the manner of human nature, Mildred and her 
mother, in their relief, in their pleasure through this 
amazing sudden and wholly unexpected geniality, not 
merely forgave but forgot all they had suffered at his 
hands.  Mildred was not without a suspicion of the 
truth that this change, inaugurated in his own good 
time, was fresh evidence of his contempt for both of 
them&mdash;of his feeling that he could easily make reparation 
with a little kindness and decency and put himself 
in the way of getting any possible benefits from the 
rich alliance.  But though she practically knew what 
was going on in his mind, she could not prevent herself 
from softening toward him. 
</p><p>Now followed a succession of dinners, of theater-and 
opera-goings, of week-ends at the general's new country 
palace in the fashionable region of Long Island. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0095" n="82"/>
All these festivities were of the same formal and tedious 
character.  At all the general was the central sun with 
the others dim and draggled satellites, hardly more 
important than the outer rim of satellite servants.  He 
did most of the talking; he was the sole topic of 
conversation; for when he was not talking about himself 
he wished to be hearing about himself.  If Mildred had 
not been seeing more and more plainly that other and 
real personality of his, her contempt for him and for 
herself would have grown beyond control.  But, with 
him or away from him, at every instant there was the 
sense of that other real William Siddall&mdash;a shadowy 
menace full of terror.  She dreamed of it&mdash;was 
startled from sleep by visions of a monstrous and 
mighty distortion of the little general's grotesque 
exterior.  "I shall marry him if I can,'' she said to her 
self.  "But&mdash;can I?''  And she feared and hoped 
that she could not, that courage would fail her, or 
would come to her rescue, whichever it was, and that 
she would refuse him.  Aside from the sense of her 
body that cannot but be with any woman who is beautiful, 
she had never theretofore been especially physical 
in thought.  That side of life had remained vague, as 
she had never indulged in or even been strongly tempted 
with the things that rouse it from its virginal sleep. 
But now she thought only of her body, because that it 
was, and that alone, that had drawn this prospective 
purchaser, and his eyes never let her forget it.  She 
fell into the habit of looking at herself in the glass&mdash; 
at her face, at her shoulders, at her whole person, not 
in vanity but in a kind of wonder or aversion.  And 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0096" n="83"/>  
in the visions, both the waking and the sleeping, she 
reached the climax of horror when the monster touched 
her&mdash;with clammy, creepy fingers, with munching lips, 
with the sharp ends of the mustache or imperial. 
</p><p>Said Mrs. Presbury to her husband, "I'm afraid the 
general will be irritated by Mildred's unresponsiveness.'' 
</p><p>"Don't worry,'' replied Presbury.  "He's so crazy 
about himself that he imagines the whole world is in the 
same state.'' 
</p><p>"Isn't it strange that he doesn't give her presents? 
Never anything but candy and flowers.'' 
</p><p>"And he never will,'' said Presbury. 
</p><p>"Not until they're married, I suppose.'' 
</p><p>Presbury was silent. 
</p><p>"I can't help thinking that if Milly were to rouse 
herself and show some&mdash;some liking&mdash;or at least 
interest, it'd be wiser.'' 
</p><p>"She's taking the best possible course,'' said 
Presbury.  "Unconsciously to both of them, she's leading 
him on.  He thinks that's the way a lady should act&mdash; 
restrained, refined.'' 
</p><p>Mildred's attitude was simple inertia.  The most 
positive effort she made was avoiding saying or doing 
anything to displease him&mdash;no difficult matter, as she 
was silent and almost lifeless when he was near.  Without 
any encouragement from her he gradually got a 
deep respect for her&mdash;which meant that he became 
convinced of her coldness and exclusiveness, of her 
absolute trustworthiness.  Presbury was more profoundly 
right than he knew.  The girl pursued the only course 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0097" n="84"/> 
that made possible the success she longed for, yet 
dreaded and loathed.  For at the outset Siddall had 
not been nearly so strongly in earnest in his matrimonial 
project as he had professed and had believed 
himself.  He wished to marry, wished to add to his 
possessions the admirable show-piece and exhibition 
opportunity afforded by the right sort of wife; but in the 
bottom of his heart he felt that such a woman as he 
dreamed of did not exist in all the foolish, fickle, and 
shallow female sex.  This girl&mdash;so cold, so proud, 
beautiful yet not eager to display her charms or to have 
them praised&mdash;she was the rare bird he sought. 
</p><p>In a month he asked her to marry him; that is, he 
said:  "My dear, I find that I am ready to go the 
limit&mdash;if you are.''  And she assented.  He put his 
arm around her and kissed her cheek&mdash;and was 
delighted to discover that the alluring embrace made no 
impression upon the ice of her "purity and ladylike 
dignity.''  Up to the very last moment of the formal 
courtship he held himself ready to withdraw should she 
reveal to his watchfulness the slightest sign of having 
any "unladylike'' tendencies or feelings.  She revealed 
no such sign, but remained "ladylike''; and certainly, 
so the general reasoned, a woman who could thus resist 
him, even in the license of the formal engagement, would 
resist anybody. 
</p><p>As soon as the engagement was formally concluded, 
the general hurried on the preparations for the wedding. 
He opened accounts at half a dozen shops in 
New York&mdash;dressmakers, milliners, dealers in fine and 
fashionable clothing of every kind&mdash;and gave them 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0098" n="85"/>   
orders to execute whatever commands Miss Gower or 
her mother&mdash;for <hi rend="italic">her</hi>&mdash;might give them.  When he 
told her of this munificence and magnificence and paused 
for the outburst of gratitude, he listened in vain. 
Mildred colored to the roots of her hair and was silent, was 
seeking the courage to refuse. 
</p><p>"I know that you and your people can't afford to do 
the thing as things related to me must be done,'' he 
went on to say.  "So I decided to just start in a little 
early at what I've got to do anyhow.  Not that I blame 
you for your not having money, my dear.  On the contrary, 
that's one of your merits with me.  I wouldn't 
marry a woman with money.  It puts the family life on 
a wrong basis.'' 
</p><p>"I had planned a quiet wedding,'' said Mildred. 
"I'd much prefer it.'' 
</p><p>"Now you can be frank with me, my dear,'' said the 
general.  "I know you ladies&mdash;how cheated you feel 
if you aren't married with all the frills and fixings. 
So that's the way it shall be done.'' 
</p><p>"Really,'' protested Mildred, "I'm absolutely frank. 
I wish it to be quite quiet&mdash;in our drawing-room, with 
no guests.'' 
</p><p>Siddall smiled, genial and tolerant.  "Don't argue 
with me, my dear.  I know what you want, and I'll see 
that you get it.  Go ahead with these shop-people I've 
put at your disposal&mdash;and go as far as you like. 
</p><p>There isn't anything&mdash;<hi rend="italic">anything</hi>&mdash;in the way 
of 
clothes that you can't have&mdash;that you mustn't have. 
Mrs. General Siddall is going to be the best-dressed 
woman in the world&mdash;as she is the prettiest.  I haven't 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0099" n="86"/>
opened an account for you with Tiffany's or any of 
those people.  I'll look out for that part of the 
business, myself.'' 
</p><p>"I don't care for jewelry,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"Naturally not for the kind that's been within your 
means heretofore,'' replied he; "but you'll open your 
eyes when you see <hi rend="italic">my</hi> jewelry for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> wife.  All in 
good time, my dear.  You and your mother must start 
right in with the shopping; and, a week or so before 
the wedding, I'll send my people down to transform the 
house.  I may be wrong, but I rather think that the 
Siddall wedding will cause some talk.'' 
</p><p>He was not wrong.  Through his confidential 
secretary, Harding the thorough, the newspaper press was 
induced to take an interest in the incredible extravagance 
Siddall was perpetrating in arranging for a fitting 
wedding for General William Siddall.  For many 
days before the ceremony there were daily columns 
about him and his romantic career and his romantic 
wooing of the New Jersey girl of excellent family and 
social position but of comparatively modest means. 
The shopkeepers gave interviews on the trousseau.  The 
decorators and caterers detailed the splendors and the 
costliness of the preparations of which they had charge. 
From morning until dark a crowd hung round the house 
at Hanging Rock, and on the wedding day the streets 
leading to it were blocked&mdash;chiefly with people come 
from a distance, many of them from New York. 
</p><p>At the outset all this noise was deeply distasteful to 
Mildred, but after a few days she recovered her normal 
point of view, forgot the kind of man she was marry-
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0100" n="87"/>  
ing in the excitement and exultation over her sudden 
splendor and fame.  So strongly did the delusion presently 
become, that she was looking at the little general 
with anything but unfavorable eyes.  He seemed to her 
a quaint, fascinating, benevolent necromancer, having 
miraculous powers which he was exercising in her behalf. 
She even reproached herself with ingratitude in not 
being wildly in love with him.  Would not any other 
girl, in her place, have fallen over ears in love with 
this marvelous man? 
</p><p>However, while she could not quite convince herself 
that she loved, she became convinced without effort that 
she was happy, that she was going to be still happier. 
The excitement wrought her into a state of exaltation 
and swept her through the wedding ceremony and the 
going away as radiant a bride as a man would care to 
have. 
</p><p>There is much to be said against the noisy, showy 
wedding.  Certainly love has rarely been known to 
degrade himself to the point of attending any such.  But 
there is something to be said for that sort of married 
start&mdash;for instance, where love is neither invited nor 
desired, an effort must be made to cover the painful 
vacancy his absence always causes. 
</p><p>The little general's insistence on a "real wedding'' 
was most happy for him.  It probably got him his 
bride. </p>

<head> III </head>
<p>THE intoxication of that wedding held on long enough 
and strongly enough to soften and blunt the disillusionments 
of the first few days of the honeymoon.  In the 
prospect that period had seemed, even to Mildred's 
rather unsophisticated imagination, appalling beyond 
her power to endure.  In the fact&mdash;thanks in large 
part to that intoxication&mdash;it was certainly not 
unendurable.  A human being, even an innocent young girl, 
can usually bear up under any experience to which a 
human being can be subjected.  The general in pajamas&mdash; 
of the finest silk and of pigeon's-egg blue 
with a vast gorgeous monogram on the pocket&mdash;was 
more grotesque, rather than more repellent, than the 
general in morning or evening attire.  Also he&mdash;that 
is, his expert staff of providers of luxury&mdash;had 
arranged for the bride a series of the most ravishing 
sensations in whisking her, like the heroine of an Arabian 
Night's tale, from straitened circumstances to the very 
paradise of luxury. 
</p><p>The general's ideas on the subject of woman were old 
fashioned, of the hard-shell variety.  Woman was made 
for luxury, and luxury was made for woman.  His 
woman must be the most divinely easeful of the luxurious. 
At all times she must be fit and ready for any 
and every sybaritic idea that might enter her husband's 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0102" n="89"/>
head&mdash;and other purpose she had none.  When she 
was not directly engaged in ministering to his joy she 
must be busy preparing herself for his next call upon 
her.  A woman was a luxury, was the luxury of 
luxuries, must have and must use to their uttermost all 
capacities for gratifying his senses and his vanity. 
Alone with him, she must make him constantly feel how 
rich and rare and expensive a prize he had captured. 
When others were about, she must be constantly making 
them envy and admire him for having exclusive 
rights in such wonderful preserves.  All this with an 
inflexible devotion to the loftiest ideals of chastity. 
</p><p>But the first realizations of her husband's notions as 
to women were altogether pleasant.  As she entered the 
automobile in which they went to the private car in the 
special train that took them to New York and the 
steamer&mdash;as she entered that new and prodigally 
luxurious automobile, she had a first, keen sense of her 
changed position.  Then there was the superb private 
car&mdash;her car, since she was his wife&mdash;and there was 
the beautiful suite in the magnificent steamer.  And at 
every instant menials thrusting attentions upon her, 
addressing her as if she were a queen, revealing in their 
nervous tones and anxious eyes their eagerness to please, 
their fear of displeasing.  And on the steamer, from 
New York to Cherbourg, she was never permitted to 
lose sight of the material splendors that were now hers. 
All the servants, all the passengers, reminded her by 
their looks, their tones.  At Paris, in the hotel, in the 
restaurants, in the shops&mdash;especially in the shops&mdash; 
those snobbish instincts that are latent in the sanest 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0103" n="90"/> 
and the wisest of us were fed and fattened and pampered 
until her head was quite turned.  And the general 
began to buy jewels for her.  Such jewels&mdash; 
ropes of diamonds and pearls and emeralds, rings such 
as she had never dreamed existed!  Those shopping 
excursions of theirs in the Rue de la Paix would make such 
a tale as your ordinary simple citizen, ignorant of the 
world's resources in luxury and therefore incredulous 
about them, would read with a laugh at the extravagance 
of the teller. 
</p><p>Before the intoxication of the wedding had worn 
away it was re&euml;nforced by the intoxication of the honey-moon&mdash;not an intoxication of love's providing, but 
one exceeding potent in its influence upon our weak 
human brains and hearts, one from which the strongest 
of us, instead of sneering at poor Mildred, would better 
be praying to be delivered. 
</p><p>At her marriage she had a few hundred dollars left 
of her patrimony&mdash;three hundred and fifty and odd, 
to be more exact.  She spent a little money of her own 
here and there&mdash;in tips, in buying presents for her 
mother, in picking up trifles for her own toilet.  The 
day came when she looked in her purse and found two 
one-franc pieces, a fifty-franc note, and a few coppers. 
And suddenly she sat back and stared, her mouth open 
like her almost empty gold bag, which the general had 
bought her on their first day in the Rue de la Paix. 
About ten dollars in all the world, and the general had 
forgotten to speak&mdash;or to make any arrangement, at 
least any arrangement of which she was aware&mdash;about 
a further supply of money. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0104" n="91"/>  
</p><p>They had been married nearly a month.  He knew 
that she was poor.  Why hadn't he said something or, 
better still, <hi rend="italic">done</hi> something?  Doubtless he had 
simply 
forgotten.  But since he had forgotten for a month, 
might he not continue to forget?  True, he had himself 
been poor at one time in his life, very poor, and 
that for a long time.  But it had been so many years 
ago that he had probably lost all sense of the meaning 
of poverty.  She frowned at this evidence of his lack 
of the finer sensibilities&mdash;by no means the first time 
that lack had been disagreeably thrust upon her.  Soon 
she would be without money&mdash;and she must have money 
&mdash;not much, as all the serious expenses were looked 
after by the general, but still a little money.  How 
could she get it?  How could she remind him of his 
neglect without seeming to be indelicate?  It was a 
difficult problem.  She worked at it more and more 
continuously, and irritably, and nervously, as the days 
went by and her fifty-two francs dwindled to five. 
</p><p>She lay awake, planning long and elaborate 
conversations that would imperceptibly lead him up to where 
he must see what she needed without seeing that he had 
been led.  She carried out these ingenious conversations. 
She led him along, he docilely and unsuspectingly 
following.  She brought him up to where it 
seemed to her impossible for any human being endowed 
with the ordinary faculties to fail to see what was so 
plainly in view.  All in vain.  General William Siddall 
gazed placidly&mdash;and saw nothing. 
</p><p>Several days of these failures, and with her funds 
reduced to a fifty-centime piece and a two-sous copper 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0105" n="92"/>  
she made a frontal attack.  When they went forth for 
the day's shopping she left her gold bag behind.  After 
an hour or so she said: 
</p><p>"I've got to go to the Galleries Lafayette for some 
little things.  I shan't ask you to sacrifice yourself.  I 
know you hate those stuffy, smelly big shops.'' 
</p><p>"Very well,'' said he.  "I'll use the time in a call 
on my bankers.'' 
</p><p>As they were about to separate, she taking the motor 
and he walking, she made a face of charming dismay 
and said:  "How provoking!  I've left my bag at the 
hotel.'' 
</p><p>Instead of the expected prompt offer of money he 
said, "It'll only take you a minute or so to drive there.'' 
</p><p>"But it's out of the way,'' she replied.  "I'll need 
only a hundred francs or so.'' 
</p><p>Said he:  "I've an account at the Bon March&eacute;.  Go 
there and have the things charged.  It's much the best 
big shop in Paris.'' 
</p><p>"Very well,'' was all she could trust herself to say. 
She concealed her anger beneath a careless smile and 
drove away.  How dense he was!  Could anything be 
more exasperating&mdash;or more disagreeable?  What 
<hi rend="italic">should</hi> she do?  The situation was intolerable; yet 
how 
could it be ended, except by a humiliating direct 
request for money?  She wondered how young wives 
habitually dealt with this problem, when they happened to 
marry husbands so negligent, not to say underbred, as 
to cause them the awkwardness and the shame.  There 
followed several days during which the money idea was 
an obsession, nagging and grinning at her every in-
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0106" n="93"/> 
stant.  The sight of money gave her a peculiar itching 
sensation.  When the little general paid for anything 
&mdash;always drawing out a great sheaf of bank notes in 
doing it&mdash;she flushed hot and cold, her glance fell 
guiltily and sought the money furtively.  At last her 
desperation gave birth to an inspiration. 
</p><p>About her and the general, or, rather, about the 
general, revolved the usual rich man's small army of 
satellites of various degrees&mdash;secretaries, butlers, 
footmen, valets, other servants male and female, some of 
them supposed to be devoted entirely to her service, but 
all in fact looking ever to the little general.  The 
members of this company, regardless of differences of rank 
and pay, were banded together in a sort of democratic 
fellowship, talking freely with one another, on terms 
of perfect equality.  She herself had, curiously, gotten 
on excellent terms with this motley fraternity and found 
no small relief from the strain of the general's formal 
dignity in talking with them with a freedom and ease 
she had never before felt in the society of underlings. 
The most conspicuous and most agreeable figure in this 
company was Harding, the general's factotum.  Why 
not lay the case before Harding?  He was notably 
sensible, and sympathetic&mdash;and discreet. 
</p><p>The following day she did so.  Said she, blushing 
furiously:  "Mr. Harding, I find myself in a very 
embarrassing position.  I wonder if you can help me?'' 
</p><p>Harding, a young man and of one of the best blond 
types, said:  "No doubt I can&mdash;and I'll be glad to.'' 
</p><p>"The fact is''&mdash;  Her voice was trembling with 
nervousness.  She opened the gold bag, took out the little 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0107" n="94"/> 
silver pieces and the big copper piece, extended her pink 
palm with them upon it&mdash;"there's all I've got left of 
the money I brought with me.'' 
</p><p>Harding gazed at the exhibit tranquilly.  He was 
chiefly remarkable for his perfect self-possession.  Said 
he:  "Do you wish me to cash a check for you?'' 
</p><p>The stupidity of men!  Tears of vexation gathered 
in her eyes.  When she could speak she faltered: 
</p><p>"No.'' 
</p><p>He was looking at her now&mdash;a grave, kind glance. 
</p><p>She somehow felt encouraged and heartened.  She 
went on:  "I was hoping&mdash;that&mdash;that the gen&mdash; 
that my husband had said something to you and that 
you perhaps had not thought to say anything to me.'' 
</p><p>Their glances met, his movingly sympathetic and 
understanding, hers piteously forlorn&mdash;the look of a 
lovely girl, stranded and friendless in a far strange 
land.  Presently he said gently: 
</p><p>"Yes, he told me to say something to you&mdash;if you 
should speak to me about this matter.''  His tone 
caused in her heart a horrible stillness of suspense.  He 
went on:  "He said&mdash;I give you his exact words: 
`If my wife should ask you for money, tell her my 
ideas on the subject.' '' 
</p><p>A pause.  She started up, crimson, her glance 
darting nervously this way and that to avoid his.  "Never 
mind.  Really, it's of no importance.  Thank you&mdash; 
I'll get on very well&mdash;I'm sorry to have troubled 
you&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"Pardon me, Mrs. Siddall,'' he interposed, "but I 
think you'd best let me finish.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0108" n="95"/> 
</p><p>She started to protest, she tried to move toward the 
door.  Her strength failed her, she sat down, waited, 
nervously clasping and unclasping the costly, jewel-embroidered bag. 
</p><p>"He has explained to me, many times,'' continued 
Harding, "that he believes women do not understand 
the value of money and ought not to be trusted with it. 
He proposes to provide everything for you, every 
comfort and luxury&mdash;I am using his own language, Mrs. 
Siddall&mdash;and he has open accounts at the principal 
shops in every city where you will go&mdash;New York, 
Washington, Chicago, Denver, Paris, London, Rome. 
He says you are at liberty to get practically anything 
you please at these shops, and he will pay the bills. 
He thus entirely spares you the necessity of ever spending 
any money.  Should you see anything you wish at 
some shop where he has no account, you can have it sent 
collect, and I or my assistant, Mr. Drawl, will settle 
for it.  All he asks is that you use discretion in this 
freedom.  He says it would be extremely painful to 
him to have to withdraw it.'' 
</p><p>Harding had pronounced this long speech in a dry 
monotonous voice, like one reading mechanically from 
a dull book.  As Mildred listened, her thoughts began 
to whirl about the central idea until she fell into a kind 
of stupor.  When he finished she was staring vacantly 
at the bag in her lap&mdash;the bag she was holding open 
wide. 
</p><p>Harding continued:  "He also instructed me to say 
something about his former&mdash;his experiences.  The 
first Mrs. Siddall he married when he was very young 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0109" n="96"/> 
and poor.  As he grew rich, she became madly extravagant. 
And as they had started on a basis on which she 
had free access to his money he could not check her. 
The result, finally, was a succession of bitter quarrels, 
and they were about to divorce when she died.  He 
made the second Mrs. Siddall an allowance, a liberal 
allowance.  Her follies compelled him to withdraw it. 
She resorted to underhanded means to get money from 
him without his knowing it.  He detected the fraud. 
After a series of disagreeable incidents she committed 
the indiscretion which caused him to divorce her.  He 
says that these experiences have convinced him that&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"The second Mrs. Siddall,'' interrupted Mildred, "is 
she still alive?'' 
</p><p>Harding hesitated.  "Yes,'' he said reluctantly. 
</p><p>"Is she&mdash;poor?'' asked Mildred. 
</p><p>"I should prefer not to&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"Did the general forbid you to tell me?'' 
</p><p>"On the contrary, he instructed me&mdash;  But I'd 
rather not talk about it, Mrs. Siddall.'' 
</p><p>"Is she poor?'' repeated Mildred. 
</p><p>"Yes.'' 
</p><p>"What became of her?'' 
</p><p>A long pause.  Then Harding said:  "She was a 
poor girl when the general married her.  After the 
divorce she lived for a while with the man.  But he had 
nothing.  They separated.  She tried various kinds of 
work&mdash;and other things.  Since she lost her looks&mdash; 
She writes from time to time, asking for money.'' 
</p><p>"Which she never gets?'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"Which she never gets,'' said Harding.  "Lately 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0110" n="97"/>
she was cashier or head waitress in a cheap restaurant 
in St. Louis.'' 
</p><p>After a long silence Mildred said:  "I understand. 
I understand.''  She drew a long breath.  "I shall 
understand better as time goes on, but I understand fairly 
well now.'' 
</p><p>"I need not tell you, Mrs. Siddall,'' said Harding in 
his gentle, tranquil way, "that the general is the kindest 
and most generous of men, but he has his own methods&mdash; 
as who has not?'' 
</p><p>Mildred had forgotten that he was there&mdash;not a 
difficult matter, when he had in its perfection the 
secretarial manner of complete self-effacement.  Said she 
reflectively, like one puzzling out a difficult problem: 
</p><p>"He buys a woman, as he buys a dog or a horse. 
He does not give his dog, his horse, pocket-money. 
Why should he give his woman pocket-money?'' 
</p><p>"Will it help matters, Mrs. Siddall, to go to the other 
extreme and do him a grave injustice?'' 
</p><p>She did not hear.  At the picture presented to her 
mind by her own thoughts she gave a short satirical 
laugh.  "How stupid of me not to have understood 
from the outset,'' said she.  "Why, I've often heard of 
this very thing.'' 
</p><p>"It is more and more the custom among men of large 
property, I believe,'' said Harding.  "Perhaps, Mrs. 
Siddall, you would not blame them if you were in their 
position.  The rich men who are careless&mdash;they ruin 
everybody about them, I assure you.  I've seen it again 
and again.'' 
</p><p>But the young wife was absorbed in her own 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0111" n="98"/>   
thoughts.  Harding, feeling her mood, did not interrupt. 
After a while she said: 
</p><p>"I must ask you some questions.  These jewels the 
general has been buying&mdash;'' 
</p><p>Harding made a movement of embarrassment and 
protest.  She smiled ironically and went on: 
</p><p>"One moment, please.  Every time I wish to wear 
any of them I have to go to him to get them.  He asks 
me to return them when I am undressing.  He says it 
is safer to keep everything in his strong box.  I have 
been assuming that that was the only reason.  I begin 
to suspect&mdash;  Am I right, Mr. Harding?'' 
</p><p>"Really I can't say, Mrs. Siddall,'' said Harding. 
"These are not matters to discuss with me, if you will 
permit me to say so.'' 
</p><p>"Oh, yes, they are,'' replied she laughingly. 
"Aren't we all in the same boat?&mdash;all employ&eacute;s of 
the general?'' 
</p><p>Harding made no reply. 
</p><p>Mildred was beside herself with a kind of rage that, 
because outlet was necessary and because raving against 
the little general would be absolutely futile, found outlet 
in self-mockery and reckless sarcasm. 
</p><p>"I understand about the jewels, too,'' she went on. 
"They are not mine.  Nothing is mine.  Everything, 
including myself, belongs to him.  If I give satisfaction 
in the position for which I've been hired for my board 
and clothes, I may continue to eat the general's food 
and sleep in the general's house and wear the general's 
jewels and dresses and ride in the general's traps and be 
waited on by the general's servants.  If I don't like my 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0112" n="99"/> 
place or he doesn't like my way of filling it''&mdash;she 
laughed merrily, mockingly&mdash;"out I go&mdash;into the 
streets&mdash;after the second Mrs. Siddall.  And the general 
will hire a new&mdash;''  She paused, cast about for a 
word in vain, appealed to the secretary, "What would 
you call it, Mr. Harding?'' 
</p><p>Harding rose, looking at her with a very soothing 
tranquillity.  "If I were you, Mrs. Siddall,'' said he, 
"I should get into the auto and go for a long drive&mdash; 
out to the Bois&mdash;out to Versailles&mdash;a long, long 
drive.  I should be gone four or five hours at least, and 
I should look at the thing from all sides.  Especially, 
I'd look at it from <hi rend="italic">his</hi> standpoint.'' 
</p><p>Mildred, somewhat quieter, but still mocking, said: 
"If I should decide to quit, would my expenses be paid 
back to where I was engaged?  I fancy not.'' 
</p><p>Harding looked grave.  "If you had had money 
enough to pay your own expenses about, would you 
have married him?'' said he.  "Isn't he paying&mdash;paying 
liberally, Mrs. Siddall&mdash;for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> he gets?'' 
</p><p>Mildred, stung, drew herself up haughtily, gave him 
a look that reminded him who she was and who he was. 
But Harding was not impressed. 
</p><p>"You said a moment ago&mdash;truly&mdash;that we are all 
in the same boat,'' observed he.  "I put those questions 
to you because I honestly wish to help you&mdash;because 
I wish you not to act foolishly, hastily.'' 
</p><p>"Thank you, Mr. Harding,'' said Mildred coldly. 
And with a slight nod she went, angry and ashamed 
that she had so unaccountably opened up her secret 
soul, bared its ugly wounds, before a man she knew so 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0113" n="100"/>  
slightly, a man in a position but one remove from 
menial.  However, she took his advice&mdash;not as to trying 
to view the matter from all sides, for she was 
convinced that there was only the one side, but as to 
calming herself by a long drive alone in the woods and 
along quiet roads.  When she returned she was under 
control once more. 
</p><p>She found the general impatiently awaiting her. 
Many packages had come&mdash;from the jewelers, from 
the furriers, from a shop whose specialty was the 
thinnest and most delicate of hand-made underwear.  The 
general loved to open and inspect finery for her&mdash; 
loved it more than he loved inspecting finery for 
himself, because feminine finery was far more attractive 
than masculine.  To whet his pleasure to the keenest 
she must be there to admire with him, to try on, to 
exhibit.  As she entered the salon where the little man 
was fussing about among the packages, their glances 
met.  She saw that Harding had told him&mdash;at least in 
discreet outline&mdash;of their conversation.  She also saw 
that if she reopened the subject she would find herself 
straightway whirled out upon a stormy sea of danger 
that might easily overwhelm her flimsy boat.  She 
silently and sullenly dropped into her place; she 
ministered to the general's pleasure in packages of finery. 
But she did not exclaim, or admire, or respond in any 
way.  The honeymoon was over.  Her dream of wifehood 
was dissipated. 
</p><p>She understood now the look she so often had seen 
on the faces of rich men's poor wives driving in state 
in Fifth Avenue.  That night, as she inspected herself 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0114" n="101"/> 
in the glass while the general's maid for her brushed 
her long thick hair, she saw the beginnings of that look 
in her own face.  "I don't know just what I am,'' she 
said to herself.  "But I do know what I am not.  I am 
not a wife.'' 
</p><p>She sent away the maid, and sat there in the dressing-room before the mirror, waiting, her glance traveling 
about and noting the profuse and prodigal luxury.  In 
the corner stood a circular rack loaded with dressing-gowns&mdash;more than a score of exquisite combinations 
of silk and lace or silk and chiffon.  It so happened 
that there was nowhere in sight a single article of her 
apparel or for her toilet that was not bought with 
the general's money.  No, there were some hairpins 
that she had paid for herself, and a comb with widely 
separated teeth that she had chanced to see in a 
window when she was alone one day.  Anything else? 
Yes, a two-franc box of pins.  And that was all. 
Everything else belonged to the general.  In the closets, 
in the trunks&mdash;all the general's, part of the trousseau 
he had paid for.  Not an undergarment; not an outer 
garment; not a hat or a pair of shoes, not a wrap, not 
a pair of gloves.  All, the general's. 
</p><p>He was in the door of the dressing-room&mdash;the small 
wiry figure in rose-silk pajamas.  The mustache and 
imperial were carefully waxed as always, day and night. 
On the little feet were high-heeled slippers.  On the 
head was a rose-silk Neapolitan nightcap with gay tassel. 
The nightcap hid the bald spot from which the lofty 
toupee had been removed.  A grotesque little figure, 
but not grotesque to her.  Through the mask of the 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0115" n="102"/> 
vain, boastful little face she saw the general watching 
her, as she had seen him that afternoon when she came 
in&mdash;the mysterious and terrible personality that had 
made the vast fortune, that had ridden ruthlessly over 
friend and foe, over man and woman and child&mdash;to the 
goal of its desires. 
</p><p>"It's late, my dear?'' said the little man.  "Come 
to bed.'' 
</p><p>She rose to obey&mdash;she in the general's purchases of 
filmy nightgown under a pale-pink silk dressing-gown. 
</p><p>He smiled with that curious noiseless mumbling and 
smacking of the thin lips.  She sat down again. 
</p><p>"Don't keep me waiting.  It's chilly,'' he said, 
advancing toward her. 
</p><p>"I shall sleep in here to-night&mdash;on the couch,'' said 
she.  She was trembling with fright at her own audacity. 
She could see a fifty-centime piece and a copper 
dancing before her eyes.  She felt horribly alone and 
weak, but she had no desire to retract the words with 
which she had thrown down the gauntlet. 
</p><p>The little general halted.  The mask dropped; the 
man, the monster, looked at her.  "What's the matter?'' 
said he in an ominously quiet voice. 
</p><p>"Mr. Harding delivered your message to-day,'' said 
she, and her steady voice astonished her.  "So I am 
going back home.'' 
</p><p>He waited, looking steadily at her. 
</p><p>"After he told me and I thought about it, I decided 
to submit, but just now I saw that I couldn't.  I don't 
know what possesses me.  I don't know what I'm going 
to do, or how I'm going to do it.  But it's all over 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0116" n="103"/>
between us.''  She said this rapidly, fluently, in a 
decisive way, quite foreign to her character as she had 
thought it. 
</p><p>"You are coming to bed, where you belong,'' said 
he quietly. 
</p><p>"No,'' replied she, pressing herself against her chair 
as if force were being used to drag her from it.  She 
cast about for something that would make yielding 
impossible.  "You are&mdash;repulsive to me.'' 
</p><p>He looked at her without change of countenance. 
Said he:  "Come to bed.  I ask you for the last time.'' 
</p><p>There was no anger in his voice, no menace either 
open or covert; simply finality&mdash;the last word of the 
man who had made himself feared and secure in the 
mining-camps where the equation of personal courage is 
straightway applied to every situation.  Mildred 
shivered.  She longed to yield, to stammer out some excuse 
and obey him.  But she could not; nor was she able 
to rise from her chair.  She saw in his hard eyes a look 
of astonishment, of curiosity as to this unaccountable 
defiance in one who had seemed docile, who had 
apparently no alternative but obedience.  He was not so 
astonished at her as she was at herself.  "What is to 
become of me?'' her terror-stricken soul was crying. 
"I must do as he says&mdash;I must&mdash;yet I cannot!'' 
And she looked at him and sat motionless. 
</p><p>He turned away, moved slowly toward the door, 
halted at the threshold to give her time, was gone.  A 
fit of trembling seized her; she leaned forward and 
rested her arms upon the dressing-table or she would 
have fallen from the chair to the floor.  Yet, even as 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0117" n="104"/> 
her fear made her sick and weak, she knew that she 
would not yield. 
</p><p>The cold drove her to the couch, to lie under half a 
dozen of the dressing-gowns and presently to fall into 
a sleep of exhaustion.  When she awoke after what she 
thought was a few minutes of unconsciousness, the 
clamor of traffic in the Rue de Rivoli startled her.  She 
started up, glanced at the clock on the chimneypiece. 
It was ten minutes past nine!  When, by all the rules 
governing the action of the nerves, she ought to have 
passed a wakeful night she had overslept more than an 
hour.  Indeed, she had had the first sound and prolonged 
sleep that had come to her since the honeymoon 
began; for until then she had slept alone all her life 
and the new order had almost given her chronic insomnia. 
She rang for her maid and began to dress.  The 
maid did not come.  She rang again and again; 
apparently the bell was broken.  She finished dressing and 
went out into the huge, grandly and gaudily furnished 
salon.  Harding was at a carved old-gold and lacquer 
desk, writing.  As she entered he rose and bowed. 
</p><p>"Won't you please call one of the servants?'' said 
she.  "I want my coffee.  I guess the bell in my room 
is broken.  My maid doesn't answer.'' 
</p><p>"No, the bell is not broken,'' said Harding. 
</p><p>She looked at him questioningly. 
</p><p>"The general has issued an order that nothing is 
to be done in this apartment, and nothing served, unless 
he personally authorizes it.'' 
</p><p>Mildred paled, drew herself up in what seemed a 
gesture of haughtiness but was an effort to muster her 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0118" n="105"/> 
strength.  To save herself from the humiliation of a 
breakdown before him, she hastily retreated by the way 
she had come.  After perhaps a quarter of an hour she 
reappeared in the salon; she was now dressed for the 
street.  Harding looked up from his writing, rose and 
bowed gravely.  Said she: 
</p><p>"I am going out for a walk.  I'll be back in an hour 
or so.'' 
</p><p>"One moment,'' said Harding, halting her as she was 
opening the door into the public hall.  "The general 
has issued an order that if you go out, you are not to be 
allowed to return.'' 
</p><p>Her hand fell from the knob.  With flashing eyes 
she cried, "But that is impossible!'' 
</p><p>"It is his orders,'' said Harding, in his usual quiet 
manner.  "And as he pays the bills he will be 
obeyed.'' 
</p><p>She debated.  Against her will, her trembling hand 
sought the knob again.  Against her will, her weak arm 
began to draw the door open.  Harding came toward 
her, stood before her and looked directly into her eyes. 
His eyes had dread and entreaty in them, but his voice 
was as always when he said: 
</p><p>"You know him, Mrs. Siddall.'' 
</p><p>"Yes,'' she said. 
</p><p>"The reason he has got <hi rend="italic">all</hi> he 
wanted&mdash;whatever he 
wanted&mdash;is that he will go to any length.  Every other 
human being, almost, has a limit, beyond which they will 
not go&mdash;a physical fear or a moral fear or a fear of 
public opinion.  But the general&mdash;he has no limit.'' 
</p><p>"Yes,'' she said.  And deathly pale and almost stag-
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0119" n="106"/>   
gering she drew open the door and went out into the 
public hall. 
</p><p>"For God's sake, Mrs. Siddall!'' cried Harding, in 
great agitation.  "Come in quickly.  They are watching&mdash; 
they will tell him!  Are you mad?'' 
</p><p>"I think I must be,'' said she.  "I am sick with fear. 
I can hardly keep from dropping down here in a faint. 
Yet&mdash;'' a strange look, a mingling of abject terror 
and passionate defiance, gave her an aspect quite insane 
&mdash;"I am going.  Perhaps I, too, have no limit.'' 
</p><p>And she went along the corridor, past a group of 
gaping and frightened servants, down the stairway and 
out by the private entrance for the grand apartments 
of the hotel in the Rue Raymond de l'Isle.  She crossed 
the Rue de Rivoli and entered the Tuileries Gardens. 
It was only bracingly cool in the sunshine of that 
winter day.  She seated herself on a chair on the 
terrace to regain her ebbed strength.  Hardly had she 
sat down when the woman collector came and stood waiting 
for the two sous for the chair.  Mildred opened her 
bag, found two coins.  She gave the coppers to the 
woman.  The other&mdash;all the money she had&mdash;was the 
fifty-centime piece. 
</p><p>"But the bag&mdash;I can get a good deal for that,'' she 
said aloud. 
</p><p>"I beg your pardon&mdash;I didn't catch that.'' 
</p><p>She came back to a sense of her surroundings.  Stanley 
Baird was standing a few feet away, smiling down 
at her.  He was, if possible, even more attractively 
dressed than in the days when he hovered about her, 
hoping vague things of which he was ashamed and try-
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0120" n="107"/>
ing to get the courage to put down his snobbishness and 
marry her because she so exactly suited him.  He was 
wearing a new kind of collar and tie, striking yet in 
excellent quiet taste.  Also, his face and figure had filled 
out just enough&mdash;he had been too thin in the former 
days.  But he was now entered upon that period of the 
fearsome forties when, unless a man amounts to something, 
he begins to look insignificant.  He did not 
amount to anything; he was therefore paling and waning 
as a personality. 
</p><p>"Was I thinking aloud?'' said Mildred, as she gave 
him her hand. 
</p><p>"You said something about `getting a good deal.' '' 
He inspected her with the freedom of an old friend and 
with the thoroughness of a connoisseur.  Women who 
took pains with themselves and were satisfied with the 
results liked Stanley Baird's knowing and appreciative 
way of noting the best points in their toilets.  "You're 
looking fine,'' declared he.  "It must be a pleasure to 
them up in the Rue de la Paix to dress you.  That's 
more than can be said for nine out of ten of the women 
who go there.  Yes, you're looking fine&mdash;and in grand 
health, too.  Why, you look younger than I ever saw 
you.  Nothing like marriage to freshen a girl up. 
Well, I suppose waiting round for a husband who may 
or may not turn up does wear a woman down.'' 
</p><p>"It almost killed me,'' laughed Mildred.  "And you 
were largely responsible.'' 
</p><p>"I?'' said Baird.  "You didn't want me.  I was too 
old for you.'' 
</p><p>"No, I didn't want you,'' said Mildred.  "But you 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0121" n="108"/>  
spoiled me.  I couldn't endure the boys of my own 
age.'' 
</p><p>Stanley was remembering that Mildred had married 
a man much older than he.  With some notion of a careless 
sort of tact in mind he said, "I was betwixt and 
between&mdash;neither young enough nor old enough.'' 
</p><p>"You've married, too, since we met.  By the way, 
thank you again for that charming remembrance. 
You always did have such good taste.  But why 
didn't you come to the wedding&mdash;you and your 
wife?'' 
</p><p>He laughed.  "We were busy busting up,'' said he. 
"You hadn't heard?  It's been in the papers.  She's 
gone back to her people.  Oh, nothing disgraceful on 
either side.  Simply that we bored each other to death. 
She was crazy about horses and dogs, and that set.  I 
think the stable's the place for horses&mdash;don't care to 
have 'em parading through the house all the time, every 
room, every meal, sleeping and waking.  And dogs&mdash; 
the infernal brutes always have fleas.  Fleas only tickled 
her, but they bite me&mdash;raise welts and hills.  There's 
your husband now, isn't it?'' 
</p><p>Baird was looking up at the windows of the 
Continental, across the street.  Mildred's glance slowly and 
carelessly followed his.  At one window stood the little 
general, gazing abstractedly out over the gardens.  At 
another window Mildred saw Harding; at a third, her 
maid; at a fourth, Harding's assistant, Drawl; at a 
fifth, three servants of the retinue.  Except the general, 
all were looking at her. 
</p><p>"You've married a very extraordinary man,'' said 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0122" n="109"/>
Baird, in a correct tone of admiration.  "One of the 
ablest and most interesting men we've got, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> 
think.'' 
</p><p>"So you are free again?'' said Mildred, looking at 
him with a queer, cold smile. 
</p><p>"Yes, and no,'' replied Stanley.  "I hope to be 
entirely free.  It's her move next.  I'm expecting it 
every day.  But I'm thoroughly respectable.  Won't 
you and the general dine with me?'' 
</p><p>"Thanks, but I'm sailing for home to-morrow or 
next day.'' 
</p><p>"That's interesting,'' said Baird, with enthusiasm. 
"So am I.  What ship do you go on?'' 
</p><p>"I don't know yet.  I'm to decide this afternoon, 
after lunch.''  She laughed.  "I'm sitting here waiting 
for someone to ask me to lunch.  I've not had even 
coffee yet.'' 
</p><p>"Lunch with me!'' cried Baird.  "I'll go get the 
general&mdash;I know him slightly.'' 
</p><p>"I didn't say anything about the general,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>Stanley smiled apologetically.  "It wouldn't do for 
you to go about with me&mdash;not when my missus is looking 
for grounds for divorce.'' 
</p><p>"Why not?'' said Mildred.  "So's my husband.'' 
</p><p>"You busted up, too?  Now, that's what <hi rend="italic">I</hi> 
call 
jolly.''  And he cast a puzzled glance up at the 
abstracted general.  "I say, Mildred, this is no place for 
either of us, is it?'' 
</p><p>"I'd rather be where there's food,'' confessed she. 
</p><p>"You think it's a joke, but I assure you&mdash;  Oh, 
you <hi rend="italic">were</hi> joking&mdash;about <hi rend="italic">your</hi> bust-up?'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0123" n="110"/>  
</p><p>"No, indeed,'' she assured him.  "I walked out a 
while ago, and I couldn't go back if I would&mdash;and I 
don't think I would if I could.'' 
</p><p>"That's foolish.  Better go back,'' advised he.  He 
was preparing hastily to decamp from so perilous a 
neighborhood.  "One marriage is about like another, 
once you get through the surface.  I'm sure you'll be 
better off than&mdash;back with your stepfather.'' 
</p><p>"I've no intention of going to his house,'' she declared. 
"Oh, there's your brother.  I forgot.'' 
</p><p>"So had I forgotten him.  I'll not go there, either. 
In fact, I've not thought where I'll go.'' 
</p><p>"You seem to have done mighty little thinking before 
you took a very serious step for a woman.''  He 
was uneasily eying the rigid, abstracted little figure a 
story up across the way. 
</p><p>"Those things aren't a question of thinking,'' said 
she absently.  "I never thought in my life&mdash;don't 
think I could if I tried.  But when the time came I&mdash; 
I walked out.''  She came back to herself, laughed. 
"I don't understand why I'm telling you all this, 
especially as you're mad with fright and wild to get away. 
Well, good-by, Stanley.'' 
</p><p>He lifted his hat.  "Good-by.  We'll meet when we 
can do so without my getting a scandal on you.''  He 
walked a few paces, turned, and came back.  "By the 
way, I'm sailing on the <hi rend="italic">Deutschland</hi>.  I thought you'd 
like to know&mdash;so that you and I wouldn't by any 
chance cross on the same boat.'' 
</p><p>"Thanks,'' said she dryly. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0124" n="111"/>  
</p><p>"What's the matter?'' asked he, arrested, despite his 
anxiety to be gone, by the sad, scornful look in her 
eyes. 
</p><p>"Nothing.  Why?'' 
</p><p>"You had such a&mdash;such a queer look.'' 
</p><p>"Really?  Good-by.'' 
</p><p>In fact, she had thought&mdash;had hoped for the sake 
of her liking for him&mdash;that he had come back to make 
the glaringly omitted offer of help that should have 
come from any human being learning that a fellow 
being was in the precarious position in which she had told 
him she was.  Not that she would have accepted any 
such offer.  Still, she would have liked to have heard the 
kindly words.  She sat watching his handsome, graceful 
figure, draped in the most artistically cut of long 
dark overcoats, until he disappeared in the crowd in 
the Rue de Castiglione.  Then, without a glance up 
at the interested, not to say excited windows of the 
general's splendid and spreading apartments, she 
strolled down the gardens toward the Place Concorde. 
In Paris the beautiful, on a bright and brisk day it is 
all but impossible to despair when one still has left 
youth and health.  Mildred was not happy&mdash;far from 
it.  The future, the immediate future, pressed its 
terrors upon her.  But in mitigation there was, perhaps 
born of youth and inexperience, a giddy sense of relief. 
She had not realized how abhorrent the general was&mdash; 
married life with the general.  She had been resigning 
herself to it, accepting it as the only thing possible, 
keeping it heavily draped with her vanities of wealth 
and luxury&mdash;until she discovered that the wealth and 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0125" n="112"/>  
the luxury were in reality no more hers than they were 
her maid's.  And now she was free! 
</p><p>That word free did not have its full meaning for her. 
She had never known what real freedom was; women 
of the comfortable class&mdash;and men, too, for that matter&mdash; 
usually are born into the petty slavery of conventions 
at least, and know nothing else their whole lives 
through&mdash;never know the joy of the thought and the 
act of a free mind and a free heart.  Still, she was 
released from a bondage that seemed slavish even to her, 
and the release gave her a sensation akin to the joy of 
freedom.  A heavy hand that was crushing her very 
soul had been lifted off&mdash;no, <hi rend="italic">flung</hi> off, and by 
herself. 
That thought, terrifying though it was, also gave her 
a certain new and exalting self-respect.  After all, she 
was not a worm.  She must have somewhere in her the 
germs of something less contemptible than the essential 
character of so many of the eminently respectable 
women she knew.  She could picture them in the situation 
in which she had found herself.  What would they 
have done?  Why, what every instinct of her education 
impelled her to do; what some latent love of freedom, 
some unsuspected courage of self-respect had forbidden 
her to do, had withheld her from doing. 
</p><p>Her thoughts and the gorgeous sunshine and her 
youth and health put her in a steadily less cheerless 
mood as by a roundabout way she sought the shop of the 
jeweler who sold the general the gold bag she had 
selected.  The proprietor himself was in the front part 
of the shop and received "Madame la Generale'' with 
all the honors of her husband's wealth.  She brought 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0126" n="113"/>
no experience and no natural trading talent to the 
enterprise she was about to undertake; so she went 
directly to the main point. 
</p><p>"This bag,'' said she, laying it upon the glass 
between them, "I bought it here a short time ago.'' 
</p><p>"I remember perfectly, madame.  It is the handsomest, 
the most artistic, we have sold this year.'' 
</p><p>"I wish to sell it back to you,'' said she. 
</p><p>"You wish to get something else and include it as 
part payment, madame?'' 
</p><p>"No, I wish to get the money for it.'' 
</p><p>"Ah, but that is difficult.  We do not often make 
those arrangements.  Second-hand articles&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"But the bag is quite new.  Anyhow, it must have 
some value.  Of course I'd not expect the full price.'' 
</p><p>The jeweler smiled.  "The full price?  Ah, madame, 
we should not think of offering it again as it is. 
We should&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"No matter,'' interrupted Mildred.  The man's 
expression&mdash;the normally pleasant and agreeable countenance 
turned to repulsive by craft and lying&mdash;made 
her eager to be gone.  "What is the most you will 
give me?'' 
</p><p>"I shall have to consider&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"I've only a few minutes.  Please do not irritate 
me.'' 
</p><p>The man was studying her countenance with a 
desperate look.  Why was she, the bride of the monstrously 
rich American, why was she trying to sell the 
bag?  Did it mean the end of her resources?  Or, were 
there still huge orders to be got from her?  His shrewd-
      <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0127" n="114"/>    
ness, trained by thirty years of dealing with all kinds of 
luxurious human beings, went exploring in vain.  He 
was alarmed by her frown.  He began hesitatingly: 
</p><p>"The jewels and the gold are only a small part of 
the value.  The chief value is the unique design, so 
elegant yet so simple.  For the jewels and the gold, 
perhaps two thousand francs&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"The purse was twelve thousand francs,'' interrupted 
she. 
</p><p>"Perfectly, madame.  But&mdash;'' 
"I am in great haste.  How much will you give me?'' 
</p><p>"The most would be four thousand, I fear.  I shall 
count up more carefully, if madame will&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"No, four thousand will do.'' 
</p><p>"I will send the money to madame at her hotel.  The 
Continental, is it not?'' 
</p><p>"No, I must have it at once.'' 
</p><p>The jeweler hesitated.  Mildred, flushing scarlet with 
shame&mdash;but he luckily thought it anger&mdash;took up the 
bag and moved toward the door. 
</p><p>"Pardon, madame, but certainly.  Do you wish 
some gold or all notes?'' 
</p><p>"Notes,'' answered she.  "Fifty and hundred-franc 
notes.'' 
</p><p>A moment later she was in the street with the notes 
in a small bundle in the bosom of her wrap.  She went 
hurriedly up the street.  As she was about to turn the 
corner into the boulevard she on impulse glanced back. 
An automobile had just drawn up at the jeweler's door 
and General Siddall&mdash;top-hat, sable-lined overcoat, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0128" n="115"/>
waxed mustache and imperial, high-heeled boots, gold-mounted cane&mdash;was descending.  And she knew that 
he had awakened to his one oversight, and was on his 
way to repair it.  But she did not know that the jeweler 
&mdash;old and wise in human ways&mdash;would hastily vanish 
with the bag and that an assistant would come forward 
with assurances that madame had not been in the shop 
and that, if she should come in, no business would be 
negotiated without the general's express consent.  She 
all but fainted at the narrowness of her escape and fled 
round into the boulevard.  She entered a taxi and told 
the man to drive to Foyot's restaurant on the left bank 
&mdash;where the general would never think of looking for 
her. 
</p><p>When she had breakfasted she strolled in the Luxembourg 
Gardens, in even better humor with herself and 
with the world.  There was still that horrid-faced 
future, but it was not leering into her very face.  It 
was nearly four thousand francs away&mdash;"and if I 
hadn't been so stupid, I'd have got eight thousand, I'm 
sure,'' she said.  But she was rather proud of a stupidity 
about money matters.  And four thousand francs, 
eight hundred dollars&mdash;that was quite a good sum. 
</p><p>She had an instinct that the general would do 
something disagreeable about the French and English ports 
of departure for America.  But perhaps he would not 
think of the Italian ports.  That night she set out for 
Genoa, and three days later, in a different dress and 
with her hair done as she never wore it, sailed as Miss 
Mary Stevens for America on a German Mediterranean 
boat. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0129" n="116"/>    
</p><p>She had taken the whole of a cabin on the quieter 
deck below the promenade, paying for it nearly half 
of what was left of the four thousand francs.  The 
first three days she kept to her cabin except at the 
dinner-hour, when she ventured to the deck just outside 
and walked up and down for exercise.  Then followed 
four days of nasty weather during which she did not 
leave her bed.  As the sea calmed, she, wretched and 
reckless, had a chair put for herself under her window 
and sat there, veiled and swathed and turning her face 
away whenever a rare wandering passenger happened 
to pass along.  Toward noon a man paused before her 
to light a cigarette.  She, forgetting for the moment 
her precautions, looked at him.  It chanced that he 
looked at her at exactly the same instant.  Their 
glances met.  He started nervously, moved on a few 
steps, returned.  Said she mockingly: 
</p><p>"You know you needn't speak if you don't want to, 
Stanley.'' 
</p><p>"There isn't a soul on board that anybody ever 
knew or that ever knew anybody,'' said he.  "So why 
not?'' 
</p><p>"And you look horribly bored.'' 
</p><p>"Unspeakably,'' replied Baird.  "I've spoken to no 
one since I left Paris.'' 
</p><p>"What are you doing on this ship?'' inquired she. 
</p><p>"To be perfectly honest,'' said he, "I came this way 
to avoid you.  I was afraid you'd take passage on my 
steamer just to amuse yourself with my nervousness. 
And&mdash;here you are!'' 
</p><p>"Amusing myself with your nervousness.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0130" n="117"/> 
</p><p>"But I'm not nervous.  There's no danger.  Will 
you let me have a chair put beside yours?'' 
</p><p>"It will be a charity on your part,'' said she. 
</p><p>When he was comfortably settled, he explained his 
uneasiness.  "I see I've got to tell you,'' said he, "for 
I don't want you to think me a shouting ass.  The fact 
is my wife wants to get a divorce from me and to soak 
me for big alimony.  She's a woman who'll do anything 
to gain her end, and&mdash;well, for some reason she's always 
been jealous of you.  I didn't care to get into 
trouble, or to get you into trouble.'' 
</p><p>"I'm traveling as Mary Stevens,'' said Mildred. 
"No one knows I'm aboard.'' 
</p><p>"Oh, I'm sure we're quite safe.  We can enjoy the 
rest of this voyage.'' 
</p><p>A sea voyage not merely induces but compels a 
feeling of absolute detachment from the world.  To both 
Stanley and Mildred their affairs&mdash;the difficulties in 
which they were involved on terra firma&mdash;ceased for 
the time to have any reality.  The universe was nothing 
but a vast stretch of water under a vast stretch 
of sky; the earth and the things thereof were a retrospect 
and a foreboding.  Without analyzing it, both 
he and she felt that they were free&mdash;free from cares, 
from responsibilities&mdash;free to amuse themselves.  And 
they proceeded to enjoy themselves in the necessarily 
quiet and limited way imposed by the littleness of 
their present world and the meagerness of the 
resources. 
</p><p>As neither had the kind of mind that expands in 
abstractions, they were soon talking in the most intimate 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0131" n="118"/> 
and personal way about themselves&mdash;were confessing 
things which neither would have breathed to anyone 
on land.  It was the man who set the example of breaking 
through the barriers of conventional restraint&mdash; 
perhaps of delicacy, though it must be said that human 
beings are rarely so fine in their reticences as the theory 
of refinement would have us believe.  Said Stanley, 
after the preliminaries of partial confidence and halting 
avowal that could not be omitted, even at sea, by a man 
of "gentlemanly instinct'': 
</p><p>"I don't know why I shouldn't own up.  I know 
you'll never tell anybody.  Fact is, I and my wife were 
never in love with each other for a second.  We married 
because we were in the same set and because our incomes 
together gave us enough to do the thing rather well.'' 
After a solemn pause.  "I was in love with another 
woman&mdash;one I couldn't marry.  But I'll not go into 
that.  As for my wife, I don't think she was in love 
with anyone.  She's as cold as a stone.'' 
</p><p>Mildred smiled ironically. 
</p><p>Baird saw and flushed.  "At least, she was to me. 
I was ready to make a sort of bluff.  You see, a man 
feels guilty in those circumstances and doesn't want 
to humiliate a woman.  But she&mdash;'' he laughed 
unpleasantly&mdash;"she wasn't bothering about <hi rend="italic">my</hi> 
feelings. 
That's a nice, selfish little way you ladies have.'' 
</p><p>"She probably saw through you and hated you for 
playing the hypocrite to her,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"You may be right, I never thought of that,'' 
confessed he.  "She certainly had a vicious way of 
hammering the other woman indirectly.  Not that she ever 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0132" n="119"/>   
admitted being jealous.  I guess she knew.  Everybody 
usually knows everything.'' 
</p><p>"And there was a great deal of talk about you and 
me,'' said Mildred placidly. 
</p><p>"I didn't say it was you,'' protested Stanley, reddening. 
</p><p>"No matter,'' said Mildred.  "Don't bother about 
that.  It's all past and gone.'' 
</p><p>"Well, at any rate, my marriage was the mistake of 
my life.  I'm determined that she shan't trip me up and 
trim me for any alimony.  And as matters stand, she 
can't.  She left me of her own accord.'' 
</p><p>"Then,'' said Mildred thoughtfully, "if the wife 
leaves of her own accord, she can't get alimony?'' 
</p><p>"Certainly not&mdash;not a cent.'' 
</p><p>"I supposed so,'' said she.  "I'm not sure I'd take it 
if I could get it.  Still, I suppose I would.''  She 
laughed.  "What's the use of being a hypocrite with 
oneself?  I know I would.  All I could get.'' 
</p><p>"Then you had no <hi rend="italic">legal</hi> excuse for 
leaving?'' 
</p><p>"No,'' said she.  "I&mdash;just bolted.  I don't know 
what's to become of me.  I seem not to care, at present, 
but no doubt I shall as soon as we see land again.'' 
</p><p>"You'll go back to him,'' said Stanley. 
</p><p>"No,'' replied she, without emphasis or any accent 
whatever. 
</p><p>"Sure you will,'' rejoined he.  "It's your living. 
What else can you do?'' 
</p><p>"That's what I must find out.  Surely there's 
something else for a woman besides such a married life as 
mine.  I can't and won't go back to my husband.  And 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0133" n="120"/> 
I can't and won't go to the house at Hanging Rock. 
Those two things are settled.'' 
</p><p>"You mean that?'' 
</p><p>"Absolutely.  And I've got&mdash;less than three hundred 
and fifty dollars in the whole world.'' 
</p><p>Baird was silent.  He was roused from his abstraction 
by gradual consciousness of an ironical smile on 
the face of the girl, for she did not look like a married 
woman.  "You are laughing at me.  Why?'' inquired 
he. 
</p><p>"I was reading your thoughts.'' 
</p><p>"You think you've frightened me?'' 
</p><p>"Naturally.  Isn't a confession such as I made 
enough to frighten a man?  It sounded as though I 
were getting ready to ask alms.'' 
</p><p>"So it did,'' said he.  "But I wasn't thinking of it 
in that way.  You <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be in a frightful fix pretty 
soon, 
won't you?'' 
</p><p>"It looks that way.  But you need not be uneasy.'' 
</p><p>"Oh, I want to help you.  I'll do everything I can. 
I was trying to think of something you could make 
money at.  I was thinking of the stage, but I suppose 
you'd balk at that.  I'll admit it isn't the life for a 
lady.  But the same thing's true of whatever money 
can be made at.  If I were you, I'd go back.'' 
</p><p>"If I were myself, I'd go back,'' said Mildred. 
"But I'm not myself.'' 
</p><p>"You will be again, as soon as you face the situation.'' 
</p><p>"No,'' said she slowly, "no, I shall never be myself 
again.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0134" n="121"/> 
</p><p>"But you could have everything a woman wants. 
Except, of course&mdash;perhaps&mdash;  But you never struck 
me as being especially sentimental.'' 
</p><p>"Sentiment has nothing to do with it,'' rejoined she. 
"Do you think I could get a place on the stage?'' 
</p><p>"Oh, you'd have to study a while, I suppose.'' 
</p><p>"But I can't afford that.  If I could afford to study, 
I'd have my voice trained.'' 
</p><p>Baird's face lighted up with enthusiasm.  "The very 
thing!'' he cried.  "You've got a voice, a grand-opera 
voice.  I've heard lots of people say so, and it sounded 
that way to me.  You must cultivate your voice.'' 
</p><p>Mildred laughed.  "Don't talk nonsense.  Even I 
know that's nonsense.  The lessons alone would cost 
thousands of dollars.  And how could I live for the 
four or five years?'' 
</p><p>"You didn't let me finish,'' said Baird.  "I was 
going to say that when you get to New York you must 
go and have your voice passed on&mdash;by some impartial 
person.  If that person says it's worth cultivating, why, 
I'm willing to back you&mdash;as a business proposition. 
I can afford to take the risk.  So, you see, it's all 
perfectly simple.'' 
</p><p>He had spoken rapidly, with a covert suggestion of 
fear lest she would rebuke him sharply for what she 
might regard as an impertinent offer.  She surprised 
him by looking at him calmly, reflectively, and saying: 
</p><p>"Yes, you could afford it, couldn't you?'' 
</p><p>"I'm sure I could.  And it's the sort of thing that's 
done every day.  Of course, no one'd know that we had 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0135" n="122"/>    
made this little business arrangement.  But that's easily 
managed.  I'd be glad if you'd let me do it, Mildred. 
I'd like to feel that I was of some use in the world. 
And I'd like to do something for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>.'' 
</p><p>By way of exceedingly cautious experiment he 
ventured to put ever so slight an accent of tenderness upon 
the "you.''  He observed her furtively but nervously. 
He could not get a hint of what was in her mind.  She 
gazed out toward the rising and falling horizon line. 
Presently she said: 
</p><p>"I'll think about it.'' 
</p><p>"You must let me do it, Mildred.  It's the sensible 
thing&mdash;and you know me well enough to know that 
my friendship can be counted on.'' 
</p><p>"I'll think about it,'' was all she would concede. 
</p><p>They discussed the singing career all that and the 
succeeding days&mdash;the possibilities, the hopes, the dangers&mdash; 
but the hopes a great deal more than the dangers. 
He became more and more interested in her and 
in the project, as her beauty shone out with the 
tranquillizing sea and as her old charm of cleverness at 
saying things that amused him reasserted itself.  She, 
dubious and lukewarm at first, soon was trying to curb 
her own excited optimism; but long before they sighted 
Sandy Hook she was merely pretending to hang back. 
He felt discouraged by her parting!  "If I decide to 
go on, I'll write you in a few days.''  But he need not 
have felt so.  She had made up her mind to accept his 
offer.  As for the complications involved in such curiously 
intimate relations with a man of his temperament, 
habits, and inclinations, she saw them very vaguely indeed &mdash; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0136" n="123"/> 
refused to permit herself to see them any less 
vaguely.  Time enough to deal with complications 
when and as they arose; why needlessly and foolishly 
annoy herself and hamper herself?  Said she to herself, 
"I must begin to be practical.'' </p>

<p>AT the pier Mildred sent her mother a telegram, 
giving the train by which she would arrive&mdash;that and 
nothing more.  As she descended from the parlor-car 
there stood Mrs. Presbury upon the platform, face 
wreathed in the most joyous of welcoming smiles, not 
a surface trace of the curiosity and alarm storming 
within.  After they had kissed and embraced with a 
genuine emotion which they did not try to hide, because 
both suddenly became unconscious of that world whereof 
ordinarily they were constantly mindful&mdash;after caresses 
and tears Mrs. Presbury said: 
</p><p>"It's all very well to dress plain, when everyone 
knows you can afford the best.  But don't you think 
you're overdoing it a little?'' 
</p><p>Mildred laughed somewhat nervously.  "Wait till 
we're safe at home,'' said she. 
</p><p>On the way up from the station in the carriage they 
chattered away in the liveliest fashion, to make the 
proper impression upon any observing Hanging-Rockers.  "Luckily, Presbury's gone to town to-day,'' 
said his wife.  "But really he's quite livable&mdash;hasn't 
gone back to his old ways.  He doesn't know it, but 
he's rapidly growing deaf.  He imagines that everyone 
is speaking more and more indistinctly, and he has 
lost interest in conversation.  Then, too, he has done 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0138" n="125"/>   
well in Wall Street, and that has put him in a good 
humor.'' 
</p><p>"He'll not be surprised to see me&mdash;alone,'' said 
Mildred. 
</p><p>"Wait till we're home,'' said her mother nervously. 
</p><p>At the house Mrs. Presbury carried on a foolish, 
false-sounding conversation for the benefit of the servants, 
and finally conducted Mildred to her bedroom and 
shut doors and drew porti&egrave;res and glanced into closets 
before saying:  "Now, what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the matter, Millie? 
<hi rend="italic">Where</hi> is your husband?'' 
</p><p>"In Paris, I suppose,'' replied Mildred.  "I have 
left him, and I shall never go back.'' 
</p><p>"Presbury said you would!'' cried her mother. 
"But I didn't believe it.  I don't believe it.  I brought 
you up to do your duty, and I know you will.'' 
</p><p>This was Mildred's first opportunity for frank and 
plain speaking; and that is highly conducive to frank 
and plain thinking.  She now began to see clearly why 
she had quit the general.  Said she:  "Mamma, to be 
honest and not mince words, I've left him because there's 
nothing in it.'' 
</p><p>"Isn't he rich?'' inquired her mother.  "I've always 
had a kind of present&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"Oh, he's rich, all right,'' interrupted the girl. 
"But he saw to it that I got no benefit from that.'' 
</p><p>"But you wrote me how he was buying you everything!'' 
</p><p>"So I thought.  In fact he was buying <hi rend="italic">me</hi> 
nothing.'' 
And she went on to explain the general's system. 
</p><p>Her mother listened impatiently.  She would have in-
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0139" n="126"/>  
terrupted the long and angry recital many times had 
not Mildred insisted on a full hearing of her grievances, 
of the outrages that had been heaped upon her. 
"And,'' she ended, "I suppose he's got it so arranged 
that he could have me arrested as a thief for taking the 
gold bag.'' 
</p><p>"Yes, it's terrible and all that,'' said her mother. 
"But I should have thought living with me here when 
Presbury was carrying on so dreadfully would have 
taught you something.  Your case isn't an exception, 
any more than mine is.  That's the sort of thing we 
women have to put up with from men, when we're in 
their power.'' 
</p><p>"Not I,'' said Mildred loftily. 
</p><p>"Yes, you,'' retorted her mother.  "<hi rend="italic">any</hi> 
woman. 
<hi rend="italic">Every</hi> woman.  Unless we have money of our own, we 
all 
have trouble with the men about money, sooner or later, 
in one way or another.  And rich men!&mdash;why, it's 
notorious that they're always more or less mean about money. 
A wife has got to use tact.  Why, I even had to use 
some tact with your father, and he was as generous a 
man as ever lived.  Tact&mdash;that's a woman's whole life. 
You ought to have used tact.  You'll go back to him 
and use tact.'' 
</p><p>"You don't know him, mamma!'' cried Mildred. 
"He's a monster.  He isn't human.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Presbury drew a long face and said in a sad, 
soothing voice:  "Yes, I know, dear.  Men are very, 
very awful, in some ways, to a nice woman&mdash;with 
refined, ladylike instincts.  It's a great shock to a 
pure&mdash;'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0140" n="127"/> 
</p><p>"Oh, gammon!'' interrupted Mildred.  "Don't be 
silly, mother.  It isn't worth while for one woman to 
talk that kind of thing to another.  I didn't fully know 
what I was doing when I married a man I didn't love 
&mdash;a man who was almost repulsive to me.  But I knew 
enough.  And I was getting along well enough, as any 
woman does, no matter what she may say&mdash;yes, you 
needn't look shocked, for that's hypocrisy, and I know 
it now&mdash;  But, as I was saying, I didn't begin to <hi rend="italic">hate</hi> 
him until he tried to make a slave of me.  A slave!'' 
she shuddered.  "He's a monster!'' 
</p><p>"A little tact, and you can get everything you want,'' 
insisted her mother. 
</p><p>"I tell you, you don't know the man,'' cried Mildred. 
"By tact I suppose you mean I could have sold things 
behind his back&mdash;and all that.''  She laughed.  "He 
hasn't got any back.  He had it so arranged that those 
cold, wicked eyes of his were always watching me.  His 
second wife tried `tact.'  He caught her and drove her 
into the streets.  I'd have had no chance to get a cent, 
and if I had gotten it I'd not have dared spend it.  Do 
you imagine I ran away from him without having 
<hi rend="italic">thought</hi>?  If there'd been any way of staying on, 
any 
way of making things even endurable, I'd have 
stayed.'' 
</p><p>"But you've got to go back, Milly,'' cried her 
mother, in tears. 
</p><p>"You mean that you can't support me?'' 
</p><p>"And your brother Frank&mdash;'' Mrs. Presbury's 
eyes flashed and her rather stout cheeks quivered.  "I 
never thought I'd tell anybody, but I'll tell you.  I 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0141" n="128"/>  
never liked your brother Frank, and he never liked me. 
That sounds dreadful, doesn't it?'' 
</p><p>"No, mother dear,'' said Mildred gently.  "I've 
learned that life isn't at all as&mdash;as everybody pretends.'' 
</p><p>"Indeed it isn't,'' said her mother.  "Mothers always 
have favorites among their children, and very often a 
mother dislikes one of her children.  Of course she 
hides her feeling and does her duty.  But all the same 
she can't help the feeling that is down in her heart.  I 
had a presentiment before he was born that I wouldn't 
like him, and sure enough, I didn't.  And he didn't like 
me, or his father, or any of us.'' 
</p><p>"It would never occur to me to turn to him,'' said 
Mildred. 
</p><p>"Then you see that you've got to go back to the 
general.  You can't get a divorce and alimony, for it 
was you that left him&mdash;and for no cause.  He was 
within his rights.'' 
</p><p>Mildred hesitated, confessed:  "I had thought of 
going back to him and acting in such a way that he'd 
be glad to give me a divorce and an allowance.'' 
</p><p>"Yes, you might do that,'' said her mother.  "A 
great many women do.  And, after all, haven't they a 
right to?  A lady has got to have proper support, and 
is it just to ask her to live with a man she loathes?'' 
</p><p>"I haven't thought of the right or wrong of it,'' said 
Mildred.  "It looks to me as though right and wrong 
have very little to do with life as it's lived.  They're for 
hypocrites&mdash;and fools.'' 
</p><p>"Mildred!'' exclaimed her mother, deeply shocked. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0142" n="129"/>  
</p><p>Mildred was not a little shocked at her own thoughts 
as she inspected them in the full light into which speech 
had dragged them.  "Anyhow,'' she went on, "I soon 
saw that such a plan was hopeless.  He's not the man to 
be trifled with.  Long before I could drive him to give 
me a living and let me go he would have driven me to 
flight or suicide.'' 
</p><p>Her mother had now had time to reflect upon Mildred's 
revelations.  Aided by the impressions she herself had 
gotten of the little general, she began to understand why 
her daughter had fled and why she would not return. 
She felt that the situation was one which time alone 
could solve.  Said she:  "Well, the best thing is for 
you to stay on here and wait until he makes some 
move.'' 
</p><p>"He'll have me watched&mdash;that's all he'll do,'' said 
Mildred.  "When he gets ready he'll divorce me for 
deserting him.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Presbury felt that she was right.  But, 
concealing her despondency, she said:  "All we can do 
is to wait and see.  You must send for your luggage.'' 
</p><p>"I've nothing but a large bag,'' said Mildred.  "I 
checked it in the parcel-room of the New York station.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Presbury was overwhelmed.  How account to 
Hanging Rock for the reappearance of a baggageless 
and husbandless bride?  But she held up bravely. 
With a cheerfulness that did credit to her heart and 
showed how well she loved her daughter she said:  "We 
must do the best we can.  We'll get up some story.'' 
</p><p>"No,'' said Mildred.  "I'm going back to New 
York.  You can tell people here what you please&mdash; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0143" n="130"/>
that I've gone to rejoin him or to wait for him&mdash;any 
old thing.'' 
</p><p>"At least you'll wait and talk with Presbury,'' 
pleaded her mother.  "He is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> sensible.'' 
</p><p>"If he has anything to suggest,'' said Mildred, "he 
can write it.  I'll send you my address.'' 
</p><p>"Milly,'' cried her mother, agitated to the depths, 
"where <hi rend="italic">are</hi> you going?  <hi rend="italic">What</hi> are you going to do? 
You look so strange&mdash;not at all like yourself.'' 
</p><p>"I'm going to a hotel to-night&mdash;probably to a 
boarding-house to-morrow,'' said Mildred.  "In a few 
days I shall begin to&mdash;'' she hesitated, decided against 
confidence&mdash;'' begin to support myself at something or 
other.'' 
</p><p>"You must be crazy!'' cried her mother.  "You 
wouldn't do anything&mdash;and you couldn't.'' 
</p><p>"Let's not discuss it, mamma,'' said the girl tranquilly. 
</p><p>The mother looked at her with eyes full of the 
suspicion one lady cannot but have as to the projects of 
another lady in such circumstances. 
</p><p>"Mildred,'' she said pleadingly, "you must be 
careful.  You'll find yourself involved in a dreadful scandal. 
I know you wouldn't <hi rend="italic">do</hi> anything <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> no matter how 
you were driven.  But&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"I'll not do anything <hi rend="italic">foolish</hi>, mamma,'' 
interrupted 
the girl.  "You are thinking about men, aren't you?'' 
</p><p>"Men are always ready to destroy a woman,'' said 
her mother.  "You must be careful&mdash;'' 
</p><p>Mildred was laughing.  "Oh, mamma,'' she cried, "do 
be sensible and do give me credit for a little sense.  I've 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0144" n="131"/>  
got a very clear idea of what a woman ought to do 
about men, and I assure you I'm not going to be <hi rend="italic">foolish</hi>. 
And you know a woman who isn't foolish can be trusted 
where a woman who's only protected by her principles 
would yield to the first temptation&mdash;or hunt round for 
a temptation.'' 
</p><p>"But you simply can't go to New York and live 
there all alone&mdash;and with nothing!'' 
</p><p>"Can I stay here&mdash;for more than a few days?'' 
</p><p>"But maybe, after a few days&mdash;'' stammered her 
mother. 
</p><p>"You see, I've got to begin,'' said Mildred.  "So 
why delay?  I'd gain nothing.  I'd simply start Hanging 
Rock to gossiping&mdash;and start Mr. Presbury to 
acting like a fiend again.'' 
</p><p>Her mother refused to be convinced&mdash;was the firmer, 
perhaps, because she saw that Mildred was unshakable 
in her resolve to leave forthwith&mdash;the obviously sensible 
and less troublesome course.  They employed the rest 
of Mildred's three hours' stop in arguing&mdash;when Mildred 
was not raging against the little general.  Her 
mother was more than willing to assist her in this 
denunciation, but Mildred preferred to do it all herself. 
She had&mdash;perhaps by unconsciously absorbed training 
from her lawyer father&mdash;an unusual degree of ability 
to see both sides of a question.  When she assailed her 
husband, she saw only her own side; but somehow when 
her mother railed and raved, she began to see another 
side&mdash;and the sight was not agreeable.  She wished 
to feel that her husband was altogether in the wrong; 
she did not wish to have intruded upon her such facts 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0145" n="132"/>  
as that she had sold herself to him&mdash;quite in the 
customary way of ladies, but nevertheless quite shamelessly 
&mdash;or that in strict justice she had done nothing for him 
to entitle her to a liberal money allowance or any allowance 
at all. 
</p><p>On the train, going back to New York, she admitted 
to herself that the repulsive little general had held 
strictly to the terms of the bargain&mdash;'' but only a devil 
and one with not a single gentlemanly instinct would 
insist on such a bargain.''  It took away much of the 
shame, and all of the sting, of despising herself to feel 
that she was looking still lower when she turned to 
despising him. 
</p><p>To edge out the little general she began to think of 
her mother, but as she passed in review what her mother 
had said and how she had said it she saw that for all 
the protests and arguings her mother was more than 
resigned to her departure.  Mildred felt no bitterness; 
ever since she could remember her mother had been a 
shifter of responsibility.  Still, to stare into the face 
of so disagreeable a fact as that one had no place 
on earth to go to, no one on earth to turn to, not even 
one's own mother&mdash;to stare on at that grimacing ugliness 
did not tend to cheerfulness.  Mildred tried to 
think of the future&mdash;but how could she think of something 
that was nothing?  She knew that she would go 
on, somehow, in some direction, but by no effort of 
her imagination could she picture it.  She was so 
impressed by the necessity of considering the future that, 
to rouse herself, she tried to frighten herself with 
pictures of poverty and misery, of herself a derelict in the 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0146" n="133"/>
vast and cold desert of New York&mdash;perhaps in rags, 
hungry, ill, but all in vain.  She did not believe it. 
Always she had had plenty to wear and to eat, and 
comfortable surroundings.  She could no more think 
of herself as without those things than a living person 
can imagine himself dead. 
</p><p>"I'm a fool,'' she said to herself.  "I'm certain to 
get into all sorts of trouble.  How can it be otherwise, 
when I've no money, no friends, no experience, no way 
of making a living&mdash;no honest way&mdash;perhaps no way 
of the other kind, either?''  There are many women 
who ecstasize their easily tickled vanities by fancying 
that if they were so disposed they need only flutter an 
eyelid to have men by the legion striving for their favors, 
each man with a bag of gold.  Mildred, inexperienced 
as she was, had no such delusions.  Her mind happened 
not to be of that chastely licentious caste which continually 
revolves and fantastically exaggerates the things 
of the body. 
</p><p>She could not understand her own indifference about 
the future.  She did not realize that it was wholly due 
to Stanley Baird's offer.  She was imagining she was 
regarding that offer as something she might possibly 
consider, but probably would not.  She did not know 
that her soul had seized upon it, had enfolded it and 
would on no account let it go.  It is the habit of our 
secret selves thus to make decisions and await their own 
good time for making us acquainted with them. 
</p><p>With her bag on the seat beside her she set out to 
find a temporary lodging.  Not until several hotels had 
refused her admittance on the pretext that they were 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0147" n="134"/>  
"full up'' did she realize that a young woman alone is 
an object of suspicion in New York.  When a fourth 
room-clerk expressed his polite regrets she looked him 
straight in the eye and said: 
</p><p>"I understand.  But I can't sleep in the street.  You 
must tell me where I can go.'' 
</p><p>"Well, there's the Ripon over in Seventh Avenue,'' 
said he. 
</p><p>"Is it respectable?'' said she. 
</p><p>"Oh, it's very clean and comfortable there,'' said he. 
"They'll treat you right.'' 
</p><p>"Is it respectable?'' said she. 
</p><p>"Well, now, it doesn't <hi rend="italic">look</hi> queer, if 
that's what you 
mean,'' replied he.  "You'll do very nicely there.  You 
can be just as quiet as you want.'' 
</p><p>She saw that hotel New York would not believe her 
respectable.  So to the Ripon she went, and was admitted 
without discussion.  As the last respectable clerk 
had said, it did not <hi rend="italic">look</hi> queer.  But it <hi rend="italic">felt</hi> queer; she 
resolved that she would go into a boarding-house the 
very next day. 
</p><p>Here again what seemed simple proved difficult.  No 
respectable boarding-house would have Miss Mary 
Stevens.  She was confident that nothing in her dress 
or manner hinted mystery.  Yet those sharp-eyed land-ladies seemed to know at once that there was something 
peculiar about her.  Most of them became rude the 
instant they set eyes upon her.  A few&mdash;of the obviously 
less prosperous class&mdash;talked with her, seemed to be 
listening for something which her failing to say decided 
them upon all but ordering her out of the house.  She, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0148" n="135"/>
hindered by her innocence, was slow in realizing that 
she could not hope for admission to any select respectable 
circle, even of high-class salesladies and clerks, 
unless she gave a free and clear account of herself&mdash; 
whence she had come, what she was doing, how she got 
her money. 
</p><p>Toward the end of the second day's wearisome and 
humiliating search she found a house that would admit 
her.  It was a pretentious, well-furnished big house in 
Madison Avenue.  The price&mdash;thirty-five dollars a 
week for board, a bedroom with a folding bed in an 
alcove, and a bath, was more than double what she had 
counted on paying, but she discovered that decent and 
clean lodgings and food fit to eat were not to be had 
for less.  "And I simply can't live pig-fashion,'' said 
she.  "I'd be so depressed that I could do nothing.  I 
can't live like a wild animal, and I won't.''  She had 
some vague notion&mdash;foreboding&mdash;that this was not 
the proper spirit with which to face life.  "I suppose 
I'm horribly foolish,'' reflected she, "but if I must go 
down, I'll go down with my colors flying.''  She did 
not know precisely what that phrase meant, but it 
sounded fine and brave and heartened her to take the 
expensive lodgings. 
</p><p>The landlady was a Mrs. Belloc.  Mildred had not 
talked with her twenty minutes before she had a feeling 
that this name was assumed.  The evening of her first 
day in the house she learned that her guess was correct 
&mdash;learned it from the landlady herself.  After dinner 
Mrs. Belloc came into her room to cheer her up, to find 
out about her and to tell her about herself. 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0149" n="136"/> 
</p><p>"Now that you've come,'' said she, "the house is 
full up&mdash;except some little rooms at the top that I'd 
as lief not fill.  The probabilities are that any ladies 
who would take them wouldn't be refined enough to suit 
those I have.  There are six, not counting me, every 
one with a bath and two with private parlors.  And as 
they're all handsome, sensible women, ladylike and 
steady, I think the prospects are that they'll pay 
promptly and that I won't have any trouble.'' 
</p><p>Mildred reflected upon this curious statement.  It 
sounded innocent enough, yet what a peculiar way to 
put a simple fact. 
</p><p>"Of course it's none of my business how people live 
as long as they keep up the respectabilities,'' pursued 
Mrs. Belloc.  "It don't do to inquire into people in 
New York.  Most of 'em come here because they want 
to live as they please.'' 
</p><p>"No doubt,'' said Mildred a little nervously, for she 
suspected her landlady of hitting at her, and wondered 
if she had come to cross-examine her and, if the results 
were not satisfactory, to put her into the street. 
</p><p>"I know <hi rend="italic">I</hi> came for that reason,'' pursued 
Mrs. 
Belloc.  "I was a school-teacher up in New England 
until about two years ago.  Did you ever teach 
school?'' 
</p><p>"Not yet,'' said Mildred.  "And I don't think I ever 
shall.  I don't know enough.'' 
</p><p>"Oh, yes, you do.  A teacher doesn't need to know 
much.  The wages are so poor&mdash;at least up in New 
England&mdash;that they don't expect you to know anything. 
It's all in the books.  I left because I couldn't 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0150" n="137"/>
endure the life.  Lord! how dull those little towns are! 
Ever live in a little town?'' 
</p><p>"All my life,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"Well, you'll never go back.'' 
</p><p>"I hope not.'' 
</p><p>"You won't.  Why should you?  A sensible woman 
with looks&mdash;especially if she knows how to carry her 
clothes&mdash;can stay in New York as long as she pleases, 
and live off the fat of the land.'' 
</p><p>"That's good news,'' said Mildred.  She began to 
like the landlady&mdash;not for what she said, but for the 
free and frank and friendly way of the saying&mdash;a 
human way, a comradely way, a live-and-let-live way. 
</p><p>"I didn't escape from New England without a 
struggle,'' continued Mrs. Belloc, who was plainly showing 
that she had taken a great fancy to "Mary Stevens.'' 
</p><p>"I suppose it was hard to save the money out of 
your salary,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>Mrs. Belloc laughed.  She was about thirty-five years 
old, though her eyes and her figure were younger than 
that.  Her mouth was pleasant enough, but had lost 
some of its freshness.  "Save money!'' cried she. 
"I'd never have succeeded that way.  I'd be there yet. 
I had never married&mdash;had two or three chances, but 
all from poor sticks looking for someone to support 
them.  I saw myself getting old.  I was looking years 
older than I do now.  Talk about sea air for freshening a 
woman up&mdash;it isn't in it with the air of New York. 
Here's the town where women stay young.  If I had 
come here five years ago I could almost try for the squab 
class.'' 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0151" n="138"/>
</p><p>"Squab class?'' queried Mildred. 
</p><p>"Yes, squabs.  Don't you see them around everywhere?&mdash; 
the women dressed like girls of sixteen to 
eighteen&mdash;and some of them are that, and younger. 
They go hopping and laughing about&mdash;and they seem 
to please the men and to have no end of a good time. 
Especially the oldish men.  Oh, yes, you know a squab 
on sight&mdash;tight skirt, low shoes and silk stockings, 
cute pretty face, always laughing, hat set on rakishly 
and hair done to match, and always a big purse or 
bag&mdash;with a yellow-back or so in it&mdash;as a kind of a 
hint, I guess.'' 
</p><p>Mildred had seen squabs.  "I've envied them&mdash;in a 
way,'' said she.  "Their parents seem to let them do 
about as they please.'' 
</p><p>"Their parents don't know&mdash;or don't care.  Sometimes 
it's one, sometimes the other.  They travel in two 
sets.  One is where they meet young fellows of their 
own class&mdash;the kind they'll probably marry, unless 
they happen to draw the capital prize.  The other set 
they travel in&mdash;well, it's the older men they meet round 
the swell hotels and so on&mdash;the yellow-back men.'' 
</p><p>"How queer!'' exclaimed Mildred, before whose eyes 
a new world was opening.  "But how do they&mdash;these 
&mdash;squabs&mdash;account for the money?'' 
</p><p>"How do a thousand and one women in this funny 
town account at home for money and things?'' retorted 
Mrs. Belloc.  "Nothing's easier.  For instance, often 
these squabs do&mdash;or pretend to do&mdash;a little something 
in the way of work&mdash;a little canvassing or artists' 
model or anything you please.  That helps them to 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0152" n="139"/> 
explain at home&mdash;and also to make each of the yellow-back men think he's the only one and that he's being 
almost loved for himself alone.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Belloc laughed.  Mildred was too astonished 
to laugh, and too interested&mdash;and too startled or 
shocked. 
</p><p>"But I was telling you how <hi rend="italic">I</hi> got down 
here,'' 
continued the landlady.  "Up in my town there was an 
old man&mdash;about seventy-five&mdash;close as the bark on 
a tree, and ugly and mean.''  She paused to draw a 
long breath and to shake her head angrily yet 
triumphantly at some figure her fancy conjured up. 
"Oh, he <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a pup!&mdash;and is!  Well, anyhow, I 
decided that I'd marry him.  So I wrote home for fifty 
dollars.  I borrowed another fifty here and there.  I 
had seventy-five saved up against sickness.  I went up 
to Boston and laid it all out in underclothes and house 
things&mdash;not showy but fine and good to look at.  Then 
one day, when the weather was fine and I knew the old 
man would be out in his buggy driving round&mdash;I 
dressed myself up to beat the band.  I took hours to 
it&mdash;scrubbing, powdering, sacheting, perfuming, 
fixing the hair, fixing my finger-nails, fixing up my feet, 
polishing every nail and making them look better than 
most hands.'' 
</p><p>Mildred was so interested that she was excited.  What 
strange freak was coming? 
</p><p>"You never could guess,'' pursued Mrs. Belloc, 
complacently.  "I took my sunshade and went out, all got 
up to kill.  And I walked along the road until I saw 
the old man's buggy coming with him in it.  Then I 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0153" n="140"/> 
gave my ankle a frightful wrench.  My!  How it 
hurt!'' 
</p><p>"What a pity!'' said Mildred sympathetically. 
"What a shame!'' 
</p><p>"A pity?  A shame?'' cried Mrs. Belloc, laughing. 
"Why, my dear, I did it a-purpose.'' 
</p><p>"On purpose!'' exclaimed Mildred. 
</p><p>"Certainly.  That was my game.  I screamed out 
with pain&mdash;and the scream was no fake, I can tell 
you.  And I fell down by the roadside on a nice grassy 
spot where no dust would get on me.  Well, up comes 
the old skinflint in his buggy.  He climbed down and 
helped me get off my slipper and stocking.  I knew 
I had him the minute I saw his old face looking at that 
foot I had fixed up so beautifully.'' 
</p><p>"How <hi rend="italic">did</hi> you ever think of it?'' exclaimed 
Mildred. 
</p><p>"Go and teach school for ten years in a dull little 
town, my dear&mdash;and look in the glass every day and 
see your youth fading away&mdash;and you'll think of most 
anything.  Well, to make a long story short, the old 
man took me in the buggy to his house where he lived 
with his deaf, half-blind old widowed daughter.  I had 
to stay there three weeks.  I married him the fourth 
week.  And just two months to a day from the afternoon 
I sprained my ankle, he gave me fifty dollars a 
week&mdash;all signed and sealed by a lawyer&mdash;to go away 
and leave him alone.  I might have stood out for more, 
but I was too anxious to get to New York.  And here 
I am!''  She gazed about the well-furnished room, 
typical of that almost luxurious house, with an air of 
triumphant satisfaction.  Said she:  "I've no patience 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0154" n="141"/>  
with a woman who says she can't get on.  Where's her 
brains?'' 
</p><p>Mildred was silent.  Perhaps it was a feeling of what 
was hazily in the younger woman's mind and a desire 
to answer it that led Mrs. Belloc to say further:  "I 
suppose there's some that would criticize my way of 
getting there.  But I want to know, don't all women 
get there by working men?  Only most of them are so 
stupid that they have to go on living with the man. 
I think it's low to live with a man you hate.'' 
</p><p>"Oh, I'm not criticizing anybody,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"I didn't think you were,'' said Mrs. Belloc.  "If 
I hadn't seen you weren't that kind, I'd not have been 
so confidential.  Not that I'm secretive with anybody. 
I say and do what I please.  Anyone who doesn't like 
my way or me can take the other side of the street. 
I didn't come to New York to go in society.  I came 
here to <hi rend="italic">live</hi>.'' 
</p><p>Mildred looked at her admiringly.  There were 
things about Mrs. Belloc that she did not admire; other 
things&mdash;suspected rather than known things&mdash;that 
she knew she would shrink from, but she heartily 
admired and profoundly envied her utter indifference to 
the opinion of others, her fine independent way of 
walking her own path at her own gait. 
</p><p>"I took this boarding-house,'' Mrs. Belloc went on, 
"because I didn't want to be lonesome.  I don't like 
all&mdash;or even most of&mdash;the ladies that live here.  But 
they're all amusing to talk with&mdash;and don't put on 
airs except with their men friends.  And one or two 
are the real thing&mdash;good-hearted, fond of a joke, with-
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0155" n="142"/>  
out any meanness.  I tell you, New York is a mighty 
fine place if you get `in right.'  Of course, if you 
don't, it's h-e-l-l.''  (Mrs. Belloc took off its unrefined 
edge by spelling it.)  "But what place isn't?'' she 
added. 
</p><p>"And your husband never bothers you?'' inquired 
Mildred. 
</p><p>"And never will,'' replied Mrs. Belloc.  "When he 
dies I'll come into a little more&mdash;about a hundred and 
fifty a week in all.  Not a fortune, but enough with 
what the boarding-house brings in.  I'm a pretty fair 
business woman.'' 
</p><p>"I should say so!'' exclaimed Mildred. 
</p><p>"You said you were Miss Stevens, didn't you?'' said 
Mrs. Belloc&mdash;and Mildred knew that her turn had 
come. 
</p><p>"Yes,'' replied she.  "But I am also a married 
woman.''  She hesitated, reddened.  "I didn't give you 
my married name.'' 
</p><p>"That's your own business,'' said Mrs. Belloc in her 
easiest manner.  "My right name isn't Belloc, either. 
But I've dropped that other life.  You needn't feel a 
bit embarrassed in this house.  Some of my boarders 
<hi rend="italic">seem</hi> to be married.  All that have 
regular-appearing 
husbands <hi rend="italic">say</hi> they are.  What do I care, so long as 
everything goes along smoothly?  I don't get excited 
about trifles.'' 
</p><p>"Some day perhaps I'll tell you about myself,'' said 
Mildred.  "Just at present I&mdash;well, I seem not to 
be able to talk about things.'' 
</p><p>"It's not a bad idea to keep your mouth shut, as 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0156" n="143"/> 
long as your affairs are unsettled,'' advised Mrs. Belloc. 
"I can see you've had little experience.  But you'll 
come out all right.  Just keep cool, and don't fret 
about trifles.  And don't let any man make a fool of 
you.  That's where we women get left.  We're afraid 
of men.  We needn't be.  We can mighty easily make 
them afraid of us.  Use the soft hand till you get him 
well in your grip.  Then the firm hand.  Nothing 
coarse or cruel or mean.  But firm and self-respecting.'' 
</p><p>Mildred was tempted to take Mrs. Belloc fully into 
her confidence and get the benefit of the advice of 
shrewdness and experience.  So strong was the 
temptation, she would have yielded to it had Mrs. Belloc 
asked a few tactful, penetrating questions.  But Mrs. 
Belloc refrained, and Mildred's timidity or delicacy 
induced her to postpone.  The next day she wrote Stanley 
Baird, giving her address and her name and asking him 
to call "any afternoon at four or five.''  She assumed 
that he would come on the following day, but the letter 
happened to reach him within an hour of her mailing 
it, and he came that very afternoon. 
</p><p>When she went down to the drawing-room to receive 
him, she found him standing in the middle of the room 
gazing about with a quizzical expression.  As soon as 
the greetings were over he said: 
</p><p>"You must get out of here, Mildred.  This won't 
do.'' 
</p><p>"Indeed I shan't,'' said she.  "I've looked everywhere, 
and this is the only comfortable place I could 
find&mdash;where the rates were reasonable and where the 
landlady didn't have her nose in everybody's business.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0157" n="144"/>
</p><p>"You don't understand,'' said he.  "This is a bird-cage.  Highly gilded, but a bird-cage.'' 
</p><p>She had never heard the phrase, but she understood&mdash; 
and instantly she knew that he was right.  She colored 
violently, sat down abruptly.  But in a moment she 
recovered herself, and with fine defiance said: 
</p><p>"I don't care.  Mrs. Belloc is a kind-hearted woman, 
and it's as easy to be respectable here as anywhere.'' 
</p><p>"Sure,'' assented he.  "But you've got to consider 
appearances to a certain extent.  You won't be able to 
find the right sort of a boarding-house&mdash;one you'd be 
comfortable in.  You've got to have a flat of your 
own.'' 
</p><p>"I can't afford it,'' said Mildred.  "I can't afford 
this, even.  But I simply will not live in a shabby, 
mussy way.'' 
</p><p>"That's right!'' cried Stanley.  "You can't do 
proper work in poor surroundings.  Some women 
could, but not your sort.  But don't worry.  I'm going 
to see you through.  I'll find a place&mdash;right away. 
You want to start in at once, don't you?'' 
</p><p>"I've got to,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"Then leave it all to me.'' 
</p><p>"But <hi rend="italic">what</hi> am I to do?'' 
</p><p>"Sing, if you can.  If not, then act.  We'll have 
you on the stage within a year or so.  I'm sure of it. 
And I'll get my money back, with interest.'' 
</p><p>"I don't see how I can accept it,'' said Mildred very 
feebly. 
</p><p>"You've got to,'' said Stanley.  "What alternative 
is there?  None.  So let's bother no more about it. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0158" n="145"/>  
I'll consult with those who know, find out what the thing 
costs, and arrange everything.  You're as helpless as a 
baby, and you know it.'' 
</p><p>Yes, Mildred knew it. 
</p><p>He looked at her with an amused smile.  "Come, 
out with it!'' he cried.  "You've got something on 
your mind.  Let's get everything straight&mdash;and keep 
it that way.'' 
</p><p>Mildred hung her head. 
</p><p>"You're uneasy because I, a man, am doing this for 
you, a young woman?  Is that it?'' 
</p><p>"Yes,'' she confessed. 
</p><p>He leaned back in his chair, crossed his legs, and 
spoke in a brisk, businesslike way.  "In the first place, 
it's got to be done, hasn't it?  And someone has got 
to do it?  And there is no one offering but me?  Am 
I right?'' 
</p><p>She nodded. 
</p><p>"Then <hi rend="italic">I</hi>'ve got to do it, and you've <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to let me. 
There's logic, if ever there was logic.  A Philadelphia 
lawyer couldn't knock a hole in it.  You trust me, don't 
you?'' 
</p><p>She was silent. 
</p><p>"You don't trust me, then,'' said he cheerfully. 
"Well, perhaps you're right.  But you trust yourself, 
don't you?'' 
</p><p>She moved restlessly, but remained silent. 
</p><p>"You are afraid I might put you in a difficult position?'' 
</p><p>"Something like that,'' she admitted, in a low, 
embarrassed voice. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0159" n="146"/>
</p><p>"You fear that I expect some return which you do 
not intend to give?'' 
</p><p>She was silent. 
</p><p>"Well, I don't,'' said he bluntly.  "So put your 
mind at rest.  Some day I'll tell you why I am doing 
this, but I want you to feel that I ask nothing of you 
but my money back with interest, when you can afford 
to pay.'' 
</p><p>"I can't feel that,'' said she.  "You're putting me 
in your debt&mdash;so heavily that I'd feel I ought to pay 
anything you asked.  But I couldn't and wouldn't 
pay.'' 
</p><p>"Unless you felt like it?'' suggested he. 
</p><p>"It's honest for me to warn you that I'm not likely 
to feel that way.'' 
</p><p>"There is such a thing as winning a woman's love, 
isn't there?'' said he jestingly.  It was difficult to tell 
when Stanley Baird was jesting and when he was in 
earnest. 
</p><p>"Is that what you expect?'' said she gravely. 
</p><p>"If I say yes?'' 
</p><p>She lowered her eyes and laughed in an embarrassed 
way. 
</p><p>He was frankly amused.  "You see, you feel that 
you're in my power.  And you are.  So why not make 
the best of it?''  A pause, then he said abruptly and 
with a convincing manliness, "I think, Mildred, you 
can trust me not to be a beast.'' 
</p><p>She colored and looked at him with quick contrition. 
"I'm ashamed of myself,'' said she.  "Please forget 
that I said anything.  I'll take what I must, and I'll 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0160" n="147"/>
pay it back as soon as I can.  And&mdash;thank you, Stanley.'' 
The tears were in her eyes.  "If I had anything 
worth your taking I'd be glad to give it to you.  What 
vain fools we women are!'' 
</p><p>"Aren't you, though!'' laughed he.  "And now it's 
all settled&mdash;until you're on the stage, and free, and 
the money's paid back&mdash;<hi rend="italic">with</hi> interest.  I shall 
charge 
you six per cent.'' 
</p><p>When she first knew him she had not been in the least 
impressed by what now seemed to her his finest and 
rarest trait, for, in those days she had been as ignorant 
of the realities of human nature as one who has never 
adventured his boat beyond the mouth of the peaceful 
land-locked harbor is ignorant of the open sea.  But 
in the hard years she had been learning&mdash;not only 
from Presbury and General Siddall, but from the cook 
and the housemaid, from every creditor, every tradesman, 
everyone whose attitude socially toward her had 
been modified by her changed fortunes&mdash;and whose 
attitude had not been changed?  Thus, she was now 
able to appreciate&mdash;at least in some measure&mdash;Stanley 
Baird's delicacy and tact.  No, not delicacy and 
tact, for that implied effort.  His ability to put this 
offer in such a way that she could accept without serious 
embarrassment arose from a genuine indifference to 
money as money, a habit of looking upon it simply 
as a means to an end.  He offered her the money 
precisely as he would have offered her his superior strength 
if it had been necessary to cross a too deep and swift 
creek.  She had the sense that he felt he was doing 
something even less notable than he admitted, and that 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0161" n="148"/> 
he talked of it as a valuable and rather unusual service 
simply because it was the habit thus to regard such 
matters. 
</p><p>As they talked on of "the great career'' her spirits 
went up and up.  It was evident that he now had a 
new and keen interest in life, that she was doing him 
a greater favor than he was doing her.  He had always 
had money, plenty of it, more than he could use.  He 
now had more than ever&mdash;for, several rich relatives 
had died and, after the habit of the rich, had left 
everything to him, the one of all the connections who needed 
it least.  He had a very human aversion to spending 
money upon people or things he did not like.  He 
would have fought to the last court an attempt by his 
wife to get alimony.  He had a reputation with the 
"charity gang'' of being stingy because he would not 
give them so much as the price of a bazaar ticket. 
Also, the impecunious spongers at his clubs spread his 
fame as a "tight-wad'' because he refused to let them 
"stick him up'' for even a round of drinks.  Where 
many a really stingy man yielded through weakness 
or fear of public opinion, he stood firm.  His one 
notable surrender of any kind had been his marriage; 
that bitter experience had cured him of the surrendering 
habit for all time.  Thenceforth he did absolutely 
and in everything as he pleased. 
</p><p>Mildred had heard that he was close about money. 
She had all but forgotten it, because her own experience 
with him had made such a charge seem ridiculous. 
She now assumed&mdash;so far as she thought about it at 
all&mdash;that he was extremely generous.  She did not 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0162" n="149"/> 
realize what a fine discriminating generosity his was, 
or how striking an evidence of his belief in her as well 
as of his liking for her. 
</p><p>As he rose to go he said:  "You mustn't forget that 
our arrangement is a secret between us.  Neither of 
us can afford to have anyone know it.'' 
</p><p>"There isn't anyone in the world who wouldn't 
misunderstand it,'' said she, without the least feeling of 
embarrassment. 
</p><p>"Just so,'' said he.  "And I want you to live in 
such a way that I can come to call.  We must arrange 
things so that you will take your own name&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"I intend to use the name Mary Stevens in my 
work,'' she interrupted. 
</p><p>"But there mustn't be any concealment, any mystery 
to excite curiosity and scandal&mdash;'' 
</p><p>This time the interruption was her expression.  He 
turned to see what had startled her, and saw in the 
doorway of the drawing-room the grotesquely neat and 
stylish figure of the little general.  Before either could 
speak he said: 
</p><p>"How d'you do, Mr. Baird?  You'll pardon me if 
I ask you to leave me alone with my <hi rend="italic">wife</hi>.'' 
</p><p>Stanley met the situation with perfect coolness. 
"How are you, General?'' said he.  "Certainly, I 
was just going.''  He extended his hand to Mildred, 
said in a correct tone of conventional friendliness, 
"Then you'll let me know when you're settled?''  He 
bowed, moved toward the door, shook hands with the 
general, and passed out, giving from start to finish a 
model example of a man of the world extricating him-
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0163" n="150"/>
self from an impossible situation and leaving it the 
better for his having been entangled.  To a man of 
Siddall's incessant and clumsy self-consciousness such 
unaffected ease could not but be proof positive of 
Mildred's innocence&mdash;unless he had overheard.  And his 
first words convinced her that he had not.  Said he: 
</p><p>"So you sent for your old admirer?'' 
</p><p>"I ran across him accidentally,'' replied Mildred. 
</p><p>"I know,'' said the little general.  "My men picked 
you up at the pier and haven't lost sight of you since. 
It's fortunate that I've kept myself informed, or I 
might have misunderstood that chap's being here.''  A 
queer, cloudy look came into his eyes.  "I must give 
him a warning for safety's sake.''  He waved his hand 
in dismissal of such an unimportant trifle as the accidental 
Baird.  He went on, his wicked eyes bent coldly 
and dully upon her:  "Do you know what kind of a 
house this is?'' 
</p><p>"Stanley Baird urged me to leave,'' replied she. 
"But I shall stay until I find a better&mdash;and that's not 
easy.'' 
</p><p>"Yes, my men have reported to me on the difficulties 
you've had.  It was certainly fortunate for you 
that I had them look after you.  Otherwise I'd never 
have understood your landing in this sort of a house. 
You are ready to come with me?'' 
</p><p>"Your secretary explained that if I left the hotel 
it was the end.'' 
</p><p>"He told you that by my orders.'' 
</p><p>"So he explained,'' said Mildred.  She seated herself, 
overcome by a sudden lassitude that was accompanied 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0164" n="151"/>
not by fear, but by indifference.  "Won't you sit down? 
I am willing to hear what you have to say.'' 
</p><p>The little general, about to sit, was so astonished 
that he straightened and stiffened himself.  "In 
consenting to overlook your conduct and take you back 
I have gone farther than I ever intended.  I have taken 
into consideration your youth and inexperience.'' 
</p><p>"But I am not going back,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>The little general slowly seated himself.  "You have 
less than two hundred and fifty dollars left,'' said he. 
</p><p>"Really?  Your spies know better than I.'' 
</p><p>"I have seen Presbury.  He assures me that in no 
circumstances will he and your mother take you back.'' 
</p><p>"They will not have the chance to refuse,'' said 
Mildred. 
</p><p>"As for your brother&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"I have no brother,'' said she coldly. 
</p><p>"Then you are coming back with me.'' 
</p><p>"No,'' said Mildred.  "I should''&mdash;she cast about 
for an impressive alternative&mdash;"I should stay on here, 
rather.'' 
</p><p>The little general&mdash;his neat varnished leather and 
be-spatted shoes just touched the floor&mdash;examined his 
highly polished top-hat at several angles.  Finally he 
said:  "You need not fear that your misconduct will 
be remembered against you.  I shall treat you in every 
way as my wife.  I shall assume that your&mdash;your 
flight was an impulse that you regret.'' 
</p><p>"I shan't go back,'' said Mildred.  "Nothing you 
could offer would change me.'' 
</p><p>"I cannot make any immediate concession on the&mdash; 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0165" n="152"/>  
the matter that caused you to go,'' pursued he, as if 
she had not spoken, "but if I see that you have reliability 
and good sense, I'll agree to give you an allowance later.'' 
</p><p>Mildred eyed him curiously.  "Why are you making 
these offers, these concessions?'' she said.  "You think 
everyone in the world is a fool except yourself.  You're 
greatly deceived.  I know that you don't mean what 
you've been saying.  I know that if you got me in 
your power again, you would do something frightful. 
I've seen through that mask you wear.  I know the 
kind of man you are.'' 
</p><p>"If you know that,'' said the general in his even 
slow way, monotonous, almost lifeless, "you know you'd 
better come with me than stand out against me.'' 
</p><p>She did not let him see how this struck terror into 
her.  She said:  "No matter what you might do to me, 
when I'm away from you, it would be less than you'd 
do with me under your roof.  At any rate, it'd seem 
less.'' 
</p><p>The general reflected, decided to change to another 
point:  "You made a bargain with me.  You've broken 
it.  I never let anyone break a bargain with me without 
making them regret it.  I'm giving you a chance 
to keep your bargain.'' 
</p><p>She was tempted to discuss, but she could not find 
the words, or the strength.  Besides, how futile to 
discuss with such a man.  She sank back in her chair 
wearily.  "I shall never go back,'' she said. 
</p><p>He looked at her, his face devoid of expression, but 
she had a sense of malignance unutterable eying her 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0166" n="153"/>
from behind a screen.  He said:  "I see you've 
misunderstood my generosity.  You think I'm weak where 
you are concerned because I've come to you instead of 
doing as I said and making you come to me.''  He rose. 
"Well, my offer to you is closed.  And once more I 
say, you will come to me and ask to be taken back.  I 
may or may not take you back.  It depends on how 
I'll feel at that time.'' 
</p><p>Slowly, with his ludicrously pompous strut, he 
marched to the drawing-room door.  She had not felt 
like smiling, but if there had been any such inclination 
it would have fled before the countenance that turned 
upon her at the threshold.  It was the lean, little face 
with the funny toupee and needle-like mustache and 
imperial, but behind it lay a personality like the dull, 
cold, yellow eyes of the devil-fish ambushed in the hazy 
mass of dun-colored formlessness of collapsed body 
and tentacles.  He said: 
</p><p>"You'd best be careful how you conduct yourself. 
You'll be under constant observation.  And any friends 
you make&mdash;they'd do well to avoid you.'' 
</p><p>He was gone.  She sat without the power of motion, 
without the power of thought.  After a time&mdash;perhaps 
long, perhaps short, she did not know&mdash;Mrs. 
Belloc came in and entered upon a voluble apology for 
the maid's having shown "the little gentleman'' into 
the drawing-room when another was already there. 
"That maid's as green as spring corn,'' said she. 
"Such a thing never happened in my house before. 
And it'll never happen again.  I do hope it didn't cause 
trouble.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0167" n="154"/>  
</p><p>"It was my husband,'' said Mildred.  "I had to see 
him some time.'' 
</p><p>"He's certainly a very elegant little gentleman,'' 
said Mrs. Belloc.  "I rather like small men, myself.'' 
</p><p>Mildred gazed at her vaguely and said, "Tell me&mdash; 
a rich man, a very rich man&mdash;if he hates anyone, can 
he make trouble?'' 
</p><p>"Money can do anything in this town,'' replied Mrs. 
Belloc.  "But usually rich men are timid and stingy. 
If they weren't, they'd make us all cringe.  As it is, 
I've heard some awful stories of how men and women 
who've got some powerful person down on them have 
been hounded.'' 
</p><p>Mildred turned deathly sick.  "I think I'll go to 
my room,'' she said, rising uncertainly and forcing 
herself toward the door. 
</p><p>Mrs. Belloc's curiosity could not restrain itself. 
"You're leaving?'' she asked.  "You're going back 
to your husband?'' 
</p><p>She was startled when the girl abruptly turned on 
her and cried with flashing eyes and voice strong and 
vibrant with passion:  "Never!  Never!  No matter 
what comes&mdash;<hi rend="italic">never!</hi>'' 
</p><p>The rest of the day and that night she hid in her 
room and made no effort to resist the terror that preyed 
upon her.  Just as our strength is often the source of 
weakness, so our weaknesses often give birth to strength. 
Her terror of the little general, given full swing, 
shrieked and grimaced itself into absurdity.  She was 
ashamed of her orgy, was laughing at it as the sun 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0168" n="155"/> 
and intoxicating air of a typical New York morning 
poured in upon her.  She accepted Mrs. Belloc's 
invitation to take a turn through the park and up 
Riverside Drive in a taxicab, came back restored to her 
normal state of blind confidence in the future.  About 
noon Stanley Baird telephoned. 
</p><p>"We must not see each other again for some time,'' 
said he.  "I rather suspect that you&mdash;know&mdash;who may be 
having you watched.'' 
</p><p>"I'm sure of it,'' said she.  "He warned me.'' 
</p><p>"Don't let that disturb you,'' pursued Stanley.  "A 
man&mdash;a singing teacher&mdash;his name's Eugene Jennings&mdash; 
will call on you this afternoon at three.  Do 
exactly as he suggests.  Let him do all the talking.'' 
</p><p>She had intended to tell Baird frankly that she 
thought, indeed knew, that it was highly dangerous for 
him to enter into her affairs in any way, and to urge 
him to draw off.  She felt that it was only fair to act 
so toward one who had been unselfishly generous to 
her.  But now that the time for speaking had come, 
she found herself unable to speak.  Only by flatly 
refusing to have anything to do with his project could 
she prevail upon him.  To say less than that she had 
completely and finally changed her mind would sound, 
and would be, insincere.  And that she could not say. 
She felt how noble it would be to say this, how selfish, 
and weak, too, it was to cling to him, possibly to 
involve him in disagreeable and even dangerous complications, 
but she had no strength to do what she would have 
denounced another as base for not doing.  Instead of 
the lofty words that flow so freely from the lips of stage 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0169" n="156"/> 
and fiction heroines, instead of the words that any and 
every reader of this history would doubtless have 
pronounced in the same circumstances, she said: 
</p><p>"You're quite sure you want to go on?'' 
</p><p>"Why not?'' came instantly back over the wire. 
</p><p>"He is a very, very relentless man,'' replied she. 
</p><p>"Did he try to frighten you?'' 
</p><p>"I'm afraid he succeeded.'' 
</p><p>"You're not going back on the career!'' exclaimed 
he excitedly.  "I'll come down there and&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"No, no,'' cried she.  "I was simply giving you a 
chance to free yourself.''  She felt sure of him now. 
She scrambled toward the heights of moral grandeur. 
"I want you to stop.  I've no right to ask you to 
involve yourself in my misfortunes.  Stanley, you 
mustn't.  I can't allow it.'' 
</p><p>"Oh, fudge!'' laughed he.  "Don't give me these 
scares.  Don't forget&mdash;Jennings at three.  Good-by 
and good luck.'' 
</p><p>And he rang off that she might have no chance on 
impulse to do herself mischief with her generous 
thoughtfulness for him.  She felt rather mean, but not 
nearly so mean as she would have felt had she let the 
opportunity go by with no generous word said.  "And 
no doubt my aversion for that little wretch,'' thought 
she, "makes me think him more terrible than he is. 
After all, what can he do?  Watch me&mdash;and discover 
nothing, because there'll be nothing to discover.'' 
</p><p>Jennings came exactly at three&mdash;came with the air 
of a man who wastes no one's time and lets no one waste 
his time.  He was a youngish man of forty or there-
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0170" n="157"/> 
abouts, with a long sharp nose, a large tight mouth, 
and eyes that seemed to be looking restlessly about for 
money.  That they had not looked in vain seemed to be 
indicated by such facts as that he came in a private 
brougham and that he was most carefully dressed, 
apparently with the aid of a valet. 
</p><p>"Miss Stevens,'' he said with an abrupt bow, before 
Mildred had a chance to speak, "you have come to New 
York to take singing lessons&mdash;to prepare yourself for 
the stage.  And you wish a comfortable place to live 
and to work.''  He extended his gloved hand, shook 
hers frigidly, dropped it.  "We shall get on&mdash;<hi rend="italic">if</hi> 
you 
work, but only if you work.  I do not waste myself upon 
triflers.''  He drew a card from his pocket.  "If you 
will go to see the lady whose name and address are 
written on this card, I think you will find the quarters 
you are looking for.'' 
</p><p>"Thank you,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"Come to me&mdash;my address is on the card, also&mdash; 
at half-past ten on Saturday.  We will then lay out 
your work.'' 
</p><p>"If you find I have a voice worth while,'' Mildred 
ventured. 
</p><p>"That, of course,'' said Mr. Jennings curtly. 
"Until half-past ten on Saturday, good day.'' 
</p><p>Again he gave the abrupt foreign bow and, while 
Mildred was still struggling with her surprise and 
confusion, she saw him, through the window, driving 
rapidly away.  Mrs. Belloc came drifting through the 
room; she had the habit of looking about whenever 
there were new visitors, and in her it was not irritating 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0171" n="158"/> 
because her interest was innocent and sympathetic. 
Said Mildred: 
</p><p>"Did you see that man, Mrs. Belloc?'' 
</p><p>"What an extraordinary nose he had,'' replied she. 
</p><p>"Yes, I noticed that,'' said Mildred.  "But it was 
the only thing I did notice.  He is a singing teacher&mdash; 
Mr. Jennings.'' 
</p><p>"Eugene Jennings?'' 
</p><p>"Yes, Eugene.'' 
</p><p>"He's the best known singing teacher in New York. 
He gets fifteen dollars a half-hour.'' 
</p><p>"Then I simply can't take from him!'' exclaimed 
Mildred, before she thought.  "That's frightful!'' 
</p><p>"Isn't it, though?'' echoed Mrs. Belloc.  "I've 
heard his income is fifty thousand a year, what with 
lessons and coaching and odds and ends.  There's a lot 
of them that do well, because so many fool women with 
nothing to do cultivate their voices&mdash;when they can't 
sing a little bit.  But he tops them all.  I don't see 
how <hi rend="italic">any</hi> teacher can put fifteen dollars of value 
into 
half an hour.  But I suppose he does, or he wouldn't 
get it.  Still, his may be just another case of New York 
nerve.  This is the biggest bluff town in the world, I 
do believe.  Here, you can get away with anything, I 
don't care what it is, if only you bluff hard enough.'' 
</p><p>As there was no reason for delay and many reasons 
against it, Mildred went at once to the address on the 
card Jennings had left.  She found Mrs. Howell 
Brindley installed in a plain comfortable apartment in 
Fifty-ninth Street, overlooking the park and high 
enough to make the noise of the traffic endurable.  A 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0172" n="159"/> 
Swedish maid, prepossessingly white and clean, ushered 
her into the little drawing-room, which was furnished 
with more simplicity and individual taste than is usual 
anywhere in New York, cursed of the mania for useless 
and tasteless showiness.  There were no messy draperies, 
no fussy statuettes, vases, gilt boxes, and the like. 
Mildred awaited the entrance of Mrs. Brindley hopefully. 
</p><p>She was not disappointed.  Presently in came a 
quietly-dressed, frank-looking woman of a young forty 
&mdash;a woman who had by no means lost her physical 
freshness, but had gained charm of another and more 
enduring kind.  As she came forward with extended 
but not overeager hand, she said: 
</p><p>"I was expecting you, Mrs. Siddall&mdash;that is, Miss 
Stevens.'' 
</p><p>"Mr. Jennings did not say when I was to come.  If 
I am disturbing you&mdash;'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley hastened to assure her that her visit 
was quite convenient.  "I must have someone to share 
the expense of this apartment with me, and I want the 
matter settled.  Mr. Jennings has explained about you 
to me, and now that I've seen you&mdash;'' here she smiled 
charmingly&mdash;"I am ready to say that it is for you to 
say.'' 
</p><p>Mildred did not know how to begin.  She looked at 
Mrs. Brindley with appeal in her troubled young 
eyes. 
</p><p>"You no doubt wish to know something about me,'' 
said Mrs. Brindley.  "My husband was a composer&mdash; 
a friend of Mr. Jennings.  He died two years ago. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0173" n="160"/> 
I am here in New York to teach the piano.  What the 
lessons will bring, with my small income, will enable me 
to live&mdash;if I can find someone to help out at the 
expenses here.  As I understand it, you are willing to 
pay forty dollars a week, I to run the house, pay all 
the bills, and so on&mdash;all, of course, if you wish to come 
here.'' 
</p><p>Mildred made a not very successful attempt to conceal 
her embarrassment. 
</p><p>"Perhaps you would like to look at the apartment?'' 
suggested Mrs. Brindley. 
</p><p>"Thank you, yes,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>The tour of the apartment&mdash;two bedrooms, dining-room, kitchen, sitting-room, large bath-room, drawing-room&mdash;took only a few minutes, but Mildred and Mrs. 
Brindley contrived to become much better acquainted. 
Said Mildred, when they were in the drawing-room 
again: 
</p><p>"It's most attractive&mdash;just what I should like. 
What&mdash;how much did Mr. Jennings say?'' 
</p><p>"Forty dollars a week.''  She colored slightly and 
spoke with the nervousness of one not in the habit of 
discussing money matters.  "I do not see how I could 
make it less.  That is the fair share of the&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"Oh, I think that is most reasonable,'' interrupted 
Mildred.  "And I wish to come.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley gave an almost childlike sigh of relief 
and smiled radiantly.  "Then it's settled,'' said she. 
"I've been so nervous about it.''  She looked at Mildred 
with friendly understanding.  "I think you and I are 
somewhat alike about practical things.  You've not had 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0174" n="161"/> 
much experience, either, have you?  I judge so from 
the fact that Mr. Jennings is looking after everything 
for you.'' 
</p><p>"I've had no experience at all,'' said Mildred. 
"That is why I'm hesitating.  I'm wondering if I can 
afford to pay so much.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley laughed.  "Mr. Jennings wished to 
fix it at sixty a week, but I insisted that forty was 
enough,'' said she. 
</p><p>Mildred colored high with embarrassment.  How 
much did Mrs. Brindley know?&mdash;or how little?  She 
stammered:  "Well, if Mr. Jennings says it is all right, 
I'll come.'' 
</p><p>"You'll let me know to-morrow?  You can telephone 
Mr. Jennings.'' 
</p><p>"Yes, I'll let you know to-morrow.  I'm almost sure 
I'll come.  In fact, I'm quite sure.  And&mdash;I think we 
shall get on well together.'' 
</p><p>"We can help each other,'' said Mrs. Brindley.  "I 
don't care for anything in the world but music.'' 
</p><p>"I want to be that way,'' said Mildred.  "I shall be 
that way.'' 
</p><p>"It's the only sure happiness&mdash;to care for something, 
for some <hi rend="italic">thing</hi>,'' said Mrs. Brindley.  "People 
die, or disappoint one, or become estranged.  But when 
one centers on some kind of work, it gives pleasure 
always&mdash;more and more pleasure.'' 
</p><p>"I am so afraid I haven't voice enough, or of the 
right kind,'' said Mildred.  "Mr. Jennings is going 
to try me on Saturday.  Really I've no right to settle 
anything until he has given his opinion.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0175" n="162"/>  
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley smiled with her eyes only, and Mildred 
wondered. 
</p><p>"If he should say that I wouldn't do,'' she went on, 
"I'd not know which way to turn.'' 
</p><p>"But he'll not say that,'' said Mrs. Brindley.  "You 
can sing, can't you?  You have sung?'' 
</p><p>"Oh, yes.'' 
</p><p>"Then you'll be accepted by him.  And it will take 
him a long time to find out whether you'll do for a professional.'' 
</p><p>"I'm afraid I sing very badly.'' 
</p><p>"That will not matter.  You'll sing better than at 
least half of Jennings's pupils.'' 
</p><p>"Then he doesn't take only those worth while?'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley looked amused.  "How would he live 
if he did that?  It's a teacher's business to teach. 
Learning&mdash;that's the pupil's lookout.  If teachers 
taught only those who could and would learn, how would 
they live?'' 
</p><p>"Then I'll not know whether I'll do!'' exclaimed Mildred. 
</p><p>"You'll have to find out for yourself,'' said Mrs. 
Brindley.  "No one can tell you.  Anyone's opinion 
might be wrong.  For example, I've known Jennings, 
who is a very good judge, to be wrong&mdash;both ways.'' 
Hesitatingly:  "Why not sing for me?  I'd like to 
hear.'' 
</p><p>"Would you tell me what you honestly thought?'' 
said Mildred. 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley laughingly shook her head. 
Mildred liked her honesty.  "Then it'd be useless to 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0176" n="163"/>
sing for you,'' said she.  "I'm not vain about my voice. 
I'd simply like to make a living by it, if I could.  I'll 
even confess that there are many things I care for more 
than for music.  Does that prove that I can never sing 
professionally?'' 
</p><p>"No, indeed,'' Mrs. Brindley assured her.  "It'd be 
strange if a girl of your age cared exclusively for 
music.  The passion comes with the work, with progress, 
success.  And some of the greatest&mdash;that is, the most 
famous and best paid&mdash;singers never care much about 
music, except as a vanity, and never understand it.  A 
singer means a person born with a certain shape of 
mouth and throat, a certain kind of vocal chords.  The 
rest may be natural or acquired.  It's the instrument 
that makes the singer, not brains or temperament.'' 
</p><p>"Do let me sing for you,'' said Mildred.  "I think 
it will help me.'' 
</p><p>Between them they chose a little French song&mdash; 
"Chanson d'Antonine''&mdash;and Mrs. Brindley insisted on 
her playing her own accompaniment.  "I wish to 
listen,'' said she, "and I can't if I play.'' 
</p><p>Mildred was surprised at her own freedom from 
nervousness.  She sang neither better nor worse than usual 
&mdash;sang in the clear and pleasant soprano which she 
flattered herself was not unmusical.  When she finished she 
said: 
</p><p>"That's about as I usually sing.  What do you 
think?'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley reflected before she replied:  "I 
<hi rend="italic">believe</hi> it's worth trying.  If I were you, I should 
keep on 
trying, no matter what anyone said.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0177" n="164"/>   
</p><p>Mildred was instantly depressed.  "You think Mr. 
Jennings may reject me?'' she asked. 
</p><p>"I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> he will not,'' replied Mrs. 
Brindley.  "Not 
as long as you can pay for the lessons.  But I was 
thinking of the real thing&mdash;of whether you could win 
out as a singer.'' 
</p><p>"And you don't think I can?'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"On the contrary, I believe you can,'' replied Mrs. 
Brindley.  "A singer means so much besides singing. 
The singing is the smallest part of it.  You'll understand 
when you get to work.  I couldn't explain now. 
But I can say that you ought to go ahead.'' 
</p><p>Mildred, who had her share of vanity, had hoped for 
some enthusiasm.  Mrs. Brindley's judicial tone was a 
severe blow.  She felt a little resentful, began to cast 
about for vanity-consoling reasons for Mrs. Brindley's 
restraint.  "She means well,'' she said to herself, "but 
she's probably just a tiny bit jealous.  She's not so 
young as she once was, and she hasn't the faintest hope 
of ever being anything more than a piano-teacher.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley showed that she had more than an 
inkling of Mildred's frame of mind by going on to say 
in a gentle, candid way:  "I want to help you.  So 
I shall be careful not to encourage you to believe too 
much in what you have.  That would prevent you from 
getting what you need.  You must remember, you are 
no longer a drawing-room singer, but a candidate for 
the profession.  That's a very different thing.'' 
</p><p>Mildred saw that she was mistaken, that Mrs. Brindley 
was honest and frank and had doubtless told her the 
exact truth.  But her vanity remained sore.  Never be-
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0178" n="165"/>  
fore had anyone said any less of her singing than that 
it was wonderful, marvelous, equal to a great deal that 
passed for fine in grand opera.  She had known 
that this was exaggeration, but she had not known how 
grossly exaggerated.  Thus, this her first experience 
of the professional attitude was galling.  Only her 
unusual good sense saved her from being angry with Mrs. 
Brindley.  And it was that same good sense that moved 
her presently to try to laugh at herself.  With a brave 
attempt to smile gayly she said: 
</p><p>"You don't realize how you've taken me down.  I 
had no idea I was so conceited about my singing.  I 
can't truthfully say I like your frankness, but there's 
a part of me that's grateful to you for it, and when I 
get over feeling hurt, I'll be grateful through and 
through.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley's face lighted up beautifully.  "You'll 
<hi rend="italic">do!</hi>'' she cried.  "I'm sure you'll do.  I've been 
waiting 
and watching to see how you would take my criticism. 
That's the test&mdash;how they take criticism.  If 
they don't take it at all, they'll not go very far, no 
matter how talented they are.  If they take it as you've 
taken it, there's hope&mdash;great hope.  Now, I'm not 
afraid to tell you that you sang splendidly for an 
amateur&mdash;that you surprised me.'' 
</p><p>"Don't spoil it all,'' said Mildred.  "You were 
right; I can't sing.'' 
</p><p>"Not for grand opera, not for comic opera even,'' 
replied Mrs. Brindley.  "But you will sing, and sing 
well, in one or the other, if you work.'' 
</p><p>"You really mean that?'' said Mildred. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0179" n="166"/>  
</p><p>"If you work intelligently and persistently,'' said 
Mrs. Brindley.  "That's a big if&mdash;as you'll discover 
in a year or so.'' 
</p><p>"You'll see,'' said Mildred confidently.  "Why, I've 
nothing else to do, and no other hope.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley's smile had a certain sadness in it. 
She said: 
</p><p>"It's the biggest if in all this world.'' </p>

<p>AT Mrs. Belloc's a telephone message from Jennings 
was awaiting her; he would call at a quarter-past eight 
and would detain Miss Stevens only a moment.  And 
at eight fifteen exactly he rang the bell.  This time 
Mildred was prepared; she refused to be disconcerted by 
his abrupt manner and by his long sharp nose that 
seemed to warn away, to threaten away, even to thrust 
away any glance seeking to investigate the rest of his 
face or his personality.  She looked at him candidly, 
calmly, and seeingly.  Seeingly.  With eyes that saw 
as they had never seen before.  Perhaps from the death 
of her father, certainly from the beginning of Siddall's 
courtship, Mildred had been waking up.  There is a 
part of our nature&mdash;the active and aggressive part&mdash; 
that sleeps all our lives long or becomes atrophied if 
we lead lives of ease and secure dependence.  It is the 
important part of us, too&mdash;the part that determines 
character.  The thing that completed the awakening 
of Mildred was her acquaintance with Mrs. Belloc. 
That positive and finely-poised lady fascinated her, 
influenced her powerfully&mdash;gave her just what she 
needed at the particular moment.  The vital moments 
in life are not the crises over which shallow people 
linger, but are the moments where we met and absorbed 
the ideas that enabled us to weather these crises.  The 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0181" n="168"/> 
acquaintance with Mrs. Belloc was one of those vital 
moments; for, Mrs. Belloc's personality&mdash;her look and 
manner, what she said and the way she said it&mdash;was a 
proffer to Mildred of invaluable lessons which her 
awakening character eagerly absorbed.  She saw Jennings 
as he was.  She decided that he was of common 
origin, that his vanity was colossal and aquiver throughout 
with sensitiveness; that he belonged to the familiar 
type of New-Yorker who succeeds by bluffing.  Also, 
she saw or felt a certain sexlessness or indifference to 
sex&mdash;and this she later understood.  Men whose occupation 
compels them constantly to deal with women go 
to one extreme or the other&mdash;either become acutely 
sensitive to women as women or become utterly indifferent, 
unless their highly discriminated taste is appealed 
to&mdash;which cannot happen often.  Jennings, teaching 
only women because only women spending money they 
had not earned and could not earn would tolerate 
his terms and his methods, had, as much through 
necessity as through inclination, gone to the extreme of 
lack of interest in all matters of sex.  One look at him 
and the woman who had come with the idea of offering 
herself in full or part payment for lessons drooped in 
instinctive discouragement. 
</p><p>Jennings hastened to explain to Mildred that she need 
not hesitate about closing with Mrs. Brindley.  "Your 
lessons are arranged for,'' said he.  "There has been 
put in the Plaza Trust Company to your credit the sum 
of five thousand dollars.  This gives you about a hundred 
dollars a week for your board and other personal 
expenses.  If that is not enough, you will let me know. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0182" n="169"/> 
But I estimated that it would be enough.  I do not think 
it wise for young women entering upon the preparation 
for a serious career to have too much money.'' 
</p><p>"It is more than enough,'' murmured the girl.  "I 
know nothing about those things, but it seems to me&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"You can use as little of it as you like,'' interrupted 
Jennings, rising. 
</p><p>Mildred felt as though she had been caught and 
exposed in a hypocritical protest.  Jennings was holding 
out something toward her.  She took it, and he went 
on: 
</p><p>"That's your check-book.  The bank will send you 
statements of your account, and will notify you when 
any further sums are added.  Now, I have nothing 
more to do with your affairs&mdash;except, of course, the 
artistic side&mdash;your development as a singer.  You've 
not forgotten your appointment?'' 
</p><p>"No,'' said Mildred, like a primary school-child 
before a formidable teacher. 
</p><p>"Be prompt, please.  I make no reduction for 
lessons wholly or partly missed.  The half-hour I shall 
assign to you belongs to you.  If you do not use it, 
that is your affair.  At first you will probably be like 
all women&mdash;careless about your appointments, coming 
with lessons unprepared, telephoning excuses.  But if 
you are serious you will soon fall into the routine.'' 
"I shall try to be regular,'' murmured Mildred. 
</p><p>Jennings apparently did not hear.  "I'm on my way 
to the opera-house,'' said he.  "One of my old pupils 
is appearing in a new r&ocirc;le, and she is nervous.  Good 
night.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0183" n="170"/>
</p><p>Once more that swift, quiet exit, followed almost 
instantaneously by the sound of wheels rolling away. 
Never had she seen such rapidity of motion without loss 
of dignity.  "Yes, he's a fraud,'' she said to herself, 
"but he's a good one.'' 
</p><p>The idea of a career had now become less indefinite. 
It was still without any attraction&mdash;not because of the 
toil it involved, for that made small impression upon 
her who had never worked and had never seen anyone 
work, but because a career meant cutting herself off 
from everything she had been brought up to regard as 
fit and proper for a lady.  She was ashamed of this; 
she did not admit its existence even to herself, and in 
her talks with Baird about the career she had professed 
exactly the opposite view.  Yet there it was&mdash;nor need 
she have been ashamed of a feeling that is instilled into 
women of her class from babyhood as part of their 
ladylike education.  The career had not become definite. 
She could not imagine herself out on a stage in some 
sort of a costume, with a painted face, singing before 
an audience.  Still, the career was less indefinite than 
when it had no existence beyond Stanley Baird's enthusiasm 
and her own whipped-up pretense of enthusiasm. 
</p><p>She shrank from the actual start, but at the same 
time was eager for it.  Inaction began to fret her 
nerves, and she wished to be doing something to show 
her appreciation of Stanley Baird's generosity.  She 
telephoned Mrs. Brindley that she would come in the 
morning, and then she told her landlady. 
</p><p>Mrs. Belloc was more than regretful; she was 
distressed.  Said she:  "I've taken a tremendous fancy 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0184" n="171"/> 
to you, and I hate to give you up.  I'd do most anything 
to keep you.'' 
</p><p>Mildred explained that her work compelled her to 
go. 
</p><p>"That's very interesting,'' said Mrs. Belloc.  "If I 
were a few years younger, and hadn't spent all my energy 
in teaching school and putting through that marriage, 
I'd try to get on the stage, myself.  I don't want 
to lose sight of you.'' 
</p><p>"Oh, I'll come to see you from time to time.'' 
</p><p>"No, you won't,'' said Mrs. Belloc practically.  "No 
more than I'd come to see you.  Our lives lie in different 
directions, and in New York that means we'll never 
have time to meet.  But we may be thrown together 
again, some time.  As I've got a twenty years' lease on 
this house, I guess you'll have no trouble in finding 
me.  I suppose I could look you up through Professor 
Jennings?'' 
</p><p>"Yes,'' said Mildred.  Then impulsively, "Mrs. 
Belloc, there's a reason why I'd like to change without 
anyone's knowing what has become of me&mdash;I mean, 
anyone that might be&mdash;watching me.'' 
</p><p>"I understand perfectly,'' said Mrs. Belloc with a 
ready sympathy that made Mildred appreciate the 
advantages of the friendship of unconventional, knock-about people.  "Nothing could be easier.  You've got 
no luggage but that bag.  I'll take it up to the 
Grand Central Station and check it, and bring the 
check back here.  You can send for it when you 
please.'' 
</p><p>"But what about me?'' said Mildred. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0185" n="172"/>  
</p><p>"I was coming to that.  You walk out of here, say, 
about half an hour after I go in the taxi.  You walk 
through to the corner of Lexington Avenue and Thirty-seventh Street&mdash;there aren't any cabs to be had there. 
I'll be waiting in the taxi, and we'll make a dash up the 
East Side and I can drop you at some quiet place in the 
park and go on&mdash;and you can walk to your new 
address.  How does that strike you?'' 
</p><p>Mildred expressed her admiration.  The plan was 
carried out, as Mrs. Belloc&mdash;a born genius at all forms 
of intrigue&mdash;had evolved it in perfection on the spur 
of the moment.  As they went up the far East Side, 
Mrs. Belloc, looking back through the little rear 
window, saw a taxi a few blocks behind them.  "We haven't 
given them the slip yet,'' said she, "but we will in the 
park.''  They entered the park at East Ninetieth 
Street, crossed to the West Drive.  Acting on Mrs. 
Belloc's instructions, the motorman put on full speed&mdash; 
with due regard to the occasional policeman.  At a 
sharp turning near the Mall, when the taxi could be 
seen from neither direction, he abruptly stopped.  Out 
sprang Mildred and disappeared behind the bushes 
completely screening the walk from the drive.  At once 
the taxi was under-way again.  She, waiting where the 
screen of bushes was securely thick, saw the taxi that 
had followed them in the East Side flash by&mdash;in pursuit 
of Mrs. Belloc alone. 
</p><p>She was free&mdash;at least until some mischance uncovered 
her to the little general.  At Mrs. Brindley's she 
found a note awaiting her&mdash;a note from Stanley 
Baird: 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0186" n="173"/> 
 
DEAR MILDRED: 
</p><p>I'm of for the Far West, and probably shall not be in 
town again until the early summer.  The club forwards 
my mail and repeats telegrams as marked.  Go in and win, 
and don't hesitate to call on me if you need me.  No false 
pride, <hi rend="italic">please!</hi>  I'm getting out of the way because 
it's 
obviously best for the present. 
                                          STANLEY. 
 
</p><p>As she finished, her sense of freedom was complete. 
She had not realized how uneasy she was feeling about 
Stanley.  She did not doubt his generosity, did not 
doubt that he genuinely intended to leave her free, and 
she believed that his delicacy was worthy of his 
generosity.  Still, she was constantly fearing lest 
circumstances should thrust them both&mdash;as much against his 
will as hers&mdash;into a position in which she would have 
to choose between seeming, not to say being, ungrateful, 
and playing the hypocrite, perhaps basely, with him. 
The little general eluded, Stanley voluntarily removed; 
she was indeed free.  Now she could work with an un-troubled mind, could show Mrs. Brindley that intelligent 
and persistent work&mdash;her "biggest if in all the 
world''&mdash;was in fact a very simple matter. 
</p><p>She had not been settled at Mrs. Brindley's many 
hours before she discovered that not only was she free 
from all hindrances, but was to have a positive and great 
help.  Mrs. Brindley's talent for putting people at 
their ease was no mere drawing-room trick. 
</p><p>She made Mildred feel immediately at home, as she 
had not felt at home since her mother introduced James 
Presbury into their house at Hanging Rock.  Mrs. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0187" n="174"/>  
Brindley was absolutely devoid of pretenses.  When 
Mildred spoke to her of this quality in her she said: 
</p><p>"I owe that to my husband.  I was brought up like 
everybody else&mdash;to be more or less of a poser and a 
hypocrite.  In fact, I think there was almost nothing 
genuine about me.  My husband taught me to be myself, 
to be afraid of nobody's opinion, to show myself 
just as I was and to let people seek or avoid me as they 
saw fit.  He was that sort of man himself.'' 
</p><p>"He must have been a remarkable man,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"He was,'' replied Mrs. Brindley.  "But not 
attractive&mdash;at least not to me.  Our marriage was a 
mistake.  We quarreled whenever we were not at work 
with the music.  If he had not died, we should have 
been divorced.''  She smiled merrily.  "Then he would 
have hired me as his musical secretary, and we'd have 
got on beautifully.'' 
</p><p>Mildred was still thinking of Mrs. Brindley's freedom 
from pretense.  "I've never dared be myself,'' 
confessed she.  "I don't know what myself really is like. 
I was thinking the other day how for one reason and 
another I've been a hypocrite all my life.  You see, 
I've always been a dependent&mdash;have always had to 
please someone in order to get what I wanted.'' 
</p><p>"You can never be yourself until you have an 
independent income, however small,'' said Mrs. Brindley. 
"I've had that joy only since my husband died.  It's 
as well that I didn't have it sooner.  One is the better 
for having served an apprenticeship at self-repression 
and at pretending to virtues one has not.  Only those 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0188" n="175"/>
who earn their freedom know how to use it.  If I had 
had it ten or fifteen years ago I'd have been an intolerable 
tyrant, making everyone around me unhappy and 
therefore myself.  The ideal world would be one where 
everyone was born free and never knew anything else. 
Then, no one being afraid or having to serve, everyone 
would have to be considerate in order to get himself 
tolerated.'' 
</p><p>"I wonder if I really ever shall be able to earn a 
living?'' sighed Mildred. 
</p><p>"You must decide that whatever you can make shall 
be for you a living,'' said the older woman.  "I have 
lived on my fixed income, which is under two thousand 
a year.  And I am ready to do it again rather than 
tolerate anything or anybody that does not suit me.'' 
</p><p>"I shall have to be extremely careful,'' laughed 
Mildred.  "I shall be a dreadful hypocrite with you.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley smiled; but underneath, Mildred saw 
&mdash;or perhaps felt&mdash;that her new friend was indeed not 
one to be trifled with.  She said: 
</p><p>"You and I will get on.  We'll let each other alone. 
We have to be more or less intimate, but we'll never be 
familiar.'' 
</p><p>After a time she discovered that Mrs. Brindley's first 
name was Cyrilla, but Mrs. Brindley and Miss Stevens 
they remained to each other for a long time&mdash;until 
circumstances changed their accidental intimacy into 
enduring friendship.  Not to anticipate, in the course 
of that same conversation Mildred said: 
</p><p>"If there is anything about me&mdash;about my life&mdash; 
that you wish me to explain, I shall be glad to do so.'' 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0189" n="176"/>
</p><p>"I know all I wish to know,'' replied Cyrilla 
Brindley.  "Your face and your manner and your way of 
speaking tell me all the essentials.'' 
</p><p>"Then you must not think it strange when I say I 
wish no one to know anything about me.'' 
</p><p>"It will be impossible for you entirely to avoid 
meeting people,'' said Cyrilla.  "You must have some simple 
explanation about yourself, or you will attract attention 
and defeat your object.'' 
</p><p>"Lead people to believe that I'm an orphan&mdash;perhaps 
of some obscure family&mdash;who is trying to get up 
in the world.  That is practically the truth.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley laughed.  "Quite enough for New 
York,'' said she.  "It is not interested in facts.  All 
the New-Yorker asks of you is, `Can you pay your bills 
and help me pay mine?' '' 
</p><p>Competent men are rare; but, thanks to the advantage 
of the male sex in having to make the struggle for 
a living, they are not so rare as competent women. 
Mrs. Brindley was the first competent woman Mildred 
had ever known.  She had spent but a few hours with 
her before she began to appreciate what a bad atmosphere 
she had always breathed&mdash;bad for a woman who 
has her way to make in the world, or indeed for any 
woman not willing to be content as mere more or less 
shiftless, more or less hypocritical and pretentious, 
dependent and parasite.  Mrs. Brindley&mdash;well bred and 
well educated&mdash;knew all the little matters which Mildred 
had been taught to regard as the whole of a lady's 
education.  But Mildred saw that these trifles were but 
a trifling incident in Mrs. Brindley's knowledge.  She 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0190" n="177"/> 
knew real things, this woman who was a thorough-going 
housekeeper and who trebled her income by giving 
music lessons a few hours a day to such pupils as she 
thought worth the teaching.  When she spoke, she always 
said something one of the first things noticed 
by Mildred, who, being too lazy to think except as her 
naturally good mind insisted on exercising itself, 
usually talked simply to kill time and without any idea of 
getting anywhere.  But while Cyrilla&mdash;without in the 
least intending it&mdash;roused her to a painful sense of 
her own limitations, she did not discourage her.  Mildred 
also began to feel that in this new atmosphere of 
ideas, of work, of accomplishment, she would rapidly 
develop into a different sort of person.  It was 
extremely fortunate for her, thought she, that she was 
living with such a person as Cyrilla Brindley.  In the 
old atmosphere, or with any taint of it, she would have 
been unable to become a serious person.  She would 
simply have dawdled along, twaddling about "art'' and 
seriousness and careers and sacrifice, content with the 
amateur's methods and the amateur's results&mdash;and 
deluding herself that she was making progress.  Now&mdash; 
It was as different as public school from private school 
&mdash;public school where the mind is rudely stimulated, 
private school where it is sedulously mollycoddled.  She 
had come out of the hothouse into the open. 
</p><p>At first she thought that Jennings was to be as great 
a help to her as Cyrilla Brindley.  Certainly if ever 
there was a man with the air of a worker and a place 
with the air of a workshop, that man and that place 
were Eugene Jennings and his studio in Carnegie Hall. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0191" n="178"/> 
When Mildred entered, on that Saturday morning, at 
exactly half-past ten, Jennings&mdash;in a plain if elegant 
house-suit&mdash;looked at her, looked at the clock, stopped 
a girl in the midst of a burst of tremulous noisy melody. 
</p><p>"That will do, Miss Bristow,'' said he.  "You have 
never sung it worse.  You do not improve.  Another 
lesson like this, and we shall go back and begin all over 
again.'' 
</p><p>The girl, a fattish, "temperamental'' blonde, burst 
into tears. 
</p><p>"Kindly take that out into the hall,'' said Jennings 
coldly.  "Your time is up.  We cannot waste Miss 
Stevens's time with your hysterics.'' 
</p><p>Miss Bristow switched from tears to fury.  "You 
brute!  You beast!'' she shrieked, and flung herself 
out of the room, slamming the door after her.  Jennings 
took a book from a pile upon a table, opened it, 
and set it on a music-stand.  Evidently Miss Bristow 
was forgotten&mdash;indeed, had passed out of his mind at 
half-past ten exactly, not to enter it again until she 
should appear at ten on Monday morning.  He said 
to Mildred: 
</p><p>"Now, we'll see what you can do.  Begin.'' 
</p><p>"I'm a little nervous,'' said Mildred with a shy 
laugh.  "If you don't mind, I'd like to wait till I've 
got used to my surroundings.'' 
</p><p>Jennings looked at her.  The long sharp nose 
seemed to be rapping her on the forehead like a wood-pecker's beak on the bark of the tree.  "Begin,'' he 
said, pointing to the book. 
</p><p>Mildred flushed angrily.  "I shall not begin until 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0192" n="179"/>
I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> begin,'' said she.  The time to show this man 
that 
he could not treat her brutally was at the outset. 
</p><p>Jennings opened the door into the hall.  "Good 
day, Miss Stevens,'' he said with his abrupt bow. 
</p><p>Mildred looked at him; he looked at her.  Her lip 
trembled, the hot tears flooded and blinded her eyes. 
She went unsteadily to the music-stand and tried to see 
the notes of the exercises.  Jennings closed the door 
and seated himself at the far end of the room.  She 
began&mdash;a ridiculous attempt.  She stopped, gritted 
her teeth, began again.  Once more the result was 
absurd; but this time she was able to keep on, not 
improving, but maintaining her initial off-key quavering. 
She stopped. 
</p><p>"You see,'' said she.  "Shall I go on?'' 
</p><p>"Don't stop again until I tell you to, please,'' said 
he. 
</p><p>She staggered and stumbled and somersaulted through 
two pages of <hi rend="italic">do-re-me-fa-sol-la-si</hi>.  Then he held 
up 
his finger. 
</p><p>"Enough,'' said he. 
</p><p>Silence, an awful silence.  She recalled what Mrs. 
Belloc had told her about him, what Mrs. Brindley had 
implied.  But she got no consolation.  She said timidly: 
</p><p>"Really, Mr. Jennings, I can do better than that. 
Won't you let me try a song?'' 
</p><p>"God forbid!'' said he.  "You can't stand.  You 
can't breathe.  You can't open your mouth.  Naturally, 
you can't sing.'' 
</p><p>She dropped to a chair. 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0193" n="180"/> 
</p><p>"Take the book, and go over the same thing, 
sitting,'' said he. 
</p><p>She began to remove her wraps. 
</p><p>"Just as you are,'' he commanded.  "Try to forget 
yourself.  Try to forget me.  Try to forget what a 
brute I am, and what a wonderful singer you are.  Just 
open your mouth and throw the notes out.'' 
</p><p>She was rosy with rage.  She was reckless.  She 
sang.  At the end of three pages he stopped her with 
an enthusiastic hand-clapping.  "Good!  Good!'' he 
cried.  "I'll take you.  I'll make a singer of you. 
Yes, yes, there's something to work on.'' 
</p><p>The door opened.  A tall, thin woman with many 
jewels and a superb fur wrap came gliding in.  Jennings 
looked at the clock.  The hands pointed to eleven. 
Said he to Mildred: 
</p><p>"Take that book with you.  Practice what you've 
done to-day.  Learn to keep your mouth open.  We'll 
go into that further next time.''  He was holding the 
door open for her.  As she passed out, she heard him 
say: 
</p><p>"Ah, Mrs. Roswell.  We'll go at that third song 
first.'' 
</p><p>The door closed.  Reviewing all that had occurred, 
Mildred decided that she must revise her opinion of 
Jennings.  A money-maker he no doubt was.  And 
why not?  Did he not have to live?  But a teacher also, 
and a great teacher.  Had he not destroyed her vanity 
at one blow, demolished it?&mdash;yet without discouraging 
her.  And he went straight to the bottom of things&mdash; 
very different from any of the teachers she used to have 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0194" n="181"/> 
when she was posing in drawing-rooms as a person with 
a voice equal to the most difficult opera, if only she 
weren't a lady and therefore not forced to be a professional 
singing person.  Yes, a great teacher&mdash;and in 
deadly earnest.  He would permit no trifling!  How 
she would have to work! 
</p><p>And she went to work with an energy she would not 
have believed she possessed.  He instructed her 
minutely in how to stand, in how to breathe, in how to open 
her mouth and keep it open, in how to relax her throat 
and leave it relaxed.  He filled every second of her 
half-hour; she had never before realized how much time 
half an hour was, how use could be made of every one 
of its eighteen hundred seconds.  She went to hear 
other teachers give lessons, and she understood why 
Jennings could get such prices, could treat his pupils 
as he saw fit.  She became an extravagant admirer of 
him as a teacher, thought him a genius, felt confident 
that he would make a great singer of her.  With the 
second lesson she began to progress rapidly.  In a few 
weeks she amazed herself.  At last she was really singing. 
Not in a great way, but in the beginnings of a 
great way.  Her voice had many times the power of 
her drawing-room days.  Her notes were full and 
round, and came without an effort.  Her former ideas 
of what constituted facial and vocal expression now 
seemed ridiculous to her.  She was now singing without 
making those dreadful faces which she had once 
thought charming and necessary.  Her lower register, 
always her best, was almost perfect.  Her middle 
register&mdash;the test part of a voice&mdash;was showing signs 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0195" n="182"/> 
of strength and steadiness and evenness.  And she was 
fast getting a real upper register, as distinguished from 
the forced and shrieky high notes that pass as an upper 
register with most singers, even opera singers.  After 
a month of this marvelous forward march, she sang for 
Mrs. Brindley&mdash;sang the same song she had essayed 
at their first meeting.  When she finished, Mrs. Brindley said: 
</p><p>"Yes, you've done wonders.  I've been noticing your 
improvement as you practiced.  You certainly have a 
very different voice and method from those you had a 
month ago,'' and so on through about five minutes of 
critical and discriminating praise. 
</p><p>Mildred listened, wondering why her dissatisfaction, 
her irritation, increased as Mrs. Brindley praised on 
and on.  Beyond question Cyrilla was sincere, and was 
saying even more than Mildred had hoped she would 
say.  Yet&mdash;  Mildred sat moodily measuring off 
octaves on the keyboard of the piano.  If she had been 
looking at her friend's face she would have flared out 
in anger; for Cyrilla Brindley was taking advantage 
of her abstraction to observe her with friendly sympathy 
and sadness.  Presently she concealed this candid 
expression and said: 
</p><p>"You are satisfied with your progress, aren't you, 
Miss Stevens?'' 
</p><p>Mildred flared up angrily.  "Certainly!'' replied 
she.  "How could I fail to be?'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley did not answer&mdash;perhaps because she 
thought no answer was needed or expected.  But to 
Mildred her silence somehow seemed a denial. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0196" n="183"/> 
</p><p>"If you can only keep what you've got&mdash;and go 
on,'' said Mrs. Brindley. 
</p><p>"Oh, I shall, never fear,'' retorted Mildred. 
</p><p>"But I do fear,'' said Mrs. Brindley.  "I think it's 
always well to fear until success is actually won.  And 
then there's the awful fear of not being able to hold 
it.'' 
</p><p>After a moment's silence Mildred, who could not hide 
away resentment against one she liked, said:  "Why 
aren't <hi rend="italic">you</hi> satisfied, Mrs. Brindley?'' 
</p><p>"But I am satisfied,'' protested Cyrilla.  "Only it 
makes me afraid to see <hi rend="italic">you</hi> so well satisfied.  I've 
seen 
that often in people first starting, and it's always 
dangerous.  You see, my dear, you've got a straight-away 
hundred miles to walk.  Can't you see that it would be 
possible for you to become too much elated by the way 
you walked the first part of the first mile?'' 
</p><p>"Why do you try to discourage me?'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley colored.  "I do it because I want to 
save you from despair a little later,'' said she.  "But 
that is foolish of me.  I shall only irritate you against 
me.  I'll not do it again.  And please don't ask my 
opinion.  If you do, I can't help showing exactly what 
I think.'' 
</p><p>"Then you don't think I've done well?'' cried Mildred. 
</p><p>"Indeed you have,'' replied Cyrilla warmly. 
</p><p>"Then I don't understand.  What <hi rend="italic">do</hi> you 
mean?'' 
</p><p>"I'll tell you, and then I'll stop and you must not ask 
my opinion again.  We live too close together to be 
able to afford to criticize each other.  What I meant 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0197" n="184"/>  
was this:  You have done well the first part of the great 
task that's before you.  If you had done it any less 
well, it would have been folly for you to go on.'' 
</p><p>"That is, what I've done doesn't amount to 
anything?  Mr. Jennings doesn't agree with you.'' 
</p><p>"Doubtless he's right,'' said Mrs. Brindley.  "At 
any rate, we all agree that you have shown that you 
have a voice.'' 
</p><p>She said this so simply and heartily that Mildred 
could not but be mollified.  Mrs. Brindley changed the 
subject to the song Mildred had sung, and Mildred 
stopped puzzling over the mystery of what she had 
meant by her apparently enthusiastic words, which had 
yet diffused a chill atmosphere of doubt. 
</p><p>She was doing her scales so well that she became 
impatient of such "tiresome child's play.''  And presently 
Jennings gave her songs, and did not discourage 
her when she talked of r&ocirc;les, of getting seriously at 
what, after all, she intended to do.  Then there came a 
week of vile weather, and Mildred caught a cold.  She 
neglected it.  Her voice left her.  Her tonsils swelled. 
She had a bad attack of ulcerated sore throat.  For 
nearly three weeks she could not take a single one of the 
lessons, which were, nevertheless, paid for.  Jennings 
rebuked her sharply. 
</p><p>"A singer has no right to be sick,'' said he. 
</p><p>"You have a cold yourself,'' retorted she. 
</p><p>"But I am not a singer.  I've nothing that interferes 
with my work.'' 
</p><p>"It's impossible not to take cold,'' said Mildred. 
"You are unreasonable with me.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0198" n="185"/>  
</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders.  "Go get well,'' he said. 
</p><p>The sore throat finally yielded to the treatment of 
Dr. Hicks, the throat-specialist.  His bill was seventy-five dollars.  But while the swelling in the tonsils 
subsided it did not depart.  She could take lessons again. 
Some days she sang as well as ever, and on those days 
Jennings was charming.  Other days she sang atrociously, 
and Jennings treated her as if she were doing 
it deliberately.  A third and worse state was that of 
the days when she in the same half-hour alternately 
sang well and badly.  On those days Jennings acted 
like a lunatic.  He raved up and down the studio, all 
but swearing at her.  At first she was afraid of him&mdash; 
withered under his scorn, feared he would throw open 
his door and order her out and forbid her ever to enter 
again.  But gradually she came to understand him&mdash; 
not enough to lose her fear of him altogether, but 
enough to lose the fear of his giving up so profitable a 
pupil. 
</p><p>The truth was that Jennings, like every man who 
succeeds at anything in this world, operated upon a 
system to which he rigidly adhered.  He was a man of 
small talent and knowledge, but of great, persistence 
and not a little common sense.  He had tried to be a 
singer, had failed because his voice was small and 
unreliable.  He had adopted teaching singing as a means 
of getting a living.  He had learned just enough about 
it to enable him to teach the technical elements&mdash;what 
is set down in the books.  By observing other and older 
teachers he had got together a teaching system that was 
as good&mdash;and as bad&mdash;as any, and this he dubbed 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0199" n="186"/>
the Jennings Method and proceeded to exploit as the 
only one worth while.  When that method was worked 
out and perfected, he ceased learning, ceased to give a 
thought to the professional side of his profession, just 
as most professional men do.  He would have resented 
a suggestion or a new idea as an attack upon the Jennings 
Method.  The overwhelming majority of the 
human race&mdash;indeed, all but a small handful&mdash;have 
this passion for stagnation, this ferocity against change. 
It is in large part due to laziness; for a new idea means 
work in learning it and in unlearning the old ideas 
that have been true until the unwelcome advent of the 
new.  In part also this resistance to the new idea arises 
from a fear that the new idea, if tolerated, will put one 
out of business, will set him adrift without any means of 
support.  The coachman hates the automobile, the 
hand-worker hates the machine, the orthodox preacher 
hates the heretic, the politician hates the reformer, the 
doctor hates the bacteriologist and the chemist, the old 
woman hates the new&mdash;all these in varying proportions 
according to the degree in which the iconoclast attacks 
laziness or livelihood.  Finally we all hate any and all 
new ideas because they seem to imply that we, who have 
held the old ideas, have been ignorant and stupid in so 
doing.  A new idea is an attack upon the vanity of 
everyone who has been a partisan of the old ideas and 
their established order. 
</p><p>Jennings, thoroughly human in thus closing his mind 
to all ideas about his profession, was equally human in 
that he had his mind and his senses opened full width 
to ideas on how to make more money.  If there had 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0200" n="187"/> 
been money in new ideas about teaching singing 
Jennings would not have closed to them.  But the money 
was all in studying and learning how better to handle 
the women&mdash;they were all women who came to him for 
instruction.  His common sense warned him at the outset 
that the obviously easygoing teacher would not long 
retain his pupils.  On the other hand, he saw that the 
really severe teacher would not retain his pupils, either. 
</p><p>Who were these pupils?  In the first place, they were 
all ignorant, for people who already know do not go 
to school to learn.  They had the universal delusion 
that a teacher can teach.  The fact is that a teacher 
is a well.  Some wells are full, others almost dry.  Some 
are so arranged that water cannot be got from them, 
others have attachments of various kinds, making the 
drawing of water more or less easy.  But not from the 
best well with the latest pump attachment can one get 
a drink unless one does the drinking oneself.  A teacher 
is rarely a well.  The pupil must not only draw the 
water, but also drink it, must not only teach himself, 
but also learn what he teaches.  Now we are all of us 
born thirsty for knowledge, and nearly all of us are 
born both capable of teaching ourselves and capable of 
learning what we teach, that is, of retaining and assimilating 
it.  There is such a thing as artificially feeding 
the mind, just as there is such a thing as artificially 
feeding the body; but while everyone knows that artificial 
feeding of the body is a success only to a limited 
extent and for a brief period, everyone believes that 
the artificial feeding of the mind is not only the best 
method, but the only method.  Nor does the discovery 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0201" n="188"/> 
that the mind is simply the brain, is simply a part of 
the body, subject to the body's laws, seem materially to 
have lessened this fatuous delusion. 
</p><p>Some of Jennings's pupils&mdash;not more than two of 
the forty-odd were in genuine earnest; that is, those two 
were educating themselves to be professional singers, 
were determined so to be, had limited time and means 
and endless capacity for work.  Others of the forty&mdash; 
about half-thought they were serious, though in fact 
the idea of a career was more or less hazy.  They were 
simply taking lessons and toiling aimlessly along, not 
less aimlessly because they indulged in vague talk and 
vaguer thought about a career.  The rest&mdash;the other 
half of the forty&mdash;were amusing themselves by taking 
singing lessons.  It killed time, it gave them a feeling 
of doing something, it gave them a reputation of being 
serious people and not mere idlers, it gave them an 
excuse for neglecting the domestic duties which they 
regarded as degrading&mdash;probably because to do them 
well requires study and earnest, hard work.  The Jennings 
singing lesson, at fifteen dollars a half-hour, was 
rather an expensive hypocrisy; but the women who 
used it as a cloak for idleness as utter as the mere 
yawners and bridgers and shoppers had rich husbands 
or fathers. 
</p><p>Thus it appears that the Jennings School was a perfect 
microcosm, as the scientists would say, of the human 
race&mdash;the serious very few, toiling more or less 
successfully toward a definite goal; the many, compelled to 
do something, and imagining themselves serious and 
purposeful as they toiled along toward nothing in par-
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0202" n="189"/>  
ticular but the next lesson&mdash;that is, the next day's 
appointed task; the utterly idle, fancying themselves 
busy and important when in truth they were simply a 
fraud and an expense. 
</p><p>Jennings got very little from the deeply and 
genuinely serious.  One of them he taught free, taking 
promissory notes for the lessons.  But he held on to 
them because when they finally did teach themselves 
to sing and arrived at fame, his would be part of the 
glory&mdash;and glory meant more and more pupils of 
the paying kinds.  His large income came from the 
other two kinds of pupils, the larger part of it from 
the kind that had no seriousness in them.  His problem 
was how to keep all these paying pupils and also keep 
his reputation as a teacher.  In solving that problem 
he evolved a method that was the true Jennings's method. 
Not in all New York, filled as it is with people living 
and living well upon the manipulation of the weaknesses 
of their fellow beings&mdash;not in all New York was there 
an adroiter manipulator than Eugene Jennings.  He 
was harsh to brutality when he saw fit to be so&mdash;or, 
rather, when he deemed it wise to be so.  Yet never 
had he lost a paying pupil through his harshness. 
These were fashionable women&mdash;most delicate, sensitive 
ladies&mdash;at whom he swore.  They wept, stayed on, 
advertised him as a "wonderful serious teacher who 
won't stand any nonsense and doesn't care a hang 
whether you stay or go&mdash;and he can teach absolutely 
anybody to sing!''  He knew how to be gentle without 
seeming to be so; he knew how to flatter without uttering 
a single word that did not seem to be reluctant praise 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0203" n="190"/>  
or savage criticism; he knew how to make a lady with 
a little voice work enough to make a showing that would 
spur her to keep on and on with him; he knew how 
to encourage a rich woman with no more song than a 
peacock until she would come to him three times a week 
for many years&mdash;and how he did make her pay for 
what he suffered in listening to the hideous squawkings 
and yelpings she inflicted upon him! 
</p><p>Did Jennings think himself a fraud?  No more than 
the next human being who lives by fraud.  Is there any 
trade or profession whose practitioners, in the bottom 
of their hearts, do not think they are living excusably 
and perhaps creditably?  The Jennings theory was that 
he was a great teacher; that there were only a very few 
serious and worth-while seekers of the singing art; 
that in order to live and to teach these few, he had to 
receive the others; that, anyhow, singing was a fine 
art for anyone to have and taking singing lessons made 
the worst voice a little less bad&mdash;or, at the least, singing 
was splendid for the health.  One of his favorite 
dicta was, "Every child should be taught singing&mdash; 
for its health, if for nothing else.''  And perhaps he 
was right!  At any rate, he made his forty to fifty 
thousand a year&mdash;and on days when he had a succession 
of the noisy, tuneless squawkers, he felt that he 
more than earned every cent of it. 
</p><p>Mildred did not penetrate far into the secret of the 
money-making branch of the Jennings method.  It was 
crude enough, too.  But are not all the frauds that 
fool the human race crude?  Human beings both cannot 
and will not look beneath surfaces.  All Mildred 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0204" n="191"/>  
learned was that Jennings did not give up paying pupils. 
She had not confidence enough in this discovery to put 
it to the test.  She did not dare disobey him or shirk&mdash; 
even when she was most disposed to do so.  But gradually 
she ceased from that intense application she had 
at first brought to her work.  She kept up the forms. 
She learned her lessons.  She did all that was asked. 
She seemed to be toiling as in the beginning.  In reality, 
she became by the middle of spring a mere lesson-taker. 
Her interest in clothes and in going about revived.  She 
saw in the newspapers that General Siddall had taken 
a party of friends on a yachting trip around the world, 
so she felt that she was no longer being searched for, 
at least not vigorously.  She became acquainted with 
smart, rich West Side women, taking lessons at 
Jennings's.  She amused herself going about with them and 
with the "musical'' men they attracted&mdash;amateur and 
semi-professional singers and players upon instruments. 
She drew Mrs. Brindley into their society.  They had 
little parties at the flat in Fifty-ninth Street&mdash;the most 
delightful little parties imaginable&mdash;dinners and suppers, 
music, clever conversations, flirtations of a harmless 
but fascinating kind.  If anyone had accused Mildred 
of neglecting her work, of forgetting her career, 
she would have grown indignant, and if Mrs. Brindley 
had overheard, she would have been indignant for her. 
Mildred worked as much as ever.  She was making 
excellent progress.  She was doing all that could be done. 
It takes time to develop a voice, to make an opera-singer. 
Forcing is dangerous, when it is not downright useless. 
</p><p>In May&mdash;toward the end of the month&mdash;Stanley 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0205" n="192"/>  
Baird returned.  Mildred, who happened to be in unusually 
good voice that day, sang for him at the Jennings 
studio, and he was enchanted.  As the last note died 
away he cried out to Jennings: 
</p><p>"She's a wonder, isn't she?'' 
</p><p>Jennings nodded.  "She's got a voice,'' said he. 
</p><p>"She ought to go on next year.'' 
</p><p>"Not quite that,'' said Jennings.  "We want to 
get that upper register right first.  And it's a young 
voice&mdash;she's very young for her age.  We must be 
careful not to strain it.'' 
</p><p>"Why, what's a voice for if not to sing with?'' said 
Stanley. 
</p><p>"A fine voice is a very delicate instrument,'' replied 
the teacher.  He added coldly, "You must let me judge 
as to what shall be done.'' 
</p><p>"Certainly, certainly,'' said Stanley in haste. 
</p><p>"She's had several colds this winter and spring,'' 
pursued Jennings.  "Those things are dangerous until 
the voice has its full growth.  She should have two 
months' complete rest.'' 
</p><p>Jennings was going away for a two months' vacation. 
He was giving this advice to all his pupils. 
</p><p>"You're right,'' said Baird.  "Did you hear, Mildred?'' 
</p><p>"But I hate to stop work,'' objected Mildred.  "I 
want to be doing something.  I'm very impatient of 
this long wait.'' 
</p><p>And honest she was in this protest.  She had no idea 
of the state of her own mind.  She fancied she was still 
as eager as ever for the career, as intensely interested 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0206" n="193"/> 
as ever in her work.  She did not dream of the real 
meaning of her content with her voice as it was, of 
her lack of uneasiness over the appalling fact that such 
voice as she had was unreliable, came and went for no 
apparent reason. 
</p><p>"Absolute rest for two months,'' declared Jennings 
grimly.  "Not a note until I return in August.'' 
</p><p>Mildred gave a resigned sigh. 
</p><p>There is much inveighing against hypocrisy, a vice 
unsightly rather than desperately wicked.  And in the 
excitement about it its dangerous, even deadly near 
kinsman, self-deception, escapes unassailed.  Seven 
cardinal sins; but what of the eighth?&mdash;the parent of 
all the others, the one beside which the children seem 
almost white? 
</p><p>During the first few weeks Mildred had been careful 
about spending money.  Economy she did not understand; 
how could she, when she had never had a lesson 
in it or a valuable hint about it?  So economy was 
impossible.  The only way in which such people can 
keep order in their finances is by not spending any 
money at all.  Mildred drew nothing, spent nothing. 
This, so long as she gave her whole mind to her work. 
But after the first great cold, so depressing, so subtly 
undermining, she began to go about, to think of, to 
need and to buy clothes, to spend money in a dozen 
necessary ways.  After all, she was simply borrowing 
the money.  Presently, she would be making a career, 
would be earning large sums.  She would pay back 
everything, with interest.  Stanley meant for her to 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0207" n="194"/>  
use the money.  Really, she ought to use it.  How 
would her career be helped by her going about looking 
a dowd and a frump?  She had always been used to the 
comforts of life.  If she deprived herself of them, she 
would surely get into a frame of mind where her work 
would suffer.  No, she must lead the normal life of a 
woman of her class.  To work all the time&mdash;why, as 
Jennings said, that took away all the freshness, made 
one stale and unfit.  A little distraction&mdash;always, of 
course, with musical people, people who talked and 
thought and did music&mdash;that sort of distraction was 
quite as much a part of her education as the singing 
lessons.  Mrs. Brindley, certainly a sensible and serious 
woman if ever there was one&mdash;Mrs. Brindley believed 
so, and it must be so. 
</p><p>After that illness and before she began to go about, 
she had fallen into several fits of hideous blues, had been 
in despair as to the future.  As soon as she saw something 
of people&mdash;always the valuable, musical sort of 
people&mdash;her spirits improved.  And when she got a 
few new dresses&mdash;very simple and inexpensive, but 
stylish and charming&mdash;and the hats, too, were successful&mdash; 
as soon as she was freshly arrayed she was singing 
better and was talking hopefully of the career 
again.  Yes, it was really necessary that she live as 
she had always been used to living. 
</p><p>When Stanley came back her account was drawn up 
to the last cent of the proportionate amount.  In fact, 
it might have been a few dollars&mdash;a hundred or so&mdash; 
overdrawn.  She was not sure.  Still, that was a small 
matter.  During the summer she would spend less, and 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0208" n="195"/>
by fall she would be far ahead again&mdash;and ready to 
buy fall clothes.  One day he said: 
</p><p>"You must be needing more money.'' 
</p><p>"No indeed,'' cried she.  "I've been living within 
the hundred a week&mdash;or nearly.  I'm afraid I'm frightfully 
extravagant, and&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"Extravagant?'' laughed he.  "You are afraid to 
borrow!  Why, three or four nights of singing will 
pay back all you've borrowed.'' 
</p><p>"I suppose I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> make a lot of money,'' 
said she. 
"They all tell me so.  But it doesn't seem real to me.'' 
She hastily added:  "I don't mean the career.  That 
seems real enough.  I can hardly wait to begin at the 
r&ocirc;les.  I mean the money part.  You see, I never earned 
any money and never really had any money of my own.'' 
</p><p>"Well, you'll have plenty of it in two or three years,'' 
said Stanley, confidently.  "And you mustn't try to 
live like girls who've been brought up to hardship.  It 
isn't necessary, and it would only unfit you for your 
work.'' 
</p><p>"I think that's true,'' said she.  "But I've enough&mdash; 
more than enough.''  She gave him a nervous, shy, 
almost agonized look.  "Please don't try to put me 
under any heavier obligations than I have to be.'' 
</p><p>"Please don't talk nonsense about obligation,'' 
retorted he.  "Let's get away from this subject.  You 
don't seem to realize that you're doing me a favor, that 
it's a privilege to be allowed to help develop such a 
marvelous voice as yours.  Scores of people would jump 
at the chance.'' 
</p><p>"That doesn't lessen my obligation,'' said she.  And 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0209" n="196"/> 
she thought she meant it, though, in fact, his generous 
and plausible statement of the case had immediately 
lessened not a little her sense of obligation. 
</p><p>On the whole, however, she was not sorry she had 
this chance to talk of obligation.  Slowly, as they saw 
each other from time to time, often alone, Stanley had 
begun&mdash;perhaps in spite of himself and unconsciously 
&mdash;to show his feeling for her.  Sometimes his hand 
accidentally touched hers, and he did not draw it away 
as quickly as he might.  And she&mdash;it was impossible 
for her to make any gesture, much less say anything, 
that suggested sensitiveness on her part.  It would put 
him in an awkward position, would humiliate him most 
unjustly.  He fell into the habit of holding her hand 
longer than was necessary at greeting or parting, of 
touching her caressingly, of looking at her with the 
eyes of a lover instead of a friend.  She did not like 
these things.  For some mysterious reason&mdash;from 
sheer perversity, she thought&mdash;she had taken a strong 
physical dislike to him.  Perfectly absurd, for there 
was nothing intrinsically repellent about this handsome, 
clean, most attractively dressed man, of the best type 
of American and New-Yorker.  No, only perversity 
could explain such a silly notion.  She was always 
afraid he would try to take advantage of her delicate 
position&mdash;always afraid she would have to yield something, 
some trifle; yet the idea of giving anything from 
a sense of obligation was galling to her.  His very 
refraining made her more nervous, the more shrinking. 
If he would only commit some overt act&mdash;seize her, 
kiss her, make outrageous demands&mdash;but this refrain-
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0210" n="197"/> 
ing, these touches that might be accidental and again 
might be stealthy approach&mdash;  She hated to have him 
shake hands with her, would have liked to draw away 
when his clothing chanced to brush against hers. 
</p><p>So she was glad of the talk about obligation.  It set 
him at a distance, immediately.  He ceased to look 
lovingly, to indulge in the nerve-rasping little caresses. 
He became carefully formal.  He was evidently eager 
to prove the sincerity of his protestations&mdash;too eager 
perhaps, her perverse mind suggested.  Still, sincere 
or not, he held to all the forms of sincerity. 
</p><p>Some friends of Mrs. Brindley's who were going 
abroad offered her their cottage on the New Jersey 
coast near Seabright, and a big new touring-car and 
chauffeur.  She and Mildred at once gave up the plan 
for a summer in the Adirondacks, the more readily as 
several of the men and women they saw the most of 
lived within easy distance of them at Deal Beach and 
Elberon.  When Mildred went shopping she was lured 
into buying a lot of summer things she would not have 
needed in the Adirondacks&mdash;a mere matter of two 
hundred and fifty dollars or thereabouts.  A little 
additional economy in the fall would soon make up for such 
a trifle, and if there is one time more than another when 
a woman wishes to look well and must look well, that 
time is summer&mdash;especially by the sea. 
</p><p>When her monthly statement from the bank came on 
the first of July she found that five thousand dollars 
had been deposited to her credit.  She was moved by 
this discovery to devote several hours&mdash;very depressed 
hours they were&mdash;to her finances.  She had spent a 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0211" n="198"/> 
great deal more money than she had thought; indeed, 
since March she had been living at the rate of fifteen 
thousand a year.  She tried to account for this amazing 
extravagance.  But she could recall no expenditure 
that was not really almost, if not quite, necessary.  It 
took a frightful lot of money to live in New York. 
How <hi rend="italic">did</hi> people with small incomes manage to get 
along? 
Whatever would have become of her if she had not had 
the good luck to be able to borrow from Stanley?  What 
would become of her if, before she was succeeding on 
the stage, Stanley should die or lose faith in her or 
interest in her?  What would become of her!  She had 
been living these last few months among people who 
had wide-open eyes and knew everything that was going 
on&mdash;and did some "going-on'' themselves, as she was 
now more than suspecting.  There were many women, 
thousands of them&mdash;among the attractive, costily 
dressed throngs she saw in the carriages and autos and 
cabs&mdash;who would not like to have it published how they 
contrived to live so luxuriously.  No, they would not 
like to have it published, though they cared not a fig 
for its being whispered; New York too thoroughly 
understood how necessary luxurious living was, and was 
too completely divested of the follies of the old-fashioned, 
straight-laced morality, to mind little shabby 
details of queer conduct in striving to keep up with 
the procession.  Even the married women, using their 
husbands&mdash;and letting their husbands use them&mdash;did 
not frown on the irregularities of their sisters less 
fortunately married or not able to find a permanent "leg 
to pull.''  As for the girls&mdash;Mildred had observed 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0212" n="199"/> 
strange things in the lives of the girls she knew more 
or less well nowadays.  In fact, all the women, of all 
classes and conditions, were engaged in the same mad 
struggle to get hold of money to spend upon fun and 
finery&mdash;a struggle matching in recklessness and 
resoluteness the struggle of the men down-town for money 
for the same purposes.  It was curious, this double 
mania of the men and the women&mdash;the mania to get 
money, no matter how; the instantly succeeding mania 
to get rid of it, no matter how.  Looking about her, 
Mildred felt that she was peculiar and apart from nearly 
all the women she knew.  <hi rend="italic">She</hi> got her money 
honorably. 
<hi rend="italic">She</hi> did not degrade herself, did not sell herself, 
did not 
wheedle or cajole or pretend in the least degree.  She 
had grown more liberal as her outlook on life had 
widened with contact with the New York mind&mdash;no, 
with the mind of the whole easy-going, luxury-mad, 
morality-scorning modern world.  She still kept her 
standard for herself high, and believed in a purity for 
herself which she did not exact or expect in her friends. 
In this respect she and Cyrilla Brindley were sympathetically 
alike.  No, Mildred was confident that in no 
circumstances, in <hi rend="italic">no</hi> circumstances, would she relax 
her 
ideas of what she personally could do and could not do. 
Not that she blamed, or judged at all, women who did 
as she would not; but she could not, simply could not, 
however hard she might be driven, do those things&mdash; 
though she could easily understand how other women 
did them in preference to sinking down into the working 
class or eking out a frowsy existence in some poor 
boarding-house.  The temptation would be great. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0213" n="200"/> 
Thank Heaven, it was not teasing her.  She would 
resist it, of course.  But&mdash; 
</p><p>What if Stanley Baird should lose interest?  What 
if, after he lost interest, she should find herself without 
money, worse of than she had been when she sold 
herself into slavery&mdash;highly moral and conventionally 
correct slavery, but still slavery&mdash;to the little general 
with the peaked pink-silk nightcap hiding the absence 
of the removed toupee&mdash;and with the wonderful 
pink-silk pajamas, gorgeously monogramed in violet&mdash; 
and the tiny feet and ugly hands&mdash;and those loathsome 
needle-pointed mustaches and the hideous habit of 
mumbling his tongue and smacking his lips?  What 
if, moneyless, she should not be able to find another 
Stanley or a man of the class gentleman willing to 
help her generously even on <hi rend="italic">any</hi> terms?  What 
then? 
</p><p>She was looking out over the sea, her bank-book and 
statements and canceled checks in her lap.  Their cottage 
was at the very edge of the strand; its veranda 
was often damp from spray after a storm.  It was not 
storming as she sat there, "taking stock''; under a 
blue sky an almost tranquil sea was crooning softly in 
the sunlight, innocent and happy and playful as a child. 
She, dressed in a charming neglig&eacute;e and looking forward 
to a merry day in the auto, with lunch and dinner 
at attractive, luxurious places farther down the coast&mdash; 
she was stricken with a horrible sadness, with a terror 
that made her heart beat wildly. 
</p><p>"I must be crazy!'' she said, half aloud.  "I've 
never earned a dollar with my voice.  And for two 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0214" n="201"/> 
months it has been unreliable.  I'm acting like a crazy 
person.  What <hi rend="italic">will</hi> become of me?'' 
</p><p>Just then Stanley Baird came through the pretty little 
house, seeking her.  "There you are!'' he cried.  "Do 
go get dressed.'' 
</p><p>Hastily she flung a scarf over the book and papers 
in her lap.  She had intended to speak to him about 
that fresh deposit of five thousand dollars&mdash;to refuse 
it, to rebuke him.  Now she did not dare. 
</p><p>"What's the matter?'' he went on.  "Headache?'' 
</p><p>"It was the wine at dinner last night,'' explained she. 
"I ought never to touch red wine.  It disagrees with 
me horribly.'' 
</p><p>"That was filthy stuff,'' said he.  "You must take 
some champagne at lunch.  That'll set you right.'' 
</p><p>She stealthily wound the scarf about the papers. 
When she felt that all were secure she rose.  She was 
looking sweet and sad and peculiarly beautiful.  There 
was an exquisite sheen on her skin.  She had washed 
her hair that morning, and it was straying fascinatingly 
about her brow and ears and neck.  Baird looked at 
her, lowered his eyes and colored. 
</p><p>"I'll not be long,'' she said hurriedly. 
</p><p>She had to pass him in the rather narrow doorway. 
From her garments shook a delicious perfume.  He 
caught her in his arms.  The blood had flushed into his 
face in a torrent, swelling out the veins, giving him 
a distorted and wild expression. 
</p><p>"Mildred!'' he cried.  "Say that you love me a 
little!  I'm so lonely for you&mdash;so hungry for you!'' 
</p><p>She grew cold with fear and with repulsion.  She 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0215" n="202"/> 
neither yielded to his embrace nor shook it off.  She 
simply stood, her round smooth body hard though corsetless. 
He kissed her on the throat, kissed the lace over 
her bosom, crying out inarticulately.  In the frenzy of 
his passion he did not for a while realize her lack of 
response.  As he felt it, his arms relaxed, dropped away 
from her, fell at his side.  He hung his head.  He was 
breathing so heavily that she glanced into the house 
apprehensively, fearing someone else might hear. 
</p><p>"I beg pardon,'' he muttered.  "You were too much 
for me this morning.  It was your fault.  You are 
maddening!'' 
</p><p>She moved on into the house. 
</p><p>"Wait a minute!'' he called after her. 
</p><p>She halted, hesitating. 
</p><p>"Come back,'' he said.  "I've got something to say 
to you.'' 
</p><p>She turned and went back to the veranda, he retreating 
before her and his eyes sinking before the cold, 
clear blue of hers. 
</p><p>"You're going up, not to come down again,'' he said. 
"You think I've insulted you&mdash;think I've acted outrageously.'' 
</p><p>How glad she was that he had so misread her thoughts 
&mdash;had not discovered the fear, the weakness, the sudden 
collapse of all her boasted confidence in her strength of 
character. 
</p><p>"You'll never feel the same toward me again,'' he 
went fatuously on.  "You think I'm a fraud.  Well, 
I'll admit that I am in love with you&mdash;have been ever 
since the steamer&mdash;always was crazy about that mouth 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0216" n="203"/> 
of yours&mdash;and your figure, and the sound of your 
voice.  I'll admit I'm an utter fool about you&mdash;respect 
you and trust you as I never used to think any woman 
deserved to be respected and trusted.  I'll even admit 
that I've been hoping&mdash;all sorts of things.  I knew 
a woman like you wouldn't let a man help her unless 
she loved him.'' 
</p><p>At this her heart beat wildly and a blush of shame 
poured over her face and neck.  He did not see.  He 
had not the courage to look at her&mdash;to face that 
expression of the violated goddess he felt confident her 
face was wearing.  In love, he reasoned and felt about 
her like an inexperienced boy, all his experience going 
for nothing.  He went on: 
</p><p>"I understand we can never be anything to each other 
until you're on the stage and arrived.  I'd not have it 
otherwise, if I could.  For I want <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, and I'd 
never 
believe I had you unless you were free.'' 
</p><p>The color was fading from her cheeks.  At this it 
flushed deeper than before.  She must speak.  Not to 
speak was to lie, was to play the hypocrite.  Yet speak 
she dared not.  At least Stanley Baird was better than 
Siddall.  Anyhow, who was she, that had been the wife 
of Siddall, to be so finicky? 
</p><p>"You don't believe me?'' he said miserably.  "You 
think I'll forget myself sometime again?'' 
</p><p>"I hope not,'' she said gently.  "I believe not.  I 
trust you, Stanley.'' 
</p><p>And she went into the house.  He looked after her, 
in admiration of the sweet and pure calm of this quiet 
rebuke.  She tried to take the same exalted view of it 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0217" n="204"/>  
herself, but she could not fool herself just then with 
the familiar "good woman'' fake.  She knew that she 
had struck the flag of self-respect.  She knew what she 
would really have done had he been less delicate, less 
in love, and more "practical.''  And she found a small 
and poor consolation in reflecting, "I wonder how many 
women there are who take high ground because it costs 
nothing.''  We are prone to suspect everybody of any 
weakness we find in ourselves&mdash;and perhaps we are not 
so far wrong as are those who accept without question 
the noisy protestations of a world of self-deceivers. 
</p><p>Thenceforth she and Stanley got on better than ever 
&mdash;apparently.  But though she ignored it, she knew 
the truth&mdash;knew her new and deep content was due to 
her not having challenged his assertion that she loved 
him.  He, believing her honest and high minded, 
assumed that the failure to challenge was a good 
woman's way of admitting.  But with the day of reckoning&mdash; 
not only with him but also with her own self-respect&mdash;put off until that vague and remote time when 
she should be a successful prima donna, she gave herself 
up to enjoyment.  That was a summer of rarely fine 
weather, particularly fine along the Jersey coast.  They 
&mdash;always in gay parties&mdash;motored up and down the 
coast and inland.  Several of the "musical'' men&mdash; 
notably Richardson of Elberon&mdash;had plenty of money; 
Stanley, stopping with his cousins, the Frasers, on the 
Rumson Road, brought several of his friends, all rich 
and more or less free.  As every moment of Mildred's 
day was full and as it was impossible not to sleep and 
sleep well in that ocean air, with the surf soothing the 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0218" n="205"/>  
nerves as the lullaby of a nurse soothes a baby, she was 
able to put everything unpleasant out of mind.  She 
was resting her voice, was building up her health; 
therefore the career was being steadily advanced and no 
time was being wasted.  She felt sorry for those who 
had to do unpleasant or disagreeable things in making 
their careers.  She told herself that she did not deserve 
her good fortune in being able to advance to a brilliant 
career not through hardship but over the most delightful 
road imaginable&mdash;amusing herself, wearing charming 
and satisfactory clothes, swimming and dancing, 
motoring and feasting.  Without realizing it, she was 
strongly under the delusion that she was herself already 
rich&mdash;the inevitable delusion with a woman when she 
moves easily and freely and luxuriously about, never 
bothered for money, always in the company of rich 
people.  The rich are fated to demoralize those around 
them.  The stingy rich fill their satellites with envy and 
hatred.  The generous rich fill them with the feeling 
that the light by which they shine and the heat with 
which they are warm are not reflected light and heat 
but their own. 
</p><p>Never had she been so happy.  She even did not 
especially mind Donald Keith, a friend of Stanley's and of 
Mrs. Brindley's, who, much too often to suit her, made 
one of the party.  She had tried in vain to discover 
what there was in Keith that inspired such intense liking 
in two people so widely different as expansive and 
emotional Stanley Baird and reserved and distinctly cold 
Cyrilla Brindley.  Keith talked little, not only seemed 
not to listen well, but showed plainly, even in t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0219" n="206"/>  
conversations, that his thoughts had been elsewhere. 
He made no pretense of being other than he was&mdash;an 
indifferent man who came because it did not especially 
matter to him where he was.  Sometimes his silence and 
his indifference annoyed Mildred; again&mdash;thanks to 
her profound and reckless contentment&mdash;she was able 
to forget that he was along.  He seemed to be and probably 
was about forty years old.  His head was beautifully 
shaped, the line of its profile&mdash;front, top, and 
back&mdash;being perfect in intellectuality, strength and 
symmetry.  He was rather under the medium height, 
about the same height as Mildred herself.  He was 
extremely thin and loosely built, and his clothes seemed 
to hang awry, giving him an air of slovenliness which 
became surprising when one noted how scrupulously 
neat and clean he was.  His brown hair, considerably 
tinged with rusty gray, grew thinly upon that beautiful 
head.  His skin was dry and smooth and dead white. 
This, taken with the classic regularity of his features, 
gave him an air of lifelessness, of one burnt out by the 
fire of too much living; but whether the living had been 
done by Keith himself or by his immediate ancestors 
appearances did not disclose.  This look of passionless, 
motionless repose, like classic sculpture, was sharply and 
startlingly belied by a pair of really wonderful eyes&mdash; 
deeply and intensely blue, brilliant, all seeing, all 
comprehending, eyes that seemed never to sleep, seemed the 
ceaselessly industrious servants of a brain that busied 
itself without pause.  The contrast between the dead 
white calm of his face, the listlessness of his relaxed 
figure, and these vivid eyes, so intensely alive, gave to 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0220" n="207"/>
Donald Keith's personality an uncanniness that was 
most disagreeable to Mildred. 
</p><p>"That's what fascinates me,'' said Cyrilla, when they 
were discussing him one day. 
</p><p>"Fascinates!'' exclaimed Mildred.  "He's tiresome&mdash; 
when he isn't rude.'' 
</p><p>"Rude?'' 
</p><p>"Not actively rude but, worse still, passively rude.'' 
</p><p>"He is the only man I've ever seen with whom I could 
imagine myself falling in love,'' said Mrs. Brindley. 
</p><p>Mildred laughed in derision.  "Why, he's a dead 
man!'' cried she. 
</p><p>"You don't understand,'' said Cyrilla.  "You've 
never lived with a man.''  She forgot completely, as did 
Mildred herself, so completely had Mrs. Siddall returned 
to the modes and thoughts of a girl.  "At home&mdash;to 
live with&mdash;you want only reposeful things.  That is 
why the Greeks, whose instincts were unerring, had so 
much reposeful statuary.  One grows weary of agitating 
objects.  They soon seem hysterical and shallow. 
The same thing's true of persons.  For permanent 
love and friendship you want reposeful men&mdash; 
calm, strong, silent.  The other kind either wear you 
out or wear themselves out with you.'' 
</p><p>"You forget his eyes,'' put in Stanley.  "Did you 
ever see such eyes!'' 
</p><p>"Yes, those eyes of his!'' cried Mildred.  "You 
certainly can't call them reposeful, Mrs. Brindley.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley did not seize the opportunity to convict 
her of inconsistency.  Said she: 
</p><p>"I admit the eyes.  They're the eyes of the kind of 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0221" n="208"/> 
man a woman wants, or another man wants in his friend. 
When Keith looks at you, you feel that you are seeing 
the rarest being in the world&mdash;an absolutely reliable 
person.  When I think of him I think of reliable, just 
as when you think of the sun you think of brightness.'' 
</p><p>"I had no idea it was so serious as this,'' teased 
Stanley. 
</p><p>"Nor had I,'' returned Cyrilla easily, "until I began 
to talk about him.  Don't tell him, Mr. Baird, or he 
might take advantage of me.'' 
</p><p>The idea amused Stanley.  "He doesn't care a rap 
about women,'' said he.  "I hear he has let a few care 
about him from time to time, but he soon ceased to 
be good-natured.  He hates to be bored.'' 
</p><p>As he came just then, they had to find another 
subject.  Mildred observed him with more interest.  She 
had learned to have respect for Mrs. Brindley's 
judgments.  But she soon gave over watching him.  That 
profound calm, those eyes concentrating all the life of 
the man like a burning glass&mdash;  She had a disagreeable 
sense of being seen through, even to her secretest 
thought, of being understood and measured and weighed 
&mdash;and found wanting.  It occurred to her for the first 
time that part of the reason for her not liking him 
was the best of reasons&mdash;that he did not like her. 
</p><p>The first time she was left alone with him, after this 
discovery, she happened to be in an audacious and 
talkative mood, and his lack of response finally goaded 
her into saying:  "<hi rend="italic">Why</hi> don't you like me?''  She 
cared 
nothing about it; she simply wished to hear what he 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0222" n="209"/> 
would say&mdash;if he could be roused into saying anything. 
He was sitting on the steps leading from the 
veranda to the sea&mdash;was smoking a cigarette and gazing 
out over the waves like a graven image, as if he 
had always been posed there and always would be there, 
the embodiment of repose gazing in ineffable indifference 
upon the embodiment of its opposite.  He made 
no answer. 
</p><p>"I asked you why you do not like me,'' said she. 
"Did you hear?'' 
</p><p>"Yes,'' replied he. 
</p><p>She waited; nothing further from him.  Said she: 
</p><p>"Well, give me one of your cigarettes.'' 
</p><p>He rose, extended his case, then a light.  He was 
never remiss in those kinds of politeness.  When she 
was smoking, he seated himself again and dropped into 
the former attitude.  She eyed him, wondering how it 
could be possible that he had endured the incredible 
fatigues and hardships Stanley Baird had related of 
him&mdash;hunting and exploring expeditions into tropics 
and into frozen regions, mountain climbs, wild sea 
voyages in small boats, all with no sign of being able to 
stand anything, yet also with no sign of being any 
more disturbed than now in this seaside laziness.  Stanley 
had showed them a picture of him taken twenty years 
and more ago when he was in college; he had looked 
almost the same then&mdash;perhaps a little older. 
</p><p>"Well, I am waiting,'' persisted she. 
</p><p>She thought he was about to look at her&mdash;a thing 
he had never done, to her knowledge, since they had 
known each other.  She nerved herself to receive the 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0223" n="210"/> 
shock, with a certain flutter of expectancy, of excitement 
even.  But instead of looking, he settled himself 
in a slightly different position and fixed his gaze upon 
another point in the horizon.  She noted that he had 
splendid hands&mdash;ideal hands for a man, with the same 
suggestion of intense vitality and aliveness that flashed 
from his eyes.  She had not noted this before.  Next 
she saw that he had good feet, and that his boots were 
his only article of apparel that fitted him, or rather, 
that looked as if made for him. 
</p><p>She tossed her cigarette over the rail to the sand. 
He startled her by speaking, in his unemotional way. 
He said: 
</p><p>"Now, I like you better.'' 
</p><p>"I don't understand,'' said she. 
</p><p>No answer from him.  The cigarette depending 
listlessly from his lips seemed&mdash;as usual&mdash;uncertain 
whether it would stay or fall.  She watched this uncertainty 
with a curious, nervous interest.  She was always 
thinking that cigarette would fall, but it never did. 
Said she: 
</p><p>"Why did you say you liked me less?'' 
</p><p>"Better,'' corrected he. 
</p><p>"We used to have a pump in our back yard at home,'' 
laughed she.  "One toiled away at the handle, but 
nothing ever came.  And it was a promising-looking 
pump, too.'' 
</p><p>He smiled&mdash;a slow, reluctant smile, but undeniably 
attractive.  Said he: 
</p><p>"Because you threw away your cigarette.'' 
</p><p>"You object to women smoking?'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0224" n="211"/> 
</p><p>"No,'' said he.  His tone made her feel how absurd 
it was to suspect him of such provincialism. 
</p><p>"You object to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> smoking?'' suggested she; 
laughing, "Pump!  Pump!'' 
</p><p>"No,'' said he. 
</p><p>"Then your remark meant nothing at all?'' 
</p><p>He was silent. 
</p><p>"You are rude,'' said she coldly, rising to go into 
the house. 
</p><p>He said something, what she did not hear, in her 
agitation.  She paused and inquired: 
</p><p>"What did you say?'' 
</p><p>"I said, I am not rude but kind,'' replied he. 
</p><p>"That is detestable!'' cried she.  "I have not liked 
you, but I have been polite to you because of Stanley 
and Mrs. Brindley.  Why should you be insulting to 
me?'' 
</p><p>"What have I done?'' inquired he, unmoved.  He 
had risen as she rose, but instead of facing her he was 
leaning against the post of the veranda, bent upon his 
seaward vigil. 
</p><p>"You have insinuated that your reasons for not liking 
me were a reflection on me.'' 
</p><p>"You insisted,'' said he. 
</p><p>"You mean that they are?'' demanded she furiously. 
She was amazed at her wild, unaccountable rage. 
</p><p>He slowly turned his head and looked at her&mdash;a 
glance without any emotion whatever, simply a look 
that, like the beam of a powerful searchlight, seemed 
to thrust through fog and darkness and to light up 
everything in its path.  Said he: 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0225" n="212"/> 
</p><p>"Do you wish me to tell you why I don't like you?'' 
</p><p>"No!'' she cried hysterically.  "Never mind&mdash;I 
don't know what I'm saying.''  And she went hastily 
into the house.  A moment later, in her own room 
upstairs, she was wondering at herself.  Why had she 
become confused?  What did he mean?  What had she 
seen&mdash;or half seen&mdash;in the darkness and fog within 
herself when he looked at her?  In a passion she cried: 
</p><p>"If he would only stay away!'' </p>
 
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="6" id="d11"> 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0226" n="213"/> 
<head>VI </head>
<p>BUT he did not stay away.  He owned and lived in 
a small house up on the Rumson Road.  While the 
house was little more than a bungalow and had a 
simplicity that completely hid its rare good taste from the 
average observer, its grounds were the most spacious in 
that neighborhood of costly, showy houses set in grounds 
not much more extensive than a city building lot.  The 
grounds had been cleared and drained to drive out and 
to keep out the obnoxious insect life, but had been left 
a forest, concealing the house from the roads.  Stanley 
Baird was now stopping with Keith, and brought him 
along to the cottage by the sea every day. 
</p><p>The parties narrowed to the same four persons.  Mrs. 
Brindley seemed never to tire of talking to Keith&mdash; 
or to tire of talking about him when the two men had 
left, late each night.  As for Stanley, he referred 
everything to Keith&mdash;the weather prospects, where they 
should go for the day, what should be eaten and drunk, 
any point about politics or fashion, life or literature 
or what not, that happened to be discussed.  And he 
looked upon Donald's monosyllabic reply to his inquiry 
as a final judgment, ending all possibility of argument. 
Mildred held out long.  Then, in spite of herself, she 
began to yield, ceased to dislike him, found a kind of 
pleasure&mdash;or, perhaps, fascinated interest&mdash;in the 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0227" n="214"/> 
nervousness his silent and indifferent presence caused 
her.  She liked to watch that immobile, perfect profile, 
neither young nor old, indeed not suggesting age in 
any degree, but only experience and knowledge&mdash;and 
an infinite capacity for emotion, for passion even.  The 
dead-white color declared it had already been lived; 
the brilliant, usually averted or veiled eyes asserted 
present vitality, pulsing under a calm surface. 
</p><p>One day when Stanley, in the manner of one who 
wishes a thing settled and settled right, said he would 
ask Donald Keith about it, Mildred, a little piqued, 
a little amused, retorted: 
</p><p>"And what will he answer?  Why, simply yes or no.'' 
</p><p>"That's all,'' assented Stanley.  "And that's quite 
enough, isn't it?'' 
</p><p>"But how do you know he's as wise as he pretends?'' 
</p><p>"He doesn't pretend to be anything or to know 
anything.  That's precisely it.'' 
</p><p>Mildred suddenly began to like Keith.  She had never 
thought of this before.  Yes, it was true, he did not 
pretend.  Not in the least, not about anything.  When 
you saw him, you saw at once the worst there was to 
see.  It was afterward that you discovered he was not 
slovenly, but clean and neat, not badly but well dressed, 
not homely but handsome, not sickly but soundly well, 
not physically weak but strong, not dull but vividly alive, 
not a tiresome void but an unfathomable mystery. 
</p><p>"What does he do?'' she asked Mrs. Brindley. 
</p><p>Cyrilla's usually positive gray eyes looked vague. 
She smiled.  "I never asked,'' said she.  "I've known 
him nearly three years, and it never occurred to me 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0228" n="215"/> 
to ask, or to wonder.  Isn't that strange?  Usually 
about the first inquiry we make is what a man does.'' 
</p><p>"I'll ask Stanley,'' said Mildred.  And she did about 
an hour later, when they were in the surf together, with 
the other two out of earshot.  Said Stanley: 
</p><p>"He's a lawyer, of course.  Also, he's written a novel 
or two and a book of poems.  I've never read them. 
Somehow, I never get around to reading.'' 
</p><p>"Oh, he's a lawyer?  That's the way he makes his 
living.'' 
</p><p>"A queer kind of lawyer.  He never goes to court, 
and his clients are almost all other lawyers.  They go to 
him to get him to tell them what to do, and what not 
to do.  He's got a big reputation among lawyers, 
Fred Norman tells me, but makes comparatively little, 
as he either can't or won't charge what he ought.  I 
told him what Norman said, and he only smiled in that 
queer way he has.  I said:  `You make twenty or 
thirty thousand a year.  You ought to make ten 
times that.' '' 
</p><p>"And what did he answer?'' asked Mildred.  "Nothing?'' 
</p><p>"He said:  `I make all I want.  If I took in more, I'd 
be bothered getting rid of it or investing it.  I can 
always make all I'll want&mdash;unless I go crazy.  And 
what could a crazy man do with money?  It doesn't cost 
anything to live in a lunatic asylum.' '' 
</p><p>Several items of interest to add to those she had 
collected.  He could talk brilliantly, but he preferred 
silence.  He could make himself attractive to women 
and to men, but he preferred to be detached.  He could 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0229" n="216"/> 
be a great lawyer, but he preferred the quiet of obscurity. 
He could be a rich man, but he preferred to be 
comparatively poor. 
</p><p>Said Mildred:  "I suppose some woman&mdash;some 
disappointment in love&mdash;has killed ambition, and 
everything like that.'' 
</p><p>"I don't think so,'' replied Baird.  "The men who 
knew him as a boy say he was always as he is now.  He 
lived in the Arabian desert for two years.'' 
</p><p>"Why didn't he stay?'' laughed Mildred.  "That 
life would exactly suit him.'' 
</p><p>"It did,'' said Stanley.  "But his father died, and 
he had to come home and support his mother&mdash;until 
she died.  That's the way his whole life has been. 
He drifts in the current of circumstances.  He might 
let himself be blown away to-morrow to the other end 
of the earth and stay away years&mdash;or never come 
back.'' 
</p><p>"But how would he live?'' 
</p><p>"On his wits.  And as well or as poorly as he cared. 
He's the sort of man everyone instinctively asks advice 
of&mdash;me, you, his valet, the farmer who meets him at 
a boundary fence, the fellow who sits nest him in a 
train&mdash;anyone.'' 
</p><p>Mildred did not merely cease to dislike him; she went 
farther, and rapidly.  She began to like him, to circle 
round that tantalizing, indolent mystery as a deer about 
a queer bit of brush in the undergrowth.  She liked 
to watch him.  She was alternately afraid to talk before 
him and recklessly confidential&mdash;all with no response 
or sign of interest from him.  If she was silent, when 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0230" n="217"/> 
they were alone together, he was silent, too.  If she 
talked, still he was silent.  What <hi rend="italic">was</hi> he thinking 
about? 
What did he think of her?&mdash;that especially. 
</p><p>"What <hi rend="italic">are</hi> you thinking?'' she interrupted 
herself 
to say one afternoon as they sat together on the strand 
under a big sunshade.  She had been talking on and on 
about her career&mdash;talking conceitedly, as her subject 
intoxicated her&mdash;telling him what triumphs awaited 
her as soon as she should be ready to d&eacute;but.  As he 
did not answer, she repeated her question, adding: 
</p><p>"I knew you weren't listening to me, or I shouldn't 
have had the courage to say the foolish things I did.'' 
</p><p>"No, I wasn't,'' admitted he. 
</p><p>"Why not?'' 
</p><p>"For the reason you gave.'' 
</p><p>"That what I said was&mdash;just talk?'' 
</p><p>"Yes.'' 
</p><p>"You don't believe I'll do those things?'' 
</p><p>"Do you?'' 
</p><p>"I've <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to believe it,'' said she.  "If 
I didn't&mdash;'' 
She came to a full stop. 
</p><p>"If you didn't, then what?''  It was the first time 
he had ever flattered her with interest enough to ask 
her a question about herself. 
</p><p>"If I didn't believe I was going to succeed&mdash;and 
succeed big&mdash;'' she began.  After a pause, she added, 
"I'd not dare say it.'' 
</p><p>"Or think it,'' said he. 
</p><p>She colored.  "What do you mean?'' she asked. 
</p><p>He did not reply. 
</p><p>"What do you mean, Mr. Keith?'' she urged. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0231" n="218"/>
</p><p>"You are always asking me questions to which you 
already know the answer,'' said he. 
</p><p>"You're referring to a week or so ago, when I asked 
you why you disliked me?'' 
</p><p>No answer.  No sign of having heard.  No outward 
sign of interest in anything, even in the cigarette drooping 
from the corner of his mouth. 
</p><p>"Wasn't that it?'' she insisted. 
</p><p>"You are always asking me questions to which you 
already know the answer,'' repeated he. 
</p><p>"I am annoying you?'' 
</p><p>No answer. 
</p><p>She laughed.  "Do you want me to go away and 
leave you in peace with that&mdash;law case&mdash;or whatever 
it is?'' 
</p><p>"I don't like to be alone.'' 
</p><p>"But anyone would do?&mdash;a dog?'' 
</p><p>No reply. 
</p><p>"You mean, a dog would be better because it doesn't 
ask questions to which it knows the answer.'' 
</p><p>No reply. 
</p><p>"Well, I have a pleasant-sounding voice.  As I'm 
saying nothing, it may be soothing&mdash;like the sound of 
the waves.  I've learned to take you as you are.  I 
rather like your pose.'' 
</p><p>No reply.  No sign that he was even tempted to rise 
to this bait and protest. 
</p><p>"But you don't like mine,'' she went on.  "Yes, it 
is a pose.  But I've got to keep it up, and to pretend 
to myself that it isn't.  And it isn't altogether.  I shall 
be a successful singer.'' 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0232" n="219"/> 
</p><p>"When?'' said he.  Actually he was listening! 
</p><p>She answered:  "In&mdash;about two years, I think.'' 
</p><p>No comment. 
</p><p>"You don't believe it?'' 
</p><p>"Do you?''  A pause.  "Why ask these questions 
you've already answered yourself?'' 
</p><p>"I'll tell you why,'' replied she, her face suddenly 
flushed with earnestness.  "Because I want you to help 
me.  You help everyone else.  Why not me?'' 
</p><p>"You never asked me,'' said he. 
</p><p>"I didn't know I wanted it until just now&mdash;as I 
said it.  But <hi rend="italic">you</hi> must have known, because you are 
so much more experienced than I&mdash;and understand 
people&mdash;what's going on in their minds, deeper than 
they can see.''  Her tone became indignant, reproachful. 
"Yes, you must have known I needed your help. 
And you ought to have helped me, even if you did 
dislike me.  You've no right to dislike anyone as young 
as I.'' 
</p><p>He was looking at her now, the intensely alive blue 
eyes sympathetic, penetrating, understanding.  It was 
frightful to be so thoroughly understood&mdash;all one's 
weaknesses laid bare&mdash;yet it was a relief and a joy, too 
&mdash;like the cruel healing knife of the surgeon.  Said he: 
</p><p>"I do not like kept women.'' 
</p><p>She gasped, grew ghastly.  It was a frightful insult, 
one for which she was wholly unprepared.  "You&mdash; 
believe&mdash;that?'' she said slowly. 
</p><p>"Another of those questions,'' he said.  And he 
looked calmly away, out over the sea, as if his interest 
in the conversation were at an end. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0233" n="220"/>  
</p><p>What should she say?  How deny&mdash;how convince 
him?  For convince him she must, and then go away 
and never permit him to speak to her again until he had 
apologized.  She said quietly:  "Mr. Keith, you have 
insulted me.'' 
</p><p>"I do not like kept women, either with or without 
a license,'' said he in the same even, indifferent way. 
"When you ceased to be a kept woman, I would help 
you, if I could.  But no one can help a kept woman.'' 
</p><p>There was nothing to do but to rise and go away. 
She rose and went toward the house.  At the veranda 
she paused.  He had not moved.  She returned.  He 
was still inspecting the horizon, the cigarette depending 
from his lips&mdash;how <hi rend="italic">did</hi> he keep it alight?  She 
said: 
</p><p>"Mr. Keith, I am sure you did not mean to insult 
me.  What did you mean?'' 
</p><p>"Another of those questions,'' said he. 
</p><p>"Honestly, I do not understand.'' 
</p><p>"Then think.  And when you have thought, you 
will understand.'' 
</p><p>"But I have thought.  I do not understand.'' 
</p><p>"Then it would be useless to explain,'' said he. 
"That is one of those vital things which, if one cannot 
understand them for oneself, one is hopeless&mdash;is beyond 
helping.'' 
</p><p>"You mean I am not in earnest about my career?'' 
</p><p>"Another of those questions.  If you had not seen 
clearly what I meant, you would have been really 
offended.  You'd have gone away and not come 
back.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0234" n="221"/>
</p><p>She saw that this was true.  And, seeing, she 
wondered how she could have been so stupid as not to have 
seen it at once.  She had yet to learn that overlooking 
the obvious is a universal human failing and that seeing 
the obvious is the talent and the use of the superior 
of earth&mdash;the few who dominate and determine the 
race. 
</p><p>"You reproach me for not having helped you,'' he 
went on.  "How does it happen that you are uneasy 
in mind&mdash;so uneasy that you are quarreling at me?'' 
</p><p>A light broke upon her.  "You have been drawing 
me on, from the beginning,'' she cried.  "You have 
been helping me&mdash;making me see that I needed 
help.'' 
</p><p>"No,'' said he.  "I've been waiting to see whether 
you would rouse from your dream of grandeur.'' 
</p><p>"<hi rend="italic">You</hi> have been rousing me.'' 
</p><p>"No,'' he said.  "You've roused yourself.  So you 
may be worth helping or, rather, worth encouraging, 
for no one can <hi rend="italic">help</hi> you but yourself.'' 
</p><p>She looked at him pathetically.  "But what shall I 
do?'' she asked.  "I've got no money, no experience, 
no sense.  I'm a vain, luxury-loving fool, cursed with 
a&mdash;with a&mdash;is it a conscience?'' 
</p><p>"I hope it's something more substantial.  I hope 
it's common sense.'' 
</p><p>"But I have been working&mdash;honestly I have.'' 
</p><p>"Don't begin lying to yourself again.'' 
</p><p>"Don't be harsh with me.'' 
</p><p>He drew in his legs, in preparation for rising&mdash;no 
doubt to go away. 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0235" n="222"/> 
</p><p>"I don't mean that,'' she cried testily.  "You are 
not harsh with me.  It's the truth that's harsh&mdash;the 
truth I'm beginning to see&mdash;and feel.  I am afraid&mdash; 
afraid.  I haven't the courage to face it.'' 
</p><p>"Why whine?'' said he.  "There's nothing in that.'' 
</p><p>"Do you think there's any hope for me?'' 
</p><p>"That depends,'' said he. 
</p><p>"On what?'' 
</p><p>"On what you want.'' 
</p><p>"I want to be a singer, a great singer.'' 
</p><p>"No, there's no hope.'' 
</p><p>She grew cold with despair.  He had a way of saying 
a thing that gave it the full weight of a verdict 
from which there was no appeal. 
</p><p>"Now, if you wanted to make a living,'' he went on, 
"and if you were determined to learn to sing as well 
as you could, with the idea that you might be able to 
make a living&mdash;why, then there might be hope.'' 
</p><p>"You think I can sing?'' 
</p><p>"I never heard you.  Can you?'' 
</p><p>"They say I can.'' 
</p><p>"What do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> say?'' 
</p><p>"I don't know,'' she confessed.  "I've never been 
able to judge.  Sometimes I think I'm singing well, and 
I find out afterward that I've sung badly.  Again, it's 
the other way.'' 
</p><p>"Then, obviously, what's the first thing to do?'' 
</p><p>"To learn to judge myself,'' said she.  "I never 
thought of it before&mdash;how important that is.  Do you 
know Jennings&mdash;Eugene Jennings?'' 
</p><p>"The singing teacher?  No.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0236" n="223"/> 
</p><p>"Is he a good teacher?'' 
</p><p>"No.'' 
</p><p>"Why not?'' 
</p><p>"Because he has not taught you that you will never 
sing until you are your own teacher.  Because he has 
not taught you that singing is a small and minor part 
of a career as a singer.'' 
</p><p>"But it isn't,'' protested she. 
</p><p>A long silence.  Looking at him, she felt that he had 
dismissed her and her affairs from his mind. 
</p><p>"Is it?'' she said, to bring him back. 
</p><p>"What?'' asked he vaguely. 
</p><p>"You said that a singer didn't have to be able to 
sing.'' 
</p><p>"Did I?''  He glanced down the shore toward the 
house.  "It feels like lunch-time.''  He rose. 
</p><p>"What did you mean by what you said?'' 
</p><p>"When you have thought about your case a while 
longer, we'll talk of it again&mdash;if you wish.  But until 
you've thought, talking is a waste of time.'' 
</p><p>She rose, stood staring out to sea.  He was observing 
her, a faint smile about his lips.  He said: 
</p><p>"Why bother about a career?  After all, kept 
woman is a thoroughly respectable occupation&mdash;or can 
be made so by any preacher or justice of the peace. 
It's followed by many of our best women&mdash;those who 
pride themselves on their high characters&mdash;and on 
their pride.'' 
</p><p>"I could not belong to a man unless I cared for him,'' 
said she.  "I tried it once.  I shall never do it again.'' 
</p><p>"That sounds fine,'' said he.  "Let's go to lunch.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0237" n="224"/> 
</p><p>"You don't believe me?'' 
</p><p>"Do you?'' 
</p><p>She sank down upon the sand and burst into a wild 
passion of sobs and tears.  When her fight for self-control was over and she looked up to apologize for her 
pitiful exhibition of weakness&mdash;and to note whether 
she had made an impression upon his sympathies&mdash;she 
saw him just entering the house, a quarter of a mile 
away.  To anger succeeded a mood of desperate 
forlornness.  She fell upon herself with gloomy ferocity. 
She could not sing.  She had no brains.  She was taking 
money&mdash;a disgracefully large amount of money&mdash; 
from Stanley Baird under false pretenses.  How could 
she hope to sing when her voice could not be relied upon? 
Was not her throat at that very moment slightly sore? 
Was it not always going queer?  She&mdash;sing!  Absurd. 
Did Stanley Baird suspect?  Was he waiting for 
the time when she would gladly accept what she must 
have from him, on his own terms?  No, not on his 
terms, but on the terms she herself would arrange&mdash; 
the only terms she could make.  No, Stanley believed 
in her absolutely&mdash;believed in her career.  When he 
discovered the truth, he would lose interest in her, would 
regard her as a poor, worthless creature, would be 
eager to rid himself of her.  Instead of returning to 
the house, she went in the opposite direction, made a 
circuit and buried herself in the woods beyond the 
Shrewsbury.  She was mad to get away from her own 
company; but the only company she could fly to was 
more depressing than the solitude and the taunt and 
sneer and lash of her own thoughts.  It was late in the 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0238" n="225"/>
afternoon before she nerved herself to go home.  She 
hoped the others would have gone off somewhere; but 
they were waiting for her, Stanley anxious and Cyrilla 
Brindley irritated.  Her eyes sought Keith.  He was, 
as usual, the indifferent spectator. 
</p><p>"Where have you been?'' cried Stanley. 
</p><p>"Making up my mind,'' said she in the tone that 
forewarns of a storm. 
</p><p>A brief pause.  She struggled in vain against an 
impulse to look at Keith.  When her eyes turned in 
his direction he, not looking at her, moved in his listless 
way toward the door.  Said he: 
</p><p>"The auto's waiting.  Come on.'' 
</p><p>She vacillated, yielded, began to put on the wraps 
Stanley was collecting for her.  It was a big touring-car, and they sat two and two, with the chauffeur alone. 
Keith was beside Mildred.  When they were under way, 
she said: 
</p><p>"Why did you stop me?  Perhaps I'll never have 
the courage again.'' 
</p><p>"Courage for what?'' asked he. 
</p><p>"To take your advice, and break off.'' 
</p><p>"<hi rend="italic">My</hi> advice?'' 
</p><p>"Yes, your advice.'' 
</p><p>"You have to clutch at and cling to somebody, don't 
you?  You can't bear the idea of standing up by your 
own strength.'' 
</p><p>"You think I'm trying to fasten to you?'' she said, 
with an angry laugh. 
</p><p>"I know it.  You admitted it.  You are not satisfied 
with the way things are going.  You have doubts about 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0239" n="226"/>  
your career.  You shrink from your only comfortable 
alternative, if the career winks out.  You ask me my 
opinion about yourself and about careers.  I give it. 
Now, I find you asked only that you might have someone 
to lean on, to accuse of having got you into a 
mess, if doing what you think you ought to do turns out 
as badly as you fear.'' 
</p><p>It was the longest speech she had heard him make. 
She had no inclination to dispute his analysis of her 
motives.  "I did not realize it,'' said she, "but that 
is probably so.  But&mdash;remember how I was brought 
up.'' 
</p><p>"There's only one thing for you to do.'' 
</p><p>"Go back to my husband?  You know&mdash;about me 
&mdash;don't you?'' 
</p><p>"Yes'' 
</p><p>"I can't go back to him.'' 
</p><p>"No.'' 
</p><p>"Then&mdash;what?'' she asked. 
</p><p>"Go on, as now,'' replied he. 
</p><p>"You despise me, don't you?'' 
</p><p>"No.'' 
</p><p>"But you said you did.'' 
</p><p>"Dislike and despise are not at all the same.'' 
</p><p>"You admit that you dislike me,'' cried she triumphantly. 
He did not answer. 
</p><p>"You think me a weak, clinging creature, not able 
to do anything but make pretenses.'' 
</p><p>No answer. 
</p><p>"Don't you?'' she persisted. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0240" n="227"/> 
</p><p>"Probably I have about the same opinion of you that 
you have of yourself.'' 
</p><p>"What <hi rend="italic">will</hi> become of me?'' she said.  Her 
face 
lighted up with an expression of reckless beauty.  "If 
I could only get started I'd go to the devil, laughing 
and dancing&mdash;and taking a train with me.'' 
</p><p>"You <hi rend="italic">are</hi> started,'' said he, with an 
amiable smile. 
"Keep on.  But I doubt if you'll be so well amused as 
you may imagine.  Going to the devil isn't as it's 
painted in novels by homely old maids and by men too 
timid to go out of nights.  A few steps farther, and 
your disillusionment will begin.  But there'll be no 
turning back.  Already, you are almost too old to make 
a career.'' 
</p><p>"I'm only twenty-four.  I flattered myself I looked 
still younger.'' 
</p><p>"It's worse than I thought,'' said he.  "Most of 
the singers, even the second-rate ones, began at fifteen&mdash; 
began seriously.  And you haven't begun yet.'' 
</p><p>"That's unjust,'' she protested.  "I've done a little. 
Many great people would think it a great deal.'' 
</p><p>"You haven't begun yet,'' repeated he calmly.  "You 
have spent a lot of money, and have done a lot of 
dreaming and talking and listening to compliments, 
and have taken a lot of lessons of an expensive 
charlatan.  But what have those things to do with a 
career?'' 
</p><p>"You've never heard me sing.'' 
</p><p>"I do not care for singing.'' 
</p><p>"Oh!'' said she in a tone of relief.  "Then you 
know nothing about all this.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0241" n="228"/> 
</p><p>"On the contrary, I know everything about a career. 
And we were talking of careers, not of singing.'' 
</p><p>"You mean that my voice is worthless because I 
haven't the other elements?'' 
</p><p>"What else could I have meant?'' said he.  "You 
haven't the strength.  You haven't the health.'' 
</p><p>She laughed as she straightened herself.  "Do I 
look weak and sickly?'' cried she. 
</p><p>"For the purposes of a career as a female you are 
strong and well,'' said he.  "For the purpose of a 
career as a singer&mdash;''  He smiled and shook his head. 
"A singer must have muscles like wire ropes, like a 
blacksmith or a washerwoman.  The other day we were 
climbing a hill&mdash;a not very steep hill.  You stopped 
five times for breath, and twice you sat down to rest.'' 
</p><p>She was literally hanging her head with shame.  "I 
wasn't very well that day,'' she murmured. 
</p><p>"Don't deceive yourself,'' said he.  "Don't indulge 
in the fatal folly of self-excuse.'' 
</p><p>"Go on,'' she said humbly.  "I want to hear it all.'' 
</p><p>"Is your throat sore to-day?'' pursued he. 
</p><p>She colored.  "It's better,'' she murmured. 
</p><p>"A singer with sore throat!'' mocked he.  "You've 
had a slight fogginess of the voice all summer.'' 
</p><p>"It's this sea air,'' she eagerly protested.  "It 
affects everyone.'' 
</p><p>"No self-excuse, please,'' interrupted he.  "Cigarettes, 
champagne, all kinds of foolish food, an impaired 
digestion&mdash;that's the truth, and you know it.'' 
</p><p>"I've got splendid digestion!  I can eat anything!'' 
she cried.  "Oh, you don't know the first thing about 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0242" n="229"/>
singing.  You don't know about temperament, about 
art, about all the things that singing really means.'' 
</p><p>"We were talking of careers,'' said he.  "A career 
means a person who can be relied upon to do what is 
demanded of him.  A singer's career means a powerful 
body, perfect health, a sound digestion.  Without them, 
the voice will not be reliable.  What you need is not 
singing teachers, but teachers of athletics and of hygiene. 
To hear you talk about a career is like listening to a 
child.  You think you can become a professional singer 
by paying money to a teacher.  There are lawyers and 
doctors and business men in all lines who think that way 
about their professions&mdash;that learning a little routine 
of technical knowledge makes a lawyer or a doctor or 
a merchant or a financier.'' 
</p><p>"Tell me&mdash;<hi rend="italic">what</hi> ought I to learn?'' 
</p><p>"Learn to think&mdash;and to persist.  Learn to 
concentrate.  Learn to make sacrifices.  Learn to handle 
yourself as a great painter handles his brush and colors. 
Then perhaps you'll make a career as a singer.  If not, 
it'll be a career as something or other.'' 
</p><p>She was watching him with a wistful, puzzled expression. 
"Could I ever do all that?'' 
</p><p>"Anyone could, by working away at it every day. 
If you gain only one inch a day, in a year you'll have 
gained three hundred and sixty-five inches.  And if you 
gain an inch a day for a while and hold it, you soon 
begin to gain a foot a day.  But there's no need to 
worry about that.''  He was gazing at her now with an 
expression of animation that showed how feverishly alive 
he was behind that mask of calmness.  "The day's 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0243" n="230"/>   
work&mdash;that's the story of success.  Do the day's work 
persistently, thoroughly, intelligently.  Never mind 
about to-morrow.  Thinking of it means dreaming or 
despairing&mdash;both futilities.  Just the day's work.'' 
</p><p>"I begin to understand,'' she said thoughtfully. 
"You are right.  I've done nothing.  Oh, I've been a 
fool&mdash;more foolish even than I thought.'' 
</p><p>A long silence, then she said, somewhat embarrassed 
and in a low voice, though there was no danger of those 
in front of them hearing: 
</p><p>"I want you to know that there has been nothing 
wrong&mdash;between Stanley and me.'' 
</p><p>"Do you wish me to put that to your credit or to 
your discredit?'' inquired he. 
</p><p>"What do you mean?'' 
</p><p>"Why, you've just told me that you haven't given 
Stanley anything at all for his money&mdash;that you've 
cheated him outright.  The thing itself is discreditable, 
but your tone suggests that you think I'll admire you 
for it.'' 
</p><p>"Do you mean to say that you'd think more highly 
of me if I were&mdash;what most women would be in the 
same circumstances?'' 
</p><p>"I mean to say that I think the whole business is 
discreditable to both of you&mdash;to his intelligence, to 
your character.'' 
</p><p>"You are frank,'' said she, trying to hide her anger. 
</p><p>"I am frank,'' replied he, undisturbed.  He looked 
at her.  "Why should I not be?'' 
</p><p>"You know that I need you, that I don't dare 
resent,'' said she.  "So isn't it&mdash;a little cowardly?'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0244" n="231"/> 
</p><p>"Why do you need me?  Not for money, for you 
know you'll not get that.'' 
</p><p>"I don't want it,'' cried she, agitated.  "I never 
thought of it.'' 
</p><p>"Yes, you've probably thought of it,'' replied he 
coolly.  "But you will not get it.'' 
</p><p>"Well, that's settled&mdash;I'll not get it.'' 
</p><p>"Then why do you need me?  Of what use can I be 
to you?  Only one use in the world.  To tell you the 
truth&mdash;the exact truth.  Is not that so?'' 
</p><p>"Yes,'' she said.  "That is what I want from you 
&mdash;what I can't get from anyone else.  No one else 
knows the truth&mdash;not even Mrs. Brindley, though she's 
intelligent.  I take back what I said about your being 
cowardly.  Oh, you do stab my vanity so!  You 
mustn't mind my crying out.  I can't help it&mdash;at 
least, not till I get used to you.'' 
</p><p>"Cry out,'' said he.  "It does no harm.'' 
</p><p>"How wonderfully you understand me!'' exclaimed 
she.  "That's why I let you say to me anything you 
please.'' 
</p><p>He was smiling peculiarly&mdash;a smile that somehow 
made her feel uncomfortable.  She nerved herself for 
some still deeper stab into her vanity.  He said, his gaze 
upon her and ironical: 
</p><p>"I'm sorry I can't return the compliment.'' 
</p><p>"What compliment?'' asked she. 
</p><p>"Can't say that you understand me.  Why do you 
think I am doing this?'' 
</p><p>She colored.  "Oh, no indeed, Mr. Keith,'' she 
protested, "I don't think you are in love with me&mdash;or 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0245" n="232"/>
anything of that sort.  Indeed, I do not.  I know you 
better than that.'' 
</p><p>"Really?'' said he, amused.  "Then you are not 
human.'' 
</p><p>"How can you think me so vain?'' she protested. 
</p><p>"Because you are so,'' replied he.  "You are as 
vain&mdash;no more so, but just as much so&mdash;as the average 
pretty and attractive woman brought up as you 
have been.  You are not obsessed by the notion that 
your physical charms are all-powerful, and in that 
fact there is hope for you.  But you attach entirely too 
much importance to them.  You will find them a 
hindrance for a long time before they begin to be a help 
to you in your career.  And they will always be a 
temptation to you to take the easy, stupid way of making 
a living&mdash;the only way open to most women that 
is not positively repulsive.'' 
</p><p>"I think it is the most repulsive,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"Don't cant,'' replied he, unimpressed.  "It's not 
so repulsive to your sort of woman as manual labor&mdash; 
or as any kind of work that means no leisure, no luxury 
and small pay.'' 
</p><p>"I wonder,'' said Mildred.  "I&mdash;I'm afraid you're 
right.  But I <hi rend="italic">won't</hi> admit it.  I don't dare.'' 
</p><p>"That's the finest, truest thing I've ever heard you 
say,'' said Keith. 
</p><p>Mildred was pleased out of all proportion to the 
compliment.  Said she with frank eagerness, "Then 
I'm not altogether hopeless?'' 
</p><p>"As a character, no indeed,'' replied he.  "But as a 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0246" n="233"/>
career&mdash;  I was about to say, you may set your mind 
at rest.  I shall never try to collect for my services. 
I am doing all this solely out of obstinacy.'' 
</p><p>"Obstinacy?'' asked the puzzled girl. 
</p><p>"The impossible attracts me.  That's why I've never 
been interested to make a career in law or politics or 
those things.  I care only for the thing that can't be 
done.  When I saw you and studied you, as I study 
every new thing, I decided that you could not possibly 
make a career.'' 
</p><p>"Why have you changed your mind?'' she interrupted eagerly. 
</p><p>"I haven't,'' replied he.  "If I had, I should have 
lost interest in you.  Just as soon as you show signs of 
making a career, I shall lose interest in you.  I have a 
friend, a doctor, who will take only cases where cure is 
impossible.  Looking at you, it occurred to me that 
here was a chance to make an experiment more interesting 
than any of his.  And as I have no other impossible 
task inviting me at present, I decided to undertake 
you&mdash;if you were willing.'' 
</p><p>"Why do you tell me this?'' she asked.  "To 
discourage me?'' 
</p><p>"No.  Your vanity will prevent that.'' 
</p><p>"Then why?'' 
</p><p>"To clear myself of all responsibility for you.  You 
understand&mdash;I bind myself to nothing.  I am free to 
stop or to go on at any time.'' 
</p><p>"And I?'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"You must do exactly as I tell you.'' 
</p><p>"But that is not fair,'' cried she. 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0247" n="234"/> 
</p><p>"Why not?'' inquired he.  "Without me you have 
no hope&mdash;none whatever.'' 
</p><p>"I don't believe that,'' declared she.  "It is not 
true.'' 
</p><p>"Very well.  Then we'll drop the business,'' said he 
tranquilly.  "If the time comes when you see that I'm 
your only hope, and if then I'm in my present humor, 
we will go on.'' 
</p><p>And he lapsed into silence from which she soon gave 
over trying to rouse him.  She thought of what he had 
said, studied him, but could make nothing of it.  She 
let four days go by, days of increasing unrest and 
unhappiness.  She could not account for herself.  Donald 
Keith seemed to have cast a spell over her&mdash;an 
evil spell.  Her throat gave her more and more 
trouble.  She tried her voice, found that it had vanished. 
She examined herself in the glass, and saw or fancied 
that her looks were going&mdash;not so that others would 
note it, but in the subtle ways that give the first alarm 
to a woman who has beauty worth taking care of and 
thinks about it intelligently.  She thought Mrs. Brindley 
was beginning to doubt her, suspected a covert 
uneasiness in Stanley.  Her foundations, such as they 
were, seemed tottering and ready to disintegrate.  She 
saw her own past with clear vision for the first time&mdash; 
saw how futile she had been, and why Keith believed 
there was no hope for her.  She made desperate 
efforts to stop thinking about past and future, to absorb 
herself in present comfort and luxury and opportunities 
for enjoyment.  But Keith was always there&mdash;and 
to see him was to lose all capacity for enjoyment.  She 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0248" n="235"/> 
was curt, almost rude to him&mdash;had some vague idea of 
forcing him to stay away.  Yet every time she lost 
sight of him, she was in terror until she saw him again. 
</p><p>She was alone on the small veranda facing the high-road.  She happened to glance toward the station; her 
gaze became fixed, her body rigid, for, coming leisurely 
and pompously toward the house, was General 
Siddall, in the full panoply of his wonderful tailoring 
and haberdashery.  She thought of flight, but instantly 
knew that flight was useless; the little general was not 
there by accident.  She waited, her rigidity giving her 
a deceptive seeming of calm and even ease.  He entered 
the little yard, taking off his glossy hat and exposing 
the rampant toupee.  He smiled at her so slightly that 
the angle of the needle-pointed mustaches and imperial 
was not changed.  The cold, expressionless, fishy eyes 
simply looked at her. 
</p><p>"A delightful little house,'' said he, with a patronizing 
glance around.  "May I sit down?'' 
</p><p>She inclined her head. 
</p><p>"And you are looking well, charming,'' he went on, 
and he seated himself and carefully planted his neat 
boots side by side.  "For the summer there's nothing 
equal to the seashore.  You are surprised to see me?'' 
</p><p>"I thought you were abroad,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"So I was&mdash;until yesterday.  I came back because 
my men had found you.  And I'm here because I venture 
to hope that you have had enough of this foolish 
escapade.  I hope we can come to an understanding. 
I've lost my taste for wandering about.  I wish to settle 
down&mdash;to have a home and to stay in it.  By that 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0249" n="236"/>   
I mean, of course, two or three&mdash;or possibly four&mdash; 
houses, according to the season.''  Mildred sent her 
glance darting about.  The little general saw and 
began to talk more rapidly.  "I've given considerable 
thought to our&mdash;our misunderstanding.  I feel that I 
gave too much importance to your&mdash;your&mdash;  I did 
not take your youth and inexperience of the world and 
of married life sufficiently into account.  Also the first 
Mrs. Siddall was not a lady&mdash;nor the second.  A lady, 
a young lady, was a new experience to me.  I am a 
generous man.  So I say frankly that I ought to have 
been more patient.'' 
</p><p>"You said you would never see me again until I came 
to you,'' said Mildred.  As he was not looking at her, 
she watched his face.  She now saw a change&mdash;behind 
the mask.  But he went on in an unchanged voice: 
</p><p>"Were you aware that Mrs. Baird is about to sue 
her husband for a separation&mdash;not for a divorce but 
for a separation&mdash;and name you?'' 
</p><p>Mildred dropped limply back in her chair. 
</p><p>"That means scandal,'' continued Siddall, "scandal 
touching my name&mdash;my honor.  I may say, I do not 
believe what Mrs. Baird charges.  My men have had 
you under observation for several weeks.  Also, Mrs. 
Brindley is, I learn, a woman of the highest character. 
But the thing looks bad&mdash;you hiding from your husband, 
living under an assumed name, receiving the visits 
of a former admirer.'' 
</p><p>"You are mistaken,'' said Mildred.  "Mrs. Baird 
would not bring such a false, wicked charge.'' 
</p><p>"You are innocent, my dear,'' said the general. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0250" n="237"/>  
</p><p>"You don't realize how your conduct looks.  She 
intends to charge that her husband has been supporting 
you.'' 
</p><p>Mildred, quivering, started up, sank weakly back 
again. 
</p><p>"But,'' he went on, "you will easily prove that your 
money is your inheritance from your father.  I assured 
myself of that before I consented to come here.'' 
</p><p>"Consented?'' said Mildred.  "At whose request?'' 
</p><p>"That of my own generosity,'' replied he.  "But 
my honor had to be reassured.  When I was satisfied 
that you were innocent, and simply flighty and foolish, 
I came.  If there had been any taint upon you, of 
course I could not have taken you back.  As it is, I am 
willing&mdash;I may say, more than willing.  Mrs. Baird 
can be bought off and frightened off.  When she finds 
you have me to protect you, she will move very 
cautiously, you may be sure.'' 
</p><p>As the little man talked, Mildred saw and felt behind 
the mask the thoughts, the longings of his physical 
infatuation for her coiling and uncoiling and reaching 
tremulously out toward her like unclean, horrible 
tentacles.  She was drawn as far as could be back 
into her chair, and her soul was shrinking within her 
body. 
</p><p>"I am willing to make you a proper allowance, and 
to give you all proper freedom,'' he went on.  He 
showed his sharp white teeth in a gracious smile.  "I 
realize I must concede something of my old-fashioned 
ideas to the modern spirit.  I never thought I would, 
but I didn't appreciate how fond I was of you, my 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0251" n="238"/>  
dear.''  He mumbled his tongue and noiselessly smacked 
his thin lips.  "Yes, you are worth concessions and 
sacrifices.'' 
</p><p>"I am not going back,'' said Mildred.  "Nothing 
you could offer me would make any difference.''  She 
felt suddenly calm and strong.  She stood.  "Please 
consider this final.'' 
</p><p>"But, my dear,'' said the general softly, though 
there was a wicked gleam behind the mask, "you forget 
the scandal&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"I forget nothing,'' interrupted she.  "I shall not 
go back.'' 
</p><p>Before he could attempt further to detain her she 
opened the screen door and entered.  It closed on the 
spring and on the spring lock. 
</p><p>Donald Keith, coming in from the sea-front veranda, 
was just in time to save her from falling.  She pushed 
him fiercely away and sank down on the sofa just within 
the pretty little drawing-room.  She said: 
</p><p>"Thank you.  I didn't mean to be rude.  I was only 
angry with myself.  I'm getting to be one of those 
absurd females who blubber and keel over.'' 
</p><p>"You're white and limp,'' said he.  "What's the 
matter?'' 
</p><p>"General Siddall is out there.'' 
</p><p>"Um&mdash;he's come back, has he?'' said Keith. 
</p><p>"And I am afraid of him&mdash;horribly afraid of him.'' 
</p><p>"In some places and circumstances he would be a 
dangerous proposition,'' said Keith.  "But not here in 
the East&mdash;and not to you.'' 
</p><p>"He would do <hi rend="italic">anything</hi>.  I don't know what 
he can 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0252" n="239"/> 
do, but I am sure it will be frightful&mdash;will destroy 
me.'' 
</p><p>"You are going with him?'' 
</p><p>She laughed.  "I loathe him.  I thought I left him 
through fear and anger.  I was mistaken.  It was 
loathing.  And my fear of him&mdash;it's loathing, too.'' 
</p><p>"You mean that?'' said Keith, observing her 
intently.  "You wish to be rid of him?'' 
</p><p>"What a poor opinion you have of me,'' said she. 
"Really, I don't deserve quite that.'' 
</p><p>"Then come with me.'' 
</p><p>The look of terror and shrinking returned. 
"Where?  To see him?'' 
</p><p>"For the last time,'' said Keith.  "There'll be no 
scene.'' 
</p><p>It was the supreme test of her confidence in him. 
Without hesitation, she rose, preceded him into the hall, 
and advanced firmly toward the screen door through 
which the little general could be seen.  He was standing 
at the top step, his back to them.  At the sound 
of the opening door he turned. 
</p><p>"This is Mr. Donald Keith,'' said Mildred.  "He 
wishes to speak to you.'' 
</p><p>The general bowed; Keith bent his head.  They eyed 
each other with the measuring glance.  Keith said in his 
dry, terse way:  "I asked Miss Gower to come with me 
because I wish her to hear what I have to say to you.'' 
</p><p>"You mean my wife,'' said the general with a 
gracious smile. 
</p><p>"I mean Miss Gower,'' returned Keith.  "As you 
know, she is not your wife.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0253" n="240"/>  
</p><p>Mildred uttered a cry; but the two men continued 
to look each at the other, with impassive countenances. 
</p><p>"Your only wife is the woman who has been in the 
private insane asylum of Doctor Rivers at Pueblo, 
Colorado, for the past eleven years.  For about twenty 
years before that she was in the Delavan private asylum 
near Denver.  You could not divorce her under the laws 
of Colorado.  The divorce you got in Nevada was 
fraudulent.'' 
</p><p>"That's a lie,'' said the general coldly. 
</p><p>Keith went on, as if he had not heard:  "You will 
not annoy this lady again.  And you will stop bribing 
Stanley Baird's wife to make a fool of herself.  And 
you will stop buying houses in the blocks where Baird 
owns real estate, and moving colored families into 
them.'' 
</p><p>"I tell you that about my divorce is a lie,'' replied 
Siddall. 
</p><p>"I can prove it,'' said Keith.  "And I can prove 
that you knew it before you married your second wife.'' 
</p><p>For the first time Siddall betrayed at the surface a 
hint of how hard he was hit.  His skin grew bright yellow; 
wrinkles round his eyes and round the base of his 
nose sprang into sudden prominence. 
</p><p>"I see you know what I mean&mdash;that attempt to 
falsify the record at Carson City,'' said Keith.  He 
opened the screen door for Mildred to pass in.  He 
followed her, and the door closed behind them.  They went 
into the drawing-room.  He dropped into an easy chair, 
crossed his legs, leaned his head back indolently&mdash;a 
favorite attitude of his. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0254" n="241"/> 
</p><p>"How long have you known?'' said she.  Her cheeks 
were flushed with excitement. 
</p><p>"Oh, a good many years,'' replied he.  "It was one 
of those accidental bits of information a man runs across 
in knocking about.  As soon as Baird told me about 
you, I had the thing looked up, quietly.  I was going 
up to see him to-morrow&mdash;about the negroes and Mrs. 
Baird's suit.'' 
</p><p>"Does Stanley know?'' inquired she. 
</p><p>"No,'' said Keith.  "Not necessary.  Never will 
be.  If you like, you can have the marriage 
annulled without notoriety.  But that's not necessary, 
either.'' 
</p><p>After a long silence, she said:  "What does this 
make out of me?'' 
</p><p>"You mean, what would be thought of you, if it were 
known?'' inquired he.  "Well, it probably wouldn't 
improve your social position.'' 
</p><p>"I am disgraced,'' said she, curiously rather than 
emotionally. 
</p><p>"Would be, if it were known,'' corrected he, "and 
if you are nothing but a woman without money looking 
for a husband.  If you happened to be a singer 
or an actress, it would add to your reputation&mdash;make 
you more talked about.'' 
</p><p>"But I am not an actress or a singer.'' 
</p><p>"On the other hand, I should say you didn't amount 
to much socially.  Except in Hanging Rock, of course 
&mdash;if there is still a Hanging Rock.  Don't worry about 
your reputation.  Fussing and fretting about your 
social position doesn't help toward a career.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0255" n="242"/> 
</p><p>"Naturally, you take it coolly.  But you can hardly 
expect me to,'' cried she. 
</p><p>"You are taking it coolly,'' said he.  "Then why 
try to work yourself up into a fit of hysterics?  The 
thing is of no importance&mdash;except that you're free 
now&mdash;will never be bothered by Siddall again.  You 
ought to thank me, and forget it.  Don't be one of the 
little people who are forever agitating about trifles.'' 
</p><p>Trifles!  To speak of such things as trifles!  And 
yet&mdash;  Well, what did they actually amount to in her 
life?  "Yes, I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> free,'' she said thoughtfully.  
"I've 
got what I wanted&mdash;got it in the easiest way possible.'' 
</p><p>"That's better,'' said he approvingly. 
</p><p>"And I've burnt my bridges behind me,'' pursued 
she.  "There's nothing for me now but to go ahead.'' 
</p><p>"Which road?'' inquired he carelessly. 
</p><p>"The career,'' cried she.  "There's no other for me. 
Of course I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> marry Stanley, when he's free, as 
he 
would be before very long, if I suggested it.  Yes, I 
could marry him.'' 
</p><p>"Could you?'' observed he. 
</p><p>"Doesn't he love me?'' 
</p><p>"Undoubtedly.'' 
</p><p>"Then why do you say he would not marry me?'' 
demanded she. 
</p><p>"Did I say that?'' 
</p><p>"You insinuated it.  You suggested that there was 
a doubt.'' 
</p><p>"Then, there is no doubt?'' 
</p><p>"Yes, there is,'' she cried angrily.  "You won't let 
me enjoy the least bit of a delusion.  He might marry 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0256" n="243"/> 
me if I were famous.  But as I am now&mdash;  He's an 
inbred snob.  He can't help it.  He simply couldn't 
marry a woman in my position.  But you're overlooking 
one thing&mdash;that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> would not marry <hi rend="italic">him</hi>.'' 
</p><p>"That's unimportant, if true,'' said Keith. 
</p><p>"You don't believe it?'' 
</p><p>"I don't care anything about it, my dear lady,'' said 
Keith.  "Have you got time to waste in thinking about 
how much I am in love with you?  What a womanly 
woman you are, to be sure.  Your true woman, you 
know, never thinks of anything but love&mdash;not how 
much she loves, but how much she is loved.'' 
</p><p>"Be careful!'' she warned.  "Some day you'll go 
too far in saying outrageous things to me.'' 
</p><p>"And then?'' said he smilingly. 
</p><p>"You care nothing for our friendship?'' 
</p><p>"The experiment is the only interest I have in you,'' 
replied he. 
</p><p>"That is not true,'' said she.  "You have always 
liked me.  That's why you looked up my <orig>hus&mdash; 
General Siddal</orig> and got ready for him.  That's why you 
saved me to-day.  You are a very tender-hearted and 
generous man&mdash;and you hide it as you do everything 
else about yourself.'' 
</p><p>He was looking off into space from the depths of 
the easy chair, a mocking smile on his classical, 
impassive face. 
</p><p>"What puzzles me,'' she went on, "is why you interest 
yourself in as vain and shallow and vacillating a 
woman as I am.  You don't care for my looks&mdash;and 
that's all there is to me.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0257" n="244"/> 
</p><p>"Don't pause to be contradicted,'' said he. 
</p><p>She was in a fine humor now.  "You might at least 
have said I was up to the female average, for I am. 
What have they got to offer a man but their looks? 
Do you know why I despise men?'' 
</p><p>"Do you?'' 
</p><p>"I do.  And it's because they put up with women 
as much as they do&mdash;spend so much money on them, 
listen to their chatter, admire their ridiculous clothes. 
Oh, I understand why.  I've learned that.  And I can 
imagine myself putting up with anything in some one 
man I happened to fancy strongly.  But men are foolish 
about the whole sex&mdash;or all of them that have a 
shadow of a claim to good looks.'' 
</p><p>"Yes, the men make fools of themselves,'' admitted 
he.  "But I notice that the men manage somehow to 
make the careers, and hold on to the money and the 
power, while the women have to wheedle and fawn and 
submit in order to get what they want from the men. 
There's nothing to be said for your sex.  It's been 
hopelessly corrupted by mine.  For all the talk about 
the influence of woman, what impression has your sex 
made upon mine?  And your sex&mdash;it has been made 
by mine into exactly what we wished it to be.  Take 
my advice, get out of your sex.  Abandon it, and make 
a career.'' 
</p><p>After a while she recalled with a start the events of 
less than an hour ago&mdash;events that ought to have 
seemed wildly exciting, arousing the deepest and strongest 
emotions.  Yet they had made no impression upon 
her.  Absolutely none.  She had no horror in the 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0258" n="245"/> 
thought that she had been the victim of a bigamist; 
she had no elation over her release into freedom and 
safety.  She wondered whether this arose from utter 
frivolousness or from indifference to the trifles of 
conventional joys, sorrows, agitations, excitements which 
are the whole life of most people&mdash;that indifference 
which is the cause of the general opinion that men and 
women who make careers are usually hardened in the 
process. 
</p><p>As she lay awake that night&mdash;she had got a very 
bad habit of lying awake hour after hour&mdash;she suddenly 
came to a decision.  But she did not tell Keith 
for several days.  She did it in this way: 
</p><p>"Don't you think I'm looking better?'' she asked. 
</p><p>"You're sleeping again,'' said he. 
</p><p>"Do you know why?  Because my mind's at rest. 
I've decided to accept your offer.'' 
</p><p>"And my terms?'' said he, apparently not interested 
by her announcement. 
</p><p>"And your terms,'' assented she.  "You are free to 
stop whenever the whim strikes you; I must do exactly 
as you bid.  What do you wish me to do?'' 
</p><p>"Nothing at present,'' replied he.  "I will let you 
know.'' 
</p><p>She was disappointed.  She had assumed that something&mdash; 
something new and interesting, probably irritating, 
perhaps enraging, would occur at once.  His 
indifference, his putting off to a future time, which his 
manner made seem most hazily indefinite, gave her the 
foolish and collapsing sense of having broken through 
an open door. </p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0259" n="246"/> 
<head> VII </head> 
<p>THE first of September they went up to town. 
Stanley left at once for his annual shooting trip; 
Donald Keith disappeared, saying&mdash;as was his habit&mdash; 
neither what he was about nor when he would be seen 
again.  Mrs. Brindley summoned her pupils and her 
musical friends.  Mildred resumed the lessons with 
Jennings.  There was no doubt about it, she had 
astonishingly improved during the summer.  There had 
come&mdash;or, rather, had come back&mdash;into her voice the 
birdlike quality, free, joyous, spontaneous, that had not 
been there since her father's death and the family's 
downfall.  She was glad that her arrangement with 
Donald Keith was of such a nature that she was really 
not bound to go on with it&mdash;if he should ever come 
back and remind her of what she had said.  Now that 
Jennings was enthusiastic&mdash;giving just and deserved 
praise, as her own ear and Mrs. Brindley assured her, 
she was angry at herself for having tolerated Keith's 
frankness, his insolence, his insulting and contemptuous 
denials of her ability.  She was impatient to see him, 
that she might put him down.  She said to Jennings: 
</p><p>"You think I can make a career?'' 
</p><p>"There isn't a doubt in my mind now,'' replied he. 
"You ought to be one of the few great lyric sopranos 
within five years.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0260" n="247"/>  
</p><p>"A man, this summer&mdash;a really unusual man in 
some ways&mdash;told me there was no hope for me.'' 
</p><p>"A singing teacher?'' 
</p><p>"No, a lawyer.  A Mr. Keith&mdash;Donald Keith.'' 
</p><p>"I've heard of him,'' said Jennings.  "His mother 
was Rivi, the famous coloratura of twenty years ago.'' 
</p><p>Mildred was astounded.  "He must know something 
about music.'' 
</p><p>"Probably,'' replied Jennings.  "He lived with her 
in Italy, I believe, until he was almost grown.  Then 
she died.  You sang for him?'' 
</p><p>"No,'' Mildred said it hesitatingly. 
</p><p>"Oh!'' said Jennings, and his expression&mdash;interested, 
disturbed, puzzled&mdash;made Mildred understand 
why she had been so reluctant to confess.  Jennings 
did not pursue the subject, but abruptly began the 
lesson.  That day and several days thereafter he put her 
to tests he had never used before.  She saw that he 
was searching for something&mdash;for the flaw implied in 
the adverse verdict of the son of Lucia Rivi.  She was 
enormously relieved when he gave over the search without 
having found the flaw.  She felt that Donald 
Keith's verdict had been proved false or at least faulty. 
Yet she was not wholly reassured, and from time to time 
she suspected that Jennings had not been, either. 
</p><p>Soon the gayety of the preceding winter and spring 
was in full swing again.  Keith did not return, did not 
write, and Cyrilla Brindley inquired and telephoned in 
vain.  Mildred worked with enthusiasm, with hope, 
presently with confidence.  She hoped every day that Keith 
would come; she would make him listen to her, force him 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0261" n="248"/>
to admit.  She caught a slight cold, neglected it, tried 
to sing it away.  Her voice left her abruptly.  She 
went to Jennings as usual the day she found herself 
able to do nothing more musical than squeak.  She told 
him her plight.  Said he: 
</p><p>"Begin!  Let's hear.'' 
</p><p>She made a few dismal attempts, stopped short, and, 
half laughing, half ashamed, faced him for the lecture 
she knew would be forthcoming.  Now, it so happened 
that Jennings was in a frightful humor that day&mdash;one 
of those humors in which the most prudent lose their 
self-control.  He had been listening to a succession of 
new pupils&mdash;women with money and no voice, women 
who screeched and screamed and thoroughly enjoyed 
themselves and angled confidently for compliments.  As 
Jennings had an acute musical ear, his sufferings had 
been frightful.  He was used to these torments, had the 
habit of turning the fury into which they put him into 
excellent financial or disciplinary account.  But on this 
particular day his nerves went to pieces, and it was with 
Mildred that the explosion came.  When she looked at 
him, she was horrified to see a face distorted and 
discolored by sheer rage. 
</p><p>"You fool!'' he shouted, storming up and down. 
"You fool!  You can't sing!  Keith was right.  You 
wouldn't do even for a church choir.  You can't be 
relied on.  There's nothing behind your voice&mdash;no 
strength, no endurance, no brains.  No brains!  Do 
you hear?&mdash;no brains, I say!'' 
</p><p>Mildred was terrified.  She had seen him in tantrums 
before, but always there had been a judicious reserving 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0262" n="249"/> 
of part of the truth.  Instead of resenting, instead of 
flashing eye or quivering lips, Mildred sat down and with 
white face and dazed eyes stared straight before her. 
Jennings raved and roared himself out.  As he came 
to his senses from this debauch of truth-telling his first 
thought was how expensive it might be.  Thus, long 
before there was any outward sign that the storm had 
passed, the ravings, the insults were shrewdly tempered 
with qualifyings.  If she kept on catching these colds, 
if she did not obey his instructions, she might put off 
her d&eacute;but for years&mdash;for three years, for two years at 
least.  And she would always be rowing with managers 
and irritating the public&mdash;and so on and on.  But 
the mischief had been done.  The girl did not rouse. 
</p><p>"No use to go on to-day,'' he said gruffly&mdash;the 
pretense at last rumblings of an expiring storm. 
</p><p>"Nor any other day,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>She stood and straightened herself.  Her face was 
beautiful rather than lovely.  Its pallor, its strong 
lines, the melancholy intensity of the eyes, made her 
seem more the woman fully developed, less, far less, the 
maturing girl. 
</p><p>"Nonsense!'' scolded Jennings.  "But no more 
colds like that.  They impair the quality of the voice.'' 
</p><p>"I have no voice,'' said the girl.  "I see the truth.'' 
</p><p>Jennings was inwardly cursing his insane temper. 
In about the kindliest tone he had ever used with her, 
he said:  "My dear Miss Stevens, you are in no 
condition to judge to-day.  Come back to-morrow.  Do 
something for that cold to-night.  Clear out the throat 
&mdash;and come back to-morrow.  You will see.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0263" n="250"/> 
</p><p>"Yes, I know those tricks,'' said she, with a sad little 
smile.  "You can make a crow seem to sing.  But you 
told me the truth.'' 
</p><p>"To-morrow,'' he cried pleasantly, giving her an 
encouraging pat on the shoulder.  He knew the folly of 
talking too much, the danger of confirming her fears by 
pretending to make light of them.  "A good sleep, and 
to-morrow things will look brighter.'' 
</p><p>He did not like her expression.  It was not the one 
he was used to seeing in those vain, "temperamental'' 
pupils of his&mdash;the downcast vanity that will be up 
again in a few hours.  It was rather the expression of 
one who has been finally and forever disillusioned. 
</p><p>On her way home she stopped to send Keith a 
telegram:  "I must see you at once.'' 
</p><p>There were several at the apartment for tea, among 
them Cullan, an amateur violinist and critic on music 
whom she especially liked.  For, instead of the dreamy, 
romantic character his large brown eyes and sensitive 
features suggested, he revealed in talk and actions a 
boyish gayety&mdash;free, be it said, from boyish silliness&mdash; 
that was most infectious.  His was one of those souls 
that put us in the mood to laugh at all seriousness, to 
forget all else in the supreme fact of the reality of 
existence.  He made her forget that day&mdash;forget until 
Keith's answering telegram interrupted:  "Next Monday 
afternoon.'' 
</p><p>A week less a day away!  She shrank and trembled 
at the prospect of relying upon herself alone for six 
long days.  Every prop had been taken away from her. 
Even the dubious prop of the strange, unsatisfactory 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0264" n="251"/>
Keith.  For had he not failed her?  She had said, 
"must'' and "at once''; and he had responded with 
three words of curt refusal. 
</p><p>After dinner Stanley unexpectedly appeared.  He 
hardly waited for the necessary formalities of the 
greeting before he said to Mrs. Brindley:  "I want to see 
Mildred alone.  I know you won't mind, Mrs. Brindley. 
It's very important.''  He laughed nervously but cheerfully. 
"And in a few minutes I'll call you in.  I think 
I'll have something interesting to tell you.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley laughed.  With her cigarette in one 
hand and her cup of after-dinner coffee in the other, 
she moved toward the door, saying gayly to Mildred: 
</p><p>"I'll be in the next room.  If you scream I shall 
hear.  So don't be alarmed.'' 
</p><p>Stanley closed the door, turned beaming upon 
Mildred.  Said he:  "Here's my news.  My missus has 
got her divorce.'' 
</p><p>Mildred started up. 
</p><p>"Yes, the real thing,'' he assured her.  "Of course 
I knew what was doing.  But I kept mum&mdash;didn't 
want to say anything to you till I could say everything. 
Mildred, I'm free.  We can be married to-morrow, if 
you will.'' 
</p><p>"Then you know about me?'' said she, confused. 
</p><p>"On the way I stopped in to see Keith.  He told me 
about that skunk&mdash;told me you were free, too.'' 
</p><p>Mildred slowly sat down.  Her elbows rested upon 
the table.  There was her bare forearm, slender and 
round, and her long, graceful fingers lay against her 
cheek.  The light from above reflected charmingly 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0265" n="252"/>  
from the soft waves and curves of her hair.  "You're 
lovely&mdash;simply lovely!'' cried Stanley.  "Mildred&mdash; 
darling&mdash;you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> marry me, won't you?  You can 
go right on with the career, if you like.  In fact, I'd 
rather you would, for I'm frightfully proud of your 
voice.  And I've changed a lot since I became sincerely 
interested in you.  The other sort of life and people 
don't amuse me any more.  Mildred, say you'll 
marry me.  I'll make you as happy as the days are 
long.'' 
</p><p>She moved slightly.  Her hand dropped to the table. 
</p><p>"I guess I came down on you too suddenly,'' said 
he.  "You look a bit dazed.'' 
</p><p>"No, I'm not dazed,'' replied she. 
</p><p>"I'll call Mrs. Brindley in, and we'll all three talk 
it over.'' 
</p><p>"Please don't,'' said she.  "I've got to think it out 
for myself.'' 
</p><p>"I know there isn't anyone else,'' he went on.  "So, 
I'm sure&mdash;dead sure, Mildred, that I can teach you 
to love me.'' 
</p><p>She looked at him pleadingly.  "I don't have to 
answer right away?'' 
</p><p>"Certainly not,'' laughed he.  "But why shouldn't 
you?  What is there against our getting married? 
Nothing.  And everything for it.  Our marriage will 
straighten out all the&mdash;the little difficulties, and you 
can go ahead with the singing and not bother about 
money, or what people might say, or any of those 
things.'' 
</p><p>"I&mdash;I've got to think about it, Stanley,'' she said 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0266" n="253"/> 
gently.  "I want to do the decent thing by you and 
by myself.'' 
</p><p>"You're afraid I'll interfere in the career&mdash;won't 
want you to go on?  Mildred, I swear I'm&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"It isn't that,'' she interrupted, her color high. 
"The truth is&mdash;'' she faltered, came to a full stop&mdash; 
cried, "Oh, I can't talk about it to-night.'' 
</p><p>"To-morrow?'' he suggested. 
</p><p>"I&mdash;don't know,'' she stammered.  "Perhaps to-morrow.  But it may be two or three days.'' 
</p><p>Stanley looked crestfallen.  "That hurts, Mildred,'' 
he said.  "I was <hi rend="italic">so</hi> full of it, so anxious to be 
entirely 
happy, and I thought you'd fall right in with it. 
Something to do with money?  You're horribly sensitive 
about money, dear.  I like that in you, of course. 
Not many women would have been as square, would 
have taken as little&mdash;and worked hard&mdash;and thought 
and cared about nothing but making good&mdash;  By Jove, 
it's no wonder I'm stark crazy about <hi rend="italic">you!</hi>'' 
</p><p>She was flushed and trembling.  "Don't,'' she 
pleaded.  "You're beating me down into the dust.  I 
&mdash;I'm&mdash;''  She started up.  "I can't talk to-night. 
I might say things I'd be&mdash;  I can't talk about it.  I 
must&mdash;'' 
</p><p>She pressed her lips together and fled through the 
hall to her own room, to shut and lock herself in.  He 
stared in amazement.  When he heard the distant sound 
of the turning key he dropped to a chair again and 
laughed.  Certainly women were queer creatures&mdash; 
always doing what one didn't expect.  Still, in the end&mdash; 
well, a sensible woman knew a good chance to marry 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0267" n="254"/>  
and took it.  There was no doubt a good deal of 
pretense in Mildred's delicacy as to money matters&mdash;but 
a devilish creditable sort of pretense.  He liked the 
ladylike, "nice'' pretenses, of women of the right sort 
&mdash;liked them when they fooled him, liked them when 
they only half fooled him. 
</p><p>Presently he knocked on the door of the little library, 
opened it when permission came in Cyrilla's voice.  She 
was reading the evening paper&mdash;he did not see the 
glasses she hastily thrust into a drawer.  In that soft 
light she looked a scant thirty, handsome, but for his 
taste too intellectual of type to be attractive&mdash;except 
as a friend. 
</p><p>"Well,'' said he, as he lit a cigarette and dropped the 
match into the big copper ash-bowl, "I'll bet you can't 
guess what I've been up to.'' 
</p><p>"Making love to Miss Stevens,'' replied she.  "And 
very foolish it is of you.  She's got a steady head 
in that way.'' 
</p><p>"You're mighty right,'' said he heartily.  "And I 
admire her for that more than for anything else.  I'd 
trust her anywhere.'' 
</p><p>"You're paying yourself a high compliment,'' 
laughed Cyrilla. 
</p><p>"How's that?'' inquired he.  "You're too subtle 
for me.  I'm a bit slow.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley decided against explaining.  It was 
not wise to risk raising an unjust doubt in the mind 
of a man who fancied that a woman who resisted him 
would be adamant to every other man.  "Then I've got 
to guess again?'' said she. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0268" n="255"/>  
</p><p>"I've been asking her to marry me,'' said Stanley, 
who could contain it no longer.  "Mrs. B. was released 
from me to-day by the court in Providence.'' 
</p><p>"But <hi rend="italic">she's</hi> not free,'' said Cyrilla, a 
little severely. 
</p><p>Stanley looked confused, finally said:  "Yes, she is. 
It's a queer story.  Don't say anything.  I can't 
explain.  I know I can trust you to keep a close mouth.'' 
</p><p>"Minding my own business is my one supreme talent,'' 
said Cyrilla. 
</p><p>"She hasn't accepted me&mdash;in so many words,'' pursued 
Baird, "but I've hopes that it'll come out all 
right.'' 
</p><p>"Naturally,'' commented Cyrilla dryly. 
</p><p>"I know I'm not&mdash;not objectionable to her.  And 
how I do love her!''  He settled himself at his ease. 
"I can't believe it's really me.  I never thought I'd 
marry&mdash;just for love.  Did you?'' 
</p><p>"You're very self-indulgent,'' said Cyrilla. 
</p><p>"You mean I'm marrying her because I can't get 
her any other way.  There's where you're wrong, Mrs. 
Brindley.  I'm marrying her because I don't want her 
any other way.  That's why I know it's love.  I didn't 
think I was capable of it.  Of course, I've been rather 
strong after the ladies all my life.  You know how it 
is with men.'' 
</p><p>"I do,'' said Mrs. Brindley. 
</p><p>"No, you don't either,'' retorted he.  "You're one 
of those cold, stand-me-off women who can't comprehend 
the nature of man.'' 
</p><p>"As you please,'' said she.  In her eyes there was a 
gleam that more than suggested a possibility of some 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0269" n="256"/>  
man&mdash;some man she might fancy&mdash;seeing an amazingly 
different Cyrilla Brindley. 
</p><p>"I may say I was daft about pretty women,'' 
continued Baird.  "I never read an item about a pretty 
woman in the papers, or saw a picture of a pretty woman 
that I didn't wish I knew her&mdash;well.  Can you imagine 
that?'' laughed he. 
</p><p>"Commonplace,'' said Cyrilla.  "All men are so. 
That's why the papers always describe the woman as 
pretty and why the pictures are published.'' 
</p><p>"Really?  Yes, I suppose so.''  Baird looked 
chagrined.  "Anyhow, here I am, all for one woman. 
And why?  I can't explain it to myself.  She's pretty, 
lovely, entrancing sometimes.  She has charm, grace, 
sweetness.  She dresses well and carries herself with a 
kind of sweet haughtiness.  She looks as if she knew a 
lot&mdash;and nothing bad.  Do you know, I can't imagine 
her having been married to that beast!  I've tried to 
imagine it.  I simply can't.'' 
</p><p>"I shouldn't try if I were you,'' said Mrs. Brindley. 
</p><p>"But I was talking about why I love her.  Does this 
bore you?'' 
</p><p>"A little,'' laughed Cyrilla.  "I'd rather hear some 
man talking about <hi rend="italic">my</hi> charms.  But go on.  You are 
amusing, in a way.'' 
</p><p>"I'll wager I am.  You never thought I'd be caught? 
I believed I was immune&mdash;vaccinated against it.  I 
thought I knew all the tricks and turns of the sex.  Yet 
here I am!'' 
</p><p>"What do you think caught you?'' 
</p><p>"That's the mystery.  It's simply that I can't do 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0270" n="257"/> 
without her.  Everything she looks and says and does 
interests me more than anything else in the world.  And 
when I'm not with her I'm wishing I were and wondering 
how she's looking or what she's saying or doing.  You 
don't think she'll refuse me?''  This last with real 
anxiety. 
</p><p>"I haven't an idea,'' replied Mrs. Brindley.  "She's 
&mdash;peculiar.  In some moods she would.  In others, she 
couldn't.  And I've never been able to settle to my 
satisfaction which kind of mood was the real Mary 
Stevens.'' 
</p><p>"She <hi rend="italic">is</hi> queer, isn't she?'' said Stanley 
thoughtfully. 
"But I've told her she'd be free to go on with the 
career.  Fact is, I want her to do it.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley's eyes twinkled.  "You think it would 
justify you to your set in marrying her, if she made 
a great hit?'' 
</p><p>Stanley blushed ingenuously.  "I'll not deny that has 
something to do with it,'' he admitted.  "And why 
not?'' 
</p><p>"Why not, indeed?'' said she.  "But, after she had 
made the hit, you'd want her to quit the stage and take 
her place in society.  Isn't that so?'' 
</p><p>"You <hi rend="italic">are</hi> a keen one,'' exclaimed he 
admiringly. 
"But I didn't say that to her.  And you won't, will 
you?'' 
</p><p>"It's hardly necessary to ask that,'' said Mrs. 
Brindley.  "Now, suppose&mdash;  You don't mind my talking 
about this?'' 
</p><p>"What I want,'' replied he.  "I can't talk or think 
anything but her.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0271" n="258"/>
</p><p>"Now, suppose she shouldn't make a hit.  Suppose 
she should fail&mdash;should not develop reliable voice 
enough?'' 
</p><p>Stanley looked frightened.  "But she can't fail,'' 
he cried with over-energy.  "There's no question about 
her voice.'' 
</p><p>"I understand,'' Mrs. Brindley hastened to say.  "I 
was simply making conversation with her as the subject.'' 
</p><p>"Oh, I see.''  Stanley settled back. 
</p><p>"Suppose she should prove not to be a great artist&mdash; 
what then?'' persisted Cyrilla, who was deeply interested 
in the intricate obscure problem of what people 
really thought as distinguished from what they professed 
and also from what they imagined they thought. 
</p><p>"The fact that she's a great artist&mdash;that's part of 
her,'' said Baird.  "If she weren't a great singer, she 
wouldn't be she&mdash;don't you see?'' 
</p><p>"Yes, I see,'' said Mrs. Brindley with an ironic 
sadness which she indulged openly because there was no 
danger of his understanding. 
</p><p>"I don't exactly love her because she amounts to a 
lot&mdash;or is sure to,'' pursued he, vaguely dissatisfied 
with himself.  "It's just as she doesn't care for me 
because I've got the means to take care of her right, yet 
that's part of me&mdash;and she'd not be able to marry me 
if I hadn't.  Don't you see?'' 
</p><p>"Yes, I see,'' said Mrs. Brindley with more irony 
and less sadness.  "There's always <hi rend="italic">some</hi> reason 
beside 
love.'' 
</p><p>"I'd say there's always some reason <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 
love,'' said 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0272" n="259"/> 
Baird, and he felt that he had said something brilliant&mdash; 
as is the habit of people of sluggish mentality when 
they say a thing they do not themselves understand. 
"You don't doubt that I love her?'' he went on.  "Why 
should I ask her to marry me if I didn't?'' 
</p><p>"I suppose that settles it,'' said Cyrilla. 
</p><p>"Of course it does,'' declared he. 
</p><p>For an hour he sat there, talking on, most of it a 
pretty dull kind of drivel.  Mrs. Brindley listened 
patiently, because she liked him and because she had 
nothing else to do until bedtime.  At last he rose with 
a long sigh and said: 
</p><p>"I guess I might as well be going.'' 
</p><p>"She'll not come in to-night again,'' said Cyrilla 
slyly. 
</p><p>He laughed.  "You are a good one.  I'll own up, 
I've been staying on partly in the hope that she'd come 
back.  But it's been a great joy to talk to you about 
her.  I know you love her, too.'' 
</p><p>"Yes, I'm extremely fond of her,'' said she.  "I've 
not known many women&mdash;many people without petty 
mean tricks.  She's one.'' 
</p><p>"Isn't she, though?'' exclaimed he. 
</p><p>"I don't mean she's perfect,'' said Mrs. Brindley. 
"I don't even mean that she's as angelic as you think 
her.  I'd not like her, if she were.  But she's a superior 
kind of human.'' 
</p><p>She was tired of him now, and got him out speedily. 
As she closed the front door upon him, Mildred's door, 
down the hall, opened.  Her head appeared, an inquiring 
look upon her face.  Mrs. Brindley nodded.  Mil-
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0273" n="260"/> 
dred, her hair done close to her head, a dressing-robe 
over her nightgown and her bare feet in little slippers, 
came down the hall.  She coiled herself up in a big 
chair in the library and lit a cigarette.  She looked 
like a handsome young boy. 
</p><p>"He told you?'' she said to Mrs. Brindley. 
</p><p>"Yes,'' replied Cyrilla. 
</p><p>Silence.  In all their intimate acquaintance there had 
never been an approach to the confidential on either 
side.  It was Cyrilla's notion that confidences were a 
mistake, and that the more closely people were thrown 
together the more resolutely they ought to keep certain 
barriers between them.  She and Mildred got on too 
admirably, liked each other too well, for there to be 
any trifling with their relations&mdash;and over-intimacy 
inevitably led to trifling.  Mildred had restrained 
herself because Mrs. Brindley had compelled it by rigid 
example.  Often she had longed to talk things over, 
to ask advice; but she had never ventured further than 
generalities, and Mrs. Brindley had never proffered 
advice, had never accepted opportunities to give it 
except in the vaguest way.  She had taught Mildred a 
great deal, but always by example, by doing, never by 
saying what ought or ought not to be done.  Thus, 
such development of Mildred's character as there had 
been was natural and permanent. 
</p><p>"He has put me in a peculiar position,'' said 
Mildred.  "Or, rather, I have let myself drift into a 
peculiar position.  For I think you're right in saying 
that oneself is always to blame.  Won't you let me talk 
about it to you, please?  I know you hate confidences. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0274" n="261"/> 
But I've got to&mdash;to talk.  I'd like you to advise me, 
if you can.  But even if you don't, it'll do me good to 
say things aloud.'' 
</p><p>"Often one sees more clearly,'' was Cyrilla's reply&mdash; 
noncommittal, yet not discouraging. 
</p><p>"I'm free to marry him,'' Mildred went on.  "That 
is, I'm not married.  I'd rather not explain&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"Don't,'' said Mrs. Brindley.  "It's unnecessary.'' 
</p><p>"You know that it's Stanley who has been lending 
me the money to live on while I study.  Well, from 
the beginning I've been afraid I'd find myself in a 
difficult position.'' 
</p><p>"Naturally,'' said Mrs. Brindley, as she paused. 
</p><p>"But I've always expected it to come in another 
way&mdash;not about marriage, but&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"I understand,'' said Mrs. Brindley.  "You feared 
you'd be called on to pay in the way women usually 
pay debts to men.'' 
</p><p>Mildred nodded.  "But this is worse than I expected 
&mdash;much worse.'' 
</p><p>"I hadn't thought of that,'' said Cyrilla.  "Yes, 
you're right.  If he had hinted the other thing, you 
could have pretended not to understand.  If he had 
suggested it, you could have made him feel cheap and 
mean.'' 
</p><p>"I did,'' said Mildred.  "He has been&mdash;really 
wonderful&mdash;better than almost any man would have been&mdash; 
more considerate than I deserved.  And I took advantage 
of it.'' 
</p><p>"A woman has to,'' said Cyrilla.  "The fight 
between men and women is so unequal.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0275" n="262"/> 
</p><p>"I took advantage of him,'' repeated Mildred. 
"And he apologized, and I&mdash;I went on taking the 
money.  I didn't know what else to do.  Isn't that 
dreadful?'' 
</p><p>"Nothing to be proud of,'' said Cyrilla.  "But a 
very usual transaction.'' 
</p><p>"And then,'' pursued Mildred, "I discovered that 
I&mdash;that I'd not be able to make a career.  But still 
I kept on, though I've been trying to force myself to&mdash; 
to show some pride and self-respect.  I discovered it 
only a short time ago, and it wasn't really until to-day 
that I was absolutely sure.'' 
</p><p>"You <hi rend="italic">are</hi> sure?'' 
</p><p>"There's hardly a doubt,'' replied Mildred.  "But 
never mind that now.  I've got to make a living at 
something, and while I'm learning whatever it is, I've 
got to have money to live on.  And I can get it only 
from him.  Now, he asks me to marry him.  He 
wouldn't ask me if he didn't think I was going to be 
a great singer.  He doesn't know it, but I do.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley smiled sweetly. 
</p><p>"And he thinks that I love him, also.  If I accept 
him, it will be under doubly false pretenses.  If I refuse 
him I've got to stop taking the money.'' 
</p><p>A long silence; then Mrs. Brindley said:  "Women&mdash; 
the good ones, too&mdash;often feel that they've a right to 
treat men as men treat them.  I think almost any woman 
would feel justified in putting off the crisis.'' 
</p><p>"You mean, I might tell him I'd give him my answer 
when I was independent and had paid back.'' 
</p><p>Cyrilla nodded.  Mildred relit her cigarette, which 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0276" n="263"/>   
she had let go out.  "I had thought of that,'' said she. 
"But&mdash;I doubt if he'd tolerate it.  Also''&mdash;she 
laughed with the peculiar intonation that accompanies 
the lifting of the veil over a deeply and carefully hidden 
corner of one's secret self&mdash;"I am afraid.  If I don't 
marry him, in a few weeks, or months at most, he'll 
probably find out that I shall never be a great singer, 
and then I'd not be able to marry him if I wished to.'' 
</p><p>"He <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a temptation,'' said Cyrilla.  
"That is, his 
money is&mdash;and he personally is very nice.'' 
</p><p>"I married a man I didn't care for,'' pursued 
Mildred.  "I don't want ever to do that again.  It is&mdash; 
even in the best circumstances&mdash;not agreeable, not as 
simple as it looks to the inexperienced girls who are 
always doing it.'' 
</p><p>"Still, a woman can endure that sort of thing,'' said 
Mrs. Brindley, "unless she happens to be in love with 
another man.''  She was observing the unconscious Mildred 
narrowly, a state of inward tension and excitement 
hinted in her face, but not in her voice. 
</p><p>"That's just it?'' said Mildred, her face carefully 
averted.  "I&mdash;I happen to be in love with another 
man.'' 
</p><p>A spasm of pain crossed Cyrilla's face. 
</p><p>"A man who cares nothing about me&mdash;and never 
will.  He's just a friend&mdash;so much the friend that he 
couldn't possibly think of me as&mdash;as a woman, needing 
him and wanting him''&mdash;her eyes were on fire now, and 
a soft glow had come into her cheeks&mdash;"and never 
daring to show it because if I did he would fly and never 
let me see him again.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0277" n="264"/>  
</p><p>Cyrilla Brindley's face was tragic as she looked at 
the beautiful girl, so gracefully adjusted to the big 
chair.  She sighed covertly.  "You are lovely,'' she 
said, "and young&mdash;above all, young.'' 
</p><p>"This man is peculiar,'' replied Mildred forlornly. 
"Anyhow, he doesn't want <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.  He knows me for the 
futile, weak, worthless creature I am.  He saw through 
my bluff, even before I saw through it myself.  If it 
weren't for him, I could go ahead&mdash;do the sensible 
thing&mdash;do as women usually do.  But&mdash;''  She came 
to a full stop. 
</p><p>"Love is a woman's sense of honor,'' said Cyrilla 
softly.  "We're merciless and unscrupulous&mdash;anything&mdash; 
everything&mdash;where we don't love.  But where 
we do love, we'll go farther for honor than the most 
honorable man.  That's why we're both worse and better 
than men&mdash;and seem to be so contradictory and 
puzzling.'' 
</p><p>"I'd do anything for him,'' said Mildred.  She smiled 
drearily.  "And he wants nothing.'' 
</p><p>She had nothing more to say.  She had talked herself 
out about Stanley, and her mind was now filled with 
thoughts that could not be spoken.  As she rose to 
go to bed, she looked appealingly at Cyrilla.  Then, 
with a sudden and shy rush she flung her arms round 
her and kissed her.  "Thank you&mdash;so much,'' she said. 
"You've done me a world of good.  Saying it all out 
loud before <hi rend="italic">you</hi> has made me see.  I know my own 
mind, now.'' 
</p><p>She did not note the pathetic tenderness of Cyrilla's 
face as she said, "Good night, Mildred.''  But she did 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0278" n="265"/>  
note the use of her first name&mdash;and her own right first 
name&mdash;for the first time since they had known each 
other.  She embraced and kissed her again.  "Good 
night, Cyrilla,'' she said gratefully. 
 
</p><p>As she entered Jennings's studio the next day he looked 
at her; and when Jennings looked, he saw&mdash;as must 
anyone who lives well by playing upon human nature. 
He did not like her expression.  She did not habitually 
smile; her light-heartedness, her optimism, did not show 
themselves in that inane way.  But this seriousness of 
hers was of a new kind, of the kind that bespeaks sobriety 
and saneness of soul.  And that kind of seriousness&mdash; 
the deep, inward gravity of a person whose 
days of trifling with themselves and with the facts of 
life, and of being trifled with, are over&mdash;would have 
impressed Jennings equally had she come in laughing, 
had her every word been a jest. 
</p><p>"No, I didn't come for a lesson&mdash;at least not the 
usual kind,'' said she. 
</p><p>He was not one to yield without a struggle.  Also 
he wished to feel his way to the meaning of this new 
mood.  He put her music on the rack.  "We'll begin 
where we&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"This half-hour of your time is mine, is it not?'' 
said she quietly.  "Let's not waste any of it.  Yesterday 
you told me that I could not hope to make a career 
because my voice is unreliable.  Why is it unreliable?'' 
</p><p>"Because you have a delicate throat,'' replied he, 
yielding at once where he instinctively knew he could 
not win. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0279" n="266"/>
</p><p>"Then why can I sing so well sometimes?'' 
</p><p>"Because your throat is in good condition some days 
&mdash;in perfect condition.'' 
</p><p>"It's the colds then&mdash;and the slight attacks of 
colds?'' 
</p><p>"Certainly.'' 
</p><p>"If I did not catch colds&mdash;if I kept perfectly well 
&mdash;could I rely on my voice?'' 
</p><p>"But that's impossible,'' said he. 
</p><p>"Why?'' 
</p><p>"You're not strong enough.'' 
</p><p>"Then I haven't the physical strength for a career?'' 
</p><p>"That&mdash;and also you are lacking in muscular 
development.  But after several years of lessons&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"If I developed my muscles&mdash;if I became strong&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"Most of the great singers come from the lower 
classes&mdash;from people who do manual labor.  They did 
manual labor in their youth.  You girls of the better 
class have to overcome that handicap.'' 
</p><p>"But so many of the great singers are fat.'' 
</p><p>"Yes, and under that fat you'll find great ropes of 
muscle&mdash;like a blacksmith.'' 
</p><p>"What Keith meant,'' she said.  "I wonder&mdash; 
Why do I catch cold so easily?  Why do I almost 
always have a slight catch in the throat?  Have you 
noticed that I nearly always have to clear my throat 
just a little?'' 
</p><p>Her expression held him.  He hesitated, tried to 
evade, gave it up.  "Until that passes, you can never 
hope to be a thoroughly reliable singer,'' said he. 
</p><p>"That is, I can't hope to make a career?'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0280" n="267"/>  
</p><p>His silence was assent. 
</p><p>"But I have the voice?'' 
</p><p>"You have the voice.'' 
</p><p>"An unusual voice?'' 
</p><p>"Yes, but not so unusual as might be thought.  As 
a matter of fact, there are thousands of fine voices. 
The trouble is in reliability.  Only a few are reliable.'' 
</p><p>She nodded slowly and thoughtfully.  "I begin to 
understand what Mr. Keith meant,'' she said.  "I 
begin to see what I have to do, and how&mdash;how impossible 
it is.'' 
</p><p>"By no means,'' declared Jennings.  "If I did not 
think otherwise, I'd not be giving my time to you.'' 
</p><p>She looked at him gravely.  His eyes shifted, then 
returned defiantly, aggressively.  She said: 
</p><p>"You can't help me to what I want.  So this is 
my last lesson&mdash;for the present.  I may come back 
some day&mdash;when I am ready for what you have to 
give.'' 
</p><p>"You are going to give up?'' 
</p><p>"Oh, no&mdash;oh, dear me, no,'' replied she.  "I realize 
that you're laughing in your sleeve as I say so, because 
you think I'll never get anywhere.  But you&mdash;and 
Mr. Keith&mdash;may be mistaken.''  She drew from her 
muff a piece of music&mdash;the "Batti Batti,'' from "Don 
Giovanni.''  "If you please,'' said she, "we'll spend 
the rest of my time in going over this.  I want to be 
able to sing it as well as possible.'' 
</p><p>He looked searchingly at her.  "If you wish,'' said 
he.  "But I doubt if you'll be able to sing at all.'' 
</p><p>"On the contrary, my cold's entirely gone,'' replied 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0281" n="268"/>
she.  "I had an exciting evening, I doctored myself 
before I went to bed, and three or four times in the night. 
I found, this morning, that I could sing.'' 
</p><p>And it was so.  Never had she sung better.  "Like 
a true artist!'' he declared with an enthusiasm that had 
a foundation of sincerity.  "You know, Miss Stevens, 
you came very near to having that rarest of all gifts&mdash; 
a naturally placed voice.  If you hadn't had singing 
teachers as a girl to make you self-conscious and to teach 
you wrong, you'd have been a wonder.'' 
</p><p>"I may get it back,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"That never happens,'' replied he.  "But I can 
almost do it.'' 
</p><p>He coached her for half an hour straight ahead, 
sending the next pupil into the adjoining room&mdash;an 
unprecedented transgression of routine.  He showed 
her for the first time what a teacher he could be, when 
he wished.  There was an astonishing difference 
between her first singing of the song and her sixth 
and last&mdash;for they went through it carefully five 
times.  She thanked him and then put out her hand, 
saying: 
</p><p>"This is a long good-by.'' 
</p><p>"To-morrow,'' replied he, ignoring her hand. 
</p><p>"No.  My money is all gone.  Besides, I have no 
time for amateur trifling.'' 
</p><p>"Your lessons are paid for until the end of the 
month.  This is only the nineteenth.'' 
</p><p>"Then you are so much in.''  Again she put out her 
hand. 
</p><p>He took it.  "You owe me an explanation.'' 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0282" n="269"/> 
</p><p>She smiled mockingly.  "As a friend of mine says, 
don't ask questions to which you already know the answer.'' 
</p><p>And she departed, the smile still on her charming 
face, but the new seriousness beneath it.  As she had 
anticipated, she found Stanley Baird waiting for her 
in the drawing-room of the apartment.  Being by 
habit much interested in his own emotions and not at 
all in the emotions of others, he saw only the healthful 
radiance the sharp October air had put into her cheeks 
and eyes.  Certainly, to look at Mildred Gower was to 
get no impression of lack of health and strength.  Her 
glance wavered a little at sight of him, then the expression 
of firmness came back. 
</p><p>"You look like that picture you gave me a long time 
ago,'' said he.  "Do you remember it?'' 
</p><p>She did not. 
</p><p>"It has a&mdash;different expression,'' he went on.  "I 
don't think I'd have noticed it but for Keith.  I happened 
to show it to him one day, and he stared at it in 
that way he has&mdash;you know?'' 
</p><p>"Yes, I know,'' said Mildred.  She was seeing those 
uncanny, brilliant, penetrating eyes, in such startling 
contrast to the calm, lifeless coloring and classic chiseling 
of features. 
</p><p>"And after a while he said, `So, <hi rend="italic">that's</hi> 
Miss 
Stevens!'  And I asked him what he meant, and he took 
one of your later photos and put the two side by side. 
To my notion the later was a lot the more attractive, 
for the face was rounder and softer and didn't have a 
certain kind of&mdash;well, hardness, as if you had a will 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0283" n="270"/>  
and could ride rough shod.  Not that you look so 
frightfully unattractive.'' 
</p><p>"I remember the picture,'' interrupted Mildred.  "It 
was taken when I was twenty&mdash;just after an illness.'' 
</p><p>"The face <hi rend="italic">was</hi> thin,'' said Stanley.  
"Keith called it 
a `give away.' '' 
</p><p>"I'd like to see it,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"I'll try to find it.  But I'm afraid I can't.  I 
haven't seen it since I showed it to Keith, and when I 
hunted for it the other day, it didn't turn up.  I've 
changed valets several times in the last six months&mdash;'' 
</p><p>But Mildred had ceased listening.  Keith had seen the 
picture, had called it a "give away,'' had been interested 
in it&mdash;and the picture had disappeared.  She 
laughed at her own folly, yet she was glad Stanley had 
given her this chance to make up a silly day-dream. 
She waited until he had exhausted himself on the subject 
of valets, their drunkenness, their thievish habits, 
their incompetence, then she said: 
</p><p>"I took my last lesson from Jennings to-day.'' 
</p><p>"What's the matter?  Do you want to change? 
You didn't say anything about it?  Isn't he good?'' 
</p><p>"Good enough.  But I've discovered that my voice 
isn't reliable, and unless one has a reliable voice there's 
no chance for a grand-opera career&mdash;or for comic 
opera, either.'' 
</p><p>Stanley was straightway all agitation and protest. 
"Who put that notion in your head?  There's nothing 
in it, Mildred.  Jennings is crazy about your voice, 
and he knows.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0284" n="271"/>
</p><p>"Jennings is after the money,'' replied Mildred. 
"What I'm saying is the truth.  Stanley, our beautiful 
dream of a career has winked out.'' 
</p><p>His expression was most revealing. 
</p><p>"And,'' she went on, "I'm not going to take any 
more of your money&mdash;and, of course, I'll pay back 
what I've borrowed when I can''&mdash;she smiled&mdash;"which 
may not be very soon.'' 
</p><p>"What's all this about, anyhow?'' demanded he.  "I 
don't see any sign of it in your face.  You wouldn't 
take it so coolly if it were so.'' 
</p><p>"I don't understand why I'm not wringing my hands 
and weeping,'' replied she.  "Every few minutes I tell 
myself that I ought to be.  But I stay quite calm.  I 
suppose I'm&mdash;sort of stupefied.'' 
</p><p>"Do you really mean that you've given up?'' cried 
he. 
</p><p>"It's no use to waste the money, Stanley.  I've got 
the voice, and that's what deceived us all.  But there's 
nothing <hi rend="italic">behind</hi> the voice.  With a great singer the 
greatness is in what's behind the voice, not in the voice 
itself.'' 
</p><p>"I don't believe a word of it,'' cried he violently. 
"You've been discouraged by a little cold.  Everybody 
has colds.  Why, in this climate the colds are always 
getting the Metropolitan singers down.'' 
</p><p>"But they've got strong throats, and my throat's 
delicate.'' 
</p><p>"You must go to a better climate.  You ought to be 
abroad, anyhow.  That was part of my plan&mdash;for us 
to go abroad&mdash;''  He stopped in confusion, reddened, 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0285" n="272"/> 
went bravely on&mdash;"and you to study there and make 
your d&eacute;but.'' 
</p><p>Mildred shook her head.  "That's all over,'' said she. 
"I've got to change my plans entirely.'' 
</p><p>"You're a little depressed, that's all.  For a minute 
you almost convinced me.  What a turn you did give 
me!  I forgot how your voice sounded the last time 
I heard it.  No, you'd not be so calm, if you didn't 
know everything was all right.'' 
</p><p>Her eyes lit up with sly humor.  "Perhaps I'm 
calm because I feel that my future's secure as your wife. 
What more could a woman ask?'' 
</p><p>He forced an uncomfortable laugh.  "Of course&mdash; 
of course,'' he said with a painful effort to be easy and 
jocose. 
</p><p>"I knew you'd marry me, even if I couldn't sing a 
note.  I knew your belief in my career had nothing to 
do with it.'' 
</p><p>He hesitated, blurted out the truth.  "Speaking 
seriously, that isn't quite so,'' said he.  "I've got my 
heart set on your making a great tear&mdash;and I know 
you'll do it.'' 
</p><p>"And if you knew I wouldn't, you'd not want to 
marry me?'' 
</p><p>"I don't say that,'' protested he.  "How can I say 
how I'd feel if you were different?'' 
</p><p>She nodded.  "That's sensible, and it's candid,'' she 
said.  She laid her hand impulsively on his arm.  "I 
<hi rend="italic">do</hi> like you, Stanley.  You have got such a lot of 
good 
qualities.  Don't worry.  I'm not going to insist on 
your marrying me.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0286" n="273"/>
</p><p>"You don't have to do that, Mildred,'' said he. 
"I'm staring, raving crazy about you, though I'm a 
damn fool to let you know it.'' 
</p><p>"Yes, it is foolish,'' said she.  "If you'd kept me 
worrying&mdash;  Still, I guess not.  But it doesn't matter. 
You can protest and urge all you please, quite safely. 
I'm not going to marry you.  Now let's talk business.'' 
</p><p>"Let's talk marriage,'' said he.  "I want this thing 
settled.  You know you intend to marry me, Mildred. 
Why not say so?  Why keep me gasping on the hook?'' 
</p><p>They heard the front door open, and the rustling of 
skirts down the hall.  Mildred called: 
</p><p>"Mrs. Brindley!  Cyrilla!'' 
</p><p>An instant and Cyrilla appeared in the doorway. 
When she and Baird had shaken hands, Mildred said: 
</p><p>"Cyrilla, I want you to tell the exact, honest truth. 
Is there any hope for a woman with a delicate throat to 
make a grand-opera career?'' 
</p><p>Cyrilla paled, looked pleadingly at Mildred. 
</p><p>"Tell him,'' commanded Mildred. 
</p><p>"Very little,'' said Mrs. Brindley.  "But&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"Don't try to soften it,'' interrupted Mildred. 
"The truth, the plain truth.'' 
</p><p>"You've no right to draw me into this,'' cried Cyrilla 
indignantly, and she started to leave the room. 
</p><p>"I want him to know,'' said Mildred.  "And he 
wants to know.'' 
</p><p>"I refuse to be drawn into it,'' Cyrilla said, and 
disappeared. 
</p><p>But Mildred saw that Stanley had been shaken.  She 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0287" n="274"/> 
proceeded to explain to him at length what a singer's 
career meant&mdash;the hardships, the drafts on health and 
strength, the absolute necessity of being reliable, of 
singing true, of not disappointing audiences&mdash;what 
a delicate throat meant&mdash;how delicate her throat was 
&mdash;how deficient she was in the kind of physical strength 
needed&mdash;muscular power with endurance back of it. 
When she finished he understood. 
</p><p>"I'd always thought of it as an art,'' he said 
ruefully.  "Why, it's mostly health and muscles and 
things that have nothing to do with music.''  He was 
dazed and offended by this uncovering of the mechanism 
of the art&mdash;by the discovery of the coarse and painful 
toil, the grossly physical basis, of what had seemed 
to him all idealism.  He had been full of the delusions 
of spontaneity and inspiration, like all laymen, and all 
artists, too, except those of the higher ranks&mdash;those 
who have fought their way up to the heights and, so, 
have learned that one does not achieve them by being 
caught up to them gloriously in a fiery cloud, but by 
doggedly and dirtily and sweatily toiling over every inch 
of the cruel climb. 
</p><p>He sat silent when she had finished.  She waited, 
then said: 
</p><p>"Now, you see.  I release you, and I'll take no more 
money to waste.'' 
</p><p>He looked at her with dumb misery that smote her 
heart.  Then his expression changed&mdash;to the shining, 
hungry eyes, the swollen veins, the reddened countenance, 
the watering lips of desire.  He seized her in his 
arms, and in a voice trembling with passion, he cried: 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0288" n="275"/>
</p><p>"You must marry me, anyhow!  I've <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to 
have you, 
Mildred.'' 
</p><p>If she had loved him, his expression, his impassioned 
voice would have thrilled her.  But she did not love him. 
It took all her liking for him, and the memory of all 
she owed him&mdash;that unpaid debt!&mdash;to enable her to 
push him away gently and to say without any show of 
the repulsion she felt: 
</p><p>"Stanley, you mustn't do that.  And it's useless to 
talk of marriage.  You're generous, so you are taking 
pity on me.  But believe me, I'll get along somehow.'' 
</p><p>"Pity?  I tell you I love you,'' he cried, catching 
desperately at her hands and holding them in a grip 
she could not break.  "You've no right to treat me 
like this.'' 
</p><p>It was one of those veiled and stealthy reminders of 
obligation habitually indulged in by delicate people 
seeking repayment of the debt, but shunning the coarseness 
of direct demand.  Mildred saw her opportunity. 
Said she quietly: 
</p><p>"You mean you want me to give myself to you in 
payment, or part payment, for the money you've loaned 
me?'' 
</p><p>He released her hands and sprang up.  He had 
meant just that, but he had not had the courage, or the 
meanness, or both, to admit boldly his own secret wish. 
She had calculated on this&mdash;had calculated well. 
"Mildred!'' he cried in a shocked voice.  "<hi rend="italic">You</hi> so 
lacking in delicacy as to say such a thing!'' 
</p><p>"If you didn't mean that, Stanley, what <hi rend="italic">did</hi> 
you 
mean?'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0289" n="276"/>  
</p><p>"I was appealing to our friendship&mdash;our&mdash;our 
love for each other.'' 
</p><p>"Then you should have waited until I was free.'' 
</p><p>"Good God!'' he cried, "don't you see that's 
hopeless?  Mildred, be sensible&mdash;be merciful.'' 
</p><p>"I shall never marry a man when he could justly 
suspect I did it to live off him.'' 
</p><p>"What an idea!  It's a man's place to support a 
woman!'' 
</p><p>"I was speaking only of myself.  <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can't do 
it. 
And it's absurd for you and me to be talking about love 
and marriage when anyone can see I'd be marrying you 
only because I was afraid to face poverty and a struggle.'' 
</p><p>Her manner calmed him somewhat.  "Of course it's 
obvious that you've got to have money,'' said he, "and 
that the only way you can get it is by marriage.  But 
there's something else, too, and in my opinion it's the 
principal thing&mdash;we care for each other.  Why not be 
sensible, Mildred?  Why not thank God that as long as 
you have to marry, you can marry someone you care 
for.'' 
</p><p>"Could you feel that I cared for you, if I married 
you now?'' inquired she. 
</p><p>"Why not?  I'm not so entirely lacking in self-esteem.  I feel that I must count for something.'' 
</p><p>Mildred sat silently wondering at this phenomenon so 
astounding, yet a commonplace of masculine egotism. 
She had no conception of this vanity which causes the 
man, at whom the street woman smiles, to feel flattered, 
though he knows full well what she is and her dire ne-
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0290" n="277"/>  
cessity.  She could not doubt that he was speaking the 
truth, yet she could not believe that conceit could so 
befog common sense in a man who, for all his slowness 
and shallowness, was more than ordinarily shrewd. 
</p><p>"Even if I thought I loved you,'' said she, "I 
couldn't be sure in these circumstances that I wasn't 
after your money.'' 
</p><p>"Don't worry about that,'' replied he.  "I 
understand you better than you understand yourself.'' 
</p><p>"Let's stop talking about it,'' said she impatiently. 
"I want to explain to you the business side of this.'' 
She took her purse from the table.  "Here are the 
papers.''  She handed him a check and a note.  "I 
made them out at the bank this morning.  The note is 
for what I owe you&mdash;and draws interest at four per 
cent.  The check is for all the money I have left except 
about four hundred dollars.  I've some bills I must pay, 
and also I didn't dare quite strip myself.  The note may 
not be worth the paper it's written on, but I hope&mdash;'' 
</p><p>Before she could prevent him he took the two papers, 
and, holding them out of her reach, tore them to bits. 
</p><p>Her eyes gleamed angrily.  "I see you despise me 
&mdash;as much as I've invited.  But, I'll make them out 
again and mail them to you.'' 
</p><p>"You're a silly child,'' said he gruffly.  "We're 
going to be married.'' 
</p><p>She eyed him with amused exasperation.  "It's too 
absurd!'' she cried.  "And if I yielded, you'd be trying 
to get out of it.''  She hesitated whether to tell him 
frankly just how she felt toward him.  She decided 
against it, not through consideration&mdash;for a woman 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0291" n="278"/> 
feels no consideration for a man she does not love, if he 
has irritated her&mdash;but through being ashamed to say 
harsh things to one whom she owed so much.  "It's 
useless for you to pretend and to plead,'' she went on.  "I 
shall not yield.  You'll have to wait until I'm free and 
independent.'' 
</p><p>"You'll marry me then?'' 
</p><p>"No,'' replied she, laughing.  "But I'll be able to 
refuse you in such a way that you'll believe.'' 
</p><p>"But you've got to marry, Mildred, and right away.'' 
A suspicion entered his mind and instantly gleamed in 
his eyes.  "Are you in love with someone else?'' 
</p><p>She smiled mockingly. 
</p><p>"It looks as if you were,'' he went on, arguing with 
himself aloud.  "For if you weren't you'd marry me, 
even though you didn't like me.  A woman in your fix 
simply couldn't keep herself from it.  Is <hi rend="italic">that</hi> why 
you're so calm?'' 
</p><p>"I'm not marrying anybody,'' said she. 
</p><p>"Then what are you going to do?'' 
</p><p>"You'll see.'' 
</p><p>Once more the passionate side of his nature showed 
&mdash;not merely grotesque, unattractive, repellent, as in 
the mood of longing, but hideous.  Among men Stanley 
Baird passed for a man of rather arrogant and 
violent temper, but that man who had seen him at his 
most violent would have been amazed.  The temper men 
show toward men bears small resemblance either in kind 
or in degree to the temper of jealous passion they show 
toward the woman who baffles them or arouses their 
suspicions; and no man would recognize his most intimate 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0292" n="279"/>
man friend&mdash;or himself&mdash;when in that paroxysm. 
Mildred had seen this mood, gleaming at her through 
a mask, in General Siddall.  It had made her sick with 
fear and repulsion.  In Stanley Baird it first astounded 
her, then filled her with hate. 
</p><p>"Stanley!'' she gasped. 
</p><p>"<hi rend="italic">Who</hi> is it?'' he ground out between his 
teeth.  And 
he seized her savagely. 
</p><p>"If you don't release me at once,'' said she calmly, 
"I shall call Mrs. Brindley, and have you put out of 
the house.  No matter if I do owe you all that money.'' 
</p><p>"Stop!'' he cried, releasing her.  "You're very 
clever, aren't you?&mdash;turning that against me and making 
me powerless.'' 
</p><p>"But for that, would you dare presume to touch 
me, to question me?'' said she. 
</p><p>He lowered his gaze, stood panting with the effort to 
subdue his fury. 
</p><p>She went back to her own room.  A few hours later 
came a letter of apology from him.  She answered it 
friendlily, said she would let him know when she could 
see him again, and enclosed a note and a check. </p>

<p>MILDRED went to bed that night proud of her 
strength of character.  Were there many women&mdash; 
was there any other woman she knew or knew about&mdash; 
who in her desperate circumstances would have done 
what she had done?  She could have married a man 
who would have given her wealth and the very best 
social position.  She had refused him.  She could have 
continued to "borrow'' from him the wherewithal 
to keep her in luxurious comfort while she looked about 
at her ease for a position that meant independence. 
She had thrust the temptation from her.  All this from 
purely high-minded motives; for other motive there 
could be none.  She went to sleep, confident that on the 
morrow she would continue to tread the path of self-respect with unfaltering feet.  But when morning came 
her throat was once more slightly off&mdash;enough to make 
it wise to postpone the excursion in search of a trial 
for musical comedy.  The excitement or the reaction 
from excitement&mdash;it must be the one or the other&mdash; 
had resulted in weakness showing itself, naturally, at 
her weakest point&mdash;that delicate throat.  When life 
was calm and orderly, and her mind was at peace, the 
trouble would pass, and she could get a position of some 
kind.  Not the career she had dreamed; that was 
impossible.  But she had voice enough for a little part, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0294" n="281"/>
where a living could be made; and perhaps she would 
presently fathom the secret of the cause of her delicate 
throat and would be able to go far&mdash;possibly as far as 
she had dreamed. 
</p><p>The delay of a few days was irritating.  She would 
have preferred to push straight on, while her courage 
was taut.  Still, the delay had one advantage&mdash;she 
could prepare the details of her plan.  So, instead of 
going to the office of the theatrical manager&mdash;Crossley, 
the most successful producer of light, musical pieces 
of all kinds&mdash;she went to call on several of the girls 
she knew who were more or less in touch with matters 
theatrical.  And she found out just how to proceed 
toward accomplishing a purpose which ought not to be 
difficult for one with such a voice as hers and with 
physical charms peculiarly fitted for stage exhibition. 
</p><p>Not until Saturday was her voice at its best again. 
She, naturally, decided not to go to the theatrical office 
on Monday, but to wait until she had seen and talked 
with Keith.  One more day did not matter, and Keith 
might be stimulating, might even have some useful 
suggestions to offer.  She received him with a manner that 
was a version, and a most charming version, of his own 
tranquil indifference.  But his first remark threw her 
into a panic.  Said he: 
</p><p>"I've only a few minutes.  No, thanks, I'll not sit.'' 
</p><p>"You needn't have bothered to come,'' said she 
coldly. 
</p><p>"I always keep my engagements.  Baird tells me 
you have given up the arrangement you had with him. 
You'll probably be moving from here, as you'll not have 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0295" n="282"/>  
the money to stay on.  Send me your new address, 
please.''  He took a paper from his pocket and gave it 
to her.  "You will find this useful&mdash;if you are in 
earnest,'' said he.  "Good-by, and good luck.  I'll 
hope to see you in a few weeks.'' 
</p><p>Before she had recovered herself in the least, she was 
standing there alone, the paper in her hand, her stupefied 
gaze upon the door through which he had disappeared. 
All his movements and his speech had been 
of his customary, his invariable, deliberateness; but she 
had the impression of whirling and rushing haste. 
With a long gasping sigh she fell to trembling all over. 
She sped to her room, got its door safely closed just 
in time.  Down she sank upon the bed, to give way to 
an attack of hysterics. 
</p><p>We are constantly finding ourselves putting forth the 
lovely flowers and fruit of the virtues whereof the heroes 
and heroines of romance are so prolific.  Usually nothing 
occurs to disillusion us about ourselves.  But now 
and then fate, in unusually brutal ironic mood, forces 
us to see the real reason why we did this or that virtuous, 
self-sacrificing action, or blossomed forth in this 
or that nobility of character.  Mildred was destined 
now to suffer one of these savage blows of disillusionment 
about self that thrust us down from the exalted 
moral heights where we have been preening into humble 
kinship with the weak and frail human race.  She 
saw why she had refused Stanley, why she had stopped 
"borrowing,'' why she had put off going to the theatrical 
managers, why she had delayed moving into quarters 
within her diminished and rapidly diminishing 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0296" n="283"/>  
means.  She had been counting on Donald Keith.  She 
had convinced herself that he loved her even as she loved 
him.  He would fling away his cold reserve, would burst 
into raptures over her virtue and her courage, would 
ask her to marry him.  Or, if he should put off that, 
he would at least undertake the responsibility of getting 
her started in her career.  Well!  He had come; he 
had shown that Stanley had told him all or practically 
all; and he had gone, without asking a sympathetic 
question or making an encouraging remark.  As 
indifferent as he seemed.  Burnt out, cold, heartless. 
She had leaned upon him; he had slipped away, leaving 
her to fall painfully, and ludicrously, to the ground. 
She had been boasting to herself that she was strong, 
that she would of her own strength establish herself in 
independence.  She had not dreamed that she would be 
called upon to "make good.''  She raved against Keith, 
against herself, against fate.  And above the chaos and 
the wreck within her, round and round, hither and yon, 
flapped and shied the black thought, "What <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> I 
do?'' 
</p><p>When she sat up and dried her eyes, she chanced to 
see the paper Keith had left; with wonder at her having 
forgotten it and with a throb of hope she opened 
and began to read his small, difficult writing: 
</p><p>A career means self-denial.  Not occasional, intermittent, 
but steady, constant, daily, hourly&mdash;a purpose that 
never relaxes. 
</p><p>A career as a singer means not only the routine, the 
patient tedious work, the cutting out of time-wasting people 
and time-wasting pleasures that are necessary to any and 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0297" n="284"/> 
all careers.  It means in addition&mdash;for such a person&mdash; 
sacrifices far beyond a character so undisciplined and so 
corrupted by conventional life as is yours.  The basis of a 
singing career is health and strength.  You must have 
great physical strength to be able to sing operas.  You 
must have perfect health. 
</p><p>Diet and exercise.  A routine life, its routine rigidly 
adhered to, day in and day out, month after month, year 
after year.  Small and uninteresting and monotonous food, 
nothing to drink, and, of course, no cigarettes.  Such is 
the secret of a reliable voice for you who have a "delicate 
throat''&mdash;which is the silly, shallow, and misleading way 
of saying a delicate digestion, for sore throat always 
means indigestion, never means anything else.  To sing, 
the instrument, the absolutely material machine, must be 
in perfect order.  The rest is easy. 
</p><p>Some singers can commit indiscretions of diet and of 
lack of exercise.  But not you, because you lack this 
natural strength.  Do not be deceived and misled by their 
example. 
</p><p>Exercise.  You must make your body strong, powerful. 
You have not the muscles by nature.  You must acquire 
them. 
</p><p>The following routine of diet and exercise made one of the 
great singers, and kept her great for a quarter of a century. 
If you adopt it, without variation, you can make a career. 
If you do not, you need not hope for anything but failure 
and humiliation.  Within my knowledge sixty-eight young 
men and young women have started in on this system.  Not 
one had the character to persist to success.  This may 
suggest why, except two who are at the very top, all of the 
great singers are men and women whom nature has made 
powerful of body and of digestion&mdash;so powerful that 
their indiscretions only occasionally make them unreliable. 
</p><p>There Mildred stopped and flung the paper aside. 
She did not care even to glance at the exercises pre- 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0298" n="285"/>  
scribed or at the diet and the routine of daily work. 
How dull and uninspired!  How grossly material! 
Stomach!  Chewing!  Exercising machines!  Plodding 
dreary miles daily, rain or shine!  What could such 
things have to do with the free and glorious career of 
an inspired singer?  Keith was laughing at her as he 
hastened away, abandoning her to her fate. 
</p><p>She examined herself in the glass to make sure that 
the ravages of her attack of rage and grief and despair 
could be effaced within a few hours, then she wrote a 
note&mdash;formal yet friendly&mdash;to Stanley Baird, informing 
him that she would receive him that evening.  He 
came while Cyrilla and Mildred were having their after, 
dinner coffee and cigarettes.  He was a man who took 
great pains with his clothes, and got them where pains 
was not in vain.  That evening he had arrayed himself 
with unusual care, and the result was a fine, manly figure 
of the well-bred New-Yorker type.  Certainly Stanley 
had ground for his feeling that he deserved and got liking 
for himself.  The three sat in the library for perhaps 
half an hour, then Mrs. Brindley rose to leave the 
other two alone.  Mildred urged her to stay&mdash;Mildred 
who had been impatient of her presence when Stanley 
was announced.  Urged her to stay in such a tone that 
Cyrilla could not persist, but had to sit down again. 
As the three talked on and on, Mildred continued to 
picture life with Stanley&mdash;continued the vivid picturing 
she had begun within ten minutes of Stanley's entering, 
the picturing that had caused her to insist on Cyrilla's 
remaining as chaperon.  A young girl can do no such 
picturing as Mildred could not avoid doing.  To the 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0299" n="286"/> 
young girl married life, its t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tetes, its 
intimacies, 
its routine, are all a blank.  Any attempt she makes to 
fill in details goes far astray.  But Mildred, with Stanley 
there before her, could see her life as it would be. 
</p><p>Toward half-past ten, Stanley said, shame-faced and 
pleading, "Mildred, I should like to see you alone for 
just a minute before I go.'' 
</p><p>Mildred said to Cyrilla:  "No, don't move.  We'll 
go into the drawing-room.'' 
</p><p>He followed her there, and when the sound of Mrs. 
Brindley's step in the hall had died away, he began: 
"I think I understand you a little now.  I shan't 
insult you by returning or destroying that note or the 
check.  I accept your decision&mdash;unless you wish to 
change it.''  He looked at her with eager appeal.  His 
heart was trembling, was sick with apprehension, with 
the sense of weakness, of danger and gloom ahead. 
"Why shouldn't I help you, at least, Mildred?'' he 
urged. 
</p><p>Whence the courage came she knew not, but through 
her choking throat she forced a positive, "No.'' 
</p><p>"And,'' he went on, "I meant what I said.  I love 
you.  I'm wretched without you.  I want you to marry 
me, career or no career.'' 
</p><p>Her fears were clamorous, but she forced herself to 
say, "I can't change.'' 
</p><p>"I hoped&mdash;a little&mdash;that you sent me the note to-day because you&mdash;  You didn't?'' 
</p><p>"No,'' said Mildred.  "I want us to be friends. 
But you must keep away.'' 
</p><p>He bent his head.  "Then I'll go 'way off somewhere. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0300" n="287"/>  
I can't bear being here in New York and not seeing 
you.  And when I've been away a year or so, perhaps 
I'll get control of myself again.'' 
</p><p>Going away!&mdash;to try to forget!&mdash;no doubt, to 
succeed in forgetting!  Then this was her last chance. 
</p><p>"Must I go, Mildred?  Won't you relent?'' 
</p><p>"I don't love you&mdash;and I never can.''  She was 
deathly white and trembling.  She lifted her eyes to 
begin a retreat, for her courage had quite oozed away. 
He was looking at her, his face distorted with a mingling 
of the passion of desire and the passion of jealousy. 
She shrank, caught at the back of a chair for 
support, felt suddenly strong and defiant.  To be this 
man's plaything, to submit to his moods, to his 
jealousies, to his caprices&mdash;to be his to fumble and caress, 
his to have the fury of his passion wreak itself upon 
her with no response from her but only repulsion and 
loathing&mdash;and the long dreary hours and days and 
years alone with him, listening to his commonplaces, 
often so tedious, forced to try to amuse him and to keep 
him in a good humor because he held the purse-strings&mdash; 
</p><p>"Please go,'' she said. 
</p><p>She was still very young, still had years and years 
of youth unspent.  Surely she could find something 
better than this.  Surely life must mean something more 
than this.  At least it was worth a trial. 
</p><p>He held out his hand.  She gave him her reluctant 
and cold fingers.  He said something, what she did not 
hear, for the blood was roaring in her ears as the room 
swam round.  He was gone, and the next thing she 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0301" n="288"/>  
definitely knew she was at the threshold of Cyrilla's 
room.  Cyrilla gave her a tenderly sympathetic glance. 
She saw herself in a mirror and knew why; her face was 
gray and drawn, and her eyes lay dully deep within 
dark circles. 
</p><p>"I couldn't do it,'' she said.  "I sent for him to 
marry him.  But I couldn't.'' 
</p><p>"I'm glad,'' said Cyrilla.  "Marriage without love 
is a last resort.  And you're a long way from last resorts.'' 
</p><p>"You don't think I'm crazy?'' 
</p><p>"I think you've won a great victory.'' 
</p><p>"Victory!''  And Mildred laughed dolefully.  "If 
this is victory, I hope I'll never know defeat.'' 
</p><p>Why did Mildred refuse Stanley Baird and cut herself 
off from him, even after her hopes of Donald Keith 
died through lack of food, real or imaginary?  It 
would be gratifying to offer this as a case of pure 
courage and high principle, untainted of the motives which 
govern ordinary human actions.  But unluckily this is 
a biography, not a romance, a history and not a eulogy. 
And Mildred Gower is a human being, even as you 
and I, not a galvanized embodiment of superhuman 
virtues such as you and I are pretending to be, perhaps 
even to ourselves.  The explanation of her strange 
aberration, which will be doubted or secretly condemned 
by every woman of the sheltered classes who loves her 
dependence and seeks to disguise it as something sweet 
and fine and "womanly''&mdash;the explanation of her almost 
insane act of renunciation of all that a lady holds 
most dear is simple enough, puzzling though she found 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0302" n="289"/> 
it.  Ignorance, which accounts for so much of the 
squalid failure in human life, accounts also for much if 
not all the most splendid audacious achievement.  Very 
often&mdash;very, very often&mdash;the impossibilities are 
achieved by those who in their ignorance advance not 
boldly but unconcernedly where a wiser man or woman 
would shrink and retreat.  Fortunate indeed is he or 
she who in a crisis is by chance equipped with neither 
too little nor too much knowledge&mdash;who knows enough 
to enable him to advance, but does not know enough to 
appreciate how perilous, how foolhardy, how harsh and 
cruel, advance will be.  Mildred was in this instance thus 
fortunate&mdash;unfortunate, she was presently to think it. 
She knew enough about loveless marriage to shrink 
from it.  She did not know enough about what poverty, 
moneylessness, and friendlessness mean in the actuality 
to a woman bred as she had been.  She imagined 
she knew&mdash;and sick at heart her notion of poverty 
made her.  But imagination was only faintest 
foreshadowing of actuality.  If she had known, she would 
have yielded to the temptation that was almost too 
strong for her.  And if she had yielded&mdash;what then? 
Not such a repulsive lot, as our comfortable classes look 
at it.  Plenty to eat and drink and to wear, servants 
and equipages and fine houses and fine society, the envy 
of her gaping kind&mdash;a comfortable life for the body, 
a comfortable death for mind and heart, slowly and 
softly suffocated in luxury.  Partly through knowledge 
that strongly affected her character, which was on the 
whole aspiring and sensitive beyond the average to the 
true and the beautiful, partly through ignorance that 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0303" n="290"/> 
veiled the future from her none too valorous and hardy 
heart, she did not yield to the temptation.  And thus, 
instead of dying, she began to live, for what is life but 
growth in experience, in strength and knowledge and 
capability? 
</p><p>A baby enters the world screaming with pain.  The 
first sensations of living are agonizing.  It is the same 
with the birth of souls, for a soul is not really born 
until that day when it is offered choice between life and 
death and chooses life.  In Mildred Gower's case this 
birth was an agony.  She awoke the following morning 
with a dull headache, a fainting heart, and a throat 
so sore that she felt a painful catch whenever she tried 
to swallow.  She used the spray; she massaged her 
throat and neck vigorously.  In vain; it was folly to 
think of going where she might have to risk a trial of 
her voice that day.  The sun was brilliant and the air 
sharp without being humid or too cold.  She dressed, 
breakfasted, went out for a walk.  The throat grew 
worse, then better.  She returned for luncheon, and 
afterward began to think of packing, not that she had 
chosen a new place, but because she wished to have some 
sort of a sense of action.  But her unhappiness drove 
her out again&mdash;to the park where the air was fine 
and she could walk in comparative solitude. 
</p><p>"What a silly fool I am!'' thought she.  "Why did 
I do this in the worst, the hardest possible way?  I 
should have held on to Stanley until I had a position. 
No, I'm such a poor creature that I could never have 
done it in that way.  I'd simply have kept on bluffing, 
fooling myself, putting off and putting of.  I had to 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0304" n="291"/> 
jump into the water with nobody near to help me, or 
I'd never have begun to learn to swim.  I haven't 
begun yet.  I may never learn to swim.  I may drown. 
Yes, I probably shall drown.'' 
</p><p>She wandered aimlessly on&mdash;around the upper 
reservoir where the strong breeze freshened her through and 
through and made her feel less forlorn in spite of her 
chicken heart.  She crossed the bridge at the lower end 
and came down toward the East Drive.  A taxicab 
rushed by, not so fast, however, that she failed to 
recognize Donald Keith and Cyrilla Brindley.  They were 
talking so earnestly&mdash;Keith was talking, for a wonder, 
and Mrs. Brindley listening&mdash;that they did not 
see her.  She went straight home.  But as she was 
afoot, the journey took about half an hour.  Cyrilla 
was already there, in a neglig&eacute;e, looking as if she had 
not been out of the little library for hours.  She was 
writing a letter.  Mildred strolled in and seated herself. 
Cyrilla went on writing.  Mildred watched her 
impatiently.  She wished to talk, to be talked to, to be 
consoled and cheered, to hear about Donald Keith.  Would 
that letter never be finished?  At last it was, and 
Cyrilla took a book and settled herself to reading.  There 
was a vague something in her manner&mdash;a change, an 
attitude toward Mildred&mdash;that disturbed Mildred.  Or, 
was that notion of a change merely the offspring of her 
own somber mood?  Seeing that Mrs. Brindley would 
not begin, she broke the silence herself.  Said she awkwardly: 
</p><p>"I've decided to move.  In fact, I've got to move.'' 
</p><p>Cyrilla laid down the book and regarded her tran-
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0305" n="292"/>       
quilly.  "Of course,'' said she.  "I've already begun 
to arrange for someone else.'' 
</p><p>Mildred choked, and the tears welled into her eyes. 
She had not been mistaken; Cyrilla had changed toward 
her.  Now that she had no prospects for a brilliant 
career, now that her money was gone, Cyrilla had begun 
to&mdash;to be human.  No doubt, in the course of 
that drive, Cyrilla had discovered that Keith had no 
interest in her either.  Mildred beat down her emotion 
and was soon able to say in a voice as unconcerned as 
Cyrilla's: 
</p><p>"I'll find a place to-morrow or next day, and go at 
once.'' 
</p><p>"I'll be sorry to lose you,'' said Mrs. Brindley, "but 
I agree with you that you can't get settled any too 
soon.'' 
</p><p>"You don't happen to know of any cheap, good 
place?'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"If it's cheap, I don't think it's likely to be good&mdash; 
in New York,'' replied Cyrilla.  "You'll have to put 
up with inconveniences&mdash;and worse.  I'd offer to help 
you find a place, but I think everything self-reliant one 
does helps one to learn.  Don't you?'' 
</p><p>"Yes, indeed,'' assented Mildred.  The thing was 
self-evidently true; still she began to hate Cyrilla. 
This cold-hearted New York!  How she would grind 
down her heel when she got it on the neck of New York! 
Friendship, love, helpfulness&mdash;what did New York and 
New-Yorkers know of these things?  "Or Hanging 
Rock, either,'' reflected she.  What a cold and lonely 
world! 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0306" n="293"/> 
</p><p>"Have you been to see about a position?'' inquired 
Cyrilla. 
</p><p>Mildred was thrown into confusion.  "I can't go&mdash; 
for a&mdash;day or so,'' she stammered.  "The changeable 
weather has rather upset my throat.  Nothing serious, 
but I want to be at my best.'' 
</p><p>"Certainly,'' said Mrs. Brindley.  Her direct gaze 
made Mildred uncomfortable.  She went on:  "You're 
sure it's the weather?'' 
</p><p>"What else could it be?'' demanded Mildred with a 
latent resentment whose interesting origin she did not 
pause to inquire into. 
</p><p>"Well, salad, or sauces, or desserts, or <hi rend="italic">caf&eacute; au lait</hi> in 
the morning, or candy, or tea,'' said Cyrilla.  "Or it 
might be cigarettes, or all those things&mdash;and thin 
stockings and low shoes&mdash;mightn't it?'' 
</p><p>Never before had she known Cyrilla to say anything 
meddlesome or cattish.  Said Mildred with a faint sneer, 
"That sounds like Mr. Keith's crankiness.'' 
</p><p>"It is,'' replied Cyrilla.  "I used to think he was a 
crank on the subject of singing and stomachs, and singing 
and ankles.  But I've been convinced, partly by 
him, mostly by what I've observed.'' 
</p><p>Mildred maintained an icy silence. 
</p><p>"I see you are resenting what I said,'' observed 
Cyrilla. 
</p><p>"Not at all,'' said Mildred.  "No doubt you meant 
well.'' 
</p><p>"You will please remember that you asked me a question.'' 
</p><p>So she had.  But the discovery that she was clearly 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0307" n="294"/> 
in the wrong, that she had invited the disguised lecture, 
only aggravated her sense of resentment against Mrs. 
Brindley.  She spent the rest of the afternoon in sorting 
and packing her belongings&mdash;and in crying.  She 
came upon the paper Donald Keith had left.  She read 
it through carefully, thoughtfully, read it to the last 
direction as to exercise with the machine, the last 
arrangement for a daily routine of life, the last suggestion 
as to diet. 
</p><p>"Fortunately all that isn't necessary,'' said she to 
herself, when she had finished.  "If it were, I could 
never make a career.  I'm not stupid enough to be able 
to lead that kind of life.  Why, I'd not care to make a 
career, at that price.  Slavery&mdash;plain slavery.'' 
</p><p>When she went in to dinner, she saw instantly that 
Cyrilla too had been crying.  Cyrilla did not look old, 
anything but that, indeed was not old and would not 
begin to be for many a year.  Still, after thirty-five 
or forty a woman cannot indulge a good cry without 
its leaving serious traces that will show hours afterward. 
At sight of the evidences of Cyrilla's grief Mildred 
straightway forgot her resentment.  There must have 
been some other cause for Cyrilla's peculiar conduct. 
No matter what, since it was not hardness of heart. 
</p><p>It was a sad, even a gloomy dinner.  But the two 
women were once more in perfect sympathy.  And 
afterward Mildred brought the Keith paper and asked 
Cyrilla's opinion.  Cyrilla read slowly and without 
comment.  At last she said: 
</p><p>"He got this from his mother, Lucia Rivi.  Have 
you read her life?'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0308" n="295"/>
</p><p>"No.  I've heard almost nothing about her, except 
that she was famous.'' 
</p><p>"She was more than that,'' said Mrs. Brindley. 
"She was great, a great personality.  She was an 
almost sickly child and girl.  Her first attempts on the 
stage were humiliating failures.  She had no health, no 
endurance, nothing but a small voice of rare quality.'' 
Cyrilla held up the paper.  "This tells how she became 
one of the surest and most powerful dramatic sopranos 
that ever lived.'' 
</p><p>"She must have been a dull person to have been able 
to lead the kind of life that's described there,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"Only two kinds of persons could do it,'' replied 
Cyrilla&mdash;"a dull person&mdash;a plodder&mdash;and a genius. 
Middling people&mdash;they're the kind that fill the world, 
they're you and I, my dear&mdash;middling people have to 
fuss with the trifles that must be sacrificed if one is to 
do anything big.  You call those trifles your freedom, 
but they're your slavery.  And by sacrificing them the 
Lucia Rivis buy their freedom.''  Cyrilla looked at the 
paper with a heavy sigh.  "Ah, I wish I had seen this 
when I was your age.  Now, it's too late.'' 
</p><p>Said Mildred:  "Would you seriously advise me to 
try that?'' 
</p><p>Cyrilla came and sat beside her and put an arm 
around her.  "Mildred,'' she said, "I've never thrust 
advice on you.  I only dare do it now because you ask 
me, and because I love you.  You must try it.  It's 
your one chance.  If you do not, you will fail.  You 
don't believe me?'' 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0309" n="296"/> 
</p><p>In a tone that was admission, Mildred said:  "I 
don't know.'' 
</p><p>"Keith has given you there the secret of a successful 
career.  You'll never read it in any book, or get it 
from any teacher, or from any singer or manager or 
doctor.  You must live like that, you must do those 
things or you will fail even in musical comedy.  You 
would fail even as an actress, if you tried that, when 
you found out that the singing was out of the question.'' 
</p><p>Mildred was impressed.  Perhaps she would have 
been more impressed had she not seen Keith and Mrs. 
Brindley in the taxi, Keith talking earnestly and Mrs. 
Brindley listening as if to an oracle.  Said she: 
"Perhaps I'll adopt some of the suggestions.'' 
</p><p>Cyrilla shook her head.  "It's a route to success. 
You must go the whole route or not at all.'' 
</p><p>"Don't forget that there have been other singers 
besides Rivi.'' 
</p><p>"Not any that I recall who weren't naturally powerful 
in every way.  And how many of them break down? 
Mildred, please do put the silly nonsense about nerves 
and temperament and inspiration and overwork and 
weather and climate&mdash;put all that out of your head. 
Build your temple of a career as high and graceful 
and delicate as you like, but build it on the coarse, hard, 
solid rock, dear!'' 
</p><p>Mildred tried to laugh lightly.  "How Mr. Keith 
does hypnotize people!'' cried she. 
</p><p>Mrs. Brindley's cheeks burned, and her eyes lowered 
in acute embarrassment.  "He has a way of being 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0310" n="297"/>  
splendidly and sensibly right,'' said she.  "And the 
truth is wonderfully convincing&mdash;once one sees it.'' 
She changed the subject, and it did not come up&mdash;or, 
perhaps, come <hi rend="italic">out</hi> again&mdash;before they went to bed. 
The next day Mildred began the depressing, hopeless 
search for a place to live that would be clean, 
comfortable, and cheap.  Those three adjectives describe 
the ideal lodging; but it will be noted that all these are 
relative.  In fact, none of the three means exactly the 
same thing to any two members of the human family. 
Mildred's notion of clean&mdash;like her notion of 
comfortable&mdash;on account of her bringing up implied a 
large element of luxury.  As for the word "cheap,'' it 
really meant nothing at all to her.  From one stand-point everything seemed cheap; from another, everything 
seemed dear; that is, too dear for a young woman 
with less than five hundred dollars in the world and no 
substantial prospect of getting a single dollar more&mdash; 
unless by hook and crook, both of which means she was 
resolved not to employ. 
</p><p>Never having earned so much as a single penny, the 
idea of anyone's giving her anything for what she 
might be able to do was disturbingly vague and unreal. 
On the other hand, looking about her, she saw scores 
of men and women, personally known to her to be dull 
of conversation, and not well mannered or well dressed 
or well anything, who were making livings without 
overwhelming difficulty.  Why not Mildred Gower?  In 
this view the outlook was not discouraging.  "I'll no 
doubt go through some discomfort, getting myself 
placed.  But somewhere and somehow I shall be placed 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0311" n="298"/> 
&mdash;and how I shall revenge myself on Donald Keith!'' 
His fascination for her had not been destroyed by his 
humiliating lack of belief in her, nor by his cold-hearted 
desertion at just the critical moment.  But his conduct 
had given her the incentive of rage, of stung vanity&mdash; 
or wounded pride, if you prefer.  She would get him 
back; she would force him to admit; she would win him, 
if she could&mdash;and that ought not to be difficult when 
she should be successful.  Having won him, then&mdash; 
What then?  Something superb in the way of revenge; 
she would decide what, when the hour of triumph came. 
Meanwhile she must search for lodgings. 
</p><p>In her journeyings under the guidance of attractive 
advertisements and "carefully selected'' agents' lists, 
she found herself in front of her first lodgings in New 
York&mdash;the house of Mrs. Belloc.  She had often 
thought of the New England school-teacher, arrived by 
such strange paths at such a strange position in New 
York.  She had started to call on her many times, but 
each time had been turned aside; New York makes it 
more than difficult to find time to do anything that does 
not have to be done at a definite time and for a definite 
reason.  She was worn out with her futile trampings 
up and down streets, up and down stairs.  Up the stone 
steps she went and rang the bell. 
</p><p>Yes, Mrs. Belloc was in, and would be glad to see 
her, if Miss Stevens would wait in the drawing-room 
a few minutes.  She had not seated herself when down 
the stairs came the fresh, pleasantly countrified voice 
of Mrs. Belloc, inviting her to ascend.  As Mildred 
started up, she saw at the head of the stairs the frank 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0312" n="299"/> 
and cheerful face of the lady herself.  She was holding 
together at the neck a thin silk wrapper whose lines 
strongly suggested that it was the only garment she 
had on. 
</p><p>"Why should old friends stand on ceremony?'' said 
Mrs. Belloc.  "Come right up.  I've been taking a 
bath.  My masseuse has just gone.''  Mrs. Belloc 
enclosed her in a delightfully perfumed embrace, and they 
kissed with enthusiasm. 
</p><p>"I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> glad to see you,'' said Mildred, 
feeling all at 
once a thrilling sense of at-homeness.  "I didn't realize 
how glad I'd be till I saw you.'' 
</p><p>"It'd be a pretty stiff sort that wouldn't feel at home 
with me,'' observed Mrs. Belloc.  "New York usually 
stiffens people up.  It's had the opposite effect on me. 
Though I must say, I have learned to stiffen with people 
I don't like&mdash;and I'll have to admit that I like fewer 
and fewer.  People don't wear well, do they?  What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> 
the matter with them?  Why can't they be natural and 
not make themselves into rubbishy, old scrap-bags full 
of fakes and pretenses?  You're looking at my hair.'' 
</p><p>They were in Mrs. Belloc's comfortable sitting-room 
now, and she was smoking a cigarette and regarding 
Mildred with an expression of delight that was most 
flattering.  Said Mildred: 
</p><p>"Your hair does look well.  It's thicker&mdash;isn't it?'' 
</p><p>"Think so?'' said Mrs. Belloc.  "It ought to be, 
with all the time and money I've spent on it.  My, how 
New York does set a woman to repairing and fixing up. 
Nothing artificial goes here.  It mustn't be paint and 
plumpers and pads, but the real teeth.  Why, I've had 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0313" n="300"/> 
four real teeth set in as if they were rooted&mdash;and my 
hips toned down.  You may remember what heavy legs 
I had&mdash;piano-legs.  Look at 'em now.''  Mrs. Belloc 
drew the wrapper to her knee and exposed in a pale-blue silk stocking a thin and comely calf. 
</p><p>"You <hi rend="italic">have</hi> been busy!'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"That's only a little part.  I started to tell you about 
the hair.  It was getting gray&mdash;not in a nice, pretty 
way, all over, but in spots and streaks.  Nothing else 
makes a woman look so ragged and dingy and old as 
spotted, streaky gray hair.  So I had the hair-woman 
touch it up.  She vows it won't make my face hard. 
That's the trouble with dyed or touched hair, you know. 
But this is a new process.'' 
</p><p>"It's certainly a success,'' said Mildred.  And in fact 
it was, and thanks to it and the other improvements Mrs. 
Belloc was an attractive and even a pretty woman, years 
younger than when Mildred saw her. 
</p><p>"Yes, I think I've improved,'' said Mrs. Belloc. 
"Nothing to scream about&mdash;but worth while.  That's 
what we're alive for&mdash;to improve&mdash;isn't it?  I've no 
patience with people who slide back, or don't get on&mdash; 
people who get less and less as they grow older.  The 
trouble with them is they're vain, satisfied with 
themselves as they are, and lazy.  Most women are too lazy 
to live.  They'll only fix up to catch a man.'' 
</p><p>Mildred had grown sober and thoughtful. 
</p><p>"To catch a man,'' continued Mrs. Belloc.  "And 
not much even for that.  I'll warrant <hi rend="italic">you're</hi> 
getting on. 
Tell me about it.'' 
</p><p>"Tell me about yourself, first,'' said Mildred. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0314" n="301"/> 
</p><p>"<hi rend="italic">Why</hi> all this excitement about improving?''  
And 
she smiled significantly. 
</p><p>"No, you'll have to guess again,'' said Mrs. Belloc. 
"Not a man.  You remember, I used to be crazy about 
gay life in New York&mdash;going out, and men, theaters, 
and lobster-palaces&mdash;everything I didn't get in my 
home town, everything the city means to the jays. 
Well, I've gotten over all that.  I'm improving, mind 
and body, just to keep myself interested in life, to keep 
myself young and cheerful.  I'm interested in myself, 
in my house and in woman's suffrage.  Not that the 
women are fit to vote.  They aren't, any more than the 
men.  But what <hi rend="italic">makes</hi> people?  Why, responsibility. 
That old scamp I married&mdash;he's dead.  And I've got 
the money, and everything's very comfortable with me. 
Just think, I didn't have any luck till I was an old maid 
far gone.  I'm not telling my age.  All my life it 
had rained bad luck&mdash;pitchforks, tines down.  And 
why?'' 
</p><p>"Yes, why?'' said Mildred.  She did not understand 
how it was, but Mrs. Belloc seemed to be saying the 
exact things she needed to hear. 
</p><p>"I'll tell you why.  Because I didn't work.  Drudging 
along isn't work any more than dawdling along. 
Work means purpose, means head.  And my luck began 
just as anybody's does&mdash;when I rose up and got 
busy.  You may say it wasn't very creditable, the way 
I began; but it was the best <hi rend="italic">I</hi> could do.  I know it 
isn't 
good morals, but I'm willing to bet that many a man 
has laid the foundations of a big fine career by doing 
something that wasn't at all nice or right.  He had to 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0315" n="302"/>  
do it, to `get through.'  If he hadn't done it, he'd never 
have `got through.'  Anyhow, whether that's so or not, 
everyone's got to make a fight to break into the part of 
the world where living's really worth living.  But I 
needn't tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi> that.  You're doing it.'' 
</p><p>"No, I'm not,'' replied Mildred.  "I'm ashamed to 
say so, but I'm not.  I've been bluffing&mdash;and wasting 
time.'' 
</p><p>"That's bad, that's bad,'' said Mrs. Belloc. 
"Especially, as you've got it in you to get there.  What's 
been the trouble?  The wrong kind of associations?'' 
</p><p>"Partly,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>Mrs. Belloc, watching her interestedly, suddenly 
lighted up.  "Why not come back here to live?'' said 
she.  "Now, please don't refuse till I explain.  You 
remember what kind of people I had here?'' 
</p><p>Mildred smiled.  "Rather&mdash;unconventional?'' 
</p><p>"That's polite.  Well, I've cleared 'em out.  Not 
that I minded their unconventionality; I liked it.  It 
was so different from the straight-jackets and the 
hypocrisy I'd been living among and hating.  But I soon 
found out that&mdash;well, Miss Stevens, the average human 
being ought to be pretty conventional in his morals 
of a certain kind.  If he&mdash;or <hi rend="italic">she</hi>&mdash;isn't, they 
begin 
to get unconventional in every way&mdash;about paying 
their bills, for instance, and about drinking.  I got sick 
and tired of those people.  So, I put 'em all out&mdash;made 
a sweep.  And now I've become quite as respectable as 
I care to be&mdash;or as is necessary.  The couples in the 
house are married, and they're nice people of good 
families.  It was Mrs. Dyckman&mdash;she's got the whole sec-
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0316" n="303"/> 
ond floor front, she and her husband and the daughter 
&mdash;it was Mrs. Dyckman who interested me in the 
suffrage movement.  You must hear her speak.  And the 
daughter does well at it, too&mdash;and keeps a fashionable 
millinery-shop&mdash;and she's only twenty-four.  Then 
there's Nora Blond.'' 
</p><p>"The actress?'' 
</p><p>"The actress.  She's the quietest, hardest-working 
person here.  She's got the whole first floor front. 
Nobody ever comes to see her, except on Sunday afternoon. 
She leads the queerest life.'' 
</p><p>"Tell me about that,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"I don't know much about it,'' confessed Mrs. 
Belloc.  "She's regular as a clock&mdash;does everything on 
time, and at the same time.  Two meals a day&mdash;one 
of them a dry little breakfast she gets herself.  Walks, 
fencing, athletics, study.'' 
</p><p>"What slavery!'' 
</p><p>"She's the happiest person I ever saw,'' retorted Mrs. 
Belloc.  "Why, she's got her work, her career.  You 
don't look at it right, Miss Stevens.  You don't look 
happy.  What's the matter?  Isn't it because you 
haven't been working right&mdash;because you've been doing 
these alleged pleasant things that leave a bad taste 
in your mouth and weaken you? I'll bet, if you had 
been working hard, you'd not be unhappy now.  Better 
come here to live.'' 
</p><p>"Will you let me tell you about myself?'' 
</p><p>"Go right ahead.  May I ask questions, where I 
want to know more?  I do hate to get things halfway.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0317" n="304"/>  
</p><p>Mildred freely gave her leave, then proceeded to tell 
her whole story, omitting nothing that was essential to 
an understanding.  In conclusion she said:  "I'd like 
to come.  You see, I've very little money.  When it's 
gone, I'll go, unless I make some more.'' 
</p><p>"Yes, you must come.  That Mrs. Brindley seems 
to be a nice woman, a mighty nice woman.  But her 
house, and the people that come there&mdash;they aren't the 
right sort for a girl that's making a start.  I can give 
you a room on the top floor&mdash;in front.  The young 
lady next to you is a clerk in an architect's office, and 
a fine girl she is.'' 
</p><p>"How much does she pay?'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"Your room won't be quite as nice as hers.  I put 
you at the top because you can sing up there, part of 
the mornings and part of the afternoons, without 
disturbing anybody.  I don't have a general table any 
more.  You can take your meals in your room or at the 
restaurant in the apartment-house next door.  It's good 
and quite reasonable.'' 
</p><p>"How much for the room?'' persisted Mildred, 
laughing. 
</p><p>"Seven dollars a week, and the use of the bath.'' 
</p><p>Mildred finally wrung from her that the right price 
was twelve dollars a week, and insisted on paying that 
&mdash;"until my money gets low.'' 
</p><p>"Don't worry about that,'' said Mrs. Belloc. 
</p><p>"You mustn't weaken me,'' cried Mildred.  "You 
mustn't encourage me to be a coward and to shirk. 
That's why I'm coming here.'' 
</p><p>"I understand,'' said Mrs. Belloc.  "I've got the 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0318" n="305"/> 
New England streak of hardness in me, though I 
believe that masseuse has almost ironed it out of my face. 
Do I look like a New England schoolmarm?'' 
</p><p>Mildred could truthfully answer that there wasn't a 
trace of it. 
</p><p>When she returned to Mrs. Brindley's&mdash;already she 
had ceased to think of it as home&mdash;she announced her 
new plans.  Mrs. Brindley said nothing, but Mildred 
understood the quick tightening of the lines round her 
mouth and the shifting of the eyes.  She hastened to 
explain that Mrs. Belloc was no longer the sort of 
woman or the sort of landlady she had been a few 
months before.  Mrs. Brindley of the older New York, 
could neither understand nor believe in the people of 
the new and real New York whom it molds for better 
or for worse so rapidly&mdash;and even remolds again and 
again.  But Mildred was able to satisfy her that the 
house was at least not suspicious. 
</p><p>"It doesn't matter where you're going,'' said Mrs. 
Brindley.  "It's that you are going.  I can't bear 
giving you up.  I had hoped that our lives would flow on 
and on together.''  She was with difficulty controlling 
her emotions.  "It's these separations that age one, 
that take one's life.  I almost wish I hadn't met you.'' 
</p><p>Mildred was moved, herself.  Not so much as Mrs. 
Brindley because she had the necessities of her career 
gripping her and claiming the strongest feelings there 
were in her.  Also, she was much the younger, not 
merely in years but in experience.  And separations 
have no real poignancy in them for youth 
</p><p>"Yes, I know you love me,'' said Cyrilla, "but love 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0319" n="306"/> 
doesn't mean to you what it means to me.  I'm in that 
middle period of life where everything has its fullest 
meaning.  In youth we're easily consoled and distracted 
because life seems so full of possibilities, and we can't 
believe friendship and love are rare, and still more rarely 
worth while.  In old age, when the arteries harden and 
the blood flows slow and cold, we become indifferent. 
But between thirty-five and fifty-five how the heart can 
ache!''  She smiled, with trembling lips.  "And how it 
can rejoice!'' she cried bravely.  "I must not forget 
to mention that.  Ah, my dear, you must learn to live 
intensely.  If I had had your chance!'' 
</p><p>"Ridiculous!'' laughed Mildred.  "You talk like an 
old woman.  And I never think of you as older than 
myself.'' 
</p><p>"I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> an old woman,'' said Cyrilla.  And, 
with a 
tightening at the heart Mildred saw, deep in the depths 
of her eyes, the look of old age.  "I've found that I'm 
too old for love&mdash;for man-and-woman love&mdash;and that 
means I'm an old woman.'' 
</p><p>Mildred felt that there was only a thin barrier of 
reserve between her and some sad secret of this strange, 
shy, loving woman's&mdash;a barrier so thin that she could 
almost hear the stifled moan of a broken heart.  But 
the barrier remained; it would have been impossible for 
Cyrilla Brindley to talk frankly about herself. 
</p><p>When Mildred came out of her room the next morning, 
Cyrilla had gone, leaving a note: 
 
</p><p>I can't bear good-bys.  Besides, we'll see each other very 
soon.  Forgive me for shrinking, but really I can't. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0320" n="307"/>  
 
</p><p>Before night Mildred was settled in the new place and 
the new room, with no sense of strangeness.  She was 
reproaching herself for hardness, for not caring about 
Cyrilla, the best and truest friend she had ever had. 
But the truth lay in quite a different direction.  The 
house, the surroundings, where she had lived luxuriously, 
dreaming her foolish and fatuous dreams, was 
not the place for such a struggle as was now upon her. 
And for that struggle she preferred, to sensitive, sober, 
refined, impractical Cyrilla Brindley, the companionship 
and the sympathy, the practical sympathy, of Agnes 
Belloc.  No one need be ashamed or nervous before 
Agnes Belloc about being poor or unsuccessful or having 
to resort to shabby makeshifts or having to endure 
coarse contacts.  Cyrilla represented refinement, 
appreciation of the finished work&mdash;luxurious and sterile 
appreciation and enjoyment.  Agnes represented the 
workshop&mdash;where all the doers of all that is done live 
and work.  Mildred was descending from the heights 
where live those who have graduated from the lot of the 
human race and have lost all that superficial or casual 
resemblance to that race.  She was going down to live 
with the race, to share in its lot.  She was glad Agnes 
Belloc was to be there. 
</p><p>Generalizing about such a haphazard conglomerate 
as human nature is highly unsatisfactory, but it may 
be cautiously ventured that in New England, as in old 
England, there is a curiously contradictory way of 
dealing with conventionality.  Nowhere is conventionality 
more in reverence; yet when a New-Englander, man or 
woman, happens to elect to break with it, nowhere is 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0321" n="308"/>  
the break so utter and so defiant.  If Agnes Belloc, 
cut loose from the conventions that had bound her from 
childhood to well into middle life, had remained at home, 
no doubt she would have spent a large part of her nights 
in thinking out ways of employing her days in outraging 
the conventionalities before her horrified and 
infuriated neighbors.  But of what use in New York to 
cuff and spit upon deities revered by only an insignificant 
class&mdash;and only officially revered by that class? 
Agnes had soon seen that there was no amusement or 
interest whatever in an enterprise which in her New 
England home would have filled her life to the brim with 
excitement.  Also, she saw that she was well into that 
time of life where the absence of reputation in a woman 
endangers her comfort, makes her liable to be left alone 
&mdash;not despised and denounced, but simply avoided and 
ignored.  So she was telling Mildred the exact truth. 
She had laid down the arms she had taken up against 
the social system, and had come in&mdash;and was fighting 
it from the safer and wiser inside.  She still insisted 
that a woman had the same rights as a man; but she took 
care to make it clear that she claimed those rights only 
for others, that she neither exercised them nor cared for 
them for herself.  And to make her propaganda the 
more effective, she was not only circumspect herself, 
but was exceedingly careful to be surrounded by 
circumspect people.  No one could cite her case as proof 
that woman would expand liberty into license.  In 
theory there was nothing lively that she did not look 
upon at least with tolerance; in practice, more and more 
she disliked seeing one of her sex do anything that might 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0322" n="309"/>
cause the world to say "woman would abuse liberty if 
she had it.''  "Sensible people,'' she now said, "do as 
they like.  But they don't give fools a chance to titter 
and chatter.'' 
</p><p>Agnes Belloc was typical&mdash;certainly of a large and 
growing class in this day&mdash;of the decay of ancient temples 
and the decline of the old-fashioned idealism that 
made men fancy they lived nobly because they professed 
and believed nobly.  She had no ethical standards.  She 
simply met each situation as it arose and dealt with it 
as common sense seemed in that particular instance to 
dictate.  For a thousand years genius has been striving 
with the human race to induce it to abandon its 
superstitions and hypocrisies and to defy common sense, so 
adaptable, so tolerant, so conducive to long and healthy 
and happy life.  Grossly materialistic, but alluringly 
comfortable.  Whether for good or for evil or for both 
good and evil, the geniuses seem in a fair way at last 
to prevail over the idealists, religious and political. 
And Mrs. Belloc, without in the least realizing it, was 
a most significant sign of the times. 
</p><p>"Your throat seems to be better to-day,'' said she to 
Mildred at breakfast.  "Those simple house-remedies 
I tried on you last night seem to have done some good. 
Nothing like heat&mdash;hot water&mdash;and no eating.  The 
main thing was doing without dinner last night.'' 
</p><p>"My nerves are quieter,'' advanced Mildred as the 
likelier explanation of the return of the soul of music to 
its seat.  "And my mind's at rest.'' 
</p><p>"Yes, that's good,'' said plain Agnes Belloc.  "But 
getting the stomach straight and keeping it straight's 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0323" n="310"/> 
the main thing.  My old grandmother could eat anything 
and do anything.  I've seen her put in a glass of 
milk or a saucer of ice-cream on top of a tomato-salad. 
The way she kept well was, whenever she began to feel 
the least bit off, she stopped eating.  Not a bite would 
she touch till she felt well again.'' 
</p><p>Mildred, moved by an impulse stronger than her 
inclination, produced the Keith paper.  "I wish you'd 
read this, and tell me what you think of it.  You've 
got so much common sense.'' 
</p><p>Agnes read it through to the end, began at the 
beginning and read it through again.  "That sounds 
good to me,'' said she.  "I want to think it over.  If 
you don't mind I'd like to show it to Miss Blond.  She 
knows a lot about those things.  I suppose you're going 
to see Mr. Crossley to-day?&mdash;that's the musical 
manager's name, isn't it?'' 
</p><p>"I'm going at eleven.  That isn't too early, is it?'' 
</p><p>"If I were you, I'd go as soon as I was dressed for 
the street.  And if you don't get to see him, wait till 
you do.  Don't talk to under-staffers.  Always go 
straight for the head man.  You've got something that's 
worth his while.  How did he get to be head man? 
Because he knows a good thing the minute he sees it.  The 
under fellows are usually under because they are so 
taken up with themselves and with impressing people 
how grand they are that they don't see anything else. 
So, when you talk to them, you wear yourself out and 
waste your time.'' 
</p><p>"There's only one thing that makes me nervous,'' 
said Mildred.  "Everyone I've ever talked with about 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0324" n="311"/>  
going on the stage&mdash;everyone who has talked candidly 
&mdash;has said&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"Yes, I know,'' said Mrs. Belloc, as Mildred paused 
to search for smooth-sounding words in which to dress, 
without disguising, a distinctly ugly idea.  "I've heard 
that, too.  I don't know whether there's anything in it 
or not.''  She looked admiringly at Mildred, who that 
morning was certainly lovely enough to tempt any man. 
"If there is anything in it, why, I reckon <hi rend="italic">you'd</hi> 
be up 
against it.  That's the worst of having men at the top 
in any trade and profession.  A woman's got to get 
her chance through some man, and if he don't choose 
to let her have it, she's likely to fail.'' 
</p><p>Mildred showed how this depressed her. 
</p><p>"But don't you fret about that till you have to,'' 
advised Mrs. Belloc.  "I've a notion that, even if it's 
true, it may not apply to you.  Where a woman offers 
for a place that she can fill about as well as a hundred 
other women, she's at the man's mercy; but if she knows 
that she's far and away the best for the place, I don't 
think a man's going to stand in his own light.  Let him 
see that he can make money through <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, money he 
won't make if he don't get you.  Then, I don't think 
you'll have any trouble.'' 
</p><p>But Mildred's depression did not decrease.  "If my 
voice could only be relied on!'' she exclaimed.  "Isn't 
it exasperating that I've got a delicate throat!'' 
</p><p>"It's always something,'' said Mrs. Belloc.  "One 
thing's about as bad as another, and anything can be 
overcome.'' 
</p><p>"No, not in my case,'' said Mildred.  "The peculiar 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0325" n="312"/>  
quality of my voice&mdash;what makes it unusual&mdash;is due 
to the delicateness of my throat.'' 
</p><p>"Maybe so,'' said Mrs. Belloc. 
</p><p>"Of course, I can always sing&mdash;after a fashion,'' 
continued Mildred.  "But to be really valuable on the 
stage you've got to be able always to sing at your best. 
So I'm afraid I'm in the class of those who'll suit, one 
about as well as another.'' 
</p><p>"You've got to get out of that class,'' said Mrs. 
Belloc.  "The men in that class, and the women, have 
to do any dirty work the boss sees fit to give 'em&mdash;and 
not much pay, either.  Let me tell you one thing, Miss 
Stevens.  If you can't get among the few at the top 
in the singing game, you must look round for some game 
where you can hope to be among the few.  No matter 
<hi rend="italic">what</hi> it is.  By using your brains and working hard, 
there's something you can do better than pretty nearly 
anybody else can or will do it.  You find that.'' 
</p><p>The words sank in, sank deep.  Mildred, sense of her 
surroundings lost, was gazing straight ahead with an 
expression that gave Mrs. Belloc hope and even a 
certain amount of confidence.  There was a distinct 
advance; for, after she reflected upon all that Mildred had 
told her, little of her former opinion of Mildred's 
chances for success had remained but a hope detained 
not without difficulty.  Mrs. Belloc knew the human 
race unusually well for a woman&mdash;unusually well for 
a human being of whatever sex or experience.  She had 
discovered how rare is the temperament, the combination 
of intelligence and tenacity, that makes for success. 
She had learned that most people, judged by any stand-
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0326" n="313"/>     
ard, were almost total failures, that most of the more 
or less successful were so merely because the world had 
an enormous amount of important work to be done, 
even though half-way, and had no one but those half-competents to do it.  As incompetence in a man would 
be tolerated where it would not be in a woman, obviously 
a woman, to get on, must have the real temperament 
of success. 
</p><p>She now knew enough about Mildred to be able to 
"place'' her in the "lady'' class&mdash;those brought up 
not only knowing how to do nothing with a money 
value (except lawful or unlawful man-trapping), but 
also trained to a sensitiveness and refinement and false 
shame about work that made it exceedingly difficult if 
not impossible for them to learn usefulness.  She knew 
all Mildred's handicaps, both those the girl was 
conscious of and those far heavier ones which she 
fatuously regarded as advantages.  How was Mildred ever 
to learn to dismiss and disregard herself as the pretty 
woman of good social position, an object of admiration 
and consideration?  Mildred, in the bottom of her heart, 
was regarding herself as already successful&mdash;successful 
at the highest a woman can achieve or ought to 
aspire to achieve&mdash;was regarding her career, however 
she might talk or might fancy she believed, as a mere 
livelihood, a side issue.  She would be perhaps more 
than a little ashamed of her stage connections, should 
she make any, until she should be at the very top&mdash; 
and how get to the top when one is working under the 
handicap of shame?  Above all, how was this indulgently 
and shelteredly reared lady to become a work-
    <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0327" n="314"/>   
ing woman, living a routine life, toiling away day in 
and day out, with no let up, permitting no one and 
nothing to break her routine?  "Really,'' thought 
Agnes Belloc, "she ought to have married that Baird 
man&mdash;or stayed on with the nasty general.  I wonder 
why she didn't!  That's the only thing that gives me 
hope.  There must be something in her&mdash;something 
that don't appear&mdash;something she doesn't know about, 
herself.  What is it?  Maybe it was only vanity and 
vacillation.  Again, I don't know.'' 
</p><p>The difficulty Mrs. Belloc labored under in her 
attempt to explore and map Mildred Gower was a difficulty 
we all labor under in those same enterprises.  We 
cannot convince ourselves&mdash;in spite of experience 
after experience&mdash;that a human character is never 
consistent and homogeneous, is always conglomerate, 
that there are no two traits, however naturally exclusive, 
which cannot coexist in the same personality, that 
circumstance is the dominating factor in human action 
and brings forward as dominant characteristics now 
one trait or set of traits, consistent or inconsistent, and 
now another.  The Alexander who was Aristotle's model 
pupil was the same Alexander as the drunken debaucher. 
Indeed, may it not be that the characters which play 
the large parts in the comedy of life are naturally those 
that offer to the shifting winds of circumstances the 
greatest variety of strongly developed and contradictory 
qualities?  For example, if it was Mildred's latent 
courage rescued her from Siddall, was it not her strong 
tendency to vacillation that saved her from a loveless 
and mercenary marriage to Stanley Baird?  Perhaps 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0328" n="315"/>  
the deep underlying truth is that all unusual people 
have in common the character that centers a powerful 
aversion to stagnation; thus, now by their strong 
qualities, now by their weaknesses, they are swept inevitably 
on and on and ever on.  Good to-day, bad to-morrow, 
good again the day after, weak in this instance, strong 
in that, now brave and now cowardly, soft at one time, 
hard at another, generous and the reverse by turns, they 
are consistent only in that they are never at rest, but 
incessantly and inevitably go. 
</p><p>Mildred reluctantly rose, moved toward the door with 
lingering step.  "I guess I'd better make a start,'' 
said she. 
</p><p>"That's the talk,'' said Mrs. Belloc heartily.  But 
the affectionate glance she sent after the girl was dubious&mdash; 
even pitying. </p>

<p>TWO minutes' walk through to Broadway, and she 
was at her destination.  There, on the other side of the 
way, stood the Gayety Theater, with the offices of Mr. 
Clarence Crossley overlooking the intersection of the 
two streets.  Crossley was intrenched in the remotest 
of a series of rooms, each tenanted by under-staffers 
of diminishing importance as you drew way from the 
great man.  It was next to impossible to get at him&mdash; 
a cause of much sneering and dissatisfaction in theatrical 
circles.  Crossley, they said, was exclusive, had 
the swollen head, had forgotten that only a few years 
before he had been a cheap little ticket-seller grateful 
for a bow from any actor who had ever had his name 
up.  Crossley insisted that he was not a victim of <hi rend="italic">folie 
de grandeur</hi>, that, on the contrary, he had become less 
vain as he had risen, where he could see how trivial a 
thing rising was and how accidental.  Said he: 
</p><p>"Why do I shut myself in?  Because I'm what I am 
&mdash;a good thing, easy fruit.  You say that men a hundred 
times bigger than I'll ever be don't shut themselves 
up.  You say that Mountain, the biggest financier in 
the country, sits right out where anybody can go up to 
him.  Yes, but who'd dare go up to him?  It's generally 
known that he's a cannibal, that he kills his own 
food and eats it warm and raw.  So he can afford to sit 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0330" n="317"/> 
in the open.  If I did that, all my time and all my 
money would go to the cheap-skates with hard-luck 
tales.  I don't hide because I'm haughty, but because 
I'm weak and soft.'' 
</p><p>In appearance Mr. Crossley did not suggest his name. 
He was a tallish, powerful-looking person with a 
smooth, handsome, audacious face, with fine, laughing, 
but somehow untrustworthy eyes&mdash;at least untrustworthy 
for women, though women had never profited by 
the warning.  He dressed in excellent taste, almost 
conspicuously, and the gay and expensive details of his 
toilet suggested a man given over to liveliness.  As a 
matter of fact, this liveliness was potential rather than 
actual.  Mr. Crossley was always intending to resume 
the giddy ways of the years before he became a great 
man, but was always so far behind in the important 
things to be done and done at once that he was forced 
to put off.  However, his neckties and his shirts and his 
flirtations, untrustworthy eyes kept him a reputation for 
being one of the worst cases in Broadway.  In vain did 
his achievements show that he could not possibly have 
time or strength for anything but work.  He looked 
like a rounder; he was in a business that gave endless 
dazzling opportunities for the lively life; a rounder he 
was, therefore. 
</p><p>He was about forty.  At first glance, so vivid and 
energetic was he, he looked like thirty-five, but at second 
glance one saw the lines, the underlying melancholy signs 
of strain, the heavy price he had paid for phenomenal 
success won by a series of the sort of risks that make the 
hair fall as autumn leaves on a windy day and make 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0331" n="318"/>  
such hairs as stick turn rapidly gray.  Thus, there 
were many who thought Crossley was through vanity 
shy of the truth by five or six years when he said forty. 
</p><p>In ordinary circumstances Mildred would never have 
got at Crossley.  This was the first business call of her 
life where she had come as an unknown and unsupported 
suitor.  Her reception would have been such at the 
hands of Crossley's insolent and ill-mannered underlings 
that she would have fled in shame and confusion. 
It is even well within the possibilities that she would 
have given up all idea of a career, would have sent for 
Baird, and so on.  And not one of those who, timid 
and inexperienced, have suffered rude rebuff at their first 
advance, would have condemned her.  But it so chanced 
&mdash;whether by good fortune or by ill the event was to 
tell&mdash;that she did not have to face a single underling. 
The hall door was open.  She entered.  It happened 
that while she was coming up in the elevator a 
quarrel between a motorman and a driver had heated 
into a fight, into a small riot.  All the underlings had 
rushed out on a balcony that commanded a superb view 
of the battle.  The connecting doors were open; 
Mildred advanced from room to room, seeking someone who 
would take her card to Mr. Crossley.  When she at 
last faced a closed door she knocked. 
</p><p>"Come!'' cried a pleasant voice. 
</p><p>And in she went, to face Crossley himself&mdash;Crossley, 
the "weak and soft,'' caught behind his last entrenchment 
with no chance to escape.  Had Mildred looked 
the usual sort who come looking for jobs in musical 
comedy, Mr. Crossley would not have risen&mdash;not be-
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0332" n="319"/>     
cause he was snobbish, but because, being a sensitive, 
high-strung person, he instinctively adopted the manner 
that would put the person before him at ease.  He 
glanced at Mildred, rose, and thrust back forthwith the 
slangy, offhand personality that was perhaps the most 
natural&mdash;or was it merely the most used?&mdash;of his 
many personalities.  It was Crossley the man of the 
world, the man of the artistic world, who delighted 
Mildred with a courteous bow and offer of a chair, as he 
said: 
</p><p>"You wished to see me?'' 
</p><p>"If you are Mr. Crossley,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"I should be tempted to say I was, if I wasn't,'' 
said he, and his manner made it a mere pleasantry to 
put her at ease. 
</p><p>"There was no one in the outside room, so I walked 
on and on until your door stopped me.'' 
</p><p>"You'll never know how lucky you were,'' said he. 
"They tell me those fellows out there have shocking 
manners.'' 
</p><p>"Have you time to see me now?  I've come to apply 
for a position in musical comedy.'' 
</p><p>"You have not been on the stage, Miss&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"Gower.  Mildred Gower.  I've decided to use my 
own name.'' 
</p><p>"I know you have not been on the stage.'' 
</p><p>"Except as an amateur&mdash;and not even that for 
several years.  But I've been working at my voice.'' 
</p><p>Crossley was studying her, as she stood talking&mdash; 
she had refused the chair.  He was more than favorably 
impressed.  But the deciding element was not 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0333" n="320"/> 
Mildred's excellent figure or her charm of manner or 
her sweet and lovely face.  It was superstition.  Just 
at that time Crossley had been abruptly deserted by 
Estelle Howard; instead of going on with the rehearsals 
of "The Full Moon,'' in which she was to be starred, 
she had rushed away to Europe with a violinist with 
whom she had fallen in love at the first rehearsal. 
Crossley was looking about for someone to take her 
place.  He had been entrenched in those offices for 
nearly five years; in all that time not a single soul of the 
desperate crowds that dogged him had broken through 
his guard.  Crossley was as superstitious as was everyone 
else who has to do with the stage. 
</p><p>"What kind of a voice?'' asked he. 
</p><p>"Lyric soprano.'' 
</p><p>"You have music there.  What?'' 
</p><p>" `Batti Batti' and a little song in English&mdash;`The 
Rose and the Bee.' '' 
</p><p>Crossley forgot his manners, turned his back squarely 
upon her, thrust his hands deep into his trousers 
pockets, and stared out through the window.  He presently 
wheeled round.  She would not have thought his 
eyes could be so keen.  Said he:  "You were studying 
for grand opera?'' 
</p><p>"Yes.'' 
</p><p>"Why do you drop it and take up this?'' 
</p><p>"No money,'' replied she.  "I've got to make my 
living at once.'' 
</p><p>"Well, let's see.  Come with me, please.'' 
</p><p>They went out by a door into the hall, went back to 
the rear of the building, in at an iron door, down a 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0334" n="321"/> 
flight of steep iron skeleton steps dimly lighted. 
Mildred had often been behind the scenes in her amateur 
theatrical days; but even if she had not, she would have 
known where she was.  Crossley called, "Moldini! 
Moldini!'' 
</p><p>The name was caught up by other voices and 
repeated again and again, more and more remotely.  A 
moment, and a small dark man with a superabundance 
of greasy dark hair appeared.  "Miss Gower,'' said 
Crossley, "this is Signor Moldini.  He will play your 
accompaniments.''  Then to the little Italian, "Piano 
on the stage?'' 
</p><p>"Yes, sir.'' 
</p><p>To Mildred with a smile, "Will you try?'' 
</p><p>She bent her head.  She had no voice&mdash;not for song, 
not for speech, not even for a monosyllable. 
</p><p>Crossley took Moldini aside where Mildred could not 
hear.  "Mollie,'' said he, "this girl crept up on me, 
and I've got to give her a trial.  As you see, she's a 
lady, and you know what they are.'' 
</p><p>"Punk,'' said Moldini. 
</p><p>Crossley nodded.  "She seems a nice sort, so I want 
to let her down easy.  I'll sit back in the house, in the 
dark.  Run her through that `Batti Batti' thing she's 
got with her.  If she's plainly on the fritz, I'll light a 
cigarette.  If I don't light up, try the other song she 
has.  If I still don't light up make her go through that 
`Ah, were you here, love,' from the piece.  But if 
I light up, it means that I'm going to light out, and 
that you're to get rid of her&mdash;tell her we'll let her 
know if she'll leave her address.  You understand?'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0335" n="322"/>
</p><p>"Perfectly.'' 
</p><p>Far from being thrilled and inspired, her surroundings 
made her sick at heart&mdash;the chill, the dampness, 
the bare walls, the dim, dreary lights, the coarsely-painted flats&mdash;  At last she was on the threshold of her 
chosen profession.  What a profession for such a person 
as she had always been!  She stood beside Moldini, 
seated at the piano.  She gazed at the darkness, 
somewhere in whose depths Crossley was hidden.  After 
several false starts she sang the "Batti Batti'' through, 
sang it atrociously&mdash;not like a poor professional, but 
like a pretentious amateur, a reversion to a manner of 
singing she had once had, but had long since got rid of. 
She paused at the end, appalled by the silence, by the 
awfulness of her own performance. 
</p><p>From the darkness a slight click.  If she had known! 
&mdash;for, it was Crossley's match-safe. 
</p><p>The sound, slight yet so clear, startled her, roused 
her.  She called out:  "Mr. Crossley, won't you please 
be patient enough to let me try that again?'' 
</p><p>A brief hesitation, then:  "Certainly.'' 
</p><p>Once more she began.  But this time there was no 
hesitation.  From first to last she did it as Jennings 
had coached her, did it with all the beauty and energy 
of her really lovely voice.  As she ended, Moldini said 
in a quiet but intense undertone:  "Bravo!  Bravo! 
Fresh as a bird on a bright spring morning.''  And 
from the darkness came:  "Ah&mdash;that's better, Miss 
Gower.  That was professional work.  Now for the 
other.'' 
</p><p>Thus encouraged and with her voice well warmed, she 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0336" n="323"/>  
could not but make a success of the song that was nearer 
to what would be expected of her in musical comedy. 
Crossley called out:  "Now, the sight singing, Moldini. 
I don't expect you to do this well, Miss Gower.  I simply 
wish to get an idea of how you'd do a piece we 
have in rehearsal.'' 
</p><p>"You'll have no trouble with this,'' said Moldini, as 
he opened the comedy song upon the rack with a 
contemptuous whirl.  "It's the easy showy stuff that suits 
the tired business man and his laced-in wife.  Go at it 
and yell.'' 
</p><p>Mildred glanced through it.  There was a subtle 
something in the atmosphere now that put her at her 
ease.  She read the words aloud, laughing at their silly 
sentimentality, she and Moldini and Crossley making 
jokes about it.  Soon she said:  "I'm ready.'' 
</p><p>She sang it well.  She asked them to let her try it 
again.  And the second time, with the words in her 
mind and the simple melody, she was able to put 
expression into it and to indicate, with restraint, the 
action.  Crossley came down the aisle. 
</p><p>"What do you think, Mollie?'' he said to Moldini. 
</p><p>"We might test her at a few rehearsals.'' 
</p><p>Crossley meekly accepted the salutary check on his 
enthusiasm.  "Do you wish to try, Miss Gower?'' 
</p><p>Mildred was silent.  She knew now the sort of piece 
in which she was to appear.  She had seen a few of 
them, those cheap and vulgar farces with their thin 
music, their more than dubious-looking people.  What 
a come-down!  What a degradation!  It was as bad 
in its way as being the wife of General Siddall.  And 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0337" n="324"/> 
she was to do this, in preference to marrying Stanley 
Baird. 
</p><p>"You will be paid, of course, during rehearsal; that 
is, as long as we are taking your time.  Fifty dollars 
a week is about as much as we can afford.''  Crossley 
was watching her shrewdly, was advancing these 
remarks in response to the hesitation he saw so plainly. 
"Of course it isn't grand opera,'' he went on.  "In 
fact, it's pretty low&mdash;almost as low as the public taste. 
You see, we aren't subsidized by millionaires who want 
people to think they're artistic, so we have to hustle to 
separate the public from its money.  But if you make 
a hit, you can earn enough to put you into grand opera 
in fine style.'' 
</p><p>"I never heard of anyone's graduating from here 
into grand opera,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"Because our stars make so much money and make 
it so easily.  It'll be your own fault if you don't.'' 
</p><p>"Can't I come to just one rehearsal&mdash;to see whether 
I can&mdash;can do it?'' pleaded Mildred. 
</p><p>Crossley, made the more eager and the more superstitious 
by this unprecedented reluctance, shook his head. 
</p><p>"No.  You must agree to stay as long as we want 
you,'' said he.  "We can't allow ourselves to be trifled 
with.'' 
</p><p>"Very well,'' said Mildred resignedly.  "I will 
rehearse as long as you want me.'' 
</p><p>"And will stay for the run of the piece, if we want 
that?'' said Crossley.  "You to get a hundred a week 
if you are put in the cast.  More, of course, if you 
make a hit.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0338" n="325"/>
</p><p>"You mean I'm to sign a contract?'' cried Mildred 
in dismay. 
</p><p>"Exactly,'' said Crossley.  A truly amazing 
performance.  Moldini was not astonished, however, for he 
had heard the songs, and he knew Crossley's difficulties 
through Estelle Howard's flight.  Also, he knew Crossley&mdash; 
never so "weak and soft'' that he trifled with 
unlikely candidates for his productions.  Crossley had got 
up because he knew what to do and when to do it. 
</p><p>Mildred acquiesced.  Before she was free to go into 
the street again, she had signed a paper that bound her 
to rehearse for three weeks at fifty dollars a week and 
to stay on at a hundred dollars a week for forty weeks 
or the run of "The Full Moon,'' if Crossley so desired; 
if he did not, she was free at the end of the rehearsals. 
A shrewdly one-sided contract.  But Crossley told himself 
he would correct it, if she should by some remote 
chance be good enough for the part and should make 
a hit in it.  This was no mere salve to conscience, by 
the way.  Crossley would not be foolish enough to give 
a successful star just cause for disliking and distrusting 
him and at the earliest opportunity leaving him to make 
money for some rival manager. 
</p><p>Mrs. Belloc had not gone out, had been waiting in a 
fever of anxiety.  When Mildred came into her sitting-room with a gloomy face and dropped to a chair as if 
her last hope had abandoned her, it was all Agnes Belloc 
could do to restrain her tears.  Said she: 
</p><p>"Don't be foolish, my dear.  You couldn't expect 
anything to come of your first attempt.'' 
</p><p>"That isn't it,'' said Mildred.  "I think I'll give it 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0339" n="326"/>  
up&mdash;do something else.  Grand opera's bad enough. 
There were a lot of things about it that I was fighting 
my distaste for.'' 
</p><p>"I know,'' said Agnes.  "And you'd better fight 
them hard.  They're unworthy of you.'' 
</p><p>"But&mdash;musical comedy!  It's&mdash;frightful!'' 
</p><p>"It's an honest way of making a living, and that's 
more than can be said of&mdash;of some things.  I suppose 
you're afraid you'll have to wear tights&mdash;or some 
nonsense like that.'' 
</p><p>"No, no.  It's doing it at all.  Such rotten music 
&mdash;and what a loathsome mess!'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Belloc's eyes flashed.  "I'm losing all 
patience!'' she cried.  "I know you've been brought up 
like a fool and always surrounded by fools.  I suppose 
you'd rather sell yourself to some man.  Do you know 
what's the matter with you, at bottom?  Why, you're 
lazy and you're a coward.  Too lazy to work.  And 
afraid of what a lot of cheap women'll say&mdash;women 
earning their board and clothes in about the lowest way 
such a thing can be done.  Haven't you got any self-respect?'' 
</p><p>Mildred rose.  "Mrs. Belloc,'' she said angrily, "I 
can't permit even you to say such things to me.'' 
</p><p>"The shoe seems to fit,'' retorted Mrs. Belloc.  "I 
never yet saw a lady, a real, silk-and-diamonds, sit-in-the-parlor lady, who had any self-respect.  If I had 
my way they wouldn't get a mouthful to eat till they 
had earned it.  That'd be a sure cure for the lady 
disease.  I'm ashamed of you, Miss Stevens!  And you're 
ashamed of yourself.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0340" n="327"/>  
</p><p>"Yes, I am,'' said Mildred, with a sudden change of 
mood. 
</p><p>"The best thing you can do is to rest till lunch-time. 
Then start out after lunch and hunt a job.  I'll go 
with you.'' 
</p><p>"But I've got a job,'' said Mildred.  "That's what's 
the matter.'' 
</p><p>Agnes Belloc's jaw dropped and her rather heavy 
eyebrows shot up toward the low sweeping line of her 
auburn hair.  She made such a ludicrous face that Mildred 
laughed outright.  Said she: 
</p><p>"It's quite time.  Fifty a week, for three weeks of 
rehearsal.  No doubt <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can go on if I like.  
Nothing 
could be easier.'' 
</p><p>"Crossley?'' 
</p><p>"Yes.  He was very nice&mdash;heard me sing three 
pieces&mdash;and it was all settled.  I'm to begin to-morrow.'' 
</p><p>The color rose in Agnes Belloc's face until she looked 
apoplectic.  She abruptly retreated to her bedroom. 
After a few minutes she came back, her normal complexion 
restored.  "I couldn't trust myself to speak,'' 
said she.  "That was the worst case of ingratitude 
I ever met up with.  You, getting a place at fifty 
dollars a week&mdash;and on your first trial&mdash;and 
you come in looking as if you'd lost your money and 
your reputation.  What kind of a girl are you, anyway?'' 
</p><p>"I don't know,'' said Mildred.  "I wish I did.'' 
</p><p>"Well, I'm sorry you got it so easy.  Now you'll 
have a false notion from the start.  It's always better 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0341" n="328"/> 
to have a hard time getting things.  Then you appreciate 
them, and have learned how to hold on.'' 
</p><p>"No trouble about holding on to this,'' said Mildred 
carelessly. 
</p><p>"Please don't talk that way, child,'' pleaded Agnes, 
almost tearful.  "It's frightful to me, who've had 
experience, to hear you invite a fall-down.'' 
</p><p>Mildred disdainfully fluttered the typewritten copy of 
the musical comedy.  "This is child's play,'' said she. 
"The lines are beneath contempt.  As for the songs, 
you never heard such slop.'' 
</p><p>"The stars in those pieces get four and five hundred, 
and more, a week,'' said Mrs. Belloc.  "Believe me, 
those managers don't pay out any such sums for child's 
play.  You look out.  You're going at this wrong.'' 
</p><p>"I shan't care if I do fail,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"Do you mean that?'' demanded Mrs. Belloc. 
</p><p>"No, I don't,'' said Mildred.  "Oh, I don't know 
what I mean.'' 
</p><p>"I guess you're just talking,'' said Mrs. Belloc after 
a reflective silence.  "I guess a girl who goes and gets 
a good job, first crack out of the box, must have a 
streak of shrewdness.'' 
</p><p>"I hope so,'' said Mildred doubtfully. 
</p><p>"I guess you'll work hard, all right.  After you 
went out this morning, I took that paper down to Miss 
Blond.  She's crazy about it.  She wants to make a 
copy of it.  I told her I'd ask you.'' 
</p><p>"Certainly,'' said Mildred. 
"She says she'll return it the same day.'' 
</p><p>"Tell her she can keep it as long as she likes.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0342" n="329"/> 
</p><p>Mrs. Belloc eyed her gravely, started to speak, 
checked herself.  Instead, she said, "No, I shan't do 
that.  I'll have it back in your room by this evening. 
You might change your mind, and want to use it.'' 
</p><p>"Very well,'' said Mildred, pointedly uninterested and 
ignoring Mrs. Belloc's delicate but distinct emphasis 
upon "might.'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Belloc kept a suspicious eye upon her&mdash;an eye 
that was not easily deceived.  The more she thought 
about Mildred's state of depression and disdain the more 
tolerant she became.  That mood was the natural and 
necessary result of the girl's bringing up and mode of 
life.  The important thing&mdash;and the wonderful thing 
&mdash;was her being able to overcome it.  After a week of 
rehearsal she said:  "I'm making the best of it.  But 
I don't like it, and never shall.'' 
</p><p>"I should hope not,'' replied Mrs. Belloc.  "You're 
going to the top.  I'd hate to see you contented at the 
bottom.  Aren't you learning a good deal that'll be 
useful later on?'' 
</p><p>"That's why I'm reconciled to it,'' said she.  "The 
stage director, Mr. Ransdell, is teaching me everything 
&mdash;even how to sing.  He knows his business.'' 
</p><p>Ransdell not only knew, but also took endless pains 
with her.  He was a tall, thin, dark man, strikingly 
handsome in the distinguished way.  So distinguished 
looking was he that to meet him was to wonder why he 
had not made a great name for himself.  An extraordinary 
mind he certainly had, and an insight into the 
reasons for things that is given only to genius.  He 
had failed as a composer, failed as a playwright, failed 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0343" n="330"/>
as a singer, failed as an actor.  He had been forced 
to take up the profession of putting on dramatic and 
musical plays, a profession that required vast knowledge 
and high talents and paid for them in niggardly 
fashion both in money and in fame.  Crossley owed to 
him more than to any other single element the series 
of successes that had made him rich; yet the ten thousand 
a year Crossley paid him was regarded as evidence 
of Crossley's lavish generosity and was so.  It 
would have been difficult to say why a man so splendidly 
endowed by nature and so tireless in improving himself 
was thus unsuccessful.  Probably he lacked judgment; 
indeed, that lack must have been the cause.  He could 
judge for Crossley; but not for himself, not when he 
had the feeling of ultimate responsibility. 
</p><p>Mildred had anticipated the most repulsive associations&mdash; 
men and women of low origin and of vulgar 
tastes and of vulgarly loose lives.  She found herself 
surrounded by simple, pleasant people, undoubtedly 
erratic for the most part in all their habits, but without 
viciousness.  And they were hard workers, all.  Ransdell 
&mdash;for Crossley&mdash;tolerated no nonsense.  His people 
could live as they pleased, away from the theater, but 
there they must be prompt and fit.  The discipline was 
as severe as that of a monastery.  She saw many signs 
that all sorts of things of the sort with which she wished 
to have no contact were going on about her; but as she 
held slightly&mdash;but not at all haughtily&mdash;aloof, she 
would have had to go out of her way to see enough to 
scandalize her.  She soon suspected that she was being 
treated with extraordinary consideration.  This was by 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0344" n="331"/>  
Crossley's orders.  But the carrying out of their spirit 
as well as their letter was due to Ransdell.  Before the 
end of that first week she knew that there was the 
personal element behind his admiration for her voice and 
her talent for acting, behind his concentrating most of 
his attention upon her part.  He looked his love boldly 
whenever they were alone; he was always trying to 
touch her&mdash;never in a way that she could have resented, 
or felt like resenting.  He was not unattractive to her, 
and she was eager to learn all he had to teach, and saw 
no harm in helping herself by letting him love. 
</p><p>Toward the middle of the second week, when they were 
alone in her dressing-room, he&mdash;with the ingenious 
lack of abruptness of the experienced man at the game 
&mdash;took her hand, and before she was ready, kissed her. 
He did not accompany these advances with an outburst 
of passionate words or with any fiery lighting up of the 
eyes, but calmly, smilingly, as if it were what she was 
expecting him to do, what he had a right to do. 
</p><p>She did not know quite how to meet this novel attack. 
She drew her hand away, went on talking about the 
part&mdash;the changes he had suggested in her entrance, 
as she sang her best solo.  He discussed this with her 
until they rose to leave the theater.  He looked 
smilingly down on her, and said with the flattering air of 
the satisfied connoisseur: 
</p><p>"Yes, you are charming, Mildred.  I can make a 
great artist and a great success out of you.  We need 
each other.'' 
</p><p>"I certainly need you,'' said she gratefully.  "How 
much you've done for me.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0345" n="332"/>  
</p><p>"Only the beginning,'' replied he.  "Ah, I have 
such plans for you&mdash;such plans.  Crossley doesn't 
realize how far you can be made to go&mdash;with the right 
training.  Without it&mdash;''  He shook his head laughingly. 
"But you shall have it, my dear.''  And he 
laid his hands lightly and caressingly upon her shoulders. 
</p><p>The gesture was apparently a friendly familiarity. 
To resent it, even to draw away, would put her in the 
attitude of the woman absurdly exercised about the 
desirability and sacredness of her own charms. 
</p><p>Still smiling, in that friendly, assured way, he went 
on:  "You've been very cold and reserved with me, my 
dear.  Very unappreciative.'' 
</p><p>Mildred, red and trembling, hung her head in confusion. 
</p><p>"I've been at the business ten years,'' he went on, 
"and you're the first woman I've been more than casually 
interested in.  The pretty ones were bores.  The 
homely ones&mdash;I can't interest myself in a homely 
woman, no matter how much talent she has.  A woman 
must first of all satisfy the eye.  And you&mdash;''  He 
seated himself and drew her toward him.  She, cold all 
over and confused in mind and almost stupefied, resisted 
with all her strength; but her strength seemed to be 
oozing away.  She said: 
</p><p>"You must not do this.  You must not do this.  I'm 
horribly disappointed in you.'' 
</p><p>He drew her to his lap and held her there without 
any apparent tax upon his strength.  He kissed her, 
laughingly pushing away the arms with which she tried 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0346" n="333"/>  
to shield her face.  Suddenly she found strength to 
wrench herself free and stood at a distance from him. 
She was panting a little, was pale, was looking at him 
with cold anger. 
</p><p>"You will please leave this room,'' said she. 
</p><p>He lit a cigarette, crossed his legs comfortably, and 
looked at her with laughing eyes.  "Don't do that,'' he 
said genially.  "Surely my lessons in acting haven't 
been in vain.  That's too obviously a pose.'' 
</p><p>She went to the mirror, arranged her hat, and moved 
toward the door.  He rose and barred the way. 
</p><p>"You are as sensible as you are sweet and lovely,'' 
said he.  "Why should you insist on our being bad 
friends?'' 
</p><p>"If you don't stand aside, I'll call out to the watchman.'' 
</p><p>"I'd never have thought you were dishonest.  In 
fact, I don't believe it yet.  You don't look like one of 
those ladies who wish to take everything and give 
nothing.''  His tone and manner were most attractive. 
Besides, she could not forget all he had 
done for her&mdash;and all he could do for her.  Said 
she: 
</p><p>"Mr. Ransdell, if I've done anything to cause you to 
misunderstand, it was unconscious.  And I'm sorry. 
But I&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"Be honest,'' interrupted he.  "Haven't I made it 
plain that I was fascinated by you?'' 
</p><p>She could not deny it. 
</p><p>"Haven't I been showing you that I was willing to 
do everything I could for you?'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0347" n="334"/> 
</p><p>"I thought you were concerned only about the 
success of the piece.'' 
</p><p>"The piece be jiggered,'' said he.  "You don't 
imagine <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are necessary to its success, do you?  
You, 
a raw, untrained girl.  Don't your good sense tell you 
I could find a dozen who would do, let us say, <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> 
as well?'' 
</p><p>"I understand that,'' murmured she. 
</p><p>"Perhaps you do, but I doubt it,'' rejoined he. 
"Vanity's a fast growing weed.  However, I rather 
expected that you would remain sane and reasonably 
humble until you'd had a real success.  But it seems 
not.  Now tell me, why should I give my time and my 
talent to training you&mdash;to putting you in the way of 
quick and big success?'' 
</p><p>She was silent. 
</p><p>"What did you count on giving me in return?  Your 
thanks?'' 
</p><p>She colored, hung her head. 
</p><p>"Wasn't I doing for you something worth while? 
And what had you to give in return?''  He laughed 
with gentle mockery.  "Really, you should have been 
grateful that I was willing to do so much for so little, 
for what I wanted ought&mdash;if you are a sensible woman 
&mdash;to seem to you a trifle in comparison with what I 
was doing for you.  It was my part, not yours, to think 
the complimentary things about you.  How shallow and 
vain you women are!  Can't you see that the value of 
your charms is not in them, but in the imagination of 
some man?'' 
</p><p>"I can't answer you,'' said she.  "You've put it all 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0348" n="335"/>  
wrong.  You oughtn't to ask payment for a favor beyond price.'' 
</p><p>"No, I oughtn't to <hi rend="italic">have</hi> to ask,'' corrected 
he, in the 
same pleasantly ironic way.  "You ought to have been 
more than glad to give freely.  But, curiously, while 
we've been talking, I've changed my mind about those 
precious jewels of yours.  We'll say they're pearls, and 
that my taste has suddenly changed to diamonds.''  He 
bowed mockingly.  "So, dear lady, keep your pearls.'' 
</p><p>And he stood aside, opening the door for her.  She 
hesitated, dazed that she was leaving, with the feeling 
of the conquered, a field on which, by all the precedents, 
she ought to have been victor.  She passed a troubled 
night, debated whether to relate her queer experience to 
Mrs. Belloc, decided for silence.  It drafted into service 
all her reserve of courage to walk into the theater the 
next day and to appear on the stage among the assembled 
company with her usual air.  Ransdell greeted her 
with his customary friendly courtesy and gave her his 
attention, as always.  By the time they had got through 
the first act, in which her part was one of four of about 
equal importance, she had recovered herself and was in 
the way to forget the strange stage director's strange 
attack and even stranger retreat.  But the situation 
changed with the second act, in which she was on the 
stage all the time and had the whole burden.  The act 
as originally written had been less generous to her; but 
Ransdell had taken one thing after another away from 
the others and had given it to her.  She made her first 
entrance precisely as he had trained her to make it and 
began.  A few seconds, and he stopped her. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0349" n="336"/>  
</p><p>"Please try again, Miss Gower,'' said he.  "I'm 
afraid that won't do.'' 
</p><p>She tried again; again he stopped her.  She tried a 
third time.  His manner was all courtesy and consideration, 
not the shade of a change.  But she began to 
feel a latent hostility.  Instinctively she knew that 
he would no longer help her, that he would leave 
her to her own resources, and judge her by how she 
acquitted herself.  She made a blunder of her third 
trial. 
</p><p>"Really, Miss Gower, that will never do,'' said he 
mildly.  "Let me show you how you did it.'' 
</p><p>He gave an imitation of her&mdash;a slight caricature. 
A titter ran through the chorus.  He sternly rebuked 
them and requested her to try again.  Her fourth 
attempt was her worst.  He shook his head in gentle 
remonstrance.  "Not quite right yet,'' said he 
regretfully.  "But we'll go on.'' 
</p><p>Not far, however.  He stopped her again.  Again 
the courteous, kindly criticism.  And so on, through 
the entire act.  By the end of it, Mildred's nerves were 
unstrung.  She saw the whole game, and realized how 
helpless she was.  Before the end of that rehearsal, 
Mildred had slipped back from promising professional into 
clumsy amateur, tolerable only because of the beautiful 
freshness of her voice&mdash;and it was a question whether 
voice alone would save her.  Yet no one but Mildred 
herself suspected that Ransdell had done it, had 
revenged himself, had served notice on her that since she 
felt strong enough to stand alone she was to have every 
opportunity to do so.  He had said nothing disagree-
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0350" n="337"/>     
able; on the contrary, he had been most courteous, most 
forbearing. 
</p><p>In the third act she was worse than in the second. 
At the end of the rehearsal the others, theretofore 
flattering and encouraging, turned away to talk among 
themselves and avoided her.  Ransdell, about to leave, 
said: 
</p><p>"Don't look so down-hearted, Miss Gower.  You'll 
be all right to-morrow.  An off day's nothing.'' 
</p><p>He said it loudly enough for the others to hear. 
Mildred's face grew red with white streaks across it, like 
the prints of a lash.  The subtlest feature of his 
malevolence had been that, whereas on other days he had 
taken her aside to criticize her, on this day he had 
spoken out&mdash;gently, deprecatingly, but frankly&mdash;before 
the whole company.  Never had Mildred Gower 
been so sad and so blue as she was that day and that 
night.  She came to the rehearsal the following day with 
a sore throat.  She sang, but her voice cracked on the 
high notes.  It was a painful exhibition.  Her fellow 
principals, who had been rather glad of her set-back 
the day before, were full of pity and sympathy.  They 
did not express it; they were too kind for that.  But 
their looks, their drawing away from her&mdash;Mildred 
could have borne sneers and jeers better.  And Ransdell 
was <hi rend="italic">so</hi> forbearing, <hi rend="italic">so</hi> 
gentle. 
</p><p>Her voice got better, got worse.  Her acting 
remained mediocre to bad.  At the fifth rehearsal after 
the break with the stage-director, Mildred saw Crossley 
seated far back in the dusk of the empty theater.  It was 
his first appearance at rehearsals since the middle of 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0351" n="338"/>
the first week.  As soon as he had satisfied himself that 
all was going well, he had given his attention to other 
matters where things were not going well.  Mildred 
knew why he was there&mdash;and she acted and sang atrociously. 
Ransdell aggravated her nervousness by ostentatiously 
trying to help her, by making seemingly 
adroit attempts to cover her mistakes&mdash;attempts 
apparently thwarted and exposed only because she was 
hopelessly bad. 
</p><p>In the pause between the second and third acts 
Ransdell went down and sat with Crossley, and they engaged 
in earnest conversation.  The while, the members of the 
company wandered restlessly about the stage, making 
feeble attempts to lift the gloom with affected cheerfulness. 
Ransdell returned to the stage, went up to Mildred, 
who was sitting idly turning the leaves of a 
part-book. 
</p><p>"Miss Gower,'' said he, and never had his voice been 
so friendly as in these regretful accents, "don't try to 
go on to-day.  You're evidently not yourself.  Go home 
and rest for a few days.  We'll get along with your 
understudy, Miss Esmond.  When Mr. Crossley wants 
to put you in again, he'll send for you.  You mustn't 
be discouraged.  I know how beginners take these 
things to heart.  Don't fret about it.  You can't fail 
to succeed.'' 
</p><p>Mildred rose and, how she never knew, crossed the 
stage.  She stumbled into the flats, fumbled her way to 
the passageway, to her dressing-room.  She felt that 
she must escape from that theater quickly, or she would 
give way to some sort of wild attack of nerves.  She 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0352" n="339"/> 
fairly ran through the streets to Mrs. Belloc's, shut 
herself in her room.  But instead of the relief of a storm of 
tears, there came a black, hideous depression.  Hour 
after hour she sat, almost without motion.  The afternoon 
waned; the early darkness came.  Still she did not 
move&mdash;could not move.  At eight o'clock Mrs. Belloc 
knocked.  Mildred did not answer.  Her door opened 
&mdash;she had forgotten to lock it.  In came Mrs. Belloc. 
</p><p>"Isn't that you, sitting by the window?'' she said. 
</p><p>"Yes,'' replied Mildred. 
</p><p>"I recognized the outline of your hat.  Besides, who 
else could it be but you?  I've saved some dinner for 
you.  I thought you were still out.'' 
</p><p>Mildred did not answer. 
</p><p>"What's the matter?'' said Agnes?  "Ill? bad 
news?'' 
</p><p>"I've lost my position,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>A pause.  Then Mrs. Belloc felt her way across the 
room until she was touching the girl.  "Tell me about 
it, dear,'' said she. 
</p><p>In a monotonous, lifeless way Mildred told the story. 
It was some time after she finished when Agnes said: 
</p><p>"That's bad&mdash;bad, but it might be worse.  You 
must go to see the manager, Crossley.'' 
</p><p>"Why?'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"Tell him what you told me.'' 
</p><p>Mildred's silence was dissent. 
</p><p>"It can't do any harm,'' urged Agnes. 
</p><p>"It can't do any good,'' replied Mildred. 
</p><p>"That isn't the way to look at it.'' 
</p><p>A long pause.  Then Mildred said:  "If I got a 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0353" n="340"/>
place somewhere else, I'd meet the same thing in 
another form.'' 
</p><p>"You've got to risk that.'' 
</p><p>"Besides, I'd never have had a chance of succeeding 
if Mr. Ransdell hadn't taught me and stood behind 
me.'' 
</p><p>It was many minutes before Agnes Belloc said in a 
hesitating, restrained voice:  "They say that success 
&mdash;any kind of success&mdash;has its price, and that one has 
to be ready to pay that price or fail.'' 
</p><p>Again the profound silence.  Into it gradually 
penetrated the soft, insistent sound of the distant roar of 
New York&mdash;a cruel, clamorous, devouring sound like 
a demand for that price of success.  Said Agnes timidly: 
</p><p>"Why not go to see Mr. Ransdell.'' 
</p><p>"He wouldn't make it up,'' said Mildred.  "And I 
&mdash;I couldn't.  I tried to marry Stanley Baird for 
money&mdash;and I couldn't.  It would be the same way 
now&mdash;only more so.'' 
</p><p>"But you've got to do something.'' 
</p><p>"Yes, and I will.''  Mildred had risen abruptly, was 
standing at the window.  Agnes Belloc could feel her 
soul rearing defiantly at the city into which she was 
gazing.  "I will!'' she replied. 
</p><p>"It sounds as if you'd been pushed to where you'd 
turn and make a fight,'' said Agnes. 
</p><p>"I hope so,'' said Mildred.  "It's high time.'' 
</p><p>She thought out several more or less ingenious 
indirect routes into Mr. Crossley's stronghold, for use in 
case frontal attack failed.  But she did not need them. 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0354" n="341"/> 
Still, the hours she spent in planning them were by no 
means wasted.  No time is wasted that is spent in desperate, 
concentrated thinking about any of the practical 
problems of life.  And Mildred Gower, as much 
as any other woman of her training&mdash;or lack of training&mdash; 
was deficient in ability to use her mind purposefully. 
Most of us let our minds act like a sheep in a 
pasture&mdash;go wandering hither and yon, nibbling at 
whatever happens to offer.  Only the superior few 
deliberately select a pasture, select a line of procedure in 
that pasture and keep to it, concentrating upon what 
is useful to us, and that alone.  So it was excellent 
experience for Mildred to sit down and think connectedly 
and with wholly absorbed mind upon the phase of her 
career most important at the moment.  When she had 
worked out all the plans that had promise in them she 
went tranquilly to sleep, a stronger and a more determined 
person, for she had said with the energy that 
counts:  "I shall see him, somehow.  If none of these 
schemes works, I'll work out others.  He's got to see 
me.'' 
</p><p>But it was no occult "bearing down'' that led him 
to order her admitted the instant her card came.  He 
liked her; he wished to see her again; he felt that it 
was the decent thing, and somehow not difficult gently 
but clearly to convey to her the truth.  On her side she, 
who had looked forward to the interview with some 
nervousness, was at her ease the moment she faced him 
alone in that inner office.  He had extraordinary personal 
charm&mdash;more than Ransdell, though Ransdell 
had the charm invariably found in a handsome human 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0355" n="342"/>  
being with the many-sided intellect that gives lightness 
of mind.  Crossley was not intellectual, not in the 
least.  One had only to glance at him to see that he 
was one of those men who reserve all their intelligence 
for the practical sides of the practical thing that forms 
the basis of their material career.  He knew something 
of many things, had a wonderful assortment of talents 
&mdash;could sing, could play piano or violin, could compose, 
could act, could do mystifying card tricks, could order 
women's clothes as discriminatingly as he could order 
his own&mdash;all these things a little, but nothing much 
except making a success of musical comedy and comic 
opera.  He had an ambition, carefully restrained in a 
closet of his mind, where it could not issue forth and 
interfere with his business.  This ambition was to be a 
giver of grand opera on a superb scale.  He regarded 
himself as a mere money-maker&mdash;was not ashamed of 
this, but neither was he proud of it.  His ambition then 
represented a dream of a rise to something more than 
business man, to friend and encourager and wet nurse 
to art. 
</p><p>Mildred Gower had happened to set his imagination 
to working.  The discovery that she was one of those 
whose personalities rouse high expectations only to mock 
them had been a severe blow to his confidence in his own 
judgment.  Though he pretended to believe, and had 
the habit of saying that he was "weak and soft,'' was 
always being misled by his good nature, he really 
believed himself an unerring judge of human beings, and, 
as his success evidenced, he was not far wrong.  Thus, 
though convinced that Mildred was a "false alarm,'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0356" n="343"/>  
his secret vanity would not let him release his original 
idea.  He had the tenacity that is an important element 
in all successes; and tenacity become a fixed habit has 
even been known to ruin in the end the very careers it 
has made. 
</p><p>Said Mildred, in a manner which was astonishingly 
unemotional and businesslike:  "I've not come to tattle 
and to whine, Mr. Crossley.  I've hesitated about coming 
at all, partly because I've an instinct it's useless, 
partly because what I have to say isn't easy.'' 
</p><p>Crossley's expression hardened.  The old story!&mdash; 
excuses, excuses, self-excuse&mdash;somebody else to blame. 
</p><p>"If it hadn't been for Mr. Ransdell&mdash;the trouble 
he took with me, the coaching he gave me&mdash;I'd have 
been a ridiculous failure at the very first rehearsal.  But 
&mdash;it is to Mr. Ransdell that my failure is due.'' 
</p><p>"My dear Miss Gower,'' said Crossley, polite but 
cold, "I regret hearing you say that.  The fact is 
very different.  Not until you had done so&mdash;so 
unacceptably at several rehearsals that news of it reached 
me by another way&mdash;not until I myself went to Mr. 
Ransdell about you did he admit that there could be a 
possibility of a doubt of your succeeding.  I had to go 
to rehearsal myself and directly order him to restore 
Miss Esmond and lay you off.'' 
</p><p>Mildred was not unprepared.  She received this 
tranquilly.  "Mr. Ransdell is a very clever man,'' said she 
with perfect good humor.  "I've no hope of convincing 
you, but I must tell my side.'' 
</p><p>And clearly and simply, with no concealments through 
fear of disturbing his high ideal of her ladylike deli-
      <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0357" n="344"/> 
cacy, she told him the story.  He listened, seated well 
back in his tilted desk-chair, his gaze upon the ceiling. 
When she finished he held his pose a moment, then got 
up and paced the length of the office several times, his 
hands in his pockets.  He paused, looked keenly at her, 
a good-humored smile in those eyes of his so fascinating 
to women because of their frank wavering of an inconstancy 
it would indeed be a triumph to seize and hold. 
Said he: 
</p><p>"And your bad throat?  Did Ransdell give you a 
germ?'' 
</p><p>She colored.  He had gone straight at the weak 
point. 
</p><p>"If you'd been able to sing,'' he went on, "nobody 
could have done you up.'' 
</p><p>She could not gather herself together for speech. 
</p><p>"Didn't you know your voice wasn't reliable when 
you came to me?'' 
</p><p>"Yes,'' she admitted. 
</p><p>"And wasn't that the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> reason you had 
given up 
grand opera?'' pursued he mercilessly. 
</p><p>"The reason was what I told you&mdash;lack of money,'' 
replied she.  "I did not go into the reason why I lacked 
money.  Why should I when, even on my worst days, 
I could get through all my part in a musical comedy&mdash; 
except songs that could be cut down or cut out?  If I 
could have made good at acting, would you have given 
me up on account of my voice?'' 
</p><p>"Not if you had been good enough,'' he admitted. 
</p><p>"Then I did not get my engagement on false pretenses?'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0358" n="345"/> 
</p><p>"No.  You are right.  Still, your fall-down as a 
singer is the important fact.  Don't lose sight of it.'' 
</p><p>"I shan't,'' said she tersely. 
</p><p>His eyes were frankly laughing.  "As to Ransdell 
&mdash;what a clever trick!  He's a remarkable man.  If 
he weren't so shrewd in those little ways, he might have 
been a great man.  Same old story&mdash;just a little too 
smart, and so always doing the little thing and missing 
the big thing.  Yes, he went gunning for you&mdash;and 
got you.''  He dropped into his chair.  He thought a 
moment, laughed aloud, went on:  "No doubt he has 
worked that same trick many a time.  I've suspected it 
once or twice, but this time he fooled me.  He got you, 
Miss Gower, and I can do nothing.  You must see that 
I can't look after details.  And I can't give up as 
invaluable a man as Ransdell.  If I put you back, he'd 
put you out&mdash;would make the piece fail rather than let 
you succeed.'' 
</p><p>Mildred was gazing somberly at the floor. 
</p><p>"It's hard lines&mdash;devilish hard lines,'' he went on 
sympathetically.  "But what can I do?'' 
</p><p>"What can I do?'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"Do as all people do who succeed&mdash;meet the conditions.'' 
</p><p>"I'm not prepared to go as far as that, at least not 
yet,'' said she with bitter sarcasm.  "Perhaps when 
I'm actually starving and in rags&mdash;'' 
</p><p>"A very distressing future,'' interrupted Crossley. 
"But&mdash;I didn't make the world.  Don't berate me. 
Be sensible&mdash;and be honest, Miss Gower, and tell me&mdash; 
how could I possibly protect you and continue to give 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0359" n="346"/> 
successful shows?  If you can suggest any feasible way, 
I'll take it.'' 
</p><p>"No, there isn't any way,'' replied she, rising to go. 
</p><p>He rose to escort her to the hall door.  "Personally, 
the Ransdell sort of thing is&mdash;distasteful to me.  Perhaps 
if I were not so busy I might be forced by my own 
giddy misconduct to take less high ground.  I've 
observed that the best that can be said for human nature 
at its best is that it is as well behaved as its real 
temptations permit.  He was making you, you know.  You've 
admitted it.'' 
</p><p>"There's no doubt about that,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"Mind you, I'm not excusing him.  I'm simply 
explaining him.  If your voice had been all right&mdash;if 
you could have stood to any degree the test he put you 
to, the test of standing alone&mdash;you'd have defeated 
him.  He wouldn't have dared go on.  He's too shrewd 
to think a real talent can be beaten.'' 
</p><p>The strong lines, the latent character, in Mildred's 
face were so strongly in evidence that looking at her 
then no one would have thought of her beauty or even 
of her sex, but only of the force that resists all and 
overcomes all.  "Yes&mdash;the voice,'' said she.  "The voice.'' 
</p><p>"If it's ever reliable, come to see me.  Until then&mdash;'' 
He put out his hand.  When she gave him hers, he held 
it in a way that gave her no impulse to draw back. 
"You know the conditions of success now.  You must 
prepare to meet them.  If you put yourself at the mercy 
of the Ransdells&mdash;or any other of the petty intriguers 
that beset every avenue of success&mdash;you must take the 
consequences, you must conciliate them as best you can. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0360" n="347"/> 
If you don't wish to be at their mercy, you must do 
your part.'' 
</p><p>She nodded.  He released her hand, opened the hall 
door.  He said: 
</p><p>"Forgive my little lecture.  But I like you, and I 
can't help having hope of you.''  He smiled charmingly, 
his keen, inconstant eyes dimming.  "Perhaps I 
hope because you're young and extremely lovely and I 
am pitifully susceptible.  You see, you'd better go. 
Every man's a Ransdell at heart where pretty women 
are concerned.'' 
</p><p>She did not leave the building.  She went to the 
elevator and asked the boy where she could find Signor 
Moldini.  His office was the big room on the third floor 
where voice candidates were usually tried out, three days 
in the week.  At the moment he was engaged.  Mildred, 
seated in the tiny anteroom, heard through the glass 
door a girl singing, or trying to sing.  It was a 
distressing performance, and Mildred wondered that 
Moldini could be so tolerant as to hear her through.  He 
came to the door with her, thanked her profusely, told 
her he would let her know whenever there was an opening 
"suited to your talents.''  As he observed Mildred, 
he was still sighing and shaking his head over the 
departed candidate. 
</p><p>"Ugly and ignorant!'' he groaned.  "Poor 
creature!  Poor, poor creature.  She makes three dollars a 
week&mdash;in a factory owned by a great philanthropist. 
Three dollars a week.  And she has no way to make a 
cent more.  Miss Gower, they talk about the sad, 
naughty girls who sell themselves in the street to piece 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0361" n="348"/>  
out their wages.  But think, dear young lady, how 
infinitely better of they are than the ugly ones who can't 
piece out their wages.'' 
</p><p>There he looked directly at her for the first time. 
Before she could grasp the tragic sadness of his idea, 
he, with the mobility of candid and highly sensitized 
natures, shifted from melancholy to gay, for in looking 
at her he had caught only the charm of dress, of face, 
of arrangement of hair.  "What a pleasure!'' he 
exclaimed, bursting into smiles and seizing and kissing her 
gloved hands.  "Voice like a bird, face like an angel 
&mdash;only not <hi rend="italic">too </hi>good, no, not <hi rend="italic">too</hi> good.  But it is so 
rare&mdash;to look as one sings, to sing as one looks.'' 
</p><p>For once, compliment, sincere compliment from one 
whose opinion was worth while, gave Mildred pain.  She 
burst out with her news:  "Signor Moldini, I've lost 
my place in the company.  My voice has gone back 
on me.'' 
</p><p>Usually Moldini abounded in the consideration of fine 
natures that have suffered deeply from lack of consideration. 
But he was so astounded that he could only stare 
stupidly at her, smoothing his long greasy hair with his 
thin brown hand. 
</p><p>"It's all my fault; I don't take care of myself,'' she 
went on.  "I don't take care of my health.  At least, 
I hope that's it.'' 
</p><p>"Hope!'' he said, suddenly angry. 
</p><p>"Hope so, because if it isn't that, then I've no chance 
for a career,'' explained she. 
</p><p>He looked at her feet, pointed an uncannily long 
forefinger at them.  "The crossings and sidewalks are 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0362" n="349"/>  
slush&mdash;and you, a singer, without overshoes!  Lunacy! 
Lunacy!'' 
</p><p>"I've never worn overshoes?'' said Mildred apologetically. 
</p><p>"Don't tell me!  I wish not to hear.  It makes me 
&mdash;like madness here.''  He struck his low sloping brow 
with his palm.  "What vanity!  That the feet may 
look well to the passing stranger, no overshoes! 
Rheumatism, sore throat, colds, pneumonia.  Is it not 
disgusting.  If you were a man I should swear in all the 
languages I know&mdash;which are five, including Hungarian, 
and when one swears in Hungarian it is `going 
some,' as you say in America.  Yes, it is going quite 
some.'' 
</p><p>"I shall wear overshoes,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"And indigestion&mdash;you have that?'' 
</p><p>"A little, I guess.'' 
</p><p>"Much&mdash;much, I tell you!'' cried Moldini, shaking 
the long finger at her.  "You Americans!  You eat 
too fast and you eat too much.  That is why you are 
always sick, and consulting the doctors who give the 
medicines that make worse, not better.  Yes, you 
Americans are like children.  You know nothing.  Sing? 
Americans cannot sing until they learn that a stomach 
isn't a waste-basket, to toss everything into.  You have 
been to that throat specialist, Hicks?'' 
</p><p>"Ah, yes,'' said Mildred brightening.  "He said 
there was nothing organically wrong.'' 
</p><p>"He is an ass, and a criminal.  He ruins throats. 
He likes to cut, and he likes to spray.  He sprays those 
poisons that relieve colds and paralyze the throat and 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0363" n="350"/> 
cords.  Americans sing?  It is to laugh!  They have 
too many doctors; they take too many pills.  Do you 
know what your national emblem should be?  A dollar-sign&mdash;yes.  But that for all nations.  No, a pill&mdash;a 
pill, I tell you.  You take pills?'' 
</p><p>"Now and then,'' said Mildred, laughing.  "I admit 
I have several kinds always on hand.'' 
</p><p>"You see!'' cried he triumphantly.  "No, it is not 
mere art that America needs, but more sense about 
eating&mdash;and to keep away from the doctors.  People full 
of pills, they cannot make poems and pictures, and write 
operas and sing them.  Throw away those pills, dear 
young lady, I implore you.'' 
</p><p>"Signor Moldini, I've come to ask you to help 
me.'' 
</p><p>Instantly the Italian cleared his face of its half-humorous, half-querulous expression.  In its place came 
a grave and courteous eagerness to serve her that was a 
pleasure, even if it was not altogether sincere.  And 
Mildred could not believe it sincere.  Why should he 
care what became of her, or be willing to put himself 
out for her? 
</p><p>"You told me one day that you had at one time 
taught singing,'' continued she. 
</p><p>"Until I was starved out?'' replied he.  "I told 
people the truth.  If they could not sing I said so.  If 
they sang badly I told them why, and it was always the 
upset stomach, the foolish food, and people will not take 
care about food.  They will eat what they please, and 
they say eating is good for them, and that anyone who 
opposes them is a crank.  So most of my pupils left, 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0364" n="351"/> 
except those I taught for nothing&mdash;and they did not 
heed me, and came to nothing.'' 
</p><p>"You showed me in ten minutes one day how to cure 
my worst fault.  I've sung better, more naturally ever 
since.'' 
</p><p>"You could sing like the birds.  You do&mdash;almost. 
You could be taught to sing as freely and sweetly and 
naturally as a flower gives perfume.  That is <hi rend="italic">your</hi> 
divine gift, young lady song as pure and fresh as a 
bird's song raining down through the leaves from the 
tree-top.'' 
</p><p>"I have no money.  I've got to get it, and I shall 
get it,'' continued Mildred.  "I want you to teach me 
&mdash;at any hour that you are free.  And I want to know 
how much you will charge, so that I shall know how 
much to get.'' 
</p><p>"Two dollars a lesson.  Or, if you take six lessons 
a week, ten dollars.  Those were my terms.  I could 
not take less.'' 
</p><p>"It is too little,'' said Mildred.  "The poorest kinds 
of teachers get five dollars an hour&mdash;and teach nothing.'' 
</p><p>"Two dollars, ten dollars a week,'' replied he.  "It 
is the most I ever could get.  I will not take more from 
you.'' 
</p><p>"It is too little,'' said she.  "But I'll not insist&mdash; 
for obvious reasons.  Now, if you'll give me your home 
address, I'll go.  When I get the money, I'll write to 
you.'' 
</p><p>"But wait!'' cried he, as she rose to depart.  "Why 
so hurried?  Let us see.  Take of the wrap.  Step be-
   <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0365" n="352"/>     
hind the screen and loosen your corset.  Perhaps even 
you could take it off?'' 
</p><p>"Not without undressing,'' said Mildred.  "But I 
can do that if it's necessary.''  She laughed queerly. 
"From this time on I'll do <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> that's neces-sary.'' 
</p><p>"No,&mdash;never mind.  The dress of woman&mdash;of 
your kind of women.  It is not serious.''  He laughed 
grimly.  "As for the other kind, their dress is the only 
serious thing about them.  It is a mistake to think that 
women who dress badly are serious.  My experience has 
been that they are the most foolish of all.  Fashionable 
dress&mdash;it is part of a woman's tools.  It shows that 
she is good at her business.  The women who try to 
dress like men, they are good neither at men's business 
nor at women's.'' 
</p><p>This, while Mildred was behind the screen, loosening 
her corset&mdash;though, in fact, she wore it so loose at all 
times that she inconvenienced herself simply to show her 
willingness to do as she was told.  When she came out, 
Moldini put her through a rigid physical examination 
&mdash;made her breathe while he held one hand on her 
stomach, the other on her back, listened at her heart, 
opened wide her throat and peered down, thrust his long 
strong fingers deep into the muscles of her arms, her 
throat, her chest, until she had difficulty in not crying 
out with pain. 
</p><p>"The foundation is there,'' was his verdict.  "You 
have a good body, good muscles, but flabby&mdash;a lady's 
muscles, not an opera singer's.  And you are stiff&mdash; 
not so stiff as when you first came here, but stiff for a 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0366" n="353"/> 
professional.  Ah, we must go at this scientifically, 
thoroughly.'' 
</p><p>"You will teach me to breathe&mdash;and how to produce 
my voice naturally?'' 
</p><p>"I will teach you nothing,'' replied he.  "I will tell 
you what to do, and you will teach yourself.  You must 
get strong&mdash;strong in the supple way&mdash;and then you 
will sing as God intended.  The way to sing, dear 
young lady, is to sing.  Not to breathe artificially, and 
make faces, and fuss with your throat, but simply to 
drop your mouth and throat open and let it out!'' 
</p><p>Mildred produced from her hand-bag the Keith 
paper.  "What do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> think of that?'' she asked. 
</p><p>Presently he looked up from his reading.  "This 
part I have seen before,'' said he.  "It is Lucia Rivi's. 
Her cousin, Lotta Drusini, showed it to me&mdash;she was 
a great singer also.'' 
</p><p>"You approve of it?'' 
</p><p>"If you will follow that for two years, faithfully, 
you will be securely great, and then you will follow it 
all your singing life&mdash;and it will be long.  But 
remember, dear young lady, I said <hi rend="italic">if</hi> you follow it, 
and 
I said faithfully.  I do not believe you can.'' 
</p><p>"Why not?'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"Because that means self-denial, colossal self-denial. 
You love things to eat&mdash;yes?'' 
</p><p>Mildred nodded. 
</p><p>"We all do,'' said Moldini.  "And we hate routine, 
and we like foolish, aimless little pleasures of all kinds.'' 
</p><p>"And it will be two years before I can try grand 
opera&mdash;can make my living?'' said Mildred slowly. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0367" n="354"/>  
</p><p>"I did not say that.  I said, before you would be 
great.  No, you can sing, I think, in&mdash;wait.'' 
</p><p>Moldini flung rapidly through an enormous mass of 
music on a large table.  "Ah, here!'' he cried, and he 
showed her a manuscript of scales.  "Those two papers. 
It does not look much?  Well, I have made it 
up, myself.  And when you can sing those two papers 
perfectly, you will be a greater singer than any that 
ever lived.''  He laughed delightedly.  "Yes, it is all 
there&mdash;in two pages.  But do not weep, dear lady, 
because you will never sing them perfectly.  You will do 
very well if&mdash;  Always that if, remember!  Now, let 
us see.  Take this, sit in the chair, and begin.  Don't 
bother about me.  I expect nothing.  Just do the best 
you can.'' 
</p><p>Desperation, when it falls short of despair, is the 
best word for achievement.  Mildred's voice, especially 
at the outset, was far from perfect condition.  Her 
high notes, which had never been developed properly, 
were almost bad.  But she acquitted herself admirably 
from the standpoint of showing what her possibilities 
were.  And Moldini, unkempt, almost unclean, but as 
natural and simple and human a soul as ever paid the 
penalties of poverty and obscurity and friendlessness 
for being natural and simple and human, exactly suited 
her peculiar temperament.  She knew that he liked her, 
that he believed in her; she knew that he was as 
sympathetic toward her as her own self, that there was no 
meanness anywhere in him.  So she sang like a bird&mdash; 
a bird that was not too well in soul or in body, but still 
a bird out in the sunshine, with the airs of spring cheer-
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0368" n="355"/>       
ing his breast and its foliage gladdening his eyes.  He 
kept her at it for nearly an hour.  She saw that he 
was pleased, that he had thought out some plan and 
was bursting to tell her, but had forbidden himself to 
speak of it.  He said: 
</p><p>"You say you have no money?'' 
</p><p>"No, but I shall get it.'' 
</p><p>"You may have to pay high for it&mdash;yes?'' 
</p><p>She colored, but did not flinch.  "At worst, it will be 
&mdash;unpleasant, but that's all.'' 
</p><p>"Wait one&mdash;two days&mdash;until you hear from me. 
I may&mdash;I do not say will, but may&mdash;get it.  Yes, I 
who have nothing.''  He laughed gayly.  "And we&mdash; 
you and I&mdash;we will divide the spoils.''  Gravely.  "Do 
not misunderstand.  That was my little joke.  If I get 
the money for you it will be quite honorable and businesslike. 
So&mdash;wait, dear young lady.'' 
</p><p>As she was going, she could not resist saying: 
</p><p>"You are <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> I can sing?&mdash;<hi rend="italic">if</hi>, of course&mdash;always 
the if.'' 
</p><p>"It is not to be doubted.'' 
</p><p>"How well, do you think?'' 
</p><p>"You mean how many dollars a night well?  You 
mean as well as this great singer or that?  I do not 
know.  And you are not to compare yourself with anyone 
but yourself.  You will sing as well as Mildred 
Gower at her best.'' 
</p><p>For some reason her blood went tingling through her 
veins.  If she had dared she would have kissed him. </p>

<p>THAT same afternoon Donald Keith, arrived at the 
top of Mrs. Belloc's steps, met Mildred coming out. 
Seeing their greeting, one would have thought they had 
seen each other but a few minutes before or were casual 
acquaintances.  Said she: 
</p><p>"I'm going for a walk.'' 
</p><p>"Let's take the taxi,'' said he. 
</p><p>There it stood invitingly at the curb.  She felt tired. 
She disliked walking.  She wished to sit beside him and 
be whirled away&mdash;out of the noisy part of the city, up 
where the air was clean and where there were no crowds. 
But she had begun the regimen of Lucia Rivi.  She 
hesitated.  What matter if she began now or put off 
beginning until after this one last drive? 
</p><p>"No, we will walk,'' said she. 
</p><p>"But the streets are in frightful condition.'' 
</p><p>She thrust out a foot covered with a new and shiny 
storm-rubber. 
</p><p>"Let's drive to the park then.  We'll walk there.'' 
</p><p>"No.  If I get into the taxi, I'll not get out.  Send 
it away.'' 
</p><p>When they were moving afoot up Madison Avenue, 
he said:  "What's the matter?  This isn't like you.'' 
</p><p>"I've come to my senses,'' replied she.  "It may be 
too late, but I'm going to see.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0370" n="357"/> 
</p><p>"When I called on Mrs. Brindley the other day,'' 
said he, "she had your note, saying that you were going 
into musical comedy with Crossley.'' 
</p><p>"That's over,'' said she.  "I lost my voice, and I 
lost my job.'' 
</p><p>"So I heard,'' said he.  "I know Crossley.  I 
dropped in to see him this morning, and he told me 
about a foolish, fashionable girl who made a bluff at 
going on the stage&mdash;he said she had a good voice and 
was a swell looker, but proved to be a regular `four-flusher.' I recognized you.'' 
</p><p>"Thanks,'' said she dryly. 
</p><p>"So, I came to see you.'' 
</p><p>She inquired about Mrs. Brindley and then about 
Stanley Baird.  Finding that he was in Italy, she 
inquired:  "Do you happen to know his address?'' 
</p><p>"I'll get it and send it to you.  He has taken a house 
at Monte Carlo for the winter.'' 
</p><p>"And you?'' 
</p><p>"I shall stay here&mdash;I think.'' 
</p><p>"You may join him?'' 
</p><p>"It depends''&mdash;he looked at her&mdash;"upon you.'' 
</p><p>He could put a wonderful amount of meaning into a 
slight inflection.  She struggled&mdash;not in vain&mdash;to 
keep from changing expression. 
</p><p> "You realize now that the career is quite hopeless?'' 
said he. 
</p><p>She did not answer. 
</p><p>"You do not like the stage life?'' 
</p><p>"No.'' 
</p><p>"And the stage life does not like you?'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0371" n="358"/>
</p><p>"No.'' 
</p><p>"Your voice lacks both strength and stability?'' 
</p><p>"Yes.'' 
</p><p>"And you have found the one way by which you 
could get on&mdash;and you don't like it?'' 
</p><p>"Crossley told you?'' said she, the color flaring. 
</p><p>"Your name was not mentioned.  You may not 
believe it, but Crossley is a gentleman.'' 
</p><p>She walked on in silence. 
</p><p>"I did not expect your failure to come so soon&mdash;or 
in quite that way,'' he went on.  "I got Mrs. Brindley 
to exact a promise from you that you'd let her know 
about yourself.  I called on Mrs. Belloc one day when 
you were out, and gave her my confidence and got hers 
&mdash;and assured myself that you were in good hands. 
Crossley's tale gave me&mdash;a shock.  I came at once.'' 
</p><p>"Then you didn't abandon me to my fate, as I 
thought?'' 
</p><p>He smiled in his strange way.  "I?&mdash;when I loved 
you?  Hardly.'' 
</p><p>"Then you did interest yourself in me because you 
cared&mdash;precisely as I said,'' laughed she. 
</p><p>"And I should have given you up if you had 
succeeded&mdash;precisely as I said,'' replied he. 
</p><p>"You wished me to fail?'' 
</p><p>"I wished you to fail.  I did everything I could to 
help you to succeed.  I even left you absolutely alone, 
set you in the right way&mdash;the only way in which anyone 
can win success.'' 
</p><p>"Yes, you made me throw away the crutches and try 
to walk.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0372" n="359"/> 
</p><p>"It was hard to do that.  Those strains are very 
wearing at my time of life.'' 
</p><p>"You never were any younger, and you'll never be 
any older,'' laughed she.  "That's your charm&mdash;one 
of them.'' 
</p><p>"Mildred, do you still care?'' 
</p><p>"How did you know?'' inquired she mockingly. 
</p><p>"You didn't try to conceal it.  I'd not have ventured 
to say and do the things I said and did if I hadn't felt 
that we cared for each other.  But, so long as you were 
leading that fatuous life and dreaming those foolish 
dreams, I knew we could never be happy.'' 
</p><p>"That is true&mdash;oh, <hi rend="italic">so</hi> true,'' replied she. 
</p><p>"But now&mdash;you have tried, and that has made a 
woman of you.  And you have failed, and that has 
made you ready to be a wife&mdash;to be happy in the quiet, 
private ways.'' 
</p><p>She was silent. 
</p><p>"I can make enough for us both&mdash;as much as we 
will need or want&mdash;as much as you please, if you aren't 
too extravagant.  And I can do it easily.  It's making 
little sums&mdash;a small income&mdash;that's hard in this ridiculous 
world.  Let's marry, go to California or Europe 
for several months, then come back here and live like 
human beings.'' 
</p><p>She was silent.  Block after block they walked along, 
as if neither had anything especial in mind, anything 
worth the trouble of speech.  Finally he said: 
</p><p>"Well?'' 
</p><p>"I can't answer&mdash;yet,'' said she.  "Not to-day&mdash; 
not till I've thought.'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0373" n="360"/>
</p><p>She glanced quickly at him.  Over his impassive face, 
so beautifully regular and, to her, so fascinating, there 
passed a quick dark shadow, and she knew that he was 
suffering.  He laughed quietly, his old careless, 
indifferent laugh. 
</p><p>"Oh, yes, you can answer,'' said he.  "You have 
answered.'' 
</p><p>She drew in her breath sharply. 
</p><p>"You have refused.'' 
</p><p>"Why do you say that, Donald?'' she pleaded. 
</p><p>"To hesitate over a proposal is to refuse,'' said he 
with gentle raillery.  "A man is a fool who does not 
understand and sheer off when a woman asks for time.'' 
</p><p>"You know that I love you,'' she cried. 
</p><p>"I also know that you love something else more. 
But it's finished.  Let's talk about something else.'' 
</p><p>"Won't you let me tell you why I hesitate?'' begged 
she. 
</p><p>"It doesn't matter.'' 
</p><p>"But it does.  Yes, I do refuse, Donald.  I'll never 
marry you until I am independent.  You said a while 
ago that what I've been through had made a woman of 
me.  Not yet.  I'm only beginning.  I'm still weak&mdash; 
still a coward.  Donald, I must and will be free.'' 
</p><p>He looked full at her, with a strange smile in his 
brilliant eyes.  Said he, with obvious intent to change the 
subject:  "Mrs. Brindley's very unhappy that you 
haven't been to see her.'' 
</p><p>"When you asked me to marry you, the only reason 
I almost accepted was because I want someone to support 
me.  I love you&mdash;yes.  But it is as one loves 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0374" n="361"/>  
before one has given oneself and has lived the same 
life with another.  In the ordinary sense, it's love that 
I feel.  But&mdash;do you understand me, dearest?&mdash;in 
another sense, it's only the hope of love, the belief that 
love will come.'' 
</p><p>He stopped short and looked at her, his eyes alive with 
the stimulus of a new and startling idea. 
</p><p>"If you and I had been everything to each other, 
and you were saying `Let us go on living the one life' 
and I were hesitating, then you'd be right.  And I 
couldn't hesitate, Donald.  If you were mine, nothing 
could make me give you up, but when it's only the hope 
of having you, then pride and self-respect have a chance 
to be heard.'' 
</p><p>He was ready to move on.  "There's something in 
that,'' said he, lapsed into his usual seeming of 
impassiveness.  "But not much.'' 
</p><p>"I never before knew you to fail to understand.'' 
</p><p>"I understand perfectly.  You care, but you don't 
care enough to suit me.  I haven't waited all these years 
before giving a woman my love, to be content with a 
love seated quietly and demurely between pride and self-respect.'' 
</p><p>"You wouldn't marry me until I had failed,'' said 
she shrewdly.  "Now you attack me for refusing to 
marry you until I've succeeded.'' 
</p><p>A slight shrug.  "Proposal withdrawn,'' said he. 
"Now let's talk about your career, your plans.'' 
</p><p>"I'm beginning to understand myself a little,'' said 
she.  "I suppose you think that sort of personal talk 
is very silly and vain&mdash;and trivial.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0375" n="362"/>  
</p><p>"On the contrary,'' replied he, "it isn't absolutely 
necessary to understand oneself.  One is swept on in 
the same general direction, anyhow.  But understanding 
helps one to go faster and steadier.'' 
</p><p>"It began, away back, when I was a girl&mdash;this idea 
of a career.  I envied men and despised women, the 
sort of women I knew and met with.  I didn't realize 
why, then.  But it was because a man had a chance to 
be somebody in himself and to do something, while a 
woman was just a&mdash;a more or less ornamental 
belonging of some man's&mdash;what you want me to become 
now.'' 
</p><p>"As far as possible from my idea.'' 
</p><p>"Don't you want me to belong to you?'' 
</p><p>"As I belong to you.'' 
</p><p>"That sounds well, but it isn't what could happen. 
The fact is, Donald, that I want to belong to you&mdash; 
want to be owned by you and to lose myself in you. 
And it's that I'm fighting.'' 
</p><p>She felt the look he was bending upon her, and 
glowed and colored under it, but did not dare to turn 
her eyes to meet it.  Said he:  "Why fight it?  Why 
not be happy?'' 
</p><p>"Ah, but that's just it,'' cried she.  "I shouldn't 
be happy.  And I should make you miserable.  The 
idea of a career&mdash;the idea that's rooted deep in me 
and can't ever be got out, Donald; it would torment 
me.  You couldn't kill it, no matter how much you 
loved me.  I'd yield for the time.  Then, I'd go back&mdash; 
or, if I didn't, I'd be wretched and make you wish you'd 
never seen me.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0376" n="363"/> 
</p><p>"I understand,'' said he.  "I don't believe it, but I 
understand.'' 
</p><p>"You think I'm deceiving myself, because you saw me 
wasting my life, playing the idler and the fool, 
pretending I was working toward a career when I was 
really making myself fit for nothing but to be Stanley 
Baird's mistress.'' 
</p><p>"And you're still deceiving yourself.  You won't see 
the truth.'' 
</p><p>"No matter,'' said she.  "I must go on and make a 
career&mdash;some kind of a career.'' 
</p><p>"At what?'' 
</p><p>"At grand opera.'' 
</p><p>"How'll you get the money?'' 
</p><p>"Of Stanley, if necessary.  That's why I asked his 
address.  I shan't ask for much.  He'll not refuse.'' 
</p><p>"A few minutes ago you were talking of self-respect.'' 
</p><p>"As something I hoped to get.  It comes with 
independence.  I'll pay any price to get it.'' 
</p><p>"Any price?'' said he, and never before had she seen 
his self-control in danger. 
</p><p>"I shan't ask Stanley until my other plans have 
failed.'' 
</p><p>"What other plans?'' 
</p><p>"I am going to ask Mrs. Belloc for the money.  She 
could afford to give&mdash;to lend&mdash;the little I'd want. 
I'm going to ask her in such a way that it will be as 
hard as possible for her to refuse.  That isn't ladylike, 
but&mdash;I've dropped out of the lady class.'' 
</p><p>"And if she refuses?'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0377" n="364"/>
</p><p>"Then I'll go one after another to several very 
rich men I know, and ask them as a business proposition.'' 
</p><p>"Go in person,'' advised he with an undisguised sneer. 
</p><p>"I'll raise no false hopes in them,'' she said.  "If 
they choose to delude themselves, I'll not go out of my 
way to undeceive them&mdash;until I have to.'' 
</p><p>"So <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is Mildred Gower?'' 
</p><p>"You made that remark before.'' 
</p><p>"Really?'' 
</p><p>"When Stanley showed you a certain photograph of 
me.'' 
</p><p>"I remember.  This is the same woman.'' 
</p><p>"It's me,'' laughed she.  "The real me.  You'd not 
care to be married to her?'' 
</p><p>"No,'' said he.  Then, after a brief silence:  "Yet, 
curiously, it was that woman with whom I fell in love. 
No, not exactly in love, for I've been thinking about 
what you said as to the difference between love <hi rend="italic">in posse</hi> 
and love <hi rend="italic">in esse</hi>, to put it scientifically&mdash;between love 
as a prospect and love as a reality.'' 
</p><p>"And I was right,'' said she.  "It explains why 
marriages go to pieces and affairs come to grief.  Those 
lovers mistook love's promise to come for fulfillment. 
Love doesn't die.  It simply fails to come&mdash;doesn't 
redeem its promise.'' 
</p><p>"That's the way it might be with us,'' said he. 
"That's the way it would be with us,'' rejoined she. 
</p><p>He did not answer.  When they spoke again it was 
of indifferent matters.  An hour and a half after they 
started, they were at Mrs. Belloc's again.  She asked 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0378" n="365"/> 
him to have tea in the restaurant next door.  He 
declined.  He went up the steps with her, said: 
</p><p>"Well, I wish you luck.  Moldini is the best teacher 
in America.'' 
</p><p>"How did you know Moldini was to teach me?'' 
exclaimed she. 
</p><p>He smiled, put out his hand in farewell.  "Crossley 
told me.  Good-by.'' 
</p><p>"He told Crossley!  I wonder why.''  She was so 
interested in this new phase that she did not see his 
outstretched hand, or the look of bitter irony that came 
into his eyes at this proof of the subordinate place love 
and he had in her thoughts. 
</p><p>"I'm nervous and anxious,'' she said apologetically. 
"Moldini told me he had some scheme about getting 
the money.  If he only could!  But no such luck for 
me,'' she added sadly. 
</p><p>Keith hesitated, debated with himself, said:  "You 
needn't worry.  Moldini got it&mdash;from Crossley. 
Fifty dollars a week for a year.'' 
</p><p>"You got Crossley to do it?'' 
</p><p>"No.  He had done it before I saw him.  He had 
just promised Moldini and was cursing himself as `weak 
and soft.'  But that means nothing.  You may be sure 
he did it because Moldini convinced him it was a good 
speculation.'' 
</p><p>She was radiant.  She had not vanity enough where 
he was concerned to believe that he deeply cared, that her 
joy would give him pain because it meant forgetfulness 
of him.  Nor was she much impressed by the 
expression of his eyes.  And even as she hurt him, she 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0379" n="366"/> 
made him love her the more; for he appreciated how 
rare was the woman who, in such circumstances, does 
not feed her vanity with pity for the poor man suffering 
so horribly because he is not to get her precious 
self. 
</p><p>It flashed upon her why he had not offered to help 
her.  "There isn't anybody like you,'' said she, with no 
explanation of her apparent irrelevancy. 
</p><p>"Don't let Moldini see that you know,'' said he, with 
characteristic fine thoughtfulness for others in the midst 
of his own unhappiness.  "It would deprive him of a 
great pleasure.'' 
</p><p>He was about to go.  Suddenly her eyes filled and, 
opening the outer door, she drew him in.  "Donald,'' she 
said, "I love you.  Take me in your arms and make 
me behave.'' 
</p><p>He looked past her; his arms hung at his sides.  Said 
he:  "And to-night I'd get a note by messenger saying 
that you had taken it all back.  No, the girl in the 
photograph&mdash;that was you.  She wasn't made to be <hi rend="italic">my</hi> 
wife.  Or I to be her husband.  I love you because 
you are what you are.  I should not love you if you 
were the ordinary woman, the sort who marries and 
merges.  But I'm old enough to spare myself&mdash;and 
you&mdash;the consequences of what it would mean if we 
were anything but strangers to each other.'' 
</p><p>"Yes, you must keep away&mdash;altogether.  If you 
didn't, I'd be neither the one thing nor the other, but 
just a poor failure.'' 
</p><p>"You'll not fail,'' said he.  "I know it.  It's 
written in your face.''  He looked at her.  She was not 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0380" n="367"/> 
looking at him, but with eyes gazing straight ahead 
was revealing that latent, inexplicable power which, 
when it appeared at the surface, so strongly dominated 
and subordinated her beauty and her sex.  He shut his 
teeth together hard and glanced away. 
</p><p>"You will not fail,'' he repeated bitterly.  "And 
that's the worst of it.'' 
</p><p>Without another word, without a handshake, he went. 
And she knew that, except by chance, he would never 
see her again&mdash;or she him. 
</p><p>Moldini, disheveled and hysterical with delight and 
suspense, was in the drawing-room&mdash;had been there 
half an hour.  At first she could hardly force her mind 
to listen; but as he talked on and on, he captured her 
attention and held it. 
 
</p><p>The next day she began with Moldini, and put the 
Lucia Rivi system into force in all its more than 
conventual rigors.  And for about a month she worked 
like a devouring flame.  Never had there been such 
energy, such enthusiasm.  Mrs. Belloc was alarmed for 
her health, but the Rivi system took care of that; and 
presently Mrs. Belloc was moved to say, "Well, I've 
often heard that hard work never harmed anyone, but 
I never believed it.  Now I know the truth.'' 
</p><p>Then Mildred went to Hanging Rock to spend Saturday 
to Monday with her mother.  Presbury, reduced 
now by various infirmities&mdash;by absolute deafness, by 
dimness of sight, by difficulty in walking&mdash;to where 
eating was his sole remaining pleasure, or, indeed, 
distraction, spent all his time in concocting dishes for him-
   <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0381" n="368"/>      
self.  Mildred could not resist&mdash;and who can when 
seated at table with the dish before one's eyes and under 
one's nose.  The Rivi regimen was suspended for the 
visit.  Mildred, back in New York and at work again, 
found that she was apparently none the worse for her 
holiday, was in fact better.  So she drifted into the 
way of suspending the regimen for an evening now 
and then&mdash;when she dined with Mrs. Brindley, or when 
Agnes Belloc had something particularly good.  All 
went well for a time.  Then&mdash;a cold.  She neglected 
it, feeling sure it could not stay with one so soundly 
healthy through and through.  But it did stay; it 
grew worse.  She decided that she ought to take medicine 
for it.  True, starvation was the cure prescribed 
by the regimen, but Mildred could not bring herself to 
two or three days of discomfort.  Also, many people 
told her that such a cure was foolish and even dangerous. 
The cold got better, got worse, got better.  But 
her throat became queer, and at last her voice left her. 
She was ashamed to go to Moldini in such a condition. 
She dropped in upon Hicks, the throat specialist.  He 
"fixed her up'' beautifully with a few sprayings.  A 
week&mdash;and her voice left her again, and Hicks could 
not bring it back.  As she left his office, it was raining 
&mdash;an icy, dreary drizzle.  She splashed her way home, 
in about the lowest spirits she had ever known.  She 
locked her door and seated herself at the window and 
stared out, while the storm raged within her.  After 
an hour or two she wrote and sent Moldini a note: 
"I have been making a fool of myself.  I'll not come 
again until I am all right.  Be patient with me.  I 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0382" n="369"/>  
don't think this will occur again.''  She first wrote 
"happen.''  She scratched it out and put "occur'' in 
its place.  Not that Moldini would have noted the slip; 
simply that she would not permit herself the satisfaction 
of the false and self-excusing "happen.''  It had 
not been a "happen.''  It had been a deliberate folly, 
a lapse to the Mildred she had buried the day she 
sent Donald Keith away.  When the note was on its 
way, she threw out all her medicines, and broke the 
new spraying apparatus Hicks had instructed her to 
buy. 
</p><p>She went back to the Rivi r&eacute;gime.  A week passed, 
and she was little better.  Two weeks, and she began 
to mend.  But it was six weeks before the last traces of 
her folly disappeared.  Moldini said not a word, gave 
no sign.  Once more her life went on in uneventful, 
unbroken routine&mdash;diet, exercise, singing&mdash;singing, 
exercise, diet&mdash;no distractions except an occasional 
visit to the opera with Moldini, and she was hating 
opera now.  All her enthusiasm was gone.  She simply 
worked doggedly, drudged, slaved. 
</p><p>When the days began to grow warm, Mrs. Belloc said: 
"I suppose you'll soon be off to the country?  Are you 
going to visit Mrs. Brindley?'' 
</p><p>"No,'' said Mildred. 
</p><p>"Then come with me.'' 
</p><p>"Thank you, but I can't do it.'' 
</p><p>"But you've got to rest somewhere.'' 
</p><p>"Rest?'' said Mildred.  "Why should I rest?'' 
</p><p>Mrs. Belloc started to protest, then abruptly 
changed.  "Come to think of it, why should you? 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0383" n="370"/> 
You're in perfect health, and it'll be time enough to rest 
when you `get there.' '' 
</p><p>"I'm tired through and through,'' said Mildred, 
"but it isn't the kind of tired that could be rested 
except by throwing up this frightful nightmare of a 
career.'' 
</p><p>"And you can't do that.'' 
</p><p>"I won't,'' said Mildred, her lips compressed and her 
eyes narrowed. 
</p><p>She and Moldini&mdash;and fat, funny little Mrs. Moldini 
&mdash;went to the mountains.  And she worked on.  She 
would listen to none of the suggestions about the dangers 
of keeping too steadily at it, about working oneself 
into a state of staleness, about the imperative 
demands of the artistic temperament for rest, change, 
variety.  "It may be so,'' she said to Mrs. Brindley. 
"But I've gone mad.  I can no more drop this routine 
than&mdash;than you could take it up and keep to it for a 
week.'' 
</p><p>"I'll admit I couldn't,'' said Cyrilla.  "And 
Mildred, you're making a mistake.'' 
</p><p>"Then I'll have to suffer for it.  I must do what 
seems best to me.'' 
</p><p>"But I'm sure you're wrong.  I never knew anyone 
to act as you're acting.  Everyone rests and freshens 
up.'' 
</p><p>Mildred lost patience, almost lost her temper. 
"You're trying to tempt me to ruin myself,'' she said. 
"Please stop it.  You say you never knew anyone to 
do as I'm doing.  Very well.  But how many girls 
have you known who have succeeded?'' 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0384" n="371"/> 
</p><p>Cyrilla hesitatingly confessed that she had known 
none. 
</p><p>"Yet you've known scores who've tried.'' 
</p><p>"But they didn't fail because they didn't work enough. 
Many of them worked too much.'' 
</p><p>Mildred laughed.  "How do you know why they 
failed?'' said she.  "You haven't thought about it as 
I have.  You haven't <hi rend="italic">lived</hi> it.  Cyrilla, I served 
my 
apprenticeship at listening to nonsense about careers. 
I want to have nothing to do with inspiration, and 
artistic temperament, and spontaneous genius, and all 
the rest of the lies.  Moldini and I know what we are 
about.  So I'm living as those who have succeeded lived 
and not as those who have failed.'' 
</p><p>Cyrilla was silenced, but not convinced.  The 
amazing improvement in Mildred's health, the splendid slim 
strength and suppleness of her body, the new and stable 
glories of her voice&mdash;all these she knew about, but they 
did not convince her.  She believed in work, in hard 
work, but to her work meant the music itself.  She felt 
that the Rivi system and the dirty, obscure little Moldini 
between them were destroying Mildred by destroying 
all "temperament'' in her. 
</p><p>It was the old, old criticism of talent upon genius. 
Genius has always won in its own time and generation 
all the world except talent.  To talent contemporaneous 
genius, genius seen at its patient, plodding toil, 
seems coarse and obvious and lacking altogether in 
inspiration.  Talent cannot comprehend that creation 
is necessarily in travail and in all manner of unloveliness. 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0385" n="372"/>  
</p><p>Mildred toiled on like a slave under the lash, and 
Moldini and the Rivi system were her twin relentless 
drivers.  She learned to rule herself with an iron hand. 
She discovered the full measure of her own deficiencies, 
and she determined to make herself a competent lyric 
soprano, perhaps something of a dramatic soprano. 
She dismissed from her mind all the "high'' thoughts, 
all the dreams wherewith the little people, even the 
little people who achieve a certain success, beguile the 
tedium of their journey along the hard road.  She was 
not working to "interpret the thought of the great 
master'' or to "advance the singing art yet higher'' or 
even to win fame and applause.  She had one object 
&mdash;to earn her living on the grand opera stage, and 
to earn it as a prima donna because that meant the best 
living.  She frankly told Cyrilla that this was her 
object, when Cyrilla forced her one day to talk about her 
aims.  Cyrilla looked pained, broke a melancholy silence 
to say: 
</p><p>"I know you don't mean that.  You are too 
intelligent.  You sing too well.'' 
</p><p>"Yes, I mean just that,'' said Mildred.  "A living.'' 
</p><p>"At any rate, don't say it.  You give such a false 
impression.'' 
</p><p>"To whom?  Not to Crossley, and not to Moldini, 
and why should I care what any others think?  They 
are not paying my expenses.  And regardless of what 
they think now, they'll be at my feet if I succeed, and 
they'll put me under theirs if I don't.'' 
</p><p>"How hard you have grown,'' cried Cyrilla. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0386" n="373"/>
</p><p>"How sensible, you mean.  I've merely stopped 
being a self-deceiver and a sentimentalist.'' 
</p><p>"Believe me, my dear, you are sacrificing your 
character to your ambition.'' 
</p><p>"I never had any real character until ambition came,'' 
replied Mildred.  "The soft, vacillating, sweet and 
weak thing I used to have wasn't character.'' 
</p><p>"But, dear, you can't think it superior character to 
center one's whole life about a sordid ambition.'' 
</p><p>"Sordid?'' 
</p><p>"Merely to make a living.'' 
</p><p>Mildred laughed merrily and mockingly.  "You call 
that sordid?  Then for heaven's sake what is high? 
You had left you money enough to live on, if you have 
to.  No one left me an income.  So, I'm fighting for 
independence&mdash;and that means for self-respect.  Is 
self-respect sordid, Cyrilla!'' 
</p><p>And then Cyrilla understood&mdash;in part, not altogether. 
She lived in the ordinary environment of flap-doodle and sweet hypocrisy and sentimentality; and 
none such can more than vaguely glimpse the realities. 
</p><p>Toward the end of the summer Moldini said: 
</p><p>"It's over.  You have won.'' 
</p><p>Mildred looked at him in puzzled surprise. 
</p><p>"You have learned it all.  You will succeed.  The 
rest is detail.'' 
</p><p>"But I've learned nothing as yet,'' protested she. 
</p><p>"You have learned to teach yourself,'' replied the 
Italian.  "You at last can hear yourself sing, and you 
know when you sing right and when you sing wrong, 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0387" n="374"/> 
and you know how to sing right.  The rest is easy. 
Ah, my dear Miss Gower, you will work <hi rend="italic">now!</hi>'' 
</p><p>Mildred did not understand.  She was even daunted by 
that "You will work <hi rend="italic">now!</hi>''  She had been thinking 
that to work harder was impossible.  What did he expect 
of her?  Something she feared she could not realize. 
But soon she understood&mdash;when he gave her songs, 
then began to teach her a r&ocirc;le, the part of Madame 
Butterfly herself.  "I can help you only a little there,'' 
he said.  "You will have to go to my friend Ferreri 
for r&ocirc;les.  But we can make a beginning.'' 
</p><p>She had indeed won.  She had passed from the stage 
where a career is all drudgery&mdash;the stage through 
which only the strong can pass without giving up and 
accepting failure or small success.  She had passed 
to the stage where there is added pleasure to the drudgery, 
for, the drudgery never ceases.  And what was the 
pleasure?  Why, more work&mdash;always work&mdash;bringing 
into use not merely the routine parts of the mind, 
but also the imaginative and creative faculties.  She 
had learned her trade&mdash;not well enough, for no 
superior man or woman ever feels that he or she knows 
the trade well enough&mdash;but well enough to begin to use 
it. 
</p><p>Said Moldini:  "When the great one, who has 
achieved and arrived, is asked for advice by the sweet, 
enthusiastic young beginner, what is the answer? 
Always the same:  `My dear child, don't!  Go back 
home, and marry and have babies.'  You know why 
now?'' 
</p><p>And Mildred, looking back over the dreary drudgery 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0388" n="375"/>   
that had been, and looking forward to the drudgery 
yet to come, dreary enough for all the prospects of a 
few flowers and a little sun&mdash;Mildred said:  "Indeed 
I do, <hi rend="italic">maestro</hi>.'' 
</p><p>"They think it means what you Americans call 
morals&mdash;as if that were all of morality!  But it doesn't 
mean morals; not at all.  Sex and the game of sex is 
all through life everywhere&mdash;in the home no less than 
in the theater.  In town and country, indoors and out, 
sunlight, moonlight, and rain&mdash;always it goes on. 
And the temptations and the struggles are no more and 
no less on the stage than off.  No, there is too much 
talk about `morals.'  The reason the great one says 
`don't' is the work.''  He shook his head sadly. 
"They do not realize, those eager young beginners. 
They read the story-books and the lives of the great 
successes and they hear the foolish chatter of common-place people&mdash;those imbecile `cultured' people who 
know nothing!  And they think a career is a triumphal 
march.  What think you, Miss Gower&mdash;eh?'' 
</p><p>"If I had known I'd not have had the courage, or 
the vanity, to begin,'' said she.  "And if I could 
realize what's before me, I probably shouldn't have the 
courage to go on.'' 
</p><p>"But why not?  Haven't you also learned that it's 
just the day's work, doing every day the best you can?'' 
</p><p>"Oh, I shall go on,'' rejoined she. 
</p><p>"Yes,'' said he, looking at her with awed admiration. 
"It is in your face.  I saw it there, the day you 
came&mdash;after you sang the `Batti Batti' the first time 
and failed.'' 
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0389" n="376"/> 
</p><p>"There was nothing to me then.'' 
</p><p>"The seed,'' replied he.  "And I saw it was an acorn, 
not the seed of one of those weak plants that spring 
up overnight and wither at noon.  Yes, you will win.'' 
He laughed gayly, rolled his eyes and kissed his fingers. 
"And then you can afford to take a little holiday, and 
fall in love.  Love!  Ah, it is a joyous pastime&mdash; 
for a holiday.  Only for a holiday, mind you.  I shall 
be there and I shall seize you and take you back to your 
art.'' 
</p><p>In the following winter and summer Crossley 
disclosed why he had been sufficiently interested in grand 
opera to begin to back undeveloped voices.  Crossley 
was one of those men who are never so practical as 
when they profess to be, and fancy themselves, impractical. 
He became a grand-opera manager and organized 
for a season that would surpass in interest any 
New York had known.  Thus it came about that on a 
March night Mildred made her d&eacute;but. 
</p><p>The opera was "Faust.''  As the three principal 
men singers were all expensive&mdash;the tenor alone, 
twelve hundred a night&mdash;Crossley put in a comparatively 
modestly salaried Marguerite.  She was seized 
with a cold at the last moment, and Crossley ventured to 
substitute Mildred Gower.  The Rivi system was still in 
force.  She was ready&mdash;indeed, she was always ready, 
as Rivi herself had been.  And within ten minutes of 
her coming forth from the wings, Mildred Gower had 
leaped from obscurity into fame.  It happens so, often 
in the story books, the newly gloriously arrived one 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0390" n="377"/>
having been wholly unprepared, achieving by sheer force 
of genius.  It occurs so, occasionally, in life&mdash;never 
when there is lack of preparation, never by force of 
unassisted genius, never by accident.  Mildred 
succeeded because she had got ready to succeed.  How could 
she have failed? 
</p><p>Perhaps you read the stories in the newspapers&mdash; 
how she had discovered herself possessed of a marvelous 
voice, how she had decided to use it in public, how 
she had coached for a part, had appeared, had become 
one of the world's few hundred great singers all in a 
single act of an opera.  You read nothing about what 
she went through in developing a hopelessly uncertain 
and far from strong voice into one which, while not 
nearly so good as thousands of voices that are tried 
and cast aside, yet sufficed, with her will and her 
concentration back of it, to carry her to fame&mdash;and 
wealth. 
</p><p>That birdlike voice!  So sweet and spontaneous, so 
true, so like the bird that "sings of summer in full 
throated ease!''  No wonder the audience welcomed it 
with cheers on cheers.  Greater voices they had heard, 
but none more natural&mdash;and that was Moldini. 
</p><p>He came to her dressing-room at the intermission. 
He stretched out his arms, but emotion overcame him, 
and he dropped to a chair and sobbed and cried and 
laughed.  She came and put her arms round him and 
kissed him.  She was almost calm.  The <hi rend="italic">great</hi> fear 
had 
seized her&mdash;Can I keep what I have won? 
</p><p>"I am a fool,'' cried Moldini.  "I will agitate you.'' 
</p><p>"Don't be afraid of that,'' said she.  "I am nerv-
<pb entity="DSSR_000001482_0391" n="378"/>         
ous, yes, horribly nervous.  But you have taught me 
so that I could sing, no matter what was happening.'' 
It was true.  And her body was like iron to the 
touch. 
</p><p>He looked at her, and though he knew her and had 
seen her train herself and had helped in it, he marveled. 
"You are happy?'' he said eagerly.  "Surely&mdash;yes, 
you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be happy.'' 
</p><p>"More than that,'' answered she.  "You'll have to 
find another word than happiness&mdash;something bigger 
and stronger and deeper.'' 
</p><p>"Now you can have your holiday,'' laughed he. 
"But''&mdash;with mock sternness&mdash;"in moderation!  He 
must be an incident only.  With those who win the high 
places, sex is an incident&mdash;a charming, necessary 
incident, but only an incident.  He must not spoil your 
career.  If you allowed that you would be like a mother 
who deserts her children for a lover.  He must not 
touch your career!'' 
</p><p>Mildred, giving the last touches to her costume before 
the glass, glanced merrily at Moldini by way of it. 
"If he did touch it,'' said she, "how long do you think 
he would last with me?'' 
</p><p>Moldini paused half-way in his nod of approval, was 
stricken with silence and sadness.  It would have been 
natural and proper for a man thus to put sex beneath 
the career.  It was necessary for anyone who developed 
the strong character that compels success and 
holds it.  But&mdash;  The Italian could not get away from 
tradition; woman was made for the pleasure of one 
man, not for herself and the world. 

</p><p>"You don't like that, <hi rend="italic">maestro</hi>?'' said she, still 
observing him in the glass. 
</p><p>"No man would,'' said he, with returning 
cheerfulness.  "It hurts man's vanity.  And no woman would, 
either; you rebuke their laziness and their dependence!'' 
</p><p>She laughed and rushed away to fresh triumphs.</p>
