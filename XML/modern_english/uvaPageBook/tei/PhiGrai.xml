Lockyer &amp; Norman, corporation lawyers, there drifted 
on a December afternoon a girl in search of work at 
stenography and typewriting. The firm was about the 
most important and most famous   &mdash;   radical orators often 
said infamous   &mdash;   in New York. The girl seemed, at a 
glance, about as unimportant and obscure an atom as 
the city hid in its vast ferment. She was blonde   &mdash;   tawny 
hair, fair skin, blue eyes. Aside from this hardly 
conclusive mark of identity there was nothing positive, 
nothing definite, about her. She was neither tall nor 
short, neither fat nor thin, neither grave nor gay. She 
gave the impression of a young person of the feminine 
gender   &mdash;   that, and nothing more. She was plainly 
dressed, like thousands of other girls, in darkish blue 
jacket and skirt and white shirt waist. Her boots and 
gloves were neat, her hair simply and well arranged. 
Perhaps in these respects   &mdash;   in neatness and taste   &mdash;   she 
did excel the average, which is depressingly low. But 
in a city where more or less strikingly pretty women, 
bent upon being seen, are as plentiful as the blackberries 
of Kentucky's July   &mdash;   in New York no one would 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0015" n="2"/>  
have given her a second look, this quiet young woman 
screened in an atmosphere of self-effacement. 
</p><p>She applied to the head clerk. It so happened that 
need for another typewriter had just arisen. She got 
a trial, showed enough skill to warrant the modest wage 
of ten dollars a week; she became part of the office force 
of twenty or twenty-five young men and women similarly 
employed. As her lack of skill was compensated by 
industry and regularity, she would have a job so long 
as business did not slacken. When it did, she would 
be among the first to be let go. She shrank into her 
obscure niche in the great firm, came and went in mouse-like fashion, said little, obtruded herself never, was all 
but forgotten. 
</p><p>Nothing could have been more commonplace, more 
trivial than the whole incident. The name of the girl 
was Hallowell   &mdash;   Miss Hallowell. On the chief clerk's 
pay roll appeared the additional information that her 
first name was Dorothea. The head office boy, in one 
of his occasional spells of &ldquo;freshness,&rdquo; addressed her 
as Miss Dottie. She looked at him with a puzzled 
expression; it presently changed to a slight, sweet smile, 
and she went about her business. There was no rebuke 
in her manner, she was far too self-effacing for anything 
so positive as the mildest rebuke. But the head 
office boy blushed awkwardly   &mdash;   why he did not know and 
could not discover, though he often cogitated upon it. 
She remained Miss Hallowell.</p> 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0016" n="3"/>  
<p>Opposites suggest each other. The dimmest personality 
in those offices was the girl whose name imaged to 
everyone little more than a pencil, notebook, and 
typewriting machine. The vividest personality was Frederick 
Norman. In the list of names upon the outer doors of the 
firm's vast labyrinthine suite, on the seventeenth floor 
of the Syndicate Building, his name came last   &mdash;   and, 
in the newest lettering, suggesting recentness of 
partnership. In age he was the youngest of the partners. 
Lockyer was archaic, Sanders an antique; Benchley, 
actually only about fifty-five, had the air of one born 
in the grandfather class. Lockyer the son dyed his 
hair and affected jauntiness, but was in fact not many 
years younger than Benchley and had the stiffening 
jerky legs of one paying for a lively youth. Norman 
was thirty-seven   &mdash;   at the age the Greeks extolled as 
divine because it means all the best of youth combined 
with all the best of manhood. Some people thought 
Norman younger, almost boyish. Those knew him uptown 
only, where he hid the man of affairs beneath the 
man of the world-that-amuses-itself. Some people 
thought he looked, and was, older than the age with 
which the biographical notices credited him. They knew 
him down town only   &mdash;   where he dominated by sheer force 
of intellect and will. 
</p><p>As has been said, the firm ranked among the greatest 
in New York. It was a trusted counselor in large 
affairs   &mdash;   commercial, financial, political   &mdash;   in all parts of 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0017" n="4"/>  
America, in all parts of the globe, for many of its 
clients were international traffickers. Yet this young 
man, this youngest and most recent of the partners, 
had within the month forced a reorganization of the 
firm   &mdash;   or, rather, of its profits   &mdash;   on a basis that gave him 
no less than one half of the whole. 
</p><p>His demand threw his four associates into paroxysms 
of rage and fear   &mdash;   the fear serving as a wholesome antidote 
to the rage. 
</p><p>It certainly was infuriating that a youth, admitted 
to partnership barely three years ago, should thus 
maltreat his associates. Ingrate was precisely the epithet 
for him. At least, so they honestly thought, after the 
quaint human fashion; for, because they had given him 
the partnership, they looked on themselves as his 
benefactors, and neglected as unimportant detail the sole 
and entirely selfish reason for their graciousness. But 
enraged though these worthy gentlemen were, and 
eagerly though they longed to treat the &ldquo;conceited 
and grasping upstart&rdquo; as he richly deserved, they 
accepted his ultimatum. Even the venerable and 
veneerated Lockyer   &mdash;   than whom a more convinced self-deceiver on the subject of his own virtues never wore 
white whiskers, black garments, and the other badges 
of eminent respectability   &mdash;   even old Joseph Lockyer 
could not twist the acceptance into another manifestation 
of the benevolence of himself and his associates. 
They had to stare the grimacing truth straight in the 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0018" n="5"/>  
face; they were yielding because they dared not refuse. 
To refuse would mean the departure of Norman with 
the firm's most profitable business. It costs heavily to 
live in New York; the families of successful men are 
extravagant; so conduct unbecoming a gentleman may 
not there be resented if to resent is to cut down one's 
income. The time was, as the dignified and nicely 
honorable Sanders observed, when these and many similar 
low standards did not prevail in the legal profession. 
But such is the frailty of human nature   &mdash;   or so savage 
the pressure of the need of the material necessities of 
civilized life, let a profession become profitable or 
develop possibilities of profit   &mdash;   even the profession of 
statesman, even that of lawyer   &mdash;   or doctor   &mdash;   or priest   &mdash;    
or wife   &mdash;   and straightway it begins to tumble down 
toward the brawl and stew of the market place. 
</p><p>In a last effort to rouse the gentleman in Norman 
or to shame him into pretense of gentlemanliness, Lockyer 
expostulated with him like a prophet priest in full 
panoply of saintly virtue. And Lockyer was passing 
good at that exalted gesture. He was a Websterian 
figure, with the venality of the great Daniel in all its 
pompous dignity modernized   &mdash;   and correspondingly 
expanded. He abounded in those idealist sonorosities that 
are the stock-in-trade of all solemn old-fashioned frauds. 
The young man listened with his wonted attentive 
courtesy until the dolorous appeal disguised as fatherly 
counsel came to an end. Then in his blue-gray eyes 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0019" n="6"/>  
appeared the gleam that revealed the tenacity and the 
penetration of his mind. He said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Lockyer, you have been absent six years   &mdash;    
except an occasional two or three weeks   &mdash;   absent as 
American Ambassador to France. You have done nothing 
for the firm in that time. Yet you have not scorned to 
take profits you did not earn. Why should I scorn to 
take profits I do earn?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Mr. Lockyer shook his picturesque head in sad 
remonstrance at this vulgar, coarse, but latterly frequent 
retort of insurgent democracy upon indignant aristocracy. 
But he answered nothing. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Also,&rdquo; proceeded the graceless youth in the clear 
and concise way that won the instant attention of juries 
and Judges, &ldquo;also, our profession is no longer a profession 
but a business.&rdquo;  His humorous eyes twinkled merrily. 
&ldquo;It divides into two parts   &mdash;   teaching capitalists 
how to loot without being caught, and teaching them 
how to get off if by chance they have been caught. 
There are other branches of the profession, but they're 
not lucrative, so we do not practice them. Do I make 
myself clear?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Mr. Lockyer again shook his head and sighed. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I am not an Utopian,&rdquo; continued young Norman. 
&ldquo;Law and custom permit   &mdash;   not to say sanctify   &mdash;   our 
sort of business. So   &mdash;   I do my best. But I shall not 
conceal from you that it's distasteful to me. I wish to 
get out of it. I shall get out as soon as I've made enough 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0020" n="7"/>  
capital to assure me the income I have and need. Naturally, 
I wish to gather in the necessary amount as 
speedily as possible.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Fred, my boy, I regret that you take such low 
views of our noble profession.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   as a profession it is noble. But not as a 
practice. <hi rend="italic">My</hi> regret is that it 
invites and compels such 
low views.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You will look at these things more   &mdash;   more mellowly 
when you are older.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I doubt if I'll ever rise very high in the art of 
self-deception,&rdquo; replied Norman. &ldquo;If I'd had any bent 
that way I'd not have got so far so quickly.&rdquo; 
</p><p>It was a boastful remark   &mdash;   of a kind he, and other 
similar young men, have the habit of making. But 
from him it did not sound boastful   &mdash;   simply a frank 
and timely expression of an indisputable truth, which 
indeed it was. Once more Mr. Lockyer sighed. &ldquo;I see 
you are incorrigible,&rdquo; said he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I have not acted without reflection,&rdquo; said Norman. 
</p><p>And Lockyer knew that to persist was simply to 
endanger his dignity. &ldquo;I am getting old,&rdquo; said he. 
&ldquo;Indeed, I am old. I have gotten into the habit of 
leaning on you, my boy. I can't consent to your going, 
hard though you make it for us to keep you. I shall 
try to persuade our colleagues to accept your terms.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman showed neither appreciation nor triumph. 
He merely bowed slightly. And so the matter was 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0021" n="8"/>  
settled. Instead of moving into the suite of offices in 
the Mills Building on which he had taken an option, 
young Norman remained where he had been toiling for 
twelve years. 
</p><p>After this specimen of Norman's quality, no one 
will be surprised to learn that in figure he was one of 
those solidly built men of medium height who look as 
if they were made to sustain and to deliver shocks, to 
bear up easily under heavy burdens; or that his head 
thickly covered with fairish hair, was hatchet-shaped 
with the helve or face suggesting that while it could 
and would cleave any obstacle, it would wear a merry 
if somewhat sardonic smile the while. No one had ever 
seen Norman angry, though a few persevering offenders 
against what he regarded as his rights had felt 
the results of swift and powerful action of the same 
sort that is usually accompanied   &mdash;   and weakened   &mdash;   by 
outward show of anger. Invariably good-humored, he 
was soon seen to be more dangerous than the men of 
flaring temper. In most instances good humor of thus 
unbreakable species issues from weakness, from a desire 
to conciliate   &mdash;   usually with a view to plucking the more 
easily. Norman's good humor arose from a sense of 
absolute security which in turn was the product of 
confidence in himself and amiable disdain for his fellow men. 
The masses he held in derision for permitting the classes 
to rule and rob and spit upon them. The classes he 
scorned for caring to occupy themselves with so cheap 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0022" n="9"/>  
and sordid a game as the ruling, robbing, and spitting 
aforesaid. Coming down to the specific, he despised 
men as individuals because he had always found in each 
and everyone of them a weakness that made it easy for 
him to use them as he pleased. 
</p><p>Not an altogether pleasant character, this. But 
not so unpleasant as it may seem to those unable 
impartially to analyze human character, even their own   &mdash;    
especially their own. And let anyone who is disposed 
to condemn Norman first look within himself   &mdash;   in some 
less hypocritical and self-deceiving moment, if he have 
such moments   &mdash;   and let him note what are the qualities 
he relies upon and uses in his own struggle to save 
himself from being submerged and sunk. Further, 
there were in Norman many agreeable qualities, 
important, but less fundamental, therefore less deep-hidden   &mdash;   therefore generally regarded as the real man and 
as the cause of his success in which they in fact had 
almost no part. He was, for example, of striking 
physical appearance, was attractively dressed and 
mannered, was prodigally generous. Neither as lawyer nor 
as man did he practice justice. But while as lawyer he 
practiced injustice, as man he practiced mercy. Whenever 
a weakling appealed to him for protection, he gave 
it   &mdash;   at times with splendid recklessness as to the cost 
to himself in antagonisms and enmities. Indeed, so 
great were the generosities of his character that, had 
he not been arrogant, disdainful, self-confident, resolutely 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0023" n="10"/>  
and single-heartedly ambitious, he must inevitably 
have ruined himself   &mdash;   if he had ever been able to 
rise high enough to be worthy the dignity of catastrophe. 
</p><p>Successful men are usually trying persons to know 
well. Lambs, asses, and chickens do not associate 
happily with lions, wolves, and hawks   &mdash;   nor do birds and 
beasts of prey get on well with one another. Norman 
was regarded as &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; by his friends   &mdash;   by those 
of them who happened to get into the path of his ambition, 
in front of instead of behind him, and by those 
who fell into the not unnatural error of misunderstanding 
his good nature and presuming upon it. His clients 
regarded him as insolent. The big businesses, seeking the 
rich spoils of commerce, frequent highly perilous waters. 
They need skillful pilots. Usually these lawyer-pilots 
&ldquo;know their place&rdquo; and put on no airs upon the 
quarter-deck while they are temporarily in command. 
Not so Norman. He took the full rank, authority   &mdash;    
and emoluments   &mdash;   of commander. And as his power, 
fame, and income were swiftly growing, it is fair to 
assume that he knew what he was about. 
</p><p>He was admired   &mdash;   extravagantly admired   &mdash;   by young 
men with not too broad a vein of envy. He was no 
woman hater   &mdash;   anything but that. Indeed, those who 
wished him ill had from time to time hoped to see him 
tumble down, through miscalculation in some of his 
audacities with women. No   &mdash;   he did not hate women. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0024" n="11"/>  
But there were several women who hated him   &mdash;   or tried 
to; and if wounded vanity and baffled machination be 
admitted as just causes for hatred, they had cause. He 
liked   &mdash;   but he did not wholly trust. When he went to 
sleep, it was not where Delilah could wield the shears. 
A most irritating prudence   &mdash;   irritating to friends and 
intimates of all degrees and kinds, in a race of beings 
with a mania for being trusted implicitly but with no 
balancing mania for deserving trust of the implicit 
variety. 
</p><p>And he ate hugely   &mdash;   and whatever he pleased. He 
could drink beyond belief, all sorts of things, with no 
apparent ill effect upon either body or brain. He had 
all the appetites developed abnormally, and abnormal 
capacity for gratifying them. Where there was one 
man who envied him his eminence, there were a dozen 
who envied him his physical capacities. We cannot live 
and act without doing mischief, as well as that which 
most of us would rather do, provided that in the doing 
we are not ourselves undone. Probably in no direction 
did Norman do so much mischief as in unconsciously 
leading men of his sets down town and up to imitate 
his colossal dissipations   &mdash;   which were not dissipation for 
him who was abnormal. 
</p><p>Withal, he was a monster for work. There is not 
much truth in men's unending talk of how hard they 
work or are worked. The ravages from their indulgences 
in smoking, drinking, gallantry, eating too much 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0025" n="12"/>  
and too fast and too often, have to be explained away 
creditably, to themselves and to others   &mdash;   notably to the 
wives or mothers who nurse them and suffer from their 
diminishing incomes. Hence the wailing about work. 
But once in a while a real worker appears   &mdash;   a man with 
enormous ingenuity at devising difficult tasks for 
himself and with enormous persistence in doing them. 
Frederick Norman was one of these blue-moon prodigies. 
</p><p>Obviously, such a man could not but be observed 
and talked about. Endless stories, some of them more 
or less true, most of them apocryphal, were told of him 
   &mdash;   stories of his shrewd, unexpected moves in big cases, 
of his witty retorts, of his generosities, of his peculiarities 
of dress, of eating and drinking; stories of his 
adventures with women. Whatever he did, however trivial, 
took color and charm from his personality, so easy 
yet so difficult, so simple yet so complex, so baffling. 
Was he wholly selfish?  Was he a friend to almost anybody 
or to nobody?  Did he ever love?  No one knew, 
not even himself, for life interested him too intensely 
and too incessantly to leave him time for self-analysis. 
One thing he was certain of; he hated nobody, envied 
nobody. He was too successful for that. 
</p><p>He did as he pleased. And, on the whole, he pleased 
to do far less inconsiderately than his desires, his 
abilities, and his opportunities tempted. Have not men 
been acclaimed good for less? 
</p><p>In the offices, where he was canvased daily by partners, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0026" n="13"/>  
clerks, everyone down to the cleaners whose labors 
he so often delayed, opinion varied from day to day. 
They worshiped him; they hated him. They loved 
him; they feared him. They regarded him as more than 
human, as less than human; but never as just human   &mdash;    
though always as endowed with fine human virtues and 
even finer human weaknesses. Miss Tillotson, next to 
the head clerk in rank and pay   &mdash;   and a pretty and 
pushing young person   &mdash;   dreamed of getting acquainted 
with him   &mdash;   really well acquainted. It was a vain dream. 
For him, between up town and down town a great gulf-was fixed. Also, he had no interest in or ammunition 
for sparrows. 
</p><p>It was in December that Miss Hallowell   &mdash;   Miss Dorothea 
Hallowell   &mdash;   got her temporary place at ten dollars 
a week   &mdash;   that obscure event, somewhat like a 
field mouse taking quarters in a horizon-bounded grain 
field. It was not until mid-February that she, the 
palest of personalities, came into direct contact with 
Norman, about the most refulgent. This is how it 
happened. 
</p><p>Late in that February afternoon, an hour or more 
after the last of the office force should have left, 
Norman threw open the door of his private office and glanced 
round at the rows on rows of desks. The lights in the 
big room were on, apparently only because he was still 
within. With an exclamation of disappointment he 
turned to re&euml;nter his office. He heard the click of typewriter 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0027" n="14"/>  
keys. Again he looked round, but could see 
no one. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Isn't there some one here?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Don't I 
hear a typewriter?&rdquo; 
</p><p>The noise stopped. There was a slight rustling 
from a far corner, beyond his view, and presently he 
saw advancing a slim and shrinking slip of a girl with 
a face that impressed him only as small and insignificant. 
In a quiet little voice she said, &ldquo;Yes, sir. Do you wish 
anything?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why, what are you doing here?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I 
don't think I've ever seen you before.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. I took dictation from you several times,&rdquo; 
replied she. 
</p><p>He was instantly afraid he might have hurt her feelings, 
and he, who in the days when he was far, far less 
than now, had often suffered from that commonplace 
form of brutality, was most careful not to commit it. 
&ldquo;I never know what's going on round me when I'm 
thinking,&rdquo; explained he, though he was saying to himself 
that the next time he would probably again be 
unable to remember one with nothing distinctive to fix 
identity. &ldquo;You are   &mdash;   Miss   &mdash;      &mdash;   ?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Hallowell.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;How do you happen to be here?  I've given 
particular instructions that no one is ever to be detained 
after hours.&rdquo; 
</p><p>A little color appeared in the pale, small face   &mdash;   and 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0028" n="15"/>  
now he saw that she had a singularly fair and smooth 
skin, singularly beautiful   &mdash;   and he wondered why he had 
not noticed it before. Being a close observer, he had 
long ago noted and learned to appreciate the wonders of 
that most amazing of tissues, the human skin; and he 
had come to be a connoisseur. &ldquo;I'm staying of my 
own accord,&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;They ought not to give you so much work,&rdquo; said 
he. &ldquo;I'll speak about it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Into the small face came the look of the frightened 
child   &mdash;   a fascinating look. And suddenly he saw that 
she had lovely eyes, clear, expressive, innocent. &ldquo;Please 
don't,&rdquo; she pleaded, in the gentle quiet voice. &ldquo;It isn't 
overwork. I did a brief so badly that I was ashamed 
to hand it in. I'm doing it again.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He laughed, and a fine frank laugh he had when 
he was in the mood. At once a smile lighted up her 
face, danced in her eyes, hovered bewitchingly about 
her lips   &mdash;   and he wondered why he had not at first 
glance noted how sweet and charmingly fresh her mouth 
was. &ldquo;Why, she's beautiful,&rdquo; he said to himself, the 
manly man's inevitable interest in feminine charm wide 
awake. &ldquo;Really beautiful. If she had a figure   &mdash;   and 
were tall   &mdash;   &rdquo;  As he thought thus, he glanced at her 
figure. A figure?  Tall?  She certainly was tall   &mdash;   no, 
she wasn't   &mdash;   yes, she was. No, not tall from head to 
foot, but with the most captivating long lines   &mdash;   long 
throat, long bust, long arms, long in body and in legs 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0029" n="16"/>  
   &mdash;   long and slender   &mdash;   yet somehow not tall. He   &mdash;   all this 
took but an instant   &mdash;   returned his glance to her face. 
He was startled. The beauty had fled, leaving not a 
trace behind. Before him wavered once more a small 
insignificance. Even her skin now seemed commonplace. 
</p><p>She was saying, &ldquo;Did you wish me to do something?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   a letter. Come in,&rdquo; he said abruptly. 
</p><p>Once more the business in hand took possession of 
his mind. He became unconscious of her presence. He 
dictated slowly, carefully choosing his words, for perhaps 
a quarter of an hour. Then he stopped and paced 
up and down, revolving a new idea, a new phase of the 
business, that had flashed upon him. When he had his 
thoughts once more in form he turned toward the girl, 
the mere machine. He gazed at her in amazement. 
When he had last looked, he had seen an uninteresting 
nonentity. But that was not this person, seated before 
him in the same garments and with the same general 
blondness. That person had been a girl. This time 
the transformation was not into the sweet innocence of 
lovely childhood, but into something incredibly different. 
He was gazing now at a woman, a beautiful world-weary woman, one who had known the joys and then 
the sorrows of life and love. Heavy were the lids of 
the large eyes gazing mournfully into infinity   &mdash;   gazing 
upon the graves of a life, the long, long vista of buried 
joys. Never had he seen anything so sad or so lovely 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0030" n="17"/>  
as her mouth. The soft, smooth skin was not merely 
pale; its pallor was that of wakeful nights, of weeping 
until there were no more tears to drain away. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Hallowell   &mdash;   &rdquo; he began. 
</p><p>She startled; and like the flight of an interrupted 
dream, the woman he had been seeing vanished. There 
sat the commonplace young person he had first seen. 
He said to himself:  &ldquo;I must be a little off my base 
to-night,&rdquo; and went on with the dictation. When he 
finished she withdrew to transcribe the letter on the 
typewriter. He seated himself at his desk and plunged 
into the masses of documents. He lost the sense of his 
surroundings until she stood beside him holding the 
typewritten pages. He did not glance up, but seized 
the sheets to read and sign. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You may go,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am very much obliged 
to you.&rdquo;  And he contrived, as always, to put a 
suggestion of genuineness into the customary phrase. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm afraid it's not good work,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I'll 
wait to see if I am to do any of it over.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said he. And he looked up   &mdash;    
to find himself gazing at still another person, wholly 
different from any he had seen before. The others had 
all been women   &mdash;   womanly women, full of the weakness, 
the delicateness rather, that distinguishes the feminine. 
This woman he was looking at now had a look of 
strength. He had thought her frail. He was seeing 
a strong woman   &mdash;   a splendidly healthy body, with sinews 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0031" n="18"/>  
of steel most gracefully covered by that fair smooth 
skin of hers. And her features, too   &mdash;   why, this girl was 
a person of character, of will. 
</p><p>He glanced through the pages. &ldquo;All right   &mdash;   thank 
you,&rdquo; he said hastily. &ldquo;Please don't stay any longer. 
Leave the other thing till to-morrow.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No   &mdash;   it has to be done to-night.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I insist upon your going.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She hesitated, said quietly, &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; and turned 
to go. 
</p><p>&ldquo;And you mustn't do it at home, either.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She made no reply, but waited respectfully until it 
was evident he wished to say no more, then went out. 
He bundled together his papers, sealed and stamped 
and addressed his letter, put on his overcoat and hat 
and crossed the outer office on his way to the door. 
It was empty; she was gone. He descended in the 
elevator to the street, remembered that he had not 
locked one of his private cases, returned. As he opened 
the outer door he heard the sound of typewriter keys. 
In the corner, the obscure, sheltered corner, sat the girl, 
bent with childlike gravity over her typewriter. It 
was an amusing and a touching sight   &mdash;   she looked so 
young and so solemnly in earnest. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Didn't I tell you to go home?&rdquo; he called out, with 
mock sternness. 
</p><p>Up she sprang, her hand upon her heart. And once 
more she was beautiful, but once more it was in a way 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0032" n="19"/>  
startlingly, unbelievably different from any expression 
he had seen before. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Now, really. Miss   &mdash;   &rdquo;  He had forgotten her name. 
&ldquo;You must not stay on here. We aren't such slave 
drivers as all that. Go home, please. I'll take the 
responsibility.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She had recovered her equanimity. In her quiet, 
gentle voice   &mdash;   but it no longer sounded weak or insignificant   &mdash;    
she said, &ldquo;You are very kind, Mr. Norman. 
But I must finish my work.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Haven't I said I'd take the blame?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But you can't,&rdquo; replied she. &ldquo;I work badly. I 
seem to learn slowly. If I fall behind, I shall lose my 
place   &mdash;   sooner or later. It was that way with the last 
place I had. If you interfered, you'd only injure me. 
I've had experience. And   &mdash;   I must not lose my place.&rdquo; 
</p><p>One of the scrub women thrust her mussy head and 
ragged, shapeless body in at the door. With a start 
Norman awoke to the absurdity of his situation   &mdash;   and 
to the fact that he was placing the girl in a compromising 
position. He shrugged his shoulders, went in and 
locked the cabinet, departed. 
</p><p>&ldquo;What a queer little insignificance she is!&rdquo; thought 
he, and dismissed her from mind.</p>

<head>II</head> 
<p>MANY and fantastic are the illusions the human 
animal, in its ignorance and its optimism, devises to 
change life from a pleasant journey along a plain road 
into a fumbling and stumbling and struggling about 
in a fog. Of these hallucinations the most grotesque is 
that the weak can come together, can pass a law to curb 
the strong, can set one of their number to enforce it, 
may then disperse with no occasion further to trouble 
about the strong. Every line of every page of history 
tells how the strong   &mdash;   the nimble-witted, the farsighted, 
the ambitious   &mdash;   have worked their will upon their feebler 
and less purposeful fellow men, regardless of any and 
all precautions to the contrary. Conditions have 
improved only because the number of the strong has 
increased. With so many lions at war with each other 
not a few rabbits contrive to avoid perishing in the 
nest. 
</p><p>Norman's genius lay in ability to take away from 
an adversary the legal weapons implicitly relied upon 
and to arm his client with them. No man understood 
better than he the abysmal distinction between law and 
justice; no man knew better than he how to compel-
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0034" n="21"/>  
or to assist   &mdash;   courts to apply the law, so just in the 
general, to promoting injustice in the particular. And 
whenever he permitted conscience a voice in his internal 
debates   &mdash;   it was not often   &mdash;   he heard from it its usual 
servile approbation:  How can the reign of justice be 
more speedily brought about than by making the reign 
of law   &mdash;   lawyer law   &mdash;   intolerable? 
</p><p>About a fortnight after the trifling incident related 
in the previous chapter, Norman had to devise a secret 
agreement among several of the most eminent of his 
clients. They wished to band together, to do a thing 
expressly forbidden by the law; they wished to conspire 
to lower wages and raise prices in several railway systems 
under their control. But none would trust the 
others; so there must be something in writing, laid away 
in a secret safety deposit box along with sundry bundles 
of securities put up as forfeit, all in the custody of 
Norman. When he had worked out in his mind and in 
fragmentary notes the details of their agreement, he 
was ready for some one to do the clerical work. The 
some one must be absolutely trustworthy, as the plain 
language of the agreement would make clear to the 
dullest mind dazzling opportunities for profit   &mdash;   not only 
in stock jobbing but also in blackmail. He rang for 
Tetlow, the head clerk. Tetlow   &mdash;   smooth and sly and 
smug, lacking only courageous initiative to make him a 
great lawyer, but, lacking that, lacking all   &mdash;   Tetlow 
entered and closed the door behind him. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0035" n="22"/>  
</p><p>Norman leaned back in his desk chair and laced his 
fingers behind his head. &ldquo;One of your typewriters is 
a slight blonde girl   &mdash;   sits in the corner to the far left   &mdash;    
if she's still here.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Hallowell,&rdquo; said Tetlow. &ldquo;We are letting 
her go at the end of this week. She's nice and ladylike, 
and willing   &mdash;   in fact, most anxious to please. But the 
work's too difficult for her. She's rather   &mdash;   rather   &mdash;   well, 
not exactly stupid, but slow.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; said Norman reflectively. &ldquo;There's Miss 
Bostwick   &mdash;   perhaps she'll do.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Bostwick got married last week.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman smiled. He remembered the girl because 
she was the oldest and homeliest in the office. &ldquo;There's 
somebody for everybody   &mdash;   eh, Tetlow?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;He was a lighthouse keeper,&rdquo; said Tetlow. 
&ldquo;There's a story that he advertised for a wife. But 
that may be a joke.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why not that Miss   &mdash;   Miss Halloway?&rdquo; mused 
Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Hallowell,&rdquo; corrected Tetlow. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Hallowell   &mdash;   yes. Is she   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">very</hi> 
incompetent? 
</p><p>"Not exactly that. But business is slackening   &mdash;    
and she's been only temporary   &mdash;   and   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman cut him off with, &ldquo;Send her in.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You don't wish her dismissed?  I haven't told 
her yet.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I'm not interfering in your department. Do 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0036" n="23"/>  
as you like. . . . No   &mdash;   in this case   &mdash;   let her stay on for 
the present.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I can use her,&rdquo; said Tetlow. &ldquo;And she gets only 
ten a week.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman frowned. He did not like to <hi rend="italic">hear</hi> that an 
establishment in which he had control paid less than 
decent living wages   &mdash;   even if the market price did 
excuse   &mdash;   yes, compel it. &ldquo;Send her in,&rdquo; he repeated. 
Then, as Tetlow was about to leave, &ldquo;She is trustworthy?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;All our force is. I see to that, Mr. Norman.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Has she a young man   &mdash;   steady company, I think 
they call it?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She has no friends at all. She's extremely shy   &mdash;    
at least, reserved. Lives with her father, an old crank 
of an analytical chemist over in Jersey City. She hasn't 
even a lady friend.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Well, send her in.&rdquo; 
</p><p>A moment later Norman, looking up from his work, 
saw the dim slim nonentity before him. Again he leaned 
back and, as he talked with her, studied her face to 
make sure that his first judgment was correct. &ldquo;Do 
you stay late every night?&rdquo; asked he smilingly. 
</p><p>She colored a little, but enough to bring out the 
exquisite fineness of her white skin. &ldquo;Oh, I don't mind,&rdquo; 
said she, and there was no embarrassment in her manner. 
&ldquo;I've got to learn   &mdash;   and doing things over 
helps.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0037" n="24"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing equal to it,&rdquo; declared Norman. &ldquo;You've 
been to school?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Only six weeks,&rdquo; confessed she. &ldquo;I couldn't afford 
to stay longer.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I mean the other sort of school   &mdash;   not the typewriting.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!  Yes,&rdquo; said she. And once more he saw that 
extraordinary transformation. She became all in an 
instant delicately, deliciously lovely, with the moving, 
in a way pathetic loveliness of sweet children and sweet 
flowers. Her look was mystery; but not a mystery of 
guile. She evidently did not wish to have her past 
brought to view; but it was equally apparent that 
behind it lay hid nothing shameful, only the sad, perhaps 
the painful. Of all the periods of life youth is the best 
fitted to bear deep sorrows, for then the spirit has its 
full measure of elasticity. Yet a shadow upon youth 
is always more moving than the shadows of maturer 
years   &mdash;   those shadows that do not lie upon the surface 
but are heavy and corroding stains. When Norman 
saw this shadow upon her youth, so immature-looking, 
so helpless-looking, he felt the first impulse of genuine 
interest in her. Perhaps, had that shadow happened 
to fall when he was seeing her as the commonplace and 
colorless little struggler for bread, and seeming doomed 
speedily to be worsted in the struggle   &mdash;   perhaps, he 
would have felt no interest, but only the brief qualm 
of pity that we dare not encourage in ourselves, on a 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0038" n="25"/>  
journey so beset with hopeless pitiful things as is the 
journey through life. 
</p><p>But he had no impulse to question her. And with 
some surprise he noted that his reason for refraining 
was not the usual reason   &mdash;   unwillingness uselessly to add 
to one's own burdens by inviting the mournful 
confidences of another. No, he checked himself because in 
the manner of this frail and mouselike creature, dim 
though she once more was, there appeared a dignity, a 
reserve, that made intrusion curiously impossible. With 
an apologetic note in his voice   &mdash;   a kind and friendly 
voice   &mdash;   he said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;Please have your typewriter brought in here. I 
want you to do some work for me   &mdash;   work that isn't to be 
spoken of   &mdash;   not even to Mr. Tetlow.&rdquo;  He looked at 
her with grave penetrating eyes. &ldquo;You will not speak 
of it?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied she, and nothing more. But she 
accompanied the simple negative with a clear and honest 
sincerity of the eyes that set his mind completely 
at rest. He felt that this girl had never in her life told 
a real lie. 
</p><p>One of the office boys installed the typewriter, and 
presently Norman and the quiet nebulous girl at whom 
no one would trouble to look a second time were seated 
opposite each other with the broad table desk between, 
he leaning far back in his desk chair, fingers interlocked 
behind his proud, strong-looking head, she holding 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0039" n="26"/>  
sharpened pencil suspended over the stenographic note-book. Long before she seated herself he had forgotten 
her except as machine. There followed a troubled hour, 
as he dictated, ordered erasure, redictated, ordered re-readings, skipped back and forth, in the effort to frame 
the secret agreement in the fewest and simplest, and 
least startlingly unlawful, words. At last he leaned 
forward with the shine of triumph in his eyes. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Read straight through,&rdquo; he commanded. 
</p><p>She read, interrupted occasionally by a sharp order 
from him to correct some mistake in her notes. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Again,&rdquo; he commanded, when she translated the 
last of her notes. 
</p><p>This time she was not interrupted once. When she 
ended, he exclaimed:  &ldquo;Good!  I don't see how you did 
it so well.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Nor do I,&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You say you are only a beginner.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn't have done it so well for anyone else,&rdquo; 
said she. &ldquo;You are   &mdash;   different.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The remark was worded most flatteringly, but it did 
not sound so. He saw that she did not herself understand 
what she meant by &ldquo;different.&rdquo;  <hi rend="italic">He</hi> 
understood, 
for he knew the difference between the confused and 
confusing ordinary minds and such an intelligence as his 
own   &mdash;   simple, luminous, enlightening all minds, however 
dark, so long as they were in the light-flooded region 
around it. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0040" n="27"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Have I made the meaning clear?&rdquo; he asked. 
</p><p>He hoped she would reply that he had not, though 
this would have indicated a partial defeat in the object 
he had   &mdash;   to put the complex thing so plainly that no 
one could fail to understand. But she answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He congratulated himself that his overestimate of 
her ignorance of affairs had not lured him into giving 
her the names of the parties at interest to transcribe. 
But did she really understand?  To test her, he said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That it's wicked,&rdquo; replied she, without hesitation 
and in her small, quiet voice. 
</p><p>He laughed. In a way this girl, sitting there   &mdash;    
this inconsequential and negligible atom   &mdash;   typefied the 
masses of mankind against whom that secret agreement 
was directed. They, the feeble and powerless ones, with 
their necks ever bent under the yoke of the mighty and 
their feet ever stumbling into the traps of the crafty   &mdash;    
they, too, would utter an impotent &ldquo;Wicked!&rdquo; if they 
knew. His voice had the note of gentle raillery in it 
as he said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;No   &mdash;   not wicked. Just business.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was looking down at her book, her face 
expressionless. A few moments before he would have said 
it was an empty face. Now it seemed to him sphynxlike. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Just business,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;It is going to take 
money from those who don't know how to keep or to 
spend it and give it to those who do know how. The 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0041" n="28"/>  
money will go for building up civilization, instead of 
for beer and for bargain-trough finery to make working 
men's wives and daughters look cheap and nasty.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was silent. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Now, do you understand?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I understand what you said.&rdquo;  She looked at him 
as she spoke. He wondered how he could have fancied 
those lack-luster eyes beautiful or capable of expression. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You don't believe it?&rdquo; he asked. 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she. And suddenly in those eyes, gazing 
now into space, there came the unutterably melancholy 
look   &mdash;   heavy-lidded from heartache, weary-wise 
from long, long and bitter, experiences. Yet she still 
looked young   &mdash;   girlishly young   &mdash;   but it was the youthful 
look the classic Greek sculptors tried to give their 
young goddesses   &mdash;   the youth without beginning or end   &mdash;    
younger than a baby's, older than the oldest of the sons 
of men. He mocked himself for the fancies this queer 
creature inspired in him; but she none the less made 
him uneasy. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You don't believe it?&rdquo; he repeated. 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered again. &ldquo;My father has taught 
me   &mdash;   some things.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He drummed impatiently on the table. He resented 
her impertinence   &mdash;   for, like all men of clear and positive 
mind, he regarded contradiction as in one aspect impudent,  
in another aspect evidence of the folly of his 
contradictor. Then he gave a short laugh   &mdash;   the confessing 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0042" n="29"/>  
laugh of the clever man who has tried to believe his 
own sophistries and has failed. &ldquo;Well   &mdash;   neither do I 
believe it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Now, to get the thing typewritten.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She seated herself at the machine and set to work. 
As his mind was full of the agreement he could not 
concentrate on anything else. From time to time he 
glanced at her. Then he gave up trying to work and 
sat furtively observing her. What a quaint little 
mystery it was!  There was in it   &mdash;   that is, in her   &mdash;    
not the least charm for him. But, in all his experience 
with women, he could recall no woman with a comparable 
development of this curious quality of multiple 
personalities, showing and vanishing in swift succession. 
</p><p>There had been a time when woman had interested 
him as a puzzle to be worked out, a maze to be explored, 
a temple to be penetrated   &mdash;   until one reached the place 
where the priests manipulated the machinery for the 
wonders and miracles to fool the devotees into awe. 
Some men never get to this stage, never realize that 
their own passions, working upon the universal human 
love of the mysterious, are wholly responsible for the 
cult of woman the sphynx and the sibyl. But Norman, 
beloved of women, had been let by them into their 
ultimate secret   &mdash;   the simple humanness of woman; the 
clap-trappery of the oracles, miracles, and wonders. He 
had discovered that her &ldquo;divine intuitions&rdquo; were mere 
shrewd guesses, where they had any meaning at all; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0043" n="30"/>  
that her eloquent silences were screens for ignorance or 
boredom   &mdash;   and so on through the list of legends that 
prop the feminist cult. 
</p><p>But this girl   &mdash;   this Miss Hallowell   &mdash;   here was a 
tangible mystery   &mdash;   a mystery of physics, of chemistry. 
He sat watching her   &mdash;   watching the changes as she bent 
to her work, or relaxed, or puzzled over the meaning 
of one of her own hesitating stenographic hieroglyphics 
   &mdash;   watched her as the waning light of the afternoon 
varied its intensity upon her skin. Why, her very hair 
partook of this magical quality and altered its tint, 
its degree of vitality even, in harmony with the other 
changes. . . . What was the explanation?  By means of 
what rare mechanism did her nerve force ebb and flow 
from moment to moment, bringing about these fascinating 
surface changes in her body?  Could anything, even 
any skin, be better made than that superb skin of hers 
   &mdash;   that master work of delicacy and strength, of smoothness 
and color?  How had it been possible for him to 
fail to notice it, when he was always looking for signs 
of a good skin down town   &mdash;   and up town, too   &mdash;   in these 
days of the ravages of pastry and candy? . . . What 
long graceful fingers she had   &mdash;   yet what small hands! 
Certainly here was a peculiarity that persisted. No   &mdash;    
absurd though it seemed, no!  One way he looked at 
those hands, they were broad and strong, another way 
narrow and gracefully weak. 
</p><p>He said to himself:  &ldquo;The man who gets that girl 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0044" n="31"/>  
will have Solomon's wives rolled into one. A harem at 
the price of a wife   &mdash;   or a   &mdash;   &rdquo;  He left the thought 
unfinished. It seemed an insult to this helpless little 
creature, the more rather than the less cowardly for 
being unspoken; for, no doubt her ideas of propriety 
were firmly conventional. 
</p><p>&ldquo;About done?&rdquo; he asked impatiently. 
</p><p>She glanced up. &ldquo;In a moment. I'm sorry to be 
so slow.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You're not,&rdquo; he assured her truthfully. &ldquo;It's my 
impatience. Let me see the pages you've finished.&rdquo; 
</p><p>With them he was able to concentrate his mind. 
When she laid the last page beside his arm he was 
absorbed, did not look at her, did not think of her. 
&ldquo;Take the machine away,&rdquo; said he abruptly. 
</p><p>He was leaving for the day when he remembered her 
again. He sent for her. &ldquo;I forgot to thank you. It 
was good work. You will do well. All you need is 
practice   &mdash;   and confidence. Especially confidence.&rdquo;  He 
looked at her. She seemed frail   &mdash;   touchingly frail. 
&ldquo;You are not strong?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She smiled, and in an instant the frailty seemed 
to have been mere delicacy of build   &mdash;   the delicacy that 
goes with the strength of steel wires, or rather of the 
spider's weaving thread which sustains weights and 
shocks out of all proportion to its appearance. &ldquo;I've 
never been ill in my life,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Not a day.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Again, because she was standing before him in full 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0045" n="32"/>  
view, he noted the peculiar construction of her frame   &mdash;    
the beautiful lines of length so dextrously combined that 
her figure as a whole was not tall. He said, &ldquo;A working 
woman   &mdash;   or man   &mdash;   needs health above all. Thank 
you again.&rdquo;  And he nodded a somewhat curt dismissal. 
When she glided away and he was alone behind the 
closed door, he reflected for a moment upon the 
extraordinary amount of thinking   &mdash;   and the extraordinary 
kind of thinking   &mdash;   into which this poor little typewriter 
girl had beguiled him. He soon found the explanation 
for this vagary into a realm so foreign to a man of his 
high tastes and ambitions. &ldquo;It's because I'm so in 
love with Josephine,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;I've fallen into the 
sentimental state of all lovers. The whole sex becomes 
novel and interesting and worth while.&rdquo; 
</p><p>As he left the office, unusually late, he saw her still 
at work   &mdash;   no doubt doing over again some bungled piece 
of copying. She had her normal and natural look and 
air   &mdash;   the atomic little typewriter, unattractive and 
uninteresting. With another smile for his romantic 
imaginings, he forgot her. But when he reached the street 
he remembered her again. The threatened blizzard had 
changed into a heavy rain. The swift and sudden 
currents of air, that have made of New York a cave of the 
winds since the coming of the skyscrapers, were darting 
round corners, turning umbrellas inside out, tossing 
women's skirts about their heads, reducing all who were 
abroad to the same level of drenched and sullen wretchedness. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0046" n="33"/>  
Norman's limousine was waiting at the curb. 
He, pausing in the doorway, glanced up and down the 
street, had an impulse to return and take the girl home. 
Then he smiled satirically at himself. Her lot 
condemned her to be out in all weathers. It would not be 
a kindness but an exhibition of smug vanity to shelter 
her this one night; also, there was the question of her 
reputation   &mdash;   and the possibility of turning her head, 
perhaps just enough to cause her ruin. He sprang 
across the wind-swept, rain-swept sidewalk and into the 
limousine whose door was being held open by an obsequious 
attendant. &ldquo;Home,&rdquo; he said, and the door 
slammed. 
</p><p>Usually these journeys between office and home or 
club in the evening gave Norman a chance for ten or 
fifteen minutes of sleep. He had discovered that this 
brief dropping of the thread of consciousness gave him 
a wonderful fresh grip upon the day, enabled him to 
work or play until late into the night without fatigue. 
But that evening his mind was wide awake. Nor could 
he fix it upon business. It would interest itself only in 
the hurrying throngs of foot passengers and the ideas 
they suggested:  Here am I   &mdash;   so ran his thoughts   &mdash;   here 
am I, tucked away comfortably while all those poor 
creatures have to plod along in the storm. I could 
afford to be sick. They can't. And what have I done 
to deserve this good fortune?  Nothing. Worse than 
nothing. If I had made my career along the lines of 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0047" n="34"/>  
what is honest and right and beneficial to my fellow 
men, I'd probably be plugging home under an umbrella 
   &mdash;   and to a pretty poor excuse for a home. But I was 
too wise to do that. I've spent this day, as I spend all 
my days, in helping the powerful rich to add to their 
wealth and power, to add to the burdens those poor 
devils out there in the rain must bear. And I'm 
rewarded with a limousine, and all the rest of it. 
</p><p>These thoughts neither came from nor produced a 
mood of penitence, or of regret even. Norman was 
simply indulging in his favorite pastime   &mdash;   following 
without prejudice the leading of a chain of pure logic. 
He despised self-deceivers. He always kept himself free 
from prejudice and all its wiles. He took life as he 
found it; but he did not excuse it and himself with the 
familiar hypocrisies that make the comfortable classes 
preen themselves on being the guardians and saviours 
of the ignorant, incapable masses. When old Lockyer 
said one day that this was the function of the &ldquo;upper 
classes,&rdquo; Norman retorted:  &ldquo;Perhaps. But, if so, how 
do they perform it?  Like the brutal old-fashioned farm 
family that takes care of its insane member by keeping 
him chained in filth in the cellar.&rdquo;  And once at the 
Federal Club   &mdash;     By the way, Norman had joined it, had 
compelled it to receive him just to show his associates 
how a strong man could break even such a firmly established 
tradition as that no one who amounted to anything 
could be elected to a fashionable club in New 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0048" n="35"/>  
York. Once at the Federal Club old Galloway quoted 
with approval some essayist's remark that every clever 
human being was looking after and holding above the 
waves at least fifteen of his weaker fellows. Norman 
smiled satirically round at the complacently nodding 
circle of gray heads and white heads. &ldquo;My observation 
has been,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that every clever chap is shrewd 
enough to compel at least fifteen of his fellows to wait 
on him, to take care of him   &mdash;   do his chores   &mdash;   and his 
dirty work.&rdquo;  The nodding stopped. Scowls appeared, 
except on the face of old Galloway. He grinned. He 
was one of the few examples of a very rich man with a 
sense of humor. Norman always thought it was this 
slight incident that led to his getting the extremely 
profitable   &mdash;   and shady   &mdash;   Galloway business. 
</p><p>No, Norman's mood, as he watched the miserable 
crowds afoot and reflected upon them, was neither 
remorseful nor triumphant. He simply noted an interesting 
fact   &mdash;   a commonplace fact   &mdash;   of the methods of that 
sardonic practical joker, Life. Because the scheme of 
things was unjust and stupid, because others, most 
others, were uncomfortable or worse   &mdash;   why should he 
make himself uncomfortable?  It would be an absurdity 
to get out of his limousine and trudge along in the 
wet and the wind. It would be equally absurd to sit in 
his limousine and be unhappy about the misery of the 
world. &ldquo;I didn't create it, and I can't recreate it. 
And if I'm helping to make it worse, I'm also hastening 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0049" n="36"/>  
the time when it'll be better. The Great Ass must have 
brains and spirit kicked and cudgeled into it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>At his house in Madison Avenue, just at the crest 
of Murray Hill, there was an awning from front door 
to curb and a carpet beneath it. He passed, dry and 
comfortable, up the steps. A footman in quiet rich 
livery was waiting to receive him. From rising until 
bedtime, up town and down town, wherever he went 
and whatever he was about, every possible menial detail 
of his life was done for him. He had nothing to do 
but think about his own work and keep himself in health. 
Rarely did he have even to open or to close a door. He 
used a pen only in signing his name or marking a passage 
in a law book for some secretary to make a typewritten copy. 
</p><p>Upon most human beings this sort of luxury, carried 
beyond the ordinary and familiar uses of menial 
service, has a speedily enervating effect. Thinking 
being the most onerous of all, they have it done, also. 
They sink into silliness and moral and mental sloth. 
They pass the time at foolish purposeless games indoors 
and out; or they wander aimlessly about the earth 
chattering with similar mental decrepits, much like monkeys 
adrift in the boughs of a tropical forest. But Norman 
had the tenacity and strength to concentrate upon 
achievement all the powers emancipated by the use of 
menials wherever menials could be used. He employed 
to advantage the time saved in putting in shirt buttons 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0050" n="37"/>  
and lacing shoes and carrying books to and from 
shelves. In this lay one of the important secrets of his 
success. &ldquo;Never do for yourself what you can get some 
one else to do for you as well. Save yourself for the 
things only <hi rend="italic">you</hi> can do.&rdquo; 
</p><p>In his household there were three persons, and sixteen 
servants to wait upon them. His sister   &mdash;   she and 
her husband, Clayton Fitzhugh, were the other two 
persons   &mdash;   his sister was always complaining that there were 
not enough servants, and Frederick, the most indulgent 
of brothers, was always letting her add to the number. 
It seemed to him that the more help there was, the less 
smoothly the household ran. But that did not concern 
him; his mind was saved for more important matters. 
There was no reason why it should concern him; could 
he not compel the dollars to flood in faster than she 
could bail them out? 
</p><p>This brother and sister had come to New York 
fifteen years before, when he was twenty-two and she 
nineteen. They were from Albany, where their family 
had possessed some wealth and much social position for 
many generations. There was the usual &ldquo;queer streak&rdquo; 
in the Norman family   &mdash;   an intermittent but fixed habit 
of some one of them making a &ldquo;low marriage.&rdquo;  One 
view of this aberration might have been that there was 
in the Norman blood a tenacious instinct of sturdy and 
self-respecting independence that caused a Norman 
occasionally to do as he pleased instead of as he conventionally 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0051" n="38"/>  
ought. Each time the thing occurred there 
was a mighty and horrified hubbub throughout the 
connection. But in the broad, as the custom is, the 
Normans were complacent about the &ldquo;queer streak.&rdquo; 
They thought it kept the family from rotting out and 
running to seed. &ldquo;Nothing like an occasional infusion 
of common blood,&rdquo; Aunt Ursula Van Bruyten (born 
Norman) used to say. For her Norman's sister was 
named. 
</p><p>Norman's father had developed the &ldquo;queer streak.&rdquo; 
Their mother was the daughter of a small farmer and, 
when she met their father, was chambermaid in a Troy 
hotel, Troy then being a largish village. As soon as she 
found herself married and in a position with whose duties 
she was unfamiliar, she set about fitting herself for them 
with the same diligence and thoroughness which she had 
shown in learning chamber work in a village hotel. She 
educated herself, selected not without shrewdness and 
carefully put on an assortment of genteel airs, finally 
contrived to make a most creditable appearance   &mdash;   was more 
aristocratic in tastes and in talk than the high mightiest 
of her relatives by marriage. But her son Fred was a 
Pinkey in character. In boyhood he was noted for his 
rough and low associates. His bosom friends were the 
son of a Jewish junk dealer, the son of a colored wash-woman, and the son of an Irish day laborer. Also, the 
commonness persisted as he grew up. Instead of seeking 
aristocratic ease, he aspired to a career. He had 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0052" n="39"/>  
choice of several rich and well-born girls; but he 
developed a strong distaste for marriage of any sort and 
especially for a rich marriage. A fortune he was 
resolved to have, but it should be one that belonged to 
him. When he was about ready to enter a law office, his 
father and mother died leaving less than ten thousand 
dollars in all for his sister and himself. His sister 
hesitated, half inclined to marry a stupid second cousin 
who had thirty thousand a year. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't do it, Ursula,&rdquo; Fred advised. &ldquo;If you must 
sell out, sell for something worth while.&rdquo;  He laughed 
in his frank, ironical way. &ldquo;Fact is, we've both made 
up our minds to sell. Let's go to the best market   &mdash;    
New York. If you don't like it, you can come back and 
marry that fat-wit any time you please.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Ursula inspected herself in the glass, saw a face and 
form exceeding fair to look upon; she decided to take 
her brother's advice. At twenty she threw over a multi-millionaire and married Clayton Fitzhugh for love   &mdash;    
Clayton with only seventeen thousand a year. Of 
course, from the standpoint of fashionable ambition, 
seventeen thousand a year in New York is but one 
remove from tenement house poverty. As Clayton had 
no more ability at making money than had Ursula herself, 
there was nothing to do but live with Norman and 
&ldquo;take care of him.&rdquo;  But for this self-sacrifice of 
sisterly affection Norman would have been rich at thirty-seven. As he had to make her rich as well as himself, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0053" n="40"/>  
progress toward luxurious independence was slower   &mdash;    
and there was the house, costing nearly fifty thousand 
a year to keep up. 
</p><p>There had been a time in Norman's career   &mdash;   a brief 
and very early time   &mdash;   when, with the maternal peasant 
blood hot in his veins, he had entertained the quixotic 
idea of going into politics on the poor or people's side 
and fighting for glory only. The pressure of expensive 
living had soon driven this notion clean off. Norman 
had almost forgotten that he ever had it, was no longer 
aware how strong it had been in the last year at law 
school. Young men of high intelligence and ardent 
temperament always pass through this period. With 
some   &mdash;   a few   &mdash;   its glory lingers long after the fire has 
flickered out before the cool, steady breath of worldliness. 
</p><p>All this time Norman has been dressing for dinner. 
He now leaves the third floor and descends toward the 
library, as it still lacks twenty minutes of the dinner 
hour. 
</p><p>As he walked along the hall of the second floor a 
woman's voice called to him, &ldquo;That you, Fred?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He turned in at his sister's sitting room. She was 
standing at a table smoking a cigarette. Her tall, slim 
figure looked even taller and slimmer in the tight-fitting 
black satin evening dress. Her features faintly 
suggested her relationship to Norman. She was a handsome 
woman, with a voluptuous discontented mouth. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0054" n="41"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;What are you worried about, sis?&rdquo; inquired he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;How did you know I was worried?&rdquo; returned she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You always are.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But you're unusually worried to-night.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You never smoke just before dinner unless your 
nerves are ragged. . . . What is it?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Money.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. No one in New York worries about 
anything else.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is serious,&rdquo; 
protested she. &ldquo;I've been 
thinking   &mdash;   about your marriage   &mdash;   and what'll become of 
Clayton and me?&rdquo;  She halted, red with embarrassment. 
</p><p>Norman lit a cigarette himself. &ldquo;I ought to have 
explained,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But I assumed you'd understand.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Fred, you know Clayton can't make anything. 
And when you marry   &mdash;   why   &mdash;   what <hi rend="italic">will</hi> 
become of us!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've been taking care of Clayton's money   &mdash;   and of 
yours. I'll continue to do it. I think you'll find you're 
not so badly of. You see, my position enables me to 
compel a lot of the financiers to let me in on the ground 
floor   &mdash;   and to warn me in good time before the house 
falls. You'll not miss me, Ursula.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She showed her gratitude in her eyes, in a slight 
quiver of the lips, in an unsteadiness of tone as she said, 
&ldquo;You're the real thing, Freddie.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0055" n="42"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;You can go right on as you are now. Only   &mdash;   &rdquo; 
He was looking at her with meaning directness. 
</p><p>She moved uneasily, refused to meet his gaze. 
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said, with a suggestion of defiance. 
</p><p>&ldquo;It's all very natural to get tired of Clayton,&rdquo; said 
her brother. &ldquo;I knew you would when you married 
him. But   &mdash;     Sis, I mind my own business. Still   &mdash;    
Why make a fool of yourself?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You don't understand,&rdquo; she exclaimed passionately. 
And the light in her eyes, the color in her cheeks, restored 
to her for the moment the beauty of her youth that was 
almost gone. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Understand what?&rdquo; inquired he in a tone of gentle 
mockery. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Love. You are all ambition   &mdash;   all self control. You 
can be affectionate   &mdash;   God knows, you have been to me, 
Fred. But love you know nothing about   &mdash;   nothing.&rdquo; 
</p><p>His was the smile a man gives when in earnest and 
wishing to be thought jesting   &mdash;   or when in jest and 
wishing to be thought in earnest. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You mean Josephine?  Oh, yes, I suppose you 
do care for her in a way   &mdash;   in a nice, conventional way. 
She is a fine handsome piece   &mdash;   just the sort to fill the 
position of wife to a man like you. She's sweet and 
charming, she appreciates, she flatters you. I'm sure 
she loves you as much as a <hi rend="italic">girl</hi> knows 
how to love. But 
it's all so conventional, so proper. Your position   &mdash;   her 
money. You two are of the regulation type even in 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0056" n="43"/>  
that you're suited to each other in height and 
figure. Everybody'll say, `What a fine couple   &mdash;   so well 
matched!' &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe <hi rend="italic">you</hi> don't understand,&rdquo; 
said Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;If Josephine were poor and low-born   &mdash;   weren't one 
of us   &mdash;   and all that   &mdash;   would you have her?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm sure I don't know,&rdquo; was his prompt and amused 
answer. &ldquo;I can only say that I know what I want, she 
being what she is.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Ursula shook her head. &ldquo;I have only to see you 
and her together to know that you at least don't 
understand love.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It might be well if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> 
didn't,&rdquo; said Norman dryly. 
&ldquo;You might be less unhappy   &mdash;   and Clayton less uneasy.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, but I can't help myself. Don't you see it in 
me, Fred?  I'm not a fool. Yet see what a fool I act.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Spoiled child   &mdash;   that's all. No self-control.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You despise everyone who isn't as strong as you.&rdquo; 
She looked at him intently. &ldquo;I wonder if you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> as 
self-controlled as you imagine. Sometimes I wish you'd 
get a lesson. Then you'd be more sympathetic. But 
it isn't likely you will   &mdash;   not through a woman. Oh, 
they're such pitifully easy game for a man like you. 
But then men are the same way with you   &mdash;   quite as 
easy. You get anything you want. . . . You're really 
going to stick to Josephine?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He nodded. &ldquo;It's time for me to settle down.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0057" n="44"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   I think it is,&rdquo; she went on thoughtfully. &ldquo;I 
can hardly believe you're to marry. Of course, she's 
the grand prize. Still   &mdash;   I never imagined you'd come 
in and surrender. I guess you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> care 
for her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why else should I marry?&rdquo; argued he. &ldquo;She's 
got nothing I need   &mdash;   except herself, Ursula.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> it you see in her?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What you see   &mdash;   what everyone sees,&rdquo; replied Fred, 
with quiet, convincing enthusiasm. &ldquo;What no one could 
help seeing. As you say, she's the grand prize.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, she is sweet and handsome   &mdash;   and intelligent 
   &mdash;   very superior, without making others feel that they're 
outclassed. Still   &mdash;   there's something lacking   &mdash;   not in her 
perhaps, but in you. You have it for her   &mdash;   she's crazy 
about you. But she hasn't it for you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I can't tell you. It isn't a thing that can be put 
into words.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then it doesn't exist.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes it does,&rdquo; cried Ursula. &ldquo;If the engagement 
were to be broken   &mdash;   or if anything were to happen 
to her   &mdash;   why, you'd get over it   &mdash;   would go on as if nothing 
had happened. If she didn't fit in with your plans 
and ambitions, she'd be sacrificed so quick she'd not 
know what had taken off her head. But if you felt what 
I mean   &mdash;   then you'd give up everything   &mdash;   do the wildest, 
craziest things.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; scoffed Norman. &ldquo;I can imagine 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0058" n="45"/>  
myself making a fool of myself about a woman 
as easily as about anything else. But I can't imagine 
myself playing the fool for anything whatsoever.&rdquo; 
</p><p>There was mysterious fire in Ursula's absent eyes. 
&ldquo;You remember me as a girl   &mdash;   how mercenary I was   &mdash;    
how near I came to marrying Cousin Jake?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> saved you from that.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   and for what?  I fell in love.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And out again.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I was deceived in Clayton   &mdash;   deceived myself   &mdash;    
naturally. How is a woman to know, without experience?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I'm not criticising,&rdquo; said the brother. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Besides, a love marriage that fails is different from 
a mercenary marriage that fails.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Very   &mdash;   very,&rdquo; agreed he. &ldquo;Just the difference 
between an honorable and a dishonorable bankruptcy.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Anyhow   &mdash;   it's bankrupt   &mdash;   my marriage. But I've 
learned what love is   &mdash;   that there is such a thing   &mdash;   and 
that it's valuable. Yes, Fred, I've got the taste for 
that wine   &mdash;   the habit of it. Could I go back to water 
or milk?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Spoiled baby   &mdash;   that's the whole story. If you had 
a nursery full of children   &mdash;   or did the heavy house-work   &mdash;   you'd never think of these foolish moonshiny 
things.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yet you say you love!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Clayton is as good as any you're likely to run 
across   &mdash;   is better than <hi rend="italic">some</hi> I've seen 
about.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0059" n="46"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;How can <hi rend="italic">you</hi> say?&rdquo; cried she.  
&ldquo;It's for me 
to judge.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;If you would only <hi rend="italic">judge!</hi>&rdquo; 
</p><p>Ursula sighed. &ldquo;It's useless to talk to you. Let's 
go down.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman, following her from the room, stopped her 
in the doorway to give her a brotherly hug and kiss. 
&ldquo;You won't make an out-and-out idiot of yourself, 
will you, Ursula?&rdquo; he said, in his winning manner. 
</p><p>The expression of her eyes as she looked at him 
showed how strong was his influence over her. &ldquo;You 
know I'll come to you for advice before I do anything 
final,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Oh, I don't know what I want!  I 
only know what I don't want. I wish I were well 
balanced   &mdash;   as you are, Fred.&rdquo;</p>

<head>III</head> 
<p>THE brother and sister dined alone. Clayton was 
finding his club a more comfortable place than his home, 
in those days of his wife's disillusionment and hesitation 
about the future. Many weak creatures are curiously 
armed for the unequal conflict of existence   &mdash;    
some with fleetness of foot, some with a pole-cat weapon 
of malignance, some with porcupine quills, some with 
a 'possumlike instinct for &ldquo;playing dead.&rdquo;  Of these 
last was Fitzhugh. He knew when to be silent, when 
to keep out of the way, when to &ldquo;sit tight&rdquo; and wait. 
His wife had discovered that he was a fool   &mdash;   that he 
perhaps owed more to his tailor than to any other 
single factor for the success of his splendid pose of 
the thorough gentleman. Yet she did not realize what 
an utter fool he was, so clever had he been in the use 
of the art of discreet silence. Norman suspected him, 
but could not believe a human being capable of such 
fathomless vacuity as he found whenever he tried to 
explore his brother-in-law's brain. 
</p><p>After dinner Norman took Ursula to the opera, 
to join the Seldins, and after the first act went to 
Josephine, who had come with only a deaf old aunt. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0063" n="48"/>  
Josephine loved music, and to hear an opera from a 
box one must be alone. Norman entered as the lights 
went up. It always gave him a feeling of dilation, 
this spectacle of material splendor   &mdash;   the women, whose 
part it is throughout civilization to-day to wear for 
public admiration and envy the evidences of the prowess 
of the males to whom they belong. A truer version of 
Dr. Holmes's aphorism would be that it takes several 
generations in oil to make a deep-dyed snob   &mdash;   wholly to 
destroy a man's or a woman's point of view, sense of 
the kinship of all flesh, and to make him or her over 
into the genuine believer in caste and worshiper of it. 
For all his keenness of mind, of humor, Norman had the 
fast-dyed snobbishness of his family and friends. He 
knew that caste was silly, that such displays as this 
vulgar flaunting of jewels and costly dresses were in 
atrocious bad taste. But it is one thing to know, 
another thing to feel; and his feeling was delight in the 
spectacle, pride in his own high rank in the aristocracy. 
</p><p>His eyes rested with radiant pleasure on the girl 
he was to marry. And she was indeed a person to 
appeal to the passion of pride. Simply and most 
expensively dressed in pearl satin, with only a little 
jewelry, she sat in the front of her parterre box, a 
queen by right of her father's wealth, her family's 
position, her own beauty. She was a large woman   &mdash;   tall, a 
big frame but not ungainly. She had brilliant dark 
eyes, a small proud head set upon shoulders that were 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0064" n="49"/>  
slenderly young now and, even when they should 
became matronly, would still be beautiful. She had good 
teeth, an exquisite smile, the gentle good humor of those 
who, comfortable themselves, would not have the slightest 
objection to all others being equally so. Because 
she laughed appreciatively and repeated amusingly she 
had great reputation for wit. Because she industriously 
picked up from men a plausible smatter of small talk 
about politics, religion, art and the like, she was 
renowned as clever verging on profound. And she 
believed herself both witty and wise   &mdash;   as do thousands, 
male and female, with far less excuse. 
</p><p>She had selected Norman for the same reason that 
he had selected her; each recognized the other as the 
&ldquo;grand prize.&rdquo;  Pity is not nearly so close kin to love 
as is the feeling that the other person satisfies to the 
uttermost all one's pet vanities. It would have been 
next door to impossible for two people so well matched 
not to find themselves drawn to each other and filled 
with sympathy and the sense of comradeship, so far as 
there can be comradeship where two are driving luxuriously 
along the way of life, with not a serious cause for 
worry. People without half the general fitness of these 
two for each other have gone through to the end, 
regarding themselves and regarded as the most devoted 
of lovers. Indeed, they were lovers. Only one of those 
savage tests, to which in all probability they would never 
be exposed, would or could reveal just how much, or 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0065" n="50"/>  
how little, that vague, variable word lovers meant when 
applied to them. 
</p><p>As their eyes met, into each pair leaped the fine, 
exalted light of pride in possession. &ldquo;This wonderful 
woman is mine!&rdquo; his eyes said. And her eyes answered, 
&ldquo;And you   &mdash;   you most wonderful of men   &mdash;   you are 
mine!&rdquo;  It always gave each of them a thrill like 
intoxication to meet, after a day's separation. All the joy of 
their dazzling good fortune burst upon them afresh. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'll venture you haven't thought of me the whole 
day,&rdquo; said she as he dropped to the chair behind her. 
</p><p>It was a remark she often made   &mdash;   to give him the 
opportunity to say, &ldquo;I've thought of little else, I'm 
sorry to say   &mdash;   I, who have a career to look after.&rdquo;  He 
made the usual answer, and they smiled happily at each 
other. &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I?  What else has a woman to think about?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her statement was as true as his was false. He 
was indeed all she had to think about   &mdash;   all worth wasting 
the effort of thought upon. But he   &mdash;   though he did 
not realize it   &mdash;   had thought of her only in the incidental 
way in which an ambition-possessed man must force 
himself to think of a woman. The best of his mind was 
commandeered to his career. An amiable but shakily 
founded theory that it was &ldquo;our&rdquo; career enabled him 
to say without sense of lying that his chief thought 
had been she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;How those men down town would poke fun at 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0066" n="51"/>  
you,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if they knew you had me with you all 
the time, right beside you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>This amused him. &ldquo;Still, I suspect there are lots 
of men who'd be exposed in the same way if there were 
a general and complete show-down.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes I wish I really were with you   &mdash;   working 
with you   &mdash;   helping you. You have girls   &mdash;   a girl   &mdash;   to 
be your secretary   &mdash;   or whatever you call it   &mdash;   don't 
you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You should have seen the one I had to-day. But 
there's always something pathetic about every girl who 
has to make her own living.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Pathetic!&rdquo; protested Miss Burroughs. &ldquo;Not at 
all. I think it's fine.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn't say that if you had tried it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Indeed, I should,&rdquo; she declared with spirit. &ldquo;You 
men are entirely too soft about women. You don't 
realize how strong they are. And, of course, women 
don't resist the temptation to use their sex when they see 
how easy it is to fool men that way. The sad thing 
about it is that the woman who gets along by using 
her sex and by appealing to the soft-heartedness of 
men never learns to rely on herself. She's likely to 
come to grief sooner or later.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;There's truth in all that,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;Enough 
to make it dangerously unjust. There's so much lying 
done about getting on that it's no wonder those who've 
never tried to do for themselves get a wholly false notion 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0067" n="52"/>  
of the situation. It is hard   &mdash;   bitterly hard   &mdash;   for a man 
to get on. Most men don't. Most men?  All but a 
mere handful. And if those who do get on were to tell 
the truth   &mdash;   the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> truth   &mdash;   about how 
they succeeded 
   &mdash;   well, it'd not make a pleasant story.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But <hi rend="italic">you've</hi> got on,&rdquo; retorted 
the girl. 
</p><p>&ldquo;So I have. And how?&rdquo;  Norman smiled with 
humorous cynicism. &ldquo;I'll never tell   &mdash;   not all   &mdash;   only the 
parts that sound well. And those parts are the least 
important. However, let's not talk about that. What 
I set out to say was that, while it's hard for a man to 
make a decent living   &mdash;   unless he has luck   &mdash;   and harder 
still   &mdash;   much harder   &mdash;   for him to rise to independence   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn't so dreadfully hard for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>,&rdquo; interrupted 
Josephine, looking at him with proud admiration. &ldquo;But 
then, you had a wonderful brain.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That wasn't what did it,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;And, in 
spite of all my advantages   &mdash;   friendships, education, 
enough money to tide me over the beginnings   &mdash;   in spite 
of all that, I had a frightful time. Not the work. Of 
course, I had to work, but I like that. No, it was the   &mdash;    
the maneuvering, let's call it   &mdash;   the hardening process.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; she exclaimed. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone who succeeds   &mdash;   in active life. You don't 
understand the system, dear. It's a cutthroat game. 
It isn't at all what the successful hypocrites describe 
in their talks to young men!&rdquo;  He laughed. &ldquo;If I 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0068" n="53"/>  
had followed the `guides to success,' I'd not be here. 
Oh, yes, I've made terrible sacrifices, but   &mdash;   &rdquo; his look 
at her made her thrill with exaltation   &mdash;   &ldquo;it was worth 
doing. . . . I understand and sympathize with those who 
scorn to succeed. But I'm glad I happened not to be 
born with their temperament, at least not with enough 
of it to keep me down.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You're too hard on yourself, too generous to the 
failures.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I don't mean the men who were too lazy to 
do the work or too cowardly to dare the   &mdash;   the unpleasant 
things. And I'm not hard with myself   &mdash;   only frank. 
But we were talking of the women. Poor things, what 
chance have they got?  You scorn them for using their 
sex. Wait till you're drowning, dear, before you criticise 
another for what he does to save himself when he's 
sinking for the last time. I used everything I had in 
making my fight. If I could have got on better or 
quicker by the aid of my sex, I'd have used that.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't say those things, Fred,&rdquo; cried Josephine, 
smiling but half in earnest. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?  Aren't you glad I'm here?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She gave him a long look of passionate love and 
lowered her eyes. 
</p><p>&ldquo;At whatever cost?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said in a low voice. &ldquo;But I'm <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> you 
exaggerate.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've done nothing <hi rend="italic">you</hi> 
wouldn't approve of   &mdash;   or 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0069" n="54"/>  
find excuses for. But that's because you   &mdash;   I   &mdash;   all of us 
in this class   &mdash;   and in most other classes   &mdash;   have been 
trained to false ideas   &mdash;   no, to perverted ideas   &mdash;   to a 
system of morality that's twisted to suit the demands 
of practical life. On Sundays we go to a magnificent 
church to hear an expensive preacher and choir, go in 
expensive dress and in carriages, and we never laugh at 
ourselves. Yet we are going in the name of One who 
was born in a stable and who said that we must give 
everything to the poor, and so on.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I don't see what we could do about it   &mdash;   &rdquo; she 
said hesitatingly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;We couldn't do anything. Only   &mdash;   don't you see 
my point?   &mdash;   the difference between theory and practice? 
Personally, I've no objection   &mdash;   no strong objection   &mdash;   to 
the practice. All I object to is the lying and faking 
about it, to make it seem to fit the theory. But we were 
talking of women   &mdash;   women who work.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've no doubt you're right,&rdquo; admitted she. &ldquo;I 
suppose they aren't to blame for using their sex. I 
ought to be ashamed of myself, to sneer at them.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, their sex does few of them 
any good. The reverse. You see, an attractive woman 
   &mdash;   one who's attractive <hi rend="italic">as</hi> a woman   &mdash;   can 
skirmish round 
and find some one to support her. But most of the 
working women   &mdash;   those who keep on at it   &mdash;   don't find 
the man. They're not attractive, not even at the start. 
After they've been at it a few years and lose the little 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0070" n="55"/>  
bloom they ever had   &mdash;   why, they've got to take their 
chances at the game, precisely like a man. Only, they're 
handicapped by always hoping that they'll be able to 
quit and become married women. I'd like to see how 
men would behave if they could find or could imagine 
any alternative to `root hog or die.' &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What's the matter with you this evening, Fred? 
I never saw you in such a bitter mood.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;We never happened to get on this subject before.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we have. And you always have scoffed 
at the men who fail.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And I still scoff at them   &mdash;   most of them. A lot of 
lazy cowards. Or else, so bent on self-indulgence   &mdash;    
petty self-indulgence   &mdash;   that they refuse to make the 
small sacrifice to-day for the sake of the large advantage 
day after to-morrow. Or else so stuffed with vanity 
that they never see their own mistakes. However, why 
blame them?  They were born that way, and can't 
change. A man who has the equipment of success and 
succeeds has no more right to sneer at one less lucky 
than you would have to laugh at a poor girl because 
she wasn't dressed as well as you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What a mood!  <hi rend="italic">Something</hi> must 
have happened.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said he reflectively. &ldquo;Possibly that 
girl set me off.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What girl?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;The one I told you about. The unfortunate little 
creature who was typewriting for me this afternoon. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0071" n="56"/>  
Not so very little, either. A curious figure she had. 
She was tall yet she wasn't. She seemed thin, and when 
you looked again, you saw that she was really only 
slender, and beautifully shaped throughout.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Miss Burroughs laughed. &ldquo;She must have been attractive.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not in the least. Absolutely without charm   &mdash;   and 
so homely   &mdash;   no, not homely   &mdash;   commonplace. No, that's 
not right, either. She had a startling way of fading and 
blazing out. One moment she seemed a blank   &mdash;   pale, 
lifeless, colorless, a nobody. The next minute she 
became   &mdash;   amazingly different. Not the same thing every 
time, but different things.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Frederick Norman was too experienced a dealer 
with women deliberately to make the mistake   &mdash;   rather, 
to commit the breach of tact and courtesy   &mdash;   involved 
in praising one woman to another. But in this case 
it never occurred to him that he was talking to a woman 
of a woman. Josephine Burroughs was a lady; the 
other was a piece of office machinery   &mdash;   and a very trivial 
piece at that. But he saw and instantly understood 
the look in her eyes   &mdash;   the strained effort to keep the 
telltale upper lip from giving its prompt and irrepressible 
signal of inward agitation. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm very much interested,&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, she was a curiosity,&rdquo; said he carelessly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Has she been there   &mdash;   long?&rdquo; inquired Josephine, 
with a feigned indifference that did not deceive him. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0072" n="57"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Several months, I believe. I never noticed her 
until a few days ago. And until to-day I had forgotten 
her. She's one of the kind it's difficult to remember.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He fell to glancing round the house, pretending to 
be unconscious of the furtive suspicion with which she 
was observing him. She said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;She's your secretary now?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Merely a general office typewriter.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The curtain went up for the second act. Josephine 
fixed her attention on the stage   &mdash;   apparently undivided 
attention. But Norman felt rather than saw that she 
was still worrying about the &ldquo;curiosity.&rdquo;  He marveled 
at this outcropping of jealousy. It seemed ridiculous 
   &mdash;   it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> ridiculous. He laughed to 
himself. If she 
could see the girl   &mdash;   the obscure, uninteresting cause of 
her agitation   &mdash;   how she would mock at herself!  Then, 
too, there was the absurdity of thinking him capable of 
such a stoop. A woman of their own class   &mdash;   or a woman 
of its corresponding class, on the other side of the line 
   &mdash;   yes. No doubt she had heard things that made her 
uneasy, or, at least, ready to be uneasy. But this 
poorly dressed obscurity, with not a charm that could 
attract even a man of her own lowly class   &mdash;     It was such 
a good joke that he would have teased Josephine about 
it but for his knowledge of the world   &mdash;   a knowledge in 
whose primer it was taught that teasing is both bad 
taste and bad judgment. Also, it was beneath his dignity, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0073" n="58"/>  
it was offense to his vanity, to couple his name 
with the name of one so beneath him that even the matter 
of sex did not make the coupling less intolerable. 
</p><p>When the curtain fell several people came into the 
box, and he went to make a few calls round the parterre. 
He returned after the second act. They were again 
alone   &mdash;   the deaf old aunt did not count. At once 
Josephine began upon the same subject. With studied 
indifference   &mdash;   how amusing for a woman of her 
inexperience to try to fool a man of his experience!   &mdash;   she 
said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me some more about that typewriter girl. 
Women who work always interest me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She wouldn't,&rdquo; said Norman. The subject had 
been driven clean out of his mind, and he didn't wish to 
return to it. &ldquo;Some day they will venture to make 
judicious long cuts in Wagner's operas, and then they'll 
be interesting. It always amuses me, this reverence of 
little people for the great ones   &mdash;   as if a great man were 
always great. No   &mdash;   he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> always great.  
But often it's 
in a dull way. And the dull parts ought to be skipped.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't like the opera this evening,&rdquo; said she. 
&ldquo;What you said a while ago has set me to thinking. 
Is that girl a lady?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She works,&rdquo; laughed he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;But she might have been a lady.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm sure I don't know.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't you know <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> about 
her?&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0074" n="59"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Except that she's trustworthy   &mdash;   and insignificant 
and not too good at her business.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I shouldn't think you could afford to keep 
incompetent people,&rdquo; said the girl shrewdly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps they won't keep her,&rdquo; parried Norman 
gracefully. &ldquo;The head clerk looks after those things.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;He probably likes her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Norman, too indifferent to be cautious. 
&ldquo;She has no `gentlemen friends.' &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; said the girl, and she 
could not keep a certain sharpness out of her voice. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Tetlow, the head clerk, told me. I asked him a 
few questions about her. I had some confidential work 
to do and didn't want to trust her without being sure.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He saw that she was now prey to her jealous suspicion. 
He was uncertain whether to be amused or irritated. 
She had to pause long and with visible effort 
collect herself before venturing: 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, she does confidential work for you?  I thought 
you said she was incompetent.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He, the expert cross-examiner, had to admire her 
skill at that high science and art. &ldquo;I felt sorry for 
her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She seemed such a forlorn little 
creature.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She laughed with a constrained attempt at raillery. 
&ldquo;I never should have suspected you of such weakness. 
To give confidential things to a forlorn little incompetent, 
out of pity.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0075" n="60"/>  
</p><p>He was irritated, distinctly. The whole thing was 
preposterous. It reminded him of feats of his own 
before a jury. By clever questioning, Josephine had 
made about as trifling an incident as could be imagined 
take on really quite imposing proportions. There was 
annoyance in his smile as he said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;Shall I send her up to see you?  You might find 
it amusing, and maybe you could do something for her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Josephine debated. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she finally said. &ldquo;I 
wish you would send her   &mdash;   &rdquo; with a little sarcasm   &mdash;    
&ldquo;if you can spare her for an hour or so.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't make it longer than that,&rdquo; laughed he. 
&ldquo;Everything will stop while she's gone.&rdquo; 
</p><p>It pleased him, in a way, this discovery that Josephine 
had such a common, commonplace weakness as jealousy. 
But it also took away something from his high 
esteem for her   &mdash;   an esteem born of the lover's idealizings; 
for, while he was not of the kind of men who are 
on their knees before women, he did have a deep respect 
for Josephine, incarnation of all the material things 
that dazzled him   &mdash;   a respect with something of the reverential 
in it, and something of awe   &mdash;   more than he would 
have admitted to himself. To-day, as of old, the image-makers are as sincere worshipers as visit the shrines. 
In our prostrations and genuflections in the temple we 
do not discriminate against the idols we ourselves have 
manufactured; on the contrary, them we worship with 
peculiar gusto. Norman knew his gods were frauds, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0076" n="61"/>  
that their divine qualities were of the earth earthy. But 
he served them, and what most appealed to him in 
Josephine was that she incorporated about all their 
divine qualities. 
</p><p>He and his sister went home together. Her first 
remark in the auto was:  &ldquo;What were you and Josie 
quarreling about?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Quarreling?&rdquo; inquired he in honest surprise. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I looked at her through my glasses and saw that 
the was all upset   &mdash;   and you, too.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;This is too ridiculous,&rdquo; cried he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;She looked   &mdash;   jealous.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Nonsense!  What an imagination you have!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I saw what I saw,&rdquo; Ursula maintained. &ldquo;Well, 
I suppose she has heard something   &mdash;   something recent. 
I thought you had sworn off, Fred. But I might have 
known.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman was angry. He wondered at his own 
exasperation, out of all proportion to any apparent 
provoking cause. And it was most unusual for him to feel 
temper, all but unprecedented for him to show it, no 
matter how strong the temptation. 
</p><p>&ldquo;It's a good idea, to make her jealous,&rdquo; pursued 
his sister. &ldquo;Nothing like jealousy to stimulate interest.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Josephine is not that sort of woman.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You know better. All women are that sort. All 
men, too. Of course, some men and women grow angry 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0077" n="62"/>  
and go away when they get jealous while others stick 
closer. So one has to be judicious.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Josephine and I understand each other far too 
well for such pettiness.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Try her. No, you needn't. You have.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Didn't I tell you   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then what was she questioning you about?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Just to show you how wrong you were, I'll tell 
you. She was asking me about a poor little girl down 
at the office   &mdash;   one she wants to help.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Ursula laughed. &ldquo;To help out of your office, I 
guess. I thought you'd lived long enough, Fred, to 
learn that no woman trusts <hi rend="italic">any</hi> man 
about <hi rend="italic">any</hi> woman. 
Who is this `poor little girl'?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't even know her name. One of the typewriters.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What made Josephine jealous of her?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Haven't I told you Josephine was not   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I saw. Who is this girl?   &mdash;   pretty?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman pretended to stifle a yawn. &ldquo;Josephine 
bored me half to death talking about her. Now it's 
you. I never heard so much about so little.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Is there something up between you and the girl?&rdquo; 
teased Ursula. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Now, that's an outrage!&rdquo; cried Norman. &ldquo;She's 
got nothing but her reputation, poor child. Do leave 
her that.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Is she very young?&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0078" n="63"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Youth is a charm in itself.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What sort of rot is this!&rdquo; exclaimed he. &ldquo;Do 
you think I'd drop down to anything of that kind   &mdash;   in 
<hi rend="italic">any</hi> circumstances?  A little working 
girl   &mdash;   and in my 
own office?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you heat so, Fred?&rdquo; teased the sister. 
&ldquo;Really, I don't wonder Josephine was torn up.&rdquo; 
</p><p>An auto almost ran into them   &mdash;   one of those 
innumerable hairbreadth escapes that make the streets 
of New York as exciting as a battle   &mdash;   and as dangerous. 
For a few minutes Ursula's mind was deflected. But a 
fatality seemed to pursue the subject of the pale 
obscurity whose very name he was uncertain whether he 
remembered aright. 
</p><p>Said Ursula, as they entered the house, &ldquo;A girl 
working in the office with a man has a magnificent chance 
at him. It's lucky for the men that women don't know 
their business, but are amateurs and too stuck on 
themselves to set and bait their traps properly. Is that 
girl trying to get round you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What possesses everybody to-night!&rdquo; cried Norman. 
&ldquo;I tell you the girl 's as uninteresting a specimen 
as you could find.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then why are <hi rend="italic">you</hi> so 
interested in her?&rdquo; teased 
the sister. 
</p><p>Norman shrugged his shoulders, laughed with his 
normal easy good humor and went to his own floor. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0079" n="64"/>  
</p><p>On top of the pile of letters beside his plate, next 
morning, lay a note from Josephine: 
 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't forget your promise about that girl, dear. 
I've an hour before lunch, and could see her then. I 
was out of humor last night. I'm very penitent this 
morning. Please forgive me. Maybe I can do something 
for her.</p> 
            <p>                       &ldquo;JOSEPHINE.&rdquo;</p> 
 
<p>Norman read with amused eyes. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; soliloquized 
he, &ldquo;I'm not likely to forget that poor little 
creature again. What a fuss about nothing!&rdquo;</p> 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0080" n="65"/>

<div1 type="chapter" n="4" id="d10"> 
<head>IV</head> 
<p>MANY men, possibly a majority, have sufficient 
equipment for at least a fair measure of success. Yet 
all but a few are downright failures, passing their lives 
in helpless dependence, glad to sell themselves for a 
small part of the value they create. For this there are 
two main reasons. The first is, as Norman said, that 
only a few men have the self-restraint to resist the 
temptings of a small pleasure to-day in order to gain 
a larger to-morrow or next day. The second is that 
few men possess the power of continuous concentration. 
Most of us cannot concentrate at all; any slight 
distraction suffices to disrupt and destroy the whole train 
of thought. A good many can concentrate for a few 
hours, for a week or so, for two or three months. But 
there comes a small achievement and it satisfies, or a 
small discouragement and it disheartens. Only to the 
rare few is given the power to concentrate steadily, 
year in and year out, through good and evil event or 
report. 
</p><p>As Norman stepped into his auto to go to the office 
   &mdash;   he had ridden a horse in the park before breakfast 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0081" n="66"/>  
until its hide was streaked with lather   &mdash;   the instant he 
entered his auto, he discharged his mind of everything 
but the business before him down town   &mdash;   or, rather, 
business filled his mind so completely that everything else 
poured out and away. A really fine mind   &mdash;   a perfect 
or approximately perfect instrument to the purposes of 
its possessor   &mdash;   is a marvelous spectacle of order. It is 
like a vast public library constantly used by large 
numbers. There are alcoves, rows on rows, shelves on 
shelves, with the exactest system everywhere prevailing, 
with the attendants moving about in list-bottomed shoes, 
fulfilling without the least hesitation or mistake the 
multitude of directions from the central desk. It is 
like an admirably drilled army, where there is the nice 
balance of freedom and discipline that gives mobility 
without confusion; the divisions, down to files and even 
units, can be disposed along the line of battle wherever 
needed, or can be marshaled in reserve for use at the 
proper moment. Such a mind may be used for good 
purpose or bad   &mdash;   or for mixed purposes, after the usual 
fashion in human action. But whatever the service to 
which it is put, it acts with equal energy and precision. 
Character   &mdash;   that is a thing apart. The character determines 
the morality of action; but only the intellect 
determines the skill of action. 
</p><p>In the offices of that great law firm one of the 
keenest pleasures of the more intelligent of the staff was 
watching the workings of Frederick Norman's mind   &mdash;    
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0082" n="67"/>  
its ease of movement, its quickness and accuracy, its 
obedience to the code of mental habits he had fixed for 
himself. In large part all this was born with the man; 
but it had been brought to a state of perfection by the 
most painful labor, by the severest discipline, by years 
of practice of the sacrifice of small temptations   &mdash;    
temptations to waste time and strength on the little pleasant 
things which result in such heavy bills   &mdash;   bills that 
bankrupt a man in middle life and send him in old age into 
the deserts of poverty and contempt. 
</p><p>Such an unique and trivial request as that of 
Josephine Burroughs being wholly out of his mental 
habit for down town, he forgot it along with everything 
else having to do with uptown only   &mdash;   along with 
Josephine herself, to tell a truth which may pique the 
woman reader and may be wholly misunderstood by 
the sentimentalists. By merest accident he was reminded. 
</p><p>As the door of his private office opened to admit 
an important client he happened to glance up. And 
between the edge of the door frame and his client's 
automobile-fattened and carefully dressed body, he 
caught a glimpse of the &ldquo;poor little forlornness&rdquo; who 
chanced to be crossing the outer office. A glint of 
sunlight on her hair changed it from lifelessness to golden 
vital vividness; the same chance sunbeam touched her 
pale skin with a soft yellow radiation   &mdash;   and her profile 
was delicately fine and regular. Thus Norman, who observed 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0083" n="68"/>  
everything, saw a head of finely wrought gold   &mdash;    
a startling cameo against the dead white of office wall. 
It was only with the second thought that he recognized 
her. The episode of the night before came back and 
Josephine's penitent yet persistent note. 
</p><p>He glanced at the clock. Said the client in the 
amusing tone of one who would like to take offense if 
he only dared, &ldquo;I'll not detain you long, Mr. Norman. 
And really the matter is extremely important.&rdquo; 
</p><p>There are not many lawyers, even of the first rank, 
with whom their big clients reverse the attitude of servant 
and master. Norman might well have been flattered. 
In that restrained tone from one used to servility and 
fond of it and easily miffed by lack of it was the whole 
story of Norman's long battle and splendid victory. 
But he was not in the mood to be flattered; he was 
thinking of other things. And it presently annoyed him 
that his usually docile mind refused to obey his will's 
order to concentrate on the client and the business   &mdash;    
said business being one of those huge schemes through 
which a big monster of a corporation is constructed by 
lawyers out of materials supplied by great capitalists 
and controllers of capital, is set to eating in enormous 
meals the substance of the people; at some obscure point 
in all the principal veins small but leechlike parasite 
corporations are attached, industriously to suck away 
the surplus blood so that the owners of the beast may 
say, &ldquo;It is eating almost nothing. See how lean it is, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0084" n="69"/>  
poor thing!  Why, the bones fairly poke through its 
meager hide.&rdquo; 
</p><p>An interesting and highly complicated enterprise is 
such a construction. It was of the kind in which 
Norman's mind especially delighted; Hercules is himself only 
in presence of an herculean labor. But on that day he 
could not concentrate, and because of a trifle!  He felt 
like a giant disabled by a grain of dust in the eye   &mdash;    
yes, a mere grain of dust!''  I must love Josephine 
even more than I realize, to be fretted by such a paltry 
thing,'' thought he. And after patiently enduring the 
client for half an hour without being able to grasp the 
outlines of the project, he rose abruptly and said:  &ldquo;I 
must get into my mind the points you've given me 
before we can go further. So I'll not waste your 
time.&rdquo; 
</p><p>This sounded very like &ldquo;Clear out   &mdash;   you've bored 
me to my limit of endurance.&rdquo;  But the motions of a 
mind such as he knew Norman had were beyond and 
high above the client's mere cunning at dollar-trapping. 
He felt that it was the part of wisdom   &mdash;   also soothing 
to vanity   &mdash;   to assume that Norman meant only what 
his words conveyed. When Norman was alone he rang 
for an office boy and said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;Please ask Miss Halliday to come here.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The boy hesitated. &ldquo;Miss Hallowell?&rdquo; he suggested. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Hallowell   &mdash;   thanks   &mdash;   Hallowell,&rdquo; said Norman. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0085" n="70"/>  
</p><p>And it somehow pleased him that he had not 
remembered her name. How significant it was of her 
insignificance that so accurate a memory as his should 
make the slip. When she, impassive, colorless, nebulous, 
stood before him the feeling of pleasure was, queerly 
enough, mingled with a sense of humiliation. What 
absurd vagaries his imagination had indulged in!  For 
it must have been sheer hallucination, his seeing those 
wonders in her. How he would be laughed at if those 
pictures he had made of her could be seen by any other 
eyes!''  They must be right when they say a man in 
love is touched in the head. Only, why the devil should 
I have happened to get these crazy notions about a 
person I've no interest in?''  However, the main point 
   &mdash;   and most satisfactory   &mdash;   was that Josephine would be 
at a glance convinced   &mdash;   convicted   &mdash;   made ashamed of her 
absurd attack. A mere grain of dust. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Just a moment, please,&rdquo; he said to Miss Hallowell. 
&ldquo;I want to give you a note of introduction.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He wrote the note to Josephine Burroughs:  &ldquo;Here 
she is. I've told her you wish to talk with her about 
doing some work for you.&rdquo;  When he finished he looked 
up. She was standing at the window, gazing out upon 
the tremendous panorama of skyscrapers that makes 
New York the most astounding of the cities of men. He 
was about to speak. The words fell back unuttered. 
For once more the hallucination   &mdash;   or whatever it was   &mdash;    
laid hold of him. That figure by the window   &mdash;   that 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0086" n="71"/>  
beautiful girl, with the great dreamy eyes and the soft 
and languorous nuances of golden haze over her hair, 
over the skin of perfectly rounded cheek and perfectly 
moulded chin curving with ideal grace into the whitest 
and firmest of throats   &mdash;      &mdash;    
</p><p>&ldquo;Am I mad? or do I really see what I see?&rdquo; he 
muttered. 
</p><p>He turned away to clear his eyes for a second view, 
for an attempt to settle it whether he saw or imagined. 
When he looked again, she was observing him   &mdash;   and once 
more she was the obscure, the cipherlike Miss Hallowell, 
ten-dollar-a-week typewriter and not worth it. 
Evidently she noted his confusion and was vaguely alarmed 
by it. He recovered himself as best he could and debated 
whether it was wise to send her to Josephine. Surely 
those transformations were not altogether his own 
hallucinations; and Josephine might see, might humiliate 
him by suspecting more strongly   &mdash;    . . . Ridiculous! 
He held out the letter. 
</p><p>&ldquo;The lady to whom this is addressed wishes to see 
you. Will you go there, right away, please?  It may 
be that you'll get the chance to make some extra 
money. You've no objection, I suppose?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She took the letter hesitatingly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You will find her agreeable, I think,&rdquo; continued 
he. &ldquo;At any rate, the trip can do no harm.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She hesitated a moment longer, as if weighing what 
he had said. &ldquo;No, it will do no harm,&rdquo; she finally said. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0087" n="72"/>  
Then, with a delightful color and a quick transformation 
into a vision of young shyness, &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. 
Norman. Thank you so much.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all   &mdash;   not in the least,&rdquo; he stammered, the 
impulse strong to take the note back and ask her to 
return to her desk. 
</p><p>When the door closed behind her he rose and paced 
about the room uneasily. He was filled with disquiet, 
with hazy apprehension. His nerves were unsteady, as 
if he were going through an exhausting strain. He sat 
and tried to force himself to work. Impossible. &ldquo;What 
sort of damn fool attack is this?&rdquo; he exclaimed, pacing 
about again. He searched his mind in vain for any 
cause adequate to explain his unprecedented state. &ldquo;If 
I did not know that I was well   &mdash;   absolutely well   &mdash;   I'd 
think I was about to have an illness   &mdash;   something in the 
brain.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He appealed to that friend in any trying hour, his 
sense of humor. He laughed at himself; but his nerves 
refused to return to the normal. He rushed from his 
private office on various pretexts, each time lingered in 
the general room, talking aimlessly with Tetlow   &mdash;   and 
watching the door. When she at last appeared, he 
guiltily withdrew, feeling that everyone was observing 
his perturbation and was wondering at it and jesting 
about it. &ldquo;And what the devil am I excited about?&rdquo; 
he demanded of himself. What indeed?  He seated himself, 
rang the bell. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0088" n="73"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;If Miss Hallowell has got back,&rdquo; he said to the 
office boy, &ldquo;please ask her to come in.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I think she's gone out to lunch,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;I 
know she came in a while ago. She passed along as you 
was talking to Mr. Tetlow.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman felt himself flushing. &ldquo;Any time will do,&rdquo; 
he said, bending over the papers spread out before him 
   &mdash;   the papers in the case of the General Traction Company 
resisting the payment of its taxes. A noisome 
odor seemed to be rising from the typewritten sheets. 
He made a wry face and flung the papers aside with a 
gesture of disgust. &ldquo;They never do anything honest,&rdquo; 
he said to himself. &ldquo;From the stock-jobbing owners 
down to the nickel-filching conductors they steal   &mdash;   steal 
   &mdash;   steal!&rdquo;  And then he wondered at, laughed at, his 
heat. What did it matter?  An ant pilfering from 
another ant and a sparrow stealing the crumb found 
by another sparrow   &mdash;   a man robbing another man   &mdash;    
all part of the universal scheme. Only a narrow-minded 
ignoramus would get himself wrought up over it; a 
philosopher would laugh   &mdash;   and take what he needed or 
happened to fancy. 
</p><p>The door opened. Miss Hallowell entered, a small 
and demure hat upon her masses of thick fair hair 
arranged by anything but unskillful fingers. &ldquo;You 
wished to see me?&rdquo; came in the quiet little voice, sweet 
and frank and shy. 
</p><p>He roused himself from pretended abstraction. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0089" n="74"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh   &mdash;   it's you?&rdquo; he said pleasantly. &ldquo;They said you 
were out.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I was going to lunch. But if you've anything for 
me to do, I'll be glad to stay.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No   &mdash;   no. I simply wished to say that if Miss 
Burroughs wished to make an arrangement with you, we'd 
help you about carrying out your part of it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was pale   &mdash;   so pale that it brought out strongly 
the smooth dead-white purity of her skin. Her small 
features wore an expression of pride, of haughtiness 
even. And in the eyes that regarded him steadily there 
shone a cold light   &mdash;   the light of a proud and lonely soul 
that repels intrusion even as the Polar fastnesses push 
back without effort assault upon their solitudes. &ldquo;We 
made no arrangement,&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You are not more than eighteen, are you?&rdquo; 
inquired he abruptly. 
</p><p>The irrelevant question startled her. She looked as 
if she thought she had not heard aright. &ldquo;I am 
twenty,&rdquo; she said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You have a most   &mdash;   most unusual way of shifting 
to various ages and personalities,&rdquo; explained he, with 
some embarrassment. 
</p><p>She simply looked at him and waited. 
</p><p>His embarrassment increased. It was a novel 
sensation to him, this feeling ill at ease with a woman   &mdash;    
he who was at ease with everyone and put others at their 
ease or not as he pleased. &ldquo;I'm sorry you and Miss 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0090" n="75"/>  
Burroughs didn't arrange something. I suppose she 
found the hours difficult.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She made me an offer,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;I 
refused it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But, as I told you, we can let you off   &mdash;   anything 
within reason.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, but I do not care to do that kind of 
work. No doubt any kind of work for wages classes 
one as a servant. But those people up there   &mdash;   they make 
one <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> it   &mdash;   feel menial.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not Miss Burroughs, I assure you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>A satirical smile hovered round the girl's lips. Her 
face was altogether lovely now, and no lily ever rose 
more gracefully from its stem than did her small head 
from her slender form. &ldquo;She meant to be kind, but 
she was insulting. Those people up there don't 
understand. They're vain and narrow. Oh, I don't blame 
them. Only, I don't care to be brought into contact 
with them.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He looked at her in wonder. She talked of Josephine 
as if she were Josephine's superior, and her expression 
and accent were such that they contrived to convey an 
impression that she had the right to do it. He grew 
suddenly angry at her, at himself for listening to her. 
&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said stiffly, and took up a pen to 
indicate that he wished her to go. 
</p><p>He rather expected that she would be alarmed. But 
if she was, she wholly concealed it. She smiled slightly 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0091" n="76"/>  
and moved toward the door. Looking after her, he 
relented. She seemed so young   &mdash;   was so young   &mdash;   and 
was evidently poor. He said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;It's all right to be proud, Miss Hallowell. But 
there is such a thing as supersensitiveness. You are 
earning your living. If you'll pardon me for thrusting 
advice upon you, I think you've made a mistake. 
I'm sure Miss Burroughs meant well. If you had been 
less sensitive you'd soon have realized it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She patronized me,&rdquo; replied the girl, not angrily, 
but with amusement. &ldquo;It was all I could do not to 
laugh in her face. The idea of a woman who probably 
couldn't make five dollars a week fancying she was the 
superior of any girl who makes her own living, no matter 
how poor a living it is.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman laughed. It had often appealed to his own 
sense of humor, the delusion that the tower one happened 
to be standing upon was part of one's own stature. But 
he said:  &ldquo;You're a very foolish young person. You'll 
not get far in the world if you keep to that road. It 
winds through Poverty Swamps to the Poor House.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied she. &ldquo;One can always die.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Again he laughed. &ldquo;But why die?  Why not be 
sensible and live?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; replied she. She was looking away 
dreamily, and her eyes were wonderful to see. &ldquo;There 
are many things I feel and do   &mdash;   and I don't at all understand 
why. But   &mdash;   &rdquo;  An expression of startling resolution 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0092" n="77"/>  
flashed across her face. &ldquo;But I do them, just the 
same.&rdquo;   
</p><p>A brief silence; then, as she again moved toward the 
door, he said, &ldquo;You have been working for some time?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Four years.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You support yourself?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I work to help out father's income. He makes 
almost enough, but not quite.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Almost enough!  The phrase struck upon Norman's 
fancy as both amusing and sad. Almost enough for 
what?  For keeping body and soul together; for keeping 
body barely decently clad. Yet she was content. 
He said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;You like to work?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not yet. But I think I shall when I learn this 
business. One feels secure when one has a trade.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn't impress me as an interesting life for 
a girl of your age,&rdquo; he suggested. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I'm not unhappy. And at home, of evenings 
and Sundays, I'm happy.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Doing what?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Reading and talking with father and   &mdash;   doing the 
housework   &mdash;   and all the rest of it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>What a monotonous narrow little life!  He wanted 
to pity her, but somehow he could not. There was no 
suggestion in her manner that she was an object of 
pity. &ldquo;What did Miss Burroughs say to you   &mdash;   if I 
may ask?&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0093" n="78"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly. You sent me, and I'm much obliged 
to you. I realize it was an opportunity   &mdash;   for another 
sort of girl. I half tried to accept because I knew 
refusing was only my   &mdash;   queerness.&rdquo;  She smiled charmingly. 
&ldquo;You are not offended because I couldn't make 
myself take it?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not in the least.&rdquo;  And all at once he felt that 
it was true. This girl would have been out of place in 
service. &ldquo;What was the offer?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Suddenly before him there appeared a clever, willful 
child, full of the childish passion for imitation and 
mockery. And she proceeded to &ldquo;take off&rdquo; the grand 
Miss Burroughs   &mdash;   enough like Josephine to give the 
satire point and barb. He could see Josephine resolved 
to be affable and equal, to make this doubtless bedazzled 
stray from the &ldquo;lower classes&rdquo; feel comfortable in those 
palatial surroundings. She imitated Josephine's walk, 
her way of looking, her voice for the menials   &mdash;   gracious 
and condescending. The exhibition was clever, free from 
malice, redolent of humor. Norman laughed until the 
tears rolled down his cheeks. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You ought to go on the stage,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;How 
Josephine   &mdash;   Miss Burroughs would appreciate it!  For 
she's got a keen sense of humor.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not for the real jokes   &mdash;   like herself,&rdquo; replied Miss 
Hallowell. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You're prejudiced.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No. I see her as she is. Probably everyone else 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0094" n="79"/>  
   &mdash;   those around her   &mdash;   see her money and her clothes and 
all that. But I saw   &mdash;   just her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He nodded thoughtfully. Then he looked penetratingly 
at her. &ldquo;How did you happen to learn to do 
that?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;To see people as they are?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Father taught me.&rdquo;  Her eyes lighted up, her 
whole expression changed. She became beautiful with 
the beauty of an intense and adoring love. &ldquo;Father is 
a wonderful man   &mdash;   one of the most wonderful that ever 
lived. He   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>There was a knock at the door. She startled, he 
looked confused. Both awakened to a sense of their 
forgotten surroundings, of who and what they were. She 
went and Mr. Sanders entered. But even in his confusion 
Norman marveled at the vanishing of the fascinating 
personality who had been captivating him into forgetting 
everything else, at the reappearance of the 
blank, the pale and insignificant personality attached 
to a typewriting machine at ten dollars a week. No, 
not insignificant, not blank   &mdash;   never again that, for him. 
He saw now the full reality   &mdash;   and also why he, everyone, 
was so misled. She made him think of the surface of 
the sea when the sky is gray and the air calm. It lies 
smooth and flat and expressionless   &mdash;   inert, monotonous. 
But let sunbeam strike or breeze ever so faint start up, 
and what a commotion of unending variety!  He could 
never look at her again without being reminded of those 
infinite latent possibilities, without wondering what new 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0095" n="80"/>  
and perhaps more charming, more surprising varieties 
of look and tone and manner could be evoked. 
</p><p>And while Sanders was talking   &mdash;   prosing on and on 
about things Norman either already knew or did not 
wish to know   &mdash;   he was thinking of her. &ldquo;If she happens 
to meet a man with enough discernment to fall in 
love with her,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;he certainly will 
never weary. What a pity that such a girl shouldn't 
have had a chance, should be wasted on some unappreciative 
chucklehead of her class!  What a pity she hasn't 
ambition   &mdash;   or the quality, whatever it is   &mdash;   that makes 
those who have it get on, whether they wish or no.&rdquo; 
</p><p>During the rest of the day he revolved from time 
to time indistinct ideas of somehow giving this girl a 
chance. He wished Josephine would and could help, or 
perhaps his sister Ursula. It was not a matter that 
could be settled, or even taken up, in haste. No man 
of his mentality and experience fails to learn how perilous 
it is in the least to interfere in the destiny of anyone. 
And his notion involved not slight interference with 
advice or suggestion or momentarily extended helping 
hand, but radical change of the whole current of destiny. 
Also, he appreciated how difficult it is for a man to do 
anything for a young woman   &mdash;   anything that would not 
harm more than it would help. Only one thing seemed 
clear to him   &mdash;   the &ldquo;clever child&rdquo; ought to have a 
chance. 
</p><p>He went to see Josephine after dinner that night 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0096" n="81"/>  
His own house, while richly and showily furnished, as 
became his means and station, seemed   &mdash;   and indeed was 
   &mdash;   merely an example of simple, old-fashioned &ldquo;solid 
comfort&rdquo; in comparison with the Burroughs palace. 
He had never liked, but, being a true New Yorker, had 
greatly admired the splendor of that palace, its costly 
art junk, its rotten old tapestries, its unlovely genuine 
antiques, its room after room of tasteless magnificence, 
suggesting a museum, or rather the combination home 
and salesroom of an art dealer. This evening he found 
himself curious, critical, disposed to license a long-suppressed sense of humor. While he was waiting for 
Josephine to come down to the small salon into which 
he had been shown, her older sister drifted in, on the 
way to a late dinner and ball. She eyed him admiringly 
from head to foot. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You've <hi rend="italic">such</hi> an air, Fred,&rdquo; 
said she. &ldquo;You should 
hear the butler on the subject of you. He says that 
of all the men who come to the house you are most the 
man of the world. He says he could tell it by the way 
you walk in and take off your hat and coat and throw 
them at him.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman laughed and said, &ldquo;I didn't know. I must 
stop that.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bellowes. &ldquo;You'll break his 
heart. He adores it. You know, servants dearly love 
to be treated as servants. Anyone who thinks the world 
loves equality knows very little about human nature. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0097" n="82"/>  
Most people love to look up, just as most women love 
to be ruled. No, you must continue to be the master, 
the man of the world, Fred.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was busy with her gorgeous and trailing wraps 
and with her cigarette or she would have seen his 
confusion. He was recalling his scene with the typewriter 
girl. Not much of the man of the world, then and 
there, certainly. What a grotesque performance for a 
man of his position, for a serious man of any kind!  And 
how came he to permit such a person to mimic Josephine 
Burroughs, a lady, the woman to whom he was engaged? 
In these proud and pretentious surroundings he felt 
contemptibly guilty   &mdash;   and dazed wonder at his own 
inexplicable folly and weakness. 
</p><p>Mrs. Bellowes departed before Josephine came down. 
So there was no relief for his embarrassment. He saw 
that she too felt constrained. Instead of meeting him 
half way in embrace and kiss, as she usually did, she 
threw him a kiss and pretended to be busy lighting 
a cigarette and arranging the shades of the table lamp. 
&ldquo;Well, I saw your `poor little creature,' &rdquo; she began. 
She was splendidly direct in all her dealings, after the 
manner of people who have never had to make their own 
way   &mdash;   to cajole or conciliate or dread the consequences 
of frankness. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I told you you'd not find her interesting.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, she was a nice little girl,&rdquo; replied Josephine 
with elaborate graciousness   &mdash;   and Norman, the &ldquo;take 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0098" n="83"/>  
off&rdquo; fresh in his mind, was acutely critical of her 
manner, of her mannerisms. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she went on, 
&ldquo;one does not expect much of people of that class. But 
I thought her unusually well-mannered   &mdash;   and quite 
clean.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Tetlow makes 'em clean up,&rdquo; said Norman, a 
gleam of sarcasm in his careless glance and tone. And 
into his nostrils stole an odor of freshness and health 
and youth, the pure, sweet odor that is the base of all 
the natural perfumes. It startled him, his vivid memory 
of a feature of her which he had not been until now 
aware that he had ever noted. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I offered her some work,&rdquo; continued Josephine, 
&ldquo;but I guess you keep her too busy down there for her 
to do anything else.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;Why do you sit on 
the other side of the room?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I don't know,&rdquo; laughed Josephine. &ldquo;I feel 
queer to-night. And it seems to me you're queer, too.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I?  Perhaps rather tired, dear   &mdash;   that's all.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Did you and Miss Hallowell work hard to-day?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, bother Miss Hallowell. Let's talk about our-selves.&rdquo; 
And he drew her to the sofa at one end of the 
big fireplace. &ldquo;I wish we hadn't set the wedding so far 
off.&rdquo;  And suddenly he found himself wondering 
whether that remark had been prompted by eagerness   &mdash;    
a lover's eagerness   &mdash;   or by impatience to have the 
business over and settled. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0099" n="84"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;You don't act a bit natural to-night, Fred. You 
touch me as if I were a stranger.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I like that!&rdquo; mocked he. &ldquo;A stranger hold your 
hand like this?   &mdash;   and   &mdash;   kiss you   &mdash;   like this?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She drew away, suddenly laid her hands on his 
shoulders, kissed him upon the lips passionately, then 
looked into his eyes. &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Do</hi> you love 
me, Fred?   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">really</hi>?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why so earnest?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You've had a great deal of experience?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;More or less.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Have you ever loved any woman as you love me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've never loved any woman but you. I never 
before wanted to marry a woman.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But you may be doing it because   &mdash;   well, you might 
be tired and want to settle down.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Do you believe that?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No, I don't. But I want to hear you say it isn't 
so.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Well   &mdash;   it isn't so. Are you satisfied?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm frightfully jealous of you, Fred.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What a waste of time!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've got something to confess   &mdash;   something I'm 
ashamed of.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't confess,&rdquo; cried he, laughing but showing 
that he meant it. &ldquo;Just   &mdash;   don't be wicked again 
That's much better than confession.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I must confess,&rdquo; insisted she. &ldquo;I had evil 
 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0100" n="85"/>  
thoughts   &mdash;   evil suspicions about you. I've had them 
all day   &mdash;   until you came. As soon as I saw you I felt 
bowed into the dust. A man like you, doing anything 
so vulgar as I suspected you of   &mdash;   oh, dearest, I'm <hi rend="italic">so</hi> 
ashamed!'' 
</p><p>He put his arms round her and drew her to his 
shoulder. And the scene of mimicry in his office flashed 
into his mind, and the blood burned in his cheeks. But 
he had no such access of insanity as to entertain the 
idea of confession. 
</p><p>&ldquo;It was that typewriter girl,&rdquo; continued Josephine. 
She drew away again and once more searched his face. 
&ldquo;You told me she was homely.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not exactly that.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Insignificant then.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Isn't she?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   in a way,&rdquo; said Josephine, the condescending 
note in her voice again   &mdash;   and in his mind Miss Hallowell's 
clever burlesque of that note. &ldquo;But, in another 
way   &mdash;     Men are different from women. Now I   &mdash;   a 
woman of my sort   &mdash;   couldn't stoop to a man of her 
class. But men seem not to feel that way.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, irritated. &ldquo;They've the courage to 
take what they want wherever they find it. A man will 
take gold out of the dirt, because gold is always gold. 
But a woman waits until she can get it at a fashionable 
jeweler's, and makes sure it's made up in a fashionable 
way. I don't like to hear <hi rend="italic">you</hi> say 
those things.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0101" n="86"/>  
</p><p>Her eyes flashed. &ldquo;Then you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> like that Hallowell 
girl!&rdquo; she cried   &mdash;   and never before had her voice 
jarred upon him. 
</p><p>&ldquo;That Hallowell girl has nothing to do with this,&rdquo; 
he rejoined. &ldquo;I like to feel that you really love me   &mdash;    
that you'd have taken me wherever you happened to 
find me   &mdash;   and that you'd stick to me no matter how far 
I might drop.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I would!  I would!&rdquo; she cried, tears in her eyes. 
&ldquo;Oh, I didn't mean that, Fred. You know I didn't   &mdash;    
don't you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She tried to put her arms round his neck, but he 
took her hands and held them. &ldquo;Would you like to 
think I was marrying you for what you have?   &mdash;   or for 
any other reason whatever but for what you are?&rdquo; 
</p><p>It being once more a question of her own sex, the 
obstinate line appeared round her mouth. &ldquo;But, Fred, 
I'd not be <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, if I were   &mdash;   a working 
girl,&rdquo; she replied. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You might be something even better if you were,&rdquo; 
retorted he coldly. &ldquo;The only qualities I don't like 
about you are the surface qualities that have been 
plated on in these surroundings. And if I thought it 
was anything but just you that I was marrying, I'd 
lose no time about leaving you. I'd not let myself 
degrade myself.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Fred   &mdash;   that tone   &mdash;   and don't   &mdash;   please don't look at 
me like that!&rdquo; she begged. 
</p><p>But his powerful glance searched on. He said, &ldquo;Is 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0102"/>  
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0103"/>   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0104" n="87"/>  
it possible that you and I are deceiving ourselves   &mdash;   and 
that we'll marry and wake up   &mdash;   and be bored and 
dissatisfied   &mdash;   like so many of our friends?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No   &mdash;   no,&rdquo; she cried, wildly agitated. &ldquo;Fred, dear 
we love each other. You know we do. I don't use 
words as well as you do   &mdash;   and my mind works in a queer 
way   &mdash;     Perhaps I didn't mean what I said. No matter. 
If my love were put to the test   &mdash;   Fred, I don't ask 
anything more than that your love for me would stand 
the tests my love for you would stand.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He caught her in his arms and kissed her with more 
passion than he had ever felt for her before. &ldquo;I 
believe you, Jo,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I believe you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I love you so   &mdash;   that I could be jealous even of 
her   &mdash;   of that little girl in your office. Fred, I didn't 
confess all the truth. It isn't true that I thought her 
   &mdash;   a nobody. When she first came in here   &mdash;   it was in 
this very room   &mdash;   I thought she was as near nothing 
as any girl I'd ever seen. Then she began to change   &mdash;    
as you said. And   &mdash;   oh, dearest, I can't help hating her! 
And when I tried to get her away from you, and she 
wouldn't come   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Away from me!&rdquo; he cried, laughing. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I felt as if it were like that,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;And 
she wouldn't come   &mdash;   and treated me as if she were queen 
and I servant   &mdash;   only politely, I must say, for Heaven 
knows I don't want to injure her   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Shall I have her discharged?&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0105" n="88"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Fred!&rdquo; exclaimed she indignantly. &ldquo;Do you 
think I could do such a thing?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She'd easily get another job as good. Tetlow 
can find her one. Does that satisfy you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;It makes me feel meaner 
than ever.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Now, Jo, let's drop this foolish seriousness about 
nothing at all. Let's drop it for good.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing at all   &mdash;   that's exactly it. I can't 
understand, Fred. What is there about her that makes her 
haunt me?  That makes me afraid she'll haunt you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman felt a sudden thrill. He tightened his hold 
upon her hands because his impulse had been to release 
them. &ldquo;How absurd!&rdquo; he said, rather noisily. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Isn't it, though?&rdquo; echoed she. &ldquo;Think of you 
and me almost quarreling about such a trivial person.&rdquo; 
Her laugh died away. She shivered, cried, &ldquo;Fred, I'm 
superstitious about her. I'm   &mdash;   I'm   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">afraid!</hi>&rdquo;  And she 
flung herself wildly into his arms. 
</p><p>&ldquo;She <hi rend="italic">is</hi> somewhat uncanny,&rdquo; 
said he, with a 
lightness he was far from feeling. &ldquo;But, dear   &mdash;   it isn't 
complimentary to me, is it?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Forgive me, dearest   &mdash;   I don't mean that. I 
couldn't mean that. But   &mdash;   I <hi rend="italic">love</hi> you 
so. Ever since I 
began to love you I've been looking round for something 
to be afraid of. And this is the first chance 
you've given me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">I've</hi> given you!&rdquo; mocked he. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0106" n="89"/>  
</p><p>She laughed hysterically. &ldquo;I mean the first chance 
I've had. And I'm doing the best I can with it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>They were in good spirits now, and for the rest of 
the evening were as loverlike as always, the nearer 
together for the bit of rough sea they had weathered so 
nicely. Neither spoke of Miss Hallowell. Each had 
privately resolved never to speak of her to the other 
again. Josephine was already regretting the frankness 
that had led her to expose a not too attractive part of 
herself   &mdash;   and to exaggerate in his eyes the importance 
of a really insignificant chit of a typewriter. When he 
went to bed that night he was resolved to have Tetlow 
find Miss Hallowell a job in another office. 
</p><p>&ldquo;She certainly <hi rend="italic">is</hi> uncanny,&rdquo; 
he said to himself. &ldquo;I 
wonder why   &mdash;   I wonder what the secret of her is. She's 
the first woman I ever ran across who had a real secret. 
<hi rend="italic">Is</hi> it real?  I wonder.&rdquo;</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="5" id="d11"> 
<head>V</head> 
<p>TOWARD noon the following day Norman, suddenly 
in need of a stenographer, sent out for Miss Purdy, one 
of the three experts at eighteen dollars a week who 
did most of the important and very confidential work 
for the heads of the firm. When his door opened again 
he saw not Miss Purdy but Miss Hallowell. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Purdy is sick to-day,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Mr. 
Tetlow wishes to know if I would do.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman shifted uneasily in his chair. &ldquo;Just as 
well   &mdash;   perfectly   &mdash;   certainly,&rdquo; he stammered. He was not 
looking at her   &mdash;   seemed wholly occupied with the business 
he was preparing to dispatch. 
</p><p>She seated herself in the usual place, at the opposite 
side of the broad table. With pencil poised she fixed 
her gaze upon the unmarred page of her open notebook. 
Instead of abating, his confusion increased. He could 
not think of the subject about which he wished to 
dictate. First, he noted how long her lashes were   &mdash;   and 
darker than her hair, as were her well-drawn eyebrows 
also. Never had he seen so white a skin or one so 
smooth. She happened to be wearing a blouse with a 
Dutch neck that day. What a superb throat!  What 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0108" n="91"/>  
a line of beauty its gently swelling curve made. Then 
his glance fell upon her lips, rosy-red, slightly pouted. 
And what masses of dead gold hair   &mdash;   no, not gold, but 
of the white-gray of wood ashes, and tinted with gold! 
No wonder it was difficult to tell just what color her 
hair was. Hair like that was ready to be of any color. 
And there were her arms, so symmetrical in her rather 
tight sleeves, and emerging into view in the most delicate 
wrists. What a marvelous skin! 
</p><p>&ldquo;Have you ever posed?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She startled and the color flamed in her cheeks. Her 
eyes shot a glance of terror at him. &ldquo;I   &mdash;   I,&rdquo; she 
stammered. Then almost defiantly, &ldquo;Yes, I did   &mdash;   for a while. 
But I didn't suppose anyone knew. At the time we 
needed the money badly.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman felt deep disgust with himself for bursting 
out with such a question, and for having surprised her 
secret. &ldquo;There's nothing to be ashamed of,&rdquo; he said 
gently. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I'm not ashamed,&rdquo; she returned. Her agitation 
had subsided. &ldquo;The only reason I quit was because 
the work was terribly hard and the pay small and 
uncertain. I was confused because they discharged me 
at the last place I had, when they found out I had been 
a model. It was a church paper office.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Again she poised her pencil and lowered her eyes. 
But he did not take the hint. &ldquo;Is there anything you 
would rather do than this sort of work?&rdquo; he asked. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0109" n="92"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing I could afford,&rdquo; replied she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;If you had been kind to Miss Burroughs yesterday 
she would have helped you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn't afford to do that,&rdquo; said the girl in her 
quiet, reticent way. 
</p><p>&ldquo;To do what?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;To be nice to anyone for what I could get out 
of it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman smiled somewhat cynically. Probably the 
girl fancied she was truthful; but human beings rarely 
knew anything about their real selves. &ldquo;What would 
you like to do?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She did not answer his question until she had shrunk 
completely within herself and was again thickly veiled 
with the expression which made everyone think her 
insignificant. &ldquo;Nothing I could afford to do,&rdquo; said she. 
It was plain that she did not wish to be questioned 
further along that line. 
</p><p>&ldquo;The stage?&rdquo; he persisted. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I hadn't thought of it,&rdquo; was her answer. 
</p><p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't think about things I can't have. I never 
made any definite plans.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But isn't it a good idea always to look ahead?  As 
long as one has to be moving, one might as well move in 
a definite direction.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was waiting with pencil poised. 
</p><p>&ldquo;There isn't much of a future at this business.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0110" n="93"/>  
</p><p>She shrank slightly. He felt that she regarded his 
remark as preparation for a kindly hint that she was 
not giving satisfaction. . . . Well, why not leave it that 
way?  Perhaps she would quit of her own accord   &mdash;    
would spare him the trouble   &mdash;   and embarrassment   &mdash;   of 
arranging with Tetlow for another place for her. He 
began to dictate   &mdash;   gave her a few sentences mockingly 
different from his usual terse and clear statements   &mdash;    
interrupted himself with: 
</p><p>&ldquo;You misunderstood me a while ago. I didn't 
mean you weren't doing your work well. On the 
contrary, I think you'll soon be expert. But I thought 
perhaps I might be able to help you to something you'd 
like better.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He listened to his own words in astonishment. What 
new freak of madness was this?  Instead of clearing 
himself of this uncanny girl, he was proposing things 
to her that would mean closer relations. And what 
reason had he to think she was fitted for anything but 
just what she was now doing   &mdash;   doing indifferently well? 
</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, so quietly that it seemed 
coldly, &ldquo;but I'm satisfied as I am.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her manner seemed to say with polite and restrained 
plainness that she was not in the least appreciative of 
his interest or of himself. But this could not be. No girl 
in her position could fail to be grateful for his interest. 
No woman, in all his life, had ever failed to respond to 
his slightest advance. No, it simply could not be. She 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0111" n="94"/>  
was merely shy, and had a peculiar way of showing it. 
He said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;You have no ambition?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's not for a woman.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was making her replies as brief as civility 
permitted. He observed her narrowly. She was not shy, 
not embarrassed. What kind of game was this?  It 
could not be in sincere nature for a person in her position 
thus to treat overtures, friendly and courteous overtures, 
from one in his position. And never before   &mdash;    
never   &mdash;   had a woman been thus unresponsive. Instead 
of feeling relief that she had disentangled him from the 
plight into which his impulsive offer had flung him, he 
was piqued   &mdash;   angered   &mdash;   and his curiosity was inflamed 
as never before about any woman. 
</p><p>The relations of the sexes are for the most part 
governed by traditions of sex allurements and sex tricks 
so ancient that they have ceased to be conscious and 
have become instinctive. One of these venerable first 
principles is that mystery is the arch provoker. Norman, 
an old and expert student of the great game   &mdash;   the 
only game for which the staidest and most serious will 
abandon all else to follow its merry call   &mdash;   Norman knew 
this trick of mystery. The woman veils herself and 
makes believe to fly   &mdash;   an excellent trick, as good to-day 
as ever after five thousand years of service. And he 
knew that in it lay the explanation for the sudden and 
high upflaming of his interest in this girl. &ldquo;What an 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0112" n="95"/>  
ass I'm making of myself!&rdquo; reflected he. &ldquo;When I 
care nothing about the girl, why should I care about 
the mystery of her?  Of course, it's some poor little 
affair, a puzzle not worth puzzling out.&rdquo; 
</p><p>All true and clear enough. Yet seeing it did not 
abate his interest a particle. She had veiled herself; 
she was pretending   &mdash;   perhaps honestly   &mdash;   to fly. He 
rose and went to the window, stood with his back to 
her, resumed dictating. But the sentences would not 
come. He whirled abruptly. &ldquo;I'm not ready to do the 
thing yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll send for you later.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Without a word or a glance she stood, took her book 
and went toward the door. He gazed after her. He 
could not refrain from speaking again. &ldquo;I'm afraid 
you misunderstood my offer a while ago,&rdquo; said he, 
neither curt nor friendly. &ldquo;I forgot how such things 
from a man to a young woman might be misinterpreted.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I never thought of that,&rdquo; replied she unembarrassed. 
&ldquo;It was simply that I can't put myself under 
obligation to anyone.&rdquo; 
</p><p>As she stood there, her full beauty flashed upon 
him   &mdash;   the exquisite form, the subtly graceful poise of 
her body, of her head   &mdash;   the loveliness of that golden-hued white skin   &mdash;   the charm of her small rosy mouth   &mdash;    
the delicate, sensitive, slightly tilted nose   &mdash;   and her eyes 
   &mdash;   above all, her eyes!   &mdash;   so clear, so sweet. Her voice 
had seemed thin and faint to him; its fineness now seemed 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0113" n="96"/>  
the rarest delicacy   &mdash;   the exactly fitting kind for so 
evasive and delicate a beauty as hers. He made a slight 
bow of dismissal, turned abruptly away. Never in all 
his life, strewn with gallant experiences   &mdash;   never had a 
woman thus treated him, and never had a woman thus 
affected him. &ldquo;I am mad   &mdash;   stark mad!&rdquo; he muttered. 
&ldquo;A ten-dollar-a-week typewriter, whom nobody on earth 
but myself would look at a second time!&rdquo;  But something 
within him hurled back this scornful fling. 
Though no one else on earth saw or appreciated   &mdash;   what 
of it?  She affected <hi rend="italic">him</hi> thus   &mdash;   and 
that was enough. 
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> want her! . . . I <hi rend="italic">want</hi> her!  I have never wanted a 
woman before.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He rushed into the dressing room attached to his 
office, plunged his face into ice-cold water. This somewhat 
eased the burning sensation that was becoming 
intolerable. Many were the unaccountable incidents in 
his acquaintance with this strange creature; the most 
preposterous was this sudden seizure. He realized now 
that his feeling for her had been like the quiet, steady, 
imperceptible filling of a reservoir that suddenly 
announces itself by the thunder and roar of a mighty 
cascade over the dam. &ldquo;This is madness   &mdash;   sheer madness! 
I am still master within myself. I will make 
short work of this rebellion.&rdquo;  And with an air of 
calmness so convincing that he believed in it he addressed 
himself to the task of sanity and wisdom lying plain 
before him. &ldquo;A man of my position caught by a girl 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0114" n="97"/>  
like that!  A man such as I am, caught by <hi rend="italic">any</hi> woman 
whatever!&rdquo;  It was grotesque. He opened his door to 
summon Tetlow. 
</p><p>The gate in the outside railing was directly 
opposite, and about thirty feet away. Tetlow and Miss 
Hallowell were going out   &mdash;   evidently to lunch together. 
She was looking up at the chief clerk with laughing 
eyes   &mdash;   they seemed coquettish to the infuriated Norman. 
And Tetlow   &mdash;   the serious and squab young ass was 
gazing at her with the expression men of the stupid 
squab sort put on when they wish to impress a woman. 
At this spectacle, at the vision of that slim young 
loveliness, that perfect form and deliciously smooth soft 
skin, white beyond belief beneath its faintly golden tint 
   &mdash;   the hot blood steamed up into Norman's brain, blinded 
his sight, reddened it with desire and jealousy. He 
drew back, closed his door with a bang. 
</p><p>&ldquo;This is not I,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;What has 
happened?  Am I insane?&rdquo; 
 
</p><p>When Tetlow returned from lunch the office boy on 
duty at the gate told him that Mr. Norman wished to 
see him at once. Like all men trying to advance along 
ways where their fellow men can help or hinder, the head 
clerk was full of more or less clever little tricks thought 
out with a view to making a good impression. One of 
them was to stamp upon all minds his virtue of promptness   &mdash;    
of what use to be prompt unless you forced every 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0115" n="98"/>  
one to feel how prompt you were?  He went in to see 
Norman, with hat in hand and overcoat on his back and 
one glove off, the other still on. Norman was standing 
at a window, smoking a cigarette. His appearance   &mdash;    
dress quite as much as manner   &mdash;   was the envy of his 
subordinate   &mdash;   as, indeed, it was of hundreds of the 
young men struggling to rise down town. It was so 
exactly what the appearance of a man of vigor and 
power and high position should be. Tetlow practiced 
it by the quarter hour before his glass at home   &mdash;   not 
without progress in the direction of a not unimpressive 
manner of his own. 
</p><p>As Tetlow stood at attention, Norman turned and 
advanced toward him. &ldquo;Mr. Tetlow,&rdquo; he began, in his 
good-humored voice with the never wholly submerged 
under-note of sharpness, &ldquo;is it your habit to go out to 
lunch with the young ladies employed here?  If so, I 
wish to suggest   &mdash;   simply to suggest   &mdash;   that it may be 
bad for discipline.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow's jaw dropped a little. He looked at 
Norman, was astonished to discover beneath a thin veneer of 
calm signs of greater agitation than he had ever seen in 
him. &ldquo;To-day was the first time, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And 
I can't quite account for my doing it. Miss Hallowell 
has been here several months. I never specially noticed 
her until the last few days   &mdash;   when the question of 
discharging her came up. You may remember it was 
settled by you.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0116" n="99"/>  
Norman flung his cigarette away and stalked to the 
window. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Norman,&rdquo; pursued Tetlow, &ldquo;you and I have 
been together many years. I esteem it my greatest 
honor that I am able   &mdash;   that you permit me   &mdash;   to class 
you as my friend. So I'm going to give you a confidence   &mdash;    
one that really startles me. I called on Miss 
Hallowell last night.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman's back stiffened. 
</p><p>&ldquo;She is even more charming in her own home. 
And   &mdash;   &rdquo;  Tetlow blushed and trembled   &mdash;   &ldquo;I am going 
to make her my wife if I can.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman turned, a mocking satirical smile unpleasantly 
sparkling in his eyes and curling his mouth 
&ldquo;Old man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think you've gone crazy.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow made a helpless gesture. &ldquo;I think so 
myself. I didn't intend to marry for ten years   &mdash;   and then 
   &mdash;   I had quite a different match in mind.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What's the matter with you, Billy?&rdquo; inquired 
Norman, inspecting him with smiling, cruelly unfriendly 
eyes. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm damned if I know, Norman,&rdquo; said the head 
clerk, assuming that his friend was sympathetic and 
dropping into the informality of the old days when they 
were clerks together in a small firm. &ldquo;I'd have 
proposed to her last night if I hadn't been afraid I'd lose 
her by being in such a hurry. . . . You're in love yourself.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0117" n="100"/>  
</p><p>Norman startled violently. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You're going to get married. Probably you can 
sympathize. You know how it is to meet the woman 
you want and must have.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman turned away. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've had   &mdash;   or thought I had   &mdash;   rather advanced 
ideas on the subject of women. I've always had a horror 
of being married for a living or for a home or as 
an experiment or a springboard. My notion's been 
that I wouldn't trust a woman who wasn't independent. 
And theoretically I still think that's sound. But it 
doesn't work out in practice. A man has to have been 
in love to be able to speak the last word on the sex question.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman dropped heavily into his desk chair and 
rumpled his hair into disorder. He muttered something 
   &mdash;   the head clerk thought it was an oath. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'd marry her,&rdquo; Tetlow went on, &ldquo;if I knew she 
was simply using me in the coldest, most calculating 
way. My only fear is that I shan't be able to get her 
   &mdash;   that she won't marry me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman sneered. &ldquo;That's not likely,&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;No, it isn't,&rdquo; admitted Tetlow. &ldquo;They   &mdash;   the 
Hallowells   &mdash;   are nice people   &mdash;   of as good family as there 
is. But they're poor   &mdash;   very poor. There's only her 
father and herself. The old man is a scientist   &mdash;   spends 
most of his time at things that won't pay a cent   &mdash;   utterly 
impractical. A gentleman   &mdash;   an able man, if a 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0118" n="101"/>  
little cracked   &mdash;   at least he seemed so to me who don't 
know much about scientific matters. But getting poorer 
steadily. So I think she will accept me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>A gloomy, angry frown, like a black shadow, passed 
across Norman's face and disappeared. &ldquo;You'd marry 
her   &mdash;   on those terms?&rdquo; he sneered. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> for better 
terms   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman sprang up, strode to the window and turned 
his back. 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I'm prepared for the worst. The fact is, she 
treats me as if she didn't care a rap for the honor of 
my showing her attention.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;A trick, Billy. An old trick.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe so. But   &mdash;    I really believe she doesn't 
realize. She's queer   &mdash;   has been queerly brought up. Yes, 
I think she doesn't appreciate. Then, too, she's young 
and light   &mdash;   almost childish in some ways. . . . I don't 
blame you for being disgusted with me, Fred. But   &mdash;    
damn it, what's a man to do?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Cure himself!&rdquo; exploded Norman, wheeling 
violently on his friend. &ldquo;You must act like a man. Billy, 
such a marriage is ruin for you. How can we take you 
into partnership next year?  When you marry, you 
must marry in the class you're moving toward, not in 
any of those you're leaving behind.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Do you suppose I haven't thought of all that?&rdquo; 
rejoined Tetlow bitterly. &ldquo;But I can't help myself. 
It's useless for me to say I'll try. I shan't try.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0119" n="102"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't you want to get over this?&rdquo; demanded 
Norman fiercely. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Of course   &mdash;     No   &mdash;   I don't. Fred, you'd think 
better of me if you knew her. You've never especially 
noticed her. She's beautiful.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman dropped to his chair again. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Really   &mdash;   beautiful,&rdquo; protested Tetlow, assuming 
that the gesture was one of disgusted denial. &ldquo;Take 
a good look at her, Norman, before you condemn her. 
I never was so astonished as when I discovered how 
good-looking she is. I don't quite know how it is, but I 
suppose nobody ever happened to see how   &mdash;   how lovely 
she is until I just chanced to see it.&rdquo;  At a rudely 
abrupt gesture from Norman he hurried on, eagerly 
apologetic, &ldquo;And if you talk with her   &mdash;     She's very 
reserved. But she's the lady through and through   &mdash;    
and has a good mind. . . . At least, I think she has. 
I'll admit a man in love is a poor judge of a woman's 
mind. But, anyhow, I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> she's 
lovely to look at. 
You'll see it yourself, now that I've called your attention 
to it. You can't fail to see it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman threw himself back in his chair and clasped 
his hands behind his head. &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Why</hi> do 
you want to 
marry her?&rdquo; he inquired, in a tone his sensitive ear 
approved as judicial. 
</p><p>&ldquo;How can I tell?&rdquo; replied the head clerk irritably. 
&ldquo;Does a man ever know?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Always   &mdash;   when he's sensibly in love.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0120" n="103"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;But when he's just in love?  That's what ails 
me,&rdquo; retorted Tetlow, with a sheepish look and laugh. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Billy, you've got to get over this. I can't let 
you make a fool of yourself.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow's fat, smooth, pasty face of the overfed, 
underexercised professional man became a curious 
exhibit of alarm and obstinacy. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You've got to promise me you'll keep away from 
her   &mdash;   except at the office   &mdash;   for say, a week. Then   &mdash;    
we'll see.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow debated. 
</p><p>&ldquo;It's highly improbable that anyone else will 
discover these irresistible charms. There's no one else 
hanging round?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No one, as I told you the other day, when you 
questioned me about her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman shifted, looked embarrassed. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I hope I didn't give you the impression I was 
ashamed of loving her or would ever be ashamed of 
her anywhere?&rdquo; continued Tetlow, a very loverlike light 
in his usually unromantic eyes. &ldquo;If I did, it wasn't 
what I meant   &mdash;   far from it. You'll see, when I marry 
her, Norman. You'll be congratulating me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman sprang up again. &ldquo;This is plain lunacy, 
Tetlow. I am amazed at you   &mdash;   amazed!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Get acquainted with her, Mr. Norman,&rdquo; pleaded 
the subordinate. &ldquo;Do it, to oblige me. Don't 
condemn us   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0121" n="104"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;I wish to hear nothing more!&rdquo; cried Norman 
violently. &ldquo;Another thing. You must find her a place 
in some other office   &mdash;   at once.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You're right, sir,&rdquo; assented Tetlow. &ldquo;I can 
readily do that.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman scowled at him, made an imperious gesture 
of dismissal. Tetlow, chopfallen but obdurate, got 
himself speedily out of sight. 
</p><p>Norman, with hands deep in his pockets, stared out 
among the skyscrapers and gave way to a fit of remorse. 
It was foreign to his nature to do petty underhanded 
tricks. Grand strategy   &mdash;   yes. At that he was an adept, 
and not the shiftiest, craftiest schemes he had ever 
devised had given him a moment's uneasiness. But to be 
driving a ten-dollar-a-week typewriter out of her job 
   &mdash;   to be maneuvering to deprive her of a for her brilliant 
marriage   &mdash;   to be lying to an old and loyal retainer who 
had helped Norman full as much and as often as Norman 
had helped him   &mdash;   these sneaking bits of skullduggery 
made him feel that he had sunk indeed. But he ground 
his teeth together and his eyes gleamed wickedly. &ldquo;He 
shan't have her, damn him!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;She's not 
for him.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He summoned Tetlow, who was obviously low in 
mind as the result of revolving the things that had been 
said to him. &ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; he began in a tone so amiable 
that he was ashamed for himself, &ldquo;you'll not forget I 
have your promise?&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0122" n="105"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;What did I promise?&rdquo; cried Tetlow, his voice 
shrill with alarm. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not to see her, except at the office, for a week.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I've promised her father I'd call this evening. 
He's going to show me some experiments.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You can easily make an excuse   &mdash;   business.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I don't want to,&rdquo; protested the head clerk. 
&ldquo;What's the use?  I've got my mind made up. Norman, 
I'd hang on after her if you fired me out of this 
office for it. And I can't rest   &mdash;   I'm fit for nothing   &mdash;    
until this matter's settled. I came very near taking 
her aside and proposing to her, just after I went out 
of here a while ago.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You <hi rend="italic">damn</hi> fool!&rdquo; cried 
Norman, losing all control 
of himself. &ldquo;Take the afternoon express for Albany 
instead of Harcott and attend to those registrations 
and arrange for those hearings. I'll do my best to 
save you. I'll bring the girl in here and keep her at 
work until you get out of the way.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow glanced at his friend; then the tears came 
into his eyes. &ldquo;You're a hell of a friend!&rdquo; he 
ejaculated. &ldquo;And I thought you'd sympathize because you 
were in love.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I do sympathize, Billy,&rdquo; Norman replied with an 
abrupt change to shamefaced apology. &ldquo;I sympathize 
more than you know. I feel like a dog, doing this. 
But it can't result in any harm, and I want you to get 
a little fresh air in that hot brain of yours before you 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0123" n="106"/>  
commit yourself. Be reasonable, old man. Suppose 
you rushed ahead and proposed   &mdash;   and she accepted   &mdash;   and 
then, after a few days, you came to. What about her? 
You must act on the level, Tetlow. Do the fair thing 
by yourself and by her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman had often had occasion to feel proud of the 
ingenuity and resourcefulness of his brain. He had 
never been quite so proud as he was when he finished 
that speech. It pacified Tetlow; it lightened his own 
sense of guilt; it gave him a respite. 
</p><p>Tetlow rewarded Norman with the look that in New 
York is the equivalent of the handclasp friend seeks 
from friend in times of stress. &ldquo;You're right, Fred. 
I'm much obliged to you. I haven't been considering 
<hi rend="italic">her</hi> side of it enough. A man ought 
always to think 
of that. The women   &mdash;   poor things   &mdash;   have a hard enough 
time to get on, at best.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman's smile was characteristically cynical. 
Sentimentality amused him. &ldquo;I doubt if there are more 
female wrecks than male wrecks scattered about the 
earth,&rdquo; rejoined he. &ldquo;And I suspect the fact isn't 
due to the gentleness of man with woman, either. Don't 
fret for the ladies, Tetlow. They know how to take 
care of themselves. They know how to milk with a sure 
and a steady hand. You may find it out by depressing 
experience some day.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow saw the aim. His obstinate, wretched 
expression came back. &ldquo;I don't care. I've got   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0124" n="107"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;You went over that ground,&rdquo; interrupted Norman 
impatiently. &ldquo;You'd better be catching the train.&rdquo; 
</p><p>As Tetlow withdrew, he rang for an office boy and 
sent him to summon Miss Hallowell. 
</p><p>Norman had been reasoning with himself   &mdash;   with the 
aid of the self that was both better and more worldly 
wise. He felt that his wrestlings had not been wholly 
futile. He believed he had got the strength to face the 
girl with a respectful mind, with a mind resolute in 
duty   &mdash;   if not love   &mdash;   toward Josephine Burroughs. &ldquo;I 
<hi rend="italic">love</hi> Josephine,&rdquo; he said to himself.  
&ldquo;My feeling for 
this girl is some sort of physical attraction. I certainly 
shall be able to control it enough to keep it within 
myself. And soon it will die out. No doubt I've felt 
much the same thing as strongly before. But it didn't 
take hold because I was never bound before   &mdash;   never had 
the sense of the necessity for restraint. That sense is 
always highly dangerous for my sort of man.&rdquo; 
</p><p>This sounded well. He eyed the entering girl coldly, 
said in a voice that struck him as excellent indifference, 
&ldquo;Bring your machine in here, Miss Hallowell, and recopy 
these papers. I've made some changes. If you 
spoil any sheets, don't throw them away, but return 
everything to me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm always careful about the waste-paper baskets,&rdquo; 
said she, &ldquo;since they warned me that there are men 
who make a living searching the waste thrown out of 
offices.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0125" n="108"/>  
</p><p>He made no reply. He could not have spoken if 
he had tried. Once more the spell had seized him   &mdash;   the 
spell of her weird fascination for him. As she sat 
typewriting, with her back almost toward him, he sat watching 
her and analyzing his own folly. He knew that 
diagnosing a disease does not cure it; but he found an 
acute pleasure in lingering upon all the details of the 
effect she had upon his nerves. He did not dare move 
from his desk, from the position that put a huge table 
and a revolving case of reference books between them. 
He believed that if he went nearer he would be unable 
to resist seizing her in his arms and pouring out the 
passion that was playing along his nerves as the delicate, 
intense flame flits back and forth along the surface of 
burning alcohol. 
</p><p>A knock at the door. He plunged into his papers. 
&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he called. 
</p><p>Tetlow thrust in his head. Miss Hallowell did not 
look up. &ldquo;I'm off,&rdquo; the head clerk said. His gaze 
was upon the unconscious girl   &mdash;   a gaze that filled Norman 
with longing to strangle him. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Telegraph me from Albany as soon as you get 
there,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;Telegraph me at my club.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow was gone. The machine tapped monotonously 
on. The barette which held the girl's hair at 
the back was so high that the full beauty of the nape 
of her neck was revealed. That wonderful white skin 
with the golden tint!  How soft   &mdash;   yet how firm   &mdash;   her 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0126" n="109"/>  
flesh looked!  How slender yet how strong was her 
build   &mdash;      &mdash;    
</p><p>&ldquo;How do you like Tetlow?&rdquo; he asked, because 
speak to her he must. 
</p><p>She glanced up, turned in her chair. He quivered 
before the gaze from those enchanting eyes of hers. &ldquo;I 
beg pardon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I didn't hear.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Tetlow   &mdash;   how do you like him?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;He is very kind to me   &mdash;   to everyone.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;How did your father like him?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He confidently expected some sign of confusion, but 
there was no sign. &ldquo;Father was delighted with him,&rdquo; 
she said merrily. &ldquo;He took an interest in the work 
father's doing   &mdash;   and that was enough.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was about to turn back to her task. He 
hastened to ask another question. &ldquo;Couldn't I meet your 
father some time?  What Tetlow told me interested 
me greatly.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Father would be awfully pleased,&rdquo; replied she. 
&ldquo;But   &mdash;   unless you really care about   &mdash;   biology, I don't 
think you'd like coming.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm interested in everything interesting,&rdquo; replied 
Norman dizzily. What was he saying?  What was he 
doing?  What folly was his madness plunging him into? 
</p><p>&ldquo;You can come with Mr. Tetlow when he gets back.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'd prefer to talk with him alone,&rdquo; said Norman. 
&ldquo;Perhaps I might see some way to be of service to 
him.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0127" n="110"/>  
</p><p>Her expression was vividly different from what it 
had been when he offered to help <hi rend="italic">her</hi>.  
She became radiant 
with happiness. &ldquo;I do hope you'll come,&rdquo; she said 
   &mdash;   her voice very low and sweet, in the effort she was 
making to restrain yet express her feelings. 
</p><p>&ldquo;When?  This evening?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;He's always at home.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You'll be there?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm always there, too. We have no friends. It's 
not easy to make acquaintances in the East   &mdash;   congenial 
acquaintances.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'd want you to be there,&rdquo; he explained with great 
care, &ldquo;because you could help him and me in getting 
acquainted.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, he'll talk freely   &mdash;   to anyone. He talks only 
the one subject. He never thinks of anything else.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was resting her crossed arms on the back of her 
chair and, with her chin upon them, was looking at him 
   &mdash;   a childlike pose and a childlike expression. He said: 
&ldquo;You are <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> you are twenty?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She smiled gayly. &ldquo;Nearly twenty-one.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Old enough to be in love.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She lifted her head and laughed. She had charming 
white teeth   &mdash;   small and sharp and with enough irregularity 
to carry out her general suggestion of variability. 
&ldquo;Yes, I shall like that, when it comes,&rdquo; she said; 
&ldquo;But the chances are against it just now.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;There's Tetlow.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0128" n="111"/>  
</p><p>She was much amused. &ldquo;Oh, he's far too old and 
serious.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman felt depressed. &ldquo;Why, he's only thirty-five.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I'm not twenty-one,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;I'd 
want some one of my own age. I'm tired of being so 
solemn. If I had love, I'd expect it to change all that.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Evidently a forlorn and foolish person   &mdash;   and doubtless 
thinking of him, two years the senior of Tetlow 
and far more serious, as an elderly person, in the same 
class with her father. &ldquo;But you like biology?&rdquo; he said. 
The way to a cure was to make her talk on. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't know anything about it,&rdquo; said she, looking 
as frivolous as a butterfly or a breeze-bobbed blossom. 
&ldquo;I listen to father, but it's all beyond me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Yes   &mdash;   a light-weight. They could have nothing in 
common. She was a mere surface   &mdash;   a thrillingly beautiful 
surface, but not a full-fledged woman. So little did 
conversation with him interest her, she had taken 
advantage of the short pause to resume her work. No, 
she had not the faintest interest in him. It wasn't a 
trick of coquetry; it was genuine. He whom women had 
always bowed before was unable to arouse in her a spark 
of interest. She cared neither for what he had nor 
for what he was, in himself. This offended and wounded 
him. He struggled sulkily with his papers for half an 
hour. Then he fell to watching her again and   &mdash;      &mdash;    
</p><p>&ldquo;You must not neglect to give me your address,&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0129" n="112"/>  
he said. &ldquo;Write it on a slip of paper after you finish. 
I might forget it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she replied, but did not turn round. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why, do you think, did Tetlow come to see you?&rdquo; 
he asked. He felt cheapened in his own eyes   &mdash;   he, the 
great man, the arrived man, the fianc&eacute; of Josephine 
Burroughs, engaged in this halting and sneaking flirtation! 
But he could not restrain himself. 
</p><p>She turned to answer. &ldquo;Mr. Tetlow works very 
hard and has few friends. He had heard of my father 
and wanted to meet him   &mdash;   just like you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; murmured Norman, in confusion. &ldquo;I 
thought   &mdash;   perhaps   &mdash;   he was interested in <hi rend="italic">you</hi>.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She laughed outright   &mdash;   and he had an entrancing 
view of the clean rosy interior of her mouth. &ldquo;In <hi rend="italic">me</hi>? 
   &mdash;   Mr. Tetlow?  Why, he's too serious and important 
for a girl like me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then he bored you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no. I like him. He is a good man   &mdash;    
thoroughly good.&rdquo; 
</p><p>This pleased Norman immensely. It may be fine to 
be good, but to be called good   &mdash;   that is somehow a 
different matter. It removes a man at once from the 
jealousy-provoking class. &ldquo;Good exactly describes him,&rdquo; 
said Norman. &ldquo;He wouldn't harm a fly. In love he'd 
be ridiculous.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not with a woman of his own age and kind,&rdquo; 
protested she. &ldquo;But I'm neglecting my work.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0130" n="113"/>  
</p><p>And she returned to it with a resolute manner that 
made him ashamed to interrupt again   &mdash;   especially after 
the unconscious savage rebukes she had administered. 
He sat there fighting against the impulse to watch her 
   &mdash;   denouncing himself   &mdash;   appealing to pride, to shame, to 
prudence   &mdash;   to his love for Josephine   &mdash;   to the sense of 
decency that restrains a hunter from aiming at a harmless 
tame song bird. But all in vain. He concentrated 
upon her at last, stared miserably at her, filled with 
longing and dread and shame   &mdash;   and longing, and yet 
more longing. 
</p><p>When she finished and stood at the other side of 
the desk, waiting for him to pass upon her work, she 
must have thought he was in a profound abstraction. 
He did not speak, made a slight motion with his hand 
to indicate that she was to go. Shut in alone, he 
buried his face in his arms. &ldquo;What madness!&rdquo; he 
groaned. &ldquo;If I loved her, there'd be some excuse for 
me. But I don't. I couldn't. Yet I seem ready to 
ruin everything, merely to gratify a selfish whim   &mdash;   an 
insane whim.&rdquo; 
</p><p>On top of the papers she had left he saw a separate 
slip. He drew it toward him, spread it out before him. 
Her address. An unknown street in Jersey City! 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'll not go,&rdquo; he said aloud, pushing the slip away. 
Go?  Certainly not. He had never really meant to go. 
He would, of course, keep his engagement with Josephine. 
&ldquo;And I'll not come down town until she has taken 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0131" n="114"/>  
another job and has caught Tetlow. I'll stop this idiocy 
of trying to make an impression on a person not worth 
impressing. What weak vanity   &mdash;   to be piqued by this 
girl's lack of interest!&rdquo; 
</p><p>Nevertheless   &mdash;   he at six o'clock telephoned to the 
Burroughs' house that he was detained down town. He 
sent away his motor, dined alone in the station restaurant 
in Jersey City. And at half past seven he set out 
in a cab in search of   &mdash;   what?  He did not dare answer 
that interrogation.</p>

<p>LIKE many another chance explorer from New York, 
Norman was surprised to discover that, within a few 
minutes of leaving the railway station, his cab was 
moving through a not unattractive city. He expected to 
find the Hallowells in a tenement in some more or less 
squalid street overhung with railway smoke and bedaubed 
with railway grime. He was delighted when the 
driver assured him that there was no mistake, that the 
comfortable little cottage across the width of the 
sidewalk and a small front yard was the sought-for 
destination. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, please,&rdquo; he said to the cabman. &ldquo;Or, if you 
like, you can go to that corner saloon down there. I'll 
know where to find you.&rdquo;  And he gave him half a 
dollar. 
</p><p>The cabman hesitated between two theories of this 
conduct   &mdash;   whether it was the generosity it seemed or 
was a ruse to &ldquo;side step&rdquo; payment. He   &mdash;   or his thirst 
   &mdash;   decided for the decency of human nature; he drove 
confidingly away. Norman went up the tiny stoop and 
rang. The sound of a piano, in the room on the ground 
floor where there was light, abruptly ceased. The door 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0133" n="116"/>  
opened and Miss Hallowell stood before him. She was 
throughout a different person from the girl of the office. 
She had changed to a tight-fitting pale-blue linen dress 
made all in one piece. Norman could now have not an 
instant's doubt about the genuineness, the bewitching 
actuality, of her beauty. The wonder was how she 
could contrive to conceal so much of it for the purposes 
of business. It was a peculiar kind of beauty   &mdash;   not the 
radiant kind, but that which shines with a soft glow 
and gives him who sees it the delightful sense of being 
its original and sole discoverer. An artistic eye   &mdash;   or an 
eye that discriminates in and responds to feminine 
loveliness   &mdash;   would have been captivated, as it searched in 
vain for flaw. 
</p><p>If Norman anticipated that she would be nervous 
before the task of receiving in her humbleness so 
distinguished a visitor, he must have been straightway 
disappointed. Whether from a natural lack of that 
sense of social differences which is developed to the most 
pitiful snobbishness in New York or from her youth and 
inexperience, she received him as if he had been one of 
the neighbors dropping in after supper. And it was 
Norman who was ill at ease. Nothing is more 
disconcerting to a man accustomed to be received with 
due respect to his importance than to find himself put 
upon the common human level and compelled to &ldquo;make 
good&rdquo; all over again from the beginning. He felt   &mdash;    
he knew   &mdash;   that he was an humble candidate for her 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0134" n="117"/>  
favor   &mdash;   a candidate with the chances perhaps against 
him. 
</p><p>The tiny parlor had little in it beside the upright 
piano because there was no space. But the paper, the 
carpet and curtains, the few pieces of furniture, showed 
no evidence of bad taste, of painful failure at the effort 
to &ldquo;make a front.&rdquo;  He was in the home of poor people, 
but they were obviously people who made a highly 
satisfactory best of their poverty. And in the midst of it 
all the girl shone like the one evening star in the mystic 
opalescence of twilight. 
</p><p>&ldquo;We weren't sure you were coming,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I'll 
call father. . . . No, I'll take you back to his workshop. 
He's easier to get acquainted with there.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Won't you play something for me first?  Or   &mdash;    
perhaps you sing? &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;A very little,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;Not worth 
hearing.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm sure I'd like it. I want to get used to my 
surroundings before I tackle the   &mdash;   the biology.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Without either hesitation or shyness, she seated herself 
at the piano. &ldquo;I'll sing the song I've just learned.&rdquo; 
And she began. Norman moved to the chair that gave 
him a view of her in profile. For the next five minutes 
he was witness to one of those rare, altogether charming 
visions that linger in the memory in freshness and 
fragrance until memory itself fades away. She sat 
very straight at the piano, and the position brought 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0135" n="118"/>  
out all the long lines of her figure   &mdash;   the long, round 
white neck and throat, the long back and bosom, the 
long arms and legs   &mdash;   a series of lovely curves. It has 
been scientifically demonstrated that pale blue is preeminently  
the sex color. It certainly was pre&euml;minently 
<hi rend="italic">her</hi> color, setting off each and every 
one of her charms 
and suggesting the roundness and softness and whiteness 
her drapery concealed. She was one of those rare 
beings whose every pose is instinct with grace. And 
her voice   &mdash;     It was small, rather high, at times almost 
shrill. But in every note of its register there sounded 
a mysterious, melancholy-sweet call to the responding 
nerves of man. 
</p><p>Before she got halfway through the song Norman 
was fighting against the same mad impulse that had all 
but overwhelmed him as he watched her in the afternoon. 
And when her last note rose, swelled, slowly 
faded into silence, it seemed to him that had she kept 
on for one note more he would have disclosed to her 
amazed eyes the insanity raging within him. 
</p><p>She turned on the piano stool, her hands dropped 
listlessly in her lap. &ldquo;Aren't those words beautiful?&rdquo; 
she said in a dreamy voice. She was not looking at 
him. Evidently she was hardly aware of his presence. 
</p><p>He had not heard a word. He was in no mood for 
mere words. &ldquo;I've never liked anything so well,&rdquo; he 
said. And he lowered his eyes that she might not see 
what they must be revealing. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0136" n="119"/>  
</p><p>She rose. He made a gesture of protest. &ldquo;Won't 
you sing another?&rdquo; he asked. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not after that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It's the best I know. 
It has put me out of the mood for the ordinary songs.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You are a dreamer   &mdash;   aren't you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's my real life,&rdquo; replied she. &ldquo;I go through 
the other part just to get to the dreams.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What do you dream?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She laughed carelessly. &ldquo;Oh, you'd not be 
interested. It would seem foolish to you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You're mistaken there,&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;The only 
thing that ever has interested me in life is dreams   &mdash;    
and making them come true.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But not <hi rend="italic">my</hi> kind of dreams.  
The only kind I like 
are the ones that couldn't possibly come true.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;There isn't any dream that can't be made to come 
true.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She looked at him eagerly. &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;The wildest ones are often the easiest.&rdquo;  He had 
a moving voice himself, and it had been known to affect 
listening ears hypnotically when he was deeply in earnest, 
was possessed by one of those desires that conquer 
men of will and then make them irresistible instruments. 
&ldquo;What is your dream?   &mdash;   happiness? . . . love?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She gazed past him with swimming eyes, with a 
glance that seemed like a brave bright bird exploring 
infinity. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said under her breath. &ldquo;But it 
could never   &mdash;   never come true. It's too perfect.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0137" n="120"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't doubt,&rdquo; he said, in a tone that fitted her 
mood as the rhythm of the cradle fits the gentle breathing 
of the sleeping child. &ldquo;Don't ever doubt. And the 
dream will come true.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You have been in love?&rdquo; she said, under the spell 
of his look and tone. 
</p><p>He nodded slowly. &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he replied, and he was 
under the spell of her beauty. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Is it   &mdash;   wonderful?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Like nothing else on earth. Everything else seems 
   &mdash;   poor and cheap   &mdash;   beside it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He drew a step nearer. &ldquo;But you couldn't love   &mdash;    
not yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You haven't had the experience. 
You will have to learn.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You don't know me,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I have been 
teaching myself ever since I was a little girl. I've 
thought of nothing else most of the time. Oh   &mdash;   &rdquo; she 
clasped her white hands against her small bosom   &mdash;   &ldquo;if 
I ever have the chance, how much I shall give!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I know it!  I know it!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You will 
make some man happier than ever man was before.&rdquo; 
His infatuation did not blind him to the fact that she 
cared nothing about him, looked on him in the most 
unpersonal way. But that knowledge seemed only to 
inflame him the more, to lash him on to the folly of an 
ill-timed declaration. &ldquo;I have felt how much you will 
give   &mdash;   how much you will love   &mdash;   I've felt it from the 
second time I saw you   &mdash;   perhaps from the first. I've 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0138" n="121"/>  
never seen any woman who interested me as you do   &mdash;    
who drew me as you do   &mdash;   against my ambition   &mdash;   against 
my will. I   &mdash;   I   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>He had been fighting against the words that would 
come in spite of him. He halted now because the food 
of emotion suffocated speech. He stood before her, 
ghastly pale and trembling. She did not draw back. 
She seemed compelled by his will, by the force of his 
passion, to stay where she was. But in her eyes was a 
fascinated terror   &mdash;   a fear of him   &mdash;   of the passion that 
dominated him, a passion like the devils that made men 
gash themselves and leap from precipices into the sea. 
To unaccustomed eyes the first sight of passion is 
always terrifying and is usually repellent. One must 
learn to adventure the big wave, the great hissing, 
towering billow that conceals behind its menace the wild 
rapture of infinite longing realized. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I have frightened you?&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was her whispered reply. 
</p><p>&ldquo;But it is your dream come true.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She shrank back   &mdash;   not in aversion, but gently. &ldquo;No 
   &mdash;   it isn't my dream,&rdquo; she replied. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You don't realize it yet, but you will.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She shook her head positively. &ldquo;I couldn't ever 
think of you in that way.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He did not need to ask why. She had already 
explained when they were talking of Tetlow. There was 
a finality in her tone that filled him with despair. It 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0139" n="122"/>  
was his turn to look at her in terror. What power 
this slim delicate girl had over him!  What a price 
she could exact if she but knew!  Knew?  Why, he had 
told her   &mdash;   was telling her in look and tone and gesture 
   &mdash;   was giving himself frankly into captivity   &mdash;   was prostrate, 
inviting her to trample. His only hope of escape 
lay in her inexperience   &mdash;   that she would not realize. In 
the insanities of passion, as in some other forms of 
dementia, there is always left a streak of reason   &mdash;   of 
that craft which leads us to try to get what we want 
as cheaply as possible. Men, all but beside themselves 
with love, will bargain over the terms, if they be of the 
bargaining kind by nature. Norman was not a haggler. 
But common prudence was telling him how unwise his 
conduct was, how he was inviting the defeat of his own 
purposes. 
</p><p>He waved his hand impatiently. &ldquo;We'll see, my 
dear,&rdquo; he said with a light good-humored laugh. &ldquo;I 
mustn't forget that I came to see your father.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She looked at him doubtfully. She did not understand   &mdash;    
did not quite like   &mdash;   this abrupt change of mood. 
It suggested to her simplicity a lack of seriousness, of 
sincerity. &ldquo;Do you really wish to see my father?&rdquo; 
she inquired. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why else should I come away over to Jersey 
City?  Couldn't I have talked with you at the office?&rdquo; 
</p><p>This seemed convincing. She continued to study his 
face for light upon the real character of this strange 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0140" n="123"/>  
new sort of man. He regarded her with a friendly 
humorous twinkle in his eyes. &ldquo;Then I'll take you to 
him,&rdquo; she said at length. She was by no means satisfied, 
but she could not discover why she was dissatisfied. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I can't possibly do you any harm,&rdquo; he urged, with 
raillery. 
</p><p>&ldquo;No, I think not,&rdquo; replied she gravely. &ldquo;But 
you mustn't say those things!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;  Into his eyes came their strongest, 
most penetrating look. &ldquo;I want you. And I don't 
intend to give you up. It isn't my habit to give up. 
So, sooner or later I get what I go after.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You make me   &mdash;   afraid,&rdquo; she said nervously. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; laughed he. &ldquo;Not of me, certainly. 
Then it must be of yourself. You are afraid you will 
end by wanting me to want you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No   &mdash;   not that,&rdquo; declared she, confused by his quick 
cleverness of speech. &ldquo;I don't know what I'm afraid 
of.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then let's go to your father. . . . You'll not tell 
Tetlow what I've said?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;  And once more her simple negation gave 
him a sense of her absolute truthfulness. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Or that I've been here?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She looked astonished. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh   &mdash;   office reasons. It wouldn't do for the others 
to know.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She reflected on this. &ldquo;I don't understand,&rdquo; was 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0141" n="124"/>  
the result of her thinking. &ldquo;But I'll do as you ask. 
Only, you must not come again.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?  If they knew at the office, they'd 
simply talk   &mdash;   unpleasantly.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she admitted hesitatingly after reflecting. 
&ldquo;So you mustn't come again. I don't like some kinds 
of secrets.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But your father will know,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Isn't 
that enough for   &mdash;   for propriety?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I can't explain. I don't understand, myself. I 
do a lot of things by instinct.&rdquo;  She, standing with her 
hands behind her back and with clear, childlike eyes 
gravely upon him, looked puzzled but resolved. &ldquo;And 
my instinct tells me not to do anything secret about 
you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>This answer made him wonder whether after all he 
might not be too positive in his derisive disbelief in 
women's instincts. He laughed. &ldquo;Well   &mdash;   now for your 
father.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The workshop proved to be an annex to the rear, 
reached by a passage leading past a cosy little dining 
room and a kitchen where the order and the shine of 
cleanness were notable even to masculine eyes. &ldquo;You 
are well taken care of,&rdquo; he said to her   &mdash;   she was preceding 
him to show the way. 
</p><p>&ldquo;We take care of ourselves,&rdquo; replied she. &ldquo;I get 
breakfast before I leave and supper after I come home. 
Father has a cold lunch in the middle of the day, when 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0142" n="125"/>  
he eats at all   &mdash;   which isn't often. And on Saturday 
afternoons and Sundays I do the heavy work.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You <hi rend="italic">are</hi> a busy lady!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, not so very busy. Father is a crank about 
system and order. He has taught me to plan everything 
and work by the plans.&rdquo; 
</p><p>For the first time Norman had a glimmer of real 
interest in meeting her father. For in those remarks 
of hers he recognized at once the rare superior man   &mdash;    
the man who works by plan, where the masses of mankind 
either drift helplessly or are propelled by some 
superior force behind them without which they would 
be, not the civilized beings they seem, but even as the 
savage in the dugout or as the beast of the field. The 
girl opened a door; a bright light streamed into the 
dim hallway. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Here's Mr. Norman.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman saw, beyond the exquisite profile of the 
girl's head and figure, a lean tallish old man, dark and 
gray, whose expression proclaimed him at first glance 
no more in touch with the affairs of active life in the 
world than had he been an inhabitant of Mars. 
</p><p>Mr. Hallowell gave his caller a polite glance and 
handshake   &mdash;   evidence of merest surface interest in him, 
of amiable patience with an intruder. Norman saw in 
the neatness of his clothing and linen further proof 
of the girl's loving care. For no such abstracted 
personality as this would ever bother about such things 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0143" n="126"/>  
for himself. These details, however, detained Norman 
only for a moment. In the presence of Hallowell it 
was impossible not to concentrate upon him. 
</p><p>As we grow older what we are inside, the kind of 
thoughts we admit as our intimates, appears ever more 
strongly in the countenance. This had often struck 
Norman, observing the men of importance about him, 
noting how as they aged the look of respectability, of 
intellectual distinction, became a thinner and ever thinner 
veneer over the selfishness and greediness, the vanity and 
sensuality and falsehood. But never before had he been 
so deeply impressed by its truth. Evidently Hallowell 
during most of his fifty-five or sixty years had lived 
the purely intellectual life. The result was a look of 
spiritual beauty, the look of the soul living in the high 
mountain, with serenity and vast views constantly before 
it. Such a face fills with awe the ordinary follower 
of the petty life of the world if he have the brains to 
know or to suspect the ultimate truth about existence. 
It filled Norman with awe. He hastily turned his eyes 
upon the girl   &mdash;   and once more into his face came the 
resolute, intense, white-hot expression of a man 
doggedly set upon an earthy purpose. 
</p><p>There was an embarrassed silence. Then the girl 
said, &ldquo;Show him the worms, father.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Mr. Hallowell smiled. &ldquo;My little girl thinks no one 
has seen that sort of thing,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I can't make 
her believe it is one of the commonplaces.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0144" n="127"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;You've never had anyone here more ignorant than 
I, sir,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;The only claim on your courtesy 
I can make is that I'm interested and that I perhaps 
know enough in a general way to appreciate.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Hallowell waved his hand toward a row of large 
glass bottles on one of the many shelves built against 
the rough walls of the room. &ldquo;Here they are,&rdquo; said 
he. &ldquo;It's the familiar illustration of how life may be 
controlled.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't understand,&rdquo; said Norman, eying the 
bottled worms curiously. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it's simply the demonstration that life is a 
mere chemical process   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman had ceased to listen. The girl was moving 
toward the door by which they had entered   &mdash;   was in the 
doorway   &mdash;   was gone!  He stood in an attitude of 
attention; Hallowell talked on and on, passing from one 
thing to another, forgetting his caller and himself, 
thinking only of the subject, the beloved science, that 
has brought into the modern world a type of men like 
those who haunted the deserts and mountain caves in 
the days when Rome was falling to pieces. With those 
saintly hermits of the Dark Ages religion was the all-absorbing subject. And seeking their own salvation 
was the goal upon which their ardent eyes were necessarily 
bent. With these modern devotees, science   &mdash;   the 
search for the truth about the world in which they live 
   &mdash;   is their religion; and their goal is the redemption of 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0145" n="128"/>  
the world. They are resolved   &mdash;   step by step, each 
worker contributing his mite of discovery   &mdash;   to transform 
the world from a hell of discomfort and pain and death 
to a heaven where men and women, free and enlightened 
and perhaps immortal, shall live in happiness. 
They even dream that perhaps this race of gods shall 
learn to construct the means to take them to another 
and younger planet, when this Earth has become too 
old and too cold and too nakedly clad in atmosphere 
properly to sustain life. 
</p><p>From time to time Norman caught a few words of 
what Hallowell said   &mdash;   words that made him respect the 
intelligence that had uttered them. But he neither 
cared nor dared to listen. He refused to be deflected 
from his one purpose. When he was as old as Hallowell, 
it would be time to think of these matters. When 
he had snatched the things he needed, it would be time 
to take the generous, wide, philosopher view of life. 
But not yet. He was still young; he could   &mdash;   and he 
would!   &mdash;   drink of the sparkling heady life of the senses, 
typefied now for him in this girl. How her loveliness 
flamed in his blood   &mdash;   flamed as fiercely when he could 
not see the actual, tangible charms as when they were 
radiating their fire into his eyes and through his skin! 
First he must live that glorious life of youth, of nerves 
aquiver with ecstasy. Also, he must shut out the things 
of the intellect   &mdash;   must live in brain as well as in body 
the animal life   &mdash;   in brain the life of cunning and 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0146" n="129"/>  
strategy. For the intellectual life would make it 
impossible to pursue such ignoble things. First, material 
success and material happiness. Then, in its own time, 
this intellectual life to which such men as Hallowell ever 
beckon, from their heights, such men as Norman, deep 
in the wallow that seems to them unworthy of them, even 
as they roll in it. 
</p><p>As soon as there came a convenient pause in Hallowell's 
talk, Norman said, &ldquo;And you devote your whole 
life to these things?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Hallowell's countenance lost its fine glow of enthusiasm. 
&ldquo;I have to make a living. I do chemical analyses 
for doctors and druggists. That takes most of my 
time.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But you can dispatch those things quickly.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Hallowell shook his head. &ldquo;There's only one way 
to do things. My clients trust me. I can't shirk.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman smiled. He admired this simplicity. But 
it amused him, too; in a world of shirking and shuffling, 
not to speak of downright dishonesty, it struck the 
humorous note of the incongruous. He said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;But if you could give all your time you would 
get on faster.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   if I had the time   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 
the money. To make 
the search exhaustive would take money   &mdash;   five or six 
thousand a year, at the least. A great deal more than 
I shall ever have.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Have you tried to interest capitalists?&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0147" n="130"/>  
</p><p>Hallowell smiled ironically. &ldquo;There is much talk 
about capitalists and capital opening up things. But 
I have yet to learn of an instance of their touching 
anything until they were absolutely sure of large profits. 
Their failed enterprises are not miscarriage of noble 
purpose but mistaken judgment, judgment blinded by 
hope and greed.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I see that a philosopher can know life without 
living it,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;But couldn't you put your 
scheme in such a way that some capitalist would be led 
to hope?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'd have to tell them the truth. Possibly I might 
discover something with commercial value, but I couldn't 
promise. I don't think it is likely.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman's eyes were on the door. His thoughts 
were reaching out to the distant and faint sound of a 
piano. &ldquo;Just what do you propose to search for?&rdquo; 
inquired he. 
</p><p>He tried to listen, because it was necessary that he 
have some knowledge of Hallowell's plans. But he 
could not fix his attention. After a few moments he 
glanced at his watch, interrupted with, &ldquo;I think I 
understand enough for the present. I've stayed longer 
than I intended. I must go now. When I come again 
I may perhaps have some plan to propose.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Plan?&rdquo; exclaimed Hallowell, his eyes lighting up. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm not sure   &mdash;   not at all sure,&rdquo; hastily added 
Norman. &ldquo;I don't wish to give you false hopes. The 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0148" n="131"/>  
matter is extremely difficult. But I'll try. I've small 
hope of success, but I'll try.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;My daughter didn't explain to me,&rdquo; said the 
scientist. &ldquo;She simply said one of the gentlemen for 
whom she worked was coming to look at my place. I 
thought it was mere curiosity.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;So it was, Mr. Hallowell,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;But 
I have been interested. I don't as yet see what can be 
done. I'm only saying that I'll think it over.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Hallowell. He was trying 
to seem calm and indifferent. But his voice had the 
tremulous note of excitement in it and his hands fumbled 
nervously, touching evidence of the agitated gropings 
of his mind in the faint, perhaps illusory, light of a new-sprung hope. &ldquo;Yes, I understand perfectly. Still   &mdash;    
it is pleasant to think about such a thing, even if there's 
no chance of it. I am very fond of dreaming. That 
has been my life, you know.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman colored, moved uneasily. The fineness of 
this man's character made him uncomfortable. He could 
pity Hallowell as a misguided failure. He could dilate 
himself as prosperous, successful, much the more 
imposing and important figure in the contrast. Yet there 
was somehow a point of view at which, if one looked 
carefully, his own sort of man shriveled and the Hallowell 
sort towered. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be going,&rdquo; Norman 
said. &ldquo;No   &mdash;   don't 
come with me. I know the way. I've interrupted you 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0149" n="132"/>  
long enough.&rdquo;  And he put out his hand and, by those 
little clevernesses of manner which he understood so 
well, made it impossible for Hallowell to go with him 
to Dorothy. 
</p><p>He was glad when he shut the door between him and 
her father. He paused in the hall to dispel the vague, 
self-debasing discomfort   &mdash;   and listening to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> voice as 
she sang helped wonderfully. There is no more trying 
test of a personality than to be estimated by the voice 
alone. That test produces many strange and startling 
results. Again and again it completely reverses our 
judgment of the personality, either destroys or 
enhances its charm. The voice of this girl, floating out 
upon the quiet of the cottage   &mdash;   the voice, soft and sweet, 
full of the virginal passion of dreams unmarred by 
experience   &mdash;     It was while listening to her voice, as he 
stood there in the dimly lighted hall, that Frederick 
Norman passed under the spell in all its potency. In 
taking an an&aelig;sthetic there is the stage when we reach 
out for its soothing effects; then comes the stage when 
we half desire, half fear; then a stage in which fear is 
dominant, and we struggle to retain our control of the 
senses. Last comes the stage when we feel the full 
power of the drug and relax and yield or are beaten 
down into quiet. Her voice drew him into the final 
stage, was the blow of the overwhelming wave's crest 
that crushed him into submission. 
</p><p>She glanced toward the door. He was leaning 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0150" n="133"/>  
there, an ominous calm in his pale, resolute face. She 
gazed at him with widening eyes. And her look was 
the look of helplessness before a force that may, indeed 
must, be struggled against, but with the foregone 
certainty of defeat. 
</p><p>A gleam of triumph shone in his eyes. Then his 
expression changed to one more conventional. &ldquo;I 
stopped a moment to listen, on my way out,&rdquo; said he. 
</p><p>Her expression changed also. The instinctive, 
probably unconscious response to his look faded into the 
sweet smile, serious rather than merry, that was her 
habitual greeting. &ldquo;Mr. Tetlow didn't get away from 
father so soon.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I stayed longer than I intended. I found it even 
more interesting than I had expected. . . . Would you 
be glad if your father could be free to do as he likes 
and not be worried about anything?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That is one of my dreams.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it's certainly one that might come true. . . . 
And you   &mdash;     It's a shame that you should have to do so 
much drudgery   &mdash;   both here and in New York.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I don't mind about myself. It's all I'm fit 
for. I haven't any talent   &mdash;   except for dreaming.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And for making   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">some</hi> man's 
dreams come true.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her gaze dropped. And as she hid herself she 
looked once more almost as insignificant and colorless 
as he had once believed her to be. 
</p><p>&ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0151" n="134"/>  
</p><p>She shook her head slowly without raising her eyes 
or emerging from the deep recess of her reserve. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You are a mystery to me. I can't decide whether 
you are very innocent or very   &mdash;   concealing.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She glanced inquiringly at him. &ldquo;I don't understand,&rdquo; 
she said. 
</p><p>He smiled. &ldquo;No more do I. I've seen so much of 
faking   &mdash;   in women as well as in men   &mdash;   that it's hard for 
me to believe anyone is genuine.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think I am trying to deceive you?  About 
what?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He made an impatient gesture   &mdash;   impatience with his 
credulity where she was concerned. &ldquo;No matter. I 
want to make you happy   &mdash;   because I want you to make 
me happy.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her eyes became as grave as a wondering child's. 
&ldquo;You are laughing at me,&rdquo; she said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Because I could not make you happy.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What could a serious man like you find in me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>His intense, burning gaze held hers. &ldquo;Some time 
I will tell you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She shut herself within herself like a flower folding 
away its beauty and leaving exposed only the 
underside of its petals. It was impossible to say 
whether she understood or was merely obeying an instinct. 
</p><p>He watched her a moment in silence. Then he said: 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0152" n="135"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;I am mad about you   &mdash;   mad. You <hi rend="italic">must</hi> understand. 
I can think only of you. I am insane with jealousy 
of you. I want you   &mdash;   I must have you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He would have seized her in his arms, but the look 
of sheer amazement she gave him protected her where 
no protest or struggle would. &ldquo;You?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Did 
you really mean it?  I thought you were just talking.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Can't you see that I mean it?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   you look as if you did. But I can't believe 
it. I could never think of you in that way.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Once more that frank statement of indifference 
infuriated him. He <hi rend="italic">must</hi> compel her to 
feel   &mdash;   he must 
give that indifference the lie   &mdash;   and at once!  He caught 
her in his arms. He rained kisses upon her pale face. 
She made not the least resistance, but seemed dazed. 
&ldquo;I will teach you to love me,&rdquo; he cried, drunk now with 
the wine of her lips, with the perfume of her exquisite 
youth. &ldquo;I will make you happy. We shall be mad 
with happiness.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She gently freed herself. &ldquo;I don't believe I could 
ever think of you in that way.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, darling   &mdash;   you will. You can't help loving 
where you are loved so utterly.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She gazed at him wonderingly   &mdash;   the puzzled wonder 
of a child. &ldquo;You   &mdash;   love   &mdash;   me?&rdquo; she said slowly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Call it what you like. I am mad about you. I 
have forgotten everything   &mdash;   pride   &mdash;   position   &mdash;   things 
you can't imagine   &mdash;   and I care for nothing but you.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0153" n="136"/>  
</p><p>And again he was kissing her with the soft fury of 
fire; and again she was submitting with the passive, 
dazed expression that seemed to add to his passion. To 
make her feel!  To make her respond!  He, whom so 
many women had loved   &mdash;   women of position, of fame for 
beauty, of social distinction or distinction as singers, 
players   &mdash;   women of society and women of talent all 
kinds of worth-while women   &mdash;   they had cared, had run 
after him, had given freely all he had asked and more. 
And this girl   &mdash;   nobody at all   &mdash;   she had nothing for him. 
</p><p>He held her away from him, cried angrily:  &ldquo;What 
is the matter with you?  What is the matter with me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't understand,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wish you 
wouldn't kiss me so much.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He released her, laughed satirically. &ldquo;Oh   &mdash;   you are 
playing a game. I might have known.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't understand,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;A while ago you 
said you loved me. Now you act as if you didn't like 
me at all.&rdquo;  And she smiled gayly at him, pouting her 
lips a little. Once more her beauty was shining. It 
made his nerves quiver to see the color in her pure 
white skin where he had kissed her. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't care whether it is a game or not,&rdquo; he 
cried. And he was about to seize her again, when she 
repulsed him. He crushed her resistance, held her 
tight in his arms. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You frighten me,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;You   &mdash;   hurt 
me.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0154" n="137"/>  
</p><p>He released her. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he cried. 
&ldquo;Don't you care at all?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I like you   &mdash;   very much. I have from 
the first time I saw you. But you seem older   &mdash;   and 
more serious.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind about that. We are going to love 
each other   &mdash;   and I am going to make you and your 
father happy.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;If you make father happy I will do anything for 
you. I don't want anything myself   &mdash;   but he is getting 
old and sometimes his despair is terrible.&rdquo;  There were 
tears in her voice   &mdash;   tears and the most touching tenderness. 
&ldquo;He has some great secret that he wants to discover, 
and he is afraid he will die without having had 
the chance.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You will love me if I make your father happy?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He knew it was the question of a fool, but he so 
longed to hear from her lips some word to give him 
hope that he could not help asking it. She said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;Love you as   &mdash;   as you seem to love me?  Not that 
same way. I don't feel that way toward you. But I 
will love you in my own way.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He observed her with penetrating eyes. Was this 
speech of hers innocence or calculation?  He could get 
no clue to the truth. He saw nothing but innocence; 
the teaching of experience warned him to believe in 
nothing but guile. He hid his doubt and chagrin behind 
a mocking smile. &ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0155" n="138"/>  
will do my part. Then   &mdash;   we'll see. . . . Do you care 
about anyone else   &mdash;   in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> way of 
loving, I mean?&rdquo; 
</p><p>It was again the question of an infatuated fool, and 
put in an infatuated fool's way. For, if she were a &ldquo;deep 
one,&rdquo; how could he hope to get the truth?  But her 
answer reassured him. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said   &mdash;   her simple, 
direct negation that had a convincing power he had 
never seen equaled. 
</p><p>&ldquo;If I ever knew of another man's touching you,&rdquo; 
he said, &ldquo;I'd feel like strangling him.&rdquo;  He laughed 
at himself. &ldquo;Not that I should strangle him. That 
sort of thing isn't done any more. But I'd do 
something devilish.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I haven't promised not to kiss anyone else,&rdquo; 
she said. &ldquo;Why should I?  I don't love you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He looked at her strangely. &ldquo;But you're going to 
love me,&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>She shrank within herself again. She looked at him 
with uneasy eyes. &ldquo;You won't kiss me any more until 
I tell you that I do love you?&rdquo; she asked with the 
gravity and pathos and helplessness of a child. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't you want to learn to love me?   &mdash;   to learn to 
love?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was silent   &mdash;   a silence that maddened him. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't be afraid to speak,&rdquo; he said irritably. 
&ldquo;What are you thinking?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That I don't want you to kiss me   &mdash;   and that I do 
want father to be happy.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0156" n="139"/>  
</p><p>Was this guile?  Was it innocence?  He put his 
arms round her. &ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>She gazed at him frankly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You like me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why don't you want me to kiss you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't know. It makes me   &mdash;   dislike you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He released her. She laid her hand on his arm 
eagerly. &ldquo;Please   &mdash;   &rdquo; she implored. &ldquo;I don't mean 
to hurt you. I wouldn't offend you for anything. Only 
   &mdash;   when you ask me a question   &mdash;   mustn't I tell you the 
truth?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Always,&rdquo; he said, believing in her, in spite of the 
warnings of cynical worldliness. &ldquo;I don't know whether 
you are sincere or not   &mdash;   as yet. So for the present 
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.&rdquo;  He stood back 
and looked at her from head to foot. &ldquo;You are beautiful!   &mdash;    
perfect,&rdquo; he said in a low voice. He laughed. 
&ldquo;I'll resist the temptation to kiss you again. I must 
go now. About your father   &mdash;   I'll see what can be done.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She stood with her hands behind her back, looking 
up at him with an expression he could not fathom. Suddenly 
she advanced, put up her lips and said gravely, 
</p><p>&ldquo;Won't you kiss me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He eyed her quizzically. &ldquo;Oh   &mdash;   you've changed 
your mind? &rdquo; 
</p><p>She shook her head. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then why do you ask me to kiss you? &rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0157" n="140"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Because of what you said about father.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He laughed and kissed her. And then she, too, 
laughed. He said, &ldquo;Not for my own sake   &mdash;   not a little 
bit?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;when you kiss me that way. 
I like to be kissed. I am very affectionate.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He laughed again. &ldquo;You <hi rend="italic">are</hi> a 
queer one. If it's 
a game, it's a good one. Is it a game?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said she gayly. &ldquo;Good night. 
This is dreadfully late for me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; he said, and they shook hands. &ldquo;Do 
you like me better   &mdash;   or less?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Better,&rdquo; was her prompt, apparently honest reply. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Curiously enough, I'm beginning to <hi rend="italic">like</hi> you,&rdquo; 
said he. &ldquo;Now don't ask me what I mean by that. 
If you don't know already, you'll not find out from me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, but I do know,&rdquo; cried she. &ldquo;The way you 
kissed me   &mdash;   that was one thing. The way you feel 
toward me now   &mdash;   that's a different thing. Isn't it so?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly. I see we are going to get on.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed.&rdquo; 
</p><p>They shook hands again in friendliest fashion, and 
she opened the front door for him. And her farewell 
smile was bright and happy.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="7" id="d13"> 
<head>VII</head> 
<p>IN the cold clear open he proceeded to take the 
usual account of stock   &mdash;   with dismal results. She had 
wound him round her fingers, had made him say only 
the things he should not have said, and leave unsaid 
the things that might have furthered his purposes. He 
had conducted the affair ridiculously   &mdash;   &ldquo;just what is 
to be expected of an infatuated fool.&rdquo;  However, there 
was no consolation in the discovery that he was reduced, 
after all these years of experience, to the common level 
   &mdash;   man weak and credulous in his dealings with woman. 
He hoped that his disgust with himself would lead on 
to disgust, or, rather, distaste for her. It is the primal 
instinct of vanity to dislike and to shun those who have 
witnessed its humiliation. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I believe I am coming to my senses,&rdquo; he said. And 
he ventured to call her up before him for examination 
and criticism. This as he stood upon the forward deck 
of the ferry with the magnificent panorama of New 
York before him. New York!  And he, of its strong 
men, of the few in all that multitude who had rank 
and power   &mdash;   he who had won as his promised wife the 
daughter of one of the dozen mighty ones of the nation! 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0159" n="142"/>  
What an ill-timed, what an absurd, what a crazy step-down this excursion of his!  And for what?  There he 
summoned her before him. And at the first glance of his 
fancy at her fair sweet face and lovely figure, he quailed. 
He was hearing her voice again. He was feeling the 
yield of her smooth, round form to his embrace, the 
yield of her smooth white cheek to his caress. In his 
nostrils was the fragrance of her youth, the matchless 
perfume of nature, beyond any of the distillations of 
art in its appeal to his normal and healthy nerves. And 
he burned with the fire only she could quench. &ldquo;I must 
   &mdash;   I must.   &mdash;   My God, I <hi rend="italic">must!</hi>&rdquo; he 
muttered. 
</p><p>When he reached home, he asked whether his sister 
was in. The butler said that Mrs. Fitzhugh had just 
come from the theater. In search of her, he went to the 
library, found her seated there with a book and a 
cigarette, her wrap thrown back upon her chair. 
&ldquo;Come out to supper with me, Ursula,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm 
starved and bored.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why, you're not dressed!&rdquo; exclaimed his sister. 
&ldquo;I thought you were at the Cameron dance with 
Josephine.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Had to cut it out,&rdquo; replied he curtly. &ldquo;Will 
you come?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I can't eat, but I'll drink. Yes, let's have a spree. 
It's been years since we had one   &mdash;   not since we were 
poor. Let's not go to a <hi rend="italic">deadly</hi> 
respectable place. Let's 
go where there are some of the other kind, too.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0160" n="143"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;But I must have food. Why not the Martin?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That'll do   &mdash;   though I'd prefer something a little 
farther up Broadway.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;The Martin is gay enough. The truth is, there's 
nothing really gay any more. There's too much money. 
Money suffocates gayety.&rdquo; 
</p><p>To the Martin they went, and he ordered an enormous 
supper   &mdash;   one of those incredible meals for which 
he was famous. They dispatched a quart of champagne 
before the supper began to come, he drinking at least 
two thirds of it. He drank as much while he was eating 
   &mdash;   and called for a third bottle when the coffee was 
served. He had eaten half a dozen big oysters, a whole 
guinea hen, a whole portion of salad, another of Boniface 
cheese, with innumerable crackers. 
</p><p>&ldquo;If I could eat as you do!&rdquo; sighed Ursula 
enviously. &ldquo;Yet it's only one of your accomplishments.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm not eating much nowadays,&rdquo; said he gloomily. 
&ldquo;I'm losing my appetite.&rdquo;  And he lit a long black 
cigar and swallowed half a large glass of the champagne. 
&ldquo;Nothing tastes good   &mdash;   not even champagne.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;There <hi rend="italic">is</hi> something wrong with 
you,&rdquo; said Ursula. 
&ldquo;Did you ask me out for confidences, or for advice   &mdash;    
or for both?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;None of them,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;Only for company. 
I knew I'd not be able to sleep for hours, and I wanted 
to put off the time when I'd be alone.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I wish I had as much influence with you as you 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0161" n="144"/>  
have with me,&rdquo; said Ursula, by way of preparation for 
confidences. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Influence?  Don't I do whatever you say?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She laughed. &ldquo;Nobody has influence over you,&rdquo; 
she said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not even myself,&rdquo; replied he morosely. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Well   &mdash;   that talking-to you gave me has had its 
effect,&rdquo; proceeded Mrs. Fitzhugh. &ldquo;It set me to 
thinking. There are other things besides love   &mdash;   man and 
woman love. I've decided to   &mdash;   to behave myself and give 
poor Clayton a chance to rest.&rdquo;  She smiled, a little 
maliciously. &ldquo;He's had a horrible fright. But it's 
over now. What a fine thing it is for a woman to have 
a sensible brother!&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman grunted, took another liberal draught of 
the champagne. 
</p><p>&ldquo;If I had a mind like yours!&rdquo; pursued Ursula. 
&ldquo;Now, you simply couldn't make a fool of yourself.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He looked at her sharply. He felt as if she had 
somehow got wind of his eccentric doings. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've always resented your rather contemptuous 
attitude toward women,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;But you are 
right   &mdash;   really you are. We're none of us worth the 
excitement men make about us.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It isn't the woman who makes a fool of the man,&rdquo; 
said Norman. &ldquo;It's the man who makes a fool of himself. 
A match can cause a terrific explosion if it's in the 
right place   &mdash;   but not if it isn't.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0162" n="145"/>  
</p><p>She nodded. &ldquo;That's it. We're simply matches   &mdash;    
and most of us of the poor sputtering kind that burns 
with a bad odor and goes out right away. A very 
inferior quality of matches.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; repeated Norman, &ldquo;it's the man who does 
the whole business.&rdquo; 
</p><p>A mocking smile curled her lips. &ldquo;I knew you 
weren't in love with Josephine.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He stared gloomily at his cigar. 
</p><p>&ldquo;But you're going to marry her?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm in love with her,&rdquo; he said angrily. &ldquo;And 
I'm going to marry her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She eyed him shrewdly. &ldquo;Fred   &mdash;   are you in love 
with some one else?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He did not answer immediately. When he did it was 
with a &ldquo;No&rdquo; that seemed the more emphatic for the 
delay. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, just one of your little affairs.&rdquo;  And she 
began to poke fun at him. &ldquo;I thought you had dropped 
that sort of thing for good and all. I hope Josie 
won't hear of it. She'd not understand. Women never 
do   &mdash;   unless they don't care a rap about the man. . . . 
Is she on the stage?  I know you'll not tell me, but 
I like to ask.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her brother looked at her rather wildly. &ldquo;Let's 
go home,&rdquo; he said. He was astounded and alarmed by 
the discovery that his infatuation had whirled him to 
the lunacy of longing to confide   &mdash;   and he feared lest, if 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0163" n="146"/>  
he should stay on, he would blurt out his disgraceful 
secret. &ldquo;Waiter, the bill.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't let's go yet,&rdquo; urged his sister. &ldquo;The most 
interesting people are beginning to come. Besides, I 
want more champagne.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He yielded. While she gazed round with the air 
of a visitor to a Zoo that is affected by fashionable 
people, and commented on the faces, figures, and clothes 
of the women, he stared at his plate and smoked and 
drank. Finally she said, &ldquo;I'd give anything to see you 
make a fool of yourself, just once.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He grinned. &ldquo;Things are in the way to having 
your wish gratified,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It looks to me as if 
my time had come.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She tried to conceal her anxiety. &ldquo;Are you 
serious?&rdquo; she asked. Then added:  &ldquo;Of course not. You 
simply couldn't. Especially now   &mdash;   when Josephine 
might hear. I suppose you've noticed how Joe Culver 
is hanging round her?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He nodded. 
</p><p>&ldquo;There's no danger   &mdash;   unless   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I shall marry Josephine.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not if she hears.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She's not going to hear.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't be too sure. Women love to boast. It 
tickles their vanity to have a man. Yes, they pretend 
to be madly in love simply to give themselves the excuse 
for tattling.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0164" n="147"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;She'll not hear.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You can't be sure.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I want you to help me out. I'm going to tell her 
I'm tremendously busy these few next days   &mdash;   or weeks.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Weeks!&rdquo; Ursula Fitzhugh laughed. &ldquo;My, it 
must be serious!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Weeks,&rdquo; repeated her brother. &ldquo;And I want you 
to say things that'll help out   &mdash;   and to see a good deal 
of her.&rdquo;  He flung down his cigar. &ldquo;You women don't 
understand how it is with a man.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't we though!  Why, it's a very ordinary 
occurrence for a woman to be really in love with several 
men at once.&rdquo; 
</p><p>His eyes gleamed jealously. &ldquo;I don't believe it,&rdquo; 
he cried. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not Josephine,&rdquo; she said reassuringly. &ldquo;She's 
one of those single-hearted, untemperamental women. 
They concentrate. They have no imagination.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn't thinking of Josephine,&rdquo; said he sullenly. 
&ldquo;To go back to what I was saying, I am in love with 
Josephine and with no one else. I can't explain to 
you how or why I'm entangled. But I'll get myself 
untangled all right   &mdash;   and very shortly.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I know that, Fred. You aren't the permanent-damn-fool sort.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; exclaimed he. &ldquo;It's a hopeful 
sign that I know exactly how big a fool I am.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She shook her head in strong dissent. &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0165" n="148"/>  
said she, &ldquo;it's a bad sign. I didn't realize 
I was making a fool of myself until you pointed it out 
to me. That stopped me. If I had been doing it with 
my eyes open, your jacking me up would only have 
made me go ahead.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;A woman's different. It doesn't take much to stop 
a woman. She's about half stopped when she begins.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Ursula was thoroughly alarmed. &ldquo;Fred,&rdquo; she said 
earnestly, &ldquo;you're running bang into danger. The 
time to stop is right now.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Can't do it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let's not talk about 
it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Can't?  That word from <hi rend="italic">you</hi>?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;From me,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;Don't forget helping out 
with Josephine. Let's go.&rdquo; 
</p><p>And he refused to be persuaded to stay on   &mdash;   or to 
be cajoled or baited into talking further of this secret 
his sister saw was weighing heavily. 
 
</p><p>He was down town half an hour earlier than usual 
the next morning. But no one noted it because his 
habit had always been to arrive among the first   &mdash;   not 
to set an example but to give his prodigious industry 
the fullest swing. There was in Turkey a great poet 
of whom it is said that he must have written twenty-five hours a day. Norman's accomplishment bulked in 
that same way before his associates. He had not slept 
the whole night. But, thanks to his enormous vitality, 
no trace of this serious dissipation showed. The huge 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0166" n="149"/>  
supper he had eaten   &mdash;   and drunk   &mdash;   the sleepless night 
and the giant breakfast of fruit and cereal and chops 
and wheat cakes and coffee he had laid in to stay him 
until lunch time, would together have given pause to 
any but such a physical organization as his. The only 
evidence of it was a certain slight irritability   &mdash;   but this 
may have been due to his state of intense self-dissatisfaction. 
</p><p>As he entered the main room his glance sought the 
corner where Miss Hallowell was ensconced. She 
happened to look up at that instant. With a radiant smile 
she bowed to him in friendliest fashion. He colored 
deeply, frowned with annoyance, bowed coldly and strode 
into his room. He fussed and fretted about with his 
papers for a few minutes, then rang the bell. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Send in Miss Pritchard   &mdash;   no, Mr. Gowdy   &mdash;   no, 
Miss Hallowell,&rdquo; he said to the office boy. And then he 
looked sharply at the pert young face for possible 
signs of secret cynical amusement. He saw none such, 
but was not convinced. He knew too well how by a 
sort of occult process the servants, all the subordinates, 
round a person like himself discover the most intimate 
secrets, almost get the news before anything has really 
occurred. 
</p><p>Miss Hallowell appeared, and very cold and reserved 
she looked as she stood waiting. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I sent for you because   &mdash;   &rdquo; he began. He glanced 
at the door to make sure that it was closed   &mdash;   '' because 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0167" n="150"/>  
I wanted to hear your voice.''  And he laughed 
boyishly. He was in high good humor now. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you speak to me as you did when you 
came in?&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>There was certainly novelty in this direct attack, 
this equal to equal criticism of his manners. He was 
not pleased with the novelty; but at the same time he 
felt a lack of the courage to answer her as she deserved, 
even if she was playing a clever game. &ldquo;It isn't necessary 
that the whole office should know our private business,&rdquo; 
said he. 
</p><p>She seemed astonished. &ldquo;What private business?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; said he, uncertain whether she was 
trifling with him or was really the innocent she pretended 
to be. &ldquo;If I were you, I'd not speak as friendlily 
as you did this morning   &mdash;   not before people.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; inquired she, her sweet young face still 
more perplexed. 
</p><p>&ldquo;This isn't a small town out West,&rdquo; explained he. 
&ldquo;It's New York. People misunderstand   &mdash;   or rather   &mdash;   &rdquo; 
He gave her a laughing, mischievous glance   &mdash;   &ldquo;or 
rather   &mdash;   they don't.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I can't see anything to make a mystery about,&rdquo; 
declared the girl. &ldquo;Why, you act as if there were 
something to be ashamed of in coming to see me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He was observing her sharply. How could a girl 
live in the New York atmosphere several years without 
getting a sensible point of view?  Yet, so far as he 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0168" n="151"/>  
could judge, this girl was perfectly honest in her 
ignorance. &ldquo;Don't be foolish,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Please accept the 
fact as I give it to you. You mustn't let people see 
everything.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She made no attempt to conceal her dislike for this. 
&ldquo;I won't be mixed up in anything like that,&rdquo; said she, 
quite gently and without a suggestion of pique or anger. 
&ldquo;It makes me feel low   &mdash;   and it's horribly common. 
Either we are going to be friends or we aren't. And 
if we are, why, we're friends whenever we meet. I'm 
not ashamed of you. And if you are ashamed of me, 
you can cut me out altogether.&rdquo; 
</p><p>His color deepened until his face was crimson. His 
eyes avoided hers. &ldquo;I was thinking chiefly of you,&rdquo; he 
said   &mdash;   and he honestly thought he was speaking the 
whole truth. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then please don't do so any more,&rdquo; said she, turning 
to go. &ldquo;I understand about New York snobbishness. 
I want nothing to do with it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He disregarded the danger of the door being opened 
at any moment. He rushed to her and took her reluctant 
hand. &ldquo;You mustn't blame me for the ways of 
the world. I can't change them. Do be sensible, 
dearest. You're only going to be here a few days longer. 
I've got that plan for you and your father all thought 
out. I'll put it through at once. I don't want the 
office talking scandal about us   &mdash;   do you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She looked at him pityingly. His eyes fell before 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0169" n="152"/>  
hers. &ldquo;I know it's a weakness,&rdquo; he said, giving up 
trying to deceive her and himself. &ldquo;But I can't help 
it. I was brought up that way.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Well   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">I</hi> wasn't. I see we can 
never be friends.&rdquo; 
</p><p>What a mess he had made of this affair!  This girl 
must be playing upon him. In his folly he had let her 
see how completely he was in her power, and she was 
using that power to establish relations between them 
that were the very opposite of what he desired   &mdash;   and 
must have. He must control himself. &ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; 
he said coldly, dropping her hand. &ldquo;I'm sorry, but 
unless you are reasonable I can do nothing for you.&rdquo; 
And he went to his desk. 
</p><p>She hesitated a moment; as her back was toward 
him, he could not see her expression. Without looking 
round she went out of his office. It took all his 
strength to let her go. &ldquo;She's bluffing,&rdquo; he muttered. 
&ldquo;And yet   &mdash;   perhaps she isn't. There may be people 
like that left in New York.&rdquo;  Whatever the truth, he 
simply must make a stand. He knew women; no woman 
had the least respect for a man who let her rule   &mdash;   and 
this woman, relying upon his weakness for her, was bent 
upon ruling. If he did not make a stand, she was lost 
to him. If he did make a stand, he could no more than 
lose her. Lose her!  That thought made him sick at 
heart. &ldquo;What a fool I am about her!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I 
must hurry things up. I must get enough of her   &mdash;    
must get through it and back to my sober senses.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0170" n="153"/>  
</p><p>That was a time of heavy pressure of important 
affairs. He furiously attacked one task after another, 
only to abandon each in turn. His mind, which had 
always been his obedient, very humble servant, absolutely 
refused to obey. He turned everything over to 
his associates or to subordinates, fighting all morning 
against the longing to send for her. At half past 
twelve he strode out of the office, putting on the air 
of the big man absorbed in big affairs. He descended 
to the street. But instead of going up town to keep 
an appointment at a business lunch he hung round the 
entrance to the opposite building. 
</p><p>She did not appear until one o'clock. Then out she 
came   &mdash;   with the head office boy!   &mdash;   the good-looking, 
young head office boy. 
</p><p>Norman's contempt for himself there reached its 
lowest ebb. For his blood boiled with jealousy   &mdash;    
jealousy of his head office boy!   &mdash;   and about an obscure little 
typewriter!  He followed the two, keeping to the other 
side of the street. Doubtless those who saw and 
recognized him fancied him deep in thought about some 
mighty problem of corporate law or policy, as he moved 
from and to some meeting with the great men who 
dictated to a nation of ninety millions what they should 
buy and how much they should pay for it. He saw the 
two enter a quick-lunch restaurant   &mdash;   struggled with a 
crack-brained impulse to join them   &mdash;   dragged himself 
away to his appointment. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0171" n="154"/>  
</p><p>He was never too amiable in dealing with his clients, 
because he had found that, in self-protection, to avoid 
being misunderstood and largely increasing the difficulties 
of amicable intercourse, he must keep the feel of 
iron very near the surface. That day he was for the 
first time irascible. If the business his clients were 
engaged in had been less perilous and his acute intelligence 
not indispensable, he would have cost the firm dear. But 
in business circles, where every consideration yields to 
that of material gain, the man with the brain may 
conduct himself as he pleases   &mdash;   and usually does so, 
when he has strength of character. 
</p><p>All afternoon he wrestled with himself to keep away 
from the office. He won, but it was the sort of victory 
that gives the winner the chagrin and despondency of 
defeat. At home, late in the afternoon, he found Josephine 
in the doorway, just leaving. &ldquo;You'll walk home 
with me   &mdash;   won't you?&rdquo; she said. And, taken unawares 
and intimidated by guilt, he could think of no excuse. 
</p><p>Some one   &mdash;   probably a Frenchman   &mdash;   has said that 
there are always in a man's life three women   &mdash;   the one 
on the way out, the one that is, and the one that is to 
be. Norman   &mdash;   ever the industrious trafficker with the 
feminine that the man of the intense vitality necessary 
to a great career of action is apt to be   &mdash;   was by no 
means new to the situation in which he now found 
himself. But never before had the circumstances been so 
difficult. Josephine in no way resembled any woman 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0172" n="155"/>  
with whom he had been involved; she was the first he 
had taken seriously. Nor did the other woman resemble 
the central figure in any of his affairs. He did not 
know what she was like, how to classify her; but he 
did know that she was unlike any woman he had ever 
known and that his feeling for her was different   &mdash;    
appallingly different   &mdash;   from any emotion any other woman 
had inspired in him. So   &mdash;   a walk alone with Josephine   &mdash;    
a first talk with her after his secret treachery   &mdash;    
was no light matter. &ldquo;Deeper and deeper,&rdquo; he said to 
himself. &ldquo;Where is this going to end?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She began by sympathizing with him for having so 
much to do   &mdash;   &ldquo;and father says you can get through 
more work than any man he ever knew, not excluding 
himself.&rdquo;  She was full of tenderness and compliment, 
of a kind of love that made him feel as the dirt beneath 
his feet. She respected him so highly; she believed 
in him so entirely. The thought of her discovering the 
truth, or any part of it, gave him a sensation of nausea. 
He was watching her out of the corner of his eye. Never 
had he seen her more statelily beautiful. If he should 
lose her!''  I'm mad   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">mad!</hi>'' he said 
to himself.  
</p><p>&ldquo;Josephine is as high above her as heaven above earth. 
What is there to her, anyhow?  Not brains   &mdash;   nor taste 
   &mdash;   nor such miraculous beauty. Why do I make an ass 
of myself about her?  I ought to go to my doctor.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't believe you're listening to what I'm saying,&rdquo; 
laughed Josephine. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0173" n="156"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;My head's in a terrible state,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;I 
can't think of anything.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't try to talk or to listen, dearest,&rdquo; said she 
in the sweet and soothing tone that is neither sweet nor 
soothing to a man in a certain species of unresponsive 
mood. &ldquo;This air will do you good. It doesn't annoy 
you for me to talk to you, does it?&rdquo; 
</p><p>The question was one of those which confidently 
expects, even demands, a sincere and strenuous negative 
for answer. It fretted him, this matter-of-course 
assumption of hers that she could not but be altogether 
pleasing, not to say enchanting to him. Her position, 
her wealth, the attentions she had received, the 
flatteries   &mdash;     In her circumstances could it be in human 
nature not to think extremely well of oneself?  And he 
admitted that she had the right so to think. Still   &mdash;    
For the first time she scraped upon his nerves. His 
reply, &ldquo;Annoy me?  The contrary,&rdquo; was distinctly 
crisp. To an experienced ear there would have sounded 
the faint warning under-note of sullenness. 
</p><p>But she, believing in his love and in herself, saw 
nothing, suspected nothing. &ldquo;We know each other so 
thoroughly,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;that we don't need to make 
any effort. How congenial we are!  I always understand 
you. I feel such a sense of the perfect freedom 
and perfect frankness between us. Don't you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You have wonderful intuitions,&rdquo; said he. 
</p><p>It was the time to alarm him by coldness, by capriciousness. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0174" n="157"/>  
But how could she know it?  And she was 
in love   &mdash;   really in love   &mdash;   not with herself, not with love, 
but with him. Thus, she made the mistake of all true 
lovers in those difficult moments. She let him see how 
absolutely she was his. Nor did the spectacle of her 
sincerity, of her belief in his sincerity put him in any 
better humor with himself. 
</p><p>The walk was a mere matter of a dozen blocks. He 
thought it would never end. &ldquo;You are sure you aren't 
ill?&rdquo; she said, when they were at her door   &mdash;   a superb 
bronze door it was, opening into a house of the splendor 
that for the acclimated New Yorker quite conceals and 
more than compensates absence of individual taste. 
&ldquo;You don't look ill. But you act queerly.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm often this way when they drive me too hard 
down town.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She looked at him with fond admiration; he might 
have been better pleased had there not been in the look 
a suggestion of the possessive. &ldquo;How they do need 
you!  Father says   &mdash;     But I mustn't make you any 
vainer than you are.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He usually loved compliment, could take it in its 
rawest form with fine human gusto. Now, he did not 
care enough about that &ldquo;father says&rdquo; to rise to her 
obvious bait. &ldquo;I'm horribly tired,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Shall 
I see you to-morrow?  No, I guess not   &mdash;   not for several 
days. You understand?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; replied she. &ldquo;I'll miss you dreadfully, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0175" n="158"/>  
but my father has trained me well. I know I mustn't 
be selfish   &mdash;   and tempt you to neglect things.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I must be off.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You'll come in   &mdash;   just a moment?&rdquo;  Her eyes 
sparkled. &ldquo;The butler will have sense enough to go 
straight away   &mdash;   and the small reception room will be 
quite empty as usual.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He could not escape. A few seconds and he was 
alone with her in the little room   &mdash;   how often had he   &mdash;    
they   &mdash;   been glad of its quiet and seclusion on such 
occasions!  She laid her hand upon his shoulders, gazed 
at him proudly. &ldquo;It was here,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that you 
first kissed me. Do you remember?&rdquo; 
</p><p>To take her gaze from his face and to avoid seeing 
her look of loving trust, he put his arms round her. 
&ldquo;I don't deserve you,&rdquo; he said   &mdash;   one of those empty 
pretenses of confession that yet give the human soul a 
sense of truthfulness. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You'd not say that if you knew how happy you 
make me,&rdquo; murmured she. 
</p><p>The welcome sound of a step in the hall give him 
his release. When he was in the street, he wiped his hot 
face with his handkerchief. &ldquo;And I thought I had no 
moral sense left!&rdquo; he reflected   &mdash;   not the first man, in 
this climax day of the triumph of selfish philosophies, 
to be astonished by the discovery that the dead hands 
of heredity and tradition have a power that can 
successfully defy reason. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0176" n="159"/>  
</p><p>He started to walk back home, on impulse took a 
passing taxi and went to his club. It was the Federal. 
They said of it that no man who amounted to anything 
in New York could be elected a member, because any 
man on his way up could not but offend one or more of 
the important persons in control. Most of its members 
were nominated at birth or in childhood and elected as 
soon as they were twenty-one. Norman was elected 
after he became a man of consequence. He regarded it 
as one of the signal triumphs of his career; and beyond 
question it was proof of his power, of the eagerness of 
important men, despite their jealousy, to please him and 
to be in a position to get the benefit of his brains should 
need arise. Norman's whole career, like every career 
great and small, in the arena of action, was a derision 
of the ancient moralities, a demonstration of the value 
of fear as an aid to success. Even his friends   &mdash;   and he 
had as many as he cared to have   &mdash;   had been drawn to 
him by the desire to placate him, to stand well where 
there was danger in standing ill. 
</p><p>Until dinner time he stood at the club bar, drinking 
one cocktail after another with that supreme 
indifference to consequences to health which made his 
fellow men gape and wonder   &mdash;   and cost an occasional 
imitator health, and perhaps life. Nor did the powerful 
liquor have the least effect upon him, apparently. Possibly 
he was in a better humor, but not noticeably so. 
He dined at the club and spent the evening at bridge, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0177" n="160"/>  
winning several hundred dollars. He enjoyed the 
consideration he received at that club, for his fellow 
members being men of both social and financial consequence, 
their conspicuous respect for him was a concentrated 
essence of general adulation. He lingered on, eating 
a great supper with real appetite. He went home in 
high good humor with himself. He felt that he was a 
conqueror born, that such things of his desire as did 
not come could be forced to come. He no longer 
regarded his passion for the nebulous girl of many 
personalities as a descent from dignity. Was he not king? 
Did not his favor give her whatever rank he pleased? 
Might not a king pick and choose, according to his 
fancy?  Let the smaller fry grow nervous about these 
matters of caste. They did well to take care lest they 
should fall. But not he!  He had won thus far by 
haughtiness, never by cringing. His mortal day would 
be that in which he should abandon his natural tactics 
for the modes of lesser men. True, only a strong head 
could remain steady in these giddy altitudes of self-confidence. But was not his head strong? 
</p><p>And without hesitation he called up the vision that 
made him delirious-and detained it and reveled in it 
until sleep came.</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0178" n="161"/>   
<head>VIII</head> 
<p>THE longer he thought of it the stronger grew his 
doubt that the little Hallowell girl could be so indifferent 
to him as she seemed. Not that she was a fraud   &mdash;    
that is, a conscious fraud   &mdash;   even so much of a fraud as 
the sincerest of the other women he had known. Simply 
that she was carrying out a scheme of coquetry. Could 
it be in human nature, even in the nature of the most 
indiscriminating of the specimens of young feminine 
ignorance and folly, not to be flattered by the favor of 
such a man as he? Common sense answered that it could 
not be   &mdash;   but neglected to point out to him that almost 
any vagary might be expected of human nature, when it 
could produce such a deviation from the recognized 
types as a man of his position agitated about such an 
unsought obscurity as Miss Hallowell. He continued 
to debate the state of her mind as if it were an affair 
of mightiest moment   &mdash;   which, indeed, it was to him. And 
presently his doubt strengthened into conviction. She 
must be secretly pleased, flattered, responsive. She had 
been in the office long enough to be impressed by his 
position. Yes, there must be more or less pretense in her 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0179" n="162"/>  
apparently complete indifference   &mdash;   more or less pretense, 
more or less coquetry, probably not a little timidity. 
</p><p>She would come down from her high horse   &mdash;   with 
help and encouragement from him. He was impatient to 
get to the office and see just how she would do it   &mdash;    
what absurd, amusing attractive child's trick she would 
think out, imagining she could fool him, as lesser 
intelligences are ever fatuously imagining they can outwit 
greater. 
</p><p>He rather thought she would come in to see him on 
some pretext, would maneuver round like a bird 
pretending to flutter away from the trap it has every 
intention of entering. But eleven o'clock of a wasted 
morning came and she did not appear. He went out to see if 
she was there   &mdash;   she must be sick; she could not be there 
or he would have heard from her. . . . Yes, she was at 
her desk, exactly as always. No, not exactly the same. 
She was obviously attractive now; the air of insignificance 
had gone, and not the dullest eyes in that office 
could fail to see at least something of her beauty. 
And Tetlow was hanging over her, while the girls and 
boys grinned and whispered. Clearly, the office was 
&ldquo;on to&rdquo; Tetlow. . . . Norman, erect and coldly 
infuriate, called out: 
</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Tetlow   &mdash;   one moment, please.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He went back to his den, Tetlow startling and 
following like one on the way to the bar for sentence. 
&ldquo;Mr. Tetlow,&rdquo; he said, when they were shut in together, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0180" n="163"/>  
&ldquo;you are making a fool of yourself before the 
whole office.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Be a little patient with me, Mr. Norman,&rdquo; said the 
head clerk humbly. &ldquo;I've got another place for her. 
She's going to take it to-morrow. Then   &mdash;   there'll be 
no more trouble.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman paled. &ldquo;She wishes to leave?&rdquo; he 
contrived to articulate. 
</p><p>&ldquo;She spoke to me about leaving before I told her 
I had found her another job.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman debated   &mdash;   but for only a moment. &ldquo;I do 
not wish her to leave,&rdquo; he said coldly. &ldquo;I find her 
useful and most trustworthy.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow's eyes were fixed strangely upon him. 
</p><p>&ldquo;What's the matter with you?&rdquo; asked Norman, the 
under-note of danger but thinly covered. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then she was right,&rdquo; said Tetlow slowly. &ldquo;I 
thought she was mistaken. I see that she is right.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Norman   &mdash;   a mere 
inquiry, devoid of bluster or any other form of 
nervousness. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You know very well what I mean, Fred Norman,&rdquo; 
said Tetlow. &ldquo;And you ought to be ashamed of yourself.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't stand there scowling and grimacing like 
an idiot,&rdquo; said Norman with an amused smile. &ldquo;What 
do you mean?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She told me   &mdash;   about your coming to see her   &mdash;    
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0181" n="164"/>  
about your offer to do something for her father   &mdash;   about 
your acting in a way that made her uneasy.&rdquo; 
</p><p>For an instant Norman was panic-stricken. Then 
his estimate of her reassured him. &ldquo;I took your 
advice,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I went to see for myself. How did 
I act that she was made uneasy?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She didn't say. But a woman can tell what a man 
has in the back of his head   &mdash;   when it concerns her. And 
she is a good woman   &mdash;   so innocent that you ought to be 
ashamed of yourself for even thinking of her in that 
way. God has given innocence instincts, and she felt 
what you were about.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman laughed   &mdash;   a deliberate provocation. &ldquo;Love 
has made a fool of you, old man,&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I notice you don't deny,&rdquo; retorted Tetlow 
shrewdly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Deny what?  There's nothing to deny.&rdquo;  He felt 
secure now that he knew she had been reticent with 
Tetlow as to the happenings in the cottage. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe I'm wronging you,&rdquo; said Tetlow, but not 
in the tone of belief. &ldquo;However that may be, I know 
you'll not refuse to listen to my appeal. I love her, 
Norman. I'm going to make her my wife if I can. 
And I ask you   &mdash;   for the sake of our old friendship   &mdash;    
to let her alone. I've no doubt you could dazzle her. 
You couldn't make a bad woman of her. But you 
could make her very miserable.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman pushed about the papers before him. His 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0182" n="165"/>  
face wore a cynical smile; but Tetlow, who knew him 
in all his moods, saw that he was deeply agitated. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't know that I can win her, Fred,&rdquo; he pleaded. 
&ldquo;But I feel that I might if I had a fair chance.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You think she'd refuse <hi rend="italic">you</hi>?&rdquo; 
said Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Like a flash, unless I'd made her care for me. 
That's the kind she is.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds absurd. Why, there isn't a woman 
in New York who would refuse a chance to take a high 
jump up.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'd have said so, too. But since I've gotten 
acquainted with her I've learned better. She may be 
spoiled some day, but she hasn't been yet. God knows, 
I wish I could tempt her. But I can't.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You're entirely too credulous, old man. She'll 
make a fool of you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I know better,&rdquo; Tetlow stubbornly maintained. 
&ldquo;Anyhow, I don't care. I love her, and I'd marry her, 
no matter what her reason for marrying me was.&rdquo; 
</p><p>What pitiful infatuation!   &mdash;   worse than his own. 
Poor Tetlow!   &mdash;   he deserved a better fate than to be 
drawn into this girl's trap   &mdash;   for, of course, she never 
could care for such a heavy citizen   &mdash;   heavy and homely 
   &mdash;   the loosely fat kind of homely that is admired by no 
one, not even by a woman with no eye at all for the 
physical points of the male. It would be a real kindness 
to save worthy Tetlow. What a fool she'd make 
of him!   &mdash;   how she'd squander his money   &mdash;   and torment 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0183" n="166"/>  
him with jealousy   &mdash;   and unfit him for his career. Poor 
Tetlow!  If he could get what he wanted, he'd be well 
punished for his imprudence in wanting it. Really, 
could friendship do him a greater service than to save 
him? 
</p><p>Norman gave Tetlow a friendly, humorous glance. 
&ldquo;You're a hopeless case, Billy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But at 
least don't rush into trouble. Take your time. You 
can always get in, you know; and you may not get 
in quite so deep.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You promise to let her alone?&rdquo; said Tetlow 
eagerly. 
</p><p>Again his distinguished friend laughed. &ldquo;Don't 
be an ass, old man. Why imagine that, just because 
you've taken a fancy to a girl, everyone wants her?&rdquo; 
He clapped him on the shoulder, gave him a push 
toward the door. &ldquo;I've wasted enough time on this 
nonsense.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow did not venture to disregard a hint so plain. 
He went with his doubt still unsolved   &mdash;   his doubt whether 
his jealousy was right or his high opinion of his 
hero friend whose series of ever-mounting successes had 
filled him with adoration. He knew the way of success, 
knew no man could tread it unless he had, or acquired, 
a certain hardness of heart that made him an uncomfortable 
not to say dangerous associate. He regretted 
his own inability to acquire that indispensable hardness, 
and envied and admired it in Fred Norman. But, at 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0184" n="167"/>  
the same time that he admired, he could not help distrusting. 
</p><p>Norman battled with his insanity an hour, then sent 
for Miss Hallowell. 
</p><p>The girl had lost her look of strength and vitality. 
She seemed frail and dim   &mdash;   so unimportant physically 
that he wondered why her charm for him persisted. 
Yet it did persist. If he could take her in his arms, 
could make her drooping beauty revive!   &mdash;   through love 
for him if possible; if not, then through anger and 
hate!  He must make her feel, must make her acknowledge, 
that he had power. It seemed to him another 
instance of the resistless fascination which the 
unattainable, however unworthy, has ever had for the 
conqueror temperament. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You are leaving?&rdquo; he said curtly, both a question 
and an affirmation. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You are making a mistake   &mdash;   a serious mistake.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She stood before him listlessly, as if she had no 
interest either in what he was saying or in him. That 
maddening indifference! 
</p><p>&ldquo;It was a mistake to tattle your trouble to Tetlow.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I did not tattle,&rdquo; said she quietly, colorlessly. 
&ldquo;I 
said only enough to make him help me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And what did he say about me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That I had misjudged you   &mdash;   that I must be mistaken.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0185" n="168"/>  
</p><p>Norman laughed. &ldquo;How seriously the little people 
of the world do take themselves!&rdquo; 
</p><p>She looked at him. His amused eyes met hers 
frankly. &ldquo;You didn't mean it?&rdquo; she said. 
</p><p>He beamed on her. &ldquo;Certainly I did. But I'm 
not a lunatic or a wild beast. Do you think I would 
take advantage of a girl in your position?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her eyes seemed to grow large and weary, and an 
expression of experience stole over her young face, 
giving it a strange appearance of age-in-youth. &ldquo;It has 
been done,&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>How reconcile such a look with the theory of her 
childlike innocence?  But then how reconcile any two 
of the many varied personalities he had seen in her? 
He said:  &ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   it has been done. But not by me. 
I shall take from you only what you gladly give.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You will get nothing else,&rdquo; said she with quiet 
strength. 
</p><p>&ldquo;That being settled   &mdash;   &rdquo; he went on, holding up a 
small package of papers bound together by an elastic   &mdash;    
&ldquo;Here are the proposed articles of incorporation of 
the Chemical Research Company. How do you like 
the name?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;The company that is to back your father. Capital 
stock, twenty-five thousand dollars, one half paid 
up. Your father to be employed as director of the 
laboratories at five thousand a year, with a fund of 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0186" n="169"/>  
ten thousand to draw upon. You to be employed as 
secretary and treasurer at fifteen hundred a year. I 
will take the paid-up stock, and your father and you 
will have the privilege of buying it back at par within 
five years. Do you follow me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I think I understand,&rdquo; was her unexpected reply. 
Her replies were usually unexpected, like the expressions 
of her face and figure; she was continually 
comprehending where one would have said she would not, 
and not comprehending where it seemed absurd that 
she should not. &ldquo;Yes, I understand. . . . What else?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing else.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She looked intently at him, and her eyes seemed to 
be reading his soul to the bottom. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing else,&rdquo; he repeated. 
</p><p>&ldquo;No obligation   &mdash;   for money   &mdash;   or   &mdash;   for anything?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No obligation. A hope perhaps.&rdquo;  He was smiling 
with the gayest good humor. &ldquo;But not the kind 
of hope that ever becomes a disagreeable demand for 
payment.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She seated herself, her hands in her lap, her eyes 
down   &mdash;   a lovely picture of pensive repose. He waited 
patiently, feasting his senses upon her delicate, 
aromatic loveliness. At last she said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;I accept.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He had anticipated an argument. This promptness 
took him by surprise. He felt called upon to explain, 
to excuse her acceptance. &ldquo;I am taking a little flyer 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0187" n="170"/>  
   &mdash;   making a gamble,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Your father may turn 
up nothing of commercial value. Again the company 
may pay big   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>She gave him a long look through half-closed eyes, 
a queer smile flitting round her lips. &ldquo;I understand 
perfectly why you are doing it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you 
understand why I am accepting?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why should you refuse?&rdquo; rejoined he. &ldquo;It is a 
good business prop   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You know very well why I should refuse. But   &mdash;   &rdquo; 
She gave a quiet laugh of experience; it made him feel 
that she was making a fool of him   &mdash;   &ldquo;I shall not refuse. 
I am able to take care of myself. And I want father 
to have his chance. Of course, I shan't explain to him.&rdquo; 
She gave him a mischievous glance. &ldquo;And I don't think 
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> will.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He contrived to cover his anger, doubt, chagrin, 
general feeling of having been outwitted. &ldquo;No, I shan't 
tell him,&rdquo; laughed he. &ldquo;You are making a great fool 
of me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to back out?&rdquo; 
</p><p>What audacity!  He hesitated   &mdash;   did not dare. Her 
indifference to him   &mdash;   her personal, her physical indifference 
gave her the mastery. His teeth clenched and his 
passion blazed in his eyes as he said:  &ldquo;No   &mdash;   you witch! 
I'll see it through.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She smiled lightly. &ldquo;I suppose you'll come to the 
offices of the company   &mdash;   occasionally?&rdquo;  She drew 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0188" n="171"/>  
nearer, stood at the corner of the desk. Into her 
exquisite eyes came a look of tenderness. &ldquo;And I shall 
be glad to see you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You mean that?&rdquo; he said, despising himself for 
his humble eagerness, and hating her even as he loved 
her. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Indeed I do.&rdquo;  She smiled bewitchingly. &ldquo;You 
are a lot better man than you think.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I am an awful fool about you,&rdquo; retorted he. &ldquo;You 
see, I play my game with all my cards on the table. I 
wish I could say the same of you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I am not playing a game,&rdquo; replied she. &ldquo;You 
make a mystery where there isn't any. And   &mdash;   all your 
cards aren't on the table.&rdquo;  She laughed mockingly. 
&ldquo;At least, you think there's one that isn't   &mdash;   though, 
really, it is.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;About your engagement.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He covered superbly. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he in the most 
indifferent tone. &ldquo;Tetlow told you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;As soon as I heard that,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I felt 
better about you. I understand how it is with men   &mdash;    
the passing fancies they have for women.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;How did you learn?&rdquo; demanded he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think a girl could spend several years 
knocking about down town in New York without getting 
experience?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He smiled   &mdash;   a forced smile of raillery, hiding sudden 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0189" n="172"/>  
fierce suspicion and jealousy. &ldquo;I should say not. 
But you always pretend innocence.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I can't be held responsible for what you read into 
my looks and into what I say,&rdquo; observed she with her 
air of a wise old infant. &ldquo;But I was so glad to find 
out that you were seriously in love with a nice girl up 
town.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He burst out laughing. She gazed at him in childlike 
surprise. &ldquo;Why are you laughing at me?&rdquo; she 
asked. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing   &mdash;   nothing,&rdquo; he assured her. He would 
have found it difficult to explain why he was so intensely 
amused at hearing the grand Josephine Burroughs 
called &ldquo;a nice girl up town.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You are in love with her?  You are engaged to 
her?&rdquo; she inquired, her grave eyes upon him with an 
irresistible appeal for truth in them. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Tetlow didn't lie to you,&rdquo; evaded he. &ldquo;You don't 
know it, but Tetlow is going to ask you to marry him.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I knew,&rdquo; replied she indifferently. 
</p><p>&ldquo;How?  Did he tell you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No. Just as I knew you were not going to ask 
me to marry you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The mere phrase, even when stated as a negation, 
gave him a sensation of ice suddenly laid against the 
heart. 
</p><p>&ldquo;It's quite easy to tell the difference between the 
two kinds of men   &mdash;   those that care for me more than 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0190" n="173"/>  
they care for themselves and those that care for 
themselves more than they care for me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's the way it looks to you   &mdash;   is it?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's the way it is,&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;There are some things you don't understand. This 
is one of them.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe I don't,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;But I've my own 
idea   &mdash;   and I'm going to stick to it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>This amused him. &ldquo;You are a very opinionated 
and self-confident young lady,&rdquo; said he. 
</p><p>She laughed roguishly. &ldquo;I'm taking up a lot of 
your time.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't think of it. You haven't asked when the 
new deal is to begin.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes   &mdash;   and I shall have to tell Mr. Tetlow I'm 
not taking the place he got for me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Be careful what you say to him,&rdquo; cautioned 
Norman. &ldquo;You must see it wouldn't be well to tell him 
what you are going to do. There's no reason on earth 
why he should know your business   &mdash;   is there?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She did not reply; she was reflecting. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You are not thinking of marrying Tetlow   &mdash;   are 
you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don't love him   &mdash;   and couldn't 
learn to.&rdquo; 
</p><p>With a sincerely judicial air, now that he felt 
secure, he said:  &ldquo;Why not?  It would be a good match.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't love him,&rdquo; she repeated, as if that were a 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0191" n="174"/>  
sufficient and complete answer. And he was astonished 
to find that he so regarded it, also, in spite of every 
assault of all that his training had taught him to regard 
as common sense about human nature. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You can simply say to Tetlow that you've decided 
to stay at home and take care of your father. The 
offices of the company will be at your house. Your 
official duties practically amount to taking care of your 
father. So you'll be speaking the truth.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn't exactly lying, to keep something from 
somebody who has no right to know it. What you suggest 
isn't quite the truth. But it's near enough, and 
I'll say it to him.&rdquo; 
</p><p>His own view of lying was the same as that she 
had expressed. Also, he had no squeamishness about 
saying what was in no sense true, if the falsehood were 
necessary to his purposes. Yet her statement of her 
code, moral though he thought it and eminently sensible 
as well, lowered her once more in his estimation. He 
was eager to find reason or plausible excuse for believing 
her morally other and less than she seemed to be. 
Immediately the prospects of his ultimate projects   &mdash;    
whatever they might prove to be   &mdash;   took on a more hopeful 
air. &ldquo;And I'd advise you to have Tetlow keep away 
from you. We don't want him nosing round.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He is a nice man, but 
tiresome. And if I encouraged him ever so little, he'd 
be sentimental. The most tiresome thing in the world 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0192" n="175"/>  
to a girl is a man who talks that sort of thing when 
she doesn't want to hear it   &mdash;   from him.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He laughed. &ldquo;Meaning me?&rdquo; he suggested. 
</p><p>She nodded, much pleased. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she replied. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't worry about that,&rdquo; mocked he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I shan't till I have to,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;And 
I don't think I'll have to.&rdquo; 
 
</p><p>On the Monday morning following, Tetlow came in 
to see Norman as soon as he arrived. &ldquo;I want a two 
weeks' leave,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm going to Bermuda or down 
there somewhere.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why, what's the matter?&rdquo; cried Norman. &ldquo;You 
do look ill, old man.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I saw her last night,&rdquo; replied the chief clerk, 
dropping an effort at concealing his dejection. &ldquo;She 
   &mdash;   she turned me down.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Really?  You?&rdquo; Norman's tone of sympathetic 
surprise would not have deceived half attentive ears. 
But Tetlow was securely absorbed. &ldquo;Why, Billy, she 
can't hope to make as good a match.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's what I told her   &mdash;   when I saw the game was 
going against me. But it was no use.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman trifled nervously with the papers before 
him. Presently he said, &ldquo;Is it some one else?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow shook his head. 
</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Because she said so,&rdquo; replied the head clerk. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0193" n="176"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh   &mdash;   if she said so, that settles it,&rdquo; said Norman 
with raillery. 
</p><p>&ldquo;She's given up work   &mdash;   thank God,&rdquo; pursued Tetlow. 
&ldquo;She's getting more beautiful all the time   &mdash;    
Norman, if you had seen her last night, you'd understand 
why I'm stark mad about her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman's eyes were down. His hands, the muscles 
of his jaw were clinched. 
</p><p>&ldquo;But, I mustn't think of that,&rdquo; Tetlow went on. 
&ldquo;As I was about to say, if she were to stay on in the 
offices some one   &mdash;   some attractive man like you, only 
with the heart of a scoundrel   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman laughed cynically. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, a scoundrel!&rdquo; reiterated the fat head-clerk. 
&ldquo;Some scoundrel would tempt her beyond her power to 
resist. Money and clothes and luxury will do anything. 
We all get to be harlots here in New York. Some of 
us know it, and some don't. But we all look it and 
act it. And she'd go the way of the rest   &mdash;   with or 
without marriage. It's just as well she didn't marry 
me. I know what'd have become of her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman nodded. 
</p><p>Tetlow gave a weary sigh. &ldquo;Anyhow, she's safe at 
home with her father. He's found a backer for his 
experiments.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's good,&rdquo; said Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You can spare me for ten days,&rdquo; Tetlow went 
on. &ldquo;I'd be of no use if I stayed.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0194" n="177"/>  
</p><p>There was a depth of misery in his kind gray eyes 
that moved Norman to get up and lay a friendly hand 
on his shoulder. &ldquo;It's the best thing, old man. She 
wasn't for you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow dropped into a chair and sobbed. &ldquo;It has 
killed me,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;I don't mean I'll commit 
suicide or die. I mean I'm dead inside   &mdash;   dead.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, come, Billy   &mdash;   where's your good sense?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I know what I'm talking about,&rdquo; said he. 
&ldquo;Norman, God help the man who meets the woman he really 
wants   &mdash;   God help him if she doesn't want him. You 
don't understand. You'll never have the experience. 
Any woman you wanted would be sure to want you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman, his hand still on Tetlow's shoulder, was 
staring ahead with a terrible expression upon his strong 
features. 
</p><p>&ldquo;If she could see the inside of me   &mdash;   the part that's 
the real me   &mdash;   I think she would love me   &mdash;   or learn to 
love me. But she can only see the outside   &mdash;   this homely 
face and body of mine. It's horrible, Fred   &mdash;   to have 
a mind and a heart fit for love and for being loved, 
and an outside that repels it. And how many of us 
poor devils of that sort there are   &mdash;   men and women 
both!&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman was at the window now, his back to the 
room, to his friend. After a while Tetlow rose and 
made a feeble effort to straighten himself. &ldquo;Is it all 
right about the vacation?&rdquo; he asked. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0195" n="178"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Norman, without turning. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Fred. You're a good friend.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'll see you before you go,&rdquo; said Norman, still 
facing the window. &ldquo;You'll come back all right.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow did not answer. When Norman turned he 
was alone.</p>

<p>IN no way was Norman's luck superior to most 
men's more splendidly than in that his inborn tendency 
to arrogant and extravagant desires was matched by an 
inborn capacity to get the necessary money. His 
luxurious tastes were certainly not moderated by his 
associations   &mdash;   enormously rich people who, while they 
could be stingy enough in some respects, at the same 
time could and did fling away fortunes in gratifying 
selfish whims   &mdash;   for silly showy houses, for retinues of 
wasteful servants, for gewgaws that accentuated the 
homeliness of their homely women and coarsened and 
vulgarized their pretty women   &mdash;   or perhaps for a 
night's gambling or entertaining, or for the forced 
smiles and contemptuous caresses of some belle of the 
other world. Norman fortunately cared not at all for 
the hugely expensive pomp of the life of the rich; if he 
had, he would have hopelessly involved himself, as after 
all he was not a money-grubber but a lawyer. But when 
there appeared anything for which he did care, he was 
ready to bid for it like the richest of the rich. 
</p><p>Therefore the investment of a few thousand dollars 
seemed a small matter to him. He had many a time 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0199" n="180"/>  
tossed away far more for far less. He did not dole 
out the sum he had agreed to provide. He paid it 
into the Jersey City bank to the credit of the Chemical 
Research Company and informed its secretary and treasurer 
that she could draw freely against it. &ldquo;If you 
will read the by-laws of the company,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you 
will see that you've the right to spend exactly as you 
see fit. When the money runs low, let me know.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'll be very careful,&rdquo; said Dorothea Hallowell, 
secretary and treasurer. 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's precisely what we don't want,&rdquo; replied he. 
He glanced round the tiny parlor of the cottage. &ldquo;We 
want everything to be run in first-class shape. That's 
the only way to get results. First of all, you must 
take a proper house   &mdash;   a good-sized one, with large 
grounds   &mdash;   room for building your father a proper 
laboratory.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her dazed and dazzled expression delighted him. 
</p><p>&ldquo;And you must live better. You must keep at 
least two servants.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But we can't afford it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Your father has five thousand a year. You have 
fifteen hundred. That makes sixty-five hundred. The 
rent of the house and the wages and keep of the servants 
are a charge against the corporation. So, you can well 
afford to make yourselves comfortable.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I haven't got used to the idea as yet,&rdquo; said 
Dorothea. &ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> better off 
than we were.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0200" n="181"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;And you must live better. I want you to get 
some clothes   &mdash;   and things of that sort.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She shrank within herself and sat quiet, her gaze 
fixed upon her hands lying limp in her lap. 
</p><p>&ldquo;There is no reason why your father shouldn't be 
made absolutely comfortable and happy. That's the 
way to get the best results from a man of his sort.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She faded on toward the self-effacing blank he had 
first known. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Think it out, Dorothy,&rdquo; he said in his frankest, 
kindliest way. &ldquo;You'll see I'm right.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;No?  What does that mean?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've an instinct against it,&rdquo; replied she. &ldquo;I'd 
rather father and I kept on as we are.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But that's impossible. You've no right to live in 
this small, cramping way. You must broaden out and 
give <hi rend="italic">him</hi> room to grow. . . . Isn't 
that sensible? &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It sounds so,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;But   &mdash;   &rdquo;  She gazed 
round helplessly   &mdash;   &ldquo;I'm afraid!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Afraid of what?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then don't bother about it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'll have to be very   &mdash;   careful,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully. 
</p><p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;Only, don't live and 
think on a ten-dollar-a-week basis. That isn't the way 
to get on.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0201" n="182"/>  
</p><p>He never again brought up the matter in direct 
form. But most of his conversation was indirect and 
more or less subtle suggestions as to ways of branching 
out. She moved cautiously for a few days, then timidly 
began to spend money. 
</p><p>There is a notion widely spread abroad that people 
who have little money know more about the art of spending 
money and the science of economizing than those 
who have much. It would be about as sensible to say 
that the best swimmers are those who have never been 
near the water, or no nearer than a bath tub. Anyone 
wishing to be convinced need only make an excursion 
into the poor tenement district and observe the garbage 
barrels overflowing with spoiled food   &mdash;   or the trashy 
goods exposed for sale in the shops and the markets. 
Those who have had money and have lost it are probably, 
as a rule, the wisest in thrift. Those who have 
never had money are almost invariably prodigal   &mdash;    
because they are ignorant. When Dorothea Hallowell was 
a baby the family had had money. But never since she 
could remember had they been anything but poor. 
</p><p>She did not know how to spend money. She did 
not know prices or values   &mdash;   being in that respect 
precisely like the mass of mankind   &mdash;   and womankind   &mdash;   who 
imagine they are economical because they hunt so-called 
bargains and haggle with merchants who have got 
doubly ready for them by laying in inferior goods and 
by putting up prices in advance. She knew how much 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0202" n="183"/>  
ten dollars a week was, the meaning of the twenty to 
thirty dollars a week her father had made. But she 
had only a faint   &mdash;   and exaggeratedly mistaken   &mdash;   notion 
about sixty-five hundred a year   &mdash;   six and a half 
thousands. It seemed wealth to her, so vast that a hundred 
thousand a year would have seemed no more. As soon 
as she drifted away from the known course   &mdash;   the thirty 
to forty dollars a week upon which they had been living 
   &mdash;   Dorothea Hallowell was in a trackless sea, with a 
broken compass and no chart whatever. A common 
enough experience in America, the land of sudden 
changes of fortune, of rosiest hopes about &ldquo;striking it 
rich,&rdquo; of carelessness and ignorance as to values, of 
eager and untrained appetite for luxury and novelty 
of any and every kind. 
</p><p>At first any expenditure, however small, for the 
plainest comfort which had been beyond their means seemed 
a giddy extravagance. But a bank account   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">and</hi> a 
check book   &mdash;   soon dissipated that nervousness. A few 
charge accounts, a little practice in the simple easy 
gesture of drawing a check, and she was almost at her 
ease. With people who have known only squalor or 
with those who have earned their better fortune by 
privation and slow accumulation, the spreading out 
process is usually slow   &mdash;   not so slow as it used to be when 
our merchants had not learned the art of tempting any 
and every kind of human nature, but still far from 
rapid. A piece of money reminds them vividly and 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0203" n="184"/>  
painfully of the toil put into acquiring it; and they shy 
away from the pitfall of the facile check. With those 
born and bred as Dorothy was and elevated into what 
seems to them affluence by no effort of their own, the 
spreading is a tropical, overnight affair. 
</p><p>Counting all she spent and arranged to spend in 
those first few weeks, you had no great total. But it 
was great for a girl who had been making ten dollars a 
week. Also there were sown in her mind broadcast and 
thick the seeds of desire for more luxurious comfort, of 
need for it, that could never be uprooted. 
</p><p>Norman came over almost every evening. He got 
a new and youthful and youth-restoring kind of pleasure 
out of this process of expansion. He liked to hear 
each trifling detail, and he was always making suggestions 
that bore immediate fruit in further expenditure. 
When he again brought up the subject of a larger 
house, she listened with only the faintest protests. Her 
ideas of such a short time before seemed small, laughably 
small now. &ldquo;Father was worrying only this morning 
because he is so cramped,&rdquo; she admitted. 
</p><p>&ldquo;We must remedy that at once,&rdquo; said Norman. 
</p><p>And on the following Sunday he and she went house 
hunting. They found a satisfactory place   &mdash;   peculiarly 
satisfactory to Norman because it was near the Hudson 
tunnel, and so only a few minutes from his office. To 
Dorothy it loomed a mansion, almost a palace. In fact 
it was a modestly roomy old-fashioned brick house, with 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0204" n="185"/>  
a brick stable at the side that, with a little changing, 
would make an admirable laboratory. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You haven't the time   &mdash;   or the experience   &mdash;   to fit 
this place up,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;I'll attend to it   &mdash;   that 
is, I'll have it attended to.&rdquo;  Seeing her uneasy expression, 
he added:  &ldquo;I can get much better terms. They'd 
certainly overcharge you. There's no sense in wasting 
money   &mdash;   is there?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she admitted, convinced. 
</p><p>He gave the order to a firm of decorators. It was 
a moderate order, considering the amount of work that 
had to be done. But if the girl had seen the estimates 
Norman indorsed, she would have been terrified. However, 
he saw to it that she did not see them; and she, 
ignorant of values, believed him when he told her the 
general account of the corporation must be charged with 
two thousand dollars. 
</p><p>Her alarm took him by surprise. The sum seemed 
small to him   &mdash;   and it was only about one fifth what 
the alterations and improvements had cost. Cried she, 
&ldquo;Why, that's more than our whole income for a year 
has been!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You are forgetting these improvements add to the 
value of the property. I've bought it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>That quieted her. &ldquo;You are sure you didn't pay 
those decorators and furnishers too much?&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You don't like their work?&rdquo; inquired he, chagrined. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0205" n="186"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes   &mdash;   yes, indeed,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;I like 
plain, solid-looking things. But   &mdash;   two thousand dollars 
is a lot of money.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman regretted that, as his whole object had 
been to please her, he had not ordered the more showy 
cheaper stuff but had insisted upon the simplest, plainest-looking appointments throughout. Even her bedroom 
furniture, even her dressing table set, was of the 
kind that suggests cost only to the experienced, 
carefully and well educated in values and in taste. 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I'm sure it isn't fair to charge <hi rend="italic">all</hi> these things 
to the company,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I can't allow it. Not 
the things for my personal use.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You <hi rend="italic">are</hi> a fierce watchdog of 
a treasurer,&rdquo; said 
Norman, laughing at her but noting and respecting the 
fine instinct of good breeding shown in her absence 
of greediness, of desire to get all she could. &ldquo;But I'm 
letting the firm of decorators take over what you leave  
behind in the old house. I'll see what they'll allow for 
it. Maybe that will cover the expense you object to.&rdquo; 
</p><p>This contented her. Nor was she in the least 
suspicious when he announced that the decorators had made 
such a liberal allowance that the deficit was but three 
hundred dollars. &ldquo;Those chaps,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;have 
a wide margin of profit. Besides, they're eager to get 
more and bigger work from me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>A few weeks, and he was enjoying the sight of her 
ensconced with her father in luxurious comfort   &mdash;   with 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0206" n="187"/>  
two servants, with a well-run house, with pleasant gardens, 
with all that is at the command of an income of 
six thousand a year in a comparatively inexpensive city. 
Only occasionally   &mdash;   and then not deeply   &mdash;   was he troubled 
by the reflection that he was still far from his goal 
   &mdash;   and had made apparently absurdly little progress 
toward it through all this maneuvering. The truth was, 
he preferred to linger when lingering gave him so many 
new kinds of pleasure. Of those in the large and 
motley company that sit down to the banquet of the 
senses, the most are crude, if not coarse, gluttons. They 
eat fast and furiously, having a raw appetite. Now 
and then there is one who has some idea of the art of 
enjoyment   &mdash;   the art of prolonging and varying both 
the joys of anticipation and the joys of realization. 
</p><p>He turned his attention to tempting her to extravagance 
in dress. Rut his success there was not all he 
could have wished. She wore better clothes   &mdash;   much 
better. She no longer looked the poor working girl, 
struggling desperately to be neat and clean. She had almost 
immediately taken on the air of the comfortable classes. 
Rut everything she got for herself was inexpensive. 
and she made dresses for herself, and trimmed all her 
hats. With the hats Norman found no fault. There 
her good taste produced about as satisfactory results as 
could have been got at the fashionable milliners   &mdash;   more 
satisfactory than are got by the women who go there, 
with no taste of their own beyond a hazy idea that they 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0207" n="188"/>  
want &ldquo;something like what Mrs. So-and-So is wearing.&rdquo; 
But homemade dresses were a different matter. 
</p><p>Norman longed to have her in toilettes that would 
bring out the full beauty of her marvelous figure. He, 
after the manner of the more intelligent and worldly-wise New York men, had some knowledge of women's 
clothes. His sister knew how to dress; Josephine knew 
how, though her taste was somewhat too sober to suit 
Norman   &mdash;   at least to suit him in Dorothy. He thought 
out and suggested dresses to Dorothy, and told her 
where to get them. Dorothy tried to carry out at home 
such of his suggestions as pleased her   &mdash;   for, like all 
women, she believed she knew how to dress herself. Her 
handiwork was creditable. It would have contented a 
less exacting and less trained taste than Norman's. It 
would have contented him had he not been infatuated 
with her beauty of face and form. As it was, the 
improvement in her appearance only served to intensify 
his agitation. He now saw in her not only all that 
had first conquered him, but also those unsuspected 
beauties and graces   &mdash;   and possibilities of beauty and 
grace yet more entrancing, were she but dressed properly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You don't begin to appreciate how beautiful you 
are,&rdquo; said he. It had ever been one of his rules in 
dealing with women to feed their physical vanity sparingly 
and cautiously, lest it should blaze up into one of 
those consuming flames that produce a very frenzy of 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0208" n="189"/>  
conceit. But this rule, like all the others, had gone by 
the board. He could not conceal his infatuation from 
her, not even when he saw that it was turning her head 
and making his task harder and harder. &ldquo;If you 
would only go over to New York to several dressmakers 
whose names I'll give you, I know you'd get clothes 
from them that you could touch up into something 
uncommon.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I can't afford it,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;What I have is good 
enough   &mdash;   and costs more than I've the right to pay.&rdquo; 
And her tone silenced him; it was the tone of finality, 
and he had discovered that she had a will. 
 
</p><p>Never before had Frederick Norman let any 
important thing drift. And when he started in with 
Dorothy he had no idea of changing that fixed policy. He 
would have scoffed if anyone had foretold to him that 
he would permit the days and the weeks to go by with 
nothing definite accomplished toward any definite 
purpose. Yet that was what occurred. Every time he 
came he had in mind a fixed resolve to make distinct 
progress with the girl. Every time he left he had a 
furious quarrel with himself for his weakness. &ldquo;She is 
making a fool of me,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;She <hi rend="italic">must</hi> 
be laughing at me.&rdquo;  But he returned only to repeat 
his folly, to add one more to the lengthening, mocking 
series of lost opportunities. 
</p><p>The truth lay deeper than he saw. He recognized 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0209" n="190"/>  
only his own weakness of the infatuated lover's fatuous 
timidity. He did not realize how potent her charm for 
him was, how completely content she made him when 
he was with her, just from the fact that they were 
together. After a time an unsatisfied passion often thus 
diffuses itself, ceases to be a narrow torrent, becomes a 
broad river whose resistless force is hidden beneath 
an appearance of sparkling calm. Her ingenuousness 
amused him; her developing taste and imagination 
interested him; her freshness, her freedom from any sense 
of his importance in the world fascinated him, and there 
was a keener pleasure than he dreamed in the novel 
sensation of breathing the perfume of what he, the one 
time cynic, would have staked his life on being unsullied 
purity. Their relations were to him a delightful 
variation upon the intimacy of master and pupil. Either 
he was listening to her or was answering her questions 
   &mdash;   and the time flew. And there never was a moment 
when he could have introduced the subject that most 
concerned him when he was not with her. To have 
introduced it would have been rudely to break the 
charm of a happy afternoon or evening. 
</p><p>Was she leading him on and on nowhere deliberately? 
Or was it the sweet and innocent simplicity it seemed? 
He could not tell. He would have broken the charm 
and put the matter to the test had he not been afraid 
of the consequences. What had he to fear?  Was she 
not in his power?  Was she not his, whenever he should 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0210" n="191"/>  
stretch forth his hand and claim her?  Yes   &mdash;   no doubt 
   &mdash;   not the slightest doubt. But   &mdash;     He was afraid to 
break the charm; it was such a satisfying charm. 
</p><p>Then   &mdash;   there was her father. 
</p><p>Men who arrive anywhere in any direction always 
have the habit of ignoring the nonessential more or less 
strongly developed. One reason   &mdash;   perhaps the chief 
reason   &mdash;   why Norman had got up to the high places 
of material success at so early an age was that he 
had an unerring instinct for the essential and wasted 
no time or energy upon the nonessential. In his present 
situation Dorothy's father, the abstracted man of 
science, was one of the factors that obviously fell into 
the nonessential class. Norman knew little about him, 
and cared less. Also, he took care to avoid knowing 
him. Knowing the father would open up possibilities 
of discomfort   &mdash;     But, being a wise young man, Norman 
gave this matter the least possible thought. 
</p><p>Still, it was necessary that the two men see 
something of each other. Hallowell discovered nothing 
about Norman, not enough about his personal appearance 
to have recognized him in the street far enough 
away from the laboratory to dissociate the two ideas. 
Human beings   &mdash;   except his daughter   &mdash;   did not interest 
Hallowell; and his feeling for her was somewhat in the 
nature of an abstraction. Norman, on the other hand, 
was intensely interested in human beings; indeed, he 
was interested in little else. He was always thrusting 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0211" n="192"/>  
through surfaces, probing into minds and souls. He 
sought thoroughly to understand the living machines 
he used in furthering his ambitions and desires. So it 
was not long before he learned much about old Newton 
Hallowell   &mdash;   and began to admire him   &mdash;   and with a man 
of Norman's temperament to admire is to like. 
</p><p>He had assumed at the outset that the scientist was 
more or less the crank. He had not talked with him 
many times before he discovered that, far from being 
in any respect a crank, he was a most able and well-balanced mentality   &mdash;   a genius. The day came when, 
Dorothy not having returned from a shopping tour, 
he lingered in the laboratory talking with the father, 
or, rather, listening while the man of great ideas 
unfolded to him conceptions of the world that set his 
imagination to soaring. 
</p><p>Most of us see but dimly beyond the ends of our 
noses, and visualize what lies within our range of sight 
most imperfectly. We know little about ourselves, less 
about others. We fancy that the world and the human 
race always have been about as they now are, and always 
will be. History reads to us like a fairy tale, to which 
we give conventional acceptance as truth. As to the 
future, we can conceive nothing but the continuation of 
just what we see about us in the present. Norman, 
practical man though he was, living in and for the 
present, had yet an imagination. He thought Hallowell 
a kind of fool for thinking only of the future and 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0212" n="193"/>  
working only for it   &mdash;   but he soon came to think him n 
divine fool. And through Hallowell's spectacles he was 
charmed for many an hour with visions of the world 
that is to be when, in the slow but steady processes of 
evolution, the human race will become intelligent, will 
conquer the universe with the weapons of science and 
will make it over. 
</p><p>When he first stated his projects to Norman, the 
young man had difficulty in restraining his amusement. 
A new idea, in any line of thought with which we are 
not familiar, always strikes us as ridiculous. Norman 
had been educated in the ignorant conventional way still 
in high repute among the vulgar and among those whose 
chief delight is to make the vulgar gape in awe. He 
therefore had no science, that is, no knowledge   &mdash;   outside 
his profession   &mdash;   but only what is called learning, though 
tommyrot would be a fitter name for it. He had only 
the most meager acquaintance with that great fundamental 
of a sound and sane education, embryology. He 
knew nothing of what science had already done to 
destroy all the still current notions about the mystery of 
life and birth. He still laughed, as at a clever bit of 
legerdemain, when Hallowell showed him how far science 
had progressed toward mastery of the life of the 
lower forms of existence   &mdash;   how those &ldquo;worms&rdquo; could be 
artificially created, could be aged, made young again, 
made diseased and decrepit, restored to perfect health, 
could be swung back and forth or sideways or sinuously 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0213" n="194"/>  
along the span of existence   &mdash;   could even be killed and 
brought back to vigor. 
</p><p>&ldquo;We've been at this sort of thing only a few 
years,&rdquo; said Hallowell. &ldquo;I rather think it will not be 
many years now before we shall not even need the initial 
germ of life to enable us to create but can do it by 
pure chemical means, just as a taper is lighted by holding 
a match to it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman ceased to think of sleight-of-hand. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; continued the juggler, transformed now into 
practical man, leader of men, &ldquo;life has been 
demonstrated to be simply one of the forms of energy, or 
one of the consequences of energy. The final discovery 
is scientifically not far away. Then   &mdash;   &rdquo;  His eyes 
lighted up. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; asked Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then immortality   &mdash;   in the body. Eternal youth 
and health. A body that is renewable much as any of 
our inanimate machines of the factory is renewable. 
Why not?  So far as we know, no living thing ever 
dies except by violence. Disease   &mdash;   old age   &mdash;   they are 
quite as much violence as the knife and the bullet. What 
science can now do with these `worms,' as my daughter 
calls them   &mdash;   that it will be able to do with the higher 
organisms.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And the world would soon be jammed to the last 
acre,&rdquo; objected Norman. 
</p><p>Hallowell shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Not at all. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0214" n="195"/>  
There will be no necessity to create new people, except 
to take the place of those who may be accidentally 
obliterated.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But the world is dying   &mdash;   the earth, itself, I mean.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;True. But science may learn how to arrest that 
cooling process   &mdash;   or to adapt man to it. Or, it may 
be that when the world ceases to be inhabitable we shall 
have learned how to cross the star spaces, as I think 
I've suggested before. Then   &mdash;   we should simply find a 
planet in its youth somewhere, and migrate to it, as a 
man now moves to a new house when the old ceases 
to please him.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That is a long flight of the fancy,&rdquo; said Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Long   &mdash;   but no stronger than the telegraph or the 
telephone. The trouble with us is that we have been 
long stupefied by the ignorant theological ideas of the 
universe   &mdash;   ideas that have come down to us from the 
childhood of the race. We haven't got used to the new 
era   &mdash;   the scientific era. And that is natural. Why, 
until less than three generations ago there was really 
no such thing as science.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I hadn't thought of that,&rdquo; admitted Norman. 
&ldquo;We certainly have got on very fast in those three 
generations.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Rather fast. Not so fast, however, as we shall 
in the next three. Science   &mdash;   chemistry   &mdash;   is going speedily 
to change all the conditions of life because it will turn 
topsy-turvy all the ways of producing things   &mdash;   food, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0215" n="196"/>  
clothing, shelter. Less than two generations ago men 
lived much as they had for thousands of years. But 
it's very different to-day. It will be inconceivably 
different to-morrow.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman could not get these ideas out of his brain. 
He began to understand why Hallowell cared nothing 
about the active life of the day   &mdash;   about its religion, 
politics, modes of labor, its habits of one creature preying 
upon another. To-morrow, not religion, not politics, 
but chemistry, not priests nor politicians, but chemists, 
would change all that   &mdash;   and change it by the only methods 
that compel. An abstract idea of liberty or justice 
can be rejected, evaded, nullified. But a telephone, a 
steam engine, a mode of prolonging life   &mdash;   those realizations 
of ideas <hi rend="italic">compel</hi>. 
</p><p>When Dorothy came, Norman went into the garden 
with her in a frame of mind so different from any he 
had ever before experienced that he scarcely recognized 
himself. As the influence of the father's glowing 
imagination of genius waned before the daughter's physical 
loveliness and enchantment for him, he said to himself, 
&ldquo;I'll keep away from him.&rdquo;  Why?  He did not permit 
himself to go on to examine into his reasons. But he 
could not conceal them from himself quickly enough 
to hide the knowledge that they were moral. 
</p><p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you to-day?&rdquo; said 
Dorothy. &ldquo;You are not a bit interesting.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Interested, you mean,&rdquo; he said with a smile of 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0216" n="197"/>  
raillery, for he had long since discovered that she was 
not without the feminine vanity that commands the 
centering of all interest in the woman herself and 
resents any wandering of thought as a slur upon her 
own powers of fascination. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Well, interested then,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You are thinking 
about something else.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; he assured her. 
</p><p>But he left early. No sooner had he got away from 
the house than the scientific dreaming vanished and he 
wished himself back with her again   &mdash;   back where every 
glance at her gave him the most exquisite sensations. 
And when he came the following day he apparently had 
once more restored her father to his proper place of a 
nonessential. All that definitely remained of the day 
before's impression was a certain satisfaction that he 
was aiding with his money an enterprise of greater 
value and of less questionable character than merely his 
own project. But the powerful influences upon our life 
and conduct are rarely direct and definite. He, quite 
unconsciously, had a wholly different feeling about 
Dorothy because of her father, because of what his new 
knowledge of and respect for her father had revealed 
and would continue to reveal to him as to the girl 
herself   &mdash;   her training, her inheritance, her character that 
could not but be touched with the splendor of the father's 
noble genius. And long afterward, when the father as 
a distinct personality had been almost forgotten, Norman 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0217" n="198"/>  
was still, altogether unconsciously, influenced by 
him   &mdash;   powerfully, perhaps decisively influenced. Norman 
had no notion of it, but ever after that talk in the 
laboratory, Dorothy Hallowell was to him Newton 
Hallowell's daughter. 
</p><p>When he came the following day, with his original 
purposes and plans once more intact, as he thought, he 
found that she had made more of a toilet than usual, 
had devised a new way of doing her hair that enabled 
him to hang a highly prized addition in his memory gallery 
of widely varied portraits of her. 
</p><p>The afternoon was warm. They sat under a big old 
tree at the end of the garden. He saw that she was 
much disturbed   &mdash;   and that it had to do with him. From 
time to time she looked at him, studying his face when 
she thought herself unobserved. As he had learned that 
it is never wise to open up the disagreeable, he waited. 
After making several futile efforts at conversation, she 
abruptly said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;I saw Mr. Tetlow this morning   &mdash;   in Twenty-third 
Street. I was coming out of a chemical supplies store 
where father had sent me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She paused. But Norman did not help her. He 
continued to wait. 
</p><p>&ldquo;He   &mdash;   Mr. Tetlow   &mdash;   acted very strangely,&rdquo; she went 
on. &ldquo;I spoke to him. He stared at me as if he weren't 
going to speak   &mdash;   as if I weren't fit to speak to.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Norman. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0218" n="199"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Then he came hurrying after me. And he said, 
`Do you know that Norman is to be married in two 
weeks?' &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; said Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;And I said, `What of it?  How does that interest 
me?' &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It didn't interest you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I was surprised that you hadn't spoken of it,&rdquo; 
replied she. &ldquo;But I was more interested in Mr. 
Tetlow's manner. What do you think he said next?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I can't imagine,&rdquo; said Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why   &mdash;   that I was even more shameless than he 
thought. He said:  `Oh, I know all about you. I found 
out by accident. I shan't tell anyone, for I can't help 
loving you still. But it has killed my belief in woman 
to find out that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would sell 
yourself.' &rdquo; 
</p><p>She was looking at Norman with eyes large and 
grave. &ldquo;And what did you say?&rdquo; he inquired. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I didn't say anything. I looked at him as if he 
weren't there and started on. Then he said, `When 
Norman abandons you, as he soon will, you can count 
on me, if you need a friend.' &rdquo; 
</p><p>There was a pause. Then Norman said, &ldquo;And 
that was all?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied she. 
</p><p>Another pause. Norman said musingly:  &ldquo;Poor 
Tetlow!  I've not seen him since he went away to 
Bermuda   &mdash;   at least he said he was going there. One 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0219" n="200"/>  
day he sent the firm a formal letter of resignation. . . . 
Poor Tetlow!  Do you regret not having married him?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn't marry a man I didn't love.&rdquo;  She looked 
at him with sweet friendly eyes. &ldquo;I couldn't even 
marry you, much as I like you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman laughed   &mdash;   a dismal attempt at ease and 
raillery. 
</p><p>&ldquo;When he told me about your marrying,&rdquo; she went 
on, &ldquo;I knew how I felt about you. For I was not a 
bit jealous. Why haven't you ever said anything 
about it?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He disregarded this. He leaned forward and with 
curious deliberateness took her hand. She let it lie 
gently in his. He put his arm round her and drew 
her close to him. She did not resist. He kissed her 
upturned face, kissed her upon the lips. She remained 
passive, looking at him with calm eyes. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Kiss me,&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>She kissed him   &mdash;   without hesitation and without 
warmth. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you look at me so?&rdquo; he demanded. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I can't understand.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Understand what?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why you should wish to kiss me when you love 
another woman. What would she say if she knew?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm sure I don't know. And I rather think I don't 
care. You are the only person on earth that interests me.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0220" n="201"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Then why are you marrying?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Let's not talk about that. Let's talk about 
ourselves.&rdquo;  He clasped her passionately, kissed her at first 
with self-restraint, then in a kind of frenzy. &ldquo;How 
can you be so cruel!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Are you utterly 
cold?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I do not love you,&rdquo; she said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;There's no reason. I   &mdash;   just don't. I've sometimes 
thought perhaps it was because you don't love me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Good God, Dorothy!  What do you want me to 
say or do?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied she calmly. &ldquo;You asked me 
why I didn't love you, and I was trying to explain. 
I don't want anything more than I'm getting. I am 
content   &mdash;   aren't you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Content!&rdquo;  He laughed sardonically. &ldquo;As well 
ask Tantalus if he is content, with the water always 
before his eyes and always out of reach. I want you 
   &mdash;   all you have to give. I couldn't be content with less.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You ought not to talk to me this way,&rdquo; she 
reproved gently, &ldquo;when you are engaged.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He flung her hand into her lap. &ldquo;You are making 
a fool of me. And I don't wonder. I've invited it. 
Surely, never since man was created has there been 
such another ass as I.&rdquo;  He drew her to her feet, seized 
her roughly by the shoulders. &ldquo;When are you coming 
to your senses?&rdquo; he demanded. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0221" n="202"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she inquired, in her child-like puzzled way. 
</p><p>He shook her, kissed her violently, held her at 
arm's length. &ldquo;Do you think it wise to trifle with 
me?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Don't your good sense tell you 
there's a limit even to such folly as mine?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the matter?&rdquo; she 
asked pathetically. 
&ldquo;What do you want?  I can't give you what I haven't 
got to give.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;But I want what you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> got 
to give.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She shook her head slowly. &ldquo;Really, I haven't, Mr. 
Norman.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He eyed her with cynical amused suspicion. &ldquo;Why 
did you call me <hi rend="italic">Mr</hi>. Norman just then?  
Usually you 
don't call me at all. It's been weeks since you have 
called me Mister. Was your doing it just then one of 
those subtle, adroit, timely tricks of yours?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was the picture of puzzled innocence. &ldquo;I don't 
understand,&rdquo; she said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Well   &mdash;   perhaps you don't,&rdquo; said he doubtfully. 
&ldquo;At any rate, don't call me Mr. Norman. Call me 
Fred.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I can't. It isn't natural. You seem Mister to 
me. I always think of you as Mr. Norman.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's it. And it must stop!&rdquo; 
</p><p>She smiled with innocent gayety. &ldquo;Very well   &mdash;    
Fred. . . . Fred. . . . Now that I've said it, I don't find 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0222" n="203"/>  
it strange.&rdquo;  She looked at him with an expression 
between appeal and mockery. &ldquo;If you'd only let me get 
acquainted with you. But you don't. You make me 
feel that I've got to be careful with you   &mdash;   that I must 
be on my guard. I don't know against what   &mdash;   for you 
are certainly the very best friend that I've ever had   &mdash;    
the only real friend.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He frowned and bit his lip   &mdash;   and felt uncomfortable, 
though he protested to himself that he was simply 
irritated at her slyness. Yes, it must be slyness. 
</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;there's no <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> for being 
on guard. Still, I feel that way.&rdquo;  She looked at him 
with sweet gravity. &ldquo;Perhaps I shouldn't if you didn't 
talk about love to me and kiss me in a way I feel you've 
no right to.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Again he laid his hands upon her shoulders. This 
time he gazed angrily into her eyes. &ldquo;Are you a fool? 
Or are you making a fool of me?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can't 
decide which.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I certainly am very foolish,&rdquo; was her apologetic 
answer. &ldquo;I don't know a lot of things, like you and 
father. I'm only a girl.&rdquo; 
</p><p>And he had the maddening sense of being baffled 
again   &mdash;   of having got nowhere, of having demonstrated 
afresh to himself and to her his own weakness where she 
was concerned. What unbelievable weakness!  Had 
there ever been such another case?  Yes, there must 
have been. How little he had known of the possibilities 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0223" n="204"/>  
of the relations of men and women   &mdash;   he who had 
prided himself on knowing all! 
</p><p>She said, &ldquo;You are going to marry?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; replied he sourly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Are you worried about the expense?  Is it costing 
you too much, this helping father?  Are you sorry you 
went into it?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He was silent. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You are sorry?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You feel that 
you are wasting your money?&rdquo; 
</p><p>His generosity forbade him to keep up the pretense 
that might aid him in his project. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said 
hastily. &ldquo;No, indeed. This expense   &mdash;   it's nothing.&rdquo; 
He flushed, hung his head in shame before his own 
weakness, as he added, in complete surrender, &ldquo;I'm very 
glad to be helping your father.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I knew you would be!&rdquo; she cried triumphantly. 
&ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo;  And she flung her arms round his neck 
and kissed him. 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's better!&rdquo; he said with a foolishly delighted 
laugh. &ldquo;I believe we are beginning to get acquainted.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. I feel quite different already.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I hoped so. You are coming to your senses?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps. Only   &mdash;   &rdquo;  She laid a beautiful white 
pleading hand upon his shoulder and gazed earnestly 
into his eyes   &mdash;   &ldquo;please don't frighten me with that talk 
   &mdash;   and those other kisses.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He looked at her uncertainly. &ldquo;Come round in 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0224" n="205"/>  
your own way,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I don't want to 
hurry you. I suppose every bird has its own way of 
dropping from a perch.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You don't like my way?&rdquo; she inquired. 
</p><p>It was said archly but also in the way that always 
made him vaguely uneasy, made him feel like one facing 
a mystery which should be explored cautiously. &ldquo;It 
is graceful,&rdquo; he admitted, with a smile since he could 
not venture to frown. &ldquo;Graceful   &mdash;   but slow.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She laughed   &mdash;   and he could not but feel that the 
greater laughter in her too innocent eyes was directed 
at him. She talked of other things   &mdash;   and he let her   &mdash;    
charmed, yet cursing his folly, his slavery, the while.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="10" id="d16"> 
<head>X</head> 
<p>MANY a time he had pitied a woman for letting him 
get away from her, when she obviously wished to hold 
him and failed solely because she did not understand 
her business. Like every other man, he no sooner began 
to be attracted by a woman than he began to invest her 
with a mystery and awe which she either could 
dissipate by forcing him to see the truth of her 
commonplaceness or could increase into a power that would 
enslave him by keeping him agitated and interested and 
ever satisfied yet ever baffled. But no woman had shown 
this supreme skill in the art of love   &mdash;   until Dorothy 
Hallowell. She exasperated him. She fascinated him. 
She kept him so restless that his professional work was 
all but neglected. Was it her skill?  Was it her folly? 
Was she simply leading him on and on, guided blindly 
by woman's instinct to get as much as she could and 
to give as little as she dared?  Or was she protected 
by a real indifference to him   &mdash;   the strongest, indeed the 
only invulnerable armor a woman can wear?  Was she 
protecting herself?  Or was it merely that he, weakened 
by his infatuation, was doing the protecting for 
her? 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0226" n="207"/>  
</p><p>Beside these distracting questions, the once all-important matter of professional and worldly ambition 
seemed not worth troubling about. They even so vexed 
him that he had become profoundly indifferent as to 
Josephine. He saw her rarely. When they were alone 
he either talked neutral subjects or sat almost mute, 
hardly conscious of her presence. He received her 
efforts at the customary caressings with such stolidity 
that she soon ceased to annoy him. They reduced their 
outward show of affection to a kiss when they met, 
another when they separated. He was tired   &mdash;   always tired 
   &mdash;   worn out   &mdash;   half sick   &mdash;   harassed by business concerns. 
He did not trouble himself about whether his listless 
excuses would be accepted or not. He did not care what 
she thought   &mdash;   or might think   &mdash;   or might do. 
</p><p>Josephine was typical of the women of the 
comfortable class. For them the fundamentally vital 
matters of life   &mdash;   the profoundly harassing questions of food, 
clothing, and shelter   &mdash;   are arranged and settled. What 
is there left to occupy their minds?  Little but the idle 
emotions they manufacture and spread foglike over 
their true natures to hide the barrenness, the monotony. 
They fool with phrases about art or love or religion 
or charity   &mdash;   for none of those things can be vivid realities 
to those who are swathed and stupefied in a luxury 
they have not to take the least thought to provide for 
themselves. Like all those women, Josephine fancied 
herself complex   &mdash;   fancied she was a person of variety 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0227" n="208"/>  
and of depth because she repeated with a slight change 
of wording the things she read in clever books or heard 
from clever men. There seemed to Norman to be small 
enough originality, personality, to the ordinary man 
of the comfortable class; but there was some, because 
his necessity of struggling with and against his fellow 
men in the several arenas of active life compelled him to 
be at least a little of a person. In the women there 
seemed nothing at all   &mdash;   not even in Josephine. When 
he listened to her, when he thought of her, now   &mdash;   he 
was calmly critical. He judged her as a human 
specimen   &mdash;   judged much as would have old Newton Hallowell 
to whom the whole world was mere laboratory. 
</p><p>She bored him now   &mdash;   and he made no effort beyond 
bare politeness to conceal the fact from her. The situation 
was saved from becoming intolerable by that universal 
saver of intolerable situations, vanity. She had 
the ordinary human vanity. In addition, she had the 
peculiar vanity of woman, the creation of man's 
flatteries lavished upon the sex he alternately serves and 
spurns. In further addition, she had the vanity of her 
class   &mdash;   the comfortable class that feels superior to the 
mass of mankind in fortune, in intellect, in taste, in 
everything desirable. Heaped upon all these vanities 
was her vanity of high social rank   &mdash;   and atop the whole 
her vanity of great wealth. None but the sweetest and 
simplest of human beings can stand up and remain 
human under such a weight as this. If we are at all 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0228" n="209"/>  
fair in our judgments of our fellow men, we marvel 
that the triumphant class   &mdash;   especially the women, whose 
point of view is never corrected by the experiences of 
practical life   &mdash;   are not more arrogant, more absurdly 
forgetful of the oneness and the feebleness of humanity. 
</p><p>Josephine was by nature one of the sweet and simple 
souls. And her love for Norman, after the habit of 
genuine love, had destroyed all the instinct of coquetry. 
The woman   &mdash;   or, the man   &mdash;   has to be indeed interesting, 
indeed an individuality, to remain interesting when 
sincerely in love, and so elevated above the petty but 
potent sex trickeries. Josephine, deeply in love, was 
showing herself to Norman in her undisguised natural 
sweet simplicity   &mdash;   and monotony. But, while men 
admire and reverence a sweet and simple feminine soul   &mdash;    
and love her in plays and between the covers of a book 
and when she is talking highfaluting abstractions of 
morality   &mdash;   and wax wroth with any other man who 
ignores or neglects her   &mdash;   they do not in their own persons 
become infatuated with her. Passion is too much 
given to moods for that; it has a morbid craving for 
variety, for the mysterious and the baffling. 
</p><p>The only thing that saves the race from ruin 
through passion is the rarity of those by nature or by 
art expert in using it. Norman felt that he was paying 
the penalty for his persistent search for this rarity; one 
of the basest tricks of destiny upon man is to give him 
what he wants   &mdash;   wealth, or fame, or power, or the woman 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0229" n="210"/>  
who enslaves. Norman felt that destiny had suddenly 
revealed its resolve to destroy him by giving him not 
one of the things he wanted, but all. 
</p><p>The marriage was not quite two weeks away. About 
the time that the ordinary plausible excuses for 
Norman's neglect, his abstraction, his seeming indifference 
were exhausted, Josephine's vanity came forward to 
explain everything to her, all to her own glory. As the 
elysian hour approached   &mdash;   so vanity assured her   &mdash;   the 
man who loved her as her complex soul and many physical 
and social advantages deserved was overcome with 
that shy terror of which she had read in the poets and 
the novelists. A large income, fashionable attire and 
surroundings, a carriage and a maid   &mdash;   these things gave 
a woman a subtle and superior intellect and soul. How? 
Why?  No one knew. But everyone admitted, indeed 
saw, the truth. Further, these beings   &mdash;   these great 
ladies   &mdash;   according to all the accredited poets, novelists, 
and other final authorities upon life   &mdash;   always inspired 
the most awed and worshipful and diffident feelings in 
their lovers. Therefore, she   &mdash;   the great lady   &mdash;   was 
getting but her due. She would have liked something else 
   &mdash;   something common and human   &mdash;   much better. But, 
having always led her life as the conventions dictated, 
never as the common human heart yearned, she had no 
keen sense of dissatisfaction to rouse her to revolt and 
to question. Also, she was breathlessly busy with 
trousseau and the other arrangements for the grand wedding. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0230" n="211"/>  
</p><p>One afternoon she telephoned Norman asking him 
to come on his way home that evening. &ldquo;I particularly 
wish to see you,&rdquo; she said. He thought her voice 
sounded rather queer, but he did not take sufficient 
interest to speculate about it. When he was with her 
in the small drawing room on the second floor, he noted 
that her eyes were regarding him strangely. He 
thought he understood why when she said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;Aren't you going to kiss me, Fred?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He put on his good-natured, slightly mocking smile. 
&ldquo;I thought you were too busy for that sort of thing 
nowadays.&rdquo;  And he bent and kissed her waiting lips. 
Then he lit a cigarette and seated himself on the sofa 
beside her   &mdash;   the sofa at right angles to the open fire. 
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>She gazed into the fire for full a minute before she 
said in a voice of constraint, &ldquo;What became of that   &mdash;    
that girl   &mdash;   the Miss Hallowell   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>She broke off abruptly. There was a pause choked 
with those dizzy pulsations that fill moments of silence 
and strain. Then with a sob she flung herself against 
his breast and buried her face in his shoulder. &ldquo;Don't 
answer!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I'm ashamed of myself. I'm 
ashamed   &mdash;   ashamed!&rdquo; 
</p><p>He put his arm about her shoulders. &ldquo;But why 
shouldn't I answer?&rdquo; said he in the kindly gentle tone 
we can all assume when a matter that agitates some one 
else is wholly indifferent to us. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0231" n="212"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Because   &mdash;   it was a   &mdash;   a trap,&rdquo; she answered 
hysterically. &ldquo;Fred   &mdash;   there was a man here this afternoon 
   &mdash;   a man named Tetlow. He got in only because he 
said he came from you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman laughed quietly. &ldquo;Poor Tetlow!&rdquo; he said. 
&ldquo;He used to be your head clerk   &mdash;   didn't he?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And one of my few friends.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;He's not your friend, Fred!&rdquo; she cried, sitting 
upright and speaking with energy that quivered in her 
voice and flashed in her fine brown eyes. &ldquo;He's your 
enemy   &mdash;   a snake in the grass   &mdash;   a malicious, poisonous   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman's quiet, even laugh interrupted. &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; 
said he. &ldquo;Tetlow's a good fellow. Anything he said 
would be what he honestly believed   &mdash;   anything he said 
about me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;He pleaded that he was doing it for your good,&rdquo; 
she went on with scorn. &ldquo;They always do   &mdash;   like the 
people that write father wicked anonymous letters. He 
   &mdash;   this man Tetlow   &mdash;   he said he wanted me for the sake 
of my love for you to save you from yourself.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman glanced at her with amused eyes. &ldquo;Well, 
why don't you?  But then you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> doing 
it. You're 
marrying me, aren't you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Again she put her head upon his shoulder. &ldquo;Indeed 
I am!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;And I'd be a poor sort if I 
let a sneak shake my confidence in you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He patted her shoulder, and there was laughter in 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0232" n="213"/>  
his voice as he said, &ldquo;But I never professed to be 
trustworthy.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I know you <hi rend="italic">used</hi> to   &mdash;   &rdquo;  
She laughed and 
kissed his cheek. &ldquo;Never mind. I've heard. But while 
you were engaged to me   &mdash;   about to marry me   &mdash;   why, 
you simply couldn't!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Couldn't what?&rdquo; inquired he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to tell you what he said?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I think I know. But do as you like.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe I'd better tell you. I seem to want to get 
rid of it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then do.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It was about that girl.&rdquo;  She sat upright and 
looked at him for encouragement. He nodded. She 
went on:  &ldquo;He said that if I asked you, you would not 
dare deny you were   &mdash;   were   &mdash;   giving her money.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Her and her father.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She shrank, startled. Then her lips smiled bravely, 
and she said, &ldquo;He didn't say anything about her 
father.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No. That was my own correction of his story.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She looked at him with wonder and doubt. &ldquo;You 
aren't   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> it, Fred!&rdquo; she 
exclaimed. 
</p><p>He nodded. &ldquo;Yes, indeed.&rdquo;  He looked at her 
placidly. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You are <hi rend="italic">supporting</hi> her?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;If you wish to put it that way,&rdquo; said he 
carelessly. &ldquo;My money pays the bills   &mdash;   all the bills.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0233" n="214"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Fred!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?  What is it?  Why are you so agitated?&rdquo; 
He studied her face, then rose, took a final pull at the 
cigarette, tossed it in the fire. &ldquo;I must be going,&rdquo; he 
said, in a cool, even voice. 
</p><p>She started up in a panic. &ldquo;Fred!  What do you 
mean?  Are you angry with me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>His calm regard met hers. &ldquo;I do not like   &mdash;   this 
sort of thing,&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;But surely you'll explain. Surely I'm entitled to 
an explanation.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why should <hi rend="italic">I</hi> explain?  You 
have evidently found 
an explanation that satisfies you.&rdquo;  He drew himself 
up in a quiet gesture of haughtiness. &ldquo;Besides, it has 
never been my habit to allow myself to be questioned or 
to explain myself.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her eyes widened with terror. &ldquo;Fred!&rdquo; she 
gasped. &ldquo;What <hi rend="italic">do</hi> you mean?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Precisely what I say,&rdquo; said he, in the same cool, 
inevitable way. &ldquo;A man came to you with a story 
about me. You listened. A sufficient answer to the 
story was that I am marrying you. That answer 
apparently does not content you. Very well. I shall 
make no other.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She gazed at him uncertainly. She felt him going 
   &mdash;   and going finally. She seized him with desperate 
fingers, cried:  &ldquo;I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> content. Oh, 
Fred   &mdash;   don't frighten 
me this way!&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0234" n="215"/>  
</p><p>He smiled satirically. &ldquo;Are you afraid of the 
scandal   &mdash;   because everything for the wedding has gone 
so far?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;How can you think that!&rdquo; cried she   &mdash;   perhaps too 
vigorously, a woman would have thought. 
</p><p>&ldquo;What else is there for me to think?  You certainly 
haven't shown any consideration for me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But you told me yourself that you were false 
to me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Really?  When?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She forgot her fear in a gush of rage rising from 
sudden realization of what she was doing   &mdash;   of how 
leniently and weakly and without pride she was dealing 
with this man. &ldquo;Didn't you admit   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said he, and his manner might well 
have calmed the wildest tempest of anger. &ldquo;I did not 
admit. I never admit. I leave that to people of the 
sort who explain and excuse and apologize. I simply 
told you I was paying the expenses of a family named 
Hallowell.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But <hi rend="italic">why</hi> should you do it, 
Fred?&rdquo; 
</p><p>His smile was gently satirical. &ldquo;I thought Tetlow 
told you why.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't believe him!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then why this excitement?&rdquo; 
</p><p>One could understand how the opposition witnesses 
dreaded facing him. &ldquo;I don't know just why,&rdquo; she 
stammered. &ldquo;It seemed to me you were admitting   &mdash;    
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0235" n="216"/>  
I mean, you were confirming what that man accused 
you of.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And of what did he accuse me?  I might say, of 
what do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> accuse me?&rdquo;  When she 
remained silent 
he went on:  &ldquo;I am trying to be reasonable, Josephine. 
I am trying to keep my temper.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The look in her eyes   &mdash;   the fear, the timidity   &mdash;   was 
a startling revelation of character   &mdash;   of the cowardice 
with which love undermines the strongest nature. &ldquo;I 
know I've been foolish and incoherent, Fred,&rdquo; she 
pleaded. &ldquo;But   &mdash;   I love you!  And you remember how 
I always was afraid of that girl.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Just what do you wish to know?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, dear   &mdash;   nothing. I am not sillily jealous. 
I ought to be admiring you for your generosity   &mdash;   your 
charity.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It's neither the one nor the other,&rdquo; said he with 
exasperating deliberateness. 
</p><p>She quivered. &ldquo;Then <hi rend="italic">what</hi> is 
it?&rdquo; she cried. 
&ldquo;You are driving me crazy with your evasions.&rdquo; 
Pleadingly, &ldquo;You must admit they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> 
evasions.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He buttoned his coat in tranquil preparation to 
depart. She instantly took alarm. &ldquo;I don't mean that. 
It's my fault, not asking you straight out. Fred, tell 
me   &mdash;   won't you?  But if you are too cross with me, 
then   &mdash;   don't tell me.&rdquo;  She laughed nervously, hiding 
her submission beneath a seeming of mocking exaggeration 
of humility. &ldquo;I'll be good. I'll behave.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0236" n="217"/>  
</p><p>A man who admired her as a figure, a man who liked 
her, a man who had no feeling for her beyond the 
general human feeling of wishing well pretty nearly 
everybody   &mdash;   in brief, any man but one who had loved her 
and had gotten over it would have deeply pitied and 
sympathized with her. Fred Norman said, his look and 
his tone coolly calm: 
</p><p>&ldquo;I am backing Mr. Hallowell in a company for 
which he is doing chemical research work. We are 
hatching eggs, out of the shell, so to speak. Also we 
are aging and rejuvenating arthropods and the like. So 
far we have declared no dividends. But we have hopes.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She gave a hysterical sob of relief. &ldquo;Then it's only 
business   &mdash;   not the girl at all!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it's the girl, too,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;She's 
an officer of the company. In fact, it was to make a 
place for her that I went into the enterprise originally.&rdquo; 
With an engaging air of frankness he inquired, &ldquo;Anything more?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was gazing soberly, almost somberly, into the 
fire. &ldquo;You'll not be offended if I ask you one question?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Is there anything between you and   &mdash;   her?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You mean, am I having an affair with her?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She hung her head, but managed to make a slight 
nod of assent. 
</p><p>He laughed. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  He laughed again. &ldquo;No   &mdash;    
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0237" n="218"/>  
not thus far, my dear.&rdquo;  He laughed a third time, with 
still stronger and stranger mockery. &ldquo;She congratulated 
me on my engagement with a sincerity that would 
have piqued a man who was interested in her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Will you forgive me?&rdquo; Josephine said. &ldquo;What 
I've just been feeling and saying and putting you 
through   &mdash;   it's beneath both of us. I suppose a woman 
   &mdash;   no woman   &mdash;   can help being nasty where another woman 
is concerned.&rdquo; 
</p><p>With his satirical good-humored smile, &ldquo;I don't in 
the least blame you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And you'll not think less of me for giving way 
to a thing so vulgar?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He kissed her with a carelessness that made her 
wince But she felt that she deserved it   &mdash;   and was 
grateful. He said:  &ldquo;Why don't you go over and see 
for yourself?  No doubt Tetlow gave you the address 
   &mdash;   and no doubt you have remembered it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She colored and hastily turned her head. &ldquo;Don't 
punish me,&rdquo; she pleaded. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Punish you?  What nonsense! . . . Do you want 
me to take you over?  The laboratory would interest 
you   &mdash;   and Miss Hallowell is lovelier than ever. She 
has an easier life now. Office work wears on women 
terribly.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Josephine looked at him with a beautiful smile of 
love and trust. &ldquo;You wish to be sure I'm cured. Well, 
can't you see that I am?&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0238" n="219"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't see why you should be. I've said nothing 
one way or the other.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She laughed gayly. &ldquo;You can't tempt me. I'm 
really cured. I think the only reason I had the attack 
was because Mr. Tetlow so evidently believed he was 
speaking the truth.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No doubt he did think he was. I'm sure, in the 
same circumstances, I'd think of anyone else just what 
he thinks of me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then why do you do it, Fred?&rdquo; urged she with 
ill-concealed eagerness. &ldquo;It isn't fair to the girl, is 
it?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No one but you and Tetlow knows I'm doing it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You're mistaken there, dear. Tetlow says a great 
many people down town are talking about it   &mdash;   that they 
say you go almost every day to Jersey City to see her. 
He accuses you of having ruined her reputation. He 
says she is quite innocent. He blames the whole thing 
upon you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman, standing with arms folded upon his broad 
chest, was gazing thoughtfully into the fire. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You don't mind my telling you these things?&rdquo; she 
said anxiously. &ldquo;Of course, I know they are lies   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;So everyone is talking about it,&rdquo; interrupted he, 
so absorbed that he had not heard her. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You don't realize how conspicuous you are.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Well, it can't be 
helped.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0239" n="220"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;You can't afford to be mixed up in a scandal,&rdquo; she 
ventured, &ldquo;or to injure a poor little creature   &mdash;     I'm 
afraid you'll have to   &mdash;   to stop it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Stop it.&rdquo;  His eyes gleamed with mirth and something 
else. &ldquo;It isn't my habit to heed gossip.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But think of <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, Fred!&rdquo; 
</p><p>He smiled ironically. &ldquo;What a generous, thoughtful 
dear you are!&rdquo; said he. 
</p><p>She blushed. &ldquo;I'll admit I don't like it. I'm not 
jealous   &mdash;   but I wish you weren't doing it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with sudden energy that 
astonished and disquieted her. &ldquo;So do I!  But since 
it can't be helped I shall go on.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Never had she respected him so profoundly. For 
the first time she had measured strength with him and 
had been beaten and routed. She fancied herself 
enormously proud; for she labored under the common 
delusion which mistakes for pride the silly vanity of class, 
or birth, or wealth, or position. She had imagined she 
would never lower that cherished pride of hers to any 
man. And she had lowered it into the dust. No wonder 
women had loved him, she said to herself; couldn't he 
do with them, even the haughtiest of them, precisely as 
he pleased?  He had not tried to calm, much less to 
end her jealousy; on the contrary, he had let it flame 
as high as it would, had urged it higher. And she did 
not dare ask him, even as a loving concession to her 
weakness, to give up an affair upon which everybody 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0240" n="221"/>  
was putting the natural worst possible construction! 
On the contrary, she had given him leave to go on   &mdash;    
because she feared   &mdash;   yes, knew   &mdash;   that if she tried to 
interfere he would take it as evidence that they could 
not get on together. What a man! 
 
</p><p>But there was more to come that day. As he was 
finishing dressing for dinner his sister Ursula knocked. 
&ldquo;May I come, Frederick?&rdquo; she said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I'm fixing my tie.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Ursula, in a gown that displayed the last possible 
   &mdash;   many of the homelier women said impossible   &mdash;   inch of 
her beautiful shoulders, came strolling sinuously in and 
seated herself on the arm of the divan. She watched 
him, in his evening shirt, as he with much struggling 
did his tie. &ldquo;How young you do look, Fred!&rdquo; said 
she. &ldquo;Especially in just that much clothes. Not a 
day over thirty.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm not exactly a nonogenarian,&rdquo; retorted he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;But usually your face   &mdash;   in spite of its smoothness 
and no wrinkles   &mdash;   has a kind of an old young   &mdash;   or do 
I mean young old?   &mdash;   look. You've led such a serious 
life.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Um. That's the devil of it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You're looking particularly young to-night.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Same to you, Urse.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No, I'm not bad for thirty-four. People half 
believe me when I say I'm twenty-nine.&rdquo;  She glanced 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0241" n="222"/>  
complacently down at her softly glistening shoulders. 
&ldquo;I've still got my skin.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And a mighty good one it is. Best I ever saw   &mdash;    
except one.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She reflected a moment, then smiled. &ldquo;I know it 
isn't Josephine's. Hers is good but not notable. Eyes 
and teeth are her strongholds. I suppose it's   &mdash;   the 
other lady's.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I mean the one in Jersey City.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He went on brushing his hair with not a glance at 
the bomb she had exploded under his very nose. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You're a cool one,&rdquo; she said admiringly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Cool?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you'd jump. I'm sure you never 
dreamed I knew.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He slid into his white waistcoat and began to button it. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Though you might know I'd find out,&rdquo; she went 
on, &ldquo;when everyone's talking.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone's always talking,&rdquo; said he indifferently. 
</p><p>&ldquo;And they rattle on to beat the band when they 
get a chance at a man like you. Do you know what 
they're saying?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly. Loosen these straps in the back of my 
waistcoat   &mdash;   the upper ones, won't you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>As she fussed with the buckles she said:  &ldquo;But you 
don't know that they say you're going to pieces   &mdash;    
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0242"/>  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0243"/> 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0244" n="223"/>  
neglecting your cases   &mdash;   keeping away from your office 
   &mdash;   wasting about half of your day with your lady love. 
They say that you have gone stark mad   &mdash;   that you are 
rushing to ruin.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;A little looser. That's better. Thanks.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And everyone's wondering when Josephine will 
hear and go on the rampage. She's so proud and so 
stuck on herself that they're betting she'll give you 
the bounce.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Well   &mdash;   &rdquo; getting into his coat   &mdash;   &ldquo;you'd delight in 
that. For you don't like her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh   &mdash;   so   &mdash;   so,&rdquo; replied Ursula. &ldquo;She's all right, 
as women go. You know we women don't ever think 
any too well of each other. We're `on.'  Now, I'm 
frank to admit I'm not worth the powder to blow me 
up. I can't do anything worth doing. I don't know 
anything worth knowing   &mdash;   except how to dress and make 
a fool of an occasional man. I'm not a good house-keeper, nor a good wife   &mdash;   and I'd as lief go to jail for 
two years as have a baby. But <hi rend="italic">I</hi> admit 
I'm n. g. 
Most women are as poor excuses as I am, yet they 
think they're <hi rend="italic">grand!</hi>&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman, standing before his sister and smiling 
mysteriously, said:  &ldquo;My dear Urse, let me give you a great 
truth in a sentence. The value of anything is not its 
value to itself or in itself, but its value to some one else. 
A woman   &mdash;   even as incompetent a person as you   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Or Josephine.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0245" n="224"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;   &mdash;   or Josephine   &mdash;   may seem to some man to be 
pricelessly valuable. And if she happens to seem so to 
him, why, she <hi rend="italic">is</hi> so.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Meaning   &mdash;   Jersey City?&rdquo; 
</p><p>His eyes glittered curiously. &ldquo;Meaning Jersey 
City,&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>A long silence. Then Ursula:  &ldquo;But suppose 
Josephine hears?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He stood beside the doorway, waiting for her to 
pass out. His face expressed nothing. &ldquo;Let's go 
down. I'm hungry. We were talking about it this 
afternoon.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You and Jo!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Josephine and I.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And it's all right?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You fooled her?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't stoop to that sort of thing.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;You rise to heights 
of deception that would make anyone else giddy. Oh, 
I'd give anything to have heard.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;There's nothing to deceive about,&rdquo; said he. 
</p><p>She shook her head. &ldquo;You can't put it over me, 
Fred. You've never before made a fool of yourself 
about a woman. I'd like to see her. I suppose I'd 
be amazed. I've observed that the women who do the 
most extraordinary things with men are the most ordinary 
sort of women.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0246" n="225"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Not to the men,&rdquo; said he bitterly. &ldquo;Not while 
they're doing it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Does <hi rend="italic">she</hi> seem extraordinary 
to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> still?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He thrust his hands deep in his pockets. &ldquo;What 
you heard is true. I'm letting everything slide   &mdash;   work 
   &mdash;   career   &mdash;   everything. I think of nothing else. Ursula, 
I'm mad about her   &mdash;   mad!&rdquo; 
</p><p>She threw back her head, looked at him admiringly. 
Never had she so utterly worshiped this wonderful, 
powerful brother of hers. He was in love   &mdash;   really   &mdash;    
madly in love   &mdash;   at last. So he was perfect!  &ldquo;How 
long do you think it will hold, Fred?&rdquo; she said, all 
sympathy. 
</p><p>&ldquo;God knows!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yet   &mdash;   caring for her you can go on and marry 
another woman!&rdquo; 
</p><p>He looked at his sister cynically. &ldquo;You wouldn't 
have me marry <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, would you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; protested she hastily. Her 
passion for romance did not carry her to that idiocy. 
&ldquo;You couldn't. She's a sort of working girl   &mdash;   isn't 
she?   &mdash;   anyhow, that class. No, you couldn't marry 
her. But how can you marry another woman?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;How could I give up Josephine?   &mdash;   and give her 
up probably to Bob Culver?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Ursula nodded understandingly. &ldquo;But   &mdash;   what are 
you going to do?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;How should I know?  Perhaps break it off when 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0247" n="226"/>  
I marry   &mdash;   if you can call it breaking off, when there's 
nothing to break but   &mdash;   me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You don't mean   &mdash;   &rdquo; she cried, stopping when her 
tone had carried her meaning. 
</p><p>He laughed. &ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   that's the kind of damn fool 
I've been.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You must have let her see how crazy you were 
about her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Was anyone ever able to hide that sort of insanity?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Ursula gazed wonderingly at him, drew a long 
breath. &ldquo;You!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Of all men   &mdash;   you!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Let's go down.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She must be a deep one   &mdash;   dangerous,&rdquo; said Ursula, 
furious against the woman who was daring to resist her 
matchless brother. &ldquo;Fred, I'm wild to see her. Maybe 
I'd see something that'd help cure you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You keep out of it,&rdquo; he replied, curtly but not 
with ill humor. 
</p><p>&ldquo;It can't last long.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It'd do for me, if it did.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;The marriage will settle everything,&rdquo; said Ursula 
with confidence. 
</p><p>&ldquo;It's got to,&rdquo; said he grimly.</p>

<p>THE next day or the next but one Dorothy 
telephoned him. He often called her up on one pretext 
or another, or frankly for no reason at all beyond the 
overwhelming desire to hear her voice. But she had 
never before &ldquo;disturbed&rdquo; him. He had again and 
again assured her that he would not regard himself 
as &ldquo;disturbed,&rdquo; no matter what he might be doing. She 
would not have it so. As he was always watching for 
some faint sign that she was really interested in him, 
this call gave him a thrill of hope   &mdash;   a specimen of the 
minor absurdities of those days of extravagant folly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Are you coming over to-day?&rdquo; she asked. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Right away, if you wish.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Any time will do.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'll come at once. I'm not busy.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No. Late this afternoon. Father asked me to 
call up and make sure. He wants to see you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh   &mdash;   not you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm a business person,&rdquo; retorted she. &ldquo;I know 
better than to annoy you, as I've often said.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He knew it was foolish, tiresome; yet he could not 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0249" n="228"/>  
resist the impulse to say, &ldquo;Now that I've heard your 
voice I can't stay away. I'll come over to lunch.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her answering voice was irritated. &ldquo;Please don't. 
I'm cleaning house. You'd be in the way.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He shrank and quivered like a boy who has been 
publicly rebuked. &ldquo;I'll come when you say,&rdquo; he replied. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not a minute before four o'clock.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's a long time   &mdash;   now you've made me crazy 
to see you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't talk nonsense. I must go back to work.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he asked, to detain her. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Dusting and polishing. Molly did the sweeping 
and is cleaning windows now.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What have you got on?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;How silly you are!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No one knows that better than I. But I want 
to have a picture of you to look at.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've got on an old white skirt and an old shirt 
waist, both dirty, and a pair of tennis shoes that were 
white once but are gray now, where they aren't black. 
And I've got a pink chiffon rag tied round my hair.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Pink is wonderful when you wear it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I look a fright. And my face is streaked   &mdash;   and 
my arms.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you've got your sleeves rolled up. That's an 
important detail.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You're making fun of me.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0250" n="229"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;No, I'm thinking of your arms. They are   &mdash;    
ravishing.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's quite enough. Good-by.&rdquo; 
</p><p>And she rang off. He was used to her treating 
compliment and flattery from him in that fashion. He 
could not   &mdash;   or was it would not?   &mdash;   understand why. He 
had learned that she was not at all the indifferent and 
unaware person in the matter of her physical charms 
he had at first fancied her. On the contrary, she had 
more than her share of physical vanity   &mdash;   not more than 
was her right, in view of her charms, but more than 
she could carry off well. With many a secret smile he 
had observed that she thought herself perfect 
physically. This did not repel him; it never does repel 
a man   &mdash;   when and so long as he is under the enchantment 
of the charms the woman more or less exaggerates. 
But, while he had often seen women with inordinate 
physical vanity, so often that he had come 
to regarding it as an essential part of feminine 
character, never before had he seen one so content with 
her own good opinion of herself that she was indifferent 
to appreciation from others. 
</p><p>He did not go back to the office after lunch. 
Several important matters were coming up; if he got within 
reach they might conspire to make it impossible for 
him to be with her on time. If his partners, his clients 
knew!  He the important man of affairs kneeling at 
the feet of a nobody!   &mdash;   and why?  Chiefly because he 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0251" n="230"/>  
was unable to convince her that he amounted to 
anything. His folly nauseated him. He sat in a corner 
in the dining room of the Lawyers' Club and drank 
one whisky and soda after another and brooded over 
his follies and his unhappiness, muttering monotonously 
from time to time:  &ldquo;No wonder she makes a fool of 
me. I invite it, I beg for it, damned idiot that I am!&rdquo; 
By three o'clock he had drunk enough liquor to have 
dispatched the average man for several days. It had 
produced no effect upon him beyond possibly a slight 
aggravation of his moodiness. 
</p><p>It took only twenty minutes to get from New York 
to her house. He set out at a few minutes after three; 
arrived at twenty minutes to four. As experience of 
her ways had taught him that she was much less friendly 
when he disobeyed her requests, he did not dare go to 
the house, but, after looking at it from a corner two 
blocks away, made a detour that would use up some 
of the time he had to waste. And as he wandered he 
indulged in his usual alternations between self-derision 
and passion. He appeared at the house at five minutes 
to four. Patrick, who with Molly his wife looked after 
the domestic affairs, was at the front gate gazing down 
the street in the direction from which he always came. 
At sight of him Pat came running. Norman quickened 
his pace, and every part of his nervous system was in 
turmoil. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Hallowell   &mdash;   he's   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">dead</hi>,&rdquo; 
gasped Pat. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0252" n="231"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo; echoed Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Three quarters of an hour ago, sir. He came 
from the lobatry, walked in the sitting room where Miss 
Dorothy was oiling the furniture and I was oiling the 
floor. And he sets down   &mdash;   and he looks at her   &mdash;   as cool 
and calm as could be   &mdash;   and he says, `Dorothy, my child, 
I'm dying.'  And she stands up straight and looks at 
him curious like   &mdash;   just curious like. And he says, 
`Dorothy, good-by.'  And he shivers, and I jumps up just 
in time to catch him from rolling to the floor. He 
was dead then   &mdash;   so the doctor says.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; repeated Norman, looking round vaguely. 
</p><p>He went on to the house, Pat walking beside him 
and chattering on and on   &mdash;   a stream of words Norman 
did not hear. As he entered the open front door Dorothy 
came down the stairs. He had thought he knew 
how white her skin was. But he did not know until 
then. And from that ghostly pallor looked the eyes of 
grief beyond tears. He advanced toward her. But she 
seemed to be wrapped in an atmosphere of aloofness. 
He felt himself a stranger and an alien. After a brief 
silence she said:  &ldquo;I don't realize it. I've been upstairs 
where Pat carried him   &mdash;   but I don't realize it. It simply 
can't be.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know what he wished to say to me?&rdquo; he 
asked. 
</p><p>&ldquo;No. I guess he felt this coming. Probably it 
came quicker than he expected. Now I can see that 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0253" n="232"/>  
he hasn't been well for several days. But he would 
never let anything about illness be said. He thought 
talking of those things made them worse.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You have relatives   &mdash;   somebody you wish me to telegraph?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She shook her head. &ldquo;No one. Our relatives out 
West are second cousins or further away. They care 
nothing about us. No, I'm all alone.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The tears sprang to his eyes. But there were no 
tears in her eyes, no forlornness in her voice. She was 
simply stating a fact. He said:  &ldquo;I'll look after 
everything. Don't give it a moment's thought.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No, I'll arrange,&rdquo; replied she. &ldquo;It'll give me 
something to do   &mdash;   something to do for him. You see, 
it's my last chance.&rdquo;  And she turned to ascend the 
stairs. &ldquo;Something to do,&rdquo; she repeated dully. &ldquo;I 
wish I hadn't cleaned house this morning. That would 
be something more to do.&rdquo; 
</p><p>This jarred on him   &mdash;   then brought the tears to his 
eyes again. How childish she was!   &mdash;   and how desolate! 
&ldquo;But you'll let me stay?&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;You'll need 
me. At any rate, I want to feel that you do.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'd rather you didn't stay,&rdquo; she said, in the same 
calm, remote way. &ldquo;I'd rather be alone with him, this 
last time. I'll go up and sit there until they take 
him away. And then   &mdash;   in a few days I'll see what to do 
   &mdash;   I'll send for you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I can't leave you at such a time,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0254" n="233"/>  
haven't realized yet. When you do you will need some 
one.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You don't understand,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;He 
and I understood each other in some ways. I know he'd 
not want   &mdash;   anyone round.&rdquo; 
</p><p>At her slight hesitation before &ldquo;anyone&rdquo; he winced. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I must be alone with him,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Thank 
you, but I want to go now.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not just yet,&rdquo; he begged. Then, seeing the 
shadow of annoyance on her beautiful white face, he 
rose and said:  &ldquo;I'm going. I only want to help you.&rdquo; 
He extended his hand impulsively, drew it back before 
she had the chance to refuse it. For he felt that she 
would refuse it. He said, &ldquo;You know you can rely 
on me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I don't need anybody,&rdquo; replied she. 
&ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;If I can do anything   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Pat will telephone.&rdquo;  She was already halfway 
upstairs. 
</p><p>He found Pat in the front yard, and arranged with 
him to get news and to send messages by way of the 
drug store at the corner, so that she would know nothing 
about it. He went to a florist's in New York and 
sent masses of flowers. And then   &mdash;   there was nothing 
more to do. He stopped in at the club and drank and 
gambled until far into the morning. He fretted gloomily 
about all the next day, riding alone in the Park, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0255" n="234"/>  
driving with his sister, drinking and gambling at the 
club again and smiling cynically to himself at the covert 
glances his acquaintances exchanged. He was growing 
used to those glances. He cared not the flip of a penny 
for them. 
</p><p>On the third day came the funeral, and he went. He 
did not let his cabman turn in behind the one carriage 
that followed the hearse. At the graveyard he stood 
afar off, watching her in her simple new black, noting 
her calm. She seemed thinner, but he thought it might 
be simply her black dress. He could see no change in 
her face. As she was leaving the grave, she looked in 
his direction but he was uncertain whether she had 
seen him. Pat and Molly were in the big, gloomy looking 
carriage with her. 
</p><p>He ventured to go to the front gate an hour later. 
Pat came out. &ldquo;It's no use to go in, Mr. Norman,&rdquo; 
he said. &ldquo;She'll not see you. She's shut up in her 
own room.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Hasn't she cried yet, Pat?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not yet. We're waiting for it, sir. We're afraid 
her mind will give way. At least, Molly is. I don't 
think so. She's a queer young lady   &mdash;   as queer as she 
looks   &mdash;   though at first you'd never think it. She's 
always looking different. I never seen so many persons 
in one.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Can't Molly <hi rend="italic">make</hi> her cry?   &mdash;   by 
talking about 
him?&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0256" n="235"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;She's tried, sir. It wasn't no use. Why, Miss 
Dorothy talks about him just as if he was still here.&rdquo; 
Pat wiped the sweat from his forehead. &ldquo;I've been in 
many a house of mourning, but never through such a 
strain as this. Somehow I feel as if I'd never before 
been round where there was anyone that'd lost somebody 
they <hi rend="italic">really</hi> cared about. Weeping and 
moaning 
don't amount to much beside what she's doing.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman stayed round for an hour or more, then 
rushed away distracted. He drank like a madman   &mdash;    
drank himself into a daze, and so got a few hours of 
a kind of sleep. He was looking haggard and wild 
now, and everyone avoided him, though in fact there 
was not the least danger of an outburst of temper. His 
sister   &mdash;   Josephine   &mdash;   the office   &mdash;   several clients telephoned 
for him. To all he sent the same refusal   &mdash;   that he was 
too ill to see anyone. Not until the third day after the 
funeral did Dorothy telephone for him. 
</p><p>He took an ice-cold bath, got himself together as 
well as he could, and reached the house in Jersey City 
about half past three in the afternoon. She came gliding 
into the room like a ghost, trailing a black neglig&eacute;e 
that made the whiteness of her skin startling. Her eye-lids were heavy and dark, but unreddened. She gazed 
at him with calm, clear melancholy, and his heart 
throbbed and ached for her. She seated herself, clasped 
her hands loosely in her lap, and said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've sent for you so that I could settle things up.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0257" n="236"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Your father's affairs?  Can't I do it better?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;He had arranged everything. There are only the 
papers   &mdash;   his notes   &mdash;   and he wrote out the addresses of 
the men they were to be sent to. No, I mean settle 
things up with you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You mustn't bother about that,&rdquo; said he. 
&ldquo;Besides, there's nothing to settle.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I shan't pretend I'm going to try to pay you 
back,&rdquo; she went on, as if he had not spoken. &ldquo;I never 
could do it. But you will get part at least by selling 
this furniture and the things at the laboratory.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Dorothy   &mdash;   please,&rdquo; he implored. &ldquo;Don't you 
understand you're to stay on here, just the same?  What 
sort of man do you think I am?  I did this for you, 
and you know it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But <hi rend="italic">I</hi> did it for my father,&rdquo; 
replied she, &ldquo;and 
he's gone.&rdquo;  She was resting her melancholy gaze upon 
him. &ldquo;I couldn't take anything from you. You didn't 
think I was that kind?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He was silent. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I cared nothing about the scandal   &mdash;   what people 
said   &mdash;   so long as I was doing it for him. . . . I'd have 
done <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> for him. Sometimes I 
thought you were 
going to compel me to do things I'd have hated to do. 
I hope I wronged you, but I feared you meant that.&rdquo; 
She sat thinking several minutes, sighed wearily. &ldquo;It's 
all over now. It doesn't matter. I needn't bother 
about it any more.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0258" n="237"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Dorothy, let's not talk of these things now,&rdquo; said 
Norman. &ldquo;There's no hurry. I want you to wait until 
you are calm and have thought everything over. Then 
I'm sure you'll see that you ought to stay on.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;How could I?&rdquo; she asked wonderingly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?  Am I demanding anything of you? 
You know I'm not   &mdash;   and that I never shall.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But there's no reason on earth why <hi rend="italic">you</hi> should 
support <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. I can work. Why 
shouldn't I?  And if 
I didn't, if I stayed on here, what sort of woman would 
I be?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He was unable to find an answer. He was trying 
not to see a look in her face   &mdash;   or was it in her soul, 
revealed through her eyes?   &mdash;   a look that made him think 
for the first time of a resemblance between her and her 
father. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You see yourself I've got to go. Any money I 
could earn wouldn't more than pay for a room and 
board somewhere.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You can let me advance you money while you   &mdash;   &rdquo; 
He hesitated, had an idea which he welcomed eagerly   &mdash;    
&ldquo;while you study for the stage. Yes, that's the sensible 
thing. You can learn to act. Then you will be able to 
make a decent living.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She slowly shook her head. &ldquo;I've no talent for it 
   &mdash;   and no liking. No, Mr. Norman, I must go back to 
work   &mdash;   and right away.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But at least wait until you've looked into the stage 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0259" n="238"/>  
business,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;You may find that you like it 
and that you have talent for it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I can't take any more from you,&rdquo; she said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You think I am not to be trusted. I'm not going 
to say now how I feel toward you. But I can honestly 
say one thing. Now that you are all alone and 
unprotected, you needn't have the least fear of me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She smiled faintly. &ldquo;I see you don't believe me. 
Well, it doesn't matter. I've seen Mr. Tetlow and he 
has given me a place at twelve a week in his office.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman sank back in his chair. &ldquo;He is in for 
himself now?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No. He's head clerk for Pitchley &amp; Culver.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Culver!&rdquo; exclaimed Norman. &ldquo;I don't want you 
to go into Culver's office. He's a scoundrel.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Again Dorothy smiled faintly. Norman colored. 
&ldquo;I know he stands well   &mdash;   as well as I do. But I can't 
trust you with him. That sounds ridiculous but   &mdash;   it's 
true.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I think I can trust myself,&rdquo; she said quietly. Her 
grave regard fixed his. &ldquo;Don't you?&rdquo; she asked. 
</p><p>His eyes lowered. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But   &mdash;   why 
shouldn't you come back with us?  I'll see that you get 
a much better position than Culver's giving you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Over her face crept one of those mysterious 
transformations that made her so bafflingly fascinating to 
him. Behind that worldly-wise, satirical mask was she 
mocking at him?  All she said was:  &ldquo;I couldn't work 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0260" n="239"/>  
there. I've settled it with Mr. Tetlow. I go to work 
to-morrow.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo; he cried, starting up. 
</p><p>&ldquo;And I've found a place to live. Pat and Molly; 
will take care of things for you here.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Dorothy!  You don't <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> 
this?  You're not 
going to break off?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I shan't see you again   &mdash;   except as we may meet 
by accident.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Do you realize what you're saying means to me?&rdquo; 
he cried. &ldquo;Don't you know how I love you?&rdquo;  He 
advanced toward her. She stood and waited passively, 
looking at him. &ldquo;Dorothy   &mdash;   my love   &mdash;   do you want 
to kill me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;When are you to be married?&rdquo; she asked quietly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You are playing with me!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You are 
tormenting me. What have I ever done that you should 
treat me this way?&rdquo;  He caught her unresisting hands 
and kissed them. &ldquo;Dear   &mdash;   my dear   &mdash;   don't you care for 
me at all?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said placidly. &ldquo;I've always told you 
so.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He seized her in his arms, kissed her with a frenzy 
that was savage, ferocious. &ldquo;You will drive me mad. 
You <hi rend="italic">have</hi> driven me mad!&rdquo; he muttered.  
And he added, 
unconscious that he was speaking his thoughts, so 
distracted was he:  &ldquo;You <hi rend="italic">must</hi> love 
me   &mdash;   you <hi rend="italic">must!</hi>  No 
woman has ever resisted me. You cannot.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She drew herself away from him, stood before him 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0261" n="240"/>  
like snow, like ice. &ldquo;One thing I have never told you. 
I'll tell you now,&rdquo; she said deliberately. &ldquo;I despise 
you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He fell back a step and the chill of her coldness 
seemed to be freezing the blood in his veins. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've always despised you,&rdquo; she went on, and he 
shivered before that contemptuous word   &mdash;   it seemed only 
the more contemptuous for her calmness. &ldquo;Sometimes 
I've despised you thoroughly   &mdash;   again only a little   &mdash;   but 
always that feeling.&rdquo; 
</p><p>For a moment he thought she had at last stung his 
pride into the semblance of haughtiness. He was able 
to look at her with mocking eyes and to say, &ldquo;I 
congratulate you on your cleverness in concealing your 
feelings.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn't my cleverness,&rdquo; she said wearily. &ldquo;It 
was your blindness. I never deceived you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No, you never have,&rdquo; he replied sincerely. 
&ldquo;Perhaps I deserve to be despised. Again, perhaps if you 
knew the world   &mdash;   the one I live in   &mdash;   better, you'd think 
less harshly of me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't think harshly of you. How could I   &mdash;    
after all you did for my father?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Dorothy, if you'll stay here and study for the 
stage   &mdash;   or anything you choose   &mdash;   I promise you I'll 
never speak of my feeling for you   &mdash;   or show it in any 
way   &mdash;   unless you yourself give me leave.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She smiled with childlike pathos. &ldquo;You ought not 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0262" n="241"/>  
to tempt me. Do you want me to keep on despising 
you?  Can't you ever be fair with me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>The sad, frank gentleness of the appeal swung his 
unhinged mind to the other extreme   &mdash;   from the savagery 
of passion to a frenzy of remorse. &ldquo;Fair to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>? 
No,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;because I love you. Oh, I'm ashamed 
   &mdash;   bitterly ashamed. I'm capable of any baseness to 
get you. You're right. You can't trust me. In going 
you're saving me from myself.&rdquo;  He hesitated, stared 
wildly, appalled at the words that were fighting for 
utterance   &mdash;   the words about marriage   &mdash;   about marrying 
her!  He said hoarsely:  &ldquo;I am mad   &mdash;   mad!  I don't 
know what I'm saying. Good-by   &mdash;     For God's sake, 
don't think the worst of me, Dorothy. Good-by. I 
<hi rend="italic">will</hi> be a man again   &mdash;   I will!&rdquo; 
</p><p>And he wrung her hand and, talking incoherently, 
he rushed from the room and from the house.</p>

<p>HE went straight home and sought his sister. She 
had that moment come in from tea after a matin&eacute;e. 
She talked about the play   &mdash;   how badly it was acted   &mdash;    
and about the women she had seen at tea   &mdash;   how badly 
dressed they were. &ldquo;It's hard to say which is the 
more dreadful   &mdash;   the ugly, misshapen human race without 
clothes or in the clothes it insists on wearing. And 
the talk at that tea! Does no one ever say a pleasant 
thing about anyone?  Doesn't anyone ever do a pleasant 
thing that can be spoken about?  I read this morning 
Tolstoy's advice about resolving to think all day only 
nice thoughts and sticking to it. That sounded good 
to me, and I decided to try it.&rdquo;  Ursula laughed and 
squirmed about in her tight-fitting dress that made an 
enchanting display of her figure. &ldquo;What is one to do? 
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> can't be a fraud, for one. And if I 
had stuck to my 
resolution I'd have spent the day in lying. What's 
the matter, Fred?&rdquo;  Now that her attention was 
attracted she observed more closely. &ldquo;What <hi rend="italic">have</hi> you 
been doing?  You look   &mdash;   frightful!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've broken with her,&rdquo; replied he. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0264" n="243"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;With Jo?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Why, Fred, you can't 
   &mdash;   you can't   &mdash;   with the wedding only five days away!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not with Jo.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Ursula breathed noisy relief. She said cheerfully: 
&ldquo;Oh   &mdash;   with the other. Well, I'm glad it's over.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Over?&rdquo; said he sardonically. &ldquo;Over?  It's only 
begun.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But you'll stick it out, Fred. You've made a fool 
of yourself long enough. What was the girl playing 
for?  Marriage?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He nodded. &ldquo;I guess so.&rdquo;  He laughed curtly. 
&ldquo;And she almost won.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Ursula smiled with fine mockery. &ldquo;Almost, but not 
quite. I know you men. Women do that sort of fool 
thing. But men   &mdash;   never   &mdash;   at least not the ambitious, 
snobbish New York men.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She almost won,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;At least, I 
almost did it. If I had stayed a minute longer I'd have 
done it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You like to think you would,&rdquo; mocked Ursula. 
&ldquo;But if you had tried to say the words your lungs 
would have collapsed, your vocal chords snapped and 
your tongue shriveled.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I am not so damn sure I shan't do it yet,&rdquo; he burst 
out fiercely. 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I am,&rdquo; said Ursula, calm, brisk, practical. 
&ldquo;What's she going to do?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Going to work.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0265" n="244"/>  
</p><p>Ursula laughed joyously. &ldquo;What a joke!  A woman 
go to work when she needn't!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She is going to work.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;To work another man.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She meant it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;How easily women fool men!   &mdash;   even the wise men 
like you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She meant it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She still hopes to marry you   &mdash;   or she has heard 
of your marriage   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman lifted his head. Into his face came the 
cynical, suspicious expression. 
</p><p>&ldquo;And has fastened on some other man. Or perhaps 
she's found some good provider who's willing to marry 
her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman sprang up, his eyes blazing, his mouth 
working cruelly. &ldquo;By God!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;If I thought 
that!&rdquo; 
</p><p>His sister was alarmed. Such a man   &mdash;   in such a 
delirium   &mdash;   might commit any absurdity. He flung himself 
down in despair. &ldquo;Urse, why can't I get rid of 
this thing?  It's ruining me. It's killing me!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Your good sense tells you if you had her you'd 
be over it   &mdash;   &rdquo;  She snapped her fingers   &mdash;   &ldquo;like that.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   yes   &mdash;   I know it!  But   &mdash;   &rdquo;  He groaned   &mdash;    
&ldquo;she has broken with me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Ursula went to him and kissed him and took his 
head in her arms. &ldquo;What a <hi rend="italic">boy</hi>-boy it 
is!&rdquo; she said 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0266" n="245"/>  
tenderly. &ldquo;Oh, it must be dreadful to have always 
had whatever one wanted and then to find something 
one can't have. We women are used to it   &mdash;   and the 
usual sort of man. But not your sort, Freddy   &mdash;   and 
I'm so sorry for you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I want her, Urse   &mdash;   I want her,&rdquo; he groaned, and 
he was almost sobbing. &ldquo;My God, I <hi rend="italic">can't</hi> get on 
without her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Now, Freddy dear, listen to me. You know she's 
'way, 'way beneath you   &mdash;   that she isn't at all what 
you've got in the habit of picturing her   &mdash;   that it's all 
delusion and nonsense   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I want her,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I want her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You'd be ashamed if you had her as a wife   &mdash;    
wouldn't you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He was silent. 
</p><p>&ldquo;She isn't a <hi rend="italic">lady</hi>.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; replied he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;She hasn't any sense. A low sort of cunning, 
yes. But not brains   &mdash;   not enough to hold you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;She's got enough for 
a woman. And   &mdash;   I <hi rend="italic">want</hi> her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She isn't to be compared with Josephine.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I don't want Josephine. I want <hi rend="italic">her</hi>.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But which do you want to <hi rend="italic">marry</hi>?   &mdash;   to bring 
forward as your wife?   &mdash;   to spend your life with?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I know. I'm a mad fool. But, Urse, I can't help 
it.&rdquo;  He stood up suddenly. &ldquo;I've used every weapon 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0267" n="246"/>  
I've got. Even pride   &mdash;   and it skulked away. My 
sense of humor   &mdash;   and it weakened. My will   &mdash;   and it 
snapped.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Is she so wonderful?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She is so   &mdash;   elusive. I can't understand her   &mdash;   I 
can't touch her. I can't find her. She keeps me going 
like a man chasing an echo.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Like a man chasing an echo,&rdquo; repeated Ursula 
reflectively. &ldquo;I understand. It is maddening. She must 
be clever   &mdash;   in her way.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Or very simple. God knows which; I don't   &mdash;   and 
sometimes I think she doesn't, either.&rdquo;  He made a 
gesture of dismissal. &ldquo;Well, it's finished. I must pull 
myself together   &mdash;   or try to.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You will,&rdquo; said his sister confidently. &ldquo;A 
fortnight from now you'll be laughing at yourself.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I am now. I have been all along. But   &mdash;   it does 
no good.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She had to go and dress. But she could not leave 
until she had tried to make him comfortable. He was 
drinking brandy and soda and staring at his feet which 
were stretched straight out toward the fire. &ldquo;Where's 
your sense of humor?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Throw yourself 
on your sense of humor. It's a friend that sticks 
when all others fail.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It's my only hope,&rdquo; he said with a grim smile. &ldquo;I 
can see myself. No wonder she despises me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Despises you?&rdquo; scoffed Ursula. &ldquo;A <hi rend="italic">woman</hi> despise 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0268" n="247"/>  
<hi rend="italic">you!</hi>  She's crazy about you, I'll 
bet anything you 
like. Before you're through with this you'll find out 
I'm right. And then   &mdash;   you'll have no use for her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She despises me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Well   &mdash;   what of it?  Really, Fred, it irritates me 
to see you absolutely unlike yourself. Why, you're as 
broken-spirited as a henpecked old husband.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Just that,&rdquo; he admitted, rising and looking drearily 
about. &ldquo;I don't know what the devil to do next. 
Everything seems to have stopped.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Going to see Josephine this evening?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; was his indifferent reply. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You'll have to dress after dinner. There's no 
time now.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Dress?&rdquo; he inquired vaguely. &ldquo;Why dress? 
Why do anything?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She thought he would not go to Josephine but 
would hide in his club and drink. But she was mistaken. 
Toward nine o'clock he, in evening dress, with the 
expression of a horse in a treadmill, rang the bell of 
Josephine's house and passed in at the big bronze doors. 
The butler must have particularly admired the way he 
tossed aside his coat and hat. As soon as he was in 
the presence of his fianc&eacute;e he saw that she was again in 
the throes of some violent agitation. 
</p><p>She began at once:  &ldquo;I've just had the most frightful 
scene with father,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He's been hearing 
a lot of stuff about you down town and it set him wild.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0269" n="248"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Do you mind if I smoke a cigar?&rdquo; said he, looking 
at her unseeingly with haggard, cold eyes. &ldquo;And 
may I have some whisky?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She rang. &ldquo;I hope the servants didn't hear him,&rdquo; 
she said. Then, as a step sounded outside she put on 
an air of gayety, as if she were still laughing at some 
jest he had made. In the doorway appeared her father 
one of those big men who win half the battle in 
advance on personal appearance of unconquerable might. 
Burroughs was noted for his generosity and for his 
violent temper. As a rule men of the largeness necessary 
to handling large affairs are free from petty vindictiveness. 
They are too busy for hatred. They do not 
forgive; they are most careful not to forget; they 
simply stand ready at any moment to do whatever it 
is to their interest to do, regardless of friendships or 
animosities. Burroughs was an exception in that he 
got his highest pleasure out of pursuing his enemies. 
He enjoyed this so keenly that several times   &mdash;   so it was 
said   &mdash;   he had sacrificed real money to satisfy a revenge. 
But these rumors may have wronged him. It is hardly 
probable that a man who would let a weakness carry 
him to that pitch of folly could have escaped destruction. 
For of all the follies revenge is the most dangerous   &mdash;    
as well as the most fatuous. 
</p><p>Burroughs had a big face. Had he looked less 
powerful the bigness of his features, the spread of cheek 
and jowl, would have been grotesque. As it was, the 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0270" n="249"/>  
face was impressive, especially when one recalled how 
many, many millions he owned and how many more he 
controlled. The control was better than the ownership. 
The millions he owned made him a coward   &mdash;   he was 
afraid he might lose them. The millions he controlled, 
and of course used for his own enrichment, made him 
brave, for if they were lost in the daring ventures in 
which he freely staked them, why, the loss was not his, 
and he could shift the blame. Usually Norman treated 
him with great respect, for his business gave the firm 
nearly half its total income, and it was his daughter and 
his wealth, prestige and power, that Norman was marrying. 
But this evening he looked at the great man 
with a superciliousness that was peculiarly disrespectful 
from so young a man to one well advanced toward 
old age. Norman had been feeling relaxed, languid, 
exhausted. The signs of battle in that powerful face 
nerved him, keyed him up at once. He waited with a 
joyful impatience while the servant was bringing cigars 
and whisky. The enormous quantities of liquor he had 
drunk in the last few days had not been without effect. 
Alcohol, the general stimulant, inevitably brings out 
in strong relief a man's dominant qualities. The 
dominant quality of Norman was love of combat. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Josephine tells me you are in a blue fury,&rdquo; said 
Norman pleasantly when the door was closed and the 
three were alone. &ldquo;No   &mdash;   not a blue fury. A black 
fury.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0271" n="250"/>  
</p><p>At the covert insolence of his tone Josephine became 
violently agitated. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, with the 
imperiousness of an only and indulged child, &ldquo;I have asked 
you not to interfere between Fred and me. I thought 
I had your promise.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I said I'd think about it,&rdquo; replied her father. He 
had a heavy voice that now and then awoke some string 
of the lower octaves of the piano in the corner to a 
dismal groan. &ldquo;I've decided to speak out.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's right, sir,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;Is your quarrel 
with me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Josephine attempted an easy laugh. &ldquo;It's that silly 
story we were talking about the other day, Fred.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I supposed so,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You are not smoking, 
Mr. Burroughs   &mdash;   &rdquo;  He laughed amiably   &mdash;   &ldquo;at least 
not a cigar.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;The doctor only allows me one, and I've had it,&rdquo; 
replied Burroughs, his eyes sparkling viciously at this 
flick of the whip. &ldquo;What is the truth about that business, 
Norman?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman's amused glance encountered the savage 
glare mockingly. &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo; he inquired. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Because my daughter's happiness is at stake. 
Because I cannot but resent a low scandal about a man 
who wishes to marry my daughter.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Very proper, sir,&rdquo; said Norman graciously. 
</p><p>&ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; continued Burroughs with accelerating  
anger, &ldquo;tells me you have denied the story.&rdquo;</p> 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0272"/> 
  <pb  entity="DSSR_000002243_0273"/>
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0274" n="251"/>  
<p>Norman interrupted with an astonished look at 
Josephine. She colored, gazed at him imploringly. His 
face terrified her. When body and mind are in health 
and at rest the fullness of the face hides the character 
to a great extent. But when a human being is sick or 
very tired the concealing roundness goes and in the 
clearly marked features the true character is revealed. 
In Norman's face, haggard by his wearing emotions, his 
character stood forth   &mdash;   the traits of strength, of 
tenacity, of inevitable purpose. And Josephine saw and 
dreaded. 
</p><p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Burroughs went on, &ldquo;I have it on the best 
authority that it is true.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman, looking into the fascinating face of danger, 
was thrilled. &ldquo;Then you wish to break off the engagement?&rdquo; 
he said in the gentlest, smoothest tone. 
</p><p>Burroughs brought his fist down on the table   &mdash;   and 
Norman recognized the gesture of the bluffer. &ldquo;I wish 
you to break off with that woman!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I 
insist upon it   &mdash;   upon positive assurances from you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Fred!&rdquo; pleaded Josephine. &ldquo;Don't listen to him. 
Remember, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have said nothing.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He had long been looking for a justifying grievance 
against her. It now seemed to him that he had 
found it. &ldquo;Why should you?&rdquo; he said genially but 
with subtle irony, &ldquo;since you are getting your father 
to speak for you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>There was just enough truth in this to entangle her 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0275" n="252"/>  
and throw her into disorder. She had been afraid of 
the consequences of her father's interfering with a man 
so spirited as Norman, but at the same time she had 
longed to have some one put a check upon him. Norman's 
suave remark made her feel that he could see into 
her inmost soul   &mdash;   could see the anger, the jealousy, the 
doubt, the hatred-tinged love, the love-saturated hate 
seething and warring there. 
</p><p>Burroughs was saying:  &ldquo;If we had not committed 
ourselves so deeply, I should deal very differently with 
this matter.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why should that deter you?&rdquo; said Norman   &mdash;   and 
Josephine gave a piteous gasp. &ldquo;If this goes much 
farther, I assure you <hi rend="italic">I</hi> shall not be 
deterred.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Burroughs, firmly planted in a big leather chair, 
looked at the young man in puzzled amazement. &ldquo;I 
see you think you have us in your power,&rdquo; he said at 
last. &ldquo;But you are mistaken.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; rejoined the young man, &ldquo;I 
see you believe you have me in your power. And in a 
sense you are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> mistaken.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Father, he is right,&rdquo; cried Josephine agitatedly. 
&ldquo;I shouldn't love and respect him as I do if he would 
submit to this hectoring.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Hectoring!&rdquo; exclaimed Burroughs. &ldquo;Josephine, 
leave the room. I cannot discuss this matter properly 
before you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I hope you will not leave, Josephine,&rdquo; said Norman. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0276" n="253"/>  
&ldquo;There is nothing to be said that you cannot 
and ought not to hear.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm not an infant, father,&rdquo; said Josephine. 
&ldquo;Besides, it is as Fred says. He has done nothing   &mdash;    
improper.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then why does he not say so?&rdquo; demanded 
Burroughs, seeing a chance to recede from his former too 
advanced position. &ldquo;That's all I ask.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I told you all about it, father,&rdquo; said Josephine 
angrily. &ldquo;They've been distorting the truth, and the 
truth is to his credit.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman avoided the glance she sent to him; it was 
only a glance and away, for more formidably than ever 
his power was enthroned in his haggard face. He 
stood with his back to the fire and it was plain that 
the muscles of his strong figure were braced to give 
and to receive a shock. &ldquo;Mr. Burroughs,&rdquo; he said, 
&ldquo;your daughter is mistaken. Perhaps it is my fault 
   &mdash;   in having helped her to mislead herself. The plain 
truth is, I have become infatuated with a young woman. 
She cares nothing about me   &mdash;   has repulsed me. I have 
been and am making a fool of myself about her. I've 
been hoping to cure myself. I still hope. But I am 
not cured.&rdquo; 
</p><p>There was absolute silence in the room. Norman 
stole a glance at Josephine. She was sitting erect, a 
greenish pallor over her ghastly face. 
</p><p>He said:  &ldquo;If she will take me, now that she knows 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0277" n="254"/>  
the truth, I shall be grateful   &mdash;   and I shall make what 
effort I can to do my best.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He looked at her and she at him. And for an 
instant her eyes softened. There was the appeal of weak 
human heart to weak human heart in his gaze. Her lip 
quivered. A brief struggle between vanity and love   &mdash;    
and vanity, the stronger, the strongest force in her life, 
dominating it since earliest babyhood and only seeming 
to give way to love when love came   &mdash;   it was vanity that 
won. She stiffened herself and her mouth curled with 
proud scorn. She laughed   &mdash;   a sneer of jealous rage. 
&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the lady in the case is a common 
typewriter in his office.&rdquo; 
</p><p>But to men   &mdash;   especially to practical men   &mdash;    
differences of rank and position among women are not 
fundamentally impressive. Man is in the habit of taking what 
he wants in the way of womankind wherever he finds it, 
and he understands that habit in other men. He was 
furious with Norman, but he did not sympathize with 
his daughter's extreme attitude. He said to Norman 
sharply: 
</p><p>&ldquo;You say you have broken with the woman?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She has broken with me,&rdquo; replied Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;At any rate, everything is broken off.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Apparently.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then there is no reason why the marriage should 
not go on.&rdquo;  He turned to his daughter. &ldquo;If you 
understood men, you would attach no importance to this 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0278" n="255"/>  
matter. As you yourself said, the woman isn't a lady 
   &mdash;   isn't in our class. That sort of thing amounts to 
nothing. Norman has acted well. He has shown the 
highest kind of honesty   &mdash;   has been truthful where most 
men would have shifted and lied. Anyhow, things have 
gone too far.&rdquo;  Not without the soundest reasons had 
Burroughs accepted Norman as his son-in-law; and he 
had no fancy for giving him up, when men of his 
pre&euml;minent fitness were so rare. 
</p><p>There was another profound silence. Josephine 
looked at Norman. Had he returned her gaze, the event 
might have been different; for within her there was 
now going on a struggle between two nearly evenly 
matched vanities   &mdash;   the vanity of her own outraged pride 
and the vanity of what the world would say and think, 
if the engagement were broken off at that time and in 
those circumstances. But he did not look at her. He 
kept his eyes fixed upon the opposite wall, and there 
was no sign of emotion of any kind in his stony 
features. Josephine rose, suppressed a sob, looked 
arrogant scorn from eyes shining with tears   &mdash;   tears of self-pity. &ldquo;Send him away, father,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He has 
tried to degrade <hi rend="italic">me!</hi>  I am done with 
him.&rdquo;  And she 
rushed from the room, her father half starting from 
his chair to detain her. 
</p><p>He turned angrily on Norman. &ldquo;A hell of a mess 
you've made!&rdquo; he cried. 
</p><p>&ldquo;A hell of a mess,&rdquo; replied the young man. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0279" n="256"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Of course she'll come round. But you've got to 
do your part.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It's settled,&rdquo; said Norman. And he threw his 
cigar into the fireplace. &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; cried Burroughs. &ldquo;Before you go, 
you must see Josie alone and talk with her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It would be useless,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;You know 
her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Burroughs laid his hand friendlily but heavily upon 
the young man's shoulder. &ldquo;This outburst of nonsense 
might cost you two young people your happiness 
for life. This is no time for jealousy and false pride. 
Wait a moment.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;But it is useless.&rdquo; 
He understood Josephine now   &mdash;   he who had become a 
connoisseur of love. He knew that her vanity-founded 
love had vanished. 
</p><p>Burroughs disappeared in the direction his daughter 
had taken. Norman waited several minutes   &mdash;   long 
enough slowly to smoke a cigarette. Then he went into 
the hall and put on his coat with deliberation. No one 
appeared, not even a servant. He went out into the 
street. 
</p><p>In the morning papers he found the announcement 
of the withdrawal of the invitations   &mdash;   and from half a 
column to several columns of comment, much of it 
extremely unflattering to him.</p>

<p>WHEN a &ldquo;high life&rdquo; engagement such as that of 
Norman and Miss Burroughs, collapses on the eve of 
the wedding, the gossip and the scandal, however great, 
are but a small part of the mess. Doubtless many a 
marriage   &mdash;   and not in high life alone, either   &mdash;   has been 
put through, although the one party or the other or 
both have discovered that disaster was inevitable   &mdash;   solely 
because of the appalling muddle the sensible course 
would precipitate. In the case of the Norman-Burroughs 
fiasco, there were   &mdash;   to note only a few big items 
   &mdash;   such difficulties as several car loads of presents from 
all parts of the earth to be returned, a house furnished 
throughout and equipped to the last scullery maid and 
stable boy to be disposed of, the entire Burroughs 
domestic economy which had been reconstructed to be 
put back upon its former basis. 
</p><p>It is not surprising that, as Ursula Fitzhugh was 
credibly informed, Josephine almost decided to send for 
Bob Culver and marry him on the day before the day 
appointed for her marriage to Fred. The reason given 
for her not doing this sounded plausible. Culver, 
despairing of making the match on which his ambition   &mdash;    
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0281" n="258"/>  
and therefore his heart was set   &mdash;   and seeing a chance to 
get suddenly rich, had embarked for a career as a blackmailer 
of corporations. That is, he nosed about for a 
big corporation stealthily doing or arranging to do 
some unlawful but highly profitable acts; he bought a 
few shares of its stock, using a fake client as a blind; he 
then proceeded to threaten it with exposure, expensive 
hindrances and the like, unless it bought him off at a 
huge profit to himself. This business was regarded as 
most disreputable and   &mdash;   thanks to the power of the big 
corporations over the courts   &mdash;   had resulted in the sending 
of several of its practisers to jail or on hasty journeys 
to foreign climes. But Culver, almost if not quite 
as good a lawyer as Norman, was too clever to be caught 
in that way. However, while he was getting very rich 
rapidly, he was as yet far from rich enough to overcome 
the detestation of old Burroughs, and to be eligible for 
the daughter. 
</p><p>So, Josephine sailed away to Europe, with the 
consolation that her father was so chagrined by the fizzle 
that he had withdrawn his veto upon the purchase of a 
foreign title   &mdash;   that veto having been the only reason she 
had looked at home for a husband. Strange indeed are 
the ways of love   &mdash;   never stranger than when it comes 
into contact with the vanities of wealth and social 
position and the other things that cause a human being to 
feel that he or she is lifted clear of and high above the 
human condition. Josephine had her consolation. For 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0282" n="259"/>  
Norman the only consolation was escape from a marriage 
which had become so irksome in anticipation that 
he did not dare think what it would be in the reality. 
Over against this consolation was set a long list of 
disasters. He found himself immediately shunned by all 
his friends. Their professed reason was that he had 
acted shabbily in the breaking of the engagement; for, 
while it was assumed that Josephine must have done the 
actual breaking, it was also assumed that he must have 
given her provocation and to spare. This virtuous 
indignation was in large part mere pretext, as virtuous 
indignation in frail mortals toward frail mortals is apt 
to be. The real reason for shying off from Norman was 
his atmosphere of impending downfall. And certainly 
that atmosphere had eaten away and dissipated all his 
former charm. He looked dull and boresome   &mdash;   and he 
was. 
</p><p>But the chief disaster was material. As has been 
said, old Burroughs, in his own person and in the enterprises 
he controlled, gave Norman's firm about half its 
income. The day Josephine sailed, Lockyer, senior 
partner of the firm, got an intimation that unless Norman 
left, Burroughs would take his law business elsewhere, 
and would &ldquo;advise&rdquo; others of their clients to 
follow his example. Lockyer no sooner heard than he 
began to bestir himself. He called into consultation the 
learned Benchley and the astute Sanders and the soft 
and sly Lockyer junior. There could be no question 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0283" n="260"/>  
that Norman must be got rid of. The only point was, 
who should inform the lion that he had been deposed? 
</p><p>After several hours of anxious discussion, Lockyer, 
his inward perturbations hid beneath that mask of smug 
and statesmanlike respectability, entered the lion's den 
   &mdash;   a sick lion, sick unto death probably, but not a dead 
lion. &ldquo;When you're ready to go uptown, Frederick,&rdquo; 
said he in his gentlest, most patriarchal manner, &ldquo;let me 
know. I want to have a little talk with you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman, heavy eyed and listless, looked at the handsome 
old fraud. As he looked something of the piercing 
quality and something of the humorous came back into 
his eyes. &ldquo;Sit down and say it now,&rdquo; said he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'd prefer to talk where we can be quiet.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman rang his bell and when an office boy 
appeared, said  &ldquo;No one is to disturb me until I ring 
again.&rdquo;  Then as the boy withdrew he said to Lockyer: 
&ldquo;Now, sir, what is it?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Lockyer strolled to the window, looked out as if 
searching for something he failed to find, came back to 
the chair on the opposite side of the desk from Norman, 
seated himself. &ldquo;I don't know how to begin,&rdquo; said he. 
&ldquo;It is hard to say painful things to anyone I have such 
an affection for as I have for you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman pushed a sheet of letter paper across the 
desk toward his partner. &ldquo;Perhaps that will help you,&rdquo; 
observed he carelessly. 
</p><p>Lockyer put on his nose glasses with the gesture of 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0284" n="261"/>  
grace and intellect that was famous. He read   &mdash;   a brief 
demand for a release from the partnership and a request 
for an immediate settlement. Lockyer blinked off his 
glasses with the gesture that was as famous and as 
admiringly imitated by lesser legal lights as was his gesture 
of be-spectacling himself. &ldquo;This is most astounding, 
my boy,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is most   &mdash;   most   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Gratifying?&rdquo; suggested Norman with a sardonic 
grin. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not in the least, Frederick. The very reverse   &mdash;    
the exact reverse.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman gave a shrug that said &ldquo;Why do you persist 
in those frauds   &mdash;   and with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>?&rdquo;  But 
he did not 
speak. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; pursued Lockyer, &ldquo;that you would not 
have taken this step without conclusive reasons. And 
I shall not venture the impertinence of prying or of 
urging.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Norman drily. &ldquo;Now, as to the 
terms of settlement.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Lockyer, from observation and from gossip, had a 
pretty shrewd notion of the state of his young partner's 
mind, and drew the not unwarranted conclusion that he 
would be indifferent about terms   &mdash;   would be &ldquo;easy.&rdquo; 
With the suavity of Mr. Great-and-Good-Heart he said: 
&ldquo;My dear boy, there can't be any question of money 
with us. We'll do the generously fair thing   &mdash;   for, we're 
not hucksterers but gentlemen.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0285" n="262"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds terrifying,&rdquo; observed the young man, 
with a faint ironic smile. &ldquo;I feel my shirt going and 
the cold winds whistling about my bare body. To save 
time, let <hi rend="italic">me</hi> state the terms. You 
want to be rid of me. 
I want to go. It's a whim with me. It's a necessity for 
you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Lockyer shifted uneasily at these evidences of 
unimpaired mentality and undaunted spirit. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Here are my terms,&rdquo; proceeded Norman. &ldquo;You 
are to pay me forty thousand a year for five years   &mdash;    
unless I open an office or join another firm. In that 
case, payments are to cease from the date of my reentering  
practice.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Lockyer leaned back and laughed benignantly. &ldquo;My 
dear Norman,&rdquo; he said with a gently remonstrant shake 
of the head, &ldquo;those terms are impossible. Forty thousand 
a year!  Why that is within ten thousand of the 
present share of any of us but you. It is the income of 
nearly three quarters of a million at six per cent   &mdash;   of 
a million at four per cent!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Norman, settling back in his 
chair. &ldquo;Then I stand pat.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Now, my dear Norman, permit me to propose 
terms that are fair to all   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;When I said I stood pat I meant that I would 
stay on.&rdquo;  His eyes laughed at Lockyer. &ldquo;I guess we 
can live without Burroughs and his dependents. Maybe 
they will find they can't live without us.&rdquo;  He slowly 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0286" n="263"/>  
leaned forward until, with his forearms against the edge 
of his desk, he was concentrating a memorable gaze upon 
Lockyer. &ldquo;Mr. Lockyer,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have been 
exercising my privilege as a free man to make a damn fool 
of myself. I shall continue to exercise it so long as I 
feel disposed that way. But let me tell you something. 
I can afford to do it. If a man's asset is money, or 
character or position or relatives and friends or popular 
favor or any other perishable article, he must take care 
how he trifles with it. He may find himself irretrievably 
ruined. But my asset happens to be none of those 
things. It is one that can be lost or damaged only by 
insanity or death. Do you follow me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>The old man looked at him with the sincere and most 
flattering tribute of compelled admiration. &ldquo;What a 
mind you've got, Frederick   &mdash;   and what courage!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You accept my terms?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;If the others agree   &mdash;   and I think they will.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;They will,&rdquo; said Norman. 
</p><p>The old man was regarding him with eyes that had 
genuine anxiety in them. &ldquo;Why <hi rend="italic">do</hi> you 
do it, Fred?&rdquo; 
he said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Because I wish to be free,&rdquo; replied Norman. He 
would never have told the full truth to that incredulous 
old cynic of a time-server   &mdash;   the truth that he was resigning 
at the dictation of a pride which forbade him to 
involve others in the ruin he, in his madness, was bent 
upon. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0287" n="264"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't mean, why do you resign,&rdquo; said Lockyer. 
&ldquo;I mean the other   &mdash;   the   &mdash;   woman.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman laughed harshly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've seen too much of the world not to understand,&rdquo; 
continued Lockyer. &ldquo;The measureless power 
of woman over man   &mdash;   especially   &mdash;   pardon me, my dear 
Norman   &mdash;   especially a bad woman!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;The measureless power of a man's imagination 
over himself,&rdquo; rejoined Norman. &ldquo;Did you ever see 
or hear of a man without imagination being upset by 
a woman?  It's in here, Mr. Lockyer&rdquo;   &mdash;   he rapped his 
forehead   &mdash;   &ldquo;altogether in here.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You realize that. Yet you go on   &mdash;   and for such a 
   &mdash;   pardon me, my boy, for saying it   &mdash;   for such a trifling 
object.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What does `trifling' mean, sir?&rdquo; replied the 
young man. &ldquo;What is trifling and what is important? 
It depends upon the point of view. What I want   &mdash;    
that is vital. What I do not want   &mdash;   that is paltry. 
It's my nature to go for what I happen to want   &mdash;   to 
go for it with all there is in me. I will take nothing 
else   &mdash;   nothing else.&rdquo; 
</p><p>There was in his eyes the glitter called insanity   &mdash;    
the glitter that reflects the state of mind of any strong 
man when possessed of one of those fixed ideas that are 
the idiosyncrasy of the strong. It would have been 
impossible for Lockyer to be possessed in that way; he 
had not the courage nor the concentration nor the independence 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0288" n="265"/>  
of soul; like most men, even able men, he 
dealt only in the conventional. Not in his wildest youth 
could he have wrecked or injured himself for a woman; 
women, for him, occupied their conventional place in the 
scheme of things, and had no allure beyond the 
conventionally proper and the conventionally improper   &mdash;    
for, be it remembered, vice has its beaten track no less 
than virtue and most of the vicious are as tame and 
unimaginative as the plodders in the high roads of 
propriety. Still, Lockyer had associated with strong men, 
men of boundless desires; thus, he could in a measure 
sympathize with his young associate. What a pity that 
these splendid powers should be perverted from the 
ordinary desires of strong men! 
</p><p>Norman rose, to end the interview. &ldquo;My address is 
my house. They will forward   &mdash;   if I go away.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Lockyer gave him a hearty handclasp, made a few 
phrases about good wishes and the like, left him alone. 
The general opinion was that Norman was done for. 
But Lockyer could not see it. He had seen too many 
men fall only to rise out of lowest depths to greater 
heights than they had fallen from. And Norman was 
only thirty-seven. Perhaps this would prove to be 
merely a dip in a securely brilliant career and not a fall 
at all. In that case   &mdash;   with such a brain, such a genius 
for the lawlessness of the law, what a laughing on the 
other side of the mouth there might yet be among young 
Norman's enemies   &mdash;   and friends! 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0289" n="266"/>  
</p><p>He spent most of the next few days   &mdash;   the lunch time, 
the late afternoon, finally the early morning hours   &mdash;    
lurking about the Equitable Building, in which were the 
offices of Pytchley and Culver. As that building had 
entrances on four streets, the best he could do was to 
walk round and round, with an occasional excursion 
through the corridors and past the elevators. He had 
written her, asking to see her; he had got no answer. 
He ceased to wait at the elevators after he had twice 
narrowly escaped being seen by Tetlow. He was 
indifferent to Tetlow, except as meeting him might make 
it harder to see Dorothy. He drank hard. But drink 
never affected him except to make him more grimly 
tenacious in whatever he had deliberately and soberly 
resolved. Drink did not explain   &mdash;   neither wholly nor in 
any part   &mdash;   this conduct of his. It, and the more erratic 
vagaries to follow, will seem incredible conduct for a man 
of Norman's character and position to feeble folk with 
their feeble desires, their dread of criticism and ridicule, 
their exaggerated and adoring notions of the master 
men. In fact, it was the natural outcome of the man's 
nature   &mdash;   arrogant, contemptuous of his fellowmen and 
of their opinions, and, like all the master men, capable 
of such concentration upon a desire that he would adopt 
any means, high or low, dignified or the reverse, if only 
it promised to further his end. Fred Norman, at these 
vulgar vigils, took the measure of his own self-abasement 
to a hair's breadth. But he kept on, with the fever of 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0290" n="267"/>  
his infatuation burning like a delirium, burning higher 
and deeper with each baffled day. 
</p><p>At noon, one day, as he swung into Broadway from 
Cedar street, he ran straight into Tetlow. It was 
raining and his umbrella caught in Tetlow's. It was a 
ludicrous situation, but there was no answering smile in 
his former friend's eyes. Tetlow glowered. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've heard you were hanging about,&rdquo; he said. 
&ldquo;How low you have sunk!&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman laughed in his face. &ldquo;Poor Tetlow,&rdquo; he 
said. &ldquo;I never expected to see you develop into a 
crusader. And what a Don Quixote you look. Cheer up, 
old man. Don't take it so hard.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I warn you to keep away from her,&rdquo; said Tetlow 
in subdued, tense tones, his fat face quivering with 
emotion. &ldquo;Hasn't she shown you plainly that she'll have 
nothing to do with you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I want only five minutes' talk with her, Tetlow,&rdquo; 
said Norman, dropping into an almost pleading tone. 
&ldquo;And I guarantee I'll say nothing you wouldn't 
approve, if you heard. You are advising her badly. You 
are doing her an injury.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I am protecting her from a scoundrel,&rdquo; retorted 
Tetlow. 
</p><p>&ldquo;She'll not thank you for it, when she finds out the 
truth.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You can write to her. What a shallow liar you 
are!&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0291" n="268"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot write what I must say,&rdquo; said Norman. It 
had never been difficult for him, however provoked, to 
keep his temper   &mdash;   outwardly. Tetlow's insults were to 
him no more than the barkings of a watch dog, and 
one not at all dangerous, but only amusing. &ldquo;I must 
see her. If you are her friend, and not merely a jealous, 
disappointed lover, you'll advise her to see me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You shall not see her, if I can help it,&rdquo; cried his 
former friend. &ldquo;And if you persist in annoying 
her   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't make futile threats, Tetlow,&rdquo; Norman 
interrupted. &ldquo;You've done me all the mischief you can do. 
I see you hate me for the injuries you've done me. That's 
the way it always is. But I don't hate you. It was at 
my suggestion that the Lockyer firm is trying to get 
you back as a partner.&rdquo;  Then, as Tetlow colored   &mdash;    
&ldquo;Oh, I see you're accepting their offer.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;If I had thought   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Nonsense. You're not a fool. How does it matter 
whose the hand, if only it's a helping hand?  And you 
may be sure they'd never have made you the offer if they 
didn't need you badly. All the credit I claim is having 
the intelligence to enlighten their stupidity with the 
right suggestion.&rdquo; 
</p><p>In spite of himself Tetlow was falling under the spell 
of Norman's personality, of the old and deep admiration 
the lesser man had for the greater. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Norman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how can you be such a combination 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0292" n="269"/>  
of bigness and petty deviltry?  You are a 
monster of self-indulgence. It's a God's mercy there 
aren't more men with your selfishness and your desires.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman laughed sardonically. &ldquo;The difference 
between me and most men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;isn't in selfishness 
or in desires, but in courage. Courage, Billy   &mdash;   there's 
what most of you lack. And even in courage I'm not 
alone. My sort fill most of the high places.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow looked dismal confession of a fear that Norman 
was right. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; pursued Norman, &ldquo;in this country there are 
enough wolves to attend to pretty nearly all the sheep   &mdash;    
though it's amazing how much mutton there is.&rdquo;  With 
an abrupt shift from raillery, &ldquo;You'll help me with her, 
Billy?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why don't you let her alone, Fred?&rdquo; pleaded 
Tetlow. &ldquo;It isn't worthy of you   &mdash;   a big man like you. Let 
her alone, Fred!   &mdash;   the poor child, trying to earn her own 
living in an honest way.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Let her alone?  Tetlow, I shall never let her alone 
   &mdash;   as long as she and I are both alive.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The fat man, with his premature wrinkles and his 
solemn air of law books that look venerable though fresh 
from the press, took on an added pastiness. &ldquo;Fred   &mdash;   for 
God's sake, can't you love her in a noble way   &mdash;   a way 
worthy of you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman gave him a penetrating glance. &ldquo;Is love   &mdash;    
such love as mine   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">and</hi> yours   &mdash;   &rdquo;  
There Tetlow flushed 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0293" n="270"/>  
guiltily   &mdash;   &ldquo;is it ever noble?   &mdash;   whatever that means. No, 
it's human   &mdash;   human. But I'm not trying to harm her. 
I give you my word. . . . Will you help me   &mdash;   and her?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow hesitated. His heavy cheeks quivered. &ldquo;I 
don't trust you,&rdquo; he cried violently   &mdash;   the violence of a 
man fighting against an enemy within. &ldquo;Don't ever 
speak to me again.&rdquo;  And he rushed away through the 
rain, knocking umbrellas this way and that. 
</p><p>About noon two days later, as Norman was making 
one of his excursions past the Equitable elevators, he 
saw Bob Culver at the news stand. It so happened that 
as he recognized Culver, Culver cast in the direction of 
the elevators the sort of look that betrays a man waiting 
for a woman. Unseen by Culver, Norman stopped short. 
Into his face blazed the fury of suspicion, jealousy, and 
hate   &mdash;   one of the cyclones of passion that swept him 
from time to time and revealed to his own appalled self 
the full intensity of his feeling, the full power of the 
demon that possessed him. Culver was of those glossy, 
black men who are beloved of women. He was much 
handsomer than Norman, who, indeed, was not handsome 
at all, but was regarded as handsome because he had 
the air of great distinction. Many times these two 
young men had been pitted against each other in legal 
battles. Every time Norman had won. Twice they had 
contended for the favor of the same lady. Each had 
scored once. But as Culver's victory was merely for a 
very light and empty-headed lady of the stage while he 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0294" n="271"/>  
had won Josephine Burroughs away from Culver, the 
balance was certainly not against him. 
</p><p>As Norman slipped back and into the cross corridor 
to avoid meeting Culver, Dorothy Hallowell hurried from 
a just descended elevator and, with a quick, frightened 
glance toward Culver, in profile, almost ran toward 
Norman. It was evident that she had only one thought 
   &mdash;   to escape being seen by her new employer. When she 
realized that some one was standing before her and 
moved to one side to pass, she looked up. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she 
gasped, starting back. And then she stood there white 
and shaking. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Is that beast Culver hounding you?&rdquo; demanded 
Norman. 
</p><p>She recovered herself quickly. With flashing eyes, 
she cried:  &ldquo;How dare you!  How dare you!&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman, possessed by his rage against Culver, paid 
no attention. &ldquo;If he don't let you alone,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'll 
thrash him into a hospital for six months. You must 
leave his office at once. You'll not go back there.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You must be crazy,&rdquo; replied she, calm again. 
&ldquo;I've no complaint to make of the way I'm being 
treated. I never was so well off in my life. And Mr. 
Culver is very kind and polite.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You know what that means,&rdquo; said Norman harshly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone isn't like you,&rdquo; retorted she. 
</p><p>He was examining her from head to foot, as if to 
make sure that it was she with no charm missing. He 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0295" n="272"/>  
noted that she was much less poorly dressed than when 
she worked for his firm. In those days she often looked 
dowdy, showed plainly the girl who has to make a hasty 
toilet in a small bedroom, with tiny wash-stand and 
looking-glass, in the early, coldest hours of a cold morning. 
Now she looked well taken care of physically, not 
so well, not anything like so well as the women uptown   &mdash;    
the ladies with nothing to do but make toilettes; still, 
unusually well looked after for a working girl. At first 
glance after those famished and ravening days of longing 
for her and seeking her, she before him in rather 
dim reality of the obvious office-girl, seemed disappointing. 
It could not be that this insignificance was the 
cause of all his fever and turmoil. He began to hope 
that he was recovering, that the cloud of insane desire 
was clearing from his sky. But a second glance killed 
that hope. For, once more he saw her mystery, her 
beauties that revealed their perfection and splendor only 
to the observant. 
</p><p>While he looked she was regaining her balance, as 
the fading color in her white skin and the subsidence 
of the excitement in her eyes evidenced. &ldquo;Let me pass, 
please,&rdquo; she said coldly   &mdash;   for, she was against the wall 
with him standing before her in such a way that she 
could not go until he moved aside. 
</p><p>&ldquo;We'll lunch together,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want to talk 
with you. Did that well-meaning ass   &mdash;   Tetlow   &mdash;   tell 
you?&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0296" n="273"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;There is nothing you can say that I wish to hear,&rdquo; 
was her quiet reply. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Your eyes   &mdash;   the edges of the lids are red. You have 
been crying?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She lifted her glance to his and he had the sense of a 
veil drawing aside to reveal a desolation. &ldquo;For my 
father,&rdquo; she said. 
</p><p>His face flushed. He looked steadily at her. &ldquo;Now 
that he is gone, you have no one to protect you. I 
am   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I need no one,&rdquo; said she with a faintly contemptuous 
smile. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You do need some one   &mdash;   and I am going to undertake it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her face lighted up. He thought it was because of 
what he had said. But she immediately undeceived him. 
She said in a tone of delighted relief, &ldquo;Here comes Mr. 
Tetlow. You must excuse me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Dorothy   &mdash;   listen!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We are going to 
be married at once.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The words exploded dizzily in his ears. He assumed 
they would have a far more powerful effect upon her. 
But her expression did not change. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said 
hastily. &ldquo;I must go with Mr. Tetlow.&rdquo;  Tetlow was 
now at hand, his heavy face almost formidable in its dark 
ferocity. She said to him:  &ldquo;I was waiting for you. 
Come on&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman turned eagerly to his former friend. He 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0297" n="274"/>  
said:  &ldquo;Tetlow, I have just asked Miss Hallowell to be 
my wife.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow stared. Then pain and despair seemed to 
flood and ravage his whole body. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I told you the other day,&rdquo; Norman went on, &ldquo;that 
I was ready to do the fair thing. I have just been 
saying to Miss Hallowell that she must have some one to 
protect her. You agree with me, don't you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow, fumbling vaguely with his watch chain, 
gazed straight ahead. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said with an effort. 
&ldquo;Yes, you are right, Norman. An office is no place for 
an attractive girl as young as she is.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Has Culver been annoying her?&rdquo; inquired Norman. 
</p><p>Tetlow started. &ldquo;Ah   &mdash;   she's told you   &mdash;   has she?  I 
rather hoped she hadn't noticed or understood.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Both men now looked at the girl. She had shrunk 
into herself until she was almost as dim and unimpressive, 
as cipher-like as when Norman first beheld her. Also 
she seemed at least five years less than her twenty. 
&ldquo;Dorothy,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;you will let me take care of 
you   &mdash;   won't you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said   &mdash;   and the word carried all the quiet 
force she was somehow able to put into her short, direct 
answers. 
</p><p>Tetlow's pasty sallowness took on a dark red tinge. 
He looked at her in surprise. &ldquo;You don't understand, 
Miss Dorothy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He wants to marry you.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0298" n="275"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;I understand perfectly,&rdquo; replied she, with the far-away look in her blue eyes. &ldquo;But I'll not marry him. 
I despise him. He frightens me. He sickens me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman clinched his hands and the muscles of his 
jaw in the effort to control himself. &ldquo;Dorothy,&rdquo; he 
said, &ldquo;I've not acted as I should. Tetlow will tell you 
that there is good excuse for me. I know you don't 
understand about those things   &mdash;   about the ways of the 
world   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I understand perfectly,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;It's 
you that don't understand. I never saw anyone so 
conceited. Haven't I told you I don't love you, and don't 
want anything to do with you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow, lover though he was   &mdash;   or perhaps because he 
was lover, of the hopeless kind that loves generously   &mdash;    
could not refrain from protest. The girl was flinging 
away a dazzling future. It wasn't fair to her to let her 
do it when if she appreciated she would be overwhelmed 
with joy and gratitude. &ldquo;I believe you ought to listen 
to Norman, Miss Dorothy,&rdquo; he said pleadingly. &ldquo;At 
any rate, think it over   &mdash;   don't answer right away. He 
is making you an honorable proposal   &mdash;   one that's 
advantageous in every way   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>Dorothy regarded him with innocent eyes, wide and 
wondering. &ldquo;I didn't think you could talk like that, 
Mr. Tetlow!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You heard what I said 
to him   &mdash;   about the way I felt. How could I be his wife? 
He tried everything else   &mdash;   and, now, though he's ashamed 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0299" n="276"/>  
of it, he's trying to get me by marriage. Oh, I understand. 
I wish I didn't. I'd not feel so low.&rdquo;  She looked 
at Norman. &ldquo;Can't you realize <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> 
that I don't want 
any of the grand things you're so crazy about   &mdash;   that I 
want something very different   &mdash;   something you could 
never give me   &mdash;   or get for me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Isn't there anything I can do, Dorothy, to make 
you forget and forgive?&rdquo; he cried, like a boy, an 
infatuated boy. &ldquo;For God's sake, Tetlow, help me!  Tell 
her I'm not so rotten as she thinks. I'll be anything you 
like, my darling   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">anything</hi>   &mdash;   if only 
you'll take me. 
For I must have you. You're the only thing in the 
world I care for   &mdash;   and, without you, I've no interest in 
life   &mdash;   none   &mdash;   none!&rdquo; 
</p><p>He was so impassioned that passersby began to 
observe them curiously. Tetlow became uneasy. But 
Norman and Dorothy were unconscious of what was going 
on around them. The energy of his passion compelled 
her, though the passion itself was unwelcome. 
&ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;Though you would have 
hurt me, if you could, I don't want to hurt you. . . . 
I'm sorry. I can't love you. . . . I'm sorry. Come on, 
Mr. Tetlow.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman stood aside. She and Tetlow went on out of 
the building. He remained in the same place, oblivious 
of the crowd streaming by, each man or woman with a 
glance at his vacant stare.</p>

<p>THAN Fred Norman no man ever had better reason 
to feel securely entrenched upon the heights of success. 
It was no silly vaunt of optimism for him to tell Lockyer 
that only loss of life or loss of mind could dislodge 
him. And a few days after Dorothy had extinguished 
the last spark of hope he got ready to pull himself 
together and show the world that it was indulging too 
soon in its hypocritical headshakings over his ruin. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I am going to open an office of my own at once,&rdquo; 
he said to his sister. 
</p><p>She did not wish to discourage him, but she could 
not altogether keep her thoughts from her face. She 
had, in a general way, a clear idea of the complete 
system of tollgates, duly equipped with strong barriers, 
which the mighty few have established across practically 
all the highroads to material success. Also, she 
felt in her brother's manner and tone a certain profound 
discouragement, a lack of the unconquerable 
spirit which had carried him so far so speedily. It is 
not a baseless notion that the man who has never been 
beaten is often destroyed by his first reverse. Ursula 
feared the spell of success had been broken for him. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0301" n="278"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; she suggested, with apparent carelessness, 
&ldquo;that you will give up your forty thousand a 
year?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He made a disdainful gesture. &ldquo;I can make more 
than that,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It's a second rate lawyer who 
can't in this day.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you can,&rdquo; replied she tactfully. &ldquo;But 
why not take a rest first?  Then there's old Burroughs 
   &mdash;   on the war path. Wouldn't it be wise to wait till 
he calms down?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;If Burroughs or any other man is necessary to 
me,&rdquo; rejoined Fred, &ldquo;the sooner I find it out the better. 
I ought to know just where I   &mdash;   I myself   &mdash;   stand.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No one is necessary to you but yourself,&rdquo; said 
Ursula, proudly and sincerely. &ldquo;But, Fred   &mdash;     Are 
you yourself just now?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No, I'm not,&rdquo; admitted he. &ldquo;But the way to 
become so again isn't by waiting but by working.&rdquo;  An 
expression of sheer wretchedness came into his listless, 
heavy eyes. &ldquo;Urse, I've got to conquer my weakness 
now, or go under.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was eager to hold on to the secure forty 
thousand a year   &mdash;   for his sake no less than for her own. 
She argued with him with all the adroitness of a mind 
as good in its way as his own. But she could not shake 
his resolution. And she in prudence, desisted when he 
said bitterly:  &ldquo;I see you've lost confidence in me. 
Well, I don't blame you. . . . So have I.&rdquo;  Then after 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0302" n="279"/>  
a moment, violently rather than strongly:  &ldquo;But I've 
got to get it back. If I don't I'm only putting off the 
smash   &mdash;   a complete smash.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't see quite how it's to be arranged,&rdquo; said 
she, red and hesitating. For, she feared he would 
think her altogether selfish in her anxiety. He 
certainly would have been justified in so thinking; he knew 
how rarely generosity survived in the woman who leads 
the soft and idle life. 
</p><p>&ldquo;How long can we keep on as we're living now   &mdash;    
if there's nothing, or little, coming in?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; confessed she. She was as poor at 
finance as he, and had certainly not been improved by 
his habit of giving her whatever she happened to think 
was necessary. &ldquo;I can't say. Perhaps a few months   &mdash;    
I don't know   &mdash;     Not long, I'm afraid.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Six months?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no. You see   &mdash;   the fact is   &mdash;   I've been rather 
careless about the bills. You're so generous, Fred   &mdash;    
and one is so busy in New York. I guess we owe a 
good deal   &mdash;   here and there and yonder. And   &mdash;   the last 
few days some of the tradespeople have been pressing 
for payment.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You see!&rdquo; exclaimed he. &ldquo;The report is going 
round that I'm ruined and done for. I've simply got 
to make good. If you can't keep up a front, shut up 
the house and go abroad. You can stay till I've got 
my foot back on its neck.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0303" n="280"/>  
</p><p>She believed in him, at bottom. She could not 
conceive how appearances and her forebodings could be 
true. Such strength as his could not be overwhelmed 
thus suddenly. And by so slight a thing!   &mdash;   by an 
unsatisfied passion for a woman, and an insignificant 
woman, at that. For, like all women, like all the world 
for that matter, she measured a passion by the woman 
who was the object of it, instead of by the man who 
fabricated it. &ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   I'll go abroad,&rdquo; said she, 
hopefully. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Quietly arrange for a long stay,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;I 
<hi rend="italic">hope</hi> it won't be long. But I never 
plan on hope.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Thus, with his sister and Fitzhugh out of the way 
and the heaviest of his burdens of expense greatly 
lightened, he set about rehabitating himself. He took an 
office, waited for clients. And clients came   &mdash;   excellent 
clients. Came and precipitately left him. 
</p><p>There were two reasons for it. The first   &mdash;   the one 
most often heard   &mdash;   was the story going round that he 
had been, and probably still was, out of his mind. No 
deadlier or crueler weapon can be used against a man 
than that same charge as to his sanity. It has been 
known to destroy, or seriously maim, brilliant and able 
men with no trace of any of the untrustworthy kinds of 
insanity. Where the man's own conduct gives color to 
the report, the attack is usually mortal. And Norman 
had acted the crazy man. The second reason was the 
hostility of Burroughs, reinforced by all the hatreds 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0304" n="281"/>  
and jealousies Norman's not too respectful way of 
dealing with his fellow men had been creating through 
fifteen years. 
</p><p>The worst moment in the life of a man who has 
always proudly regarded himself as above any need 
whatever from his fellow men is when he discovers all 
in a flash, that the timid animal he spurned as it fawned 
has him upon his back, has its teeth and claws at his 
helpless throat. 
</p><p>For four months he stood out against the isolation, 
the suspicion as to his sanity, the patronizing pity of 
men who but a little while before had felt honored when 
he spoke to them. For four months he gave battle to 
unseen and silent foes compassing him on every side. 
He had no spirit for the fight; his love of Dorothy 
Hallowell and his complete rout there had taken the 
spirit out of him   &mdash;   and with it had gone that confidence 
in himself and in his luck which had won him so many 
critical battles. Then   &mdash;     He had been keeping up a 
large suite of offices, a staff of clerks and stenographers 
and all the paraphernalia of the great and successful 
lawyer. He had been spreading out the little business 
he got in a not unsuccessful effort to make it appear 
big and growing. He now gave up these offices and 
the costly pride, pomp and circumstance   &mdash;   left with 
several thousand dollars owing. He took two small rooms 
in a building tenanted by beginners and cheap shysters. 
He continued to live at his club, where even the servants 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0305" n="282"/>  
were subtly insolent to him; he could see the time 
approaching when he might have to let himself be dropped 
for failing to pay dues and bills. 
</p><p>He stared at his ruin in stupid and dazed amazement. 
Usually, to hear or to read about such a catastrophe 
as this is to get a vague, rather impressive 
notion of something picturesque and romantic. Ruined, 
like all the big fateful words, has a dignified sound. 
But the historians and novelists and poets and other 
keepers of human records have a pleasant, but not very 
honest way, of omitting practically all the essentials 
from their records and substituting glittering imaginings 
that delight the reader   &mdash;   and wofully mislead him 
as to the truth about life. What wonder that we 
learn slowly   &mdash;   and improve slowly. How wofully we 
have been, and are, misled by all upon whom we have 
relied as teachers. 
</p><p>Already one of these charming tales of majestic 
downfall was in process of manufacture, with Frederick 
Norman as the central figure. It was only awaiting 
his suicide or some other mode of complete submergence 
for its final glose of glamor. In this manufacture, the 
truth, as usual, had been almost omitted; such truth as 
was retained for this artistic version of a human 
happening was so perverted that it was falser than the 
simon pure fictions with which it was interwoven. Just 
as the literal truth about his success was far from being 
altogether to his credit, so the literal truth as to his fall 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0306" n="283"/>  
gave him little of the vesture of the hero, and that 
little ill fitting, to cover his naked humanness. Let 
him who has risen to material success altogether by 
methods approved by the idealists, let him who has 
fallen from on high with graceful majesty, without 
hysterical clutchings and desperate attempts at self-salvation in disregard of the safety of others   &mdash;   let either 
of these superhuman beings come forward with the first 
stone for Norman. 
</p><p>Those at some distance from the falling man could 
afford to be romantic and piteous over his fate. Those 
in his dangerous neighborhood were too busy getting 
out of the way. &ldquo;Man falling   &mdash;   stand from under!&rdquo; 
was the cry   &mdash;   how familiar it is!   &mdash;   and acquaintances 
and friends fled in mad skedaddle. He would surely be 
asking favors   &mdash;   would be trying to borrow money. It 
is no peculiarity of rats to desert a sinking ship; it is 
simply an inevitable precaution in a social system 
modeled as yet upon nature's cruel law of the survival of 
the fittest. A falling man is first of all a warning to 
all other men high enough up to be able to fall   &mdash;   a 
warning to them to take care lest they fall also where 
footing is so insecure and precipices and steeps beset 
every path. 
</p><p>Norman, falling, falling, gazed round him and up 
and down, in dazed wonder. He had seen many others 
fall. He had seen just where and just why they missed 
their footing. And he had been confident that with him 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0307" n="284"/>  
no such misstep was possible. He could not believe; a 
little while, and luck would turn, and up he would go 
again   &mdash;   higher than before. Many a lawyer   &mdash;   to look 
no farther than his own profession   &mdash;   had through 
recklessness or pride or inadvertence got the big men down 
on him. But after a time they had relented or had 
found an exact use for him; and fall had been succeeded 
by rise. Was there a single instance where a man of 
good brain had been permanently downed?  No, not 
one. Stay   &mdash;     Some of these unfortunates had failed to 
reappear on the heights of success. Yes, thinking of 
the matter, he recalled several such. Had he been 
altogether right in assuming, in his days of confidence and 
success, that they stayed down because they belonged 
down?  Perhaps he had judged them harshly?  Yes, 
he was sure he had judged them harshly. There was 
such a thing as breaking a proud spirit   &mdash;   and he found 
within himself apparent proof that precisely this calamity 
had befallen him. 
</p><p>There came a time   &mdash;   and it came soon   &mdash;   when he had 
about exhausted his desperate ingenuity at cornering 
acquaintances and former friends and &ldquo;sticking them 
up&rdquo; for loans of five hundred, a hundred, fifty, twenty-five   &mdash;     Because these vulgar and repulsive facts are not 
found in the usual records of the men who have dropped 
and come up again, do not imagine that only the hopeless 
and never-reappearing failures pass through such 
experiences. On the contrary, they are part of the 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0308" n="285"/>  
common human lot, and few indeed are the men who 
have not had them   &mdash;   and worse   &mdash;   if they could but be 
brought to tell the truth. Destiny rarely permits any 
one of us to go from cradle to grave without doing 
many a thing shameful and universally condemned. 
How could it be otherwise under our social system? 
When Norman was about at the end of all his resources 
Tetlow called on him   &mdash;   Tetlow, now a partner in the 
Lockyer firm. 
</p><p>He came with an air of stealth. &ldquo;I don't want 
anyone to know I'm doing this,&rdquo; said he frankly. &ldquo;If 
it got out, I'd be damaged and you'd not profit.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Rarely does anyone, however unworthy   &mdash;   and Fred 
Norman was far from unworthy, as we humans go   &mdash;    
rarely does anyone find himself absolutely without a 
friend. There is a saying that no man ever sunk so 
low, ever became so vile and squalid in soul and body, 
but that if he were dying, and the fact were noised 
throughout the world, some woman somewhere would 
come   &mdash;   perhaps from a sense of duty, perhaps from 
love, perhaps for the sake of a moment of happiness 
long past but never equaled, and so never forgotten   &mdash;    
but from whatever motive, she would come. In the 
same manner, anyone in dire straits can be sure of some 
friend. There were several others whom Norman had 
been expecting   &mdash;   men he had saved by his legal 
ingenuity at turning points in their careers. None of 
these was so imprudent as uselessly to involve himself. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0309" n="286"/>  
It was Tetlow who came   &mdash;   Tetlow, with whom his 
accounts were more than balanced, with the balance 
against him. Tetlow, whom he did not expect. 
</p><p>Norman did not welcome him effusively. He said 
at once:  &ldquo;How is   &mdash;   she?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow shifted uneasily. &ldquo;I don't know. She's not 
with us. I gave her a place there   &mdash;   to get her away 
from Culver. But she didn't stay long. No doubt she's 
doing well.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you cared about her,&rdquo; said Norman, 
who in estimating Tetlow's passion had measured it by 
his own, had neglected to consider that the desires of 
most men soon grow short of breath and weary of leg. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   so I did care for her,&rdquo; said Tetlow, in the 
voice of a man who has been ill but is now well. &ldquo;But 
that's all over. Women aren't worth bothering about 
much. They're largely vanity. The way they soon 
take a man for granted if he's at all kind to them 
discourages any but the poorest sort of fool. At least 
that's my opinion.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then you don't come from her?&rdquo; said Norman 
with complete loss of interest in his caller. 
</p><p>&ldquo;No. I've come   &mdash;    Fred, I hear you're in difficulties.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman's now deep-set eyes gleamed humorously in 
his haggard and failed-looking face. &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">In</hi> difficulties? 
Not at all. I'm <hi rend="italic">under</hi> them   &mdash;   drowned 
forty fathoms 
deep.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0310" n="287"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Then you'll not resent my coming straight to the 
point and asking if I can help you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's a rash offer, Tetlow. I never suspected 
rashness was one of your qualities.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't mean to offer you a loan or anything of 
that sort,&rdquo; pursued Tetlow. &ldquo;There's only one thing 
that can help a man in your position. He must either 
be saved outright or left to drown. I've come with 
something that may save you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>There was so much of the incongruous in a situation 
where <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was listening to an offer of 
salvation from 
such a man as Billy Tetlow that Norman smiled. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;There's a chance that within six months or so   &mdash;    
perhaps sooner   &mdash;   Burroughs and Galloway may end 
their truce and declare war on each other. If so, 
Galloway will win. Anyhow, the Galloway connection would 
be better than the Burroughs connection.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman looked at Tetlow shrewdly. &ldquo;How do you 
know this?&rdquo; he asked. 
</p><p>Tetlow's eyes shifted. &ldquo;Can't tell you. But I 
know.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Galloway hates me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow nodded. &ldquo;You were the one who forced 
him into a position where he had to make peace with 
Burroughs. But Galloway's a big man, big enough to 
admire ability wherever he sees it. He has admired 
you ever since.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0311" n="288"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;And has given his business to another firm.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But if the break comes he'll need you. And he's 
the sort of man who doesn't hesitate to take what he 
needs.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Too remote,&rdquo; said Norman, and his despondent 
gesture showed how quickly hope had lighted up. 
&ldquo;Besides, Billy, I've lost my nerve. I'm no good.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But you've gotten over that   &mdash;   that attack of insanity.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman shook his head. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I can't understand it,&rdquo; ejaculated Tetlow. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you can't,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;But   &mdash;    
there it is.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You haven't seen her lately?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not since that day . . . Billy, she hasn't   &mdash;   &rdquo; 
Norman stopped, and Tetlow saw that his hands were 
trembling with agitation, and marveled. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied Tetlow. &ldquo;So far as I know, 
she's still respectable. But   &mdash;   why don't you go to see 
her?  I think you'd be cured.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; demanded Norman, the 
veins in his forehead bulging with the fury he was ready 
to release. 
</p><p>&ldquo;For no especial reason   &mdash;   on my honor, Fred,&rdquo; 
replied Tetlow. &ldquo;Simply because time works wonders 
in all sorts of ways, including infatuations. Also   &mdash;    
well, the fact is, it didn't seem to me that young lady 
improved on acquaintance. Maybe I got tired, or 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0312" n="289"/>  
piqued   &mdash;   I don't know. If she hadn't been a silly little 
fool, would she have refused you?  I know it sounds 
well   &mdash;   in a novel or a play   &mdash;   for a poor girl to refuse a 
good offer, just from sentiment. But, all the same, 
only a fool girl does it   &mdash;   in life   &mdash;   eh?  But go to see 
her. You'll understand what I mean, I think. I want 
you to brace up. That may help.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What's she doing?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't know. I'll send you her address. I can 
get it. About Galloway   &mdash;     If that break comes, I 
propose that we get his business   &mdash;   you and I. I want you 
for a partner. I always did. I think I know how to 
get work out of you. I understand you better, than 
anyone else. That's why I'm here.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It's useless,&rdquo; said Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm willing to take the risk. Now, here's what I 
propose. I'll stake you to the extent of a thousand 
dollars a month for the next six months, you to keep 
on as you are and not to tie yourself up to any other 
lawyer, or to any client likely to hamper us if we get 
the Galloway business.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've been borrowing right and left   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I know about that,&rdquo; interrupted Tetlow. &ldquo;I'm 
not interested. If you'll agree to my proposal, I'll 
take my chances.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You are throwing away six thousand dollars.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I owe you a position where I make five times that 
much.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0313" n="290"/>  
</p><p>Norman shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Very well. Can 
I have five hundred at once?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'll send you a check to-day. I'll send two checks 
a month   &mdash;   the first and the fifteenth.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I am drinking a great deal.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You always did.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not until recently. I never knew what drinking 
meant until these last few months.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Well, do as you like with the money. Drink it 
all, if you please. I'm making no conditions beyond 
the two I stated.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You will send me that address?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;In the letter with the check.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Will she see me, do you think?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I haven't an idea,&rdquo; replied Tetlow. 
</p><p>&ldquo;What's the mystery?&rdquo; asked Norman. &ldquo;Why do 
you speak of her so indifferently?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It's the way I feel.&rdquo;  Then, in answer to the 
unspoken suspicion once more appearing in Norman's 
eyes, he added:  &ldquo;She's a very nice, sweet girl, Norman 
   &mdash;   so far as I know or believe. Beyond that   &mdash;     Go to 
see her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>It had been many a week since Norman had heard a 
friendly voice. The very sound of the human voice 
had become hateful to him, because he was constantly 
detecting the note of nervousness, the scarcely concealed 
fear of being entangled in his misfortunes. As Tetlow 
rose to go, Norman tried to detain him. The sound of 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0314" n="291"/>  
an unconstrained voice, the sight of a believing face 
that did not express one or more of the shadings of 
contempt between pity and aversion   &mdash;   the sight and 
sound of this friend Tetlow was acting upon him like 
one of those secret, unexpected, powerful tonics which 
nature at times suddenly injects into a dying man to 
confound the doctors and cheat death. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Tetlow,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I'm down   &mdash;   probably down for 
good. But if I ever get up again, I'll not make one 
mistake   &mdash;   the one that cost me this fall. Do you know 
what that mistake was?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean Miss Hallowell?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Norman, to his surprise. &ldquo;I mean my 
lack of money, of capital, of a large and secure income. 
I used to imagine that brains were the best, the only 
sure asset. I was guilty of the stupidity of overvaluing 
my own possessions.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Brains are a mighty good asset, Fred.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   and necessary. But a man of action must 
have under his brains another asset   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have it, 
Billy. The one secure asset is a big capital. Money 
rules this world. Some men have been lucky enough to 
rise and stay risen, without money. But not a man 
of all the men who have been knocked out could have 
been dislodged if he had been armed and armored with 
money. My prodigality was my fatal mistake. I 
shan't make it again   &mdash;   if I get the chance. You don't 
know, Tetlow, how hard it is to get money when you are 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0315" n="292"/>  
tumbling and must have it. I never dreamed what a 
factor it is in calamities of <hi rend="italic">every</hi> 
sort. It's <hi rend="italic">the</hi> factor.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't like to hear you talk that way, Norman,&rdquo; 
said Tetlow earnestly. &ldquo;I've always most admired in 
you the fact that you weren't mercenary.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And I never shall be,&rdquo; said Norman, with the 
patient smile of a swift, keen mind at one that is slow 
and hard to make understand. &ldquo;It isn't my nature. 
But, if I'm resurrected, I'll seem to be mercenary until 
I get a full suit of the only armor that's invulnerable in 
this world. Why, I built my fort like a fool. It was 
impregnable except for one thing   &mdash;   one obvious thing. 
It hadn't a supply of water. If I build again it'll be 
round a spring   &mdash;   an income big enough for my needs 
and beyond anybody's power to cut off.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow showed that he was much cheered by Norman's 
revived interest in life. But he went away 
uneasy; for the last thing Norman said to him was: 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't forget that address!&rdquo;</p> 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0316" n="293"/>  
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="15" id="d21"> 
<head>XV</head> 
 
<p>BUT it chanced that Norman met her in the street 
about an hour after Tetlow's call. 
</p><p>He was on the way to lunch at the Lawyer's Club 
   &mdash;   one of those apparent luxuries that are the dire and 
pitiful necessities of men in New York fighting to maintain 
the semblance and the reputation of prosperity. 
It must not be imagined by those who are here let into 
Norman's inmost secrets that his appearance betrayed 
the depth to which he had fallen. At least to the casual 
eye he seemed the same rich and powerful personage. 
An expert might have got at a good part of the truth 
from his somber eyes and haggard face, from the subtle 
transformation of the former look of serene pride into 
the bravado of pretense. And as, in a general way, 
the facts of his fall were known far and wide, all his 
acquaintances understood that his seeming of undiminished 
success was simply the familiar &ldquo;bluff.&rdquo;  Its 
advantage to him with them lay in its raising a doubt as 
to just what degree of disaster it hid   &mdash;   no small advantage. 
Nor was this &ldquo;bluff&rdquo; altogether for the benefit 
of the outside world. It made his fall less hideously 
intolerable to himself. In the bottom of his heart he 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0317" n="294"/>  
knew that when drink and no money should finally force 
him to release his relaxing hold upon his fashionable 
clubs, upon luxurious attire and habits, he would 
suddenly and with accelerated speed drop into the abyss   &mdash;    
We have all caught glimpses of that abyss   &mdash;   frayed fine 
linen cheaply laundered, a tie of one time smartness 
showing signs of too long wear, a suit from the best 
kind of tailor with shiny spot glistening here, patch 
peeping there, a queer unkemptness about the hair and 
skin   &mdash;   these the beginnings of a road that leads straight 
and short to the barrel-house, the park bench, and the 
police station. Because, when a man strikes into that 
stretch of the road to perdition, he ceases to be one of 
our friends, passes from view entirely, we have the habit 
of <hi rend="italic">saying</hi> that such things rarely if 
ever happen. But 
we <hi rend="italic">know</hi> better. Many's the man now 
high who has 
had the sort of drop Norman was taking. We remember 
when he was making a bluff such as Norman was 
making in those days; but we think now that we were 
mistaken in having suspected it of being bluff. 
</p><p>Norman, dressed with more than ordinary care   &mdash;    
how sensitive a man becomes about those things when 
there is neither rustle nor jingle in his pockets, and 
his smallest check would be returned with the big black 
stamp &ldquo;No Funds&rdquo;   &mdash;     Norman, groomed to the last 
button, was in Broadway near Rector Street. Ahead 
of him he saw the figure of a girl   &mdash;   a trim, attractive 
figure, slim and charmingly long of line. A second 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0318" n="295"/>  
glance, and he recognized her. What was the change 
that had prevented his recognizing her at once?  He 
had not seen that particular lightish-blue dress before 
   &mdash;   nor the coquettish harmonizing hat. But that was 
not the reason. No, it was the coquetry in her toilet   &mdash;    
the effort of the girl to draw attention to her charms 
by such small devices as are within the reach of 
extremely modest means. He did not like this change. 
It offended his taste; it alarmed his jealousy. 
</p><p>He quickened his step, and when almost at her side 
spoke her name   &mdash;   &ldquo;Miss Hallowell.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She stopped, turned. As soon as she recognized 
him there came into her quiet, lovely face a delightful 
smile. He could not conceal his amazement. She was 
glad to see him!  Instantly, following the invariable 
habit of an experienced analytical mind, he wondered 
for what unflattering reason this young woman who 
did not like him was no longer showing it, was seeming 
more than a little pleased to see him. &ldquo;Why, how d'ye 
do, Mr. Norman?&rdquo; said she. And her friendliness and 
assurance of manner jarred upon him. There was not 
a suggestion of forwardness; but he, used to her old-time extreme reserve, felt precisely as if she were bold 
and gaudy, after the fashion of so many of the working 
girls who were popular with the men. 
</p><p>This unfavorable impression disappeared   &mdash;   or, 
rather, retired to the background   &mdash;   even as it became 
definite. And once more he was seeing the charms of 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0319" n="296"/>  
physical loveliness, of physical   &mdash;   and moral, and mental   &mdash;    
mystery that had a weird power over him. As 
they shook hands, a quiver shot through him as at the 
shock of a terrific stimulant; and he stood there longing 
to take her in his arms, to feel the delicate yet perfect 
and vividly vital life of that fascinating form   &mdash;    
longing to kiss that sensitive, slightly pouted rosy 
mouth, to try to make those clear eyes grow soft and 
dreamy   &mdash;      &mdash;    
</p><p>She was saying:  &ldquo;I've been wondering what had 
become of you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I saw Tetlow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He promised to send 
me your address.&rdquo; 
</p><p>At Tetlow's name she frowned slightly; then a 
gleam of ridicule flitted into her eyes. &ldquo;Oh, that silly, 
squeamish old maid!  How sick I got of him!&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman winced, and his jealousy stirred. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; 
he asked. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Always warning me against everybody. Always 
giving me advice. It was too tiresome. And at last he 
began to criticize me   &mdash;   the way I dressed   &mdash;   the way I 
talked   &mdash;   said I was getting too free in my manner. 
The impudence of him!&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman tried to smile. 
</p><p>&ldquo;He'd have liked me to stay a silly little mouse 
forever.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;So you've been   &mdash;   blossoming out?&rdquo; said Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;In a quiet way,&rdquo; replied she, with a smile of self-
   <pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0320" n="297"/>  
content, so lovely as a smile that no one would have 
minded its frank egotism. &ldquo;There isn't much chance 
for fun   &mdash;   unless a girl goes too far. But at the same 
time I don't intend life to be Sunday when it isn't work. 
I got very cross with him   &mdash;   Mr. Tetlow, I mean. And 
I took another position. It didn't pay quite so well   &mdash;    
only fifteen a week. But I couldn't stand being 
watched   &mdash;   and guyed by all the other girls and boys 
for it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you working?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;With an old lawyer named Branscombe. It's awful 
slow, as I'm the only one, and he's old and does 
everything in an old-fashioned way. But the hours are 
easy, and I don't have to get down till nine   &mdash;   which 
is nice when you've been out at a dance the night before.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman kept his eyes down to hide from her the 
legion of devils of jealousy. &ldquo;You <hi rend="italic">have</hi> changed,&rdquo; he 
said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm growing up,&rdquo; replied she with a charming toss 
of her small head   &mdash;   what beautiful effects the sunlight 
made in among those wavy strands and strays! 
</p><p>&ldquo;And you're as lovely as ever   &mdash;   lovelier,&rdquo; he said   &mdash;    
and his eyes were the eyes of the slave she had spurned. 
</p><p>She did not spurn him now   &mdash;   and it inflamed his 
jealousy that she did not. She said:  &ldquo;Oh, what's the 
good of looks?  The town's full of pretty girls. And 
so many of them have money   &mdash;   which I haven't. To 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0321" n="298"/>  
make a hit in New York a girl's got to have both looks 
and dress. But I must be going. I've an engagement 
to lunch   &mdash;   &rdquo;  She gave a proud little smile   &mdash;   &ldquo;at the 
Astor House. It's nice upstairs there.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;With Bob Culver?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She laughed. &ldquo;I haven't seen him since I left his 
office. You know, Mr. Tetlow took me with him   &mdash;   back 
to your old firm. I didn't like Mr. Culver. I don't 
care for those black men. They are bad-tempered and 
two-faced. Anyhow, I'd not have anything to do with 
a man who wanted to slip round with me as if he were 
ashamed of me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was looking at Norman pleasantly enough. He 
wasn't sure that the hit was for him as well as for 
Culver, but he flushed deeply. &ldquo;Will you lunch with me 
at the Astor House at one to-morrow?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've got an engagement,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;And I must 
be going. I'm awfully late.&rdquo;  He had an instinct that 
her engagement on both days was with the same man. 
&ldquo;I'm glad to have seen you   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Won't you let me call on you?&rdquo; he said imploringly, 
but with the suggestion that he had no hope of 
being permitted to come. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; responded she with friendly promptness. 
She opened the shopping bag swinging on her 
arm. &ldquo;Here is one of my cards.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;When?  This evening?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her laugh showed the beautiful deep pink and dazzling 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0322" n="299"/>  
white behind her lips. &ldquo;No   &mdash;   I'm going to a 
party.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Let me take you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She shook her head. &ldquo;You wouldn't like it. Only 
young people.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I'm not so old.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She looked at him critically. &ldquo;No   &mdash;   you're not. 
It always puzzled me. You aren't old   &mdash;   you look like 
a boy lots of the time. But you always <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> old to 
me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'll try to do better. To-night?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not to-night,&rdquo; laughed she. &ldquo;Let's see   &mdash;   to-morrow's Sunday. Come to-morrow   &mdash;   about half past 
two.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said so gratefully that he cursed 
himself for his folly as he heard his voice   &mdash;   the idiotic 
folly of so plainly betraying his feelings. No wonder 
she despised him!  Beginning again   &mdash;   and beginning; 
wrong. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;  Her eyes, her smile flashed and he 
was alone, watching her slender grace glide through 
the throngs of lower Broadway. 
</p><p>At his office again at three, he found a note from 
Tetlow inclosing another of Dorothy's cards and also 
the promised check. Into his face came the look that 
always comes into the faces of the prisoners of despair 
when the bolts slide back and the heavy door swings 
and hope stands on the threshold instead of the familiar 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0323" n="300"/>  
grim figure of the jailer. &ldquo;This looks like the 
turn of the road,&rdquo; he muttered. Yes, a turn it certainly 
was   &mdash;   but was it <hi rend="italic">the</hi> turn?  &ldquo;I'll know 
more as to 
that,&rdquo; said he with a glance at the clock, &ldquo;about this 
time to-morrow.&rdquo; 
 
</p><p>It was a boarding house on the west side. And 
when the slovenly, smelly maid said, &ldquo;Go right up to 
her room,&rdquo; he knew it was   &mdash;   probably respectable, but 
not rigidly respectable. However, working girls must 
receive, and they cannot afford parlors and chaperons. 
Still   &mdash;     It was no place for a lovely young girl, full 
of charm and of love of life   &mdash;   and not brought up in 
the class where the women are trained from babyhood 
to protect themselves. 
</p><p>He ascended two flights, knocked at the door to the 
rear. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; called a voice, and he entered. It 
was a small neat room, arranged comfortably and with 
some taste. He recognized at first glance many little 
things from her room in the Jersey City house   &mdash;   things 
he had provided for her. On the chimney piece was a 
large photograph of her father   &mdash;   Norman's eyes hastily 
shifted from that. The bed was folded away into 
a couch   &mdash;   for space and for respectability. At first 
he did not see her. But when he advanced a step 
farther, she was disclosed in the doorway of a deep closet 
that contained a stationary washstand. 
</p><p>He had never seen her when she was not fully 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0324" n="301"/>  
dressed. He was now seeing her in a kind of wrapper 
   &mdash;   of pale blue, clean but not fresh. It was open at the 
throat; its sleeves fell away from her arms. And, to 
cap the climax of his agitation, her hair, her wonderful 
hair, was flowing loosely about her face and shoulders. 
</p><p>&ldquo;What's the matter with you?&rdquo; she cried laughingly. 
Her eyes sparkled and danced; the waves of her 
hair, each hair standing out as if it were alive, sparkled 
and danced. It was a smile never to be forgotten. 
&ldquo;Why are you so embarrassed?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He was embarrassed. He was thrilled. He was 
enraged   &mdash;   enraged because, if she would thus receive 
him whom she did not like, she would certainly thus 
receive any man. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't mind you,&rdquo; she went on, mockingly. &ldquo;I'd 
have to be careful if it was one of the boys.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Do you receive the   &mdash;   boys   &mdash;   here?&rdquo; demanded he 
glumly, his voice arrogant with the possessive rights a 
man feels when he cares for a woman, whether she cares 
for him or not. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; scoffed she. &ldquo;Where else would I 
see them?  I don't make street corner dates, thank you. 
You're as bad as fat, foolish Mr. Tetlow.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said he humbly. 
</p><p>She straightway relented, saying:  &ldquo;Of course I'd 
not let one of the boys come up when I was dressed like 
this. But I didn't mind <hi rend="italic">you</hi>.&rdquo;  He 
winced at this 
amiable, unconscious reminder of her always exasperating 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0325" n="302"/>  
and tantalizing and humiliating indifference to him   &mdash;    
&ldquo;And as I'm going to a grand dance to-night I simply 
had to wash my hair. Does that satisfy you, Mr. 
Primmey?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He hid the torment of his reopened wound and seated 
himself at the center table. She returned to a chair 
in the window where the full force of the afternoon sun 
would concentrate upon her hair. And he gazed spell 
bound. He had always known that her hair was fine. 
He had never dreamed it was like this. It was thick, 
it was fine and soft. In color, as the sunbeams streamed 
upon it, it was all the shades of gold and all the other 
beautiful shades between brown and red. It fell about 
her face, about her neck, about her shoulders in a 
gorgeous veil. And her pure white skin   &mdash;     It was an even 
more wonderful white below the line of her collar   &mdash;    
where he had never seen it before. Such exquisitely 
modeled ears   &mdash;   such a delicate nose   &mdash;   and the curve of 
her cheeks   &mdash;   and the glory of her eyes!  He clinched 
his teeth and his hands, sat dumb with his gaze down. 
</p><p>&ldquo;How do you like my room?&rdquo; she chattered on. 
&ldquo;It's not so bad   &mdash;   really quite comfortable   &mdash;   though 
I'm afraid I'll be cold when the weather changes. But 
it's the best I can do. As it is, I don't see how I'm 
going to make ends meet. I pay twelve of my fifteen 
for this room and two meals. The rest goes for lunch 
and car fare. As soon as I have to get clothes   &mdash;   &rdquo;  She 
broke off, laughing. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0326" n="303"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what then?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm sure I don't know,&rdquo; replied she carelessly. 
&ldquo;Perhaps old Mr. Branscombe'll give me a raise. Still, 
eighteen or twenty is the most I could hope for   &mdash;   and 
that wouldn't mean enough for clothes.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She shook her head vigorously and her hair stood 
out yet more vividly and the sunbeams seemed to go 
mad with joy as they danced over and under and 
through it. He had ventured to glance up; again he 
hastily looked down. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You spoiled me,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Those few 
months over there in Jersey City. It made <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a 
change in me, though I didn't realize it at the time. 
You see, I hadn't known since I was a tiny little girl 
what it was to live really decently, and so I was able 
to get along quite contentedly. I didn't know any 
better.&rdquo;  She made a wry face. &ldquo;How I loathe the 
canned and cold storage stuff I have to eat nowadays. 
And how I do miss the beautiful room I had in that big 
house over there! and how I miss Molly and Pat   &mdash;   and 
the garden   &mdash;   and doing as I pleased   &mdash;   and the clothes I 
had:  I thought I was being careful and not spoiling 
myself. You may not believe it, but I was really 
conscientious about spending money.&rdquo;  She laughed in a 
queer, absent way. &ldquo;I had such a funny idea of what 
I had a right to do and what I hadn't. And I didn't 
spend so very much on out-and-out luxury. But   &mdash;    
enough to spoil me for this life.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0327" n="304"/>  
</p><p>As Norman listened, as he noted   &mdash;   in her appearance, 
manner, way of talking   &mdash;   the many meaning signs 
of the girl hesitating at the fork of the roads   &mdash;   he felt 
within him the twinges of fear, of jealousy   &mdash;   and 
through fear and jealousy, the twinges of conscience. 
She was telling the truth. He had undermined her ability 
to live in purity the life to which her earning power 
assigned her. . . . <hi rend="italic">Why</hi> had she been 
so friendly to 
him?  Why had she received him in this informal, almost 
if not quite inviting fashion? 
</p><p>&ldquo;So you think I've changed?&rdquo; she was saying. 
&ldquo;Well   &mdash;   I have. Gracious, what a little fool I was!&rdquo; 
</p><p>His eyes lifted with an agonized question in them. 
</p><p>She flushed, glanced away, glanced at him again 
with the old, sweet expression of childlike innocence 
which had so often made him wonder whether it was 
merely a mannerism, or was a trick, or was indeed a 
beam from a pure soul. &ldquo;I'm foolish still   &mdash;   in certain 
ways,&rdquo; she said significantly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;And you always intend to be?&rdquo; suggested he with 
a forced smile. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh   &mdash;   yes,&rdquo; replied she   &mdash;   positively enough, yet it 
somehow had not the full force of her simple short 
statements in the former days. 
</p><p>He believed her. Perhaps because he wished to 
believe, must believe, would have been driven quite mad 
by disbelief. Still, he believed. As yet she was good. 
But it would not last much longer. With him   &mdash;   or 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0328" n="305"/>  
with some other. If with him, then certainly afterward 
with another   &mdash;   with others. No matter how jealously 
he might guard her, she would go that road, if once she 
entered it. If he would have her for his very own he 
must strengthen her, not weaken her, must keep her 
&ldquo;foolish still   &mdash;   in certain ways.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He said:  &ldquo;There's nothing in the other sort of life.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's what they say,&rdquo; replied she, with ominous 
irritation. &ldquo;Still   &mdash;   some girls   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">lots</hi> 
of girls seem to 
get on mighty well without being so terribly particular.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You ought to see them after a few years.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm only twenty-one,&rdquo; laughed she. &ldquo;I've got 
lots of time before I'm old. . . . You haven't   &mdash;   married?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I thought I'd have heard, if you had.&rdquo;  She 
laughed queerly   &mdash;   again shook out her hair, and it 
shimmered round her face and over her head and out 
from her shoulders like flames. &ldquo;You've got a kind of 
a   &mdash;   Mr. Tetlow way of talking. It doesn't remind me 
of you as you were in Jersey City.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She said nothing, she suggested nothing that had 
the least impropriety in it, or faintest hint of 
impropriety. It was nothing positive, nothing aggressive, 
but a certain vague negative something that gave him 
the impression of innocence still innocent but looking 
or trying to look tolerantly where it should not. And 
he felt dizzy and sick, stricken with shame and remorse 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0329" n="306"/>  
and jealous fear. Yes   &mdash;   she was sliding slowly, 
gently, unconsciously down to the depth in which he 
had been lying, sick and shuddering   &mdash;   no, to deeper 
depths   &mdash;   to the depths where there is no light, no trace 
of a return path. And he had started her down. He 
had done it when he, in his pride and selfishness, had 
ignored what the success of his project would mean 
for her. But he knew now; in bitterness and shame and 
degradation he had learned. &ldquo;I was infamous!&rdquo; he 
said to himself. 
</p><p>She began to talk in a low, embarrassed voice: 
</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think of getting married. There's a 
young man   &mdash;   a young lawyer   &mdash;   he makes twenty-five 
a week, but it'll be years and years before he has a 
good living. A man doesn't get on fast in New York 
unless he has pull.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman, roused from his remorse, blazed inside. 
&ldquo;You are in love with him?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She laughed, and he could not tell whether it was 
to tease him or to evade. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You'd not care about him long,&rdquo; said Norman, 
&ldquo;unless there were more money coming in than he'd 
be likely to get soon. Love without money doesn't go 
   &mdash;   at least, not in New York.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Do you suppose I don't know that?&rdquo; said she 
with the irritation of one faced by a hateful fact. 
&ldquo;Still   &mdash;   I don't see what to do.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman, biting his lip and fuming and observing 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0330" n="307"/>  
her with jealous eyes, said in the best voice he could 
command, &ldquo;How long have you been in love with him?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Did I say I was in love?&rdquo; mocked she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You didn't say you weren't. Who is he?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;If you'll stay on about half an hour or so, you'll 
see him. No   &mdash;   you can't. I've got to get dressed before 
I let him up. He has very strict ideas   &mdash;   where I'm concerned.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then why did you let <hi rend="italic">me</hi> come 
up?&rdquo; Norman said, 
with a penetrating glance. 
</p><p>She lowered her gaze and a faint flush stole into her 
cheeks. Was it confession of the purpose he suspected? 
Or, was it merely embarrassment? 
</p><p>&ldquo;I heard of a case once,&rdquo; continued Norman, his 
gaze significantly direct, &ldquo;the case of a girl who was 
in love with a poor young fellow. She wanted money 
   &mdash;   luxury. Also, she wanted the poor young fellow.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The color flamed into the girl's face, then left it pale. 
Her white fingers fluttered with nervous grace into her 
masses of hair and back to her lap again, to rest there 
in timid quiet. 
</p><p>&ldquo;She knew another man,&rdquo; pursued Norman, &ldquo;one 
who was able to give her what she wanted in the way of 
comfort. So, she decided to make an arrangement with 
the man, and keep it hidden from her lover   &mdash;   and in that 
way get along pleasantly until her lover was in better 
circumstances .&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her gaze was upon her hands, listless in her lap. He 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0331" n="308"/>  
felt that he had spoken her unspoken, probably 
unformed thoughts. Yes, unformed. Men and women, 
especially women, habitually pursued these unacknowledged 
and   &mdash;   even unformed purposes, in their conflicts of 
the desire to get what they wanted and their desire to 
appear well to themselves. 
</p><p>&ldquo;What would you think of an arrangement like 
that?&rdquo; asked he, determined to draw her secret heart 
into the open where he could see, where she could see. 
</p><p>She lifted frank, guileless eyes to his. &ldquo;I suppose 
the girl was trying to do the best she could.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What do you think of a girl who'd do that?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't judge anybody   &mdash;   any more. I've found out 
that this world isn't at all as I thought   &mdash;   as I was 
taught.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Would <hi rend="italic">you</hi> do it?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She smiled faintly. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied uncertainly. 
Then she restored his wavering belief in her essential 
honesty and truthfulness by adding:  &ldquo;That is to say, I 
don't think I would.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She busied herself with her hair, feeling it to see 
whether it was not yet dry, spreading it out. He looked 
at her unseeingly. At last she said:  &ldquo;You must go. 
I've got to get dressed.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   I must be going,&rdquo; said he absently, rising 
and reaching for his hat on the center table. 
</p><p>She stood up, put out her hand. &ldquo;I'm glad you 
came.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0332" n="309"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said he, still in the same abstraction. 
He shook hands with her, moved hesitatingly toward the 
door. With his hand on the knob he turned and glanced 
keenly at her. He surprised in her face a look of mystery   &mdash;    
of seriousness, of sadness   &mdash;   was there anxiety in it, 
also?  And then he saw a certain elusive reminder of her 
father   &mdash;   and it brought to him with curious force the 
memory of how she had been brought up, of what must 
be hers by inheritance and by training   &mdash;   she, the daughter 
of a great and simple and noble man   &mdash;    
</p><p>&ldquo;You'll come again?&rdquo; she said, and there was the 
note in her voice that made his nerves grow tense and 
vibrate. 
</p><p>But he seemed not to have heard her question. Still 
at the unopened door, he folded his arms upon his chest 
and said, speaking rapidly yet with the deliberation of 
one who has thought out his words in advance: 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't know what kind of girl you are. I never 
have known. I've never wanted to know. If you told 
me you were   &mdash;   what is called good, I'd doubt it. If you 
told me you weren't, I'd want to kill you and myself. 
They say there's a fatal woman for every man and a 
fatal man for every woman. I always laughed at the 
idea   &mdash;   until you. I don't know what to make of myself.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She suddenly laid her finger on her lips. It irritated 
him, to discover that, as he talked, speaking the things 
that came from the very depths of his soul, she had been 
giving him only part of her attention, had been listening 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0333" n="310"/>  
for a step on the stairs. He was hearing the ascending 
step now. He frowned. &ldquo;Can't you send him away?&rdquo; 
he asked. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I must,&rdquo; said she in a low tone. &ldquo;It wouldn't do 
for him to know you were here. He has strict ideas   &mdash;    
and is terribly jealous.&rdquo; 
</p><p>A few seconds of silence, then a knock on the other 
side of the door. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; she called. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm a little early,&rdquo; came in an agreeable, young 
man's voice. &ldquo;Aren't you ready?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not nearly,&rdquo; replied she, in a laughing, innocent 
voice. &ldquo;You'll have to go away for half an hour.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'll wait out here on the steps.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her eyes were sparkling. A delicate color had 
mounted to her skin. Norman, watching her jealously, 
clinched his strong jaws. She said:  &ldquo;No   &mdash;   you must 
go clear away. I don't want to feel that I'm being 
hurried. Don't come back until a quarter past four.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;All right. I'm crazy to see you.&rdquo;  This in the 
voice of a lover. She smiled radiantly at Norman, as if 
she thought he would share in her happiness at these 
evidences of her being well loved. The unseen young 
man said:  &ldquo;Exactly a quarter past. What time does 
your clock say it is now?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;A quarter to,&rdquo; replied she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's what my watch says. So there'll be no 
mistake. For half an hour   &mdash;   good-by!&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0334" n="311"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Half an hour!&rdquo; she called. 
</p><p>She and Norman stood in silence until the footsteps 
died away. Then she said crossly to Norman:  &ldquo;You 
ought to have gone before. I don't like to do these 
things.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You do them well,&rdquo; said he, with a savage gleam. 
</p><p>She was prompt and sure with his punishment. She 
said, simply and sweetly:  &ldquo;I'd do anything to keep <hi rend="italic">his</hi> 
good opinion of me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman felt and looked cowed. &ldquo;You don't know 
how it makes me suffer to see you fond of another man,&rdquo; 
he cried. 
</p><p>She seemed not in the least interested, went to the 
mirror of the bureau and began to inspect her hair with 
a view to doing it up. &ldquo;You can go in five minutes,&rdquo; 
said she. &ldquo;By that time he'll be well out of the way. 
Anyhow, if he saw you leaving the house he'd not know 
but what you had been to see some one else. He knows 
you by reputation but not by sight.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman went to her, took her by the shoulders gently 
but strongly. &ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>She looked at him with an expression, or perhaps 
absence of expression, that was simple listening. 
</p><p>&ldquo;If you meant awhile ago some such thing as I 
hinted   &mdash;   I will have nothing to do with it. You must 
marry me   &mdash;   or it's nothing at all.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her gaze did not wander, but before his wondering 
eyes she seemed to fade, fade toward colorlessness insignificance. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0335" n="312"/>  
The light died from her eyes, the flush of 
health from her white skin, the freshness from her lips, 
the sparkle and vitality from her hair. A slow, gradual 
transformation, which he watched with a frightened 
tightening at the heart. 
</p><p>She said slowly:  &ldquo;You   &mdash;   want   &mdash;   me   &mdash;   to   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">marry</hi>   &mdash;    
you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've always wanted it, though I didn't realize,&rdquo; 
replied he. &ldquo;How else could I be sure of you?  Besides   &mdash;   &rdquo; 
He flushed, added hurriedly, almost in an undertone   &mdash;    
&ldquo;I owe it to you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She seated herself deliberately. 
</p><p>After he had waited in vain for her to speak, he 
went on:  &ldquo;If you married me, I know you'd play square. 
I could trust you absolutely. I don't know   &mdash;   can't find 
out much about you   &mdash;   but at least I know that.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I don't love you,&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You needn't remind me of it,&rdquo; rejoined he curtly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't think so   &mdash;   so poorly of you as I used to,&rdquo; 
she went on. &ldquo;I understand a lot of things better 
than I did. But I don't love you, and I feel that I 
never could.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'll risk that,&rdquo; said Norman. Through his 
clinched teeth, &ldquo;I've got to risk it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'd be marrying you because I don't feel able to 
   &mdash;   to make my own way.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's the reason most girls have for marrying,&rdquo; 
said he. &ldquo;Love comes afterward   &mdash;   if it comes. And 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0336" n="313"/>  
it's the more likely to come for the girl not having 
faked the man and herself beforehand.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She glanced at the clock. He frowned. She started 
up. &ldquo;You <hi rend="italic">must</hi> go,&rdquo; she said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;What is your answer?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I couldn't decide so quickly. I must think.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You mean you must see your young man again 
   &mdash;   see whether there isn't some way of working it out 
with him.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That, too,&rdquo; replied she simply. &ldquo;But   &mdash;   it's nearly 
four o'clock   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'll come back at seven for my answer.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No, I'll write you to-night.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I must know at once. This suspense has got to 
end. It unfits me for everything.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'll   &mdash;   I'll decide   &mdash;   to-night,&rdquo; she said, with a queer 
catch in her voice. &ldquo;You'll get the letter in the morning 
mail.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;  And he gave her his club address. 
</p><p>She opened the door in her impatience to be rid of 
him. He went with a hasty &ldquo;Good-by&rdquo; which she 
echoed as she closed the door. 
</p><p>When he left the house he saw standing on the curb 
before it a tall, good-looking young man   &mdash;   with a frank 
amiable face. He hesitated, glowering at the young 
man's profile. Then he went his way, suffocating with 
jealous anger, depressed, despondent, fit for nothing 
but to drink and to brood in fatuous futility.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="16" id="d22"> 
<head>XVI</head> 
<p>UNTIL very recently indeed psychology was not an 
ology at all but an indefinite something or other &ldquo;up 
in the air,&rdquo; the sport of the winds and fogs of 
transcendental tommy rot. Now, however, science has drawn 
it down, has fitted it in its proper place as a branch of 
physiology. And we are beginning to have a clearer 
understanding of the thoughts and the thought-producing 
actions of ourselves and our fellow beings. Soon 
it will be no longer possible for the historian and the 
novelist, the dramatist, the poet, the painter or sculptor 
to present in all seriousness as instances of sane human 
conduct, the aberrations resulting from various forms 
of disease ranging from indigestion in its mild, temper-breeding forms to acute homicidal or suicidal mania. 
In that day of greater enlightenment a large body of 
now much esteemed art will become ridiculous. Practically 
all the literature of strenuous passion will go by 
the board or will be relegated to the medical library 
where it belongs; and it, and the annals of violence 
found in the daily newspapers of our remote time will 
be cited as documentary proof of the low economic and 
hygienic conditions prevailing in that almost barbarous 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0338" n="315"/>  
period. For certain it is that the human animal when 
healthy and well fed is invariably peaceable and kindly 
and tolerant   &mdash;   up to the limits of selfishness, and even 
encroaching upon those limits. 
</p><p>Of writing rubbish about love and passion there is 
no end   &mdash;   and will be no end until the venerable traditional 
nonsense about those interesting emotions shares 
the fate that should overtake all the cobwebs of ignorance 
thickly clogging the windows and walls of the 
human mind. Of all the fiddle-faddle concerning passion 
probably none is more shudderingly admired than the 
notion that one possessed of an overwhelming desire for 
another longs to destroy that other. It is true there 
is a form of murderous mania that involves practically 
all the emotions, including of course the passions   &mdash;   which 
are as readily subject to derangement as any other part 
of the human organism. But passion in itself   &mdash;   even 
when it is so powerful that it dominates the whole life, 
as in the case of Frederick Norman   &mdash;   passion in itself 
is not a form of mental derangement in the medical 
sense. And it does not produce acute selfishness, 
paranoiac egotism, but a generous and beautiful kind of 
unselfishness. Not from the first moment of Fred Norman's 
possession did he wish to injure or in any way 
to make unhappy the girl he loved. He longed to be 
happy with her, to have her happy with and through 
him. He represented his plotting to himself as a plan 
to make her happier than she ever had been; as for 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0339" n="316"/>  
ultimate consequences, he refused to consider them. 
The most hardened rake, when passion possesses him, 
wishes all happiness to the woman of his pursuit. 
Indifference, coldness   &mdash;   the natural hard-heartedness of 
the normal man   &mdash;   returns only when the inspiration and 
elevation of passion disappear in satiety. The man or 
the woman who continues to inspire passion continues 
to inspire tenderness and considerateness. 
</p><p>So when Norman left Dorothy that Sunday afternoon, 
he, being a normal if sore beset human being, was 
soon in the throes of an agonized remorse. There may 
have been some hypocrisy in it, some struggling to cover 
up the baser elements in his infatuation for her. What 
human emotion of upward tendency has not at least a 
little of the varnish of hypocrisy on certain less presentable 
spots in it?  But in the main it was a creditable, 
a manly remorse, and not altogether the writhings of 
jealousy and jealous fear of losing her. 
</p><p>He saw clearly that she was telling the truth, and 
telling it too gently, when she said he was responsible 
for her having standards of living which she could not 
unaided hope to attain. It is a dreadful thing to interfere 
in the destiny of a fellow being. We do it all the 
time; we do it lightly. Nevertheless, it is a dreadful 
thing   &mdash;   not one that ought not to be done, but one that 
ought to be done only under imperative compulsion, 
and then with every precaution. He had interfered in 
Dorothy Hallowell's destiny. He had lifted her out of 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0340" n="317"/>  
the dim obscure niche where she was ensconced in 
comparative contentment. He had lifted her up where she 
had seen and felt the pleasures of a life of luxury. 
</p><p>&ldquo;But for me,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;she would now 
be marrying this poor young lawyer, or some chap of 
the same sort, and would be looking forward to a life 
of happiness in a little flat or suburban cottage.&rdquo; 
</p><p>If she should refuse his offer   &mdash;   what then?  Clearly 
he ought to do his best to help her to happiness with 
the other man. He smiled cynically at the moral height 
to which his logic thus pointed the way. Nevertheless, 
he did not turn away but surveyed it   &mdash;   and there formed 
in his mind an impulse to make an effort to attempt 
that height, if Fate should rule against him with her. 
&ldquo;If I were a really decent man,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;I'd 
sit down now and write her that I would not marry 
her but would give her young man a friendly hand in 
the law if she wished to marry him.&rdquo;  But he knew that 
such utter generosity was far beyond him. &ldquo;Only a 
hero could do it,&rdquo; said he; he added with what a 
sentimentalist might have called a return of his normal 
cynicism, &ldquo;only a hero who really in the bottom of 
his heart didn't especially want the girl.&rdquo;  And a 
candid person of experience might possibly admit that 
there was more truth than cynicism in his look askance 
at the grand army of martyrs of renunciation, most 
of whom have simply given up something they didn't 
really want. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0341" n="318"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;If she accepts me, I'll make it impossible for her 
not to be happy,&rdquo; he said to himself, in all the fine 
unselfishness of passion   &mdash;   not divine unselfishness but 
human   &mdash;   not the kind we read about and pretend to have 
   &mdash;   and get a savage attack of bruised vanity if we are 
accused of not having it   &mdash;   no, but just the kind we 
have and show in our daily lives   &mdash;   the unselfishness of 
longing to make happy those whom it would make us 
happier to see happy. &ldquo;She may think she cares for 
this young clerk   &mdash;   &rdquo; so ran his thoughts   &mdash;   &ldquo;but she 
doesn't know her own mind. When she is mine, I'll take 
her in hand as a gardener does a delicate rare flower 
   &mdash;   and, by Heaven, how I shall make her blossom and 
bloom!&rdquo; 
</p><p>It would hardly be possible for a human being to 
pass a stormier night than was that night of his. 
Alternations between hope and despair   &mdash;   fantastic 
pictures of future with and without her, wild pleadings 
with her   &mdash;   those delirious transports to which our 
imaginations give way if we happen to be blessed and cursed 
with imaginations   &mdash;   in the security of the darkness and 
aloneness of night and bed. And through it all he was 
tormented body and soul by her loveliness   &mdash;   her hair, 
her skin, her eyes, the shy, slender graces of her form   &mdash;    
He tossed about until his bed was so wildly disheveled 
that he had to rise and remake it. 
</p><p>When day came and the first mail, there was her 
letter on the salver of the boy entering the room. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0342" n="319"/>  
He reached for it with eager, trembling arm, drew back. 
&ldquo;Put it on the table,&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>The boy left. He was alone. Leaning upon his 
elbow in the bed he stared at the letter with hollow, 
terrified eyes. It contained his destiny. If she accepted, 
he would go up, for his soul sickness would be cured. 
If she refused, he would cease to struggle. He rose, 
took from a locked drawer a bottle of rye whisky. He 
poured a tall glass   &mdash;   the kind called a bar glass   &mdash;   half 
full, drank it straight down without a pause or a quiver. 
The shock brought him up standing. He looked and 
acted like his former self as he went to the table, took 
the letter, opened it, and read: 
 
</p><p>&ldquo;I am willing to marry you, if you really want me. 
I am so tired of struggling, and I don't see anything but 
dark ahead.   &mdash;   D. H.&rdquo; 
 
</p><p>Norman struggled over to the bed, threw himself 
down, flat upon his back, arms and legs extended wide 
and whole body relaxed. He felt the blood whirl up 
into his brain like the great red and black tongues of 
flame and smoke in a conflagration, and then he slept 
soundly until nearly one o'clock. 
</p><p>To an outsider there would have been a world of 
homely commonplace pathos in that little letter of the 
girl's if read aright, that is to say, if read with what 
was between the lines supplied. It is impossible to live 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0343" n="320"/>  
in cities any length of time and with any sort of eyes 
without learning the bitter unromantic truths about 
poverty   &mdash;   city poverty. In quiet, desolate places one 
may be poor, very poor, without much conscious 
suffering. There are no teasing contrasts, no torturing 
temptations. But in a city, if one knows anything at 
all of the possibilities of civilized life, of the joys and 
comforts of good food, clothing, and shelter, of theater 
and concert and excursion, of entertaining and being 
entertained, poverty becomes a hell. In the country, 
in the quiet towns, the innocent people wonder at the 
greediness of the more comfortable kinds of city people, 
at their love of money, their incessant dwelling upon 
it, their reverence for those who have it, their panic-like flight from those who have it not. They wonder 
how folk, apparently human, can be so inhuman. Let 
them be careful how they judge. If you discover any 
human being anywhere acting as you think a human 
being should not, investigate all the circumstances, look 
thoroughly into all the causes of his or her conduct, 
before you condemn him or her as inhuman, unworthy of 
your kinship and your sympathy. 
</p><p>In her brief letter the girl showed that, young though 
she was and not widely experienced in life, she yet had 
seen the horrors of city poverty, how it poisons and 
kills all the fine emotions. She had seen many a loving 
young couple start out confidently, with a few hundred 
dollars of debt for furniture   &mdash;   had seen the love fade 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0344" n="321"/>  
and wither, shrivel, die   &mdash;   had seen appear peevishness 
and hatred and unfaithfulness and all the huge, foul 
weeds that choke the flowers of married life. She knew 
what her lover's salary would buy   &mdash;   and what it would 
not buy   &mdash;   for two. She could imagine their fate if 
there should be three or more. She showed frankly her 
selfishness of renunciation. But there could be read 
between the lines   &mdash;   concealed instead of vaunted   &mdash;   perhaps 
unsuspected   &mdash;   her unselfishness of renunciation for 
the sake of her lover and for the sake of the child or 
the children that might be. In our love of moral sham 
and glitter, we overlook the real beauties of human 
morality; we even are so dim or vulgar sighted that we 
do not see them when they are shown to us. 
</p><p>As Norman awakened, he reached for the telephone, 
said to the boy in charge of the club exchange:  &ldquo;Look 
in the book, find the number of a lawyer named Branscombe, 
and connect me with his office.&rdquo;  After some 
confusion and delay he got the right office, but Dorothy 
was out at lunch. He left a message that she was to 
call him up at the club as soon as she came in. He was 
shaving when the bell rang. 
</p><p>He was at the receiver in a bound. &ldquo;Is it you?&rdquo; 
he said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came in her quiet, small voice. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Will you resign down there to-day?  Will you 
marry me this afternoon?&rdquo; 
</p><p>A brief silence, then   &mdash;   &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0345" n="322"/>  
</p><p>Thus it came about that they met at the City Hall 
license bureau, got their license, and half an hour later 
were married at the house of a minister in East Thirty-third Street, within a block of the Subway station. He 
was feverish, gay, looked years younger than his thirty-seven. She was quiet, dim, passive, neither grave nor 
gay, but going through her part without hesitation, 
with much the same patient, plodding expression she 
habitually bore as she sat working at her machine   &mdash;   as 
if she did not quite understand, but was doing her best 
and hoped to get through not so badly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've had nothing to eat,&rdquo; said he as they came out 
of the parsonage. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;We'll go to Delmonico's,&rdquo; said he, and hailed a 
passing taxi. 
</p><p>On the way, he sitting in one corner explained to her, 
shrunk into the other corner:  &ldquo;I can confess now that 
I married you under false pretenses. I am not prosperous, 
as I used to be. To be brief and plain, I'm down 
and out, professionally.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She did not move. Apparently she did not change 
expression. Yet he, speaking half banteringly, felt 
some frightful catastrophe within her. &ldquo;You are   &mdash;    
poor?&rdquo; she said in her usual quiet way. 
</p><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">We</hi> are poor,&rdquo; corrected he.  
&ldquo;I have at present 
only a thousand dollars a month   &mdash;   a little more, but not 
enough to talk about.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0346" n="323"/>  
</p><p>She did not move or change expression. Yet he felt 
that her heart, her blood were going on again. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Are you   &mdash;   angry?&rdquo; he asked. 
</p><p>&ldquo;A thousand dollars a month seems an awful lot of 
money to me,&rdquo; she said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;It's nothing   &mdash;   nothing to what we'll soon have. 
Trust me.&rdquo;  And back into his eyes flashed their former 
look. &ldquo;I've been sick. I'm well again. I shall get 
what I want. If you want anything, you've only to 
ask for it. I'll get it. I know how. . . . I don't prey, 
myself   &mdash;   I've no fancy for the brutal sports. But I 
teach lions how to prey, and I make them pay for the 
lessons.&rdquo;  He laughed with an effervescing of young 
vitality and self-confidence that made him look handsome 
and powerful. &ldquo;In the future they'll have to pay still 
higher prices.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was looking at him with weary, wondering, 
pathetic eyes that gazed from the pallor of her dead-white face mysteriously. 
</p><p>&ldquo;What are you thinking?&rdquo; he asked. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I was listening,&rdquo; replied she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn't it make you happy   &mdash;   what you are going 
to have?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied she. &ldquo;But it makes me content.&rdquo; 
</p><p>With eyes suddenly suffused, he took her hand   &mdash;   so 
gently. &ldquo;Dorothy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will try to love 
me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'll try,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You'll be kind to me?&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0347" n="324"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn't be anything else,&rdquo; he cried. And in a 
gust of passion he caught her to his breast and kissed 
her triumphantly. &ldquo;I love you   &mdash;   and you're mine   &mdash;   mine!&rdquo; 
</p><p>She released herself with the faint insistent push 
that seemed weak, but always accomplished its purpose. 
Her lip was trembling. &ldquo;You said you'd be kind,&rdquo; she 
murmured. 
</p><p>He gazed at her with a baffled expression. &ldquo;Oh   &mdash;   I 
understand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I shall be kind. But I 
must teach you to love me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her trembling lip steadied. &ldquo;You must be careful 
or you may teach me to hate you,&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>He studied her in a puzzled way, laughed. &ldquo;What 
a mystery you are!&rdquo; he cried with raillery. &ldquo;Are you 
child or are you woman?  No matter. We shall be 
happy.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The taxicab was swinging to the curb. In the 
restaurant he ordered an enormous meal. And he ate 
enormously, and drank in due proportion. She ate and 
drank a good deal herself   &mdash;   a good deal for her. And 
the results were soon apparent in a return of the spirits 
that are normal to twenty-one years, regardless of what 
may be lurking in the heart, in a dark corner, to come 
forth and torment when there is nothing to distract the 
attention. 
</p><p>&ldquo;We shall have to live quietly for a while,&rdquo; said he. 
&ldquo;Of course you must have clothes-at once. I'll take 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0348" n="325"/>  
you shopping to-morrow.&rdquo;  He laughed grimly. 
&ldquo;Just at present we can get only what we pay cash for. 
Still, you won't need much. Later on I'll take you over 
to Paris. Does that attract you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her eyes shone. &ldquo;How soon?&rdquo; she asked. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I can tell you in a week or ten days.&rdquo;  He became 
abstracted for a moment. &ldquo;I can't understand how I 
let them get me down so easily   &mdash;   that is, I can't understand 
it now. I suppose it's just the difference between 
being weak with illness and strong with health.&rdquo;  His 
eyes concentrated on her. &ldquo;Is it really you?&rdquo; he cried 
gaily. &ldquo;And are you really mine?  No wonder I feel 
strong!  It was always that way with me. I never 
could leave a thing until I had conquered it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She gave him a sweet smile. &ldquo;I'm not worth all the 
trouble you seem to have taken about me,&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>He laughed; for he knew the intense vanity so 
pleasantly hidden beneath her shy and modest exterior. 
&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said he good-humoredly, &ldquo;you in 
your heart think yourself worth any amount of trouble. 
It's a habit we men have got you women into. And 
you   &mdash;     One of the many things that fascinate me in 
you is your supreme self-control. If the king were to 
come down from his throne and fall at your feet, you'd 
take it as a matter of course.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She gazed away dreamily. And he understood that 
her indifference to matters of rank and wealth and 
power was not wholly vanity but was, in part at least, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0349" n="326"/>  
due to a feeling that love was the only essential. Nor 
did he wonder how she was reconciling this belief of high 
and pure sentiment with what she was doing in marrying 
him. He knew that human beings are not consistent, 
cannot be so in a universe that compels them to 
face directly opposite conditions often in the same 
moment. But just as all lines are parallel in infinity, so 
all actions are profoundly consistent when referred to 
the infinitely broad standard of the necessity that every 
living thing shall look primarily to its own well being. 
Disobedience to this fundamental carries with it 
inevitable punishment of disintegration and death; and 
those catastrophes are serious matters when one has but 
the single chance at life, that will be repeated never 
again in all the eternities. 
</p><p>After their late lunch or early dinner, they drove to 
her lodgings. He went up with her and helped her to 
pack   &mdash;   not a long process, as she had few belongings. 
He noted that the stockings and underclothes she took 
from the bureau drawers were in anything but good 
condition, that the half dozen dresses she took from the 
closet and folded on the couch were about done for. 
Presently she said, cheerfully and with no trace of false 
shame: 
</p><p>&ldquo;You see, I'm pretty nearly in rags.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that's soon arranged,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;Why 
bother to take these things?  Why not give them to 
the maid?&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0350" n="327"/>  
</p><p>She debated with herself. &ldquo;I think you're right,&rdquo; 
she decided. &ldquo;Yes, I'll give them to Jennie.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;The underclothes, too,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;And the 
hats.&rdquo; 
</p><p>It ended in her having left barely enough loosely to 
fill the bottom of a small trunk with two trays. 
</p><p>They drove to the Knickerbocker Hotel, and he took 
a small suite, one of the smallest and least luxurious in 
the house, for with all his desire to make her feel the 
contrast of her change of circumstances sharply, he 
could not forget how limited his income was, and how 
unwise it would be to have to move in a few days to 
humbler quarters. He hoped that the rooms, 
englamoured by the hotel's general air of costly luxury, 
would sufficiently impress her. And while she gave no 
strong indication but accepted everything in her wonted 
quiet, passive manner, he was shrewd enough to see that 
she was content. &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he said to himself, 
&ldquo;after she has done some shopping, the last regret will 
leave her, and her memory of that clerk will begin to 
fade fast. I'll give her too much else to think about.&rdquo; 
 
</p><p>The following morning, when they faced each other 
at breakfast in their sitting room, he glanced at her 
from time to time in wonder and terror. She looked not 
merely insignificant, but positively homely. Her skin 
had a sickly pallor; her hair seemed to be of many 
different and disagreeable shades of uninteresting dead 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0351" n="328"/>  
yellow. Her eyes suggested faded blue china dishes, 
with colorless lashes and reddened edges of the lids. 
Her lips had lost their rosy freshness, her teeth their 
sparkling whiteness. 
</p><p>His heavy heart seemed to be resting nauseously 
upon the pit of his stomach. Was his infatuation sheer 
delusion, with no basis of charm in her at all?  Was 
she, indeed, nothing but this unattractive, faded little 
commonplaceness?   &mdash;   a poor specimen of an inferior 
order of working girl?  What an awakening!  And she 
was his <hi rend="italic">wife!</hi>   &mdash;   was his companion for 
the yet more 
brilliant career he had resolved and was planning!  He 
must introduce her everywhere, must see the not to be 
concealed amazement in the faces of his acquaintances, 
must feel the cruel covert laughter and jeering at his 
weak folly!  Was there ever in history or romance a 
parallel to such fatuity as his?  Why, people would be 
right in thinking him a sham, a mere bluffer at the high 
and strong qualities he was reputed to have. 
</p><p>Had Norman been, in fact, the man of ice and iron 
the compulsions of a career under the social system made 
him seem, the homely girl opposite him that morning 
would speedily have had something to think about other 
than her unhappiness of the woman who has given her 
person to one man and her heart to another. Instead, 
the few words he addressed to her were all gentleness and 
forbearance. Stronger than his chagrin was his pity 
for her   &mdash;   the poor, unconscious victim of his mad hallucination. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0352" n="329"/>  
If she thought about the matter at all, she 
assumed that he was still the slave of her charms   &mdash;   for, 
the florid enthusiasm of man's passion inevitably deludes 
the woman into fancying it objective instead of wholly 
subjective; and, only the rare very wise woman, after 
much experience, learns to be suspicious of the validity 
of her own charms and to concentrate upon keeping up 
the man's delusions. 
</p><p>At last he rose and kissed her on the brow and let 
his hand rest gently on her shoulder   &mdash;   what a difference 
between those caresses and the caresses that had made 
her beg him to be &ldquo;kind&rdquo; to her!  Said he: 
</p><p>&ldquo;Do you mind if I leave you alone for a while?  I 
ought to go to the club and have the rest of my things 
packed and sent. I'll not be gone long   &mdash;   about an 
hour.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said she lifelessly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'll telephone my office that I'll not be down 
to-day.&rdquo; 
</p><p>With an effort she said, &ldquo;There's no reason for 
doing that. I don't want to interfere with your business.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm neglecting nothing. And that shopping must 
be done.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She made no reply, but went to the window, and 
from the height looked down and out upon the mighty 
spread of the city. He observed her a moment with a 
dazed pitying expression, took his hat and departed. 
</p><p>It was nearly two hours before he got together sufficient 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0353" n="330"/>  
courage to return. He had been hoping   &mdash;   had 
been saying to himself with vigorous effort at confidence 
   &mdash;   that he had simply seen one more of the many 
transformations, each of which seemed to present her as a 
wholly different personality. When he should see her 
again, she would have wiped out the personality that 
had shocked and saddened him, would appear as some 
new variety of enchantress, perhaps even more potent 
over his senses than ever before. But a glance as he 
entered demolished that hope. She was no different 
than when he left. Evidently she had been crying, and 
spasms of that sort always accentuate every unloveliness. 
He did not try to nerve himself to kiss her, but 
said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;It'll not take you long to get ready?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She moved to rise from her languid rest upon the 
sofa. She sank back. &ldquo;Perhaps we'd better not go 
to-day,&rdquo; suggested she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't you feel well?&rdquo; he asked, and his tone was 
more sympathetic than it would have been had his sympathy 
been genuine. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not very,&rdquo; replied she, with a faint deprecating 
smile. &ldquo;And not very   &mdash;   not very   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not very what?&rdquo; he said, in a tone of encouragement. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not very happy,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;I'm afraid 
I've made a   &mdash;   a dreadful mistake.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He looked at her in silence. She could have said 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0354"/> 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0355"/>
 

<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0356" n="331"/>  
nothing that would have caused a livelier response within 
himself. His cynicism noted the fact that while he had 
mercifully concealed his discontent, she was thinking 
only of herself. But he did not blame her. It was 
only the familiar habit of the sex, bred of man's 
assiduous cultivation of its egotism. He said:  &ldquo;Oh, you'll 
feel differently about it later. Let's get some fresh air 
and see what the shops have to offer.&rdquo; 
</p><p>A pause, then she, timidly:  &ldquo;Would you mind very 
much if I   &mdash;   if I didn't   &mdash;   go on?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You mean, if you left me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She nodded without looking at him. He could not 
understand himself, but as he sat observing her, so 
young, so inexperienced and so undesirable, a pity of 
which he would not have dreamed his nature capable 
welled up in him, choking his throat with sobs he could 
scarcely restrain and filling his eyes with tears he had 
secretly to wipe away. And he felt himself seized of a 
sense of responsibility for her as strong in its solemn, 
still way as any of the paroxysms of his passion had 
been. 
</p><p>He said:  &ldquo;My dear   &mdash;   you mustn't decide anything 
so important to you in a hurry.&rdquo; 
</p><p>A tremor passed over her, and he thought she was 
going to dissolve in hysterics. But she exhibited once 
more that marvelous and mysterious self-control, whose 
secret had interested and baffled him. She said in her 
dim, quiet way: 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0357" n="332"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;It seems to me I just can't stay on.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You can always go, you know. Why not try it a 
few days?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He could feel the trend of her thoughts, and in the 
way things often amuse us without in the least moving 
us to wish to laugh, he was amused by noting that she 
was trying to bring herself to stay on, out of consideration 
for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> feelings!  He said with a kind 
of paternal 
tenderness: 
</p><p>&ldquo;Whenever you want to go, I am willing to arrange 
things for you   &mdash;   so that you needn't worry about money. 
But I feel that, as I am older than you, I ought to do all 
I can to keep you from making a mistake you might 
soon regret.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She studied him dubiously. He saw that she   &mdash;    
naturally enough   &mdash;   did not believe in his disinterestedness, 
that she hadn't a suspicion of his change, or, 
rather collapse, of feeling. She said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;If you ask it, I'll stay a while. But you must 
promise to   &mdash;   to be kind to me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>There was only gentleness in his smile. But what a 
depth of satirical self-mockery and amusement at her 
innocent young egotism it concealed!  &ldquo;You'll never 
have reason to speak of that again, my dear,&rdquo; said he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I   &mdash;   can   &mdash;   trust you?&rdquo; she said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;I'll have another room 
opened into this suite. Would you like that?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;If you   &mdash;   if you don't mind.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0358" n="333"/>  
</p><p>He stood up with sudden boyish buoyance. &ldquo;Now 
   &mdash;   let's go shopping. Let's amuse ourselves.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She rose with alacrity. She eyed him uncertainly, 
then flung her arms round his neck and kissed him. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You are <hi rend="italic">so</hi> good to me!&rdquo; she 
cried. &ldquo;And I'm not a 
bit nice.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He did not try to detain her, but sent her to finish 
dressing, with an encouraging pat on the shoulder and a 
cheerful, &ldquo;Don't worry about yourself   &mdash;   or me.&rdquo;</p> 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0359" n="334"/>  
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="17" id="d23"> 
<head>XVII</head> 
<p>ABOUT half an hour later the door into the bedroom 
opened and she appeared on the threshold of the sitting 
room, ready for the street. He stared at her in the 
dazed amazement of a man faced by the impossible, and 
uncertain whether it is sight or reason that is tricking 
him. She had gone into the bedroom not only homely 
but commonplace, not only commonplace but common, 
a dingy washed-out blonde girl whom it would be a 
humiliation to present as his wife. She was standing there, 
in the majesty of such proud pale beauty as poets 
delight to ascribe to a sorrowful princess. Her wonderful 
skin was clear and translucent, giving her an ethereal 
look. Her hair reminded him again of what marvels he 
had seen in the sunlight of Sunday afternoon. And 
looking at her form and the small head so gracefully 
capping it, he could think only of the simile that had 
always come to him in his moments of ecstasy   &mdash;   the lily 
on its tall stem. 
</p><p>And once more, like a torrent, the old infatuation 
sprang from its dried sources and came rushing and 
overwhelming through vein and nerve. &ldquo;Am I mad 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0360" n="335"/>  
now?   &mdash;   was I mad a few moments ago?   &mdash;   is it she or is 
it my own disordered senses?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was drawing on her gloves, was unconscious of 
his confusion. He controlled himself and said:  &ldquo;You 
have a most disconcerting way of changing your appearance.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She glanced down at her costume. &ldquo;No, it's the 
same dress. I've only the one, you know.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He longed to take her in his arms, but could not 
trust himself. And this wonder-girl, his very own, was 
talking of leaving him!  And he   &mdash;   not an hour before   &mdash;    
he, apparently in his right senses had been tolerating 
such preposterous talk!  Give her up?  Never!  He 
must see to it that the subject did not find excuse for 
intruding again. &ldquo;I have frightened her   &mdash;   have 
disgusted her. I must restrain myself. I must be patient 
   &mdash;   and teach her slowly   &mdash;   and win her gradually.&rdquo; 
</p><p>They spent an interesting and even exciting afternoon, 
driving from shop to shop and selecting the first 
beginnings of her wardrobe. He had only about three 
hundred dollars. Some of the things they ordered were 
ready for delivery, and so had to be paid for at once. 
When they returned to the hotel he had but fifty dollars 
left   &mdash;   and had contracted debts that made it necessary 
for him to raise at least a thousand dollars within a week. 
He saw that his freedom with sums of money which 
terrified her filled her with awe and admiration   &mdash;   and that 
he was already more successful than he had expected to 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0361" n="336"/>  
be, in increasing her hesitation about leaving him. 
Among the things they had bought were a simple black 
chiffon dress and a big plumed black hat to match. 
These needed no alterations and were delivered soon 
after they returned. Some silk stockings came also and 
a pair of slippers bought for the dinner toilet. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You can dress to-night,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I'll take 
you to Sherry's, and to the theater afterwards.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was delighted. At last she was going to look 
like the women of whom she had been dreaming these 
last few months. She set about dressing herself, he 
waiting in the sitting room in a state of acute nervousness. 
What would be the effect of such a toilet?  Would 
she look like a lady   &mdash;   or like   &mdash;   what she had suggested 
that morning?  She was so changeable, had such a wide 
range of variability that he dared not hope. When she 
finally appeared, he was ready to fall down and worship. 
He was about to take her where his world would see her, 
where every inch of her would be subjected to the cruelest, 
most hostile criticism. One glance at her, and he 
knew a triumph awaited him. No man and no woman 
would wonder that he had lost his head over such beauty 
as hers. Hat and dress seemed just what had been 
needed to bring out the full glory of her charms. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You are incredibly beautiful,&rdquo; he said in an awed 
tone. &ldquo;I am proud of you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>A little color came into her cheeks. She looked at 
herself in the mirror with her quiet intense secret, yet 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0362" n="337"/>  
not covert vanity. He laughed in boyish pleasure. 
&ldquo;This is only the small beginning,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Wait a 
few months.&rdquo; 
</p><p>At dinner and in a box at the theater afterwards, he 
had the most exquisite pleasure of his life. She had been 
seen by many of his former friends, and he was certain 
they knew who she was. He felt that he would have no 
difficulty in putting her in the place his wife should 
occupy. A woman with such beauty as hers was a sensation, 
one fashionable society would not deny itself. 
She had good manners, an admirable manner. With a 
little coaching she would be as much at home in grandeur 
as were those who had always had it. 
</p><p>The last fear of losing her left him. On the way 
back to the hotel he, in a delirium of pride and passion, 
crushed her in his arms and caressed her with the frenzy 
that had always terrified her. She resisted only faintly, 
was almost passive. &ldquo;She is mine!&rdquo; he said to himself, 
exultantly. &ldquo;She is really mine!&rdquo; 
 
</p><p>When he awoke in the morning she was still asleep   &mdash;    
looked like a tired lovely child. Several times, while he 
was dressing, he went in to feast his eyes upon her 
beauty. How could he possibly have thought her 
homely, in whatever moment of less beauty or charm 
she might have had?  The crowning charm of infinite 
variety!  She had a delightfully sweet disposition. He 
was not sure how much or how little intelligence she 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0363" n="338"/>  
had   &mdash;   probably more than most women. But what did 
that matter?  It would be impossible ever to grow weary 
or to be anything but infatuated lover when she had 
such changeful beauty. 
</p><p>He kissed her lightly on her thick braids, as he was 
about to go. He left a note explaining that he did not 
wish to disturb her and that it was necessary for him 
to be at the office earlier. And that morning in all 
New York no man left his home for the day's struggle 
for dollars with a freer or happier heart, or readier to 
play the game boldly, skillfully, with success. 
</p><p>Certainly he needed all his courage and all his skill. 
</p><p>To most of the people who live in New York and 
elsewhere throughout the country   &mdash;   or the world, for 
that matter   &mdash;   an income of a thousand dollars a month 
seems extremely comfortable, to say the least of it. The 
average American family of five has to scrape along 
on about half that sum a year. But among the 
comfortable classes in New York   &mdash;   and perhaps in one or 
two other cities   &mdash;   a thousand dollars a month is literally 
genteel poverty. To people accustomed to what is 
called luxury nowadays   &mdash;   people with the habit of the 
private carriage, the private automobile, and several 
servants   &mdash;   to such people a thousand dollars a month is 
an absurd little sum. It would not pay for the food 
alone. It would not buy for a man and his wife, with 
no children, clothing enough to enable them to make a 
decent appearance. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0364" n="339"/>  
</p><p>Norman, living alone and living very quietly indeed, 
might have got along for a while on that sum, if he had 
taken much thought about expenditures, had persisted 
in such severe economies as using street cars instead of 
taxicabs and drinking whisky at dinner instead of his 
customary quart of six-dollar champagne. Norman, 
the married man, could not escape disaster for a single 
month on an income so pitiful. 
</p><p>Probably on the morning on which he set out for 
downtown in search of money enough to enable him to 
live decently, not less than ten thousand men on 
Manhattan Island left comfortable or luxurious homes faced 
with precisely the same problem. And each and every 
one of them knew that on that day or some day soon 
they must find the money demanded imperiously by their 
own and their families' tastes and necessities or be ruined 
   &mdash;   flung out, trampled upon, derided as failures, hated 
by the &ldquo;loved ones&rdquo; they had caused to be humiliated. 
And every man of that legion had a fine, an unusually 
fine brain   &mdash;   resourceful, incessant, teeming with schemes 
for wresting from those who had dollars the dollars they 
dared not go home without. And those ten thousand 
quickest and most energetic brains, by their mode of 
thought and action, determined the thought and action 
of the entire country   &mdash;   gave the mercenary and unscrupulous 
cast to the whole social system. Themselves the 
victims of conditions, they were the bellwethers to 
millions of victims compelled to follow their leadership. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0365" n="340"/>  
</p><p>Norman, by the roundabout mode of communication 
he and Tetlow had established, summoned his friend and 
backer to his office. &ldquo;Tetlow,&rdquo; he began straight off, 
&ldquo;I've got to have more money.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; said Tetlow. 
</p><p>&ldquo;More than you can afford to advance me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; repeated Tetlow. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Three thousand a month right away   &mdash;   at the 
least.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's a big sum,&rdquo; said Tetlow. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, for a man used to dealing in small figures. 
But in reality it's a moderate income.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Few large families spend more.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Few large or small families in my part of New 
York pinch along on so little.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What has happened to you?&rdquo; said Tetlow, dropping 
into a chair and folding his fat hands on his 
stomach. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;It's in your voice   &mdash;   in your face   &mdash;   in your cool 
demand for a big income.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Let's start right, old man,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;Don't 
<hi rend="italic">call</hi> thirty-six thousand a year big or 
you'll <hi rend="italic">think</hi> it big. 
And if you think it big, you will stay little.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow nodded. &ldquo;I'm ready to grow,&rdquo; said he. 
&ldquo;Now what's happened to you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've got married,&rdquo; replied Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I thought so. To Miss   &mdash;   Hallowell?&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0366" n="341"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;To Miss Hallowell. So my way's clear, and I'm 
going to resume the march.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've two plans. Either will serve. The first is 
yours   &mdash;   the one you partly revealed to me the other 
day.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Partly?&rdquo; said Tetlow. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Partly,&rdquo; repeated Norman, laughing. &ldquo;I know 
you, Billy, and that means I know you're absolutely 
incapable of plotting as big a scheme as you suggested 
to me. It came either from Galloway or from some one 
of his clique.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I said all I'm at liberty to say, Fred.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't wish you to break your promise. All I 
want to know is, can I get the three thousand a month 
and assurance of its lasting and leading to something 
bigger?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What is your other scheme?&rdquo; said Tetlow, and it 
was plain to the shrewder young lawyer that the less 
shrewd young lawyer wished to gain time. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Simple and sure,&rdquo; replied Norman. &ldquo;We will buy 
ten shares of Universal Fuel Company through a dummy 
and bring suit to dissolve it. I looked into the matter 
for Burroughs once when he was after the Fosdick-Langdon group. Universal Fuel wouldn't dare defend 
the action I could bring. We could get what we pleased 
for our ten shares to let up on the suit. The moment 
their lawyers saw the papers I'd draw, they'd advise it.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0367" n="342"/>  
</p><p>Tetlow shook his large, impressively molded head. 
&ldquo;Shady,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Shady.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman smiled with good-natured patience. &ldquo;You 
sound like Burroughs or Galloway when they are 
denouncing a man for trying to get rich by the same 
methods they pursued. My dear Bill, don't be one of 
those lawyers who will do the queer work for a client 
but not for themselves. There's no sense, no morality, 
no intelligent hypocrisy even, in that. We didn't create 
the commercial morality of the present day. For God's 
sake, let's not be of the poor fools who practice it but 
get none of its benefits.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow shifted uneasily. &ldquo;I don't like to hear that 
sort of thing,&rdquo; said he, apologetic and nervous. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. But   &mdash;   damn it, I don't like to hear it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That is to say, you're willing to pay the price of 
remaining small and obscure just for the pleasure of 
indulging in a wretched hypocrisy of a self-deception. 
Bill, come out of the small class. Whether you go in 
with me or not, come out of the class of understrappers. 
What's the difference between the big men and their 
little followers?  Why, the big men <hi rend="italic">see</hi>. They don't 
deceive themselves with the cant they pour out for the 
benefit of the ignorant mob.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow was listening like a pupil to a teacher. That 
was always his attitude toward Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;The big men,&rdquo; continued Norman, &ldquo;know that 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0368" n="343"/>  
canting is necessary   &mdash;   that one must always profess 
high and disinterested motives, and so on, and so on. 
But they don't let their hypocritical talk influence their 
actions. How is it with the little fellows?  Why, they 
believe the flapdoodle the leaders talk. They go into 
the enterprise, do all the small dirty work, lie and cheat 
and steal, and hand over the proceeds to the big fellows, 
for the sake of a pat on the back and a noisy `Honest 
fellow!  Here are a few crumbs for you.'  And crumbs 
are all that a weak, silly, hypocritical fool deserves. 
Can you deny it?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No doubt you're right, Fred,&rdquo; conceded Tetlow. 
&ldquo;But I'm afraid I haven't the nerve.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Come in behind me. I've got nerve for two   &mdash;    
<hi rend="italic">now!</hi>&rdquo; 
</p><p>At that triumphant &ldquo;now&rdquo; Tetlow looked curiously 
at his friend. &ldquo;Yes, <hi rend="italic">it</hi> has changed 
you   &mdash;   changed you 
back to what you were. I don't understand.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It isn't necessary that you understand,&rdquo; rejoined 
Norman.'' 
</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think you could really carry through that 
scheme you've just outlined?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I see it fascinates you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've no objection to rising to the class of big 
men,&rdquo; said Tetlow. &ldquo;But aren't you letting your 
confidence in yourself deceive you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Did I ever let it deceive me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; confessed Tetlow. &ldquo;I've often watched you, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0369" n="344"/>  
and thought you'd fall through it, or stumble at least. 
But you never did.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And shall I tell you why?  Because I use my self-confidence and my hopefulness and all my optimistic 
qualities only to create an atmosphere of success. But 
when it comes to planning a move of any kind, when 
I assemble my lieutenants round the council board in 
my brain, I never permit a single cheerful one to speak, 
or even to enter. It's a serious, gloomy circle of faces, 
Bill.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow nodded reminiscently. &ldquo;Yes, you always 
were like that, Fred.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And the one who does the most talking at my 
council is the gloomiest of all. He's Lieutenant Flaw-picker. He can't see any hope for anything. He sees 
all the possibilities of failure. He sees all the chances 
against success. And what's the result?  Why, when 
the council rises it has taken out of the plan every 
chance of mishap that my intelligence could foresee 
and it has provided not one but several safe lines of 
orderly retreat in case success proves impossible.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow gazed at Norman in worshipful admiration. 
&ldquo;What a brain!  What a mind!&rdquo; he ejaculated. 
&ldquo;And to think that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> could be upset 
by a <hi rend="italic">woman!</hi>&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman leaned back in his chair smiling broadly. 
&ldquo;Not by a woman,&rdquo; he corrected. &ldquo;By a girl   &mdash;   an 
inexperienced girl of twenty.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It seems incredible.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0370" n="345"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;A grain of dust, dropped into a watch movement 
in just the right place   &mdash;   you know what happens.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow nodded. Then, with a sharp, anxious look, 
&ldquo;But it's all over?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman hesitated. &ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>Tetlow rose and rubbed his thighs. He had been 
sitting long in the same position, and he was now stout 
enough to suffer from fat man's cramp. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said 
he, &ldquo;we needn't bother about that Universal Fuel 
scheme at present. I can guarantee you the three 
thousand dollars, and the other things.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman shook his head. &ldquo;Not enough,&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You want more money?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No. But I will not work, or rather, wait, in the 
dark. Tell your principals that I must be let in.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow hesitated, walking about the office. Finally 
he said, &ldquo;Look here, Fred   &mdash;   you think I deceived you 
the other day   &mdash;   posed as your friend when in reality 
I was simply acting as agent for people who wanted 
you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman gave Tetlow a look that made him redden 
with pleasure. &ldquo;No, I don't, old man,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I 
know you recommended me   &mdash;   and that they were shy of 
me because of the way I've been acting   &mdash;   and that you 
stood sponsor for me. Isn't that right?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; admitted Tetlow. &ldquo;But 
they were eager to get you. It was only a question of 
trusting you. I was able to do you a good turn there.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0371" n="346"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;And I'll make a rich man, and a famous one, of 
you,&rdquo; said Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. I believe you will,&rdquo; cried Tetlow, tears in 
his prominent studious eyes. &ldquo;I'll see those people in 
a day or two, and let you know. Do you need money 
right away?  Of course you do.&rdquo;  And down he sat and 
drew a check for fifteen hundred dollars. 
</p><p>Norman laughed as he glanced to see if it was 
correctly drawn. &ldquo;I'd not have dared return to my bride 
with empty pockets. That's what it means to live in 
New York.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow grinned. &ldquo;A sentimental town, isn't it? 
Especially the women.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I don't blame them,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;They 
need the money, and the only way they've got of making 
it is out of sentiment. And you must admit they 
give a bully good quality, if the payment is all right.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I'm glad I don't 
need them,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It gives me the creeps to see 
them gliding about with their beautiful dresses and 
their sweet, soft faces.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He and Norman lunched together in an out-of-the 
way restaurant. After a busy and a happy afternoon, 
Norman returned early to the hotel. He had cashed 
his check. He was in funds. He would give her 
another and more thrilling taste of the joy that was to 
be hers through him   &mdash;   and soon she would be giving 
even as she got   &mdash;   for he would teach her not to fear 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0372" n="347"/>  
love, not to shrink from it, but to rejoice in it and to 
let it permeate and complete all her charms. 
</p><p>He ascended to the apartment and knocked. There 
was no answer. He searched in vain for a chamber-maid to let him in. He descended to the office. &ldquo;Oh, 
Mr. Norman,&rdquo; said one of the clerks. &ldquo;Your wife left 
this note for you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman took it. &ldquo;She went out?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;About three o'clock   &mdash;   with a young gentleman 
who called on her. They came back a while ago and 
she left the note.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Norman. He took his key, 
went up to the apartment. Not until he had closed and 
locked the door did he open the note. He read: 
 
</p><p>&ldquo;Last night you broke your promise. So I am 
going away. Don't look for me. It won't be any use. 
When I decide what to do I'll send you word.&rdquo; 
 
</p><p>He was standing at the table. He tossed the note 
on the marble, threw open the bedroom door. The 
black chiffon dress, the big plumed hat, and all the 
other articles they had bought were spread upon the 
bed, arranged with the obvious intention that he should 
see at a glance she had taken nothing away with her. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;Why didn't I let her go 
yesterday morning?&rdquo;</p> 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0373" n="348"/>  
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="18" id="d24"> 
<head>XVIII</head> 
<p>A FEW days later, Tetlow, having business with Norman, 
tried to reach him by telephone. After several 
failures he went to the hotel, and in the bar learned 
enough to enable him to guess that Norman was of on 
a mad carouse. He had no difficulty in finding the trail 
or in following it; the difficulty lay in catching up, for 
Norman was going fast. Not until late at night   &mdash;   that 
is, early in the morning   &mdash;   of the sixth day from the 
beginning of his search did he get his man. 
</p><p>He was prepared to find a wreck, haggard, wildly 
nervous and disreputably disheveled; for, so far as he 
could ascertain Norman had not been to bed, but had 
gone on and on from one crowd of revelers to another, 
in a city where it is easy to find companions in dissipation 
at any hour of the twenty-four. Tetlow was even 
calculating upon having to put off their business many 
weeks while the crazy man was pulling through delirium 
tremens or some other form of brain fever. 
</p><p>An astonishing sight met his eyes in the Third 
Avenue oyster house before which the touring car Norman 
had been using was drawn up. At a long table, 
eating oysters as fast as the opener could work, sat 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0374" n="349"/>  
Norman and his friend Gaskill, a fellow member of the 
Federal Club, and about a score of broken and battered 
tramps. The supper or breakfast was going forward 
in admirable order. Gaskill, whom Norman had 
picked up a few hours before, showed signs of having 
done some drinking. But not Norman. It is true his 
clothing might have looked fresher; but hardly the 
man himself. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Just in time!&rdquo; he cried out genially, at sight of 
Tetlow. &ldquo;Sit down with us. Waiter, a chair next to 
mine. Gentlemen, Mr. Tetlow. Mr. Tetlow, gentlemen. 
What'll you have, old man?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow declined champagne, accepted half a dozen 
of the huge oysters. &ldquo;I've been after you for nearly 
a week,&rdquo; said he to Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Pity you weren't <hi rend="italic">with</hi> me,&rdquo; 
said Norman. &ldquo;I've 
been getting acquainted with large numbers of my fellow 
citizens.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;From the Bowery to Yonkers.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly. Don't fall asleep, Gaskill.&rdquo; 
</p><p>But Gaskill was snoring with his head on the back 
of his chair and his throat presented as if for the as 
of the executioner. &ldquo;He's all in,&rdquo; said Tetlow. 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's the way it goes,&rdquo; complained Norman. 
&ldquo;I can't find anyone to keep me company.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow laughed. &ldquo;You look as if you had just 
started out,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Tell me   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">where</hi> have you 
slept?&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0375" n="350"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;I haven't had time to sleep as yet.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I dropped in to suggest that a little sleep wouldn't 
do any harm.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not quite yet. Watch our friends eat. It gives 
me an appetite. Waiter, another dozen all round   &mdash;   and 
some more of this carbonated white wine you've labeled 
champagne.&rdquo; 
</p><p>As he called out this order, a grunt of satisfaction 
ran round the row of human derelicts. Tetlow shuddered, 
yet was moved and thrilled, too, as he glanced 
from face to face   &mdash;   those hideous hairy countenances, 
begrimed and beslimed, each countenance expressing 
in its own repulsive way the one emotion of gratified 
longing for food and drink. &ldquo;Where did you get 
'em?&rdquo; inquired he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;From the benches in Madison Square,&rdquo; replied 
Norman. He laughed queerly. &ldquo;Recognize yourself 
in any of those mugs, Tetlow?&rdquo; he asked. 
</p><p>Tetlow shivered. &ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; he exclaimed. 
</p><p>Norman's eyes gleamed. &ldquo;I see myself in all of 
'em,&rdquo; said he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Poor wretches!&rdquo; muttered Tetlow. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Pity wasted,&rdquo; he rejoined. &ldquo;You might feel 
sorry for a man on the way to where they've got. But 
once arrived   &mdash;   as well pity a dead man sleeping quietly 
in his box with three feet of solid earth between him and 
worries of every kind.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0376" n="351"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Shake this crowd,&rdquo; said Tetlow impatiently. &ldquo;I 
want to talk with you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;All right, if it bores you.&rdquo;  He sent the waiter 
out for enough lodging-house tickets to provide for all. 
He distributed them himself, to make sure that the 
proprietor of the restaurant did not attempt to graft. 
Then he roused Gaskill and bundled him into the car 
and sent it away to his address. The tramps 
gathered round and gave Norman three cheers   &mdash;   they 
pressed close while four of them tried to pick his and 
Tetlow's pockets. Norman knocked them away good-naturedly, and he and Tetlow climbed into Tetlow's 
hansom. 
</p><p>&ldquo;To my place,&rdquo; suggested Tetlow. 
</p><p>&ldquo;No, to mine   &mdash;   the Knickerbocker,&rdquo; replied Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'd rather you went to my place first,&rdquo; said 
Tetlow uneasily. 
</p><p>&ldquo;My wife isn't with me. She has left me,&rdquo; said 
Norman calmly. 
</p><p>Tetlow hesitated, extremely nervous, finally 
acquiesced. They drove a while in silence, then Norman 
said, &ldquo;What's the business?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Galloway wants to see you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Tell him to come to my office to-morrow   &mdash;   that 
means to-day   &mdash;   at any time after eleven.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But that gives you no chance to pull yourself 
together,&rdquo; objected Tetlow. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0377" n="352"/>  
</p><p>Norman's face, seen in the light of the street lamp 
they happened to be passing, showed ironic amusement. 
&ldquo;Never mind about me, Billy. Tell him to come.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow cleared his throat nervously. &ldquo;Don't you 
think, old man, that you'd better go to see him?  I'll 
arrange the appointment.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman said quietly:  &ldquo;Tetlow, I've dropped pretty 
far. But not so far that I go to my clients. The rule 
of calls is that the man seeking the favor goes to the 
man who can grant it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But it isn't the custom nowadays for a lawyer to 
deal that way with a man like Galloway.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And neither is it the custom for anyone to have 
any self-respect. Does Galloway need my brains more 
than I need his money, or do I need his money more 
than he needs my brains?  You know what the answer 
to that is, Billy. We are partners   &mdash;   you and I. I'm 
training you for the position.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Galloway won't come,&rdquo; said Tetlow curtly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;So much the worse for him,&rdquo; retorted Norman 
placidly. &ldquo;No   &mdash;   I've not been drinking too much, old 
man   &mdash;   as your worried   &mdash;   old-maid look suggests. Do a 
little thinking. If Galloway doesn't get me, whom 
will he get?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You know very well, Norman, there are scores of 
lawyers, good ones, who'd crawl at his feet for his 
business. Nowadays, most lawyers are always looking 
round for a pair of rich man's boots to lick.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0378" n="353"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;But I am not `most lawyers,' &rdquo; said Norman. 
&ldquo;Of course, if Galloway could make me come to him, 
he'd be a fool to come to me. But when he finds I'm 
not coming, why, he'll behave himself   &mdash;   if his business 
is important enough for me to bother with.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But if he doesn't come, Fred?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then   &mdash;   my Universal Fuel scheme, or some other 
equally good. But you will never see me limbering my 
knees in the anteroom of a rich man, when he needs 
me and I don't need him.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we'll see,&rdquo; said Tetlow, with the air of a 
sober man patient with one who is not sober. 
</p><p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; continued Norman, &ldquo;if Galloway 
says he's too ill to come   &mdash;   or anything of that sort   &mdash;    
tell him I'd not care to undertake the affairs of a man 
too old or too feeble to attend to business, as he might 
die in the midst of it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow's face was such a wondrous exhibit of 
discomfiture that Norman laughed outright. Evidently 
he had forestalled his fat friend in a scheme to get him 
to Galloway in spite of himself. &ldquo;All right   &mdash;   all right,&rdquo; 
said Tetlow fretfully. &ldquo;We'll sleep on this. But I 
don't see why you're so opposed to going to see the 
man. It looks like snobbishness to me   &mdash;   false pride   &mdash;    
silly false pride.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> snobbishness,&rdquo; said 
Norman. &ldquo;But you 
forget that snobbishness rules the world. The way to 
rule fools is to make them respect you. And the way 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0379" n="354"/>  
to make them respect you is by showing them that 
they are your inferiors. I want Galloway's respect 
because I want his money. And I'll not get his money   &mdash;    
as much of it as belongs to me   &mdash;   except by showing 
him my value. Not my value as a lawyer, for he 
knows that already, but my value as a man. Do you 
see?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No, I don't,&rdquo; snapped Tetlow. 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's what it means to be Tetlow. Now, I do 
see   &mdash;   and that's why I'm Norman.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow looked at him doubtfully, uncertain whether 
he had been listening to wisdom put in a jocose form 
of audacious egotism or to the effervescings of intoxication. 
The hint of a smile lurking in the sobriety of 
the powerful features of his extraordinary friend only 
increased his doubt. Was Norman mocking him, and 
himself as well?  If so, was it the mockery of sober 
sense or of drunkenness? 
</p><p>&ldquo;You seem to be puzzled, Billy,&rdquo; said Norman, and 
Tetlow wondered how he had seen. &ldquo;Don't get your 
brains in a stew trying to understand me. I'm acting 
the way I've always acted   &mdash;   except in one matter. You 
know that I know what I'm about?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I certainly do,&rdquo; replied his admirer. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Then, let it go at that. If you could understand 
me   &mdash;   the sort of man I am, the sort of thing I do   &mdash;    
you'd not need me, but would be the whole show yourself 
   &mdash;   eh? That being true, don't show yourself a commonplace 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0380" n="355"/>  
nobody by deriding and denying what your 
brain is unable to comprehend. Show yourself a 
somebody by seeing the limitations of your ability. The 
world is full of little people who criticise and judge and 
laugh at and misunderstand the few real intelligences. 
And very tedious interruptions of the scenery those little 
people are. Don't be one of them. . . . Did you know 
my wife's father?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow startled. &ldquo;No   &mdash;   that is, yes,&rdquo; he stammered. 
&ldquo;That is, I met him a few times.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Often enough to find out that he was crazy?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. He explained some of his ideas to me. 
Yes   &mdash;   he was quite mad, poor fellow.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman gave way to a fit of silent laughter. &ldquo;I 
can imagine,&rdquo; he presently said, &ldquo;what you'd have 
thought if Columbus or Alexander or Napoleon or 
Stevenson or even the chaps who doped out the telephone 
and the telegraph   &mdash;   if they had talked to you 
before they arrived. Or even after they arrived, if they 
had been explaining some still newer and bigger idea 
not yet accomplished.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You don't think Mr. Hallowell was mad?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;He was mad, assuming that you are the standard 
of sanity. Otherwise, he was a great man. There'll 
be statues erected and pages of the book of fame devoted 
to the men who carry out his ideas.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;His death was certainly a great loss to his daughter,&rdquo; 
said Tetlow in his heaviest, most bourgeois manner. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0381" n="356"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;I said he was a great man,&rdquo; observed Norman. 
&ldquo;I didn't say he was a great father. A great man is 
never a great father. It takes a small man to be a 
great father.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;At any rate, her having no parents or relatives 
doesn't matter, now that she has you,&rdquo; said Tetlow, his 
manner at once forced and constrained. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; muttered Norman. 
</p><p>Said Tetlow:  &ldquo;Perhaps you misunderstood why I   &mdash;    
I acted as I did about her, toward the last.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It was of no importance,&rdquo; said Norman brusquely. 
&ldquo;I wish to hear nothing about it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I must explain, Fred. She piqued me by 
showing so plainly that she despised me. I must admit 
the truth, though I've got as much vanity as the next 
man, and don't like to admit it. She despised me, and 
it made me mad.&rdquo; 
</p><p>An expression of grim satire passed over Norman's 
face. Said he:  &ldquo;She despised me, too.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, she did,&rdquo; said Tetlow. &ldquo;And both of us 
were certainly greatly her superiors   &mdash;   in every 
substantial way. It seemed to me most   &mdash;   most   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Most impertinent of her?&rdquo; suggested Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Precisely. <hi rend="italic">Most</hi> 
impertinent.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Rather say, ignorant and small. My dear Tetlow, 
let me tell you something. Anybody, however 
insignificant, can be loved. To be loved means nothing, 
except possibly a hallucination in the brain of the lover. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0382" n="357"/>  
But to <hi rend="italic">love</hi>   &mdash;   that's another matter.  
Only a great soul 
is capable of a great love.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; murmured Tetlow sentimentally, 
preening in a quiet, gentle way. 
</p><p>Said Norman sententiously:  &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">You</hi> stopped loving. 
It was <hi rend="italic">I</hi> that kept on.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow looked uncomfortable. &ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   yes,&rdquo; he said. 
&ldquo;But we were talking of her   &mdash;   of her not appreciating 
the love she got. And I was about to say   &mdash;   &rdquo; 
Earnestly   &mdash;     &ldquo;Fred, she's not to be blamed for her folly! 
She's very, very young   &mdash;   and has all the weaknesses and 
vanities of youth   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; interrupted Norman. 
</p><p>The hansom had stopped in Forty-second Street 
before the deserted but still brilliantly lighted entrances 
to the great hotel. Norman sprang out so lightly and 
surely that Tetlow wondered how it was possible for 
this to be the man who had been racketing and roistering 
day after day, night after night for nearly a week. 
He helped the heavy and awkward Tetlow to descend, 
said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;You'll have to pay, Bill. I've got less than a 
dollar left. And I touched Gaskill for a hundred and 
fifty to-night. You can imagine how drunk he was, to 
let me have it. How they've been shying off from 
<hi rend="italic">me</hi> these last few months!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And you want <hi rend="italic">Galloway</hi> to come 
to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>,&rdquo; thrust 
Tetlow, as he counted out the money. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0383" n="358"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't go back and chew on that,&rdquo; laughed 
Norman. &ldquo;It's settled.&rdquo;  He took the money, gave it to 
the driver. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said to Tetlow. &ldquo;I'll pay 
you to-morrow   &mdash;   that is, later to-day   &mdash;   when you send 
me another check.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why should you pay for my cab?&rdquo; rejoined 
Tetlow. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Because it's easier for me to make money than it 
is for you,&rdquo; replied Norman. &ldquo;If you were in my 
position   &mdash;   the position I've been in for months   &mdash;   would 
anybody on earth give you three thousand dollars a 
month?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow looked sour. His good nature was rubbing 
thin in spots. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't lose your temper,&rdquo; laughed Norman. 
&ldquo;I'm pounding away at you about my superiority, 
partly because I've been drinking, but chiefly for your 
own good   &mdash;   so that you'll realize I'm right and not mess 
things with Galloway.&rdquo; 
</p><p>They went up to Norman's suite. Norman tried to 
unlock the door, found it already unlocked. He turned 
the knob, threw the door wide for Tetlow to enter first. 
Then, over Tetlow's shoulder he saw on the marble-topped center table Dorothy's hat and jacket, the one 
she had worn away, the only one she had. He stared 
at them, then at Tetlow. A confused look in the fat, 
slow face made him say sharply: 
</p><p>&ldquo;What does this mean, Tetlow?&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0384" n="359"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Not so loud, Fred,&rdquo; said Tetlow, closing the door 
into the public hall. &ldquo;She's in the bedroom   &mdash;   probably 
asleep. She's been here since yesterday.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You brought her back?&rdquo; demanded Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;She wanted to come. I simply   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman made a silencing gesture. Tetlow's faltering 
voice stopped short. Norman stood near the table, 
his hands deep in his trousers' pockets, his gaze fixed 
upon the hat and jacket. When Tetlow's agitation 
could bear the uncertainties of that silence no longer, 
he went on: 
</p><p>&ldquo;Fred, you mustn't forget how young and inexperienced 
she is. She's been foolish, but nothing more. 
She's as pure as when she came into the world. And 
it's the truth that she wanted to come back. I saw it 
as soon as I began to talk with her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What are you chattering about?&rdquo; said Norman 
fiercely. &ldquo;Why did you meddle in my affairs?  Why 
did you bring her back?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I knew she needed you,&rdquo; pleaded Tetlow. &ldquo;Then, 
too   &mdash;   I was afraid   &mdash;     I knew how you acted before, 
and I thought you'd not get your gait again until you 
had her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman gave a short sardonic laugh. &ldquo;If you'd 
only stop trying to understand me!&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>Tetlow was utterly confused. &ldquo;But, Fred, you 
don't realize   &mdash;   not all,&rdquo; he cried imploringly. &ldquo;She 
discovered   &mdash;   she thinks, I believe   &mdash;   that is   &mdash;   she   &mdash;   she 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0385" n="360"/>  
   &mdash;   that probably   &mdash;   that in a few months you'll be 
something more than a husband   &mdash;   and she something more 
than a wife   &mdash;   that you   &mdash;   that   &mdash;   you and she will be a 
father and a mother.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow's meaning slowly dawned on Norman. He 
seated himself in his favorite attitude, legs sprawled, 
fingers interlaced behind his head. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Wasn't I right to bring her back   &mdash;   to tell her she 
needn't fear to come?&rdquo; pleaded Tetlow. 
</p><p>Norman made no reply. After a brief silence he 
said:  &ldquo;Well, good night, old man. Come round to 
my office any time after ten.&rdquo;  He rose and gave 
Tetlow his hand. &ldquo;And arrange for Galloway whenever 
you like. Good night.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Tetlow hesitated. &ldquo;Fred   &mdash;   you'll not be harsh to 
her?&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>Norman smiled   &mdash;   a satirical smile, yet exquisitely 
gentle. &ldquo;If you <hi rend="italic">only</hi> wouldn't try to 
understand me, 
Bill,&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>When he was alone he sat lost in thought. At last 
he rang for a bell boy. And when the boy came, he 
said:  &ldquo;That door there&rdquo;   &mdash;   indicating one in the opposite 
wall of the sitting room   &mdash;   &ldquo;what does it lead 
into?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Another bedroom, sir.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Unlock it, and tell them at the office I wish that 
room added to my suite.&rdquo; 
</p><p>As soon as the additional bedroom was at his disposal, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0386" n="361"/>  
he went in and began to undress. When he had 
taken off coat and waistcoat he paused to telephone 
to the office a call for eight o'clock. As he finished and 
hung up the receiver, a sound from the direction of the 
sitting room made him glance in there. On the threshold 
of the other bedroom stood his wife. She was in 
her nightgown; her hair, done in a single thick braid, 
hung down across her bosom. There was in the room 
and upon her childish loveliness the strange commingling 
of lights and shadows that falls when the electricity 
is still on and the early morning light is pushing 
in at the windows. They looked at each other in 
silence for some time. If she was frightened or in the 
least embarrassed she did not show it. She simply 
looked at him, while ever so slowly a smile dawned   &mdash;    
a gleam in the eyes, a flutter round the lips, growing 
merrier and merrier. He did not smile. He continued 
to regard her gravely. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I heard you and Mr. Tetlow come in,&rdquo; she said. 
&ldquo;Then   &mdash;   you talked so long   &mdash;   I fell asleep again. I 
only this minute awakened.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Well, now you can go to sleep again,&rdquo; said he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I'm not a bit sleepy. What are you doing in 
that room ?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She advanced toward his door. He stood aside. 
She peeped in. She was so close to him that her nightgown 
brushed the bosom of his shirt. &ldquo;Another 
bedroom!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Just like ours.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0387" n="362"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;I didn't wish to disturb you,&rdquo; said he, calm and 
grave. 
</p><p>&ldquo;But you wouldn't have been disturbing me,&rdquo; 
protested she, leaning against the door frame, less than 
two feet away and directly facing him. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'll stay on here,&rdquo; said he. 
</p><p>She gazed at him with great puzzled eyes. &ldquo;Aren't 
you glad I'm back?&rdquo; she asked. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he with a polite smile. &ldquo;But I 
must get some sleep.&rdquo;  And he moved away. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You must let me tell you how I happened to go 
and why I came   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; he interrupted, looking at her with a 
piercing though not in the least unfriendly expression 
that made her grow suddenly pale and thoughtful. &ldquo;I 
do not wish to hear about it   &mdash;   not now   &mdash;   not ever. Tetlow 
told me all that it's necessary for me to know. 
You have come to stay, I assume?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   if&rdquo;   &mdash;   her lip quivered   &mdash;   &ldquo;if you'll let me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;There can be no question of that,&rdquo; said he with 
the same polite gravity he had maintained throughout. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You want me to leave you alone?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Please. I need sleep badly   &mdash;   and I've only three 
hours.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You are   &mdash;   angry with me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He looked placidly into her lovely, swimming eyes. 
&ldquo;Not in the least.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But how can you help being?  I acted dreadfully.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0388" n="363"/>  
</p><p>He smiled gently. &ldquo;But you are back   &mdash;   and the 
incident is closed.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She looked down at the carpet, her fingers playing 
with her braid, twisting and untwisting its strands. He 
stood waiting to close the door. She said, without 
lifting her eyes   &mdash;   said in a quiet, expressionless way, &ldquo;I 
have killed your love?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'll not trouble you any more,&rdquo; evaded he. And 
he laid his hand significantly upon the knob. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't understand,&rdquo; she murmured. Then, with 
a quick apologetic glance at him, &ldquo;But I'm very 
inconsiderate. You want to sleep. Good night.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said he, beginning to close the door. 
</p><p>She impulsively stood close before him, lifted her 
small white face, as if for a kiss. &ldquo;Do you forgive 
me?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I was foolish. I didn't understand 
   &mdash;   till I went back. Then   &mdash;   nothing was the same. And 
I knew I wasn't fitted for that life   &mdash;   and didn't really 
care for him   &mdash;   and   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>He kissed her on the brow. &ldquo;Don't agitate yourself,&rdquo; 
said he. &ldquo;And we will never speak of this again.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She shrank as if he had struck her. Her head 
drooped, and her shoulders. When she was clear of 
the door, he quietly closed it.</p>

<p>IT was not many minutes after ten when Tetlow 
hurried into Norman's office. &ldquo;Galloway's coming at 
eleven!&rdquo; said he, with an air of triumph. 
</p><p>&ldquo;So you mulled over what I said and decided that 
I was not altogether drunk?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn't sure of that,&rdquo; replied Tetlow. &ldquo;But I 
was afraid you'd be offended if I didn't try to get him. 
He gave me no trouble at all. As soon as I told him 
you'd be glad to see him at your office, he astounded me 
by saying he'd come.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;He and I have had dealings,&rdquo; said Norman. 
&ldquo;He understood at once. I always know my way when 
I'm dealing with a big man. It's only the little people 
that are muddled and complex. I hope you'll not forget 
this lesson, Billy.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I shan't,&rdquo; promised Tetlow. 
</p><p>&ldquo;We are to be partners,&rdquo; pursued Norman. &ldquo;We 
shall be intimately associated for years. You'll save 
me a vast amount of time and energy and yourself a 
vast amount of fuming and fretting, if you'll simply 
accept what I say, without discussion. When I want 
discussion I'll ask your advice.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0390" n="365"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm afraid you don't think it's worth much,&rdquo; said 
Tetlow humbly, &ldquo;and I guess it isn't.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;On the contrary, invaluable,&rdquo; declared Norman 
with flattering emphasis. &ldquo;Where you lack and I excel 
is in decision and action. I'll often get you to tell me 
what ought to be done, and then I'll make you do it   &mdash;    
which you'd never dare, by yourself.&rdquo; 
</p><p>At eleven sharp Galloway came, looking as nearly 
like a dangerous old eagle as a human being well could. 
Rapacious, merciless, tyrannical; a famous philanthropist. 
Stingy to pettiness; a giver away of millions. 
Rigidly honest, yet absolutely unscrupulous; faithful to 
the last letter of his given word, yet so treacherous where 
his sly mind could nose out a way to evade the spirit of 
his agreements that his name was a synonym for unfaithfulness. 
An assiduous and groveling snob, yet so militantly 
democratic that, unless his interest compelled, 
he would not employ any member of the &ldquo;best families&rdquo; 
in any important capacity. He seemed a bundle of 
contradictions. In fact he was profoundly consistent. 
That is to say, he steadily pursued in every thought 
and act the gratification of his two passions   &mdash;   wealth 
and power. He lost no seen opportunity, however 
shameful, to add to his fortune or to amuse himself 
with the human race, which he regarded with the 
unpitying contempt characteristic of every cold nature 
born or risen to success. 
</p><p>His theory of life   &mdash;   and it is the theory that explains 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0391" n="366"/>  
most great financial successes, however they may pretend 
or believe   &mdash;   his theory of life was that he did not 
need friends because the friends of a strong man weaken 
and rob him, but that he did need enemies because he 
could grow rich and powerful destroying and despoiling 
them. To him friends suggested the birds living in a 
tree. They might make the tree more romantic to the 
unthinking observer; but they in fact ate its budding 
leaves and its fruit and rotted its bough joints with 
their filthy nests. 
</p><p>We Americans are probably nearest to children of 
any race in civilization. The peculiar conditions of 
life   &mdash;   their almost Arcadian simplicity   &mdash;   up to a generation 
or so ago, gave us a false training in the study of 
human nature. We believe what the good preacher, the 
novelist and the poet, all as ignorant of life as nursery 
books, tell us about the human heart. We fancy that 
in a social system modeled upon the cruel and immoral 
system of Nature, success is to the good and kind. Life 
is like the pious story in the Sunday-school library; 
evil is the exception and to practice the simple virtues 
is to tread with sure step the highway to riches and 
fame. This sort of ignorance is taught, is proclaimed, 
is apparently accepted throughout the world. Literature 
and the drama, representing life as it is dreamed 
by humanity, life as it perhaps may be some day, create 
an impression which defies the plain daily and hourly 
mockings of experience. Because weak and petty offenders 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0392" n="367"/>  
are often punished, the universe is pictured as 
sternly enforcing the criminal codes enacted by priests 
or lawyers. But, while all the world half inclines to this 
agreeable mendacity about life, only in America of all 
civilization is the mendacity accepted as gospel, and 
suspicion about it frowned upon as the heresy of 
cynicism. So the Galloways prosper and are in high moral 
repute. Some day we shall learn that a social system 
which is merely a slavish copy of Nature's barbarous 
and wasteful sway of the survival of the toughest could 
be and ought to be improved upon by the intelligence 
of the human race. Some day we shall put Nature in 
its proper place as kindergarten teacher, and drop it 
from godship and erect enlightened human understanding 
instead. But that is a long way off. Meanwhile the 
Galloways will reign, and will assure us that they won 
their success by the Decalogue and the Golden Rule   &mdash;    
and will be believed by all who seek to assure for 
themselves in advance almost certain failure at material 
success in the arena of action. 
</p><p>But they will not be believed by men of ambition, 
pushing resolutely for power and wealth. So Frederick 
Norman knew precisely what he was facing when Galloway's 
tall gaunt figure and face of the bird of prey 
appeared before him. Galloway had triumphed and was 
triumphing not through obedience to the Sunday sermons 
and the silly novels, poems, plays, and the nonsense 
chattered by the obscure multitudes whom the 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0393" n="368"/>  
mighty few exploit, but through obedience to the 
conditions imposed by our social system. If he raised 
wages a little, it was in order that he might have 
excuse for raising prices a great deal. If he gave away 
millions, it was for his fame, and usually to quiet the 
scandal over some particularly wicked wholesale robbery. 
No, Galloway was not a witness to the might of altruistic 
virtue as a means to triumph. Charity and all the 
other forms of chicanery by which the many are 
defrauded and fooled by the few   &mdash;   those &ldquo;virtues&rdquo; he 
understood and practiced. But justice   &mdash;   humanity's 
ages-long dream that at last seems to glitter as a hope 
in the horizon of the future   &mdash;   justice   &mdash;   not legal justice, 
nor moral justice, but human justice   &mdash;   that idea would 
have seemed to him ridiculous, Utopian, something for 
the women and the children and the socialists. 
</p><p>Norman understood Galloway, and Galloway understood 
Norman. Galloway, with an old man's garrulity 
and a confirmed moral poseur's eagerness about appearances, 
began to unfold his virtuous reasons for the 
impending break with Burroughs   &mdash;   the industrial and 
financial war out of which he expected to come doubly 
rich and all but supreme. Midway he stopped. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You are not listening,&rdquo; said he sharply to the 
young man. 
</p><p>Their eyes met. Norman's eyes were twinkling. 
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am waiting.&rdquo; 
</p><p>There was the suggestion of an answering gleam of 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0394" n="369"/>  
sardonic humor in Galloway's cold gray eyes. &ldquo;Waiting 
for what?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;For you to finish with me as father confessor, to 
begin with me as lawyer. Pray don't hurry. My time 
is yours.&rdquo;  This with a fine air of utmost suavity and 
respect. 
</p><p>In fact, while Galloway was doddering on and on with 
his fake moralities, Norman was thinking of his own 
affairs, was wondering at his indifference about Dorothy. 
The night before   &mdash;   the few hours before   &mdash;   when he had 
dealt with her so calmly, he, even as he talked and 
listened and acted, had assumed that the enormous amount 
of liquor he had been consuming was in some way 
responsible. He had said to himself, &ldquo;When I am over 
this, when I have had sleep and return to the normal, I 
shall again be the foolish slave of all these months.&rdquo; 
But here he was, sober, having taken only enough 
whisky to prevent an abrupt let-down   &mdash;   here he was 
viewing her in the same tranquil light. No longer all 
his life; no longer even dominant; only a part of life   &mdash;    
and he was by no means certain that she was an important part. 
</p><p>How explain the mystery of the change?  Because 
she had voluntarily come back, did he feel that she was 
no longer baffling but was definitely his?  Or had passion 
running madly on and on dropped   &mdash;   perhaps not 
dead, but almost dead   &mdash;   from sheer exhaustion?   &mdash;   was 
it weary of racing and content to saunter and to stroll? 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0395" n="370"/>  
. . . He could not account for the change. He only 
knew that he who had been quite mad was now quite 
sane. . . . Would he like to be rid of her?  Did he 
regret that they were tied together?  No, curiously 
enough. It was high time he got married; she would 
do as well as another. She had beauty, youth, 
amiability, physical charm for him. There was advantage 
in the fact that her inferiority to him, her dependence 
on him, would enable him to take as much or as little of 
her as he might feel disposed, to treat her as the warrior 
must ever treat his entire domestic establishment 
from wife down to pet dog or cat or baby. . . . No, 
he did not regret Josephine. He could see now disadvantages 
greater than her advantages. All of value she 
would have brought him he could get for himself, and 
she would have been troublesome   &mdash;   exacting, disputing 
his sway, demanding full value or more in return for 
the love she was giving with such exalted notions of its 
worth. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You are married?&rdquo; Galloway suddenly said, 
interrupting his own speech and Norman's thought. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Just married, I believe?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Just.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Young and old, high and low, successful and failed, 
we are a race of advice-givers. As for Galloway, he 
was not one to neglect that showy form of inexpensive 
benevolence. &ldquo;Have plenty of children,&rdquo; said he. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0396" n="371"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;And keep your family in the country till they grow 
up. Town's no place for women. They go crazy. 
Women   &mdash;   and most men   &mdash;   have no initiative. They 
think only about whatever's thrust at them. In the 
country it'll be their children and domestic things. In 
town it'll be getting and spending money.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman was struck by this. &ldquo;I think I'll take your 
advice,&rdquo; said he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;A man's home ought to be a retreat, not an inn. 
We are humoring the women too much. They are 
forgetting who earns what they spend in exhibiting 
themselves. If a woman wants that sort of thing, let her 
get out and earn it. Why should she expect it from the 
man who has undertaken her support because he wanted 
a wife to take care of his house and a mother for his 
children?  If a woman doesn't like the job, all right. 
But if she takes it and accepts its pay, why, she should 
do its work.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Flawless logic,&rdquo; said Norman. 
</p><p>&ldquo;When I hire a man to work, he doesn't expect to 
idle about showing other people how handsome he is in 
the clothes my money pays for. Not that marriage is 
altogether a business   &mdash;   not at all. But, my dear sir   &mdash;   &rdquo; 
And Galloway brought his cane down with the emphasis 
of one speaking from a heart full of bitter experience   &mdash;    
&ldquo;unless it is a business at bottom, organized and 
conducted on sound business principles, there's no 
sentiment either. We are human beings   &mdash;   and that means 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0397" n="372"/>  
we are first of all <hi rend="italic">business</hi> beings, 
engaged in getting 
food, clothing, shelter. No sentiment   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">no</hi> sentiment, 
sir, is worth while that isn't firmly grounded. It's a 
house without a foundation. It's a steeple without a 
church under it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman looked at the old man with calm penetrating 
eyes. &ldquo;I shall conduct my married life on a sound, 
business basis, or not at all,&rdquo; said he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;We'll see,&rdquo; said Galloway. &ldquo;That's what <hi rend="italic">I</hi> said 
forty years ago   &mdash;     No, I didn't. I had no sense about 
such matters then. In my youth the men knew nothing 
about the woman question.&rdquo;  He smiled grimly. &ldquo;I 
see signs that they are learning.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Then as abruptly as he had left the affairs he was 
there to discuss he returned to them. His mind seemed 
to have freed itself of all irrelevancy and superfluity, as 
a stream often runs from a faucet with much spluttering 
and rather muddy at first, then steadies and clears. 
Norman gave him the attention one can get only from 
a good mind that is interested in the subject and 
understands it thoroughly. Such attention not merely 
receives the words and ideas as they fall from the mouth 
of him who utters them, but also seems to draw them 
by a sort of suction faster and in greater abundance. 
It was this peculiar ability of giving attention, as much 
as any other one quality, that gave Norman's clients 
their confidence in him. Galloway, than whom no man 
was shrewder judge of men, showed in his gratified eyes 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0398" n="373"/>  
and voice, long before he had finished, how strongly his 
conviction of Norman's high ability was confirmed. 
</p><p>When Galloway ended, Norman rapidly and in clear 
and simple sentences summarized what Galloway had 
said. &ldquo;That is right?&rdquo; he asked. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Galloway admiringly. &ldquo;What a 
gift of clear statement you have, young man!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It has won me my place,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;As to 
your campaign, I can tell you now that the legal part of 
it can be arranged. That is what the law is for   &mdash;   to 
enable a man to do whatever he wants. The penalties 
are for those who have the stupidity to try to do things 
in an unlawful way.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Galloway laughed. &ldquo;I had heard that they were 
for doing unlawful things.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing is unlawful,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;except in 
method.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's an interesting view of courts of justice.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But we have no courts of justice. We have only 
courts of law.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Galloway threw back his head and laughed till the 
tears rolled down his cheeks. &ldquo;What a gift for clear 
statement!&rdquo; he cried. 
</p><p>Norman beamed appreciation of a compliment so 
flattering. But he went back to business. &ldquo;As I was 
saying, you can do what you want to do. You wish 
me to show you how. In our modern way of doing 
things, the relation of lawyer and client has somewhat 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0399" n="374"/>  
changed. To illustrate by this case, you are the bear 
with the taste for honey and the strength to rob the 
bees. I am the honey bird   &mdash;   that is, the modern lawyer 
   &mdash;   who can show you the way to the hive. Most of the 
honey birds   &mdash;   as yet   &mdash;   are content with a very small 
share of the honey   &mdash;   whatever the bear happens to be 
unable to find room for. But I   &mdash;   &rdquo;  Norman's eyes 
danced and his strong mouth curved in a charming smile 
   &mdash;   &ldquo;I am a honey bird with a bear appetite.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Galloway was sitting up stiffly. &ldquo;I don't quite 
follow you, sir,&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yet I am plain enough. My ability at clear 
statement has not deserted me. If I show you the way 
through the tangled forest of the law to this hive you 
scent   &mdash;   I must be a partner in the honey.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Galloway rose. &ldquo;Your conceptions of your profession   &mdash;    
and of me, I may say   &mdash;   are not attractive. I 
have always been, and am willing and anxious to pay 
liberally   &mdash;   more liberally than anyone else   &mdash;   for legal 
advice. But my business, sir, is my own.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman rose, his expression one of apology and 
polite disappointment. &ldquo;I see I misunderstood your 
purpose in coming to me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Let us take no 
more of each other's time.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And what did you think my object was in coming?&rdquo; 
demanded Galloway. 
</p><p>&ldquo;To get from me what you realized you could get 
nowhere else   &mdash;   which meant, as an old experienced trader 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0400" n="375"/>  
like you must have known, that you were ready to pay 
my price. Of course, if you can get elsewhere the 
assistance you need, why, you would be most unwise to 
come to me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Galloway moved toward the door. &ldquo;And you 
might have charged practically any fee you wished,&rdquo; 
said he, laughing satirically. &ldquo;Young man, you are 
making the mistake that is ruining this generation. 
You wish to get rich all at once. You are not willing to 
be patient and to work and to build your fortune solidly 
and slowly.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman smiled as at a good joke. &ldquo;What an asset 
to you strong men has been the vague hope in the minds 
of the masses that each poor devil of them will have his 
turn to loot and grow rich. I used to think ignorance 
kept the present system going. But I have discovered 
that it is that sly, silly, corrupt hope. But, sir, it does 
not catch me. I shall not work for you and the other 
strong men, and patiently wait my turn that would 
never come. My time is <hi rend="italic">now</hi>.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You threaten me!&rdquo; cried Galloway furiously. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Threaten you?&rdquo; exclaimed Norman, amazed. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You think, because I have given you, my lawyer, 
my secrets, that you can compel me   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>With an imperious gesture Norman stopped him. 
&ldquo;Good day, sir,&rdquo; he said haughtily. &ldquo;Your secrets are 
safe with me. I am a lawyer, not a financier.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Galloway was disconcerted. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0401" n="376"/>  
Mr. Norman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I misunderstood you. I 
thought I heard you say in effect that you purposed to 
be rich, and that you purposed to compel me to make 
you so.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;So I did,&rdquo; replied Norman. &ldquo;But not by the 
methods you financiers are so adept at using. Not by 
high-class blackmail and blackjacking. I meant that 
my abilities were such that you and your fellow masters 
of modern society would be compelled to employ me on 
my own terms. A few moments ago you outlined to me 
a plan. It may be you can find other lawyers competent 
to steer it through the channel of the law. I doubt it. 
I may exaggerate my value. But   &mdash;   &rdquo;  He smiled 
pleasantly   &mdash;   &ldquo;I don't think so.&rdquo; 
</p><p>In this modern world of ours there is no more delicate 
or more important branch of the art of material success 
than learning to play one's own tune on the trumpets of 
fame. To those who watch careers intelligently and 
critically, and not merely with mouth agape and ears 
awag for whatever sounds the winds of credulity bear, 
there is keen interest in noting how differently this high 
art is practiced by the fame-seekers   &mdash;   how well some 
modest heroes disguise themselves before essaying the 
trumpet, how timidly some play, how brazenly others. 
It is an art of infinite variety. How many there are 
who can echo Shakespeare's sad lament, through Hamlet's 
lips   &mdash;   &ldquo;I lack advancement!&rdquo; Those are they 
who have wholly neglected, as did Shakespeare, this 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0402" n="377"/>  
essential part of the art of advancement   &mdash;   Shakespeare, 
who lived almost obscure and was all but forgotten for 
two centuries after his death. 
</p><p>Norman, frankly seeking mere material success, and 
with the colossal egotism that disdains egotism and 
shrugs at the danger of being accused of it   &mdash;   Norman 
did not hesitate to proclaim his own merits. He 
reasoned that he had the wares, that crying them would 
attract attention to them, that he whose attention was 
attracted, if he were a judge of wares and a seeker of 
the best, would see that the Norman wares were indeed 
as Norman cried them. At first blush Galloway was 
amused by Norman's candid self-esteem. But he had 
often heard of Norman's conceit   &mdash;   and in a long and 
busy life he had not seen an able man who was unaware 
of his ability; any more than he had seen a pretty 
woman unaware of her prettiness. So, at second blush, 
Galloway was tempted by Norman's calm strong blast 
upon his own trumpet to look again at the wares. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I always have had a high opinion of you, young 
man,&rdquo; said he, with laughing eyes. &ldquo;Almost as high an 
opinion as you have of yourself. Think over the legal 
side of my plan. When you get your thoughts in order, 
let me know   &mdash;   and make me a proposition as to your own 
share. Does that satisfy you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It's all I ask,&rdquo; said Norman. 
</p><p>And they parted on the friendliest terms   &mdash;   and 
Norman knew that his fortune was assured, if Galloway 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0403" n="378"/>  
lived another nine months. When he was alone, the 
sweat burst out upon him and, trembling from head to 
foot, he locked his door and flung himself at full length 
upon the rug. It was half an hour before the fit of 
silent hysterical reaction passed sufficiently to let him 
gather strength to rise. He tottered to his desk chair, 
and sat with his head buried in his arms upon the desk. 
After a while the telephone at his side rang insistently. 
He took the receiver in a hand he could not steady. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he called. 
</p><p>&ldquo;It's Tetlow. How'd you come out?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh   &mdash;   &rdquo;  He paused to stiffen his throat to attack 
the words naturally   &mdash;   &ldquo;all right. We go ahead.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;With G.?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly. But keep quiet. Don't let him know 
you've heard, if you see him or he sends for you. 
Remember, it's in my hands entirely.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me.&rdquo;  Tetlow's voice, suppressed and jubilant, 
suggested a fat, hoarse rooster trying to finish a 
crow before a coming stone from a farm boy reaches 
him. &ldquo;It seems natural and easy to you, old man. 
But I'm about crazy with joy. I'll come right over.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No. I'm going home.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Can't I see you there?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No. I've other matters to attend to. Come 
about lunch time to-morrow   &mdash;   to the office, here.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Tetlow disappointedly, and Norman 
rang off.</p>

<head>XX</head> 
<p>IN the faces of men who have dominion of whatever 
kind over their fellow men   &mdash;   be it the brutal rule of the 
prize fighter over his gang or the apparently gentle 
sway of the apparently meek bishop over his loving 
flock   &mdash;   in the faces of all men of power there is a 
dangerous look. They may never lose their tempers. 
They may never lift their voices. They may be ever 
suave and civil. The dangerous look is there   &mdash;   and the 
danger behind it. And the sense of that look and of 
its cause has a certain restraining effect upon all but 
the hopelessly impudent or solidly dense. Norman was 
one of the men without fits of temper. In his moments 
of irritation, no one ever felt that a storm of violent 
language might be impending. But the danger signal 
flaunted from his face. Danger of what?  No one could 
have said. Most people would have laughed at the idea 
that so even tempered a man, pleased with himself and 
with the world, could ever be dangerous. Yet everyone 
had instinctively respected that danger flag   &mdash;   until 
Dorothy. 
</p><p>Perhaps it had struck for her   &mdash;   had really not been 
there when she looked at him. Perhaps she had been 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0405" n="380"/>  
too inexperienced, perhaps too self-centered, to see it. 
Perhaps she had never before seen his face in an hour 
of weariness and relaxation   &mdash;   when the true character, 
the dominating and essential trait or traits, shows 
nakedly upon the surface, making the weak man or woman 
look pitiful, the strong man or woman formidable. 
</p><p>However that may be, when he walked into the sitting 
room, greeted her placidly and kissed her on the 
brow, she, glancing uncertainly up at him, saw that 
danger signal for the first time. She studied his face, 
her own face wearing her expression of the puzzled 
child. No, not quite that expression as it always had 
been theretofore, but a modified form of it. To any 
self-centered, self-absorbed woman   &mdash;   there comes in her 
married life, unless she be married to a booby, a time, 
an hour, a moment even   &mdash;   for it can be narrowed down 
to a point   &mdash;   when she takes her first <hi rend="italic">seeing</hi> look at the 
man upon whom she is dependent for protection, whether 
spiritual or material, or both. In her egotism and 
vanity she has been regarding him as her property. 
Suddenly, and usually disagreeably, it has been revealed 
to her that she is his property. That hour had come 
for Dorothy Norman. And she was looking at her husband, 
was wondering who and what he was. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You've had your lunch?&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You have been out for the air?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0406" n="381"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You didn't tell me what to do.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He smiled good humoredly. &ldquo;Oh, you had no 
money.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   a little. But I   &mdash;   &rdquo;  She halted. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You hadn't told me what to do,&rdquo; she repeated, as 
if on mature thought that sentence expressed the whole 
matter. 
</p><p>He felt in his pockets, found a small roll of bills. 
He laid twenty-five dollars on the table. &ldquo;I'll keep 
thirty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as I shan't have any more till I see 
Tetlow to-morrow. Now, fly out and amuse yourself. 
I'm going to sleep. Don't wake me till you're ready 
for dinner.&rdquo; 
</p><p>And he went into his bedroom and closed the door. 
When he awoke, he saw that it was dark outside, and 
some note in the din of street noises from far below 
made him feel that it was late. He wrapped a bathrobe  
round him, opened the door into the sitting room. 
It was dark. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Dorothy!&rdquo; he called. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; promptly responded the small quiet voice, 
so near that he started back. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and switched on the light. 
&ldquo;There you are   &mdash;   by the window. What were you doing, 
in the dark?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was dressed precisely as when he had last seen 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0407" n="382"/>  
her. She was sitting with her hands listless in her lap 
and her face a moving and beautiful expression of 
melancholy dreams. On the table were the bills   &mdash;   where 
he had laid them. &ldquo;You've been out?&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've been   &mdash;   waiting.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; laughed he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;For   &mdash;   I don't know,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Just 
waiting.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But there's nothing to wait for.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She looked at him interrogatively. &ldquo;No   &mdash;   I suppose 
not,&rdquo; she said. 
</p><p>He went back into his room and glanced at his watch. 
&ldquo;Eleven o'clock!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why didn't you wake 
me?  You must be nearly starved.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I am hungry,&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>Her patient, passive resignation irritated him. &ldquo;I'm 
ravenous,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll dress   &mdash;   and you dress, too. 
We'll go downstairs to supper.&rdquo; 
</p><p>When he reappeared in the sitting room, in a dinner 
jacket, she was again seated near the window, hands 
listless in her lap and eyes gazing dreamily into vacancy. 
But she was now dressed in the black chiffon and the 
big black hat. He laughed. &ldquo;You are prompt and 
obedient,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Nothing like hunger to subdue.&rdquo; 
</p><p>A faint flush tinged her lovely skin; the look of the 
child that has been struck appeared in her eyes. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0408" n="383"/>  
</p><p>He cast about in his mind for the explanation. Did 
she think he meant it was need that had brought her 
meekly back to him?  That was true enough, but he 
had not intended to hint it. In high good humor 
because he was so delightfully hungry and was about 
to get food, he cried:  &ldquo;Do cheer up!  There's nothing 
to be sad about   &mdash;   nothing.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She lifted her large eyes and gazed at him timidly. 
&ldquo;What are you going to do with me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Take you downstairs and feed you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I mean   &mdash;   afterward?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Bring   &mdash;   or send   &mdash;   you up here to go to bed.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going away?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Away from me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He looked at her with amused eyes. She was 
exquisitely lovely; never had he seen her lovelier. It 
delighted him to note her charms   &mdash;   the charms that had 
enslaved him   &mdash;   not a single charm missing   &mdash;   and to feel 
that he was no longer their slave, was his own master 
again. 
</p><p>A strange look swept across her uncannily mobile 
face   &mdash;   a look of wonder, of awe, of fear, of dread. 
&ldquo;You don't even like me any more,&rdquo; she said in her 
colorless way. 
</p><p>&ldquo;What have I done to make you think I dislike 
you?&rdquo; said he pleasantly. 
</p><p>She gazed down in silence. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0409" n="384"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;You need have no fear,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You are my 
wife. You will be well taken care of, and you will not 
be annoyed. What more can I say?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she murmured. 
</p><p>He winced. She had made him feel like an unpleasant 
cross between an alms-giver and a bully. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; 
said he, with forced but resolute cheerfulness, &ldquo;we will 
eat, drink and be merry.&rdquo; 
</p><p>On the way down in the elevator he watched her 
out of the corner of his eye. When they reached the 
hall leading to the supper room he touched her arm 
and halted her. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said he in the pleasant 
voice which yet somehow never failed to secure attention 
and obedience, &ldquo;there will be some of my acquaintances 
in there at supper. I don't want them to see you 
with that whipped dog look. There's no occasion for it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her lip trembled. &ldquo;I'll do my best,&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Let's see you smile,&rdquo; laughed he. &ldquo;You have 
often shown me that you know the woman's trick of 
wearing what feelings you choose on the outside. So 
don't pretend that you've got to look as if you were 
about to be hung for a crime you didn't commit. 
There!   &mdash;   that's better.&rdquo; 
</p><p>And indeed to a casual glance she looked the happy 
bride trying   &mdash;   not very successfully   &mdash;   to seem used to 
her husband and her new status. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Hold it!&rdquo; he urged gayly. &ldquo;I've no fancy for 
leading round a lovely martyr in chains. Especially as 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0410" n="385"/>  
you're about as healthy and well placed a person as I 
know. And you'll feel as well as you look when you've 
had something to eat.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Whether it was obedience or the result of a decision 
to drop an unprofitable pose he could not tell, but as 
soon as they were seated and she had a bill of fare before 
her and was reading it, her expression of happiness lost 
its last suggestion of being forced. &ldquo;Crab meat!&rdquo; she 
said. &ldquo;I love it!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Two portions of crab meat,&rdquo; he said to the waiter 
with pad and pencil at attention. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I don't want that much,&rdquo; she protested. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You forget that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am 
hungry,&rdquo; rejoined he. 
&ldquo;And when I am hungry, the price of food begins to 
go up.&rdquo;  He addressed himself to the waiter:  &ldquo;After 
that a broiled grouse   &mdash;   with plenty of hominy   &mdash;   and 
grilled sweet potatoes   &mdash;   and a salad of endive and hot-house tomatoes   &mdash;   and I know the difference between hot-house tomatoes and the other kinds. Next   &mdash;   some 
cheese   &mdash;   Coullomi&agrave;res   &mdash;   yes, you have it   &mdash;   I got the 
steward to get it   &mdash;   and toasted crackers   &mdash;   the round 
kind, not the square   &mdash;   and not the hard ones that 
unsettle the teeth   &mdash;   and   &mdash;   what kind of ice, my dear?   &mdash;   or 
would you prefer a fresh peach flambee?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   I think so,&rdquo; said Dorothy. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You hear, waiter?   &mdash;   and a bottle of   &mdash;   there's the 
head waiter   &mdash;   ask him   &mdash;   he knows the champagne I 
like.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0411" n="386"/>  
</p><p>As Norman had talked, in the pleasant, insistent 
voice, the waiter had roused from the air of mindless, 
mechanical sloth characteristic of the New York 
waiter   &mdash;   unless and until a fee below his high expectation 
is offered. When he said the final &ldquo;very good, 
sir,&rdquo; it was with the accent of real intelligence. 
</p><p>Dorothy was smiling, with the amusement of youth 
and inexperience. &ldquo;What a lot of trouble you took 
about it,&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Anything worth doing 
at all is worth taking trouble about. You will see. 
We shall get results. The supper will be the best this 
house can put together.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You can have anything you want in this world, 
if you only can pay for it,&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's what most people think,&rdquo; replied he. 
&ldquo;But the truth is, the paying is only a small part of 
the art of getting what one wants.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She glanced nervously at him. &ldquo;I'm beginning to 
realize that I'm dreadfully inexperienced,&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;There's nothing discouraging in that,&rdquo; said he. 
&ldquo;Lack of experience can be remedied. But not lack 
of judgment. It takes the great gift of judgment to 
enable one to profit by mistakes, to decide what is the 
real lesson of an experience.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm afraid I haven't any judgment, either,&rdquo; 
confessed she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0412" n="387"/>  
</p><p>She hesitated   &mdash;   ventured:  &ldquo;What do you think is 
my worst fault?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He shook his head laughingly. &ldquo;We are going to 
have a happy supper.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think I am very vain?&rdquo; persisted she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Who's been telling you so?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Tetlow. He gave me an awful talking to, 
just before I   &mdash;   &rdquo;  She paused at the edge of the 
forbidden ground. &ldquo;He didn't spare me,&rdquo; she went on. 
&ldquo;He said I was a vain, self-centered little fool.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And what did you say?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I was very angry. I told him he had no right 
to accuse me of that. I reminded him that he had never 
heard me say a word about myself.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And did he say that the vainest people were just 
that way   &mdash;   never speaking of themselves, never thinking 
of anything else?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, he told you what he said,&rdquo; cried she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; laughed he. 
</p><p>She reddened. &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">You</hi> think I'm 
vain?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He made a good-humoredly satirical little bow. &ldquo;I 
think you are charming,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It would be a 
waste of time to look at or to think of anyone else when 
oneself is the most charming and interesting person in 
the world. Still   &mdash;   &rdquo;  He put into his face and voice a 
suggestion of gravity that caught her utmost attention   &mdash;    
&ldquo;if one is to get anywhere, is to win consideration 
from others   &mdash;   and happiness for oneself   &mdash;   one simply 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0413" n="388"/>  
must do a little thinking about others   &mdash;   occasionally.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her eyes lowered. A faint color tinged her cheeks. 
</p><p>&ldquo;The reason most of us are so uncomfortable   &mdash;    
downright unhappy most of the time   &mdash;   is that we never 
really take our thoughts off our precious fascinating 
selves. The result is that some day we find that the 
liking   &mdash;   and friendship   &mdash;   and love   &mdash;   of those around us 
has limits   &mdash;   and we are left severely alone. Of course, 
if one has a great deal of money, one can buy excellent 
imitations of liking and friendship and even love   &mdash;   I 
ought to say, especially love   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>The color flamed in her face. 
</p><p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;if one is in modest circumstances 
or poor, one has to take care.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Or dependent,&rdquo; she said, with one of those unexpected 
flashes of subtle intelligence that so complicated 
the study of her character. He had been talking to 
amuse himself rather than with any idea of her 
understanding. Her sudden bright color and her two 
words   &mdash;   &ldquo;or dependent&rdquo;   &mdash;   roused him to see that she 
thought he was deliberately giving her a savage 
lecture from the cover of general remarks. &ldquo;With the 
vanity of the typical woman,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;she 
always imagines <hi rend="italic">she</hi> is the subject of 
everyone's thought 
and talk.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Or dependent,&rdquo; said he to her, easily. &ldquo;I wasn't 
thinking of you, but yours <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a case 
in point. Come, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0414" n="389"/>  
now   &mdash;   nothing to look blue about!  Here's something 
to eat. No, it's for the next table.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You won't let me explain,&rdquo; she protested, between 
the prudence of reproach and the candor of anger. 
</p><p>&ldquo;There's nothing to explain,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;Don't 
bother about the mistakes of yesterday. Remember 
them   &mdash;   yes. If one has a good memory, to forget is 
impossible   &mdash;   not to say unwise. But there ought to 
be no more heat or sting in the memory of past mistakes 
than in the memory of last year's mosquito bites.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The first course of the supper arrived. Her 
nervousness vanished, and he got far away from the 
neighborhood of the subjects that, even in remotest hint, 
could not but agitate her. And as the food and the 
wine asserted their pacific and beatific sway, she and 
he steadily moved into better and better humor with 
each other. Her beauty grew until it had him thinking 
that never, not in the most spiritual feminine conceptions 
of the classic painters, had he seen a loveliness 
more ethereal. Her skin was so exquisite, the coloring 
of her hair and eyes and of her lips was so delicately 
fine that it gave her the fragility of things bordering 
upon the supernal   &mdash;   of rare exotics, of sunset and 
moonbeam effects. No, he had been under no spell of 
illusion as to her beauty. It was a reality   &mdash;   the more 
fascinating because it waxed and waned not with 
regularity of period but capriciously. 
</p><p>He began to look round furtively, to see what effect 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0415" n="390"/>  
this wife of his was producing on others. These last 
few months, through prudence as much as through 
pride, he had been cultivating the habit of ignoring his 
surroundings; he would not invite cold salutations or 
obvious avoidance of speaking. He now discovered 
many of his former associates   &mdash;   and his vanity dilated 
as he noted how intensely they were interested in his 
wife. 
</p><p>Some men of ability have that purest form of egotism 
which makes one profoundly content with himself, 
genuinely indifferent to the approval or the disapproval 
of others. Norman's vanity had a certain amount 
of alloy. He genuinely disdained his fellow-men   &mdash;   their 
timidity, their hypocrisy, their servility, their limited 
range of ideas. He was indifferent to the verge of 
insensibility as to their adverse criticism. But at the 
same time it was necessary to his happiness that he get 
from them evidences of their admiration and envy. 
With that amusing hypocrisy which tinges all human 
nature, he concealed from himself the satisfaction, the 
joy even, he got out of the showy side of his position. 
And no feature of his infatuation for Dorothy 
surprised him so much as the way it rode rough shod and 
reckless over his snobbishness. 
</p><p>With the fading of infatuation had come many 
reflections upon the practical aspects of what he had 
done. It pleased him with himself to find that, in this 
first test, he had not the least regret, but on the contrary 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0416" n="391"/>  
a genuine pride in the courageous independence 
he had shown   &mdash;   another and strong support to his 
conviction of his superiority to his fellow-men. He might 
be somewhat snobbish   &mdash;   who was not?   &mdash;   who else in his 
New York was less than supersaturated with snobbishness? 
But snobbishness, the determining quality in the 
natures of all the women and most of the men he knew, 
had shown itself one of the incidental qualities in his 
own nature. After all, reflected he, it took a man, a 
good deal of a man, to do what he had done, and not 
to regret it, even in the hour of disillusionment. And 
it must be said for this egotistic self-approval of his 
that like all his judgments there was sound merit of 
truth in it. The vanity of the nincompoop is ridiculous. 
The vanity of the man of ability is amusing and no 
doubt due to a defective point of view upon the proportions 
of the universe; but it is not without excuse, and 
those who laugh might do well to discriminate even as 
they guffaw. 
</p><p>Looking discreetly about, Norman was suddenly 
confronted by the face of Josephine Burroughs, only 
two tables away. 
</p><p>Until their eyes squarely met he did not know she 
was there, or even in America. Before he could make a 
beginning of glancing away, she gave him her sweetest 
smile and her friendliest bow. And Dorothy, looking 
to see to whom he was speaking, was astonished to 
receive the same radiance of cordiality. Norman was 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0417" n="392"/>  
pleased at the way his wife dealt with the situation. 
She returned both bow and smile in her own quiet, 
slightly reserved way of gentle dignity. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Who was that, speaking?&rdquo; asked she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Burroughs. You must remember her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He noted it as characteristic that she said, quite 
sincerely:  &ldquo;Oh, so it is. I didn't remember her. That 
is the girl you were engaged to.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   `the nice girl uptown,' &rdquo; said he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I didn't like her,&rdquo; said Dorothy, with evident 
small interest in the subject. &ldquo;She was vain.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You mean you didn't like her way of being vain,&rdquo; 
suggested Norman. &ldquo;Everyone is vain; so, if we disliked 
for vanity we should dislike everyone.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it was her way. And just now she spoke to 
us both, as if she were doing us a favor.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Gracious, it's called,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What of it?  It 
does us no harm and gives her about the only happiness 
she's got.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman, without seeming to do so, noted the rest 
of the Burroughs party. At Josephine's right sat a 
handsome young foreigner, and it took small experience 
of the world to discover that he was paying court to 
her, and that she was pleased and flattered. Norman 
asked the waiter who he was, and learned that he came 
from the waiter's own province of France, was the Duc 
de Vald&ocirc;me. At first glance Norman had thought him 
distinguished. Afterward he discriminated. There are 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0418"/>  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0419"/>
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0420" n="393"/>  
several kinds or degrees of distinction. There is 
distinction of race, of class, of family, of dress, of person. 
As Frenchman, as aristocrat, as a scion of the ancient 
family of Vald&ocirc;me, as a specimen of tailoring and valeting, 
Miss Burroughs's young man was distinguished. 
But in his own proper person he was rather insignificant. 
The others at the table were Americans. Following Miss 
Burroughs's cue, they sought an opportunity to speak 
friendlily to Norman   &mdash;   and he gave it them. His 
acknowledgment of those effusive salutations was polite 
but restrained. 
</p><p>&ldquo;They are friends of yours?&rdquo; said Dorothy. 
</p><p>&ldquo;They were,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And they may be again   &mdash;    
when they are friends of <hi rend="italic">ours</hi>.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm not very good at making friends,&rdquo; she warned 
him. &ldquo;I don't like many people.&rdquo;  This time her 
unconscious and profound egotism pleased him. Evidently 
it did not occur to her that she should be eager 
to be friends with those people on any terms, that the 
only question was whether they would receive her. 
</p><p>She asked:  &ldquo;Why was Miss   &mdash;   Miss Burroughs so 
friendly?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why shouldn't she be?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I thought you threw her over.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He winced at this crude way of putting it. &ldquo;On 
the contrary, she threw me over.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Dorothy laughed incredulously. &ldquo;I know better. 
Mr. Tetlow told me.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0421" n="394"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;She threw me over,&rdquo; repeated he coldly. &ldquo;Tetlow 
was repeating malicious and ignorant gossip.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Dorothy laughed again   &mdash;   it was her second glass of 
champagne. &ldquo;You say that because it's the honorable 
thing to say. But I know.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I say it because it's true,&rdquo; said he. 
</p><p>He spoke quietly, but if she had drunk many more 
than two glasses of an unaccustomed and heady liquor 
she would have felt his intonation. She paled and 
shrank and her slim white fingers fluttered nervously 
at the collar of her dress. &ldquo;I was only joking,&rdquo; she 
murmured. 
</p><p>He laughed good-naturedly. &ldquo;Don't look as if I 
had given you a whipping,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Surely you're 
not afraid of me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She glanced shyly at him, a smile dancing in her 
eyes and upon her lips. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. And after a 
pause she added:  &ldquo;I didn't used to be. But that was 
because I didn't know you   &mdash;   or much of anything.&rdquo; 
The smile irradiated her whole face. &ldquo;You used to be 
afraid of me. But you aren't, any more.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, looking straight at her. &ldquo;No, I'm 
not.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I always told you you were mistaken in what you 
thought of me. I really don't amount to much. A man 
as serious and as important as you are couldn't   &mdash;    
couldn't care about me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It's true you don't amount to much, as yet,&rdquo; said 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0422" n="395"/>  
he. &ldquo;And if you never do amount to much, you'd be no 
less than most women and most men. But I've an idea 
   &mdash;   at times   &mdash;   that you <hi rend="italic">could</hi> amount to 
something.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He saw that he had wounded her vanity, that her 
protestations of humility were precisely what he had 
suspected. He laughed at her:  &ldquo;I see you thought I'd 
contradict you. But I can't afford to be so amiable 
now. And the first thing you've got to get rid of is 
the part of your vanity that prevents you from growing. 
Vanity of belief in one's possibilities is fine. No 
one gets anywhere without it. But vanity of belief in 
one's present perfection   &mdash;   no one but a god could afford 
that luxury.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Observing her closely he was amused   &mdash;   and pleased 
   &mdash;   to note that she was struggling to compose herself to 
endure his candors as a necessary part of the duties and 
obligations she had taken on herself when she gave up 
and returned to him. 
</p><p>&ldquo;What <hi rend="italic">you</hi> thought of <hi rend="italic">me</hi> used to be the important 
thing in our relations,&rdquo; he went on, in his way of raillery 
that took all or nearly all the sting out of what he said, 
but none of its strength. &ldquo;Now, the important thing 
is what I think of you. You are much younger than 
I, especially in experience. You are going to school to 
life with me as teacher. You'll dislike the teacher for 
the severity of the school. That isn't just, but it's 
natural   &mdash;   perhaps inevitable. And please   &mdash;   my dear   &mdash;    
when you are bitterest over what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> 
have to put up 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0423" n="396"/>  
with from <hi rend="italic">me</hi>   &mdash;   don't forget what <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have to put up with 
from <hi rend="italic">you</hi>.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was fighting bravely against angry tears. As 
for him, he had suddenly become indifferent to what 
the people around them might be thinking. With all 
his old arrogance come back in full flood, he was feeling 
that he would live his own life in his own way and that 
those who didn't approve   &mdash;   yes, including Dorothy   &mdash;    
might do as they saw fit. She said: 
</p><p>&ldquo;I don't blame you for regretting that you didn't 
marry Miss Burroughs.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I don't regret it,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;On the 
contrary, I'm glad.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She glanced hopefully at him. But the hopeful 
expression faded as he went on: 
</p><p>&ldquo;Whether or not I made a mistake in marrying you, 
I certainly had an escape from disaster when she 
decided she preferred a foreigner and a title. There's a 
good sensible reason why so many girls of her class   &mdash;    
more and more all the time   &mdash;   marry abroad. They are 
not fit to be the wives of hard-working American 
husbands. In fact I've about reached the conclusion that 
of the girls growing up nowdays very few in any class 
are fit to be American wives. They're not big enough. 
They're too coarse and crude in their tastes. They're 
only fit for the shallow, showy sort of thing   &mdash;   and the 
European aristocracy is their hope   &mdash;   and their place.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Her small face had a fascinating expression of a 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0424" n="397"/>  
 
 
 
child trying to understand things far beyond its depth. 
He was interested in his own thoughts, however, and 
went on   &mdash;   for, if he had been in the habit of stopping 
when his hearers failed to understand, or when they 
misunderstood, either he would have been silent most 
of the time in company or his conversation would have 
been as petty and narrow and devoid of originality or 
imagination as is the mentality of most human beings 
   &mdash;   as is the talk and reading that impress them as 
interesting   &mdash;   and profound! 
</p><p>&ldquo;The American man of the more ambitious sort,&rdquo; 
he went on, &ldquo;either has to live practically if not 
physically apart from his wife or else has to educate some 
not too difficult woman to be his wife.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She understood that. &ldquo;You are really going to 
educate me?&rdquo; she said, with an arch smile. Now that 
Norman had her attention, now that she was centering 
upon him instead of upon herself, she was interested 
in him, and in what he said, whether she understood 
it or not, whether it pleased her vanity or wounded 
it. The intellects of women work to an unsuspected 
extent only through the sex charm. Their appreciations 
of books, of art, of men are dependant, often in 
the most curious indirect ways, upon the fact that 
the author, the artist, the politician or what not is 
betrousered. Thus, Dorothy was patient, respectful, 
attentive, was not offended by Norman's didactic 
way of giving her the lessons in life. Her smile was 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0425" n="398"/>  
happy as well as coquettish, as she asked him to educate her. 
</p><p>He returned her smile. &ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; answered 
he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You're not sure I'm worth the trouble?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You may put it that way, if you like. But I'd 
say, rather, I'm not sure I can spare the time   &mdash;   and 
you're not sure you care to fit yourself for the place.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, but I do!&rdquo; cried she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;We'll see   &mdash;   in a few weeks or months,&rdquo; replied he. 
</p><p>The Burroughs party were rising. Josephine had 
choice of two ways to the door. She chose the one 
that took her past Norman and his bride. She 
advanced, beaming. Norman rose, took her extended 
hand. Said she: 
</p><p>&ldquo;So glad to see you.&rdquo;  Then, turning the radiant 
smile upon Dorothy, &ldquo;And is this your wife?  Is this 
the pretty little typewriter girl?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Dorothy nodded   &mdash;   a charming, ingenuous bend of 
the head. Norman felt a thrill of pride in her, so 
beautifully unconscious of the treacherous attempt at insult. 
It particularly delighted him that she had not made 
the mistake of rising to return Josephine's greeting but 
had remained seated. Surely this wife of his had the 
right instincts that never fail to cause right manners. 
For Josephine's benefit, he gazed down at Dorothy with 
the proudest, fondest eyes. &ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   this is she,&rdquo; said 
he. &ldquo;Can you blame me?&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0426" n="399"/>  
</p><p>Josephine paled and winced visibly, as if the blow 
she had aimed at him had, after glancing off harmlessly, 
returned to crush her. She touched Dorothy's proffered 
hand, murmured a few stammering phrases of vague 
compliment, rejoined her friends. Said Dorothy, when 
she and Norman were settled again: 
</p><p>&ldquo;I shall never like her. Nor she me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But you do like this cheese?  Waiter, another 
bottle of that same.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why did she put you in such a good humor?&rdquo; 
inquired his wife. 
</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn't she. It was you!&rdquo; replied he. But he 
refused to explain.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="21" id="d27"> 
<head>XXI</head> 
<p>GALLOWAY accepted Norman's terms. He would 
probably have accepted terms far less easy. But Norman 
as yet knew with the thoroughness which must 
precede intelligent plan and action only the legal side 
of financial operations; he had been as indifferent to 
the commercial side as a pilot to the value of the cargo 
in the ship he engages to steer clear of shoals and rocks. 
So with the prudence of the sagacious man's audacities 
he contented himself with a share of this first venture 
that would simply make a comfortable foundation for 
the fortune he purposed to build. As the venture could 
not fail outright, even should Galloway die, he rented 
a largish place at Hempstead, with the privilege of 
purchase, and installed his wife and himself with a dozen 
servants and a housekeeper. 
</p><p>&ldquo;This housekeeper, this Mrs. Lowell,&rdquo; said he to 
Dorothy, &ldquo;is a good enough person as housekeepers 
go. But you will have to look sharply after her.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Dorothy seemed to fade and shrink within herself, 
which was her way of confessing lack of courage and 
fitness to face a situation:  &ldquo;I don't know anything 
about those things,&rdquo; she confessed. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0428" n="401"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;I understand perfectly,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But you 
learned something at the place in Jersey City   &mdash;   quite 
enough for the start. Really, all you need to know 
just now is whether the place is clean or not, and 
whether the food comes on the table in proper condition. 
The rest you'll pick up gradually.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said she, looking doubtful and helpless; 
these new magnitudes were appalling, especially 
now that she was beginning to get a point of view upon 
life. 
</p><p>&ldquo;At any rate, don't bother me for these few next 
months,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I'm going to be very busy   &mdash;   shall 
leave early in the morning and not be back until near 
dinner time   &mdash;   if I come at all. No, you'll not be 
annoyed by me. You'll be absolute mistress of your time.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She tried to look as if this contented her. But he 
could not have failed to see how dissatisfied and 
disquieted she really was. He had the best of reasons for 
thinking that she was living under the same roof with 
him only because she preferred the roof he could provide 
to such a one as she could provide for herself whether 
by her own earnings or by marrying a man more to her 
liking personally. Yet here she was, piqued and 
depressed because of his indifference   &mdash;   because he was not 
thrusting upon her gallantries she would tolerate only 
through prudence! 
</p><p>&ldquo;You will be lonely at times, I'm afraid,&rdquo; said he. 
&ldquo;But I can't provide friends or even acquaintances for 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0429" n="402"/>  
you for several months   &mdash;   until my affairs are in better 
order and my sister and her husband come back from 
Europe.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I shan't be lonely,&rdquo; cried she. &ldquo;I've never 
cared for people.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You've your books, and your music   &mdash;   and riding 
   &mdash;   and shopping trips to town   &mdash;   and the house and 
grounds to look after.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes   &mdash;   and my dreams,&rdquo; said she hopefully, her 
eyes suggesting the dusky star depths. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh   &mdash;   the dreams. You'll have little time for them,&rdquo; 
said he drily. &ldquo;And little inclination, I imagine, as 
you wake up to the sense of how much there is to be 
learned. Dreaming is the pastime of people who haven't 
the intelligence or the energy to accomplish anything. 
If you wish to please me   &mdash;   and you do   &mdash;   don't you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she murmured. She forced her rebellious 
lips to the laconic assent. She drooped the lids over 
her rebellious eyes, lest he should detect her wounded 
feelings and her resentment. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I assumed so,&rdquo; said he, with a secret smile. 
&ldquo;Well, if you wish to please me, you'll give your time 
to practical things   &mdash;   things that'll make you more 
interesting and make us both more comfortable. It was 
all very well to dream, while you had little to do and 
small opportunity. But now   &mdash;     Try to cut it out.&rdquo; 
</p><p>It is painful to an American girl of any class to 
find that she has to earn her position as wife. The 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0430" n="403"/>  
current theory, a tradition from an early and woman-revering day, is that the girl has done her share and 
more when she has consented to the suit of the ardent 
male and has intrusted her priceless charms to his 
exclusive keeping. According to that same theory, it is 
the husband who must earn his position   &mdash;   must continue 
to earn it. He is a humble creature, honored by the 
presence of a wonderful being, a cross between a queen 
and a goddess. He cannot do enough to show his 
gratitude. Perhaps   &mdash;   but only perhaps   &mdash;   had Norman 
married Josephine Burroughs, he might have assented, 
after a fashion, to this idea of the relations of the man 
and the woman. No doubt, had he remained under the 
spell of Dorothy's mystery and beauty, he would have 
felt and acted the slave he had made of himself at the 
outset. But in the circumstances he was looking at 
their prospective life together with sane eyes. And 
so she had, in addition to all her other reasons for 
heartache, a sense that she, the goddess-queen, the 
American woman, with the birthright of dominion over 
the male, was being cheated, humbled, degraded. 
</p><p>At first he saw that this sense of being wronged 
made it impossible for her to do anything at all toward 
educating herself for her position. But time brought 
about the change he had hoped for. A few weeks, and 
she began to cheer up, almost in spite of herself. What 
was the use in sulking or sighing or in self-pitying, 
when it brought only unhappiness to oneself?  The 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0431" n="404"/>  
coarse and brutal male in the case was either unaware 
or indifferent. There was no one and no place to fly 
to   &mdash;   unless she wished to be much worse off than her 
darkest mood of self-pity represented her to her 
sorrowing self. The housekeeper, Mrs. Lowell, was a 
&ldquo;broken down gentlewoman&rdquo; who had been chastened 
by misfortune into a wholesome state of practical good 
sense about the relative values of the real and the 
romantic. Mrs. Lowell diagnosed the case of the young 
wife   &mdash;   as Norman had shrewdly guessed she would   &mdash;    
and was soon adroitly showing her the many advantages 
of her lot. Before they had been three months at 
Hempstead, Dorothy had discovered that she, in fact, 
was without a single ground for serious complaint. She 
had a husband who was generous about money, and left 
her as absolutely alone as if he were mere occasional 
visitor at the house. She had her living   &mdash;   and such a 
living!   &mdash;   she had plenty of interesting occupation   &mdash;   she 
had not a single sordid care   &mdash;   and perfect health. 
</p><p>The dreams, too   &mdash;     It was curious about those 
dreams. She would now have found it an intolerable 
bore to sit with hands idle in her lap and eyes upon 
vacancy, watching the dim, luminous shadows flit aimlessly 
by. Yet that was the way she used to pass hours   &mdash;   entire 
days. She used to fight off sleep at night the longer to 
enjoy her one source of pure happiness. There was 
no doubt about it, the fire of romance was burning low, 
and she was becoming commonplace, practical, resigned. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0432" n="405"/>  
Well, why not?  Was not life over for her?   &mdash;   that is, 
the life a girl's fancy longs for. In place of hope of 
romance, there was an uneasy feeling of a necessity of 
pleasing this husband of hers   &mdash;   of making him comfortable. 
What would befall her if she neglected trying 
to please him or if she, for all her trying, failed?  She 
did not look far in that direction. Her uneasiness 
remained indefinite   &mdash;   yet definite enough to keep her 
working from waking until bedtime. And she dropped 
into the habit of watching his face with the same 
anxiety with which a farmer watches the weather. When 
he happened one day to make a careless, absent-minded 
remark in disapproval of something in the domestic 
arrangements, she was thrown into such a nervous flutter 
that he observed it. 
</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing   &mdash;   nothing,&rdquo; replied she in the hurried 
tone of one who is trying hastily to cover his thoughts. 
</p><p>He reflected, understood, burst into a fit of hearty 
laughter. &ldquo;So, you are trying to make a bogey of 
me?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She colored, protested faintly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't you know I'm about the least tyrannical, 
least exacting person in the world?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You've been very patient with me,&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Now   &mdash;   now,&rdquo; cried he in a tone of raillery, &ldquo;you 
might as well drop that. Don't you know there's no 
reason for being afraid of me?&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0433" n="406"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> it,&rdquo; replied 
she. &ldquo;But I <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> afraid, 
just the same. I can't help it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>It was impossible for him to appreciate the effect 
of his personality upon others   &mdash;   how, without his trying 
or even wishing, it made them dread a purely imaginary 
displeasure and its absurdly imaginary consequences. 
But this confession of hers was not the first time he had 
heard of the effect of potential and latent danger he 
had upon those associated with him. And, as it was 
most useful, he was not sorry that he had it. He made 
no further attempt to convince her that he was harmless. 
He knew that he was harmless where she was concerned. 
Was it not just as well that she should not know 
it, when vaguely dreading him was producing excellent 
results?  As with a Christian the fear of the Lord 
was the beginning of wisdom, so with a wife the fear 
of her husband was the beginning of wisdom. In striving 
to please him, to fit herself for the position of wife, 
she was using up the time she would otherwise have 
spent in making herself miserable with self-pity   &mdash;   that 
supreme curse of the idle both male and female, that 
most prolific of the breeders of unhappy wives. Yes, 
wives were unhappy not because their husbands neglected 
them, for busy people have no time to note 
whether they are neglected or not, but because they 
gave their own worthless, negligent, incapable selves 
too much attention. 
</p><p>One evening, she, wearing the look of the timid but 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0434" n="407"/>  
resolute intruder, came into his room while he was 
dressing for dinner and hung about with an air no man 
of his experience could fail to understand. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Something wrong about the house?&rdquo; said he 
finally. &ldquo;Need more money?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No   &mdash;   nothing,&rdquo; she replied, with a slight flush. 
He saw that she was mustering all her courage for 
some grand effort. He waited, only mildly curious, as 
his mind was busy with some new business he and Tetlow 
had undertaken. Presently she stood squarely before 
him, her hands behind her back and her face upturned.  
&ldquo;Won't you kiss me?&rdquo; she said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said he. And he kissed her on the cheek 
and resumed operations with his military brushes. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I didn't mean that   &mdash;   that kind of a kiss,&rdquo; said she 
dejectedly. 
</p><p>He paused with a quick characteristic turn of the 
head, looked keenly at her, resumed his brushing. A 
quizzical smile played over his face. &ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said 
he. &ldquo;You've been thinking about duty. And you've 
decided to do yours. . . . Eh?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I think   &mdash;     It seems to me   &mdash;     I don't think   &mdash;   &rdquo; she 
stammered, then said desperately, &ldquo;I've not been acting 
right by you. I want to   &mdash;   to do better.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;That's good,&rdquo; said he briskly, with a nod of 
approval   &mdash;   and never a glance in her direction. &ldquo;You 
think you'll let me have a kiss now and then   &mdash;   eh?  All 
right, my dear.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0435" n="408"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you <hi rend="italic">won't</hi> understand 
me!&rdquo; she cried, ready 
to weep with vexation. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You mean I won't misunderstand you,&rdquo; replied 
he amiably, as he set about fixing his tie. &ldquo;You've 
been mulling things over in your mind. You've decided 
I'm secretly pining for you. You've resolved to be 
good and kind and dutiful   &mdash;   generous   &mdash;   to feed old dog 
Tray a few crumbs now and then. . . . That's nice and 
sweet of you   &mdash;   &rdquo;  He paused until the crisis in tying 
was passed   &mdash;   &ldquo;very nice and sweet of you   &mdash;   but   &mdash;    
There's nothing in it. All I ask of you for myself is 
to see that I'm comfortable   &mdash;   that Mrs. Lowell and the 
servants treat me right. If I don't like anything, I'll 
speak out   &mdash;   never fear.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But   &mdash;   Fred   &mdash;   I want to be your wife   &mdash;   I really 
do,&rdquo; she pleaded. 
</p><p>He turned on her, and his eyes seemed to pierce 
into the chamber of her thoughts. &ldquo;Drop it, my dear,&rdquo; 
he said quietly. &ldquo;Neither of us is in love with the 
other. So there's not the slightest reason for pretending. 
If I ever want to be free of you, I'll tell you so. 
If you ever want to get rid of me, all you have to do 
is to ask   &mdash;   and it'll be arranged. Meanwhile, let's enjoy 
ourselves.&rdquo; 
</p><p>His good humor, obviously unfeigned, would have 
completely discouraged a more experienced woman, 
though as vain as Dorothy and with as much ground 
as he had given her for self-confidence where he was 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0436" n="409"/>  
concerned. But Dorothy was depressed rather than 
profoundly discouraged. A few moments and she 
found courage to plead:  &ldquo;But you used to care for 
me. Don't I attract you any more?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You say that quite pathetically,&rdquo; said he, in good-humored amusement. &ldquo;I'm willing to do anything 
within reason for your happiness. But really   &mdash;   just 
to please your vanity I can't make myself over again 
into the fool I used to be about you. You'd hate it 
yourself. Why, then, this pathetic air?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I feel so useless   &mdash;   and as if I were shirking,&rdquo; she 
persisted. &ldquo;And if you did care for me, it wouldn't 
offend me now as it used to. I've grown much wiser   &mdash;    
more sensible. I understand things   &mdash;   and I look at 
them differently. And   &mdash;   I always did <hi rend="italic">like</hi> you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Even when you despised me?&rdquo; mocked he. It 
irritated him a little vividly to recall what a consummate 
fool he had made of himself for her, even though 
he had every reason to be content with the event of his 
folly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;A girl always thinks she despises a man when she 
can do as she pleases with him,&rdquo; replied she. &ldquo;As Mr. 
Tetlow said, I was a fool.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> was the fool,&rdquo; said he.  
&ldquo;Where did that man 
of mine lay the handkerchief?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I, too,&rdquo; cried she, eagerly. &ldquo;You were foolish to 
bother about a little silly like me. But, oh, what a <hi rend="italic">fool</hi> 
I was not to realize   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0437" n="410"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;You're not trying to tell me you're in love with 
me?&rdquo; said he sharply. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no   &mdash;   no, indeed,&rdquo; she protested in haste, 
alarmed by his overwhelming manner. &ldquo;I'm not trying 
to deceive you in any way.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Never do,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It's the one thing I can't 
stand.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But I thought   &mdash;   it seemed to me   &mdash;   &rdquo; she persisted, 
&ldquo;that perhaps if we tried to   &mdash;   to care for each other, 
we'd maybe get to   &mdash;   to caring   &mdash;   more or less. Don't 
you think so?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; was his careless reply. He added, 
&ldquo;But I, for one, am well content with things as they 
are. I confess I don't look back with any satisfaction 
on those months when I was making an ass of myself 
about you. I was ruining my career. Now I'm happy, 
and everything is going fine in my business. No 
experiments, if you please.&rdquo;  He shook his head, looking 
at her with smiling raillery. &ldquo;It might turn out that 
I'd care for you in the same crazy way again, and that 
you didn't like it. Again you might get excited about 
me and I'd remain calm about you. That would give 
me a handsome revenge, but I'm not looking for revenge.&rdquo; 
</p><p>He finished his toilet, she standing quiet and 
thoughtful in an attitude of unconscious grace. 
</p><p>&ldquo;No, my dear,&rdquo; resumed he, as he prepared to 
descend for dinner, &ldquo;let's have a peaceful, cheerful married 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0438" n="411"/>  
life, with no crazy excitements. Let's hang on to 
what we've got, and take no unnecessary risks.&rdquo;  He 
patted her on the shoulder. &ldquo;Isn't that sensible?&rdquo; 
</p><p>She looked at him with serious, appealing eyes. 
&ldquo;You are <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> you aren't unhappy?&rdquo; 
</p><p>It was amusing to him   &mdash;   though he concealed it   &mdash;    
to see how tenaciously her feminine egotism held to the 
idea that she was the important person. And, when 
women of experience thus deluded themselves, it was 
not at all strange that this girl should be unable to 
grasp the essential truth as to the relations of men and 
women   &mdash;   that, while a woman who makes her sex her 
profession must give to a man, to some man, a dominant 
place in her life, a man need give a woman   &mdash;   at 
least, any one woman   &mdash;   little or no place. But he 
would not wantonly wound her harmless vanity. &ldquo;Don't 
worry about me, please,&rdquo; said he in the kindest, 
friendliest way. &ldquo;I am telling you the truth.&rdquo; 
</p><p>And they descended to the dining room. Usually 
he was preoccupied and she did most of the talking   &mdash;    
not a difficult matter for her, as she was one of those 
who by nature have much to say, who talk on and on, 
giving lively, pleasant recitals of commonplace daily 
happenings. That evening it was her turn to be 
abstracted, or, at least, silent. He talked volubly, 
torrentially, like a man of teeming mind in the highest 
spirits. And he was in high spirits. The Galloway 
enterprise had developed into a huge success; also, it 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0439" n="412"/>  
did not lessen his sense of the pleasantness of life to 
have learned that his wife was feeling about as well 
disposed toward him as he cared to have her feel, had 
come round to that state of mind which he, as a practical 
man, wise in the art of life, regarded as ideal for 
a wife. 
</p><p>A successful man, with a quiet and comfortable 
home, well enough looked after by an agreeable wife, 
exceeding good to look at and interested only in her 
home and her husband   &mdash;   what more could a man ask? 
 
</p><p>What more could a man ask?  Only one thing more 
   &mdash;   a baby. The months soon passed and that rounding 
out of the home side of his life was consummated with 
no mishap. The baby was a girl, which contented him 
and delighted Dorothy. He wished it to be named after 
her, she preferred his sister's name   &mdash;   Ursula. It was 
Ursula who decided the question. &ldquo;She looks like you, 
Fred,&rdquo; she declared, after an earnest scanning of the 
wierd little face. &ldquo;Why not call her Frederica?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman thought this clumsy, but Dorothy instantly 
assented   &mdash;   and the baby was duly christened Frederica. 
</p><p>Perhaps it was because he was having less pressing 
business in town, but whatever the reason, he began to 
stay at home more   &mdash;   surprisingly more. And, being at 
home, he naturally fell into the habit of fussing with the 
baby, he having the temperament that compels a man to 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0440" n="413"/>  
be always at something, and the baby being convenient 
and in the nature of a curiosity. Ursula, who was 
stopping in the house, did not try to conceal her amazement 
at this extraordinary development of her brother's 
character. 
</p><p>Said she:  &ldquo;I never before knew you to take the 
slightest interest in a child.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Said he:  &ldquo;I never before saw a child worth taking 
the slightest interest in.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Ursula, &ldquo;it won't last. You'll 
soon grow tired of your plaything.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps you're right,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;I hope 
you're wrong.&rdquo;  He reflected, added:  &ldquo;In fact, I'm 
almost certain you're wrong. I'm too selfish to let myself 
lose such a pleasure. If you had observed my life 
closely, you'd have discovered that I have never given up 
a single thing I found a source of pleasure. That is 
good sense. That is why the superior sort of men and 
women retain something of the boy and the girl all their 
lives. I still like a lot of the games I played as a boy. 
For some years I've had no chance to indulge in them. 
I'll be glad when Rica is old enough to give me the chance 
again.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She was much amused. &ldquo;Who'd have suspected 
that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were a born father !&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Not I, for one,&rdquo; confessed he. &ldquo;We never know 
what there is in us until circumstances bring it out.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;A devoted father and a doting husband,&rdquo; pursued 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0441" n="414"/>  
Ursula. &ldquo;I must say I rather sympathize with you as 
a doting husband. Of course, I, a woman, can't see her 
as you do. I can't imagine a man   &mdash;   especially a man 
of your sort   &mdash;   going stark mad about a mere woman. 
But, as women go, I'll admit she is a good specimen. 
Not the marvel of intelligence and complex character 
you imagine, but still a good specimen. And physically   &mdash;   &rdquo; 
She laughed   &mdash;     &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">That's</hi> what caught 
you. 
That's what holds you   &mdash;   and will hold you as long as it 
lasts.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Was there ever a woman who didn't think that?   &mdash;    
and didn't like to think it, though I believe many of them 
make strong pretense at scorning the physical.&rdquo;  Fred 
was regarding his sister with a quizzical expression. 
&ldquo;You approve of her?&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>&ldquo;More than I'd have thought possible. And after 
I've taken her about in the world a while she'll be perfect.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;But, alas, she'll never 
be perfect. For, you're not going to take her about.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;So she says when I talk of it to her,&rdquo; replied 
Ursula. &ldquo;But I know you'll insist. You needn't be uneasy 
as to how she'll be received.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm not,&rdquo; said Norman dryly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You've got back all you lost   &mdash;   and more. How 
we Americans do worship success!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Don't suggest to Dorothy anything further about 
society,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;I've no time or taste for it, 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0442" n="415"/>  
and I don't wish to be annoyed by intrusions into my 
home.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But you'll not be satisfied always with just her,&rdquo; 
urged his sister. &ldquo;Besides, you've got a position to 
maintain.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman's smile was cynically patient. &ldquo;I want my 
home and I want my career,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And I don't 
want any society nonsense. I had the good luck to 
marry a woman who knows and cares nothing about it. 
I don't purpose to give up the greatest advantage of 
my marriage.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Ursula was astounded. She knew the meaning of 
his various tones and manners, and his way of rejecting 
her plans for Dorothy   &mdash;   and, incidentally, for her own 
amusement   &mdash;   convinced her that he was through and 
through in earnest. &ldquo;It will be dreadfully lonesome 
for her, Fred,&rdquo; she pleaded. 
</p><p>&ldquo;We'll wait till that trouble faces us,&rdquo; replied he, 
not a bit impressed. &ldquo;And don't forget   &mdash;   not a word 
of temptation to her from you.&rdquo;  This with an expression 
that warned her how well he knew her indirect ways 
of accomplishing what she could not gain directly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I shan't interfere,&rdquo; said she in a tone that 
made it a binding promise. &ldquo;But you can't expect me 
to sympathize with your plans for an old-fashioned 
domestic life.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;You don't 
understand. Women of your sort never do. That's why 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0443" n="416"/>  
you're not fit to be the wives of men worth while. A 
serious man and a society woman can't possibly hit it 
off together. For a serious man the outside world is a 
place to work, and home is a place to rest. For a society 
woman, the world is a place to idle and home is a work 
shop, an entertainment factory. It's impossible to 
reconcile those two opposite ideas.&rdquo; 
</p><p>She saw his point at once, and it appealed to her 
intelligence. And she had his own faculty for never 
permitting prejudice to influence judgment. She said in a 
dubious tone, &ldquo;Do you think Dorothy will sympathize 
with your scheme?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I'm sure I don't know,&rdquo; replied he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;If she doesn't   &mdash;   &rdquo; Ursula halted there. 
</p><p>Her brother shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;If she proves 
to be the wrong sort of woman for me, she'll go her way 
and I mine.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why, I thought you loved her!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;What have I said that leads you to change your 
mind?&rdquo; said he. 
</p><p>&ldquo;A man does not take the high hand with the woman 
he adores.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; said Norman tranquilly. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said his puzzled sister by way of conclusion, 
&ldquo;if you persist in being the autocrat   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Autocrat?   &mdash;   I?&rdquo; laughed he. &ldquo;Am I trying to 
compel her to do anything she doesn't wish to do? 
Didn't I say she would be free to go if she were dissatisfied 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0444" n="417"/>  
with me and my plan   &mdash;   if she didn't adopt it gladly 
as her own plan, also?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;But you know very well she's dependent upon you, 
Fred.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Is that my fault?  Does a man force a woman to 
become dependent?  And just because she is dependent, 
should he therefore yield to her and let her make of his 
life a waste and a folly?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You're far too clever for me to argue with. 
Anyhow, as I was saying, if you persist in what I call 
tyranny   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;When a woman cries tyranny, it means she's furious 
because she is not getting <hi rend="italic">her</hi> 
autocratic way.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; admitted Ursula cheerfully. &ldquo;At 
any rate, if you persist   &mdash;   unless she loves you utterly, 
your life will be miserable.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She may make her own life miserable, but not 
mine,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;If I were the ordinary man   &mdash;    
counting himself lucky to have induced any woman to 
marry him   &mdash;   afraid if he lost his woman he'd not be able 
to get another   &mdash;   able to give his woman only an indifferent 
poor support, and so on   &mdash;   if I were one of those 
men, what you say might be true. But what deep and 
permanent mischief can a frail woman do a strong 
man?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;There's instance after instance in history&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Of strong men wrecking <hi rend="italic">themselves</hi> through various 
kinds of madness, including sex madness. But, my 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0445" n="418"/>  
dear Ursula, not an instance   &mdash;   not one   &mdash;   where the 
woman was responsible. If history were truth, instead 
of lies   &mdash;   you women might have less conceit.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;You   &mdash;   talking this way!&rdquo; mocked Ursula. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Meaning, I suppose, my late infatuation?&rdquo; 
inquired he, unruffled. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I never saw or read of a worse case.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Am I ruined?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No. But why not?  Because you got her. If 
you hadn't   &mdash;   &rdquo;  Ursula blew out a large cloud of 
cigarette smoke with a &ldquo;Pouf!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;If I hadn't got her,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;I'd have got 
well, just the same, in due time. A sick <hi rend="italic">weak</hi> man goes 
down; a sick <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> man gets well.  
When a man who's 
reputed to be strong doesn't get well, it's because he 
merely seemed strong but wasn't. The poets and novelists 
and the historians and the rest of the nature fakers 
fail to tell <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the facts, dear 
sister. All the facts would 
spoil a pretty story.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Ursula thought a few minutes, suddenly burst out 
with, &ldquo;Do you think Dorothy loves you now?&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman rose to go out doors. &ldquo;I don't think about 
such unprofitable things,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;As long as we suit 
each other and get along pleasantly   &mdash;   why bother about 
a name for it?&rdquo; 
</p><p>In the French window he paused, stood looking out 
with an expression so peculiar that Ursula, curious, 
came to see the cause. A few yards away, under a big 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0446" n="419"/>  
symmetrical maple in full leaf sat Dorothy with the 
baby on her lap. She was dressed very simply in white. 
There was a little sunlight upon her hair, a sheen of gold 
over her skin. She was looking down at the baby. Her 
expression   &mdash;    
</p><p>Said Ursula:  &ldquo;Several of the great painters have 
tried to catch that expression. But they've failed.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Norman made no reply. He had not heard. All 
in an instant there had been revealed to him a whole 
new world   &mdash;   a view of man and woman   &mdash;   of woman   &mdash;    
of sex   &mdash;   its meaning so different from what he had 
believed and lived. 
</p><p>&ldquo;What're you thinking about, Fred?&rdquo; inquired his 
sister. 
</p><p>He shook his head, with a mysterious smile, and 
strolled away.</p>

<p>THE baby grew and thrived, as the habit is with 
healthy children well taken care of. Mrs. Norman soon 
got back her strength, her figure, and perhaps more 
than her former beauty   &mdash;   as the habit is with healthy 
women well taken care of. Norman's career continued 
to prosper, likewise according to the habit of all healthy 
things well taken care of. In a world where nothing 
happens by chance, mischance, to be serious, must have 
some grave fault as its hidden cause. We mortals, who 
love to live at haphazard and to blame God or destiny 
or &ldquo;bad luck&rdquo; for our calamities, hate to take this 
modern and scientific view of the world and life. But, 
whether we like it or not, it is the truth   &mdash;   and, as we 
can't get round it, why not accept it cheerfully and, so 
appear a little less ignorant and ridiculous? 
</p><p>During their first year at the Hempstead place the 
results in luxury and comfort had at no time accounted 
for the money it cost and the servants it employed   &mdash;    
that is to say, paid. But Norman was neither unreasonable 
nor impatient. Also, in his years of experience 
with his sister's housekeeping, and of observation of 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0448" n="421"/>  
the other women, he had grown exceedingly moderate 
in his estimate of the ability of women and in his 
expectations from them. He had reached the conclusion 
that the women who were sheltered and pampered by 
the men of the successful classes were proficient only 
in those things that call for no skill or effort beyond 
the wagging of the tongue. He saw that Dorothy was 
making honest endeavor to learn her business, and he 
knew that learning takes time   &mdash;   much time. 
</p><p>He believed that in the end she would do better than 
any other wife of his acquaintance, at the business of 
wife and mother. 
</p><p>Before the baby was two years old, his belief was 
rewarded. Things began to run better   &mdash;   began to run 
well, even. Dorothy   &mdash;   a serious person, unhampered of 
a keen sense of humor, had taught herself the duties 
of her new position in much the same slow plodding way 
in which she had formerly made of herself a fair stenographer 
and a tolerable typewriter. Mrs. Lowell had 
helped   &mdash;   and Ursula, too   &mdash;   and Norman not a little. 
But Dorothy, her husband discovered, was one of those 
who thoroughly assimilate what they take in   &mdash;   who make 
it over into part of themselves. So, her manner of keeping 
house, of arranging the gardens, of bringing up the 
baby, of dressing herself, was peculiarly her own. It 
was not by any means the best imaginable way. It was 
even what many energetic, systematic and highly competent 
persons would speak contemptuously of. But it 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0449" n="422"/>  
satisfied Norman   &mdash;   and that was all Dorothy had in 
mind. 
</p><p>If those who have had any considerable opportunity 
to observe married life will forget what they have read 
in novels and will fix their minds on what they have 
observed at first hand, they will recognize the Norman 
marriage, with the husband and wife living together 
yet apart as not peculiar but of a rather common type. 
Neither Fred nor Dorothy had any especial reason on 
any given day to try to alter their relations; so the 
law of inertia asserted itself and matters continued as 
they had begun. It was, perhaps, a chance remark of 
Tetlow's that was the remote but efficient cause of a 
change, as the single small stone slipping high up on 
the mountain side results in a vast landslide into the 
valley miles below. Tetlow said one day, in connection 
with some estate they were settling: 
</p><p>&ldquo;I've always pitied the only child. It must be 
miserably lonesome.&rdquo; 
</p><p>No sooner were the words out of his mouth than 
he colored violently; for, he remembered that the 
Normans had but one child and he knew the probable reason 
for it. Norman seemed not to have heard or seen. 
Tetlow hoped he hadn't, but, knowing the man, feared 
otherwise. And he was right. 
</p><p>In the press of other matters Norman forgot 
Tetlow's remark   &mdash;   remembered it again a few days later 
when he was taking the baby out for an airing in the 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0450" n="423"/>  
motor   &mdash;   forgot it again   &mdash;   finally, when he took a several 
days' rest at home, remembered it and kept it in mind. 
He began to think of Dorothy once more in a definite, 
personal way, began to observe her as his wife, instead 
of as mere part of his establishment. An intellectual 
person she certainly was not. She had a quaint 
individual way of speaking and of acting. She had the 
marvelous changeable beauty that had once caused him 
to take the bit in his teeth and run wild. But he would 
no more think of talking with her about the affairs that 
really interested him than   &mdash;   well, than the other men of 
large career in his acquaintance would think of talking 
those matters to their wives. 
</p><p>But   &mdash;     He was astonished to discover that he liked 
this slim, quiet, unobtrusive little wife of his better than 
he liked anyone else in the world, that he eagerly turned 
away from the clever and amusing companionship he 
might have at his clubs to come down to the country 
and be with her and the baby   &mdash;   not the baby alone, but 
her also. Why?  He could not find a satisfactory reason. 
He saw that she created at that Hempstead place 
an atmosphere of rest, of tranquility. But this merely 
thrust the mystery one step back. <hi rend="italic">How</hi> 
did she create 
this atmosphere   &mdash;   and for a man of his varied and 
discriminating tastes?  To that question he could work 
out no answer. She had for him now a charm as different 
from the infatuation of former days as calm sea is 
from tempest-racked sea   &mdash;   utterly different, yet fully 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0451" n="424"/>  
as potent. As he observed her and wondered at these 
discoveries of his, the ghost of a delight he had thought 
forever dead stirred in his heart, in his fancy. Yes, 
it was a pleasure, a thrilling pleasure to watch her. 
There was music in those quiet, graceful movements of 
hers, in that quiet, sweet voice. Not the wild, blood-heating music of the former days, but a kind far more 
melodious   &mdash;   tender, restful to nerves sorely tried by the 
tensions of ambition. He made some sort of an attempt 
to define his feeling for her, but could not. It seemed 
to fit into none of the usual classifications. 
</p><p>Then, he wondered   &mdash;     &ldquo;What is <hi rend="italic">she</hi> thinking 
of <hi rend="italic">me</hi>?&rdquo; 
</p><p>To find out he resorted to various elaborate round 
about methods that did credit to the ingenuity of his 
mind. But he made at every cunning cast a barren 
water-haul. Either she was not thinking of him at all 
or what she thought swam too deep for any casts he 
knew how to make in those hidden and unfamiliar 
waters. Or, perhaps she did not herself know what 
she thought, being too busy with the baby and the 
household to have time for such abstract and not pressing, 
perhaps not important, matters. He moved slowly 
in his inquiries into her state of mind because there 
was all the time in the world and no occasion for haste. 
He moved cautiously because he wished to do nothing 
that might disturb the present serenity of their home 
life. Did she dislike him?  Was she indifferent?  Had 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0452" n="425"/>  
she developed a habit of having him about that was in 
a way equivalent to liking? 
</p><p>These languid but delightful investigations   &mdash;   not 
unlike the pastimes one spins out when one has a long, 
long lovely summer day with hours on hours for luxurious 
happy idling   &mdash;   these investigations were abruptly 
suspended by a suddenly compelled trip to Europe. 
He arranged for Dorothy to send him a cable every 
day   &mdash;   &ldquo;about yourself and the baby&rdquo;   &mdash;   and he sent an 
occasional cabled bulletin about himself in reply. But 
neither wrote to the other; their relationship was not 
of the letter-exchanging kind   &mdash;   and had no need of pretense 
at what it was not. 
</p><p>In the third month of his absence, his sister Ursula 
came over for dresses, millinery and truly aristocratic 
society. She had little time for him, or he for her, but 
they happened to lunch alone about a week after his 
arrival. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You're looking cross and unhappy,&rdquo; said she. 
&ldquo;What's the matter?  Business?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No   &mdash;   everything's going well.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Same thing that's troubling Dorothy, then?&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Is Dorothy ill?&rdquo; inquired he, suddenly as alert as 
he had been absent. &ldquo;She hasn't let me know anything 
about it.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Ill?  Of course not,&rdquo; reassured Ursula. &ldquo;She's 
never ill. But   &mdash;   I've not anywhere or ever seen two 
people as crazy about each other as you and she.&rdquo; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0453" n="426"/>  
</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Norman had relapsed into interest in 
what he was eating. 
</p><p>&ldquo;You live all alone down there in the country. 
You treat anyone who comes to see you as intruder. 
And as soon as darling husband goes away, darling 
wife wanders about like a damned soul. Honestly, it 
gave me the blues to look at her eyes. And I used to 
think she cared more about the baby than about you.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;She's probably worried about something else,&rdquo; 
said Norman. &ldquo;More salad?  No?  There's no dessert   &mdash;    
at least I've ordered none. But if you'd like some 
strawberries   &mdash;      &mdash;   &rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I thought of that,&rdquo; replied Ursula, not to be 
deflected. &ldquo;I mean of her being upset about something 
beside you. I'm slow to suspect anyone of really caring 
about any <hi rend="italic">one</hi> else. But, although she 
didn't confess, 
I soon saw that it was your absence. And she 
wasn't putting on for my benefit, either. My maid hears 
the same thing from all the servants.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;This is pleasant,&rdquo; said Norman in his mocking 
good-humored way. 
</p><p>&ldquo;And you're in the same state,&rdquo; she charged with 
laughing but sympathetic eyes. &ldquo;Why, Fred, you're 
as madly in love with her as ever.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said he reflectively. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn't you bring her with you?&rdquo; 
</p><p>He stared at his sister like a man who has just 
discovered that he, with incredible stupidity, had over-
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0454" n="427"/>  
looked the obvious. &ldquo;I didn't think I'd be away long,&rdquo; 
evaded he. 
</p><p>He saw Ursula off for the Continent, half promised 
to join her in a few weeks at Aix. A day or so after 
her departure he had a violent fit of blues, was haunted 
by a vision of the baby and the comfortable, peaceful 
house on Long Island. He had expected to stay about 
two months longer. &ldquo;I'm sick of England and of 
hotels,&rdquo; he said, and closed up his business and sailed the 
following week. 
 
</p><p>She and the baby were at the pier to meet him. He 
looked for signs of the mourning Ursula had described, 
but he looked in vain. Never had he seen her lovelier, 
or so sparkling. And how she did talk!   &mdash;   rattling on 
and on, with those interesting commonplaces of domestic 
event   &mdash;   the baby, the household, the garden, the baby 
   &mdash;   the horses, the dogs, the baby   &mdash;   the servants, her new 
dresses, the baby   &mdash;   and so on, and so on   &mdash;   and the 
baby. 
</p><p>But when they got into the motor at Hempstead 
station for the drive home, silence fell upon her   &mdash;   he 
had been almost silent from the start of the little 
journey. As the motor swung into the grounds, looking 
their most beautiful for his homecoming, an enormous 
wave of pure delight began to surge up in him, to swell, 
to rush, to break, dashing its spray of tears into his 
eyes. He turned his head away to hide the too obvious 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002243_0455" n="428"/>  
display of feeling. They went into the house, he carrying 
the baby. He gave it to the nurse   &mdash;   and he and 
she were alone. 
</p><p>&ldquo;It certainly is good to be home again,&rdquo; he said. 
</p><p>The words were the tamest commonplace. We always 
speak in the old stereotyped commonplaces when 
we speak directly from the heart. His tone made her 
glance quickly at him. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Why, I believe you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> 
glad,&rdquo; said she. 
</p><p>He took her hand. They looked at each other. 
Suddenly she flung herself wildly into his arms and 
clung to him in an agony of joy and fear. &ldquo;Oh, I 
missed you so!&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;I missed you so!&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It was frightful,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It shall never 
happen again.&rdquo;</p>
