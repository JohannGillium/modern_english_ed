				<head>To the Right Honourable, William, Earle of Devonshire, My most honoured Lord<lb/>
					<hi rend="italic">May it please your Lordship,</hi></head>

				<p> It was the speech of the Roman people (to whom the name of King had been render'd odious, as well by the tyrannie of the <hi rend="italic">Tarquins</hi>, as by the<hi
						rend="italic"> Genius</hi> and Decretals of that City) 'Twas the speech I say of the publick, however pronounced from a private mouth, (if yet<hi rend="italic">
					Cato</hi> the Censor were no more then <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0017"/> such) <hi rend="italic">That all Kings are to be reckon'd amongst ravenous Beasts</hi>. But what
					a Beast of prey was the Roman people, whilst with its conquering Eagles it erected its proud Trophees so far and wide over the world, bringing the Africans, the
					Asiaticks, the Macedonians, and the Achaeans, with many other despoyled Nations, into a specious bondage, with the pretence of preferring them to be Denizons of <hi
						rend="italic">Rome</hi>? So that if <hi rend="italic">Cato's</hi> saying were a wise one, 'twas every whit as wise that of <hi rend="italic">Pontius Telesinus</hi>; who
					flying about with open mouth through all the Companies of his Army, (in that famous encounter which he had with Sylla) cryed out, That<hi rend="italic"> Rome her selfe,
						as well as Sylla, was to be raz'd</hi>; for that there would alwayes be Wolves and Depraedatours of their <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0018"/> Liberty, unlesse the
					Forrest that lodg'd them were grubb'd up by the roots. To speak impartially, both sayings are very true; <hi rend="italic">That Man to Man is a kind of God; and that Man
						to Man is an arrant Wolfe:</hi> The first is true, if we compare Citizens amongst themselves; and the second, if we compare Cities. In the one, there's some analogie of
					similitude with the Deity, to wit, Justice and Charity, the twin-sisters of peace: But in the other, Good men must defend themselves by taking to them for a Sanctuary the
					two daughters of War, Deceipt and Violence: that is in plaine termes a meer brutall Rapacity: which although men object to one another as a reproach, by an inbred custome
					which they have of beholding their own actions in the persons of other men, wherein, as in a Mirroir, all <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0019"/> things on the left side
					appeare to be on the right, &amp; all things on the right side to be as plainly on the left; yet the naturall right of preservation which we all receive from the
					uncontroulable Dictates of Necessity, will not admit it to be a Vice, though it confesse it to be an Unhappinesse. Now that with <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> himselfe, (a
					person of so great a renowne for wisdome) Animosity should so prevaile instead of Judgement, and partiality instead of Reason, that the very same thing which he thought
					equall in his popular State, he should censure as unjust in a Monarchical, other men perhaps may have leisure to admire. But I have been long since of this opinion, That
					there was never yet any more-then-vulgar-prudence that had the luck of being acceptable to the Giddy <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0020"/> people; but either it hath not
					been understood, or else having been so, hath been levell'd and cryed downe. The more eminent Actions and Apothegms both of the Greeks and Romans have been indebted for
					their Eulogies not so much to the <hi rend="italic">Reason</hi>, as to the <hi rend="italic">Greatnesse</hi> of them, and very many times to that prosperous usurpation
					(with which our Histories doe so mutually upbraid each other) which as a conquering Torrent carryes all before it, as well publick Agents as publick Actions, in the
					streame of Time. Wisdome properly so call'd is nothing else but this, <hi rend="italic">The perfect knowledge of the Truth in all matters whatsoever</hi>. Which being
					derived from the Registers and Records of <hi rend="italic">Things</hi>, and that as 'twere through the Conduit of certain definite Appellations, cannot <pb
						entity="DSSR_000002537_0021"/> possibly be the work of a suddaine Acutenesse, but of a well-ballanc'd Reason, which by the <hi rend="italic">Compendium</hi> of a word,
					we call <hi rend="italic">Philosophy</hi>. For by this it is, that a way is open'd to us, in which we travell from the contemplation of particular things to the Inference
					or result of universall Actions. Now look how many sorts of things there are which properly fall within the cognizance of humane reason, into so many branches does the
					tree of philosophy divide it selfe. And from the diversity of the matter about which they are conversant, there hath been given to those branches a diversity of Names
					too: For treating of Figures, tis call'd <hi rend="italic">Geometry</hi>. of motion, <hi rend="italic">Physick</hi>; of naturall right, <hi rend="italic">Moralls</hi>;
					put all together, and they make up <hi rend="italic">Philosophy</hi>. Just as the British, the Atlantick, and the Indian <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0022"/> Seas, being
					diversly christen'd from the diversity of their shoares, doe notwithstanding all together make up <hi rend="italic">The Ocean</hi>. And truly the Geometricians have very
					admirably perform'd their part. For whatsoever assistance doth accrew to the life of man, whether from the observation of the Heavens, or from the description of the
					Earth, from the notation of Times, or from the remotest Experiments of Navigation; Finally, whatsoever things they are in which this present Age doth differ from the rude
					simplenesse of Antiquity, we must acknowledge to be a debt which we owe meerly to Geometry. If the Morall philosophers had as happily discharg'd their duty, I know not
					what could have been added by humane Industry to the completion of that happinesse, which is <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0023"/> consistent with humane life. For were the
					nature of humane Actions as distinctly knowne, as the nature of <hi rend="italic">Quantity</hi> in Geometricall Figures, the strength of <hi rend="italic">Avarice</hi>
					and <hi rend="italic">Ambition</hi>, which is sustained by the erroneous opinions of the Vulgar, as touching the nature of <hi rend="italic">Right</hi> and <hi
						rend="italic">Wrong</hi>, would presently faint and languish; And Mankinde should enjoy such an Immortall peace, that (unlesse it were for habitation, on supposition
					that the Earth should grow too narrow for her Inhabitants) there would hardly be left any pretence for war. But now on the contrary, that neither the Sword nor the pen
					should be allowed any <hi rend="italic">Cessation</hi>; That the knowledge of the Law of Nature should lose its growth, not advancing a whit beyond its antient stature;
					that there should still be such siding with the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0024"/> severall factions of philosophers, that the very same Action should bee decryed by
					some, and as much elevated by others; that the very same man should at severall times embrace his severall opinions, and esteem his own Actions farre otherwise in
					himselfe then he does in others; These I say are so many signes, so many manifest Arguments, that what hath hitherto been written by Morall philosophers, hath not made
					any progress in the knowledge of the Truth; but yet have took with the world, not so much by giving any light to the understanding, as entertainment to the Affections,
					whilest by the successefull Rhetorications of their speech they have confirmed them in their rashly received opinions. So that this part of philosophy hath suffered the
						same<hi rend="italic"> destiny</hi> with the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0025"/>
					<hi rend="italic">publick Wayes</hi>, which lye open to all passengers to traverse up and down or <hi rend="italic">the same lot with high wayes and open streets</hi>;
					Some for divertisement, and some for businesse; so that what with the Impertinencies of some, and the Altercations of others, those wayes have never a seeds time, and
					therefore yield never a harvest. The onely reason of which unluckines should seem to be this; That amongst all the writers of that part of philosophy, there is not one
					that hath used an idoneous principle of Tractation: For we may not, as in a Circle, begin the handling of a Science from what point we please. There is a certain Clue of
					Reason, whose beginning is in the dark, but by the benefit of whose Conduct, wee are led as 'twere by the hand into the clearest light, so that the principle <pb
						entity="DSSR_000002537_0026"/> of Tractation is to be taken from that Darknesse, and then the light to be carried thither for the irradiating its doubts. As often
					therefore as any writer, doth either weakly forsake that Clue, or wilfully cut it asunder, he describes the Footsteps, not of his progresse in <hi rend="italic"
					>Science</hi>, but of his wandrings from it. And upon this it was, that when I applyed my Thoughts to the Investigation of Naturall Justice, I was presently advertised
					from the very word <hi rend="italic">Justice</hi>, (wich signifies a steady Will of giving every one his <hi rend="italic">Owne</hi>) that my first enquiry was to be,
					from whence it proceeded, that any man should call any thing rather his <hi rend="italic">Owne</hi>, then <hi rend="italic">another mans</hi>. And when I found that this
					proceeded not from Nature, but Consent, (for what Nature at first laid forth in common, men did afterwards <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0027"/> distribute into severall <hi
						rend="italic">Impropriations</hi>, I was conducted from thence to another Inquiry, namely to what end, and upon what Impulsives, when all was equally every mans in
					common, men did rather think it fitting, that every man should have his Inclosure; And I found the reason was, that from a Community of Goods, there must needs arise
					Contention whose enjoyment should be greatest, and from that Contention all kind of Calamities must unavoydably ensue, which by the instinct of Nature, every man is
					taught to shun. Having therefore thus arrived at two maximes of humane Nature, the one arising from the <hi rend="italic">concupiscible</hi> part, which desires to
					appropriate to it selfe the use of those things in which all others have a joynt interest, the other proceeding <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0028"/> from the<hi
						rend="italic"> rationall</hi>, which teaches every man to fly a contre-naturall Dissolution, as the greatest mischiefe that can arrive to Nature; Which principles being
					laid down, I seem from them to have demonstrated by a most evident connexion, in this little work of mine, first the absolute necessity of Leagues and Contracts, and
					thence the rudiments both of morall and of civill prudence. That Appendage which is added concerning the Regiment of God, hath been done with this intent, that the
					Dictates of God Almighty in the Law of nature, might not seem repugnant to the written Law, revealed to us in his word. I have also been very wary in the whole tenour of
					my discourse, not to meddle with the civill Lawes of any particular nation whatsoever, That is to say, I <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0029"/> have avoyded coming a shore,
					which those Times have so infested both with shelves, and Tempests. At what expence of time and industry I have beene in this scrutiny after Truth, I am not ignorant; but
					to what purpose, I know not. For being partiall Judges of our selves, we lay a partiall estimate upon our own productions. I therefore offer up this Book to your
					Lordships, not favour, but censure first, as having found by many experiments, that it is not the credit of the Author, nor the newnesse of the work, nor yet the ornament
					of the style, but only the weight of Reason, which recommends any <hi rend="italic">Opinion</hi> to your Lordships Favour and Approbation. If it fortune to please, that
					is to say, if it be sound, if it be usefull, if it be not vulgar; I humbly offer it to your Lordship <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0030"/> as both my Glory, and my
					protection; But if in any thing I have erred, your Lordship will yet accept it as a Testimony of my Gratitude, for that the means of study which I enjoyed by your
					Lordships Goodnesse, I have employed to the procurement of your Lordships Favour. The God of Heaven crown your Lordship with length of Dayes in this earthly Station, and

				<head>The Authors<lb/> Preface<lb/>to the<lb/> Reader</head>

				<p>
					<hi rend="italic">Reader, I promise thee here such things, which ordinarily promised, doe seeme to challenge the greatest attention, and I lay them here before thine
						eyes, whether thou regard the dignity or profit of the matter treated of, or the right method of handling it, or the honest motive, and good advice to undertake it, or
						lastly the moderation of the Authour. In this Book thou shalt finde briefly described the duties of men, First as Men, then as Subjects, <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0033"/> Lastly, as Christians; under which duties are contained not only the elements of the Lawes of Nature, and of Nations, together with the
						true originall, and power of Justice, but also the very essence of Christian Religion it selfe, so farre forth as the measure of this my purpose could well bear
					it.</hi>
				</p>
				<p><hi rend="italic">Which kinde of doctrine (excepting what relates to Christian Religion) the most antient </hi>Sages <hi rend="italic">did judge fittest to be delivered
						to posterity, either curiously adorned with Verse, or clouded with Allegories, as a most beautifull and hallowed mystery of Royall authority; lest by the disputations
						of private men, it might be defiled; Other philosophers in the mean time, to the advantage of mankinde, did contemplate the faces, and motions of things; others,
						without disadvantage, their natures, and causes. But in after times,</hi>Socrates <hi rend="italic">is said to have been the first, who truly loved this civill Science,
						although hitherto not throughly understood, yet glimmering forth as through a cloud in the government of the Common weale, and that he set so great a value on this,
						that utterly abandoning, and despising all other parts of philosophy, he wholly embraced <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0034"/> this, as judging it onely worthy the labour
						of his minde. After him comes</hi> Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, <hi rend="italic">and other philosophers, as well Greeke, as Latine. And now at length all men of all
						Nations, not only philosophers, but even the vulgar, have, and doe still deale with this as a matter of ease, exposed and prostitute to every Mother-wit, and to be
						attained without any great care or study. And which makes mainly for its dignity, those who suppose themselves to have it, or are in such employment, as they ought to
						have it, doe so wonderfully please themselves in its</hi> Idaea, <hi rend="italic">as they easily brooke the followers of other arts to be esteemed and styled
						ingenuous, learned, skilfull, what you will; except prudent: for this Name, in regard of civill knowledge, they presume to be due to themselves onely. Whether therefore
						the worth of arts is to be weighed by the worthinesse of the persons who entertain them, or by the number of those who have written of them, or by the judgement of the
						wisest. certainly this must carry it, which so neerly relates to</hi> Princes,<hi rend="italic"> and others engaged in the government of mankinde, in whose adulterate
						Species <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0035"/> also the most part of men doe delight themselves, and in which the most excellent wits of</hi> Philosophers <hi rend="italic"
						>have been conversant. The benefit of it when rightly delivered (that is) when derived from true principles by evident connexion, we shall then best discerne, when we
						shall but well have considered the mischiefes that have befallen mankinde in its counterfeit and babling form; for in such matters as are speculated for the exercise of
						our wits, if any errour escape us, it is without hurt; neither is there any losse, but of time onely: but in those things which every man ought to meditate for the
						steerage of his life, it necessarily happens, that not onely from errours, but even from ignorance it selfe, there arise offences, contentions, nay even slaughter it
						selfe. Look now, how great a prejudice these are, such, and so great is the benefit arising from this doctrine of morality, truly declared. How many Kings (and those
						good men too) hath this one errour, That a Tyrant King might lawfully be put to death, been the slaughter of? How many throats hath this false position cut, That a</hi>
						Prince<hi rend="italic"> for some causes may by some certain men be deposed? And <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0036"/> what blood-shed hath not this erroneous doctrine
						caused, That Kings are not superiours to, but administrators for the multitude? Lastly, how many rebellions hath this opinion been the cause of which teacheth that the
						knowledge whether the commands of Kings be just or unjust, belongs to private men, and that before they yeeld obedience, they not only may, but ought to dispute them?
						Besides, in the morall philosophy now commonly received, there are many things no lesse dangerous then those, which it matters not now to recite. I suppose those
						antients foresaw this, who rather chose to have the Science of justice wrapt up in fables, then openly exposed to disputations: for before such questions began to be
						moved, princes did not sue for, but already exercised the supreme power. They kept their Empire entire, not by arguments, but by punishing the wicked, and protecting
						the good; likewise Subjects did not measure what was just by the sayings and judgements of private men, but by the Lawes of the Realme; nor were they kept in peace by
						disputations, but by power and authority: yea they reverenced the supreme power, whether <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0037"/> residing in one man or in a councell, as a
						certain visible divinity; therefore they little used as in our dayes, to joyn themselves with ambitious, and hellish spirits, to the utter ruine of their State; for
						they could not entertain so strange a phansie as not to desire the preservation of that by which they were preserved; in truth, the simplicity of those times was not
						yet capable of so learned a piece of folly. Wherefore it was peace, and a golden age, which ended not before that</hi>Saturn <hi rend="italic">being expelled, it was
						taught lawfull to take up arms against Kings. This I say, the Antients not only themselves saw, but in one of their fables, they seem very aptly to have signified it to
						us; for they say, that when</hi> Ixion <hi rend="italic">was invited by</hi> Jupiter <hi rend="italic">to a banquet, he fell in love, and began to court </hi>Juno <hi
						rend="italic">her selfe; offering to embrace her, he clasp't a clowd, from whence the</hi> Centaures <hi rend="italic">proceeded, by nature halfe men, halfe horses, a
						fierce, a fighting, and unquiet generation; which changing the names only, is as much as if they should have said, that private men being called to Counsels of State
						desired to prostitute justice, the onely sister and wife of the supreme, to <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0038"/> their own judgements, and apprehensions, but embracing a
						false and empty shadow instead of it, they have begotten those hermaphrodite opinions of morall philosophers, partly right and comely, partly brutall and wilde, the
						causes of all contentions, and blood-sheds. Since therefore such opinions are daily seen to arise, if any man now shall dispell those clowds, and by most firm reasons
						demonstrate that there are no authenticall doctrines concerning right and wrong, good and evill, besides the constituted Lawes in each Realme, and government; and that
						the question whether any future action will prove just or unjust, good or ill, is to be demanded of none, but those to whom the supreme hath committed the
						interpretation of his Lawes; surely he will not only shew us the high way to peace, but will also teach us how to avoyd the close, darke, and dangerous by-paths of
						faction and sedition, then which I know not what can be thought more profitable.</hi>
				</p>
				<p><hi rend="italic"> Concerning my Method, I thought it not sufficient to use a plain and evident style in what I had to deliver, except I took my begining from the very
						matter of civill government, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0039"/> thence proceeded to its generation, and form, and the first beginning of justice; for every thing is
						best understood by its constitutive causes; for as in a watch, or some such small engine, the matter, figure, and motion of the wheeles, cannot well be known, except it
						be taken in sunder, and viewed in parts; so to make a more curious search into the rights of States, and duties of Subjects, it is necessary, (I say not to take them in
						sunder, but yet that) they be so considered, as if they were dissolved, (i.e.) that wee rightly understand what the quality of humane nature is, in what matters it is,
						in what not fit to make up a civill government, and how men must be agreed among themselves, that intend to grow up into a well-grounded State. Having therefore
						followed this kind of Method; In the first place I set down for a principle by experience known to all men, and denied by none, to wit, that the dispositions of men are
						naturally such, that except they be restrained through feare of some coercive power, every man will distrust and dread each other, and as by naturall right he may, so
						by necessity he will be forced to make use of the strength hee hath, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0040"/> toward the preservation of himself You will object perhaps, that
						there are some who deny this; truly so it happens, that very many do deny it. But shall I therefore seem to fight against my self because I affirm that the same men
						confesse, and deny the same thing? In truth I do not, but they do, whose actions disavow what their discourses approve; of We see all countries though they be at peace
						with their neighbours, yet guarding their Frontiers with armed men, their Townes with Walls and ports, and keeping constant watches. To what purpose is all this, if
						there be no feare of the neighbouring power? Wee see even in well-governed States, where there are lawes and punishments appointed for offendors, yet particular men
						travell not without their Sword by their sides, for their defences, neither sleep they without shutting not only their doores against their fellow Subjects, but also
						their Trunks and Coffers for feare of domestiques. Can men give a clearer testimony of the distrust they have each of other, and all, of all? How since they doe thus,
						and even Countreyes as well as men, they publiquely professe their mutuall feare and diffidence; <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0041"/> But in disputing they deny it, thats
						as much as to say, that out of a desire they have to contradict others, they gainsay themselves. Some object that this principle being admitted, it would needs follow,
						not onely that all men were wicked (which perhaps though it seeme hard, yet we must yeeld to, since it is so clearly declar'd by holy writ) but also wicked by nature
						(which cannot be granted without impiety). But this, that men are evill by nature, followes not from this principle; for though the wicked were fewer then the
						righteous, yet because we cannot distinguish them, there is a necessity of suspecting, heeding, anticipating, subjugating, selfe-defending, ever incident to the most
						honest, and fairest condition'd; much lesse do's it follow that those who are wicked are so by nature, for though from nature, that is from their first birth, as they
						are meerly sensible Creatures, they have this disposition, that immediately as much as in them lies, they desire and doe whatsoever is best pleasing to them, that
						either through feare they fly from, or through hardnesse repell those dangers which approach them, yet are they not for this <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0042"/> reason
						to be accounted wicked; for the affections of the minde which arise onely from the lower parts of the soule are not wicked themselves, but the actions thence proceeding
						may be so sometimes, as when they are either offensive, or against duty. Unlesse you give Children all they aske for, they are peevish, and cry, I and strike their
						parents sometimes, and all this they have from nature, yet are they free from guilt, neither may we properly call them wicked; first, because they cannot hurt; next,
						because wanting the free use of reason they are exempted from all duty; these when they come to riper yeares having acquired power whereby they may doe hurt, if they
						shall continue to doe the same things, then truly they both begin to be, and are properly accounted wicked; In so much as a wicked man is almost the same thing with a
						childe growne strong and sturdy, or a man of a childish disposition; and malice the same with a defect of reason in that age, when nature ought to be better governed
						through good education and experience. Unlesse therefore we will say that men are naturally evill, because <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0043"/> they receive not their
						education and use of reason from nature, we must needs acknowledge that men may derive desire, feare, anger, and other passions from nature, and yet not impute the
						evill effects of those unto nature. The foundation therefore which I have laid standing firme, I demonstrate in the first place, that the state of men without civill
						society (which state we may properly call the state of nature) is nothing else but a meere warre of all against all; and in that warre all men have equall right unto
						all things; Next, that all men as soone as they arrive to understanding of this hatefull condition, doe desire (even nature it selfe compelling them) to be freed from
						this misery. But that this cannot be done except by compact, they all quitt that right which they have unto all things. Furthermore I declare, and confirme what the
						nature of compacts is; how and by what meanes the right of one might be transfer'd unto another to make their compacts valid; also what rights, and to whom they must
						necessarily be granted for the establishing of peace, I meane what those dictates of reason are, which may properly <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0044"/> be term'd the
						Lawes of nature; and all these are contain'd in that part of this booke which I entitle </hi>Liberty. </p>
				<p><hi rend="italic"> These grounds thus layd, I shew farther what civill government, and the supreme power in it, and the divers kinds of it are; by what meanes it becomes
						so, &amp; what rights particular men, who intend to constitute this civill government, must so necessarily transfer from themselves on the supreme power, whether it
						be one man, or an assembly of men, that except they doe so it will evidently appeare to be no civill government, but the rights which all men have to all things, that
						is the rights of tarre will still remaine. Next, I distinguish the divers kindes of it, to wit, Monarchie, Aristocratie, Democratie, and paternall Dominion, and that of
						Masters over their Servants; I declare how they are constituted, and I compare their severall conveniences and inconveniences each with. other. furthermore, I unfold
						what those things are which destroy it, and what his or their duty is who rule in chiefe. Last of all, I explicate the natures of the Law, and of sinne, and I
						distinguish <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0045"/> Law from Counsell, from compact, from that which I call Right; all which I comprehend under the title of </hi>Dominion. </p>
				<p>
					<hi rend="italic">In the last part of it which is entituled </hi>Religion, <hi rend="italic">lest that right which by strong reason I had confirm'd the Soveraigne powers
						in the preceding discourse have over their Subjects, might seem to be repugnant to the sacred Scriptures, I shew in the first place how it repugns not the Divine right,
						for as much as God overrules all rulers by nature, (i.e.) by the Dictates of naturall reason. In the second, for as much as God himselfe had a peculiar dominion over
						the</hi> Jewes <hi rend="italic">by vertue of that antient Covenant of Circumcision. In the third, because God doth now rule over us Christians by vertue of our
						Covenant of Baptisme; and therefore the authority of Rulers in chiefe, or of civill government, is not at all, we see, contrary to Religion.</hi>
				</p>
				<p><hi rend="italic"> In the last place I declare what duties are necessarily requir'd from us, to enter into the</hi> Kingdome of Heaven;<hi rend="italic"> and of those I
						plainly demonstrate, and conclude out of evident testimonies of holy writ, according <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0046"/> to the interpretation made by all, that the
						obedience which I have affirm'd to be due from particular Christian Subjects unto their Christian princes cannot possibly in the least sort be repugnant unto Christian
						Religion. You have seene my Method, receive now the reason which mov'd me to write this; I was studying</hi> Philosophie <hi rend="italic">for my minde sake, and I had
						gathered together its first Elements in all kinds, and having digested them into three Sections by degrees, I thought to have written them so as in the first I would
						have treated of a body, and its generall properties; in the second of man and his speciall faculties, and affections; in the third, of civill government and the duties
						of Subjects: therefore the first Section would have contained the first philosophie, and certaine elements of physick; in it we would have considered the reasons of
						Time, Place, Cause, Power, Relation, Proportion, Quantity, Figure, and motion. In the second we would have beene conversant about imagination, Memory, intellect,
						ratiocination, appetite, till, good and Evill, honest and dishonest, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0047"/> and the like. what this last Section handles, I have now already
						shewed you. Whilest I contrive, order, pensively and slowly compose these matters, for I onely doe reason, I dispute not, it so happen'd in the interim, that my Country
						some few yeares before the civill tarres did rage, was boyling hot with questions concerning the rights of Dominion, and the obedience due from Subjects, the true
						forerunners of an approaching tar. And was the cause which (all those other matters deferr'd) ripen'd, and pluckt from me this third part. Therefore it happens that
						what was last in order, is yet come forth first in time, and the rather, because I saw that grounded on its owne principles sufficiently knowne by experience it would
						not stand in need of the former Sections. I have not yet made it out of a desire of praise (although if I had, I might have defended my selfe with this faire excuse,
						that very few doe things laudably, who are not affected with commendation) but for your sakes Readers, who I perswaded my selfe, when you should rightly apprehend and
						throughly understand <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0048"/> this Doctrine I here present you with, would rather chuse to brooke with patience some inconveniences under
						government (because humane affairs cannot possibly be without some) then selfe opiniatedly disturb the quiet of the publique; That, weighing the justice of those things
						you are about, not by the perswasion and advise of private men, but by the Lawes of the Realme, you will no longer suffer ambitious men through the streames of your
						blood to wade to their owne power; That you will esteeme it better to enjoy your selves in the present state though perhaps not the best, then by waging tarre,
						indeavour to procure a reformation for other men in another age, your selves in the meane while either kill'd, or consumed with age; Farthermore, for those who will not
						acknowledge themselves subject to the civill Magistrate, and will be exempt from all publique burthens, and yet will live under his Jurisdiction, and look for
						protection from the violence and injuries of others, that you would not looke on them as fellow Subjects, but esteeme them for enemies, and spies, and that yee <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0049"/> rashly admit not for Gods Word all which either openly or privately they shall pretend to bee so. I say more plainly, if any preacher,
						Confessor, or Casuist, shal but say that this doctrin is agreeable with Gods word, namely, That the chief ruler, nay any private man may lawfully be put to death
						without the chiefes command, or that Subjects may resist, conspire, or covenant against the supreme power, that ye by no means beleeve them, but instantly declare their
						names. He who approves of these reasons, will also like my intention in writing this book.</hi>
				</p>
				<p><hi rend="italic"> Last of al, I have propounded to my self this rule through this whole discourse; First, not to define ought which concerns the justice of single
						actions, but leave them to be determined by the laws. Next not to dispute the laws of any government in special, that is, not to point which are the laws of any
						country, but to declare what the laws of all countries are. Thirdly not to seem of opinion, that there is a lesse proportion of for obedience due to an</hi>
						Aristocraty<hi rend="italic"> or</hi> Democraty,<hi rend="italic"> then a Monarchy; though I have endeavoured by arguments in my tenth Chapter to gain a belief in men,
						that <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0050"/> Monarchy is the most commodious government (which one thing alone I confesse in this whole book not to be demonstrated, but only
						probably stated) yet every where I expresly say, that in all kind of Government whatsoever, there ought to be a supreme and equall power. Fourthly, not in any wise to
						dispute the positions of Divines, except those which strip Subjects of their obedience, and shake the foundations of civill government. Lastly, lest I might imprudently
						set forth somewhat of which there would be no need, what I had thus written, I would not presently expose to publique interest, wherefore I got some few copies
						privately disperst among some of my friends, that discrying the opinions of others, if any things appeared erroneous, hard, or obscure, I might correct, soften, and
						explain them.</hi>
				</p>
				<p>
					<hi rend="italic"> These things I found most bitterly excepted against: that I had made the civill powers too large, but this by Ecclesiasticall persons; that I had
						utterly taken away liberty of conscience, but this by Sectaries; that I had set </hi>Princes<hi rend="italic"> above the civil Laws, but this by Lawyers; wherefore I
						was not much moved by these mens reprehensions, (as who in <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0051"/> doing this did but do their own business) except it were tye those knots
						so much faster.</hi>
				</p>
				<p>
					<hi rend="italic">But for their sakes who have a litle been staggered at the principles themselves, to wit the nature of men, the authority or right of nature, the nature
						of compacts and contracts, and the originall of civill government, because in finding fault they have not so much followed their passions, as their common sense, I have
						therefore in some places added some annotations whereby I presumed I might give some satisfaction to their differing thoughts; Lastly I have endevoured to offend none
						beside those whose principles these contradict, and whose tender mindes are lightly offended by every difference of opinions.</hi>
				</p>
				<p>
					<hi rend="italic"> Wherefore if ye shall meet with some things which have more of sharpnesse, and lesse of certainty then they ought to have, since they are not so much
						spoken for the maintenance of parties, as the establishment of peace, and by one whose just grief for the present calamities of his country, may very charitably be
						allowed some liberty, it is his only request to ye Readers, ye will deign to receive them with an equall mind.</hi>

					<head>Of the State of Men Without Civill Society</head>

					<p> I. The faculties of Humane nature may be reduc'd unto four kinds; Bodily strength, Experience, Reason, Passion. Taking the beginning of this following Doctrine from
						these, we will declare in the first place what manner of inclinations men who are endued with these faculties bare towards each other, and whether, and by what faculty,
						they are born apt for Society, and so preserve themselves against mutuall violence; then proceeding, we will shew what <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0058" n="3"/> advice
						was necessary to be taken for this businesse, and what are the conditions of Society, or of Humane Peace; that is to say, (changing the words onely) what are the
						fundamentall <hi rend="italic">Lawes of Nature.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> II. The greatest part of those men who have written ought concerning Commonwealths, either suppose, or require us, or beg of us to believe, That Man is a Creature
						born fit for Society: The Greeks call him <foreign lang="gre">
							<hi rend="italic">&zgr;&#x1FF6;&ogr;&ngr; &pgr;&ogr;&lgr;&igr;&tgr;&igr;&kgr;&ogr;&ngr;</hi>
						</foreign>, and on this foundation they so build up the Doctrine of Civill Society, as if for the preservation of Peace, and the Government of Man-kind there were
						nothing else necessary, then that Men should agree to make certaine Covenants and Conditions together, which themselves should then call Lawes. Which Axiom, though
						received by most, is yet certainly False, and an Errour proceeding from our too slight contemplation of Humane Nature; for they who shall more narrowly look into the
						Causes for which Men come together, and delight in each others company, shall easily find that this happens not because naturally it could happen no otherwise, but by
						Accident: For if by nature one Man should Love another (that is) as Man, there could no reason be return'd why every Man should not equally Love every Man, as being
						equally Man, or why he should rather frequent those whose Society affords him Honour or Profit. We doe not therefore by nature seek Society for its own sake, but that
						we may receive some Honour or Profit from it; these we desire Primarily, that Secondarily: How by what <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0059" n="4"/> advice Men doe meet,
						will be best known by observing those things which they doe when they are met: For if they meet for Traffique, it's plaine every man regards not his Fellow, but his
						Businesse; if to discharge some Office, a certain Market-friendship is begotten, which hath more of Jealousie in it then True love, and whence Factions sometimes may
						arise, but Good will never; if for Pleasure, and Recreation of mind, every man is wont to please himself most with those things which stirre up laughter, whence he may
						(according to the nature of that which is Ridiculous) by comparison of another mans Defects and Infirmities, passe the more currant in his owne opinion; and although
						this be sometimes innocent, and without offence; yet it is manifest they are not so much delighted with the Society, as their own Vain glory. But for the most part, in
						these kind of meetings, we wound the absent; their whole life, sayings, actions are examin'd, judg'd, condemn'd; nay, it is very rare, but some present receive a fling
						before they part, so as his reason was not ill, who was wont alwayes at parting to goe out last. And these are indeed the true delights of Society, unto which we are
						carryed by nature, (i.e.) by those passions which are incident to all Creatures, untill either by sad experience, or good precepts, it so fall out (which in many never
						happens) that the Appetite, of present matters, be dul'd with the memory of things past, without which, the discourse of most quick and nimble men, on this subject, is
						but cold and hungry. <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0060" n="5"/>
					</p>
					<p> But if it so happen, that being met, they passe their time in relating some Stories, and one of them begins to tell one which concernes himselfe; instantly every one
						of the rest most greedily desires to speak of himself too. if one relate some wonder, the rest will tell you miracles, if they have them, if not, they'l fein them:
						Lastly, that I may say somewhat of them who pretend to be wiser then others; if they meet to talk of Philosophy, look how many men, so many would be esteem'd Masters,
						or else they not only love not their fellowes, but even persecute them with hatred: So clear is it by experience to all men who a little more narrowly consider Humane
						affaires, that all free congress ariseth either from mutual poverty, or from vain glory, whence the parties met, endeavour to carry with them either some benefit, or to
						leave behind them that same <foreign lang="gre">
							<hi rend="italic">&#x1F10;&ugr;&dgr;&ogr;&kgr;&igr;&mgr;&egr;&#x1FD6;&ngr;</hi>
						</foreign> some esteem and honour with those, with whom they have been conversant: The same is also collected by reason out of the definitions themselves, of<hi
							rend="italic"> Will, Good, Honour, Profitable</hi>. For when we voluntarily contract Society, in all manner of Society we look after the object of the Will, i.e.
						that, which every one of those, who gather together, propounds to himselfe for good; now whatsoever seemes good, is pleasant, and relates either to the senses, or the
						mind, but all the mindes pleasure is either Glory, (or to have a good opinion of ones selfe) or referres to Glory in the end; the rest are Sensuall, or conducing to
						sensuality, which may be all comprehended under the word Conveniencies. All Society <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0061" n="6"/> therefore is either for Gain, or for Glory;
						(i.e.) not so much for love of our Fellowes, as for love of our Selves: but no society can be great, or lasting, which begins from Vain Glory; because that Glory is
						like Honour, if all, men have it, no man hath it, for they consist in comparison and precellence; neither doth the society of others advance any whit the cause of my
						glorying in my selfe; for every man must account himself, such as he can make himselfe, without the help of others. But though the benefits of this life may be much
						farthered by mutuall help, since yet those may be better attain'd to by Dominion, then by the society of others: I hope no body will doubt but that men would much more
						greedily be carryed by Nature, if all fear were removed, to obtain Dominion, then to gaine Society. We must therefore resolve, that the Originall of all great, and
						lasting Societies, consisted not in the mutuall good will men had towards each other, but in the mutuall fear they had of each other. </p>
					<p> Born fit] <hi rend="italic">Since we now see actually a constituted Society among men, and none living out of it, since we discern all desirous of congresse, and
							mutuall correspondence, it may seeme a wonderfull kind of stupidity, to lay in the very threshold of this Doctrine, such a stumbling block before the Readers, as to
							deny</hi> Man to be born fit for Society:<hi rend="italic"> Therefore I must more plainly say, That it is true indeed, that to Man, by nature, or as Man, that is, as
							soone as he is born, Solitude is an enemy; for Infants have need of others to help them to live, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0062" n="7"/> and those of riper years to
							help them to live well, wherefore I deny not that men (even nature compelling) desire to come together. But civill Societies are not meer Meetings, but Bonds, to the
							making whereof, Faith and Compacts are necessary: The Vertue whereof to Children, and Fooles, and the profit whereof to those who have not yet tasted the miseries
							which accompany its defects, is altogether unknown; whence it happens, that those, because they know not what Society is, cannot enter into it; these, because
							ignorant of the benefit it brings, care not for it. Manifest therefore it is, that all men, because they are born in Infancy, are born unapt for Society. Many also
							(perhaps most men) either through defect of minde, or want of education remain unfit during the whole course of their lives; yet have Infants, as well as those of
							riper years, an humane nature; wherefore Man is made fit for Society not by Nature, but by Education: furthermore, although Man were born in such a condition as to
							desire it, it followes not, that he therefore were Born fit to enter into it; for it is one thing to desire, another to be in capacity fit for what we desire; for
							even they, who through their pride, will not stoop to equall conditions, without which there can be no Society, do yet desire it.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> The mutuall fear] <hi rend="italic">It is objected: It is so improbable that men should grow into civill Societies out of fear, that if they had been afraid, they
							would not have endur'd each others looks: They Presume, I believe, that to fear is nothing else then to be affrighted: I comprehend in this word Fear, a certain
							foresight of future evill; neither doe I conceive flight the sole property of fear, but to distrust, suspect, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0063" n="8"/> take heed,
							provide so that they may not fear, is also incident to the fearfull. They who go to Sleep, shut their Dores; they who Travell carry their Swords with them, because
							they fear Theives. Kingdomes guard their Coasts and Frontiers with Forts, and Castles; Cities are compast with Walls, and all for fear of neighbouring Kingdomes and
							Townes; even the strongest Armies, and most accomplisht for Fight, yet sometimes Parly for Peace, as fearing each others Power, and lest they might be overcome. It is
							through fear that men secure themselves, by flight indeed, and in corners, if they think they cannot escaPe otherwise, but for the most part by Armes, and Defensive
							Weapons; whence it happens, that daring to come forth, they know each others Spirits; but then, if they fight, Civill Society ariseth from the Victory, if they agree,
							from their Agreement.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> III. The cause of mutuall fear consists partly in the naturall equality of men, partly in their mutuall will of hurting: whence it comes to passe that we can neither
						expect from others, nor promise to our selves the least security: For if we look on men fullgrown, and consider how brittle the frame of our humane body is, (which
						perishing, all its strength, vigour, and wisdome it selfe perisheth with it) and how easie a matter it is, even for the weakest man to kill the strongest, there is no
						reason why any man trusting to his own strength should conceive himself made by nature above others: they are equalls who can doe equall things one against the other;
						but they who can do the greatest things, (namely kill) can doe equall things. All men therefore among <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0064" n="9"/> themselves are by nature
						equall; the inequality we now discern, hath its spring from the Civill Law. </p>
					<p> IV. All men in the State of nature have a desire, and will to hurt, but not proceeding from the same cause, neither equally to be condemn'd; for one man according to
						that naturall equality which is among us, permits as much to others, as he assumes to himself (which is an argument of a temperate man, and one that rightly values his
						power); another, supposing himselfe above others, will have a License to doe what he lists, and challenges Respect, and Honour, as due to him before others, (which is
						an Argument of a fiery spirit:) This mans will to hurt ariseth from Vain glory, and the false esteeme he hath of his owne strength; the other's, from the necessity of
						defending himselfe, his liberty, and his goods against this mans violence. </p>
					<p> V. Furthermore, since the combate of Wits is the fiercest, the greatest discords which are, must necessarily arise from this Contention; for in this case it is not
						only odious to contend against, but also not to consent; for not to approve of what a man saith is no lesse then tacitely to accuse him of an Errour in that thing which
						he speaketh; as in very many things to dissent, is as much as if you accounted him a fool whom you dissent from; which may appear hence, that there are no Warres so
						sharply wag'd as between Sects of the same Religion, and Factions of the same Commonweale, where the Contestation is Either concerning Doctrines, or Politique Prudence.
							<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0065" n="10"/> And since all the pleasure, and jollity of the mind consists in this; even to get some, with whom comparing, it may find
						somewhat wherein to Tryumph, and Vaunt it self; its impossible but men must declare sometimes some mutuall scorn and contempt either by Laughter, or by Words, or by
						Gesture, or some signe or other. then which there is no greater vexation of mind; and then from which there cannot possibly arise a greater desire to doe hurt. </p>
					<p> VI. But the most frequent reason why men desire to hurt each other, ariseth hence, that many men at the same time have an Appetite to the same thing; which yet very
						often they can neither enjoy in common, nor yet divide it; whence it followes that the strongest must have it, and who is strongest must be decided by the Sword. </p>
					<p> VII. Among so many dangers therefore, as the naturall lusts of men do daily threaten each other withall, to have a care of ones selfe is not a matter so scornfully to
						be lookt upon, as if so be there had not been a power and will left in one to have done otherwise; for every man is desirous of what is good for him, and shuns what is
						evill, but chiefly the chiefest of naturall evills, which is Death; and this he doth, by a certain impulsion of nature, no lesse then that whereby a Stone moves
						downward: It is therefore neither absurd, nor reprehensible; neither against the dictates of true reason for a man to use all his endeavours to preserve and defend his
						Body, and the Members thereof from death and sorrowes; but that which is not contrary <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0066" n="11"/> to right reason, that all men account to
						be done justly, and with right; Neither by the word Right is any thing else signified, then that liberty which every man hath to make use of his naturall faculties
						according to right reason: Therefore the first foundation of naturall <hi rend="italic">Right</hi> is this, That<hi rend="italic"> every man as much as in him lies
							endeavour to protect his</hi> life and members. </p>
					<p> VIII. But because it is in vaine for a man to have a<hi rend="italic"> Right</hi> to the end, if the <hi rend="italic">Right</hi> to the necessary meanes be deny'd
						him; it followes, that since every man hath a Right to preserve himself, he must also be allowed a <hi rend="italic">Right to use all the means, and do all the actions,
							without wHich He cannot preserve himself.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> IX. Now whether the means which he is about to use, and the action he is performing, be necessary to the preservation of his Life, and Members, or not,<hi
							rend="italic"> he himself</hi>, by the right of nature, must <hi rend="italic">be judg</hi>; for say another man, judg that it is contrary to right reason that I
						should judg of mine own perill: why now, because he judgeth of what concerns me, by the same reason, because we are equall by nature, will I judge also of things which
						doe belong to him; therefore it agrees with right reason (that is) it is the right of nature that I judge of his opinion, (i.e.) whether it conduce to my preservation,
						or not. </p>
					<p> X. Nature hath given to <hi rend="italic">every one a right to all</hi>. That is it was lawfull for every man in the bare state of nature, or before such time as men
						had engag'd themselves by any Covenants, or Bonds, to doe <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0067" n="12"/> what hee would, and against whom he thought fit, and to possesse,
						use, and enjoy all what he would, or could get. Now because whatsoever a man would, it therefore seems good to him because he wills it, and either it really doth, or at
						least seems to him to contribute toward his preservation, (but we have already allowed him to be judge in the foregoing Article whether it doth or not, in so much as we
						are to hold all for necessary whatsoever he shall esteeme so) and by the 7. Article it appeares that <hi rend="italic">by the right of Nature</hi> those things may be
						done, and must be had, which necessarily conduce to the protection of life, and members, it followes, that in the state of nature, To have all, and do all is lawfull
						for all. And this is that which is meant by that common saying, <hi rend="italic">Nature hath given all to all</hi>, from whence we understand likewise, that in the
						state of nature, Profit is the measure of <hi rend="italic">Right</hi>. </p>
					<p> In the meere state of Nature] <hi rend="italic">This is thus to be understood: What any man does in the bare state of Nature is injurious to no man; not that in such
							a State he cannot offend God, or break the Lawes of Nature; for Injustice against men presupposeth Humane Lawes, such, as in the State of Nature there are none: Now
							the truth of this proposition thus conceived is sufficiently demonstrated to the mindfull Reader in the Articles immediately foregoing; but because in certaine cases
							the difficulty of the conclusion makes us forget the premises, I will contract this Argument, and make it most evident to a single view; every man hath right to
							protect himself, as appears by the seventh Article. The same man therefore hath a right to <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0068" n="13"/> use all the means which
							necessarily conduce to this end by the eight Article: But those are the necessary means which he shall judge to be such by the ninth Article. He therefore hath a
							right to make use, of and to doe all whatsoever he shall judge requisite for his preservation: wherefore by the judgement of him that doth it, the thing done is
							either right, or wrong; and therefore right. True it is therefore in the bare State of Nature, &amp;c but if any man pretend somewhat to tend necessarily to his
							preservation, which yet he himself doth not confidently believe so, he may offend against the Lawes of Nature, as in the third Chapter of this Book is more at large
							declar'd. It hath been objected by some: If a Sonne kill his Father, doth he him no injury? I have answered, That a Sonne cannot be understood to be at any time in
							the State of Nature, as being under the Power and command of them to whom he ownes his protection as soon as ever he is born, namely either his Fathers, or his
							Mothers, or his that nourisht him, as is demonstrated in the ninth Chapter.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> XI. But it was the least benefit for men thus to have a common <hi rend="italic">Right to all things</hi>; for the effects of this <hi rend="italic">Right</hi> are
						the same, almost, as if there had been no <hi rend="italic">Right</hi> at all; for although any man might say of every thing,<hi rend="italic"> This is mine</hi>, yet
						could he not enjoy it, by reason of his Neighbour, who having equall<hi rend="italic"> Right,</hi> and equall power, would pretend the same thing to be his. </p>
					<p> XII. If now to this naturall proclivity of men, to hurt each other, which they derive from their Passions, but chiefly from a vain esteeme of themselves: You adde,
						the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0069" n="14"/> right of all to all, wherewith one <hi rend="italic">by right</hi> invades, the other<hi rend="italic"> by right </hi>
						resists, and whence arise perpetuall jealousies and suspicions on all hands, and how hard a thing it is to provide against an enemy invading us, with an intention to
						oppresse, and ruine, though he come with a small Number, and no great Provision;. it cannot be deny'd but that the naturall state of men, before they entr'd into
						Society, was a meer War, and that not simply, but a War of all men, against all men; for what is WAR, but that same time in which the will of contesting by force, is
						fully declar'd either by Words, or Deeds? The time remaining, is termed PEACE. </p>
					<p> XIII. But it is easily judg'd how disagreeable a thing to the preservation either of Man-kind, or of each single Man, a perpetuall<hi rend="italic">War</hi> is: But
						it is perpetuall in its own nature, because in regard of the equality of those that strive, it cannot be ended by Victory; for in this state the Conquerour is subject
						to so much danger, as it were to be accounted a Miracle, if any, even the most strong should close up his life with many years, and old age. They of <hi rend="italic"
							>America</hi> are Examples hereof, even in this present Age: Other Nations have been in former Ages, which now indeed are become Civill, and Flourishing, but were
						then few, fierce, short-lived, poor, nasty, and destroy'd of all that Pleasure, and Beauty of life, which <hi rend="italic">Peace</hi> and Society are wont to bring
						with them. Whosoever therefore holds, that it had been best to have continued in that state in which all things <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0070" n="15"/> were lawfull
						for all men, he contradicts himself; for every man, by naturall necessity desires that which is good for him: nor is there any that esteemes a<hi rend="italic">
						war</hi> of all against all, which necessarily adheres to such a State, to be good for him. And so it happens that through feare of each other we think it fit to rid
						our selves of this condition, and to get some fellowes; that if there needs must be <hi rend="italic">war</hi>, it may not yet be against all men, nor without some
						helps. </p>
					<p> XIV. Fellowes are gotten either by constraint, or by consent; By Constraint, when after fight the Conqueror makes the conquered serve him either through feare of
						death, or by laying fetters on him: By consent, when men enter into society to helpe each other, both parties consenting without any constraint. But the Conqueror may
						by right compell the Conquered, or the strongest the weaker, (as a man in health may one that is sick, or he that is of riper yeares a childe) unlesse he will choose to
						die, to give caution of his future obedience. For since the right of protecting our selves according to our owne wills proceeded from our danger, and our danger from
						our equality, its more consonant to reason, and more certaine for our conservation, using the present advantage to secure our selves by taking caution; then, when they
						shall be full growne and strong, and got out of our power, to endeavour to recover that power againe by doubtfull fight. And on the other side, nothing can be thought
						more absurd, then by discharging whom you already have weak in your power, to make <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0071" n="16"/> him at once both an enemy, and a strong
						one. From whence we may understand likewise as a Corollarie in the naturall state of men, That <hi rend="italic">a sure and irresistible Power confers the right of
							Dominion, and ruling over those who cannot resist</hi>; insomuch, as the right of all things, that can be done, adheres essentially, and immediately unto this
						omnipotence hence arising. </p>
					<p> XV. Yet cannot men expect any lasting preservation continuing thus in the state of nature (i.e.) of<hi rend="italic"> War</hi>, by reason of that equality of power,
						and other humane faculties they are endued withall. Wherefore to seek Peace, where there is any hopes of obtaining it, and where there is none, to enquire out for
						Auxiliaries of War, is the dictate of right Reason; that is, the Law of Nature, as shall be shewed in the next Chapter.</p>

					<lb/>
					<p>I. All Authors agree not concerning the definition <hi rend="italic">of the Naturall Law</hi>, who notwithstanding doe very often make use of this terme in their
						Writings. The Method therefore, wherein we begin from definitions, and exclusion of all equivocation, is only proper to them who leave no place for contrary Disputes;
						for the rest, if any man say, that somwhat is done against the Law of Nature, one proves it hence, because it was done against the generall Agreement of all the most
						wise, and learned Nations: But this declares not who shall be the judg of the wisdome and learning of <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0074" n="19"/>all Nations: Another hence, That it was done against the Generall
						consent of all <hi rend="italic">Man-kind</hi>; which definition is by no means to be admitted; for then it were impossible for any but Children, and Fools, to offend
						against such a Law; for sure, under the notion of Man-kind, they comprehend all men actually endued with Reason. These therefore either doe Naught against it, or if
						they doe Ought, it is without their joint accord, and therefore ought to be excus'd; but to receive the Lawes of Nature from the Consents of them, who oftner Break,
						then Observe them, is in truth unreasonable: besides, Men condemne the same things in others, which they approve in themselves; on the other side, they publickly
						commend what they privately condemne; and they deliver their Opinions more by Hear-say, then any Speculation of their own; and they accord more through hatred of some
						object, through fear, hope, love, or some other perturbation of mind, then true Reason. And therefore it comes to passe, that whole Bodyes of people often doe those
						things by Generall accord, or Contention, which those Writers most willingly acknowledge to be against the <hi rend="italic">Law of Nature</hi>. But since all doe grant
						that is done by RIGHT, which is not done against Reason, we ought to judg those Actions onely <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>, which are repugnant to right Reason, (i.e.)
						which contradict some certaine Truth collected by right reasoning from true Principles; but that <hi rend="italic">Wrong</hi> which is done, we say it is done against
						some Law: therefore <hi rend="italic">True Reason</hi> is <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0075" n="20"/>a certaine <hi rend="italic">Law</hi>, which (since it is no lesse a part of Humane nature, then any other
						faculty, or affection of the mind) is also termed naturall. Therefore the<hi rend="italic"> Law of Nature</hi>, that I may define it, is the Dictate of right Reason,
						conversant about those things which are either to be done, or omitted for the constant preservation of Life, and Members, as much as in us lyes. </p>
					<p> Right Reason.]<hi rend="italic"> By Right Reason in the naturall state of men, I understand not, as many doe, an infallible faculty, but the act of reasoning, that
							is, the peculiar and true ratiocination of every man concerning those actions of his which may either redound to the dammage, or benefit of his neighbours. I call it
							Peculiar, because although in a Civill Government the reason of the Supreme (i.e. the Civill Law) is to be received by each single subject for the right; yet being
							without this Civill Government, (in which state no man can know right reason from false, but by comparing it with His owne) every mans owne reason is to be accounted
							not onely the rule of His owne actions which are done at His owne perill, but also for the measure of another mans reason, in such things as doe concerne him. I call
							it True; that is, concluding from true principles rightly fram'd, because that the wHole breach of the Lawes of Nature consists in the false reasoning, or rather
							folly of those men who see not those duties they are necessarily to performe toward others in order to their owne conservation; but the Principles of Right reasoning
							about such like duties are those which are explained in the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. articles of the first Chapter.</hi><pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0076" n="21"/>
					</p>
					<p> II. But the first and fundamentall <hi rend="italic">Law of Nature is, That Peace is to be sought after where it may be found; and where not, there to provide our
							selves for helps of War: </hi>For we shewed in the last Article of the foregoing Chapter, that this precept is the dictate of right reason; but that the Dictates of
						right reason are naturall Lawes, that hath been newly prov'd above; But this is the first, because the rest are deriv'd from this, and they direct the wayes either to
						Peace, or self-defence. </p>
					<p> III. But one of the <hi rend="italic">Naturall Lawes</hi> deriv'd from this fundamentall one is this,<hi rend="italic"> That the right of all men, to all things,
							ought not to be retain'd, but that some certain rights ought to be transferr'd, or relinquisht:</hi> for if every one should retain his <hi rend="italic">right to all
							things,</hi> it must necessarily follow, that some <hi rend="italic">by right</hi> might invade; and others, by the same right, might defend themselves against them,
						(for every man, by naturall necessity, endeavours to defend his Body, and the things which he judgeth necessary towards the protection of his Body) therefore <hi
							rend="italic">War</hi> would follow. He therefore acts against the reason of Peace, (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>) against the <hi rend="italic">Law of Nature</hi>,
						whosoever he be, that doth not part with his <hi rend="italic">Right to all things</hi>. </p>
					<p> IV. But he is said to <hi rend="italic">part with his right</hi>, who either <hi rend="italic">absolutely renounceth it</hi>, or conveys it to another. He absolutely
						renounceth it, who by some sufficient Signe, or meet Tokens, declares that he is willing that it shall never be lawfull for him to doe that again, which before,<hi
							rend="italic"> by Right</hi>, he might have done; but he<hi rend="italic"> conveys</hi> it to another, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0077" n="22"/>who by some sufficient Signe, or meet Tokens, declares to that
						other, that he is willing it should be unlawfull for him to resist him, in going about to do somewhat in the performance where he might before, <hi rend="italic">with
							Right,</hi> have resisted him; but that the <hi rend="italic">conveyance of Right</hi> consists meerly in not resisting, is understood by this, that before it was <hi
							rend="italic">convey'd</hi>, he, to whom he convey'd it, had even then also a right to all, whence he could not give any new <hi rend="italic">Right</hi>: But the
						resisting <hi rend="italic">Right</hi> he had, before he gave it, by reason whereof the other could not freely enjoy his <hi rend="italic">Rights</hi>, is utterly
						abolisht: Whosoever therefore acquires some <hi rend="italic">Right</hi> in the naturall state of men, he onely procures himself security, and freedome from just
						molestation in the enjoyment of his <hi rend="italic">Primitive Right</hi>: As for example, if any man shall sell, or give away a Farme, he utterly deprives himself
						only from all <hi rend="italic">Right</hi> to this Farme, but he does not so from others also. </p>
					<p> V. But in the <hi rend="italic">conveyance of Right</hi> the will is requisite not onely of him that conveys, but of him also that accepts it. If either be wanting,
						the Right remaines: for if I would have given what was mine, to one who refus'd to accept of it, I have not therefore either simply renounc'd my Right, or convey'd it
						to any man; for the cause which mov'd me to part with it to this Man was in him onely, not in others too. </p>
					<p> VI. But if there be no other Token extant of our will either to quit, or convey our Right, but onely Words; those words <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0078" n="23"/>must either relate to the <hi rend="italic"
							>present,</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">time past</hi>; for if they be of the <hi rend="italic">future</hi> onely, they convey nothing: for example, he that speaks thus
						of the time to come,<hi rend="italic"> I will give to morrow</hi>, declares openly that yet he hath not given it; so that all this day his right remains, and abides to
						morrow too, unlesse in the interim he actually bestowes it: for what is mine, remains mine till I have parted with it. But if I shall speak of the <hi rend="italic"
							>time present</hi>, suppose thus; <hi rend="italic">I doe give</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">have given</hi> you this to be received to morrow, by these words is
						signified that I have <hi rend="italic">already given it</hi>, and that his Right to receive it <hi rend="italic">to morrow</hi>, is conveyed to him by me <hi
							rend="italic">to day.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> VII. Neverthelesse, although words alone are not sufficient tokens to declare the Will; if yet to words relating to the future, there shall some other signes be
						added, they may become as valid, as if they had been spoken of the present: If therefore, as by reason of those other signes, it appear, that he that speaks of the
						future, intends those words should be effectuall toward the perfect<hi rend="italic"> transferring of his Right,</hi> they ought to be valid; for<hi rend="italic"> the
							conveyance of right</hi> depends not on words, but (as hath been instanc'd in the 4. Article) on the declaration of the Will. </p>
					<p> VIII. If any man conveigh some part of his right to another, and doth not this for some certain benefit received, or for some compact, a conveighance in this kind is
						called a Gift, or<hi rend="italic"> free Donation</hi>. But in free donation those words onely oblige us which signifie <hi rend="italic">the present</hi>, or <hi
							rend="italic">the time past</hi>; <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0079" n="24"/>for if they respect <hi rend="italic">the future</hi>, they oblige not<hi rend="italic"> as words</hi>, for the reason given in the
						foregoing Article: It must needs therefore be, that the Obligation arise from some other tokens of the Will: But, because whatsoever is<hi rend="italic">
						voluntarily</hi> done, is done for some <hi rend="italic">good</hi> to him that <hi rend="italic">wils it</hi>; there can no other token be assigned of the Will to give
						it, except some <hi rend="italic">benefit</hi> either already receiv'd, or to be acquir'd; but is suppos'd, that no such <hi rend="italic">benefit</hi> is acquired, nor
						any compact in being; for if so, it would cease to be a <hi rend="italic">free gift</hi>: It remains therefore, that a<hi rend="italic"> mutuall good turne</hi> without
						agreement be expected; but no signe can be given, that he, who us' d future words toward him who was in no sort engag'd to return a benefit, should desire to have his
						words so understood, as to oblige himselfe thereby. Nor is it suitable to Reason, that those who are easily enclined to doe well to others, should be oblig'd by every
						promise, testifying their present good affection: And for this cause, a promiser in this kind, must be understood to have time to deliberate, and power to change that
						affection as well as he to whom he made that promise, may alter his desert. But he that deliberates, is so farre forth free, nor can be said to have already given: But
						if he promise often, and yet give seldome, he ought to be condemn'd of levity, and be called not a Donour, but Doson. </p>
					<p> IX. But the act of two, or more, mutually <hi rend="italic">conveighing</hi> their <hi rend="italic">Rights</hi>, is call'd a <hi rend="italic">Contract</hi>. But in
						every Contract, either both parties instantly performe what they <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0080" n="25"/>contract for, insomuch as there is no trust had from either to other; or the one performes, the other
						is trusted, or neither performe. Where both parties performe presently, there the Contract is ended, as soon as 'tis performed; but where there is credit given either
						to one, or both, there the party trusted promiseth after-performance; and this kind of promise is called a COVENANT. </p>
					<p> X. But the <hi rend="italic">Covenant</hi> made by the party trusted with him, who hath already performed, although the promise be made by words pointing at the
						future, doth no lesse transfer the right of future time, then if it had been made by words signifying the present, or time past: for the others performance is a most
						manifest signe that he so understood the speech of him whom he trusted, as that he would certainly make performance also at the appointed time; and by this signe the
						party trusted knew himselfe to be thus understood, which, because he hindred not, 'twas an evident token of his Will to performe. The <hi rend="italic">promises</hi>
						therefore which are made for some <hi rend="italic">benefit</hi> received (which are also Covenants) are Tokens of the Will; that is, (as in the foregoing Section hath
						been declared) of the last act of deliberating, whereby the liberty of non-performance is abolisht, and by consequence are obligatory; for where Liberty ceaseth, there
						beginneth Obligation. </p>
					<p> XI. But the Covenants, which are made in contract of mutuall trust, neither party performing out of hand, if there arise a just suspicion in either of them, <pb
						entity="DSSR_000002537_0081" n="26"/>are in
						the state of nature invalid: for he that first performes by reason of the wicked disposition of the greatest part of men studying their owne advantage, either by right,
						or wrong, exposeth himself to the perverse will of him with whom he hath Contracted; for it suites not with reason, that any man should performe first, if it be not
						likely that the other will make good his promise after; which, whether it be probable, or not, he that doubts it, must be judge of, as hath been shewed in the foregoing
						Chapter in the 9. Article. Thus, I say, things stand in the state of nature, but in a Civill State, when there is a power which can compell both parties, he that hath
						contracted to perform first, must first performe; because, that since the other may be compell'd, the cause which made him fear the others non-performance, ceaseth. </p>
					<p> Arise] <hi rend="italic">For, except there appear some new cause of fear, either from somewhat done, or some other token of the till not to performe from the other
							part, it cannot be judg'd to be a just fear; for the cause which was not sufficient to keep him from making Compact, must not suffice to authorize the breach of it,
							being made.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> XII. But from this reason, that in all <hi rend="italic">Free-gifts</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Compacts</hi>, there is an acceptance of the conveighance of <hi
							rend="italic">Right</hi> required: it followes, that no man can <hi rend="italic">Compact</hi> with him who doth not declare his acceptance; and therefore we cannot
						compact with Beasts, neither can we give, or take from them any manner of Right, by reason<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0082" n="27"/> of their want of speech, and understanding, Neither can any man <hi
							rend="italic">Covenant</hi> with God, or be oblig'd to him by Vow, except so far forth as it appeares to him by Holy Scriptures, that he hath substituted certaine men
						who have authority to accept of such like <hi rend="italic">Vowes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Covenants</hi>, as being in Gods stead. </p>
					<p> XIII. Those therefore doe vow in vain, who are in the state of nature, where they are not tyed by any Civill Law, (except by most certain Revelation the Will of God
						to accept their <hi rend="italic">Vow</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Pact</hi>, be made known to them) for if what they <hi rend="italic">Vow</hi>, be contrary to the Law
						of Nature, they are not tyed by their <hi rend="italic">Vow</hi>, for no man is tyed to perform an unlawfull act; but if what is vowed, be commanded by some Law of
						nature, it is not their Vow, but the Law it self which ties them; but if he were free before his vow, either to doe it, or not doe it, his liberty remaines, because
						that the openly declar'd Will of the obliger is requisite to make an obligation by Vow, which in the case propounded is suppos'd not to be: Now I call him the Obliger
						to whom any one is tyed, and the <hi rend="italic">Obliged</hi> him who is tyed. </p>
					<p> XIV. Covenants are made of such things onely as fall under our deliberation, for it can be no Covenant without the Will of the Contractor, but the Will is the last
						act of him who deliberates; <hi rend="italic">Wherefore they onely concerne things possible, and to come;</hi> no man therefore, by his Compact, obligeth himself to an
						impossibility. But yet, though we often Covenant to doe such things as <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0083" n="28"/>then seem' d possible when we promis'd them, which yet afterward appear to be impossible, are we
						therefore freed from all obligation? The reason whereof is, that he who promiseth a future incertainty receives a present benefit; on condition, that he return another
						for it: for his Will, who performes the present benefit hath simply before it, for its object, <hi rend="italic">a certain good</hi> valuable with the thing promised;
						but the thing it selfe not simply, but with condition if it could be done; but if it should so happen, that even this should prove impossible, why then he must perform
						as much as he can. <hi rend="italic">Covenants</hi> therefore oblige us not to perform just the thing it selfe covenanted for, but our utmost endeavour. for this onely
						is, the things themselves are not in our power. </p>
					<p> XV. We are freed from <hi rend="italic">Covenants</hi> two wayes, either by performing, or by being forgiven: By performing, for beyond that we oblig'd not our
						selves. By being for-given, because he whom we oblig'd our selves to by forgiving, is conceiv'd to return us that <hi rend="italic">Right</hi> which we past over to
						him; for, forgiving, implies<hi rend="italic"> giving</hi>: that is, by the fourth Article of this Chapter, a conveyance of Right to him to whom the gift is made. </p>
					<p> XVI. Its an usuall question, Whether <hi rend="italic">Compacts</hi> extorted from us, through fear, do oblige, or not: For example, If to redeeme my life, from the
						power of a Robber, I promise to pay him 100 l. next day; and that I will doe no act whereby to apprehend, and bring him to Justice, whether I am tyed to <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0084" n="29"/>keep promise,
						or not? But though such a <hi rend="italic">Promise</hi> must sometimes be judged to be of no effect, yet it is not to be accounted so, because it proceeded from fear,
						for then it would follow that those <hi rend="italic">promises</hi> which reduc'd men to a civill life, and by which Lawes were made, might likewise be of none effect,
						(for it proceeds from fear of mutuall slaughter, that one man submits himselfe to the Dominion of another:) And he should play the fool finely, who should trust his
						captive covenanting with the price of his redemption. It holds universally true, that promises doe oblige when there is some benefit received; and that to promisee and
						the thing promised, be lawfull: But it is lawfull, for the redemption of my life, both to promise, and to give what I will of mine owne to any man, even to a Thief. We
						are oblig'd therefore. by promises proceeding from fear, except the Civill Law forbid them, by vertue whereof, that which is promised becomes unlawfull. </p>
					<p> XVII. Whosoever shall contract with one to doe, or omit somewhat, and shall after <hi rend="italic">Covenant</hi> the contrary with another; he maketh not the former,
						but the latter <hi rend="italic">Contract</hi> unlawfull: for, he hath no longer <hi rend="italic">Right</hi> to doe, or to omit ought, who by former <hi rend="italic"
							>Contracts</hi> hath conveyed it to another; wherefore he can conveigh no <hi rend="italic">Right</hi> by latter Contracts, and what is promised, is promis'd without
						Right: He is therefore tyed onely to his first <hi rend="italic">Contract</hi>; to break which is unlawfull. </p>
					<p> XVIII. No man is oblig'd by any<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0085" n="30"/> <hi rend="italic"> Contracts</hi> whatsoever not to resist him who shall offer to kill, wound, or any other way hurt his Body; for
						there is in every man a certain high degree of feare through which he apprehends that evill which is done to him to be the greatest, and therefore by naturall necessity
						he shuns it all he can, and 'tis suppos'd he can doe no otherwise: When a man is arrived to this degree of fear, we cannot expect but he will provide for himself either
						by flight, or fight. Since therefore no man is tyed to <hi rend="italic">impossibilities</hi>, they who are threatned either with <hi rend="italic">death</hi> (which is
						the greatest evill to nature) or wounds, or some other bodily hurts, and are not stout enough to bear them, are not obliged to endure them. Farthermore, he that is tyed
						by Contract is trusted, (for Faith only is the Bond of Contracts) but they who are brought to punishment, either Capitall, or more gentle, are fettered, or strongly
						guarded, which is a most certain signe that they seem' d not sufficiently bound from non resistance by their Contracts. Its one thing if I promise thus: If I doe it not
						at the day appointed, kill me. Another thing if thus: If I doe it not, though you should offer to kill me, I will not resist: All men, if need be, contract the first
						way; but there is need sometimes. This second way, none, neither is it ever needfull; for in the meer state of nature, if you have a mind to kill, that state it selfe
						affords you a Right; insomuch as you need not first trust him, if for breach of trust you will afterward kill him. But in a Civill State, where the Right of life, and
						death, and of <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0086" n="31"/>all corporall punishment is with the Supreme; that same Right of killing cannot be granted to any private person. Neither need the Supreme himselfe
						contract with any man patiently to yeeld to his punishment, but onely this, that no man offer to defend others from him. If in the state of nature, as between two
						Cities, there should a Contract be made, on condition of killing, if it were not perform'd, we must presuppose another Contract of not killing before the appointed day.
						Wherefore on that day, if there be no performance, the right of Warre returnes; that is, an hostile state, in which all things are lawfull, and therefore resistance
						also. Lastly, by the contract of not resisting, we are oblig'd of two Evills to make choice of that which seemes the greater; for certaine Death is a greater evill then
						Fighting; but of two Evills it is impossible not to chuse the least: By such a Compact therefore we should be tyed to impossibilities, which is contrary to the very
						nature of compacts. </p>
					<p> XIX. Likewise no man is tyed by any Compacts whatsoever to accuse himself, or any other, by whose dammage he is like to procure himselfe a bitter life; wherefore
						neither is a Father oblig'd to bear witnesse against his Sonne, nor a Husband against his Wife, nor a Sonne against his Father; nor any man against any one, by whose
						meanes he hath his subsistance; for in vain is that testimony which is presum'd to be corrupted from nature; but although no man be tyed to accuse himself by any <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0087" n="32"/>
						compact, yet in a publique tryall he may, by torture, be forc'd to make answer; but such answers are no testimony of the fact, but helps for the searching out of truth;
						insomuch as whether the party tortur'd his answer be true, or false, or whether he answer not at all, whatsoever he doth, he doth it by Right. </p>
					<p> XX. <hi rend="italic">Swearing</hi> is a speech joyned to a promise, whereby the promiser declares his renouncing of Gods mercy, unlesse he perform his word; which
						definition is contained in the words themselves, which have in them the very essence of an <hi rend="italic">Oath,</hi> to wit, <hi rend="italic">so God help me,</hi>
						or other equivalent, as with the Romans,<hi rend="italic"> Doe thou Jupiter so destroy the deceiver, as I slay this same Beast:</hi> neither is this any let, but that
						an Oath may as well sometimes be affirmatory, as promissory; for he that confirmes his affirmation with an <hi rend="italic">Oath</hi>, promiseth that he speaks truth.
						But though in some places it was the fashion for Subjects to Swear by their Kings; that custome took its Originall hence, That those Kings took upon them Divine Honour;
						for <hi rend="italic">Oathes</hi> were therefore introduc'd that by Religion, and consideration of the Divine Power men might have a greater dread of breaking their
						Faiths, then that wherewith they fear men, from whose eyes their actions may lie hid. </p>
					<p> XXI. Whence it followes, that an <hi rend="italic">Oath</hi> must be conceived in that forme which he useth, who takes it; for in vain is any man brought to <hi
						rend="italic">Swear</hi> by a God whom he beleeves not, and therefore neither feares him. For though by the light of nature it <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0088" n="33"/>may be known that there is a God, yet
						no man thinks he is to Swear by him in any other fashion, or by any other name then what is contain'd in the precepts of his own proper, that is, (as he who Swears
						imagines) the true Religion. </p>
					<p> XXII. By the definition of an <hi rend="italic">Oath</hi> we may understand, that a bare <hi rend="italic">Contract</hi> obligeth no lesse, then that to which we are
						Sworn; for it is the <hi rend="italic">contract</hi> which binds us, the <hi rend="italic">Oath</hi> relates to the Divine punishment, which it could not provoke, if
						the breach of contract were not in its selfe unlawfull; but it could not be unlawfull if the <hi rend="italic">Contract</hi> were not obligatory. Furthermore, he that
						renounceth the mercy of God obligeth himselfe not to any punishment, because it is ever lawfull to deprecate the punishment howsoever provok'd, and to enjoy Gods Pardon
						if it be granted. The onely effect therefore of an <hi rend="italic">Oath</hi> is this, To cause men who are naturally inclin'd to break all manner of faith, through
						fear of punishment, to make the more Conscience of their words and actions. </p>
					<p> XXIII. To exact an <hi rend="italic">Oath</hi>, where the breach of contract, if any be made, cannot but be known, and where the party compacted, withall wants not
						power to punish, is to do somewhat more then is necessary unto self-defence, and shewes a mind desirous not so much to benefit it selfe, as to prejudice another. For an
							<hi rend="italic">Oath</hi>, out of the very form of swearing, is taken in order to the provocation of Gods anger, that is to say, of him that is <hi rend="italic"
								>Omnipotent</hi> against those who therefore violate their Faith, because they <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0089" n="34"/> think, that by their own strength they can escape the punishment of men; and of him
						that is <hi rend="italic">Omniscient</hi> against those, who therefore usually break their trust, because they hope that no man shall see them.</p>

					<p>XXXIII.  The Law of Nature is not properly a Law, but as it is delivered in Holy Writ.</p>
					<lb/>
					<p> I. Another of the Lawes of Nature is, to <hi rend="italic">performe Contracts</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">to keep trust</hi>; for it hath been shewed in the foregoing
						Chapter that the Law of Nature commands every man, as a thing necessary, to obtain Peace; to conveigh certain rights from each to other, and that this (as often as it
						shall happen to be done) is called a <hi rend="italic">Contract</hi>: But this is so farre forth onely conducible to peace, as we shall performe Our selves, what we
						contract with others, shall be done, or omitted; and in vaine would Contracts be made, unlesse we stood to them. Because therefore,<hi rend="italic"> to stand to our
						Covenants</hi>, Or <hi rend="italic">to keep faith</hi>, is a thing necessary for the obtaining of peace, it will prove by the second Article of the second <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0092" n="37"/>Chapter to
						be a precept of the <hi rend="italic">naturall Law</hi>. </p>
					<p> II. Neither is there in this matter, any exception of the persons, with whom we Contract, as if they keep no faith with others; Or hold, that none ought to be kept,
						or are guilty of any other kind of vice: for he that Contracts, in that he doth contract, denies that action to be in vaine, and it is against reason for a knowing man
						to doe a thing in vain; and if he think himself not bound to keep it, in thinking so, he affirms the Contract to be made in vain: He therefore, who Contracts with one
						with whom he thinks he is not bound to keep faith, he doth at once think a Contract to be a thing done in vaine, and not in vaine, which is absurd. Either therefore we
						must hold trust with all men, or else not bargain with them; that is, either there must be a declared Warre, Or a sure and faithfull Peace. </p>
					<p> III. The breaking of a <hi rend="italic">Bargain</hi>, as also the taking back of a gift, (which ever consists in some action, Or omission) is called an INJURY: But
						that action, or omission, is called <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi>, insomuch as an <hi rend="italic">injury</hi>, and an<hi rend="italic">unjust</hi> action, or
						omission, signifie the same thing, and both are the same with <hi rend="italic">breach of Contract and trust</hi>: And it seemes the word <hi rend="italic">Iniury</hi>
						came to be given to any action, or omission, because they were <hi rend="italic">without Right</hi>. He that acted, or omitted, having before conveyed bis Right to some
						other. And there is some likenesse between that, which in the common course of life we call <hi rend="italic">Injury</hi>; and that, which in the Schools is usually
						called <hi rend="italic">Absurd</hi>. For even as <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0093" n="38"/>he, who by Arguments is driven to deny the Assertion which he first maintain'd, is said to be brought to an <hi
							rend="italic">Absurdity</hi>; in like manner, he who through weaknesse of mind does, or omits that which before he had by <hi rend="italic">Contract</hi> promis'd not
						to doe, or omit, commits an <hi rend="italic">Injury</hi>, and falls into no lesse contradiction, then he, who in the Schools is reduc'd to an Absurdity. For by
						contracting for some future action, he wills it done; by not doing it, he wills it not done, which is to will a thing done, and not done at the same time, which is a
						contradiction. An <hi rend="italic">Injury</hi> therefore is a kind of <hi rend="italic"> absurdity</hi> in conversation, as an <hi rend="italic">absurdity</hi> is a
						kind of <hi rend="italic">injury</hi> in disputation. </p>
					<p> IV. From these grounds it followes, that an injury can be done to no man but him with whom we enter <hi rend="italic">Covenant</hi>, or to whom somewhat is made over
						by deed of gift, or to whom somwhat is promis'd by way of bargain. And therefore <hi rend="italic">damaging</hi> and <hi rend="italic">injuring</hi> are often
						disjoyn'd: for if a Master command his Servant, who hath <hi rend="italic">promis'd</hi> to obey him, to pay a summe of money, or carry some present to a third man; the
						Servant, if he doe it not, hath indeed <hi rend="italic">damag'd</hi> this third party, but he <hi rend="italic">injur'd</hi> his Master onely. So also in a civill
						government, if any man offend another, with whom he hath made no Contract, he damages him to whom the evill is done, but he injures none but him to whom the power of
						government belongs: for if he, who receives the hurt, should expostulate the mischief. and he that did it, should answer thus, What art thou to me? Why should I rather
						doe <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0094" n="39"/>according to yours, then mine owne will, since I do not hinder, but you may do your own, and not my mind? In which speech, where there hath no manner of
						pre-contract past, I see not, I confesse, what is reprehensible. </p>
					<p> Injury can be done against no man] <hi rend="italic">The word injustice relates to some Law: Injury to some Person, as well as some Law. For what's unjust, is unjust
							to all; but there may an injury be done, and yet not against me, nor thee, but some other; and sometimes against no private Person, but the Magistrate only; sometimes
							also neither against the Magistrate, nor any private man, but onely against God; for through Contract, and conveighance of Right, we say, that an injury is done
							against this, or that man. Hence it is (which we see in all kind of Government) that what private men contract between themselves by word, or writing, is releast
							againe at the will of the Obliger. But those mischiefes which are done against the Lawes of the Land, as theft, homicide, and the like, are punisht not as he wills,
							to whom the hurt is done, but according to the will of the Magistrate; that is, the constituted Lawes.</hi></p>
					<p> V. These words <hi rend="italic">just</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi>, as also <hi rend="italic">justice</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">injustice</hi>, are
						equivocall; for they signifie one thing when they are attributed to Persons, another when to actions: When they are attributed to Actions, <hi rend="italic">Just</hi>
						signifies as much as what's done with Right, and <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi>, as what's done with injury: he who hath done some <hi rend="italic">just</hi> thing is
						not therefore said to be a<hi rend="italic"> just</hi> Person, but <hi rend="italic">guiltlesse</hi>, and he that hath done some <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi> thing, we
						doe not therefore say he is an <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi>, but guilty <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0095" n="40"/>man. But when the words are applyed to Persons; <hi rend="italic">to be just</hi>, signifies as
						much as to be delighted in just dealing, to study how to doe righteousnesse, or to indeavour in all things to doe that which is just; and <hi rend="italic">to be
						unjust</hi>, is to neglect righteous dealing, or to think it is to be measured not according to my contract, but some present benefit; so as the <hi rend="italic"
							>justice</hi> or <hi rend="italic">injustice</hi> of the mind, the intention, or the man, is one thing; that of an action, or omission, another; and innumerable
						actions of a <hi rend="italic">just</hi> man may be <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi>, and of an <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi> man, <hi rend="italic">just</hi>: But that
						man is to be accounted <hi rend="italic">just</hi>, who doth just things because the Law commands it, unjust things only by reason of his infirmity; and he is properly
						said to be <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi> who doth righteousness for fear of the punishment annext unto the Law, and unrighteousnesse by reason of the iniquity of his
						mind. </p>
					<p> VI. The justice of actions is commonly distinguisht into two kinds; <hi rend="italic">Commutative</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Distributive</hi>, the former whereof
						they say consists in Arithmeticall, the latter in Geometricall proportion: and that is conversant in exchanging, in buying, selling, borrowing, lending, location, and
						conduction, and other acts whatsoever belonging to Contracters, where, if there be an equall return made, hence they say springs a <hi rend="italic">commutative
						justice</hi>: But this is busied about the dignity, and merits of men; so as if there be rendred to every man <foreign lang="gre">
							<hi rend="italic">&kgr;&agr;&tgr;&#x1F70; &tgr;&eeacgr;&ngr; &#x1F00;&#x03BE;&iacgr;&agr;&ngr; </hi>
						</foreign> more to him who is more worthy, and lesse to him that deserves lesse, and that proportionably, hence they say ariseth <hi rend="italic">distributive
							justice</hi>: I <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0096" n="41"/>acknowledge here some certaine distinction of equality; to wit, that one is an equality simply so called, as when two things of equall value are
						compar'd together, as a pound of silver with twelve ounces of the same silver; the other is an equality, <foreign lang="lat">
							<hi rend="italic">secundum quod</hi>
						</foreign>, as when a 1000 pound is to be divided to an hundred men, 600 pounds are given to 60 men, and 400 to 40 where there is no equality between 600 and 400. But
						when it happens, that there is the same inequality in the number of them to whom it is distributed, every one of them shall take an equall part, whence it is called an
						equall distribution: But such like equality is the same thing with Geometricall proportion. But what is all this to Justice? for neither, if I sell my goods for as much
						as I can get for them, doe I injure the buyer, who sought, and desir'd them of me? neither if I divide more of what is mine to him who deserves lesse, so long as I give
						the other what I have agreed for, do I wrong to either? which truth our Saviour himself, being God, testifies in the Gospell. This therefore is no distinction of
						Justice, but of equality; yet perhaps it cannot be deny'd, but that Justice is a certain equality, as consisting in this onely; that since we are all equall by nature,
						one should not arrogate more <hi rend="italic">Right</hi> to himselfe, then he grants to another, unlesse he have fairly gotten it by Compact. And let this suffice to
						be spoken against this distinction of <hi rend="italic">Justice</hi>, although now almost generally receiv'd by all, lest any man should conceive an <hi rend="italic"
							>injury</hi> to be somewhat else, then the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0097" n="42"/>breach of Faith, or Contract, as hath been defin'd above. </p>
					<p> VII. It is an old saying,<foreign lang="lat">
							<hi rend="italic"> Volenti non fit iniuria</hi>
						</foreign> (the willing man receives no injury) yet the truth of it may be deriv'd from our Principles. For grant, that a man be willing that that should be done, which
						he conceives to be an injury. to him; why then that is done by his will, which by Contract was not lawfull to be done; but he being willing that should be done, which
						was not lawfull by <hi rend="italic">Contract,</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Contract it self </hi>(by the 15. 5 Article of the foregoing Chapter) becomes void: The <hi
							rend="italic">Right</hi> therefore of doing it returnes, therefore it is done by <hi rend="italic">Right</hi>; wherefore it is no <hi rend="italic">injury</hi>. </p>
					<p> VIII. The third precept of the <hi rend="italic">Naturall Law?</hi>, is, <hi rend="italic"> That you suffer not him to be the worse for you, who out of the confidence
							he had in you, first did you a good turn; or that you accept not a gift, but with a mind to endeavour, that the giver shall have no just occasion to repent him of his
							gift</hi>. For without this he should act without reason that would conferre a benefit where he sees it would be lost; and by this meanes all beneficence, and trust,
						together with all kind of benevolence would be taken from among men, neither would there be ought of mutuall assistance among them, nor any commencement of gaining
						grace and favour. by reason whereof the state of Warre would necessarily remain, contrary to <hi rend="italic">the fundamentall Law of Nature</hi>: But because the
						breach of this Law is not a breach of trust, or contract, (for we suppose no Contracts to have pass'd among <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0098" n="43"/>them) therefore is it not usually termed an iniury, but
						because <hi rend="italic">good turns</hi> and <hi rend="italic">thankes</hi> have a mutuall eye to each other, it is called INGRATITUDE. </p>
					<p> IX.The fourth precept of Nature, is, <hi rend="italic"> That every man render himself usefull unto others</hi>: which, that we may rightly understand, we must
						remember that there is in men, a diversity of dispositions to enter into society, arising from the diversity of their affections, not unlike that which is found in
						stones, brought together in the Building, by reason of the diversity of their matter, and figure. For as a stone, which in regard of its sharp and angular form takes up
						more room from other stones then it fils up it selfe, neither because of the hardnesse of its matter cannot well be prest together, or easily cut, and would hinder the
						building from being fitly compacted, is cast away, <hi rend="italic">as not fit for use</hi>: so a man, who for the harshness of his disposition in retaining
						superfluities for himself, and detaining of necessaries from others, and being incorrigible, by reason of the stubbornnesse of his affections, is commonly said to <hi
							rend="italic">be uselesse</hi>, and troublesome unto others. Now, because each one not by <hi rend="italic">Right </hi>onely, but even by <hi rend="italic">naturall
							necessity</hi> is suppos'd, with all his main might, to intend the procurement of those things which are necessary to his own preservation; if any man will contend on
						the other side for superfluities, by his default there will arise a Warre, because that on him alone there lay no necessity of contending, he therefore acts against the
						<hi rend="italic">fundamentall Law of Nature</hi>: <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0099" n="44"/>Whence it followes (which wee were to shew) that it is a precept of nature; That every man accommodate himselfe to
						others. But he who breaks this Law may be called uselesse, and troublesome. Yet <hi rend="italic">Cicero </hi>opposeth <hi rend="italic">inhumanity </hi>to this <hi
							rend="italic">usefulnesse</hi>, as having regard to this very Law. </p>
					<p> X. The fift precept of the Law of nature is: <hi rend="italic">That we must forgive him who repents, and asketh pardon for what is past; having first taken caution
							for the time to come</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">pardon</hi> of what is past, or the remission of an offence, is nothing else but the granting of <hi rend="italic"
							>peace</hi> to him that asketh it, after he hath <hi rend="italic">warr'd</hi> against us, &amp; now is become penitent. But <hi rend="italic">Peace granted</hi>
						to him that repents not, that is, to him that retains an hostile mind, or that gives not caution for the future; that is, seeks not <hi rend="italic">peace</hi>, but
						oportunity, is not properly <hi rend="italic">peace </hi>but <hi rend="italic">feare</hi>, and therefore is not commanded by nature. Now to him that will not pardon the
						penitent, and that gives future caution, peace it selfe it seems is not pleasing; which is contrary to the <hi rend="italic">naturall Law.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> XI. The sixth precept of the naturall Law is, That in <hi rend="italic">revenge</hi> and <hi rend="italic">punishments we must have our eye not at the evill past, but
							the future good</hi>. That is: It is not lawfull to inflict punishment for any other end, but that the offender may be corrected, or that others warned by his
						punishment may become better. But this is confirmed chiefly from hence, that each man is bound by the law of nature to forgive one another, provided he give <hi
							rend="italic">caution for the future</hi>, as hath been shewed in the foregoing <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0100" n="45"/>Article. Furthermore, because revenge, if the time past be onely considered, is
						nothing else but a certain triumph, and glory of minde, which points at no end, (for it contemplates onely what is past; but the end is a thing to come) but that which
						is directed to no end is vain; That revenge therefore which regards not the <hi rend="italic">future</hi>, proceeds from vaine glory, and therefore without reason. But
						to hurt another without reason introduces a warre, and is contrary to the <hi rend="italic">fundamentall Law of Nature</hi>; It is therefore a precept of the Law of
						nature, that in revenge wee look not backwards but forward. Now the breach of this Law, is commonly called <hi rend="italic">CRUELTY</hi>. </p>
					<p> XII. But because all signes of hatred, and contempt provoke most of all to brawling and fighting, insomuch as most men would rather lose their lives, (that I say not
						their Peace) then suffer reproach; it followes in the seventh place, That it is prescribed by the Law of nature, that no man either by deeds, or words, <hi
							rend="italic">countenance, or laughter, doe declare himselfe to hate, or scorne another</hi>. The breach of which Law is called Reproach. But although nothing be more
						frequent then the scoffes and jeers of the powerfull against the weak, and namely of Judges against guilty persons, which neither relate to the offence of the guilty,
						nor the duty of the Judges, yet these kind of men do act against <hi rend="italic">the Law of nature</hi>, and are to be esteemed for contumelious. </p>
					<p> XIII. The question whether of two men be the more worthy, belongs not to the naturall, but civill state; for it hath <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0101" n="46"/>been shewed before, Chap. I. Art. 3. that all men
						by nature are equall, and therefore the inequality which now is, suppose from riches, power, nobility of kindred, is come from the <hi rend="italic">civill Law</hi>. I
						know that <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi> in his first book of Politiques affirmes as a foundation of the whole politicall science, that some men by nature are made
						worthy to command, others onely to serve; as if Lord and Master were distinguished not by consent of men, but by an aptnesse, that is, a certain kind of naturall
						knowledge, or ignorance; which foundation is not onely against reason (as but now hath been shewed) but also against experience: for neither almost is any man so dull
						of understanding as not to judge it better to be ruled by himselfe, then to yeeld himselfe to the government of another; neither if the wiser and stronger doe contest,
						have these ever, or often the upper hand of those. Whether therefore men be equall by nature, the equality is to be acknowledged, or whether unequall, because they are
						like to contest for dominion, its necessary <hi rend="italic">for the obtaining of Peace, that they be esteemed as equall</hi>; and therefore it is in the eight place a
						precept of the Law of nature, <hi rend="italic">That every man be accounted by nature equall to another</hi>, the contrary to which Law is <hi rend="italic">PRIDE</hi>. </p>
					<p> XIV. As it was necessary to the conservation of each man, that he should part with some of his <hi rend="italic">Rights</hi>, so it is no lesse necessary to the same
						conservation, that he retain some others, to wit the <hi rend="italic">Right</hi> of bodily protection, of free enjoyment of ayre, water, and all necessaries for life.
						Since therefore many <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0102" n="47"/>common <hi rend="italic">Rights</hi> are retained by those who enter into a <hi rend="italic">peaceable state</hi>, and that many peculiar ones are
						also acquired, hence ariseth this ninth dictate of the <hi rend="italic">naturall Law</hi>, to wit, <hi rend="italic">That what Rights soever any man challenges to
							himselfe, he also grant the same as due to all the rest</hi>: otherwise he frustrates the equality acknowledged in the former Article. For what is it else to
						acknowledge an equality of persons in the making up of society, but to attribute equall Right and Power to those whom no reason would else engage to enter into society?
						But to ascribe <hi rend="italic">equall things</hi> to <hi rend="italic">equalls</hi>, is the same with giving things <hi rend="italic">proportionall to
						proportionals</hi>. The observation of this Law is called <hi rend="italic">MEEKNES</hi>, the violation <foreign lang="gre">
							<hi rend="italic">&pgr;&lgr;&egr;&ogr;&ngr;&egr;&#x03BE;&#x03AF;&agr;</hi>
						</foreign>, the breakers by the Latines are styled <foreign lang="lat">
							<hi rend="italic">Immodici &amp; immodesti</hi>
						</foreign>. </p>
					<p> XV. In the tenth place it is commanded by the <hi rend="italic">Law of nature, That every man in dividing Right to others, shew himselfe equall to either party</hi>.
						By the foregoing Law we are forbidden to assume more Right by nature to our selves, then we grant to others. We may take lesse if we will, for that sometimes is an
						argument of <hi rend="italic">modesty</hi>. But if at any time matter of Right be to be divided by us unto others, we are forbidden by this Law to favour one more or
						lesse then another. For he that by favouring one before another, observes not this naturall equality, <hi rend="italic">reproaches </hi>him whom he thus undervalues:
						but it is declared above, that a <hi rend="italic">reproach </hi>is against the <hi rend="italic">Lawes of Nature</hi>. The observance of this Precept is called <hi
							rend="italic">EQUITY</hi>; the breach, <hi rend="italic">Respect of Persons</hi>. The Greeks in one word term it <foreign lang="gre">
							<hi rend="italic">&pgr;&rgr;&ogr;&sgr;&#x03C9;&pgr;&ogr;&lgr;&#x03B7;&#x03C8;&#x03AF;&agr;</hi>
							</foreign>. <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0103" n="48"/></p>
					<p> XVI. From the foregoing Law is collected this eleventh, <hi rend="italic">Those things which cannot be divided, must be used in common, (if they can) and (that the
							quantity of the matter permit) every man as much as he lists, but if the quantity permit not, then with limitation, and proPortionally to the number of the
						users</hi>: for otherwise that equality can by no means be observed, which we have shewed in the forgoing Article to be commanded by the Law of Nature. </p>
					<p> XVII. Also what cannot be divided, nor had in common, it is provided by the <hi rend="italic">Law of nature</hi> (which may be the twelfth Precept) <hi rend="italic"
							>that the use of that thing be either by turns, or adjudged to one onely by lot, and that in the using it by turns, it be also decided by lot who shall have the first
							use of it</hi>; For here also regard is to be had unto equality: but no other can be found, but that of lot. </p>
					<p> XVIII. But all lot is twofold; <hi rend="italic">arbitrary</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">naturall</hi>; Arbitrary is that which is cast by the consent of the Contenders,
						and it consists in meer <hi rend="italic">chance </hi>(as they say) or <hi rend="italic">fortune</hi>. Naturall is <hi rend="italic">primogeniture </hi>(in Greek
							<foreign lang="gre">
							<hi rend="italic">&kgr;&lgr;&#x03B7;&rgr;&ogr;&ngr;&ogr;&mgr;&#x03AF;&agr;</hi>
						</foreign>, as it were given by lot) or <hi rend="italic">first possession</hi>. Therefore the things which can neither be divided, nor had in common, must be granted
						to the first possessour, as also those things which belonged to the Father are due to the Sonne, unlesse the Father himselfe have formerly conveighed away that <hi
							rend="italic">Right </hi>to some other. Let this therefore stand for the thirteenth <hi rend="italic">Law of Nature</hi>. </p>
					<p> XIX. The 14 Precept of the Law of nature is; <hi rend="italic">That safety must be assured to the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0104" n="49"/>Mediators for Peace</hi>. For the reason which commands the end,
						commands also the means necessary to the end. But the first dictate of Reason is <hi rend="italic">Peace</hi>. All the rest are means to obtain it, and without which
							<hi rend="italic">Peace </hi>cannot be had. But neither can <hi rend="italic">Peace </hi>be had without mediation, nor mediation without safety; it is therefore a
						dictate of Reason, that is, a <hi rend="italic">Law of nature</hi>, That we must give all security to the Mediators for <hi rend="italic">Peace</hi>. </p>
					<p> XX. Furthermore, because, although men should agree to make all these, and whatsoever other <hi rend="italic">Lawes of Nature</hi>, and should endeavour to keep them,
						yet doubts, and controversies would daily arise concerning the application of them unto their actions, to wit, whether <hi rend="italic">what was done</hi>, were
						against the <hi rend="italic">Law</hi>, or not, (which we call, the question of Right) whence will follow a fight between Parties, either sides supposing themselves
						wronged; it is therefore necessary to the preservation of <hi rend="italic">Peace </hi>(because in this case no other fit remedy can possibly be thought on) that both
						the disagreeing Parties refer the matter unto some third, and oblige themselves by <hi rend="italic">mutuall compacts</hi> to stand to his judgement in deciding the
						controversie. And he to whom they thus refer themselves is called an Arbiter. It is therefore the 15. Precept of the <hi rend="italic">naturall Law, That both parties
							disputing concerning the matter of right submit themselves unto the opinion and judgement of some third</hi>. </p>
					<p> XXI. But from this ground, that an <hi rend="italic">Arbiter </hi>or <hi rend="italic">Judge </hi>is chosen by the differing Parties to determine the controversie, we
						gather, that <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0105" n="50"/>the <hi rend="italic">Arbiter </hi>must not be one of the Parties: for every man is presumed to seek what is <hi rend="italic">good for himselfe</hi>
						naturally, and what is <hi rend="italic">just</hi>, onely for <hi rend="italic">Peaces </hi>sake, and accidentally. and therefore cannot observe that same equality
						commanded by, the <hi rend="italic">Law of nature</hi> so exactly as a third man would do: It is therefore in the sixteenth place contained in the <hi rend="italic">Law
							of nature, That no man must be Judge or Arbiter in his own cause</hi>. </p>
					<p> XXII. From the same ground followes in the seventeenth place, <hi rend="italic">That no man must be Judge who propounds unto himself any hope of profit, or glory,
							from the victory of either part</hi>: for the like reason swayes here, as in the foregoing Law. </p>
					<p> XXIII. But when there is some controversie of the fact it selfe, to wit, whether that bee done or not, which is said to bee done, <hi rend="italic">the naturall Law
							wills</hi>, that the Arbiter trust both Parties alike, that is, (because they affirm contradictories) that hee believe neither: He must therefore give credit to a
						third, or a third and fourth, or more, that he may be able to give judgement of the fact, as often as by other signes he cannot come to the knowledge of it. The 18. <hi
							rend="italic">Law of nature</hi> therefore injoynes <hi rend="italic">Arbiters</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Iudges </hi>of fact, <hi rend="italic">That where firm and
							certain signes of the fact appear not, there they rule their sentence by such witnesses, as seem to be indifferent to both Parts.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> XXIV. From the above declared definition of an <hi rend="italic">Arbiter </hi>may be furthermore understood, <hi rend="italic">That no contract or promise must Passe
						between him and the parties whose Iudge he is appointed, by vertue whereof he may be <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0106" n="51"/>engaged to speak in favour of either part, nay, or be oblig'd to judge according
							to equity, or to pronounce such sentence as he shall truly judge to be equall</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">Judge </hi>is indeed bound to give such sentence as he shall
						judge to be equall by the <hi rend="italic">Law of Nature</hi> re-counted in the 15. Article. To the obligation of which Law nothing can be added by way of Compact.
						Such compact therefore would be in vain. Besides, if giving wrong judgement, he should contend for the equity of it, except such Compact be of no force, the
						Controversie would remain after Judgement given, which is contrary to the <hi rend="italic">constitution of an Arbiter</hi>, who is so chosen, as both parties have
						oblig'd themselves to stand to the judgement which he should pronounce. The <hi rend="italic">Law of Nature</hi> therefore commands the <hi rend="italic">Judge </hi>to
						be dis-engaged, which is its 19 precept. </p>
					<p> XXV. Farthermore, forasmuch as the <hi rend="italic">Lawes of Nature</hi> are nought else but the dictates of Reason, so as, unlesse a man endeavour to preserve the
						faculty of right reasoning, he cannot observe the Lawes of Nature, it is manifest, that he, who knowingly, or willingly, doth ought, whereby the rationall faculty may
						be destroyed, or weakned, he knowingly, and willingly, breaks the Law of nature: For there is no difference between a man who performes not his Duty, and him who does
						such things willingly, as make it impossible for him to doe it. But they destroy and weaken the reasoning faculty, who doe that which disturbs the mind from its
						naturall state; that which most manifestly happens to <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0107" n="52"/><hi rend="italic">Drunkards and Gluttons</hi>; we therefore sin in the 20 place against the Law of Nature by <hi
							rend="italic">Drunkennesse</hi>. </p>
					<p> XXVI. Perhaps some man, who sees all these <hi rend="italic">precepts of Nature</hi> deriv'd by a certain artifice from the single dictate of Reason advising us to
						look to the preservation, and safegard of our selves, will say, That the deduction of these Lawes is so hard, that it is not to be expected they will be vulgarly known,
						and therefore neither will they prove obliging: for Lawes, if they be not known, oblige not, nay, indeed are not Lawes. To this I answer, it's true, That <hi
							rend="italic">hope, fear, anger, ambition, covetousnesse, vain glory</hi>, and other perturbations of mind, doe hinder a man so, as he cannot attaine to the knowledge
						of these Lawes, whilst those passions prevail in him: But there is no man who is not sometimes in a quiet mind; At that time therefore there is nothing easier for him
						to know, though he be never so rude and unlearn'd, then this only Rule, That when he doubts, whether what he is now doing to another, may be done by the <hi
							rend="italic">Law of Nature</hi>, or not, he conceive himselfe to be in that others stead. Here instantly those perturbations which perswaded him to the fact, being
						now cast into the other scale, disswade him as much: And this Rule is not onely easie, but is Anciently celebrated in these words, <hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="lat"
								>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris: </foreign>Do not that to others, you would not have done to your self.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> XXVII. But because most men, by reason of their perverse desire of present <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0108" n="53"/>profit, are very unapt to observe these Lawes, although acknowledg'd by them, if perhaps
						some others more humble then the rest should exercise that equity and usefulnesse which Reason dictates, those not practising the same, surely they would not follow
						Reason in so doing; nor would they hereby procure themselves peace, but a more certain quick destruction, and the keepers of the Law become a meer prey to the breakers
						of it. It is not therefore to be imagin'd, that by Nature, (that is, by Reason) men are oblig'd to the exercise of all these Lawes in that state of men wherein they are
						not practis'd by others. We are oblig'd yet in the interim to a readinesse of mind to observe them whensoever their observation shall seeme to conduce to the end for
						which they were ordain'd. We must therefore conclude, that the Law of Nature doth alwayes, and every where oblige in the <hi rend="italic">internall Court</hi>, or that
						of <hi rend="italic">Conscience</hi>, but not alwayes in the <hi rend="italic">externall Court</hi>, but then onely when it may be done with safety. </p>
					<p> The exercise of all these Lawes] <hi rend="italic">Nay among these Lawes some things there are, the omission whereof (provided it be done for Peace, or
							Self-preservation) seemes rather to be the fulfilling, then breach of the Naturall Law; for he that doth all things against those that doe all things, and plunders
							plunderers, doth equity; but on the other side, to doe that which in Peace is an handsome action, and becomming an honest man, is dejectednesse, and Poornesse of
							spirit, and a betraying of ones self in the time of War, But there are certain naturall Lawes, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0109" n="54"/>whose exercise ceaseth not even in the time of War it self; for I
							cannot understand what drunkennesse, or cruelty (that is, Revenge which respects not the future good) can advance toward Peace, or the preservation of any man.
							Briefly, in the state of nature, what's just, and unjust, is not to be esteem'd by the Actions, but by the Counsell, and Conscience of the Actor. That which is done
							out of necessity, out of endeavour for Peace, for the preservation of our selves, is done with Right; otherwise every damage done to a man would be a breach of the
							naturall Law, and an injury against God.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> XXVIII. But the Lawes which oblige Conscience, may be broken by an act, not onely contrary to them, but also agreeable with them, if so be that he who does it be of
						another opinion: for though the act it self be answerable to the Lawes, yet his Conscience is against them. </p>
					<p> XXIX. <hi rend="italic">The Lawes of Nature are immutable, and eternall</hi>; What they forbid, can never be lawfull; what they command, can never be unlawfull: For
							<hi rend="italic">pride, ingratitude, breach of Contracts (or injury), inhumanity, contumely</hi>, will never be lawfull; nor the contrary vertues to these ever
						unlawfull, as we take them for dispositions of the mind, that is, as they are considered in the <hi rend="italic">Court of Conscience</hi>, where onely they oblige, and
						are Lawes. Yet actions may be so diversified by circumstances, and the Civill Law, that what's done with equity at one time, is guilty of iniquity at another; and what
						suits with reason at one time, is contrary to it another. Yet Reason is still the same, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0110" n="55"/>and changeth not her end, which is <hi rend="italic">Peace</hi>, and <hi
							rend="italic">Defence</hi>; nor of the minde which the meanes to attaine them, to wit, those vertues we have declar'd above, and which cannot be abrogated by any
						Custome, or Law whatsoever. </p>
					<p> XXX. It's evident by what hath hitherto been said, how easily the <hi rend="italic">Lawes of Nature</hi> are to be observ'd, because they require the endeavour onely,
						(but that must be true and constant) which who so shall performe, we may rightly call him JUST. For he who tends to this with his whole might, namely, that his actions
						be squar'd according to the <hi rend="italic">precepts of Nature</hi>, he shewes clearly that he hath a minde to fulfill all those Lawes, which is all we are oblig'd to
						by rationall nature. Now he that hath done all he is oblig'd to, is a <hi rend="italic">Just Man</hi>. </p>
					<p> XXXI. All Writers doe agree that the <hi rend="italic">Naturall Law</hi> is the same with the <hi rend="italic">Morall</hi>. Let us see wherefore this is true. We
						must know therefore, that <hi rend="italic">Good </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Evill </hi>are names given to things to signifie the inclination, or aversion of them by
						whom they were given. But the inclinations of men are diverse, according to their diverse Constitutions, Customes, Opinions; as we may see in those things we apprehend
						by sense, as by tasting, touching, smelling; but much more in those which pertain to the common actions of life, where what this man <hi rend="italic">commends</hi>,
						(that is to say, calls <hi rend="italic">Good</hi>) the other <hi rend="italic">undervalues</hi>, as being <hi rend="italic">Evil</hi>; Nay, very often the same man at
						diverse times, <hi rend="italic">praises</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">dispraises </hi>the same thing. Whilst thus they doe, necessary it is there <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0111" n="56"/>should be discord, and
						strife: They are therefore so long in the state of War, as by reason of the diversity of the present appetites, they mete Good and Evill by diverse measures. All men
						easily acknowledge this state, as long as they are in it, to be evill, and by consequence that <hi rend="italic">Peace </hi>is good. They therefore who could not agree
						concerning a present, doe agree concerning a future Good, which indeed is a work of Reason; for <hi rend="italic">things present</hi> are obvious to the sense, things
							<hi rend="italic">to come</hi> to our Reason only. Reason declaring Peace to be good, it followes by the same reason, that all the necessary means to Peace be good
						also, and therefore, that <hi rend="italic">Modesty, Equity, Trust, Humanity, Mercy</hi> (which we have demonstrated to be necessary to Peace) are <hi rend="italic"
							>good Manners</hi>, or habits, (that is) Vertues. The <hi rend="italic">Law </hi>therefore, in the means to Peace, commands also <hi rend="italic">Good Manners</hi>,
						or the practise of <hi rend="italic">Vertue</hi>: And therefore it is call'd <hi rend="italic">Morall</hi>. </p>
					<p> XXXII. But because men cannot put off this same irrationall appetite, whereby they greedily prefer the present good (to which, by strict consequence, many unfore-seen
						evills doe adhere) before the future, it happens, that though all men doe agree in the commendation of the foresaid vertues, yet they disagree still concerning their
						Nature, to wit, in what each of them doth consist; for as oft as anothers good action displeaseth any man, that action hath the name given of some neighbouring vice;
						likewise the bad actions, which please them, are ever entituled to some Vertue; whence it comes to passe that the same Action is prais'd by these, and call'd Vertue,
						and <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0112" n="57"/>dispraised by those, and termed vice. Neither is there as yet any remedy found by Philosophers for this matter; for since they could not observe the goodnesse of
						actions to consist in this, that it was in order to Peace, and the evill in this, that it related to discord, they built a <hi rend="italic">morall Philosophy</hi>
						wholly estranged from the <hi rend="italic">morall Law</hi>, and unconstant to it self; for they would have the nature of <hi rend="italic">vertues </hi>seated in a
						certain kind of <hi rend="italic">mediocrity betweene two extremes</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">vices </hi>in the <hi rend="italic">extremes themselves</hi>; which
						is apparently false: For to dare is commended, and under the name of <hi rend="italic">fortitude </hi>is taken for a vertue, although it be an extreme, if the cause be
						approved. Also the quantity of a thing given, whether it be great, or little, or between both, makes not <hi rend="italic">liberality</hi>, but the cause of giving it.
						Neither is it <hi rend="italic">injustice</hi>, if I give any man more, of what is mine own, then I owe him. The <hi rend="italic">Lawes of Nature</hi> therefore are
						the summe of <hi rend="italic">Morall</hi> Philosophy, whereof I have onely delivered such precepts in this place, as appertain to the preservation of our selves
						against those dangers which arise from discord. But there are other precepts of <hi rend="italic">rationall </hi>nature, from whence spring other vertues: for <hi
							rend="italic">temperance </hi>also is a precept of Reason, because intemperance tends to sicknesse, and death. And so fortitude too, (that is) that same faculty of
						resisting stoutly in present dangers, (and which are more hardly declined then overcome) because it is a means tending to the preservation of him that resists. </p>
					<p> XXXIII. But those which we call the <hi rend="italic">Lawes of nature</hi> (since they are nothing else <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0113" n="58"/>but certain conclusions understood by Reason, of things to be
						done, and omitted; but a Law to speak properly and accurately, is the speech of him who by Right commands somewhat to others to be done, or omitted) are not (in
						propriety of speech) Lawes, as they proceed from nature; yet as they are delivered by God in holy Scriptures, (as we shall see in the Chapter following) they are most
						properly called by the name of Lawes: for the <hi rend="italic">sacred Scripture</hi> is the speech of God commanding over all things by greatest Right.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="chapter" n="4" id="d13">
					<head>Chapter IV<lb/>
						<hi rend="italic">That the Law of Nature is a Divine Law</hi></head>

					<p> I. The same <hi rend="italic">Law </hi>which is <hi rend="italic">Naturall</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Morall</hi>, is also wont to be called <hi rend="italic"
						>Divine</hi>, nor undeservedly, as well because <hi rend="italic">Reason</hi>, which is the <hi rend="italic">law of Nature</hi>, is given by God to every man for the
						rule of his actions; as because the precepts of living which are thence derived, are the same with those which have been delivered from the divine Majesty, for the <hi
							rend="italic">LAWES </hi>of his <hi rend="italic">heavenly Kingdome,</hi> by our Lord <hi rend="italic">Iesus Christ</hi>, and his holy <hi rend="italic">Prophets
						</hi>and <hi rend="italic">Apostles</hi>. What therefore by reasoning we have understood above concerning the law of <hi rend="italic">nature</hi>, we will endeavour to
						confirme the same in this Chapter by holy writ. <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0114" n="59"/></p>
					<p> II. But first we will shew those places in which it is declared, that the Divine Law is seated in right reason. <hi rend="italic">Psalm</hi> 37, 30, 31. <hi
							rend="italic">The mouth of the righteous will be exercised in wisdome, and his tongue will be talking of Iudgement: The law of God is in his heart</hi>. Jerem. 31.
						33. <hi rend="italic">I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts</hi>. Psal. 19. 7. <hi rend="italic">The law of the Lord is an undefiled
							law, converting the soule</hi>. ver. 8. <hi rend="italic">The Commandement of the Lord is Pure, and giveth light unto the eyes</hi>. Deuteron. 30. 11. <hi
							rend="italic">This Commandement which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off, &amp;c</hi>. vers. 14. <hi rend="italic">But the
							word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thine heart; that thou maist doe it</hi>. Psal. 119. 34. <hi rend="italic">Give me understanding, and I shall keep
							thy law</hi>. vers. 105. <hi rend="italic">Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my paths</hi>. Proverbs 9. 10. <hi rend="italic">The knowledge of the
							holy is understanding</hi>. John 1. 1. <hi rend="italic">Christ </hi>the Law-giver himselfe is called <hi rend="italic">the word</hi>. vers. 9. The same <hi
							rend="italic">Christ</hi> is called t<hi rend="italic">he true light that ligiteth every man that cometh in the world.</hi> All which are descriptions of right <hi
							rend="italic">reason</hi>, whose dictates, we have shewed before, are the <hi rend="italic">lawes of nature</hi>. </p>
					<p> III. But that which wee set downe for the <hi rend="italic">fundamentall law of nature</hi>, namely, that <hi rend="italic">Peace was to be sought for</hi>, is also
						the summe of the <hi rend="italic">divine law</hi>, will be manifest by these places. Rom. 3. 17. <hi rend="italic">Righteousnesse</hi>, (which is the summe of the law)
						is called the <hi rend="italic">way of Peace</hi> Psal. 85. 10. <hi rend="italic">Righteousnesse and Peace have kissed each other</hi>. Matth. 5. 9. <hi rend="italic"
							>Blessed are the Peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of God</hi>. And after Saint <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0115" n="60"/><hi rend="italic">Paul </hi>in his 6. Chapter to the Hebrewes, and
						the last verse had called <hi rend="italic">Christ </hi>(the Legislator of that law we treat of) an <hi rend="italic">High-Priest for ever after the order of</hi>
						Melchizedeck; he addes in the following Chapter, the first verse, <hi rend="italic">This </hi>Melchizedeck <hi rend="italic">was King of</hi> Salem, <hi rend="italic"
							>Priest of the most high God,</hi> &amp;c. vers. 2. <hi rend="italic">First being by interpretation King of Righteousnesse, and after that also King of
							</hi>Salem<hi rend="italic">, which is, King of peace</hi>. Whence it is cleare, that <hi rend="italic">Christ the King</hi> in his Kingdome placeth <hi rend="italic"
							>Righteousnesse and Peace together</hi>. Psal. 34. <hi rend="italic">Eschue evill and doe good, seek Peace and ensue it</hi>. Isaiah 9. 6, 7. <hi rend="italic">Unto
							us a child is born, unto us a Sonne is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderfull, Counsellour, the mighty God, the
							everlasting Father, the Prince of peace</hi>. Isaiah 52. 7. <hi rend="italic">How beautifull upon the mountaines are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that
							publisheth Peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation, that saith unto </hi>Sion, <hi rend="italic">thy God reigneth!</hi> 3 Luke 2. 14. In
						the Nativity of <hi rend="italic">Christ</hi>, the voice of them that praised God saying, <hi rend="italic">Glory be to God on high, and in earth Peace, good will
							towards men</hi>. And <hi rend="italic">Isaiah </hi>53. 5. The Gospell is called the <hi rend="italic">chastisement of our Peace</hi>. Isay 59. 8. <hi rend="italic"
							>Righteousnesse </hi>is called the way of Peace. <hi rend="italic">The way of Peace they know not, and there is no judgement in their goings</hi>. Micah 5. 4, 5.
						speaking of the <hi rend="italic">Messias</hi>, he saith thus, <hi rend="italic">hee shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the Majesty of the name of the
						Lord his God, and they shall abide, for now shall he be great unto the end of the earth; And this man shall be your Peace,</hi> &amp;c. <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0116"
							n="61"/>Prov. 3. 1, 2. <hi
							rend="italic">My sonne forget not my law, but let thine heart keep my Commandements, for length of dayes, and long life, and Peace, shall they adde to thee</hi>. </p>
					<p> IV. What appertains to the first law of <hi rend="italic">abolishing the community of all things</hi>, or concerning the introduction of <hi rend="italic">meum
							&amp; tuum</hi>, We perceive in the first place how great an adversary this same Community is to Peace, by those words of <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>to <hi
							rend="italic">Lot</hi>, Gen. 13. 8. <hi rend="italic">Let there be no strife I Pray thee, between thee and me, and between thy heard-men, and my heard-men, for we be
							brethren. Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thy selfe I Pray thee from me</hi>. And all those places of Scripture by which we are forbidden to trespasse
						upon our neighbours, as, <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal</hi>, &amp;c. doe confirm the law of
						distinction between <hi rend="italic">Mine</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Thine</hi>. for they suppose <hi rend="italic">the right of all men to all things to be taken
							away</hi>. </p>
					<p> V. The same precepts establish the second law of nature of keeping trust: for what doth, Thou shalt not invade anothers right, import, but this? <hi rend="italic"
							>Thou shalt not take possession of that, which by thy contract ceaseth to be thine</hi>; but expressely set down, <hi rend="italic">Psal</hi>. 15. <hi rend="italic"
							>vers</hi>. 1. To him that asked, <hi rend="italic">Lord who shall dwell in thy Tabernacle</hi>? It is answered, vers. 3, 4: <hi rend="italic">He that sweareth unto
							his neighbour, and disappointeth him not</hi>; and Prov. 6. 1. <hi rend="italic">My sonne if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou have stricken thy hand with a
							stranger, Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> VI. The third <hi rend="italic">Law </hi>concerning gratitude is proved by these places, Deut. 25. 4. <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0117" n="62"/><hi rend="italic">Thou shalt not muzzle the Oxe when he treadeth
							out the corn</hi>; which Saint <hi rend="italic">Paul </hi>I. <hi rend="italic">Cor</hi>. 9. 9. interprets to be spoken of men, not Oxen onely. Prov. 17. 13. <hi
							rend="italic">Who so rewardeth evill for good, evill shall not depart from his house</hi>. And <hi rend="italic">Deut</hi>. 20. 10, 11. <hi rend="italic">When thou
							comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim Peace unto it. And it shall be if it make thee answer of Peace, and oPen unto thee, then it shall be that
							all the people that is found therein, shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee</hi>. Proverbs 3. 29. <hi rend="italic">Devise not evill against thy
							neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee</hi>. </p>
					<p> VII. To the fourth Law of <hi rend="italic">accommodating our selves</hi>, these precepts are conformable, <hi rend="italic">Exod</hi>. 23. 4, 5. <hi rend="italic">If
							thou meet thine enemies Oxe, or his Asse going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again; if thou see the Asse of him that hateth thee lying under his
							burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him,</hi> vers. 9. Also, <hi rend="italic">thou shalt not oppresse a stranger</hi>. Prov. 3. 30.
							<hi rend="italic">Strive not with a man without a cause, if he have done thee no harme</hi>. Prov. 15. 18. <hi rend="italic">A wrathfull man stirreth up strife, but
							he that is slow to anger, appeaseth strife</hi>. 18. 24. <hi rend="italic">There is a friend that sticketh closer then a brother</hi>. The same is confirmed, <hi
							rend="italic">Luke </hi>10. By the Parable of the Samaritan, who had compassion on the Jew that was wounded by theeves, and by Christs precept, <hi rend="italic"
							>Matth</hi>. 5. 39. <hi rend="italic">But I say unto you, that ye resist not evill, but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other
						also</hi>, &amp;c. </p>
					<p> VIII. Among infinite other places which prove the fifth law, these are some. <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0118" n="63"/><hi rend="italic">Matth</hi>. 6. 14. <hi rend="italic">If you forgive men their
							trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses</hi>. Math. 18.
						21. <hi rend="italic">Lord how oft shall my Brother sinne against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not till seven times, but till
							seventy times seven times: that is, toties quoties</hi>. </p>
					<p> IX. For the confirmation of the sixth law, all those places are pertinent which command us to shew mercy; such as <hi rend="italic">Mat</hi>. 5. 7. <hi rend="italic"
							>Blessed are the mercifull, for they shall obtain mercy</hi>. Levit. 19. 18. <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy
							people</hi>. But there are, who not onely think this law is not proved by Scripture, but plainly disproved from hence, that there is an eternall punishment reserved
						for the wicked after death, where there is no place either for amendment, or example. Some resolve this objection by answering, That God, whom no law restrains, refers
						all to his glory, but that man must not doe so; as if God sought his glory, (that is to say) pleased himselfe in the death of a sinner. It is more rightly answered,
						that the institution of eternall punishment was before sin, and had regard to this onely, that men might dread to commit sinne for the time to come. </p>
					<p> X. The words of Christ prove this seventh, <hi rend="italic">Matth</hi>. 5. 22. <hi rend="italic">But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without
					a cause, shall be in danger of the judgement, and whosoever shall say unto his Brother</hi> Racha,<hi rend="italic"> shall be in danger of the Counsell, but whosoever<pb
						entity="DSSR_000002537_0119" n="64"/>
							shall say, thou foole, shall be in danger of hell fire</hi>. Prov. 10. 18. <hi rend="italic">Hee that uttereth a slander is a foole</hi>. Prov. 14. 21. <hi
							rend="italic">Hee that despiseth his neighbour, sinneth.</hi> 15. 1. <hi rend="italic">Grievous words stir up anger</hi>. Prov. 22. 10. <hi rend="italic">Cast out the
							scorner, and contention shall goe out, and reproach shall cease</hi>. </p>
					<p> XI. The eighth law of acknowledging equality of nature, that is, of <hi rend="italic">humility</hi>, is established by these places. Mat. 5. 3. <hi rend="italic"
							>Blessed are the Poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven</hi>. Prov. 6. 16, 19. <hi rend="italic">These six things doth the Lord hate, yea seven are an
							abomination unto him: A proud look,</hi> &amp;c. Prov. 16. 5. <hi rend="italic">Every one that is proud is an abomination unto the Lord, though hand joyne in
							hand, he shall not be unpunished.</hi> 11. 2. <hi rend="italic">When pride cometh, then cometh shame, but with the lowly, is wisdome</hi>. Thus <hi rend="italic">Isay
						</hi>40. 3. (where the <hi rend="italic">comming </hi>of the Messias is shewed forth, for preparation towards his Kingdome) <hi rend="italic">The voyce of him that
							cryed in the wildernesse, was this: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make strait in the desart a high way for our God. Every valley shall be exalted, and every
							mountain, and hill, shall be made low;</hi> which doubtlesse is spoken to men, and not to mountains. </p>
					<p> XII. But that same <hi rend="italic">Equity </hi>which we proved in the ninth place to be a <hi rend="italic">Law of Nature</hi>, which commands every man to allow
						the same Rights to others they would be allowed themselves, and which containes in it all the other Lawes besides, is the same which <hi rend="italic">Moses</hi> sets down, <hi rend="italic"
							>Levit</hi>. 19. 18. <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self</hi>; and our Saviour calls it the <hi rend="italic">summe of the morall Law</hi>, <pb
								entity="DSSR_000002537_0120" n="65"/>
						Mat. 22. 36. <hi rend="italic">Master, which is the great Commandement in the Law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with
							all thy soul, and with all thy mind; this is the first and great Commandement, and the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self. On these two
							Commandements hang all the Law and the Prophets</hi>. But to love our neighbor as our selves, is nothing else, but to grant him all we desire to have granted to our
						selves. </p>
					<p> XIII. By the tenth Law <hi rend="italic">respect of Persons</hi> is forbid; as also by these places following, <hi rend="italic">Mat</hi>. 5. 45. <hi rend="italic"
							>That ye may be children of your Father which is in Heaven; for he maketh the sun to rise on the Evill, and on the Good,</hi> &amp;c. Collos. 3. 11. <hi
							rend="italic">There is neither Greek, nor Jew, circumcision, nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, or Scythian, bond, or free, but Christ is all, &amp; in all.</hi> Acts
						10. 34. <hi rend="italic">Of a truth, I perceive, that God is no respecter of Persons</hi>. 2 Chron. 19. 7. <hi rend="italic">There is no iniquity with the Lord our
							God, nor respect of Persons, nor taking of gifts.</hi> Ecclus. 35. 12. <hi rend="italic">The Lord is Judge, and with him is no respect of Persons</hi>. Rom. 2. 11.
							<hi rend="italic">For there is no respect of Persons with God.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> XIV. The eleventh Law, which commands <hi rend="italic">those things to be held in common which cannot be divided</hi>, I know not whether there be any expresse place
						in Scripture for it, or not; but the practise appears every where in the common use of Wels, Wayes, Rivers, sacred things, &amp;c. for else men could not live. </p>
					<p> XV. We said in the twelfth place, that it was a Law of Nature, <hi rend="italic">That where things could neither be divided, nor possess'd in common, they should be
						dispos'd by lot,</hi> which is <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0121" n="66"/>confirmed as by the example of <hi rend="italic">Moses</hi>, who by Gods command, <hi rend="italic">Numb</hi>. 34. divided the severall
						parts of the land of promise unto the Tribes by <hi rend="italic">Lot</hi>: So <hi rend="italic">Acts </hi>I. 24. by the example of the Apostles, who receiv'd <hi
							rend="italic">Matthias</hi>, before <hi rend="italic">Justus</hi>, into their number, by casting <hi rend="italic">Lots</hi>, and saying, T<hi rend="italic">hou Lord,
							who knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,</hi> &amp;c. Prov. 16. 33. <hi rend="italic">The lot is cast into the lappe, but
							the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord.</hi> And which is the thirteenth Law, the Succession was due unto <hi rend="italic">Esau</hi>, as being the First-born of
							<hi rend="italic">Isaac</hi>, if himself had not sold it, (<hi rend="italic">Gen</hi>. 25. 30.) or that the Father had not otherwise appointed. </p>
					<p> XVI. Saint <hi rend="italic">Paul </hi>writing to the <hi rend="italic">Corinthians</hi>, Epist. 1. Chap. 6. reprehends the <hi rend="italic">Corinthians </hi>of that
						City for going to Law one with another before infidell Judges who were their enemies, calling it a fault, that they would not rather take wrong, and suffer themselves
						to be defrauded; for that is against that Law, whereby we are commanded <hi rend="italic">to be helpful to each other</hi>. But if it happen the Controversie be
						concerning things necessary, what is to be done? Therefore the Apostle, <hi rend="italic">Ver</hi>. 5. speaks thus, <hi rend="italic">I speak to your shame. Is it so
							that there is not one wise man among you, no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren</hi>? He therefore, by those words confirmes that Law of Nature
						which we call'd the fifteenth, to wit, Where Controversies cannot be avoided, there by the consent of Parties to appoint some Arbiter, and him some third man; so as
						(which is the 16 Law) neither of the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0122" n="67"/>Parties may be judge in his own Cause. </p>
					<p> XVII. But that the <hi rend="italic">Judge</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Arbiter</hi>, must receive no reward for his Sentence, (which is the 17. Law) appears, <hi
							rend="italic">Exod</hi>. 23. 8. <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt take no gift; for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous</hi>. Ecclus. 20.
						29. <hi rend="italic">Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise</hi>. Whence it followes, that he must not be more oblig'd to one part then the other, which is the
						19. Law, and is also confirm'd, Deut. 1. 17. <hi rend="italic">Ye shall not respect Persons in Judgment, ye shall hear the small as well as the great;</hi> and in all
						those places which are brought against respect of Persons. </p>
					<p> XVIII. That in the judgement of <hi rend="italic">Fact</hi>, <hi rend="italic">witnesses </hi>must be had, (which is the 18. Law) the Scripture not only confirmes,
						but requires more then one, <hi rend="italic">Deut</hi>. 17. 6. <hi rend="italic">At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be
							put to death.</hi> The same is repeated, Deut. 19. 15. </p>
					<p> XIX. Drunkennesse, which we have therefore in the last place numbred among the breaches of the <hi rend="italic">Naturall Law</hi>, because it hinders the use of
						right Reason, is also forbid in sacred Scripture for the same reason. <hi rend="italic">Prov</hi>. 20. 1. <hi rend="italic">Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging,
							whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise</hi>. And Chap. 31. 4, 5. <hi rend="italic">It is not for Kings to drink wine, lest they drink, and forget the Law, and
							pervert the judgement of any of the afflicted</hi>: but that we might know that the malice of this vice consisted not formally in the quantity of the drink, but in
						that it destroyes Judgement and Reason, it followes in the next Verse, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0123" n="68"/><hi rend="italic">Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to those that be
							heavy of heart. Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. Christ</hi> useth the same reason in prohibiting <hi rend="italic"
						>drunkenesse</hi>, Luk. 21. 34. <hi rend="italic">Take heed to your selves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharg'd with surfetting and drunkennesse.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> XX. That we said in the foregoing Chapter, <hi rend="italic">The Law of Nature is eternall</hi>, is also prov'd out of the fifth of S. <hi rend="italic">Matth</hi>.
						18. <hi rend="italic">Verily I say unto you, till Heaven and Earth Passe, one jot, or one tittle, shall in no wise Passe from the Law,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
						>Psal</hi>. 119. v. 160. <hi rend="italic">Every one of thy righteous judgements endureth for ever.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> XXI. We also said, That the <hi rend="italic">Lawes of Nature had regard chiefly unto Conscience</hi>; that is, that he is <hi rend="italic">just</hi>, who by all
						possible endeavour strives to fulfill them. And although a man should order all his actions (so much as belongs to externall obedience) just as the Law commands, but
						not for the Lawes sake, but by reason of some punishment annext unto it, or out of Vain glory, yet he is <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi>. Both these are proved by the
						Holy Scriptures. The first, <hi rend="italic">Esay </hi>55. 7. <hi rend="italic">Let the wicked forsake his way, and unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return
							unto the Lord, and he wil have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> Ezek. 18. 31. <hi rend="italic">Cast away from you all your
							transgressions whereby you have transgressed, &amp; make you a new heart, and a new spirit; for why will you die O house of Israel?</hi> By which, and the like
						places, we may sufficiently understand that God will not punish their deeds whose heart is right. The second <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0124" n="69"/>out of the 29. of Isay 13. <hi rend="italic">The Lord said,
							Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips doe honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, therefore I will proceed,</hi>
						&amp;c. Mat. 5. 20. <hi rend="italic">Except your righteousnesse shall exceed the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the
							Kingdom of Heaven</hi>; and in the following verses our Saviour explains to them how that the commands of God are broken, not by Deeds only, but also by the Will; for
						the Scribes and Pharises did in outward act observe the Law most exactly, but for Glories sake onely; else they would as readily have broken it. There are innumerable
						places of Scripture in which is most manifestly declar'd that God accepts the Will for the Deed, and that as well in good, as in evill actions. </p>
					<p> XXII. That the Law of Nature is <hi rend="italic">easily kept</hi>, Christ himself declares in the 11. Chapter of Saint <hi rend="italic">Matthew </hi>28, 29, 30. <hi
							rend="italic">Come unto me, &amp;c. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, &amp;c. for my yoke is easie, and my burthen light</hi>. </p>
					<p> XXIII. Lastly, the Rule by which I said any man might know whether what he was doing, were contrary to the Law, or not, to wit, what thou wouldst not be done to, doe
						not that to another, is almost in the self same words delivered by our Saviour, <hi rend="italic">Mat</hi>. 7. 12.<hi rend="italic"> Therefore all things whatsoever ye
							would that men should do unto you, do you even so to them.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> XXIV. As the <hi rend="italic">law of nature</hi> is all of it <hi rend="italic">Divine</hi>, so the <hi rend="italic">Law of Christ</hi> by conversion, (which is
						wholly explain'd in the 5, 6, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0125" n="70"/>and 7. Chapter of S. <hi rend="italic">Matthewes </hi>Gospell) is all of it also (except that one Commandement of not marrying her who is
						put away for adultery, which Christ brought for explication of the divine positive Law, against the Jewes, who did not rightly interpret the <hi rend="italic">Mosaicall
							Law</hi>) the doctrine of Nature: I say the whole Law of Christ is explain'd in the fore-named Chapters, not the whole Doctrine of Christ; for <hi rend="italic">Faith
						</hi>is a part of Christian Doctrine, which is not comprehended under the title of a <hi rend="italic">Law</hi>; for Lawes are made, and given, in reference to such
						actions as follow our will, not in order to our <hi rend="italic">Opinions</hi>, and, <hi rend="italic">Belief </hi>which being out of our power, follow not the
						Will.<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0126" n=""/></p>

					<lb/>
					<p> I. It is of it selfe manifest, that the actions of men proceed from the will, and the will from hope, and feare, insomuch as when they shall see a <hi rend="italic"
							>greater good</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">lesse evill</hi>, likely to happen to them by the breach, then observation of the Lawes, they'l wittingly violate them. The
						hope therefore which each man hath of his security, and self-preservation, consists in this, that by force or craft he may disappoint his neighbour, either openly, or
						by stratagem. Whence we may understand, that the <hi rend="italic">naturall lawes</hi>, though well understood, doe not instantly secure any man in their practise, and
						consequently, that as long as there is no caution had from the invasion of others, there remains to every man that same <hi rend="italic">primitive </hi>Right of
						selfe-defence, by such means as either he can or will make use of (that is) a <hi rend="italic">Right to all things</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">Right of warre</hi>;
						and it is sufficient for the fulfiling of the <hi rend="italic">naturall law</hi>, that a man be prepared in mind to embrace Peace when it may be had. <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0130" n="75"/></p>
					<p> II. It is an old saying, That <hi rend="italic">all lawes are silent in the time of warre</hi>, and it is a true one, not onely if we speak of the <hi rend="italic"
							>civill</hi>, but also of the <hi rend="italic">naturall lawes</hi>, provided they be referr'd not to the mind, but to the actions of men, by the third Chapter, <hi
							rend="italic">Art</hi>. 29. And we mean such a war as is of all men against all men; such as is the <hi rend="italic">meer state of nature</hi>; although in the warre
						of nation against nation a certain mean was wont to be observed. And therefore in old time there was a manner of living, and as it were a certain oeconomy, which they
						called <hi rend="italic">
							<foreign lang="gre"> &lgr;&#x03B7;&sgr;&tgr;&rgr;&igr;&kgr;&#x1F74;&ngr;, living by Rapine, </foreign>
						</hi> which was neither against the law of nature, (things then so standing) nor voyd of glory to those who exercised it with valour, not with cruelty. Their custome
						was, taking away the rest, to spare life, and abstain from Oxen fit for plough, and every instrument serviceable to husbandry, which yet is not so to be taken, as if
						they were bound to doe thus by the law of nature, but that they had regard to their own glory herein, lest by too much cruelty, they might be suspected guilty of feare. </p>
					<p> III. Since therefore the exercise of the <hi rend="italic">naturall law</hi> is necessary for the preservation of Peace, and that for the exercise of the <hi
							rend="italic">naturall law security</hi> is no lesse necessary, it is worth the considering what that is which affords such a security: for this matter nothing else
						can be imagined, but that each man provide himselfe of such meet helps, as the invasion of one on the other may bee rendered so dangerous, as either of them may think
						it better to refrain, then to meddle. But first it is plain, that the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0131" n="76"/>consent of two or three cannot make good such a security; because that the addition but of one, or
						some few on the other side, is sufficient to make the victory undoubtedly sure, and hartens the enemy to attacque us. It is therefore necessary, to the end the security
						sought for may be obtained, that the number of them who conspire in a mutuall assistance be so great, that the accession of some few to the enemies party may not prove
						to them a matter of moment sufficient to assure the victory. </p>
					<p> IV. Farthermore, how great soever the number of them is who meet on selfe-defence, if yet they agree not among themselves of some excellent means whereby to compasse
						this, but every man after his own manner shall make use of his endeavours, nothing will be done; because that divided in their opinions they will be an hinderance to
						each other, or if they agree well enough to some one action through hope of victory, spoyle, or revenge, yet afterward through diversity of wits, and Counsels, or
						emulation, and envy, with which men naturally contend, they will be so torne and rent, as they will neither give mutuall help, nor desire peace, except they be
						constrained to it by some common feare. Whence it followes, that the <hi rend="italic">consent </hi>of many, (which consists in this onely, as we have already defined
						in the foregoing section, that they direct all their actions to the same end, and the <hi rend="italic">common good</hi>) that is to say, that the society proceeding
						from mutuall help onely, yeelds not that security which they seek for, who meet, and agree in the exercise of the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0132" n="77"/>above-named <hi rend="italic">lawes of nature</hi>;
						but that somewhat else must be done, that those who have once consented for the <hi rend="italic">common good</hi>, to peace and mutuall help, may by fear be
						restrained, lest afterward they again dissent, when their private <hi rend="italic">Interest </hi>shall appear discrepant from the <hi rend="italic">common good</hi>. </p>
					<p> V. <hi rend="italic">Aristotle </hi>reckons among those animals which he calls Politique, not man only, but divers others; as the <hi rend="italic">Ant</hi>, the <hi
							rend="italic">Bee</hi>, &amp;c. which though they be destitute of reason, by which they may contract, and submit to government, notwithstanding by consenting,
						(that is to say) ensuing, or eschewing the same things, they so direct their actions to a common end, that their meetings are not obnoxious unto any seditions. Yet is
						not their gathering together a <hi rend="italic">civill government</hi>, and therefore those animals not to be termed <hi rend="italic">politicall</hi>, because their
						government is onely a consent, or many wills concurring in one object, not (as is necessary in civill government) one will. It is very true that in those creatures,
						living only by sense and appetite, their <hi rend="italic">consent </hi>of minds is so durable, as there is no need of any thing more to secure it, and (by consequence)
						to preserve peace among them, then barely their naturall inclination. But among men the case is otherwise. For first among them there is a contestation of honour and
						preferment; among beasts there is none: whence <hi rend="italic">hatred </hi>and <hi rend="italic">envy</hi>, out of which arise sedition and warre, is among men, among
						beasts no such matter. Next, the naturall appetite of Bees, and the like creatures, is conformable, and they desire the common <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0133" n="78"/>good which among them differs not from
						their private; but man scarce esteems any thing good which hath not somewhat of eminence in the enjoyment, more then that which others doe possesse. Thirdly, those
						creatures which are voyd of reason, see no defect, or think they see none, in the administration of their Common-weales; but in a multitude of men there are many who
						supposing themselves wiser then others, endeavour to innovate, and divers Innovators innovate divers wayes, which is a meer distraction, and civill warre. Fourthly,
						these brute creatures, howsoever they may have the use of their voyce to signify their affections to each other, yet want they that same art of words which is
						necessarily required to those motions in the mind, whereby good is represented to it as being better, and evill as worse then in truth it is; But the tongue of man is a
						trumpet of warre, and sedition; and it is reported of <hi rend="italic">Pericles</hi>, that he sometimes by his elegant speeches thundered, and lightened, and
						confounded whole <hi rend="italic">Greece </hi>it selfe. Fiftly, they cannot distinguish between <hi rend="italic">injury </hi>and <hi rend="italic">harme</hi>; Thence
						it happens that as long as it is well with them, they blame not their fellowes: But those men are of most trouble to the Republique, who have most leasure to be idle;
						for they use not to contend for publique places before they have gotten the victory over hunger, and cold. Last of all, the consent of those brutall creatures is
						naturall, that of men by compact onely, (that is to say) artificiall; it is therefore no matter of wonder if somewhat more be <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0134" n="79"/>needfull for men to the end they may live
						in peace. Wherefore <hi rend="italic">consent</hi>, or contracted <hi rend="italic">society</hi>, without some common power whereby particular men may be ruled through
						feare of punishment, doth not suffice to make up that security which is requisite to the exercise of <hi rend="italic">naturall justice</hi>. </p>
					<p> VI. Since therefore the <hi rend="italic">conspiring </hi>of many wills to the same end doth not suffice to preserve peace, and to make a lasting defence, it is
						requisite that in those necessary matters which concern Peace and selfe-defence, there be but <hi rend="italic">one will</hi> of all men. But this cannot.be done,
						unlesse every man will so subject <hi rend="italic">his will</hi> to <hi rend="italic">some other one</hi>, to wit, either <hi rend="italic">Man </hi>or <hi
							rend="italic">Counsell</hi>, that whatsoever his <hi rend="italic">will </hi>is in those things which are necessary to the common peace, it be received for the <hi
							rend="italic">wills </hi>of all men in generall, and of every one in particular. Now the gathering together of many men who deliberate of what is to be done, or not
						to be done, for the common good of all men, is that which I call a <hi rend="italic">COUNSELL</hi>. </p>
					<p> VII. This <hi rend="italic">submission </hi>of the <hi rend="italic">wils </hi>of all those men to the <hi rend="italic">will of one man</hi>, or <hi rend="italic"
							>one Counsell</hi>, is then made, when each one of them obligeth himself by contract to every one of the rest, not to resist the <hi rend="italic">will </hi>of that
							<hi rend="italic">one man</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">counsell</hi>, to which he hath submitted himselfe; that is, that he refuse him not the use of his wealth, and
						strength, against any others whatsoever (for he is supposed still to retain a Right of defending himselfe against violence) and this is called <hi rend="italic"
							>UNION</hi>. But we understand that to be the <hi rend="italic">will </hi>of the <hi rend="italic">counsell</hi>, which is the <hi rend="italic">will of the major <pb
								entity="DSSR_000002537_0135" n="80"/>
						part</hi> of those men of whom the Counsell consists. </p>
					<p> VIII. But though the <hi rend="italic">will </hi>it self be not voluntary, but only the beginning of voluntary actions (for we will not to will, but to <hi
							rend="italic">act </hi>) and therefore falls least of all under deliberation, and compact; yet he who submits his will to the will of an other, conveighs to that
						other the <hi rend="italic">Right </hi>of his <hi rend="italic">strength</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">faculties</hi>; insomuch as when the rest have done the same, he to
						whom they have submitted hath so much power, as by the terrour of it hee can conforme the wills of particular men unto unity, and concord. </p>
					<p> IX. Now <hi rend="italic">union </hi>thus made is called a <hi rend="italic">City</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">civill society</hi>, and also a <hi rend="italic">civill
							Person</hi>; for when there is <hi rend="italic">one will</hi> of all men, it is to be esteemed for <hi rend="italic">one Person</hi>, and by the word (<hi
							rend="italic">one</hi>) it is to be knowne, and distinguished from all particular men, as having its own Rights and properties; insomuch as neither any one Citizen,
						nor all of them together (if we except him whose will stands for the will of all) is to be <hi rend="italic">accounted </hi>the <hi rend="italic">City</hi>. A <hi
							rend="italic">CITY</hi> therefore (that we may define it) is <hi rend="italic">one Person</hi>, whose <hi rend="italic">will</hi>, by the compact of many men, is to
						be received for the <hi rend="italic">will </hi>of them all; so as he may use all the power and faculties of each particular person, to the maintenance of peace, and
						for common defence. </p>
					<p> X. But although every <hi rend="italic">City </hi>be a <hi rend="italic">civill Person</hi>, yet every <hi rend="italic">civill Person</hi> is not a <hi rend="italic"
						>City</hi>; for it may happen that many Citizens, by the permission of the City, may joyne together in <hi rend="italic">one Person</hi>, for the doing of certain <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0136" n="81"/>
						things. These now will be <hi rend="italic">civill Persons</hi>, as the companies of Merchants, and many other Convents; but <hi rend="italic">Cities </hi>they are not,
						because they have not submitted themselves to the will of the company simply, and in all things, but in certain things onely determined by the City; and on such termes
						as it is lawfull for any one of them to contend in judgement against the <hi rend="italic">body it selfe of the sodality</hi>; which is by no means allowable to a <hi
							rend="italic">Citizen </hi>against the <hi rend="italic">City</hi>; such like <hi rend="italic">societies </hi>therefore are <hi rend="italic">civill Persons</hi>
						subordinate to the <hi rend="italic">City</hi>. </p>
					<p> XI. In every city, That <hi rend="italic">Man</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Counsell</hi>, to whose will each particular man hath subjected his will (so as hath been
						declared) is said to have the <hi rend="italic">SUPREME POWER</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">CHIEFE COMMAND</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">DOMINION</hi>; which <hi
							rend="italic">power</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Right of commanding</hi>, consists in this, that each Citizen hath conveighed all his strength and power to that man,
						or Counsell; which to have done (because no man can transferre his power in a naturall manner) is nothing else then to have parted with his Right of resisting. Each <hi
							rend="italic">Citizen</hi>, as also every <hi rend="italic">subordinate civill Person</hi>, is called the <hi rend="italic">SUBJECT</hi> of him who hath the <hi
							rend="italic">chiefe command</hi>. </p>
					<p> XII. By what hath been sayed, it is sufficiently shewed, in what manner, and by what degrees <hi rend="italic">many naturall Persons</hi>, through desire of
						preserving themselves, and by mutuall feare, have growne together into <hi rend="italic">a civill Person</hi>, whom we have called a <hi rend="italic">City</hi>. But
						they who submit themselves to another for feare, either submit to him whom they <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0137" n="82"/>feare, or some other whom they confide in for protection; They act according to the
						first manner who are vanquished in warre, that they may not be slain; they according to the second, who are not yet overcome, that they may not be overcome. The first
						manner receives its beginning from <hi rend="italic">naturall Power</hi>, and may be called the <hi rend="italic">naturall beginning</hi> of a City; the latter from the
							<hi rend="italic">Counsell</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">constitution </hi>of those who meet together, which is a <hi rend="italic">beginning </hi>by <hi rend="italic"
							>institution</hi>. Hence it is, that there are two kinds of <hi rend="italic">Cities</hi>, the one <hi rend="italic">naturall</hi>, such as is the <hi rend="italic"
							>paternall</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">despoticall</hi>; the other <hi rend="italic">institutive</hi>, which may be also called <hi rend="italic">politicall</hi>. In
						the first the <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>acquires to himselfe such <hi rend="italic">Citizens </hi>as he will; in the other the <hi rend="italic">Citizens </hi>by
						their own wills appoint a <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>over themselves, whether he be <hi rend="italic">one man</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">one company of men</hi> endued
						with the <hi rend="italic">command in chiefe</hi>. But we will speak in the first place of a <hi rend="italic">City politicall</hi> or by <hi rend="italic"
						>institution</hi>, and next of a City <hi rend="italic">naturall</hi>.</p>

					<p> I. We must consider first of all what a <hi rend="italic">multitude </hi>of men (gathering themselves of their owne free wills into society) is, namely, that it is
						not any <hi rend="italic">one body</hi>, but many men, whereof each one hath his owne will, and his peculiar judgment concerning all things that may be propos'd. And
						though by particular Contracts each single man may have his own <hi rend="italic">Right</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Propriety</hi>, so as one may say <hi rend="italic"
							>This </hi>is mine, the <hi rend="italic">other</hi>, <hi rend="italic">That </hi>is his; yet will there not be any thing of which the whole multitude, as a <hi
							rend="italic">Person </hi>distinct from a single man, can rightly say, This is mine, more then <hi rend="italic">anothers</hi>. Neither must we ascribe any action to
						the multitude, as <hi rend="italic">it's <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0140" n="85"/>one</hi>, but (if all, or more of them doe agree) it will not be an Action, but as many actions, as Men. For although in some
						great Sedition, it's commonly said, That the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>of that City have taken up Armes; yet is it true of those onely who are in Armes, or who
						consent to them. For the <hi rend="italic">City</hi>, which is <hi rend="italic">one Person</hi>, cannot take up Armes against it selfe. Whatsoever therefore is done by
						the multitude, must be understood to be done by every one of those by whom it is made up; and that he, who being in the Multitude, and yet consented not, nor gave any
						helps to the things that were done by it, must be judg'd to have done nothing. Besides, in a multitude not yet reduc'd into one Person, in that manner as hath been
						said, there remaines that same <hi rend="italic">state of nature</hi> in which <hi rend="italic">all things belong to all men</hi> and there is no place for <hi
							rend="italic">Meum </hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">Tuum</hi>, which is call'd Dominion, and <hi rend="italic">Propriety</hi>, by reason that that security is not
						yet extant which we have declar'd above to be necessarily requisite for the practise of the <hi rend="italic">Naturall Laws</hi>. </p>
					<p> Multitude, &amp;c.] <hi rend="italic">The Doctrine of the Power of a City over it's Citizens, almost wholly depends on the understanding of the difference which
							is between a multitude of men ruling, and a multitude ruled: For such is the nature of a City, That a multitude, or company of Citizens, not onely may have command,
							but may also be subject to command, but in diverse senses; which difference I did beleeve was clearly enough explained in this first Article,, but by the objections
							of many against those things which follow, I discern otherwise; wherefore it <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0141" n="86"/>seemed good to me, to the end I might make a fuller explication, to adde these few
							things.</hi>
					</p>
					<p><hi rend="italic">By Multitude, because it is a collective word, we understand more then one, so as a multitude of men is the same with many men; The same word,
							because it is of the singular number, signifies one thing, namely, one multitude; but in neither sense can a multitude be understood to have one will given to it by
							nature, but to either a severall; and therefore neither is any one action whatsoever to be attributed to it: therefore a Multitude cannot promise, contract, acquire
							Right, conveigh Right, act, have, Possesse, and the like, unlesse it be every one apart, and</hi> Man by <hi rend="italic">Man; so as there must be as many promises,
							compacts, rights, and actions, as Men. therefore a Multitude is no naturall Person; but if the same Multitude doe Contract one with another, that the will of one man,
							or the agreeing wills of the major part of them, shall be received for the will of all, then it becomes one Person; for it is endu'd with a will, and therefore can
							doe voluntary actions, such as are Commanding, making Lawes, acquiring and transferring of Right, and so forth; and it is oftner call'd the People, then the
							Multitude. We must therefore distinguish thus. then we say the People, or Multitude, wills, commands, or doth any thing, it is understood that the City which
							Commands, tills and Acts by the will of one, or the concurring wills of more, which cannot be done, but in an Assembly; But as oft as any thing is said to be done by
							a Multitude of Men, whether great, or small, without the will of that man, or assembly of men, that's understood to be done by a subjected People, that is, by many
							single Citizens <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0142" n="87"/>together, and not proceeding from one till, but from diverse wills of diverse men, who are Citizens, and Subjects, but not a City.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> II. Next, we must consider that every one of the Multitude (by whose meanes there may be a beginning to make up the City) must agree with the rest, that in those
						matters which shall be propounded by any one in the Assembly, that be received for the will of all which the major part shall approve of; for otherwise there will be no
						will at all of a Multitude of Men, whose Wills and Votes differ so variously. Now if any one will not consent, the rest notwithstanding shall among themselves
						constitute the City without him: Whence it will come to passe, that the City retaines its primitive Right against the Dissentour, that is, the <hi rend="italic">Right
							of War</hi>, as against an Enemy. </p>
					<p> III. But because we said in the foregoing Chapter, the sixth Article, That there was requir'd to the security of men, not onely their Consent, but also the Subjection
						of their wills in such things as were necessary to Peace and Defence; and that in that <hi rend="italic">Union</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Subjection</hi>, the nature
						of a <hi rend="italic">City </hi>consisted; We must discerne now in this place, out of those things which may be propounded, discuss'd, and stated in an Assembly of
						men, (all whose wills are contain'd in the will of the major part) what things are <hi rend="italic">necessary to Peace</hi>, and common defence: But first of all, it
						is necessary to Peace, that a man be so farre forth protected against the violence of others, that he may live securely, that is, that he may have <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0143" n="88"/>no just cause to fear
						others, so long as he doth them no injury. Indeed, to make men altogether safe from mutuall harmes, so as they cannot be hurt, or injuriously kill'd, is impossible, and
						therefore comes not within deliberation. But care may be had there be no just cause of fear; for security is the end wherefore men submit themselves to others, which if
						it be not had, no man is suppos'd to have submitted himselfe to ought, or to have quitted his Right to all things, before that there was a care had of his security. </p>
					<p> IV. It is not enough to obtain this security, that every one of those who are now growing up into a City, doe covenant with the rest, either by words, or writing, <hi
							rend="italic">Not to steal, not to kill</hi>, and to observe the like Lawes; for the pravity of humane disposition is manifest to all, and by experience too well
						known how little (removing the punishment) men are kept to their duties, through conscience of their promises. We must therefore provide for our security, not by <hi
							rend="italic">Compacts</hi>, but by <hi rend="italic">Punishments</hi>; and there is then sufficient provision made, when there are so great punishments appointed for
						every injury, as apparently it prove a greater evill to have done it, then not to have done it: for all men, by a necessity of nature, chuse that which <hi
							rend="italic">to them appears to be the lesse evill</hi>. </p>
					<p> V. Now the right of punishing is then understood to be given to any one, when every man Contracts not to assist him who is to be punished. But I will call this <hi
						rend="italic">Right, The Sword of Justice</hi>. But these kind of <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0144" n="89"/>contracts men observe well enough, for the most part, till either themselves, or their near friends
						are to suffer. </p>
					<p> VI. Because therefore for the security of particular men, and, by consequence for the common peace, it is <hi rend="italic">necessary </hi>that the <hi rend="italic"
							>right </hi>of using the <hi rend="italic">Sword </hi>for punishment, be transferred to <hi rend="italic">some Man</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Counsell</hi>, that Man
						or Counsell is necessarily understood by Right to have the <hi rend="italic">supreme power</hi> in the City. For he that by Right punisheth at his own discretion, by
						Right compells all men to all things which he himselfe wills; then which a greater command cannot be imagined. </p>
					<p> VII. But in vain doe they worship peace at home, who cannot defend themselves against forrainers; neither is it possible for them to protect themselves against
						forrainers, whose forces are not united; and therefore it is <hi rend="italic">necessary </hi>for the preservation of particulars, that there be some <hi rend="italic"
							>one Counsell</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">one man</hi>, who hath the Right to arm, to gather together, to unite so many Citizens in all dangers, and on all occasions,
						as shall be needfull for common defence against the certain number, and strength of the enemy; and again, (as often as he shall finde it expedient) to make peace with
						them. We must understand therefore, that particular Citizens have conveighed their whole <hi rend="italic">Right of Warre</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Peace</hi>, unto
						some <hi rend="italic">one Man</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Counsell</hi>; And that this right (which we may call the <hi rend="italic">Sword of Warre</hi>) belongs to the
						same <hi rend="italic">Man</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Counsell</hi>, to whom the <hi rend="italic">Sword of Justice</hi> belongs; for no Man can by Right compell
						Citizens to take up armes, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0145" n="90"/>be at the expences of Warre, but he who by Right can punish him who doth not obey. Both <hi rend="italic">Swords </hi>therefore, as well
						this of <hi rend="italic">War</hi>, as that of <hi rend="italic">Justice</hi>, even by the constitution it selfe of a City, and essentially, doe belong to the <hi
							rend="italic">chiefe command</hi>. </p>
					<p> VIII. But because the <hi rend="italic">right of the Sword</hi> is nothing else but to have power by right to use the sword at his own will, it followes, that the <hi
							rend="italic">judgement </hi>of its right use pertaines to the same party: for if the <hi rend="italic">power of judging</hi> were in one, and the power of executing
						in another, nothing would be done. For in vain would he give judgement, who could not execute his commands; or if he executed them by the power of another, he himselfe
						is not said to have the <hi rend="italic">power of the Sword</hi>, but that other, to whom he is onely an Officer. All <hi rend="italic">judgement </hi>therefore in a
							<hi rend="italic">City </hi>belongs to him who hath the swords, (i.e.) to him, who hath the <hi rend="italic">supreme authority</hi>. </p>
					<p> IX. Furthermore, since it no lesse, nay it much more conduceth to Peace to prevent brawles from arising, then to appease them being risen; and that all controversies
						are bred from hence, that the opinions of men differ concerning <hi rend="italic">Meum &amp; Tuum, just and unjust, profitable and unprofitable, good and evill,
							honest and dishonest</hi>, and the like, which every man esteems according to his own judgement; it belongs to the same <hi rend="italic">chiefe power</hi> to make
						some common Rules for all men, and to declare them publiquely, by which every man may know what may be called <hi rend="italic">his</hi>, what <hi rend="italic"
							>anothers</hi>, what <hi rend="italic">just</hi>, what <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi>, what <hi rend="italic">honest</hi>, what <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0146" n="91"/><hi rend="italic">dishonest</hi>, what
							<hi rend="italic">good</hi>, what <hi rend="italic">evill</hi>, that is summarily, what is <hi rend="italic">to be done</hi>, what to be <hi rend="italic">avoyded
						</hi>in our common course of life. But those Rules and measures are usually called the <hi rend="italic">civill Lawes</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">Lawes of the
						City</hi>, as being the <hi rend="italic">Commands </hi>of him who hath the <hi rend="italic">supreme power</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">City</hi>. And the <hi
							rend="italic">CIVILL LAWES</hi> (that we may define them) are nothing else but the commands of him who hath the <hi rend="italic">chiefe authority</hi> in the City,
						for direction of the future actions of his Citizens. </p>
					<p> X. Furthermore, since the affaires of the City, both those of <hi rend="italic">Warre</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Peace</hi>, cannot possibly be all administred by
							<hi rend="italic">one man</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">one Counsell</hi>, without <hi rend="italic">Officers </hi>and <hi rend="italic">subordinate Magistrates</hi>,
						and that it appertains to Peace, and common defence, that they to whom it belongs justly to judge of controversies, to search into neighbouring counsels, prudently to
						wage war, and on all hands warily to attend the benefit of the City, should also rightly exercise their offices; it is consonant to reason, that they depend on, and be
						chosen by him who hath the <hi rend="italic">chiefe command</hi> both in <hi rend="italic">War</hi>, and in <hi rend="italic">Peace</hi>. </p>
					<p> XI. It is also manifest, that all voluntary actions have their beginning from, and necessarily depend on the will, and that the will of doing, or omitting ought,
						depends on the opinion of the <hi rend="italic">good </hi>and <hi rend="italic">evill </hi>of the <hi rend="italic">reward</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">punishment</hi>,
						which a man conceives he shall receive by the act, or omission; so as the actions of all men are ruled by the opinions of each; wherefore by evident and necessary
						inference, we may understand that it very much concerns the interest of <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0147" n="92"/>Peace, that no opinions or doctrines be delivered to Citizens, by which they may imagine, that
						either by Right they may not obey the <hi rend="italic">Lawes </hi>of the City, that is, the commands of that <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, or <hi rend="italic"
						>Counsell</hi>, to whom the supreme power is committed, or that it is lawfull for to resist him, or that a lesse punishment remaines for him that denies, then him that
						yeelds obedience. For if one command somewhat to be done under penalty of naturall death, another forbids it under pain of eternall death, and both by their own Right,
						it will follow that the Citizens, although innocent, are not onely by Right punishable, but that the City it selfe is altogether dissolved; for no man can serve two
						Masters: nor is he lesse, but rather more, a Master, whom we believe we are to obey for feare of damnation, then he whom we obey for feare of temporall death. It
						followes therefore, that this one, whether <hi rend="italic">Man</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Court</hi>, to whom the City hath committed the <hi rend="italic">supreme
							power</hi>, have also this Right, That he both judge what opinions and doctrines are enemies unto peace, and also that he forbid them to be taught. </p>
					<p> Judge what opinions, &amp;c.] <hi rend="italic">There is scarce any Principle, neither in the worship of God, nor humane sciences, from whence there may not
							spring dissentions, discords, reproaches, and by degrees war it selfe; neither doth this happen by reason of the falshood of the Principle, but of the disposition of
							men, who seeming wise to themselves, will needs appear such to all others: But though such dissentions cannot be hindered from arising, yet may they be restrained by
							the exercise of the supreme Power, that they Prove <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0148" n="93"/>no hinderance to the publique peace. of these kind of opinions therefore I have not spoken of in this place. There
							are certain doctrines wherewith Subjects being tainted, they verily believe that obedience may be refused to the City, and that by Right they may, nay ought, to
							oppose, and fight against chiefe Princes, and dignities. Such are those, which whether directly, and openly, or more obscurely, and by consequence require obedience
							to be given to others beside them to whom the supreme authority is committed. I deny not, but this reflects on that Power which many living under other government,
							ascribe to the chiefe head of the Church of </hi>Rome,<hi rend="italic"> and also on that, which elsewhere out of that Church, Bishops require in theirs, to be given
							to them; and last of all, on that liberty which the lower sort of Citizens under pretence of Religion doe challenge to themselves; for what civill war was there ever
							in the Christian world, which did not either grow from, or was nourisht by this Root? The judgement therefore of doctrines, whether they be repugnant to civill
							obedience or not, and if they be repugnant, the Power of prohibiting them to be taught, I doe here attribute to the civill authority; for since there is no man who
							grants not to the City the judgement of those things which belong to its Peace, and defence, and it is manifest, that the opinions which I have already recited do
							relate to its Peace, it followes necessarily, that the examination of those opinions, whether they be such, or not, must be referred to the City, that is, to him who
							hath the supreme authority.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> XII. Last of all, from this consideration, that each Citizen hath submitted his Will to his who hath the <hi rend="italic">Supreme Command</hi><pb
						entity="DSSR_000002537_0149" n="94"/>" in the City, so as he
						may not employ his strength against him; it followes manifestly, that whatsoever shall be done by him who commands, must not be punisht; for as he who hath not power
						enough, cannot punish him naturally; so neither can he punish him by Right, who by Right hath not sufficient power. </p>
					<p> XIII. It is most manifest by what hath been said, That in every perfect City (that is, where no Citizen hath <hi rend="italic">Right </hi>to use his faculties, at his
						owne discretion, for the preservation of himselfe, or where the <hi rend="italic">Right of the private Sword</hi> is excluded) there is a <hi rend="italic">Supreme
							Power</hi> in some one, greater then which cannot by Right be conferr'd by men, or greater then which no mortall man can have over himself. But that power, greater
						then which cannot by men, be conveigh'd on a man, we call ABSOLUTE: for whosoever hath so submitted his will to the will of the City, <hi rend="italic">That he can,
							unpunisht, doe any thing, make Lawes, judge Controversies, set Penalties</hi>, make use, at his own pleasure, of the <hi rend="italic">strength</hi>, and <hi
							rend="italic">wealth of men</hi>, and all this by Right, truly he hath given him the greatest dominion that can be granted. This same may be confirm'd by experience
						in all the Cities which are, or ever have beene; for though it be sometimes in doubt, <hi rend="italic">what Man</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Counsell</hi>, hath the <hi
							rend="italic">Chief Command</hi>, yet ever there is such a Command, and alwayes exercis'd, except in the time of Sedition, and Civill War, and then there are two <hi
								rend="italic">Chiefe Commands</hi> made out of one: Now those seditious persons who dispute <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0150" n="95"/>against absolute Authority, doe not so much care to destroy it, as to
						conveigh it on others; for removing this power, they together take away Civill Society, and a confusion of all things returnes. There is so much obedience joyn'd to
						this absolute Right of the Chief Ruler, as is necessarily requir'd for the Government of the City, that is to say, so much as that Right of his may not be granted in
						vaine. Now this kind of obedience, although for some reasons it may sometimes, by Right, be deny'd, yet because a greater cannot be perform'd, we will call it SIMPLE.
						But the obligation to performe this growes not immediately from that Contract by which we have conveigh'd all our Right on the City, but mediately from hence, That,
						without obedience, the Cities Right would be frustrate, and by consequence there would be no City constituted. For it is one thing if I say, I give you Right to Command
						what you will; another, if I say, I will doe whatsoever you Command; and the Command may be such, as I would rather die then doe it; forasmuch therefore as no man can
						be bound to will being kill'd, much lesse is he tyed to that, which to him is worse then death: if therefore I be commanded to kill my self, I am not bound to doe it;
						for though I deny to doe it, yet the Right of dominion is not frustrated, since others may be found, who being commanded, will not refuse to doe it; neither doe I
						refuse to doe that which I have contracted to doe. In like manner, if the Chief Ruler command any man to kill <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0151" n="96"/>him, he is not tyed to doe it, because it cannot be
						conceiv'd that he made any such Covenant; nor if he command to execute a Parent, whether he be innocent, or guilty, and condemned by the Law, since there are others,
						who, being commanded, will doe that, and a Son will rather die, then live infamous, and hated of all the world. There are many other cases, in which, since the Commands
						are shamefull to be done by some, and not by others, Obedience may, by Right, be perform'd by these, and refus'd by those; and this, without breach of that absolute
						Right which was given to the Chief Ruler. For in no case is the Right taken away from him, of slaying those who shall refuse to obey him. But they who thus kill men,
						although by Right given them from him that hath it, yet if they use that Right otherwise then right Reason requires, they sin against the Lawes of Nature, (that is)
						against God. </p>
					<p> Absolute] <hi rend="italic">A popular state openly challengeth absolute dominion, and the Citizens oppose it not, for in the gathering together of many men, they
							acknowledge the face of a City; and even the unskilfull understand, that matters there are rul'd by Counsell. Yet monarchy is no lesse a City, then Democraty, and
							absolute Kings have their Counsellours, from whom they will take advice, and suffer their Power, in matters of greater consequence, to be guided, but not recall'd.
							But it appears not to most men how a City is contain'd in the person of a King; and therefore they object against Absolute Command: First, that if any man had such a
							Right, the condition of the Citizens <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0152" n="97"/>would be miserable: For thus they think, he will take all, spoil all, kill all; and every man counts it his onely happinesse that
							he is not already spoil'd and kill'd. But why should he doe thus? not because he can; for unlesse he have a mind to it, he will not doe it. till he, to please one, or
							some few, spoil all the rest? First, though by Right, that is, without injury to them, he may doe it, yet can he not doe it justly, that is, without breach of the
							Naturall Lawes, and injury against God. And therefore there is some security for Subjects in the Oaths which princes take. Next, if he could justly doe it, or that he
							made no account of his Oath, yet appeares there no reason why he should desire it, since he findes no good in it. But it cannot be deny'd but a prince may sometimes
							have an inclination to doe wickedly; but grant then that thou hadst given him a power which were not absolute, but so much onely as suffic'd to defend thee from the
							injuries of others, which, if thou wilt be safe, is necessary for thee to give; are not all the same things to be feared? for he that hath strength enough to protect
							all, wants not sufficiency to oppresse all. Here is no other difficulty then, but that humane affaires cannot be without some inconvenience. And this inconvenience it
							self is in the Citizens, not in the Government; for if men could rule themselves, every man by his own command, that's to say, could they live according to the Lawes
							of Nature, there would be no need at all of a City, nor of a common coercive power. Secondly, they object, That there is no Dominion in the Christian world Absolute;
							which indeed is not true, for all Monarchies, and all other States, are so; for although <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0153" n="98"/>they, who have the chief Command, doe not all those things they would, and
							what they know profitable to the City, the reason of that is not the defect of Right in them, but the consideration of their Citizens, who busied about their private
							interest, and carelesse of what tends to the publique, cannot sometimes be drawn to performe their duties without the hazard of the City. therefore princes sometimes
							forbear the exercise of their Right, and prudently remit somewhat of the act, but nothing of their Right.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> XIV. Neither can any man give somewhat to himselfe; for he is already suppos'd to have what he can give himself; nor can he be oblig'd to himselfe, for the same party
						being both <hi rend="italic">the obliged</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">the Obliger</hi>, and the Obliger having power to release the obliged, it were meerly in vain for a
						man to be obliged to himselfe, because he can release himself at his own pleasure; and he that can doe this, is already actually free. Whence its plaine, that the City
						is not tyed to the <hi rend="italic">Civill Lawes</hi>; for the Civill Lawes are the Lawes of the City, by which, if she were engag'd, she should be engag'd to her
						selfe. Neither can the City be oblig'd to her Citizen, because, if he will, he can free her from her obligation; and he will, as oft as she wills, (for the will of
						every Citizen is in all things comprehended in the will of the City); the City therefore is free when she pleaseth, that is, she is now actually free; but the will of a
							<hi rend="italic">Councell</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">one</hi> who hath the <hi rend="italic">Supreme Authority</hi> given him, is the will of the City; he therefore
						containes the wills of all particular Citizens: Therefore neither is <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0154" n="99"/><hi rend="italic">he </hi>bound to the <hi rend="italic">Civill Lawes</hi> (for this is to be bound
						to himself) nor to any of his Citizens. </p>
					<p> XV. Now because (as hath been shewn above) before the constitution of a City <hi rend="italic">all things belong'd to all men</hi>, nor is there that thing which any
						man can so call <hi rend="italic">his</hi>, as any other may not, by the same Right, claime as <hi rend="italic">his own</hi>, (for where all things are <hi
							rend="italic">common</hi>, there can be nothing <hi rend="italic">proper </hi>to any man) it followes, that <hi rend="italic">propriety </hi>receiv'd its beginning
						when Cities receiv'd theirs, and that that onely is <hi rend="italic">proper </hi>to each man which he can keep by the Lawes, and the power of the whole City, (that is)
						of him on whom its <hi rend="italic">chief command</hi> is conferr'd. Whence we understand, that each particular Citizen hath a <hi rend="italic">propriety</hi>, to
						which none of his fellow-Citizens hath Right, because they are tyed to the same Lawes; but he hath no propriety in which the <hi rend="italic">Chief Ruler</hi> (whose
						Commands are the Lawes, whose will contains the will of each man, and who, by every single person, is constituted the <hi rend="italic">Supreme Judge</hi>) hath not a
						Right. But although there be many things which the City permits to its Citizens, and therefore they may sometimes goe to Law against their <hi rend="italic">Chief</hi>;
						yet is not that action belonging to <hi rend="italic">Civill Right</hi>, but to <hi rend="italic">Naturall Equity</hi>; neither is it concerning what by Right he <hi
							rend="italic">may doe</hi> who hath the <hi rend="italic">Supreme power</hi>, but what he hath been <hi rend="italic">willing should be done</hi>, and therefore he
						shall be judge himself, as though (the equity of the cause being well understood) he could not give wrong judgment. <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0155" n="100"/></p>
					<p> Propriety receiv'd its beginning, &amp;c.] <hi rend="italic">What's objected by some, That the propriety of goods, even before the constitution of Cities, was
							found in Fathers of Families, that objection is vaine, because I have already declar'd, That a Family is a little City. For the Sonnes of a Family have a propriety of
							their goods granted them by their Father, distinguisht indeed from the rest of the Sons of the same Family, but not from the propriety of the Father himself; but the
							Fathers of diverse Families, who are subject neither to any common Father, nor Lord, have a common Right in all things.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> What by Right he may doe, &amp;c.]<hi rend="italic"> As often as a Citizen is granted to have an action of Law against the Supreme, i.e. against the City, the
							question is not in that action, whether the City may, by Right, keep possession of the thing in controversie, but whether by the Lawes formerly made she would keep
							it; for the Law is the declared will of the Supreme: since then the City may raise money from the Citizens under two Titles, either as Tribute, or as Debt, in the
							former case there is no action of Law allowed; for there can be no question whether the City have Right to require Tribute: in the latter it is allowed, because the
							City will take nothing from its Citizens by fraud, or cunning, and yet if need require, all they have, openly; and therefore he that condemnes this place, saying,
							That by this doctrine it is easie for princes to free themselves from their Debts, he does it impertinently.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> XVI. <hi rend="italic">Theft, Murther, Adultery, and all injuries</hi> are forbid by the Lawes of nature; but what is to be called <hi rend="italic">Theft</hi>, what <pb
						entity="DSSR_000002537_0156" n="101"/>
							<hi rend="italic">Murther</hi>, what <hi rend="italic">Adultery</hi>, what <hi rend="italic">injury </hi>in a Citizen, this is not to be determined by the <hi
							rend="italic">naturall</hi>, but by the <hi rend="italic">civill Law</hi>: for not every taking away of the thing which another possesseth, but onely <hi
							rend="italic">another mans goods</hi> is <hi rend="italic">theft</hi>; but what is ours, and what anothers, is a question belonging to the <hi rend="italic">civill
							Law</hi>. In like manner, not every killing of a man is <hi rend="italic">Murther</hi>, but onely that which the <hi rend="italic">civill Law</hi> forbids; neither is
						all encounter with women <hi rend="italic">Adultery</hi>, but onely that which the civill Law prohibits. Lastly, all breach of promise is an <hi rend="italic"
						>injury</hi>, where the promise it selfe is lawfull, but where there is no <hi rend="italic">Right </hi>to make any compact, there can be no conveighance of <hi
							rend="italic">it</hi>, and therefore there can no <hi rend="italic">injury</hi> follow, as hath been said in the second Chapter, <hi rend="italic">Artic</hi>. 17. Now
						what we may contract for, and what not, depends wholly upon the <hi rend="italic">civill Lawes</hi>. The City of <hi rend="italic">Lacedoemon </hi>therefore rightly
						ordered that those young men who could so take away certain goods from others as not to be caught, should goe unpunisht; for it was nothing else, but to make a Law that
						what was so acquired should be <hi rend="italic">their own</hi>, and not <hi rend="italic">anothers</hi>. Rightly also is that man every where slain, whom we kill in
						warre, or by the necessity of selfe-defence. So also that copulation which in one City is <hi rend="italic">Matrimony</hi>, in another will be judged <hi rend="italic"
							>Adultery</hi>. Also those contracts which make up <hi rend="italic">Marriage </hi>in one Citizen, doe not so in another, although of the same City. because that he
						who is forbidden by the City (that is by that <hi rend="italic">one man</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Councell</hi>, whose the <hi rend="italic">supreme power</hi> is) to
						contract ought, hath no Right to make any contract, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0157" n="102"/>therefore having made any, it is not valid, and by consequence, no <hi rend="italic">Marriage</hi>. But his
						contract which received no prohibition, was therefore of force, and so was Matrimony: neither addes it any force to any unlawfull contracts, that they were made by an
						Oath, or Sacrament, for those adde nothing to the strengthning of the contract, as hath been said above <hi rend="italic">Chap</hi>. 2. <hi rend="italic">Artic</hi>.
						22. What therefore <hi rend="italic">Theft</hi>, what <hi rend="italic">Murther</hi>, what <hi rend="italic">Adultery</hi>, and in generall what <hi rend="italic"
							>injury is</hi>, must be known by the <hi rend="italic">civill Lawes</hi>, that is, the commands of him who hath the <hi rend="italic">supreme authority</hi>. </p>
					<p> That they were made by an Oath or Sacrament, &amp;c.] <hi rend="italic">Whether Matrimony bee a Sacrament (in which sense that word is used by some Divines) or
							not, it is not my purpose to dispute: Onely I say, that the legitimate contract of a man and woman to live together, i.e. granted by the civill Law, whether it be a
							Sacrament, or not, is surely a legitimate Marriage; but that copulation which the City hath prohibited is no marriage, since it is of t he essence of Marriage to be a
							legitimate contract. There were legitimate marriages in many places, as among the Jewes, the Grecians, the Romans, which yet might be dissolved. But with those who
							permit no such contracts, but by a Law that they shall never be broke, Wedlock cannot be dissolved; and the reason is, because the City hath commanded it to be
							indissoluble, not because Matrimony is a Sacrament. Wherefore the ceremonies which at weddings are to be performed in the Temple, to blesse, or (if I may say so) to
							consecrate the husband and wife, will perhaps belong only to the office of Clergy-men; all the rest, namely who, when, and by what <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0158" n="103"/>contracts Marriages may be made,
							pertains to the Lawes of the City.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> XVII. This same <hi rend="italic">supreme command</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">absolute power</hi>, seems so harsh to the greatest part of men, as they hate the very
						naming of them; which happens chiefly through want of knowledge, what <hi rend="italic">humane nature</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">civill Lawes</hi> are, and partly
						also through their default, who when they are invested with so great authority, abuse their power to their own lust. That they may therefore avoyd this kind of <hi
							rend="italic">supreme authority</hi>, some of them will have a City well enough constituted, if they who shall be the Citizens convening, doe agree concerning
						certaine Articles propounded, and in that convent agitated and approved; and doe command them to be observed, and punishments prescribed to be inflicted on them who
						shall break them: to which purpose, and also to the repelling of a forraign enemy, they appoint a certain and limited return, with this condition, that if that suffice
						not, they may call a new convention of estates. Who sees not in a City thus constituted, that the Assembly who prescribed those things had an <hi rend="italic">absolute
							power</hi>? If therefore the <hi rend="italic">Assembly </hi>continue, or from time to time have a certain day, and place of meeting, that <hi rend="italic">power
						</hi>will be perpetuall. But if they wholly dissolve, either the City dissolves with them, and so all is returned to the <hi rend="italic">state of War</hi>, or else
						there is somewhere a power left to punish those who shall transgresse the Lawes, whosoever, or how many soever they be that have it, which cannot possibly be without an
						<hi rend="italic">absolute power</hi>: for he that by <hi rend="italic">right </hi>hath this <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0159" n="104"/>might given, by punishments to restrain what Citizens he pleaseth, hath
						such a power, as a greater cannot possibly be given by any Citizens. </p>
					<p> XVIII. It is therefore manifest, that in every City there is some <hi rend="italic">one man</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Councell</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Court</hi>,
						who by Right hath as great a power over each single Citizen, as each man hath over himselfe considered out of that civill state, that is, <hi rend="italic">supreme
						</hi>and <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi>, to be limited onely by the strength and forces of the City it selfe, and by nothing else in the world: for if his power were
						limited, that limitation must necessarily proceed from some greater power; For he that prescribes limits, must have a greater power then he who is confin'd by them; now
						that confining power is either without limit, or is again restrained by some other greater then it selfe, and so we shall at length arrive to a power which hath no
						other limit, but that which is the <hi rend="italic">terminus ultimus</hi> of the forces of all the Citizens together. That same is called the <hi rend="italic">supreme
							command</hi>, and if it bee committed to a <hi rend="italic">councell</hi>, a <hi rend="italic">supreme councell</hi>, but if to one man, the <hi rend="italic"
							>supreme Lord</hi> of the City. Now the notes of <hi rend="italic">supreme command</hi> are these, <hi rend="italic">To make and abrogate Lawes</hi>, <hi
							rend="italic">To </hi>determine <hi rend="italic">War and peace</hi>, to know, and judge of all <hi rend="italic">controversies</hi>, either by himselfe, or by <hi
							rend="italic">Judges</hi> appointed by him; to elect all <hi rend="italic">Magistrates</hi>; <hi rend="italic">Ministers</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Counsellors</hi>.
						Lastly, if there be any man who by Right can doe some one action which is not lawfull for any Citizen or Citizens to doe beside himselfe, that man hath obtained <hi
							rend="italic">the supreme power</hi>: For those things which by Right may not <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0160" n="105"/>be done by any one or many Citizens, the City it selfe can onely doe: He therefore that
						doth those things useth the Cities Right, which is <hi rend="italic">the supreme power</hi>. </p>
					<p> XIX. They who compare a City and its Citizens, with a man and his members, almost all say, that he who hath the <hi rend="italic">supreme power</hi> in the City, is
						in relation to the whole City, such as the head is to the whole man; But it appeares by what hath been already said, that he who is endued with such a power, (whether
						it be a <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, or a <hi rend="italic">Court</hi>) hath a relation to the City, not as that of the head, but of the soule to the body. For it is the
						soule by which a man hath a will, that is, can either will, or nill; so by him who hath the <hi rend="italic">supreme power</hi>, and no otherwise, the City hath a
						will, and can either will or nill. A Court of Counsellors is rather to be compared with the head, or one Counsellor, whose only Counsell (if of any one alone) the <hi
							rend="italic">chief Ruler</hi> makes use of in matters of greatest moment: for the office of the head is to counsell, as the soules is to command. </p>
					<p> XX. Forasmuch as the <hi rend="italic">supreme command</hi> is constituted by vertue of the compacts which each single Citizen, or subject, mutually makes with the
						other. but all contracts, as they receive their force from the contractors, so by their consent they lose it again, and are broken; perhaps some may inferre hence, that
						by the consent of all the subjects together, the <hi rend="italic">supreme authority</hi> may be wholly taken away. Which inference if it were true, I cannot discerne
						what danger would thence by <hi rend="italic">Right </hi>arise to the <hi rend="italic">supreme Commanders</hi>. For since it is supposed, that <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0161" n="106"/>each one hath obliged
						himselfe to each other, if any one of them shall refuse, whatsoever the rest shall agree to doe, he is bound notwithstanding; neither can any man without injury to me,
						doe that which by contract made with me, he hath obliged himselfe not to doe. But it is not to be imagined that ever it will happen, that all the subjects together, not
						so much as one excepted, will combine against the <hi rend="italic">supreme power</hi>; wherefore there is no feare for <hi rend="italic">Rulers in chiefe</hi>, that by
						any <hi rend="italic">Right </hi>they can be despoyled of their authority. If notwithstanding it were granted, that their <hi rend="italic">Right </hi>depended onely on
						that contract which each man makes with his fellow-citizen, it might very easily happen, that they might be robbed of that Dominion under pretence of Right; for
						subjects being called either by the command of the City, or seditiously flocking together, most men think that the consents of all are contained in the votes of the
						greater part. Which in truth is false; for it is not from nature that the consent of the major part should be received for the consent of all, neither is it true in
						tumults, but it proceeds from civill institution, and is then onely true, when that <hi rend="italic">Man </hi>or <hi rend="italic">Court </hi>which hath the <hi
							rend="italic">supreme power</hi>, assembling his subjects, by reason of the greatnesse of their number, allowes those that are elected a power of speaking for those
						who elected them, and will have the major part of voyces, in such matters as are by him propounded to be discust, to be as effectuall as the whole. But we cannot
						imagine that he who is <hi rend="italic">chiefe</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ever </hi>convened his subjects with intention that <hi rend="italic">they <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0162" n="107"/>should</hi> dispute
						his Right, unlesse, weary of the burthen of his charge, he declared in plain termes, that he renounces and abandons his government. Now because most men through
						ignorance esteem not the consent of the major part of Citizens only, but even of a very few, provided <hi rend="italic">they be of their opinion</hi>, for the consent
						of the whole <hi rend="italic">City</hi>, it may very well seem to them, that the <hi rend="italic">supreme authority</hi> may by right be abrogated, so it be done in
						some great Assembly of Citizens by the votes of the greater number; But though a government be constituted by the contracts of particular men with particulars, yet its
						Right depends not on that obligation onely; there is another tye also toward him who commands; for each Citizen compacting with his fellow, sayes thus, <hi
							rend="italic">I conveigh my Right on this party, upon condition, that you passe yours to the same</hi>; by which means, that Right which every man had before to use
						his faculties to his own advantage, is now wholly translated on some certain man, or Councell, for the common benefit; wherefore what by the mutuall contracts each one
						hath made with the other, what by the donation of Right which every man is bound to ratifie to him that commands, the government is upheld by a double obligation from
						the Citizens, first that which is due to their fellow citizens, next that which they owe to their prince. Wherefore no subjects how many soever they be, can with any
						Right despoyle him who bears the chiefe Rule, of his authority, even without his own consent.<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0163" n="108"/></p>

					<p>XVIII.  How a Citizen is freed from subjection.</p>
					<lb/>
					<p> I. We have already spoken of a <hi rend="italic">City by institution</hi> in its Genus; we will now say somewhat of its <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0165" n="110"/>species. As for the difference of Cities, it
						is taken from the difference of the Persons, to whom the <hi rend="italic">Supreme Power</hi> is committed; this <hi rend="italic">power </hi>is committed either to <hi
							rend="italic">one Man</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Councell</hi>, or some <hi rend="italic">one Court</hi> consisting of many men. Furthermore, a <hi rend="italic"
							>Councell of many men</hi>, consists either of all the Citizens, (insomuch as every man of them hath a Right to Vote, and an interest in the ordering of the greatest
						affaires, if he will himselfe) or of a part onely; from whence there arise three sorts of Government: The one, when the <hi rend="italic">Power </hi>is in a <hi
							rend="italic">Councell</hi>, where every Citizen hath a right to Vote, and it is call'd a DEMOCRATY. The other, when <hi rend="italic">it </hi>is in a <hi
							rend="italic">Councell</hi>, where not all, but some part onely have their suffrages, and we call it an ARISTOCRATY. The third is that, when the <hi rend="italic"
							>Supreme Authority</hi> rests onely in one, and it is stiled a MONARCHY. In the first, he that governes is called <foreign lang="gre">
							<hi rend="italic"> &#x0394;&#x1FC6;&mgr;&ogr;&sgr;</hi>
						</foreign>, The PEOPLE. In the second, the NOBLES. In the third, the MONARCH. </p>
					<p> II. Now, although Ancient Writers of Politiques have introduc'd three other kindes of Government opposite to these, to wit, Anarchy or confusion to <hi rend="italic"
							>Democraty</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Oligarchy</hi>, that is, the command of some few, to <hi rend="italic">Aristocraty</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Tyranny </hi>to <hi
							rend="italic">Monarchy</hi>, yet are not these three distinct formes of Government, but three diverse Titles given by those who were either displeas'd with that
						present Government, or those that bare Rule. For men, by giving names, doe usually, not onely signifie the things <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0166" n="111"/>themselves, but also their own <hi rend="italic"
							>affections</hi>, as <hi rend="italic">love, hatred, anger</hi>, and the like, whence it happens that what one man calls a <hi rend="italic">Democraty</hi>, another
						calls an <hi rend="italic">Anarchy</hi>; what one counts an <hi rend="italic">Aristocraty</hi>, another esteemes an <hi rend="italic">Oligarchie</hi>. and whom one
						titles a <hi rend="italic">King</hi>, another stiles him a <hi rend="italic">Tyrant</hi>; so as we see these names betoken not a <hi rend="italic">diverse kinde</hi> of
						Government, but the <hi rend="italic">diverse opinions</hi> of the Subjects concerning him who hath the Supreme Power. For first, who sees not that <hi rend="italic"
							>Anarchy </hi>is equally opposite to all the forenam'd Formes? For that word signifies that there is no Government at all, that is, not any City. But how is it
						possible that <hi rend="italic">no City</hi> should be the species of <hi rend="italic">a City</hi>? Farthermore, what difference is there between an <hi rend="italic"
							>Oligarchie</hi>, which signifies the Command of a <hi rend="italic">few</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Grandees</hi>, or an <hi rend="italic">Aristocraty</hi>, which is
						that of the <hi rend="italic">Prime, or Chief Heads</hi>, more then that men differ so among themselves, that the same things seeme not good to all men? Whence it
						happens, that those persons, who by some are look'd on as the <hi rend="italic">best</hi>, are by others esteem'd to be the <hi rend="italic">worst </hi>of all men. </p>
					<p> III. But men, by reason of their passions, will very hardly be perswaded that a <hi rend="italic">Kingdome</hi>, and Tyranny, are not diverse kindes of Cities, who
						though they would rather have the City subject <hi rend="italic">to one</hi>, then <hi rend="italic">many</hi>, yet doe they not beleeve it to be well govern'd unlesse
						it accord with their judgements: But we must discover by Reason, and not by Passion, what the difference is between a <hi rend="italic">King</hi>, and a <hi
							rend="italic">Tyrant</hi>: but first, they differ not in this, That a <hi rend="italic">Tyrant </hi>hath <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0167" n="112"/>the <hi rend="italic">greater Power</hi>, for greater then
						the <hi rend="italic">Supreme</hi> cannot be granted; nor in this, That one hath a limited power, the other not; for he, whose authority is limited, is <hi
							rend="italic">no King</hi>, but his <hi rend="italic">Subject </hi>that limits him. Lastly, neither differ they in their manner of acquisition; for if in a <hi
							rend="italic">Democraticall</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Aristocraticall </hi>Government some one Citizen should, by force, possesse himself of the <hi rend="italic"
							>Supreme Power</hi>, if he gain the consent of all the Citizens, he becomes a legitimate <hi rend="italic">Monarch</hi>; if not, he is an <hi rend="italic"
						>Enemy</hi>, not a <hi rend="italic">Tyrant</hi>. They differ therefore in the sole exercise of their command, insomuch as he is said to be a King, who governs wel, and
						he a <hi rend="italic">Tyrant </hi>that doth otherwise. The case therefore is brought to this passe, That a King legitimately constituted in his <hi rend="italic"
							>Government</hi>, if he seeme to his Subjects to Rule well, and to their liking, they afford him the appellation of a King, if not, they count him a <hi rend="italic"
							>Tyrant</hi>. Wherefore we see a <hi rend="italic">Kingdome</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Tyranny</hi>, are not diverse Formes of Government, but one and the self-same
							<hi rend="italic">Monarch </hi>hath the name of a <hi rend="italic">King </hi>given him in point of Honour, and Reverence to him, and of a <hi rend="italic">Tyrant
						</hi>in way of contumely, and reproach. But what we frequently finde in bookes said against <hi rend="italic">Tyrants</hi>, took its originall from Greek, and Roman
						Writers, whose Government was partly <hi rend="italic">Democraticall</hi>, and partly <hi rend="italic">Aristocraticall</hi>, and therefore not <hi rend="italic"
							>Tyrants </hi>onely, but even <hi rend="italic">Kings </hi>were odious to them. </p>
					<p> IV. There are, who indeed doe think it necessary, That a <hi rend="italic">Supreme Command</hi> should be somewhere extant in a, City; <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0168"
						n="113"/> but if it should be in any <hi
							rend="italic">one</hi>, either <hi rend="italic">Man</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Councell</hi>, it would follow (they say) that all the Citizens must be slaves.
						Avoiding this condition, they imagine that there may be a certaine Form of Government <hi rend="italic">compounded </hi>of those three kinds we have spoken of, yet
						different from each particular, which they call a <hi rend="italic">mixt Monarchie</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">mixt Aristocraty</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">mixt
						Democraty</hi>, according as any one of these three sorts shall be more eminent then the rest: For example, if the naming of Magistrates, and the arbitration of War,
						and Peace, should belong to the King, Judicature to the <hi rend="italic">Lords</hi>, and contribution of Monies to the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>, and the power of
						making Lawes too altogether, this kind of State would they call a <hi rend="italic">mixt Monarchie</hi> forsooth. But if it were possible that there could be such a
						State, it would no whit advantage the liberty of the subject; for as long as they all agree, each single Citizen is as much subject as possibly he can be; but if they
						disagree, the State returns to a Civill War, and the Right of the <hi rend="italic">private Sword</hi>, which certainly is much worse then any subjection whatsoever:
						But that there can be no such kind of Government hath been sufficiently demonstrated in the foregoing Chapter, Artic: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. </p>
					<p> But that there can be no such kinde of Government] <hi rend="italic">Most men grant, That a </hi>Government <hi rend="italic">ought not to be divided, but they would
							have it moderated, and bounded by some limits. Truly it is very reasonable it should be so; but if these men, when they speak of moderating, and limiting, do
							understand dividing it, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0169" n="114"/>they make a very fond distinction. Truly, for my part, I wish that not onely</hi> Kings, <hi rend="italic">but all other Persons endued with
							Supreme Authority would so temper themselves as to commit no wrong, and onely minding their charges contain themselves within the limits of the naturall, and divine
							Lawes: But they who distinguish thus, they would have the chief Power bounded, and restrain'd by others; which, because it cannot be done, but that they who doe set
							the limits, must needs have some part of the Power, whereby they may be enabled to doe it, the Government is properly divided, not moderated.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> V. Let us see a little now in the constituting of each Form of Government, what the constitutours doe. Those who met together with intention to erect a City, were
						almost in the very act of meeting a Democraty; for in that they willingly met, they are suppos'd oblig'd to the observation of what shall be determin'd by the major
						part: which, while that convent lasts, or is adjourn'd to some certain dayes, and places, is a clear <hi rend="italic">Democraty</hi>; for that convent, whose will is
						the will of all the Citizens, hath the <hi rend="italic">Supreme Authority</hi>; and because in this Convent every man is suppos'd to have a Right to give his voice, it
						followes, that it is a <hi rend="italic">Democraty </hi>by the definition given in the first Article of this Chap. But if they depart, and break up the Convent, and
						appoint no time, or place, where, and when they shall meet again, the publick weal returns to <hi rend="italic">Anarchy</hi>, and the same state it stood in before
						their meeting, that is, to the state of all men warring against all. <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0170" n="115"/>The <hi rend="italic">People </hi>therefore retains the <hi rend="italic">supreme power</hi> no
						longer then there is a certain day and place publiquely appointed, and known, to which whosoever will, may resort. For except that be known and determined, they may
						either meet at divers times, and places, that is in factions, or not at all; and then it is no longer demos, the People, but a dissolute multitude, to whom we can
						neither attributes any Action, or Right: Two things therefore frame a Democratie, whereof one (to wit the perpetuall prescription of Convents) makes <foreign lang="gre">
							<hi rend="italic">&dgr;&#x1FC6;&mgr;&ogr;&ngr;</hi>
						</foreign>, the People, the other (which is a plurality of voyces) <foreign lang="gre">
							<hi rend="italic"> &tgr;&#x1F78; &kgr;&rgr;&#x1F71;&tgr;&ogr;&sgr; </hi>
						</foreign> or the power. </p>
					<p> VI. Furthermore, it will not be sufficient for the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>, so as to maintain its <hi rend="italic">supremacy</hi>, to have some certain known
						times, and places of meeting, unlesse that either the intervals of the times be of lesse distance, then that any thing may in the mean time happen whereby (by reason of
						the defect of <hi rend="italic">power</hi>) the City may be brought into some danger, or at least that the exercise of the <hi rend="italic">supreme authority</hi> be,
						during the intervall, granted to some <hi rend="italic">one man</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Councell</hi>. For unlesse this be done, there is not that wary care, and
						heed taken for the defence and Peace of single men which ought to be, and therefore will not deserve the name of a City, because that in it for want of security, every
						mans Right of defending himselfe at his own pleasure, returns to him again. </p>
					<p> VII. <hi rend="italic">Democraty </hi>is not framed by contract of particular persons with the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>, but by mutuall compacts of single men
						each with other. But hence it appears in the first place, that the Persons contracting, must be <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0171" n="116"/>in being before the contract it selfe. But the <hi rend="italic">People
						</hi>is not in being before the constitution of government, as not being any Person, but a multitude of single Persons; wherefore there could then no contract passe
						between the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>and <hi rend="italic">the Subject</hi>. Now, if after that government is framed, the subject make any contract with the <hi
							rend="italic">People</hi>, it is in vain, because the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>contains within its will, the will of that subject to whom it is supposed to be
						obliged; and therefore may at its own will and pleasure disengage it selfe, and by consequence is now actually free. But in the second place, that single Persons doe
						contract each with other may be inferred from hence, that in vain sure would the City have been constituted, if the Citizens had been engaged by no contracts to doe, or
						omit what the City should command to be done or omitted. Because therefore such kind of compacts must be understood to passe as necessary to the making up of a City,
						but none can be made (as is already shewed) between the <hi rend="italic">Subject </hi>and the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>; it followes, that they must be made
						between single Citizens, namely that each man contract to submit his will to the will of the major part, on condition that the rest also doe the like, as if every one
						should say thus, I give up my Right unto the People for your sake, on condition, that you also deliver up yours, for mine. </p>
					<p> VIII. An Aristocraty, or <hi rend="italic">Councell </hi>of Nobles endued with <hi rend="italic">supreme authoritie</hi>, receives its originall from a <hi
						rend="italic">Democraty</hi>, which gives up its Right unto it; where we must understand that certain men distinguisht <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0172" n="117"/>from others, either by eminence of title,
						blood, or some other Character, are propounded to the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>, and by plurality of voyces are elected; and being elected, the whole Right of the
							<hi rend="italic">People</hi>, or City, is conveighed on them, insomuch as whatsoever the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>might doe before, the same by Right may this
							<hi rend="italic">Court </hi>of elected <hi rend="italic">Nobles </hi>now doe. Which being done, it is clear that the People, considered as one Person, (its <hi
							rend="italic">supreme authority</hi> being already transferred on these) is no longer now in being. </p>
					<p> IX. As in <hi rend="italic">Democraty </hi>the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>, so in an <hi rend="italic">Aristocraty </hi>the <hi rend="italic">Court </hi>of Nobles
						is free from all manner of obligation; for seeing subjects not contracting with the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>, but by mutuall compacts among themselves, were tyed
						to all that the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>did, hence also they were tyed to that act of the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>in resigning up its Right of government
						into the hands of Nobles. Neither could this <hi rend="italic">Court</hi>, although elected by the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>, be by it obliged to any thing; for
						being erected, the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>is at once dissolved, as was declared above, and the authority it had as being a <hi rend="italic">Person</hi> utterly
						vanisheth. Wherefore the obligation which was due to the <hi rend="italic">Person </hi>must also vanish, and perish together with it. </p>
					<p> X. <hi rend="italic">Aristocraty </hi>hath these considerations, together with <hi rend="italic">Democraty</hi>; First, that without an appointment of some certain
						times, and places, at which the <hi rend="italic">Court </hi>of Nobles may meet, it is no longer a <hi rend="italic">Court</hi>, or one Person, but a dissolute
						multitude without any supreme power; Secondly, that the times of their assembling cannot be disjoyned by long intervalls, without prejudice to the <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0173" n="118"/>supreme power,
						unlesse its administration be transferred to some one man: Now the reasons why this happens, are the same which we set down in the fifth Article. </p>
					<p> XI. As an <hi rend="italic">Aristocratie</hi>, so also a <hi rend="italic">Monarchy </hi>is derived from the Power of the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>, transferring
						its <hi rend="italic">Right</hi>, (that is) its <hi rend="italic">Authoritie </hi>on <hi rend="italic">one man</hi>: Here also we must understand, that some <hi
							rend="italic">one man</hi>, either by name, or some other token, is propounded to be taken notice of above all the rest, and that by a plurality of voyces the whole
						Right of the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>is conveighed on him, insomuch as whatsoever the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>could doe before he were elected, the same in
						every Respect may he by Right now doe, being elected; which being done, the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>is no longer one <hi rend="italic">Person</hi>, but a rude
						multitude, as being only one before by vertue of the <hi rend="italic">supreme command</hi>, whereof they now have made a conveyance from themselves on this one Man. </p>
					<p> XII. And therefore neither doth the <hi rend="italic">Monarch</hi> oblige himselfe to any for the command he receives, for he receives it from the <hi rend="italic"
							>People</hi>; but as hath been shewed above, the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>, as soon as that act is done, ceaseth to be a <hi rend="italic">Person</hi>; but the
							<hi rend="italic">Person</hi> vanishing, all obligation to the <hi rend="italic">Person </hi>vanisheth. The subjects therefore are tyed to perform obedience to the
							<hi rend="italic">Monarch</hi>, by those compacts only by which they mutually obliged themselves to the observation of all that the <hi rend="italic">People
						</hi>should command them, (that is) to obey that <hi rend="italic">Monarch</hi>, if he were made by the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>. </p>
					<p> XIII. But a <hi rend="italic">Monarchy </hi>differs as well from an <hi rend="italic">Aristocraty</hi>, as a Democratie, in this chiefly, that in those there must be
						certain <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0174" n="119"/>set times and places for deliberation, and consultation of affaires, that is, for the actuall exercise of it in all times, and places; For the <hi rend="italic"
							>People</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">Nobles </hi>not being <hi rend="italic">one naturall Person</hi> must necessarily have their meetings. The <hi rend="italic"
							>Monarch</hi> who is one by nature, is alwayes in a present capacity to execute his authority. </p>
					<p> XIV. Because we have declared above in the 7. 9. and 12. Articles, that they who have gotten the <hi rend="italic">supreme command</hi> are by no compacts obliged to
						any man, it necessarily followes, that they can doe no <hi rend="italic">injury </hi>to the subjects; for <hi rend="italic">injury </hi>according to the definition made
						in the third Article of the third Chapter, is nothing else but a breach of contract: and therefore where no contracts have part, there can be no injury. Yet the <hi
							rend="italic">People</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Nobles</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Monarch </hi>may diverse wayes transgresse against the other Lawes of nature,
						as by <hi rend="italic">cruelty, iniquity, contumely</hi>, and other like vices, which come not under this strict, and exact notion of <hi rend="italic">injury</hi>.
						But if the subject yeeld not obedience to the supreme, he will in propriety of speech be said to be <hi rend="italic">injurious</hi> as well to his fellow subjects,
						because each man hath compacted with the other to obey, as to his <hi rend="italic">chief Ruler</hi>, in resuming that Right, which he hath given him, without his
						consent. And in a <hi rend="italic">Democraty</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Aristocraty</hi>, if any thing be decreed against any <hi rend="italic">Law of nature</hi>, the
						City it selfe (i.e.) the civill Person sinnes not, but those subjects only by whose votes it was decreed; for sinne is a consequence of the naturall expresse will, not
						of the politicall, which is artificiall; for if it were otherwise,<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0175" n="120"/>" they would be guilty, by whom the decree was absolutely disliked: But in a <hi rend="italic"
							>Monarchie</hi>, if the <hi rend="italic">Monarch </hi>make any decree against the <hi rend="italic">Lawes of nature</hi>, he sins himselfe, because in him the civill
						will and the naturall are all one. </p>
					<p> XV. The people who are about to make a <hi rend="italic">Monarch</hi>, may give him the <hi rend="italic">supremacy </hi>either simply without limitation of time, or
						for a certaine season; and time determined; if simply, we must understand that he who receives it, hath the selfe-same power which they had, who gave it, on the same
						grounds: therefore that the <hi rend="italic">People by Right</hi> could make <hi rend="italic">him </hi>a <hi rend="italic">Monarch</hi>, may he make <hi rend="italic"
							>another Monarch</hi>: insomuch as the <hi rend="italic">Monarch </hi>to whom the command is simply given, receives a <hi rend="italic">Right </hi>not of <hi
							rend="italic">possession </hi>onely, but of <hi rend="italic">succession </hi>also, so as he may declare whom hee pleaseth for his successor. </p>
					<p> XVI. But if the power be given for a time limited, we must have regard to somewhat more then the bare gift onely: First, whether the <hi rend="italic">People
						</hi>conveighing its authority, left it selfe any <hi rend="italic">Right </hi>to meet at certain times, and places, or not. Next, if it have reserved this power,
						whether it were done, so as they might meet before that time were expired, which they prescribed to the Monarch. Thirdly, whether they were contented to meet onely at
						the will of that temporary <hi rend="italic">Monarch </hi>and not otherwise. Suppose now the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>had delivered up <hi rend="italic">its
						power</hi> to some one man for term of life onely; which being done, let us suppose in the first place, that every man departed from the Counsell without making any
						order at all <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0176" n="121"/>concerning the place where (after his death) they should meet again to make a new election. In this case it is manifest by the fifth Article of this
						Chapter, that the <hi rend="italic">People</hi> ceaseth to be a <hi rend="italic">Person</hi>, and is become a dissolute multitude, every one whereof hath an equall, to
						wit, a naturall Right to meet with whom he lists at divers times, and in what places shall best please him; nay, and if he can, engrosse the supreme power to himselfe,
						and settle it on his own head. What <hi rend="italic">Monarch </hi>soever therefore hath a command in such a condition, he is bound by the <hi rend="italic">Law of
							nature</hi> (set down in the Article of the third Chapter <hi rend="italic">of not returning evill for good</hi>) prudently to provide, that by his death the City
						suffer not a dissolution, either by appointing a certain day, &amp; place, in which those subjects of his who have a mind to it may assemble themselves, or else by
						nominating a successor: whether of these shall to him seem most conducible to their common benefit. He therefore who on this foresaid manner hath received <hi
							rend="italic">his command</hi> during life, hath an <hi rend="italic">absolute power</hi>, and may at his discretion dispose of the succession. In the next place, if
						we grant that the <hi rend="italic">people </hi>departed not from the election of the <hi rend="italic">temporary Monarch</hi>, before they decreed a certain time and
						place of meeting after his death, then the <hi rend="italic">Monarch </hi>being dead, the authority is confirmed in the <hi rend="italic">people</hi>, not by any new
						acts of the subjects, but by vertue of the former Right; for all the <hi rend="italic">supreme command</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">Dominion</hi>) was in the <hi
							rend="italic">People</hi>, but the <hi rend="italic">use</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">exercise </hi>of it was only in the <hi rend="italic">temporary Monarch</hi>, as
						in one <hi rend="italic">that takes the benefit</hi>, but hath not <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0177" n="122"/>the Right. But if the <hi rend="italic">People</hi> after the election of a <hi rend="italic"
							>temporarie Monarch</hi>, depart not from the Court before they have appointed certain times, and places to convene, during the time prescribed him (as the <hi
							rend="italic">Dictators </hi>in ancient times were made by the People of <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>) such an one is not to be accounted a <hi rend="italic"
						>Monarch</hi>, but the Prime Officer of the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>; and if it shall seem good, the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>may deprive him of his office
						even before that time, as the <hi rend="italic">People of Rome</hi> did, when they conferred an equall power on <hi rend="italic">Minutius </hi>Master of the horse,
						with <hi rend="italic">Quintus Fabius Maximus</hi>, whom before they had made <hi rend="italic">Dictator</hi>. The reason whereof is, hat it is not to be imagined,
						that, whether Man or Counsell who hath the readiest, and most immediate power to act, should hold his command on such termes as not to be able actually to execute it;
						for command is nothing else but a Right of commanding, as oft as nature allowes it possible. Lastly, if the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>having declared a <hi
							rend="italic">temporary Monarch</hi>, depart from the Court on such termes, as it shall not be lawfull for them to meet without the command of the <hi rend="italic"
							>Monarch</hi>, we must understand the People to be immediately dissolved, and that his authority who is thus declared, is absolute; forasmuch as it is not in the
						power of all the subjects to frame the City anew, unlesse he give consent who hath now alone the authority. Nor matters it, that he hath perhaps made any promise to
						assemble his Subjects on some certain times, since there remains no <hi rend="italic">Person </hi>now in being, but at his discretion, to whom the promise was made.
						What we have spoken of these <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0178" n="123"/>four cases of a <hi rend="italic">People </hi>electing a <hi rend="italic">Temporary Monarch</hi> will be more clearly explain'd by
						comparing them with an <hi rend="italic">absolute Monarch</hi>, who hath no heir apparent; for the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>is <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>of the
						subject in such a manner as there can be no Heir but whom it self doth appoint. Besides, the spaces between the times of the subjects meeting may be fitly compar'd to
						those times wherein the <hi rend="italic">Monarch </hi>sleepes, for in either the <hi rend="italic">Acts </hi>of commanding ceases, the <hi rend="italic">Power
						</hi>remaines: Farthermore, to dissolve the convent, so as it cannot meet againe, is the death of the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>; just as sleeping, so as he can
						never wake more, is the death of a man: As therefore a King, who hath no Heir, going to his rest, so as never to rise again, (i.e.) dying, if he commit the exercise of
						his Regall Authority to any one till he awake, does by consequence give him the Succession; the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>also <hi rend="italic">electing a
							Temporary Monarch</hi>, and not reserving a power to convene, delivers up to him the whole Dominion of the Country: Furthermore, as a King going to sleep for some
						season, entrusts the administration of his Kingdome to some other, and waking takes it again; so the people having elected a <hi rend="italic">Temporary Monarch</hi>,
						and withall retaining a right to meet at a certain day, and place, at that day receives its supremacy again. And as a King who hath committed the execution of his
						Authority to another, himself in the mean while waking, can recall this commission againe when he pleaseth; so the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>, who during the time
						prescribed to the <hi rend="italic">Temporary Monarch</hi>, doth by Right convene, may if they <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0179" n="124"/>please, deprive the Monarch of his Authority. Lastly, the King, who
						commits his Authority to another while himself sleeps, not being able to wake againe till he whom he entrusted, give consent, loses at once both his power, and his
						life; so the people, who hath given the Supreme Power to a temporary Monarch in such sort as they cannot assemble without his command is absolutely dissolv'd, and the
						power remaines with him whom they have chosen. </p>
					<p> XVII. If the <hi rend="italic">Monarch promise</hi> ought to any one, or many subjects together, by consequence whereof the exercise of his power may suffer
						prejudice, that <hi rend="italic">Promise </hi>or <hi rend="italic">Compact </hi>whether made by Oath, or without it, is null: for all <hi rend="italic">Compact </hi>is
						a conveyance of Right, which by what hath been said in the fourth Article of the second Chapter, requires meet, and proper signes of the Will in the conveyer. But he
						who sufficiently signifies his will of retaining the end, doth also sufficiently declare that he quits not his Right to the means necessary to that end. Now he who hath
						promis'd to part with somewhat necessary to the <hi rend="italic">Supreme Power</hi>, and yet retaines the <hi rend="italic">Power </hi>it selfe, gives sufficient
						tokens, That he no otherwise promis'd it then so farre forth as the power might be retain'd without it. Whensoever therefore it shall appear that what is promis'd
						cannot be perform'd <hi rend="italic">without prejudice to the Power</hi>, the promise must be valued as not made, (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>) of no effect. </p>
					<p> XVIII. We have seen how Subjects, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0180" n="125"/>nature dictating, have oblig'd themselves by mutuall Compacts to obey the <hi rend="italic">Supreme Power</hi>. We will see now by
						what meanes it comes to passe that they are releas'd from these bonds of obedience. And first of all this happens by <hi rend="italic">rejection</hi>, namely, if a man
						cast off, <hi rend="italic">or </hi>forsake, but conveigh not the <hi rend="italic">Right of his Command</hi> on some other; for what is thus rejected, is openly
						expos'd to all alike, catch who catch can; whence again, by the Right of nature, every subject may heed the preservation of himselfe according to his own judgement. In
						the second place, If the Kingdome fall into the power of the enemy, so as there can no more opposition be made against them, we must understand that he, who before had
						the <hi rend="italic">Supreme Authority</hi>, hath now lost it: For when the Subjects have done their full indeavour to prevent their falling into the enemies hands,
						they have fulfill'd those Contracts of obedience which they made each with other, and what, being conquer'd, they promise afterwards, to avoid death, they must, with no
						lesse endeavour, labour to performe. Thirdly, in a <hi rend="italic">Monarchy</hi>, (for a <hi rend="italic">Democraty</hi>, and Aristocraty cannot fail) if there be no
						successour, all the subjects are discharg'd from their obligations; for no man is suppos'd to be tyed he knows not to whom, for in such a case it were impossible to
						perform ought. And by these three wayes all subjects are restor'd from their civill subjection to that liberty, which all men have to all things, to wit, naturall, and
						salvage, (for the naturall state hath the same proportion to the Civill, I mean <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0181" n="126"/>liberty to subjection, which Passion hath to Reason, or a Beast to a Man:) Furthermore,
						each subject may lawfully be freed from his subjection by the will of him who hath the Supreme Power, namely, if he change his soile, which may be done two wayes,
						either by permission, as he, who gets license to dwell in another Country; or Command, as he, who is <hi rend="italic">Banisht</hi>: In both cases he is free from the
						Lawes of his former Country, because he is tyed to observe those of the latter.</p>

					<p>IX.  By what means Servants are freed.</p>
					<p>X.  Dominion over Beasts belongs to the Rights of nature.</p>
					<lb/>
					<p> I. In the two fore-going Chapters we have treated of an institutive, or <hi rend="italic">fram'd Government</hi>, as being that which receives its originall from the
						consent of many, who by Contract and Faith mutually given, have oblig'd each other. Now followes, what may be said, concerning a <hi rend="italic">naturall
						Government</hi>, which may also be call'd, <hi rend="italic">Acquired</hi>, because it is that which is gotten by power, and naturall force. But we must know in the
						first place by what means the Right of Dominion may be gotten over the <hi rend="italic">Persons </hi>of men. Where such a Right is gotten, there is a kind of a <hi
							rend="italic">little Kingdome</hi>; for to be a <hi rend="italic">King</hi>, is nothing else but to have <hi rend="italic">Dominion</hi> over many <hi rend="italic"
							>Persons</hi>; and thus a <hi rend="italic">Great Family</hi> is a <hi rend="italic">Kingdom</hi>, &amp; a <hi rend="italic">Little Kingdome</hi> a <hi
							rend="italic">Family</hi>. Let us return again to the state of nature, and consider men as if but even now sprung out of the earth, and suddainly (<hi rend="italic"
							>like </hi>Mushromes) come to full maturity without all kind of engagement to each other: There are but three wayes only whereby one can have the <hi rend="italic"
								>Dominion </hi>over the <hi rend="italic">Person </hi>of another; whereof the first is, if by mutuall Contract made between <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0183" n="128"/>themselves (for Peace, &amp;
						self-defences sake) they have willingly given up themselves to the <hi rend="italic">Power </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Authority </hi>of some man, or Councel of Men,
						&amp; of this we have already spoken. The 2d is, If a man taken Prisoner in the Wars, or overcome; or else distrusting his own forces, (to avoid Death) promises the
						Conquerour, or the stronger Party, <hi rend="italic">his Service</hi>, i.e. to do all whatsoever he shall command him; in which Contract the good which the vanquisht,
						or inferiour, in strength doth receive, is the grant of his life, which by the Right of War in the naturall state of men he might have depriv'd him of, but the good
						which he promises, is his service and obedience. By vertue therefore of this promise, there is as absolute service and obedience due from the vanquisht, to the
						vanquisher, as possibly can be, excepting what repugns the Divine Lawes; for he who is oblig'd to obey the Commands of any man before he knowes what he will command
						him, is simply, and without any restriction tyed to the performance of all Commands whatsoever. Now he that is thus tyed, is call'd a <hi rend="italic">SERVANT</hi>, he
						to whom he is tyed, a <hi rend="italic">LORD</hi>. Thirdly, there is a Right acquir'd over the Person of a Man, by Generation; of which kind of acquisition somewhat
						shall be spoken in the following Chapter. </p>
					<p> II. Every one that is taken in the War, and hath his life spar'd him, is not suppos'd to have Contracted with his <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi>; for every one is not
						trusted with so much of his naturall liberty, as to be able, if he desir'd it, either to flie away, or quit his service, or <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0184" n="129"/>contrive any mischief to his <hi
							rend="italic">Lord</hi>. And these serve indeed but within Prisons, or bound within Irons, and therefore they were call'd not by the common name of <hi rend="italic"
							>Servant </hi>onely, but by the peculiar name of <hi rend="italic">Slave</hi>, even as now at this day <hi rend="italic">un serviteur</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">un
							serf</hi> or <hi rend="italic">un esclave</hi> have diverse significations. </p>
					<p> III. The obligation therefore of a <hi rend="italic">Servant </hi>to his <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi> ariseth not from a simple grant of his life, but from hence
						rather, That he keeps him not bound, or imprison'd, for all obligation derives from Contract; but where's no trust, there can be no Contract, as appears by the 2. Chap.
						Artic. 9. where a Compact is defin'd to be the promise of him who is trusted. There is therefore a confidence and trust which accompanies the benefit of pardon'd life,
						whereby the <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>affords him his corporall liberty. so that if no obligation, nor bonds of Contract had happen'd, he might not onely have made
						his escape, but also have kill'd his <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi>, who was the preserver of his life. </p>
					<p> IV. Wherefore such kind of <hi rend="italic">Servants </hi>as are restrain'd by imprisonment, or bonds, are not comprehended in that definition of <hi rend="italic"
							>Servants </hi>given above, because those serve not for the Contracts sake, but to the end they may not suffer; and therefore if they flie, or kill their <hi
							rend="italic">Lord</hi>, they offend not against the Lawes of Nature, for to bind any man is a plain signe, that the binder supposes him that is bound not to be
						sufficiently tyed by any other obligation. </p>
					<p> V. The <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>therefore hath no less Dominion over a Servant that <hi rend="italic">is not</hi>, then over one <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0185"
						n="130"/>that <hi rend="italic">is
						bound</hi>, for he hath a <hi rend="italic">Supreme Power</hi> over both, and may say of his <hi rend="italic">Servant </hi>no lesse then of another thing, whether
						animate, or inanimate, This is mine; whence it followes, that whatsoever the <hi rend="italic">Servant </hi>had before his servitude, that afterwards becomes the <hi
							rend="italic">Lords</hi>; and whatsoever he hath gotten, it was gotten for his <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi>: for he that can by Right dispose of the <hi rend="italic"
							>Person </hi>of a man, may surely dispose of all those things which that <hi rend="italic">Person </hi>could dispose of. There is therefore nothing which the Servant
						may retaine as <hi rend="italic">his own</hi> against the will of his <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi>; yet hath he, by his <hi rend="italic">Lords </hi>distribution, a <hi
							rend="italic">propriety</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Dominion </hi>over <hi rend="italic">his own goods</hi>, insomuch as one <hi rend="italic">Servant </hi>may keep,
						and defend them against the invasion of <hi rend="italic">his fellow Servant</hi>, in the same manner as hath been shewed before, that a subject hath nothing properly
							<hi rend="italic">his owne</hi> against the will of the <hi rend="italic">Supreme Authority</hi>, but every subject hath a propriety against <hi rend="italic">his
						</hi>fellow subject. </p>
					<p> VI. Since therefore both the <hi rend="italic">Servant </hi>himself, and all that belongs to him are his <hi rend="italic">Lords</hi>, and by the Right of Nature
						every man may dispose of his owne in what manner he pleases; the <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi> may either sell, lay to pledge, or by Testament conveigh the Dominion he
						hath over his <hi rend="italic">Servant</hi>, according to his own will and pleasure. </p>
					<p> VII. Farthermore, what hath before been demonstrated concerning subjects in an <hi rend="italic">institutive Government</hi>, namely, that he who hath the Supreme
						Power can doe his subject no <hi rend="italic">injury</hi>; is true also concerning <hi rend="italic">Servants</hi>, because they have subjected their <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0186" n="131"/>will to the will
						of the <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi>; wherefore, whatsoever he doth, it is done with their wills, but no injury can be done to him that willeth it. </p>
					<p> VIII. But if it happen that the <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi>, either by captivity or voluntary subjection, doth become a <hi rend="italic">Servant </hi>or <hi
							rend="italic">Subject </hi>to another, that other shall not onely be Lord of him, but also of his <hi rend="italic">Servants</hi>; <hi rend="italic">Supreme Lord</hi>
						over these, <hi rend="italic">immediate Lord</hi> over him. Now because not the <hi rend="italic">Servant </hi>only, but also all he hath are his <hi rend="italic"
							>Lords</hi>; therefore his <hi rend="italic">Servants </hi>now belong to this man, neither can the mediate <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>dispose otherwise of them then
						shall seeme good to the <hi rend="italic">Supreme</hi>. And therefore, if sometime in civill Governments, the <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>have an absolute power over
						his <hi rend="italic">Servants</hi>, that's suppos'd to be deriv'd from the Right of Nature, and not constituted, but slightly pass'd over by the Civill Law. </p>
					<p> IX. A <hi rend="italic">servant </hi>is by the same manner freed from his <hi rend="italic">servitude</hi>, that a <hi rend="italic">Subject </hi>in an <hi
							rend="italic">institutive government</hi>, is freed from his subjection; First, if his <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>enfranchize him, for the Right which the servant
						transferred to his Lord over himselfe, the same may the <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>restore to the <hi rend="italic">servant </hi>again. And this manner of bestowing of
						liberty is called <hi rend="italic">MANUMISSION</hi>; which is just as if a City should permit a Citizen to conveigh himselfe under the jurisdiction of some other City.
						Secondly, if the <hi rend="italic">Lord cast off</hi> his <hi rend="italic">servant </hi>from him, which in a City is <hi rend="italic">banishment</hi>; neither differs
						it from <hi rend="italic">Manumission </hi>in effect, but in manner onely: for there, liberty is granted <hi rend="italic">as a favour</hi>, here, <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0187" n="132"/>as a punishment: In
						both, the <hi rend="italic">Dominion </hi>is renounced. Thirdly, if the servant be taken prisoner, the <hi rend="italic">old </hi>servitude is abolished by the <hi
							rend="italic">new</hi>; for as all other things, so servants also are acquired by warre, whom in equity the <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>must protect, if he will have
						them to be his. Fourthly, the <hi rend="italic">servant </hi>is freed for want of knowledge of a successour, the <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>dying (suppose) without any
						Testament, or Heire, for no man is understood to be obliged, unlesse he know to whom he is to perform the obligation. Lastly, the <hi rend="italic">servant </hi>that is
						put in bonds, or by any other means deprived of his corporall liberty, is freed from that other obligation of contract, for there can be no contract where there is no
						trust, nor can that faith be broken which is not given. But the <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>who himselfe serves another, cannot so free his <hi rend="italic"
						>servants</hi>, but that they must still continue under the power of the <hi rend="italic">supreme</hi>, for, as hath been shewed before, such <hi rend="italic"
							>servants </hi>are not his, but the <hi rend="italic">supreme Lords</hi>. </p>
					<p> X. We get a right over irrationall Creatures in the same manner, that we doe over the <hi rend="italic">Persons </hi>of men, to wit, by force and naturall strength;
						for if in the state of nature it is lawfull for every one, by reason of that warre which is of all against all, to subdue, and also to kill men as oft as it shall seem
						to conduce unto their good, much more will the same be lawfull against Brutes; namely at their own discretion, to reduce those to servitude which by art may be tamed,
						and fitted for use, and to persecute and destroy the rest by a perpetuall warre, as dangerous and noxious. Our <hi rend="italic">Dominion </hi>therefore over <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0188" n="133"/>beasts,
						hath its originall from the <hi rend="italic">right of nature</hi>, not from <hi rend="italic">divine positive Right</hi>: for if such a Right had not been before the
						publishing of the sacred Scriptures, no man by right might have killed a beast for his food, but he to whom the divine pleasure was made manifest by holy Writ; a most
						hard condition for men indeed whom the beasts might devoure without injury, and yet they might not destroy them: Forasmuch therefore as it proceeds from the right of
						nature, that a beast may kill a man; it is also by the same Right, that a man may slay a beast.</p>

					<p> I. <hi rend="italic">Socrates </hi>is a <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, and therefore a living creature, is a right reasoning, and that most evident, because there is
						nothing needfull to the acknowledging of the truth of the consequence, but that the word <hi rend="italic">Man </hi>be understood, because a <hi rend="italic">living
							creature</hi> is in the definition it selfe of a <hi rend="italic">Man</hi>, and every one makes up the proposition which was desired, namely this, <hi rend="italic"
							>Man is a living Creature</hi>; And this, <hi rend="italic">Sophroniscus </hi>is <hi rend="italic">Socrates </hi>his Father, <hi rend="italic">and therefore his
						Lord</hi>, is perhaps a true inference, but not evident, because the word <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>is not in the definition of a <hi rend="italic">Father</hi>:
						wherefore it is necessary to make it more evident, that the connexion of <hi rend="italic">Father </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>be somewhat unfolded. Those that
						have hitherto endeavoured to prove the Dominion of a <hi rend="italic">Parent </hi>over his <hi rend="italic">children</hi>, have brought no other argument then that of
							<hi rend="italic">generation</hi>, as if it were of it selfe evident, that what is begotten by me, is mine; just as if a man should think, that because there is a
						triangle, it appeares presently without any farther discourse, that its angles are equall to two Rights. Besides, since <hi rend="italic">Dominion </hi>(that is) <hi
							rend="italic">supreme power</hi> is indivisible, insomuch as no man can serve two Masters, but two Persons <hi rend="italic">male and female</hi>, must concurre in
						the act of generation, its impossible that <hi rend="italic">Dominion </hi>should at all be acquired by generation onely. Wherefore we will with the more diligence in
						this place, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0191" n="136"/>enquire into the original of <hi rend="italic">paternal Government</hi>. </p>
					<p> II. Wee must therefore returne to the state of nature, in which, by reason of the equality of nature all men of riper yeares are to be accounted equall; There <hi
							rend="italic">by right of nature</hi> the Conqueror is <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>of the conquered: <hi rend="italic">by the Right</hi> therefore of <hi
							rend="italic">nature</hi>, the Dominion over the <hi rend="italic">Infant </hi>first belongs to him who first hath him in his power'd but it's manifest that <hi
							rend="italic">he </hi>who is newly <hi rend="italic">born </hi>is in the <hi rend="italic">Mothers </hi>power before any others, insomuch as she may rightly, and at
						her own wil, either breed him up, or adventure him to fortune. </p>
					<p> III. If therefore she breed him (because the state of nature is the state of warre) she is supposed to bring him up on this condition, that being grown to full age he
						become not her enemy; (which is) that he obey her. For since by naturall necessity we all <hi rend="italic">desire </hi>that which appears good unto us, it cannot be
						understood that any man hath on such termes afforded life to another, that he might both get strength by his years, and at once become an enemy; but each man is an
						enemy to that other whom he neither obeys nor commands. And thus in the state of nature, every woman that bears children, becomes both a <hi rend="italic">Mother</hi>,
						and a <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi>. But what some say, that in this case, the <hi rend="italic">Father </hi>by reason of the preeminence of sexe, and not the <hi
							rend="italic">Mother</hi>, becomes <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi>, signifies nothing. For both reason shewes the contrary, because the inequality of their naturall
						forces is not so great, that the <hi rend="italic">man </hi>could get the Dominion over the <hi rend="italic">woman </hi>without warre. And custome also contradicts
						not; for <hi rend="italic">women</hi>, namely <hi rend="italic">Amazons</hi>, have in former times <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0192" n="137"/>waged war against their adversaries, and disposed of their <hi
							rend="italic">children </hi>at their own wils, and at this day in divers places, <hi rend="italic">women </hi>are invested with the <hi rend="italic">principall
							authority</hi>. Neither doe their husbands dispose of their <hi rend="italic">children</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">themselves</hi>; which in truth they do <hi
							rend="italic">by the right of nature</hi>; forasmuch as they who have the supreme power, are not tyed at all (as hath bin shewed) to the civill lawes. Adde also that
						in the state of nature it cannot be known who is the <hi rend="italic">Father </hi>but by the testimony of the <hi rend="italic">Mother</hi>; the child therefore is his
						whose <hi rend="italic">the Mother</hi> will have it, and therefore <hi rend="italic">hers</hi>; Wherefore originall Dominion over <hi rend="italic">children
						</hi>belongs to the <hi rend="italic">Mother</hi>, and among men no lesse then other creatures: The birth followes the belly. </p>
					<p> IV. The <hi rend="italic">Dominion </hi>passes from the <hi rend="italic">Mother </hi>to others, divers wayes; first, if she quit and forsake her Right by <hi
							rend="italic">exposing the child</hi>. He therefore that shall bring up the childe thus exposed, shall have the same Dominion over it, which the <hi rend="italic"
							>Mother </hi>had. For that life which the <hi rend="italic">Mother </hi>had given it (not<hi rend="italic"> by getting</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">nourishing it</hi>)
						she now <hi rend="italic">by exposing</hi>, takes from it; Wherefore the obligation also which arose from the benefit of life, is by this exposition made voyd. Now the
						preserved, oweth all to the preserver, whether in regard of his education as to a <hi rend="italic">Mother</hi>, or of his <hi rend="italic">service</hi>, as to a <hi
							rend="italic">Lord</hi>; for although the <hi rend="italic">Mother </hi>in the state of nature, where all men have a right to all things, may recover her sonne again
						(namely by the same Right that any body else might doe it) yet may not the <hi rend="italic">Sonne </hi>rightly transferre himselfe again unto his Mother. <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0193" n="138"/></p>
					<p> V. Secondly, if the <hi rend="italic">Mother </hi>be taken prisoner, her <hi rend="italic">Sonne </hi>is his that took her, because that he who hath <hi rend="italic"
							>Dominion </hi>over the <hi rend="italic">Person</hi>, hath also <hi rend="italic">Dominion </hi>over all belonging to the Person; Wherefore over the <hi
							rend="italic">Sonne </hi>also, as hath been shewed in the foregoing Chapter, in the fifth Article. Thirdly, if the Mother be a subject under what government soever,
						he that hath the supreme authority in that government, will also have the <hi rend="italic">Dominion</hi> over him that is born of her. for he is Lord also of the <hi
							rend="italic">Mother</hi>, who is bound to obey him, in all things. Fourthly, if <hi rend="italic">a woman</hi> for societie sake give her selfe to a man on this
						condition; that he shall bear the sway; he that <hi rend="italic">receives his being</hi> from the contribution of both Parties, is the <hi rend="italic">Fathers</hi>,
						in regard of the command he hath over the <hi rend="italic">Mother</hi>; but if a <hi rend="italic">woman bearing rule</hi> shall have <hi rend="italic">children
						</hi>by a <hi rend="italic">Subject</hi>, the children are the <hi rend="italic">Mothers</hi>: for otherwise the woman can have no children without prejudice to her
						authority. And universally, if the society of the <hi rend="italic">male </hi>and <hi rend="italic">female </hi>be such an union, as the one have subjected himselfe to
						the other, the <hi rend="italic">children </hi>belong to him or her <hi rend="italic">that commands</hi>. </p>
					<p> VI. But in the state of nature, if a <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">woman </hi>contract so, as neither is subject to the command of the other, the
						children are the <hi rend="italic">Mothers </hi>for the reasons above given in the third Article, unlesse by pacts it be otherwise provided. For the <hi rend="italic"
							>Mother </hi>may by pact dispose of her Right as she lists, as heretofore hath been done by the Amazons, who of those children which have been begotten by their
						neighbours, have by pact allowed them the <hi rend="italic">males</hi>, and retained the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0194" n="139"/><hi rend="italic">females </hi>to themselves; but in a civill government, if
						there be a contract of marriage between a <hi rend="italic">man </hi>and <hi rend="italic">woman</hi>, the children are the <hi rend="italic">Fathers</hi>; because in
						all Cities, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. constituted of <hi rend="italic">Fathers</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">Mothers </hi>governing their <hi rend="italic"
						>families</hi>, the domesticall command belongs to the man, and such a contract, if it be made according to the civill Laws, is called <hi rend="italic">MATRIMONY</hi>;
						but if they agree only to lye together, the <hi rend="italic">children </hi>are the <hi rend="italic">Fathers</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">Mothers </hi>variously,
						according to the differing civill Lawes of divers Cities. </p>
					<p> VII. Now because by the third Article the <hi rend="italic">Mother is originally Lord of her Children</hi>, and from her the <hi rend="italic">Father</hi>, or some
						body else by derived Right, it is manifest that the <hi rend="italic">Children </hi>are no lesse subject to those by whom they are nourisht, and brought up, then <hi
							rend="italic">Servants </hi>to their <hi rend="italic">Lords</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Subjects </hi>to him who beares the <hi rend="italic">Supreme Rule</hi>; and
						that a <hi rend="italic">Parent </hi>cannot be injurious to his <hi rend="italic">Sonne </hi>as long as he is under his power. A <hi rend="italic">Son </hi>also is
						freed from subjection on the same manner as a <hi rend="italic">subject </hi>and <hi rend="italic">servant </hi>are. For <hi rend="italic">emancipation </hi>is the same
						thing with <hi rend="italic">manumission</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">abdication</hi> with <hi rend="italic">banishment</hi>. </p>
					<p> VIII. The <hi rend="italic">enfranchised son</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">released servant</hi>, doe now stand in lesse fear of their <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>and
							<hi rend="italic">Father</hi>, being deprived of his naturall and lordly power over them, and (if regard be had to true and inward <hi rend="italic">Honour</hi>) doe
							<hi rend="italic">Honour </hi>him lesse, then before. For <hi rend="italic">Honour </hi>(as hath been said in the section above) is nothing else but the estimation of
						anothers power; and therefore he that hath least <hi rend="italic">power</hi>, hath alwayes least <hi rend="italic">Honour</hi>. But it is not to be imagin'd that the
						<hi rend="italic">enfranchiser</hi><pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0195" n="140"/>" ever intended so to match the <hi rend="italic">enfranchised </hi>with himself, as that he should not so much as acknowledge a
						benefit, but should so carry himself in all things, as if he were become wholly his equall; It must therefore be ever understood, That he who is freed from subjection,
						whether he be a <hi rend="italic">servant</hi>, <hi rend="italic">sonne</hi>, or some <hi rend="italic">colony</hi>, doth promise all those externall signes, at least
						whereby Superiours used to be <hi rend="italic">Honour</hi>'d by their inferiours. From whence it followes, That the precept of <hi rend="italic">honouring </hi>our <hi
							rend="italic">Parents</hi>, belongs to the <hi rend="italic">law of nature</hi>, not onely under the title of <hi rend="italic">Gratitude</hi>, but also of <hi
							rend="italic">Agreement</hi>. </p>
					<p> IX. What then, will some one demand, is the difference between a <hi rend="italic">sonne</hi>, or between a <hi rend="italic">subject</hi>, and a <hi rend="italic"
							>servant</hi>? Neither doe I know that any Writer hath fully declared what <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi>, and what <hi rend="italic">slavery </hi>is. Commonly to doe
						all things according to our own phancies, and that without punishment, is esteem'd to be <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi>; not to be able to doe this, is judg'd <hi
							rend="italic">bondage</hi>; which in a Civill Government, and with the peace of mankind cannot possibly be done, because there is no City without a Command, and a
						restraining Right. LIBERTY, that we may define it, is nothing else but an <hi rend="italic">absence of the lets, and hinderances of motion</hi>, as water shut up in a
						vessell is therefore not at liberty, because the vessell hinders it from running out, which the vessell being broken, is <hi rend="italic">made free</hi>. And every man
						hath more or lesse <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi>, as he hath more or lesse space in which he employes himself: as he hath more <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi>, who is
						in a large, then he that is kept in a close prison. And a man may <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0196" n="141"/>be <hi rend="italic">free </hi>toward one part, and yet not toward another; as the traveller is
						bounded on this, and that side with hedges, or stone walls, lest he spoyle the vines, or corne, neighbouring on the high way. And these kinde of lets are externall, and
						absolute; in which sense all <hi rend="italic">Servants</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Subjects </hi>are <hi rend="italic">free</hi>, who are not fetter'd and imprisoned.
						There are others which are arbitrary, which doe not absolutely hinder motion, but by accident; to wit, by our own choyce, as he that is in a ship is not so hindered,
						but he may cast himselfe into the Sea, if he will: and here also the more wayes a man may move himselfe, the more <hi rend="italic">liberty </hi>he hath, and herein
						consists civill <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi>; for no man, whether <hi rend="italic">subject</hi>, <hi rend="italic">sonne</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">servant</hi>, is
						so hindred by the punishments appointed by the <hi rend="italic">City</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Father</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi>, how cruell soever,
						but that he may doe all things, and make use of all meanes necessary to the preservation of his life and health. For my part therefore I cannot finde what reason a meer
							<hi rend="italic">servant </hi>hath to make complaints, if they relate onely to want of <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi>, unlesse he count it a misery to be restrained
						from hurting himselfe, and to receive that life, (which by warre, or misfortune, or through his own idlenesse was forfeited) together with all manner of sustenance, and
						all things necessary to the conservation of health, on this condition only, that he will be rul'd: for he that is kept in by punishments layd before him, so as he dares
						not let loose the reines to his will in all things; is not opprest by <hi rend="italic">servitude</hi>, but is governed and sustained. But this priviledge <hi
							rend="italic">free subjects</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sonnes </hi>of a family,<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0197" n="142"/> have above <hi rend="italic">servants</hi>, (in every government, and family, where
						servants are) that they may both undergoe the more honourable offices of the City or family, and also enjoy a larger possession of things superfluous. And herein layes
						the difference between a <hi rend="italic">free subject</hi>, and a <hi rend="italic">servant</hi>, that he is <hi rend="italic">FREE</hi>, but a <hi rend="italic"
							>SERVANT </hi>is he who also indeed, who serves his City onely; serves his fellow subject: all other liberty is an exemption from the Lawes of the City, and proper
						only to those that bear Rule. </p>
					<p> X. A <hi rend="italic">Father</hi>, with his <hi rend="italic">sonnes </hi>and <hi rend="italic">servants </hi>growne into a civill Person by vertue of his paternall
						jurisdiction, is called a <hi rend="italic">FAMILY</hi>. This <hi rend="italic">family</hi>, if through multiplying of <hi rend="italic">children</hi>, and acquisition
						of <hi rend="italic">servants</hi>, it becomes numerous, insomuch as without casting the uncertain dye of warre, it cannot be subdued, will be termed an <hi
							rend="italic">Hereditary Kingdome</hi>; which though it differ from an <hi rend="italic">institutive Monarchy</hi>, being acquired by force in the original, &amp;
						manner of its constitution; yet being constituted, it hath al the same properties, and the Right of authority is every where the same, insomuch as it is not needfull to
						speak any thing of them apart. </p>
					<p> XI. It hath been spoken, by what Right supreme authorities are constituted. Wee must now briefly tell you by what right they may be continued. Now the Right by which
						they are continued, is that which is called the right of <hi rend="italic">SUCCESSION</hi>. Now because in a <hi rend="italic">Democratie</hi>, the supreme authority is
						with the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>, as long as there be any subjects in being, so long it rests with the same Person; for the People hath no <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0198" n="143"/><hi rend="italic"
							>Successour</hi>. In like manner in an <hi rend="italic">Aristocraty</hi>, one of the Nobles dying, some other by the rest is substituted in his place; and therefore
						except they all dye together, which I suppose will never happen, there is no <hi rend="italic">succession</hi>. The Querie therefore of the Right of <hi rend="italic"
							>Succession </hi>takes place onely in an <hi rend="italic">absolute Monarchy</hi>. For they who exercise the supreme power for a time onely, are themselves no <hi
							rend="italic">Monarchs</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">Ministers </hi>of state. </p>
					<p> XII. But first, if a <hi rend="italic">Monarch </hi>shall by Testament appoint one to <hi rend="italic">succeed </hi>him, the Person appointed shall <hi rend="italic"
							>succeed</hi>; for if he be appointed by the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>, he shall have all the Right over the City which the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>had, as
						hath been shewed in the 7. Chap. Art. 11. But the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>might choose him; by the same Right therefore may he choose another; But in an <hi
							rend="italic">hereditary Kingdome</hi> there are the same Rights as in an <hi rend="italic">institutive</hi>; Wherefore, every Monarch may by his will make a <hi
							rend="italic">successour</hi>. </p>
					<p> XIII. But what a man may transferre on another by Testament, that by the same Right may he yet living, give, or sell away; To whomsoever therefore he shall make over
						the supreme power, whether by gift, or sale, it is rightly made. </p>
					<p> XIV. But if living, he have not declared his will concerning his <hi rend="italic">successour </hi>by Testament, nor otherwise, it is supposed, First, that he would
						not have his Government reduced to an Anarchy, or the state of warre, (that is) to the destruction of his subjects; as well because he could not doe that without breach
						of the Lawes of nature, whereby he was obliged to the performance of all <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0199" n="144"/>things necessarily conducing to the preservation of Peace, as also because if that had been his
						will, it had not been hard for him to have declared that openly. Next, because the Right passeth according to the will of the Father, we must judge of the <hi
							rend="italic">successour </hi>according to the signes of his will. It is understood therefore, that he would have his subjects to be under a <hi rend="italic"
							>Monarchicall </hi>Government rather then any other, because he himselfe in ruling, hath before approved of that state by his example, and hath not afterward either
						by any word or deed condemned it. </p>
					<p> XV. Furthermore, because by naturall necessity all men wish them better from whom they receive glory, and honour, then others; but every man after death receives
						honour and glory from his children, sooner then from the power of any other men: hence we gather, that a father intends better for his children, then any other persons.
						It is to be understood therefore, that the will of the father, dying without Testament, was, that some of his children should <hi rend="italic">succeed </hi>him; yet
						this is to be understood with this proviso, that there be no more apparent tokens to the contrary: of which kind, after many <hi rend="italic">successions</hi>, custome
						may be one, for he that makes no mention of his <hi rend="italic">succession</hi>, is supposed to consent to the customes of his Realme. </p>
					<p> XVI. Among children the Males carry the preheminence, in the beginning perhaps, because for the most part (although not alwayes) they are fitter for the
						administration of greater matters, but specially <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0200" n="145"/>of wars; but afterwards, when it was grown a custome, because that custome was not contradicted; and therefore the will
						of the <hi rend="italic">Father</hi>, unlesse some other custome or signe doe clearly repugne it, is to be interpreted in favour of them. </p>
					<p> XVII. Now because the <hi rend="italic">Sonnes </hi>are equall, and the power cannot be divided, the eldest shall <hi rend="italic">succeed</hi>; for if there be any
						difference by reason of age, the eldest is supposed more worthy, for nature being judge, the most in years (because usually it is so) is the wisest. But other judge
						there cannot be had. But if the Brothers must be equally valued, the <hi rend="italic">succession </hi>shall be <hi rend="italic">by lot</hi>. But <hi rend="italic"
							>primogeniture </hi>is a naturall lot, and by this the eldest is already prefer'd; nor is there any that hath power to judge, whether by this, or any other kind of
						lots the matter is to be decided. Now the same reason which contends thus for the first-born sonne, doth no lesse for the first born daughter. </p>
					<p> XVIII. But if he have no children, then the command shall pass to his Brothers &amp; Sisters, for the same reason, that the children should have <hi rend="italic"
							>succeeded </hi>if he had had them: for those that are nearest to us in nature, are supposed to be nearest in benevolence; and to his brothers, sooner then his
						sisters, and to the elder sooner then the yonger; for the reason is the same for these which it was for the children. </p>
					<p> XIX. Furthermore, by the same reason that men <hi rend="italic">succeed </hi>to the power, doe they also succeed to the Right of <hi rend="italic">succession</hi>:
						for if the first-born dye before the Father, it will be judged, that he transferred his Right of <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0201" n="146"/><hi rend="italic">succession </hi>unto his children, unlesse the Father
						have otherwise decreed it, and therefore the Nephewes will have a fairer pretence to the <hi rend="italic">succession</hi>, then the Uncles. I say all these things will
						be thus, if the custome of the place (which the Father by not contradicting, will be judged to have consented to) doe not hinder them.</p>

						<hi rend="italic">A comparison between 3. kinds of government, according to their severall inconveniences.</hi></head>
					<p>I.  A comparison of the natruall state with the civill.</p>
					<p>II.  The conveniences and inconveniences of the Ruler and his Subjects are alike.</p>
					<p>III.  The praise of Monarchy.</p>
					<p>IV.  The Government under one cannog be said to be unreasonable in this respect, namely because one hath more power then all the rest.</p>
					<p>V.  A Rejection of their opinion, who say that a Lord with his Servants cannot make a City.</p>
					<p>VI.  Exactions are more grievous under a popular State, then a Monarchy.</p>
					<p>VII.  Innocent Subjects<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0202" n="147"/> are lesse exposed to penalties under a Monarch, then under then People.</p>
					<p>VIII.  The liberty of single Subjects is not lesse under a Monarch, then under a People.</p>
					<p>IX.  It is no disadvantage to the Subjects, that they are not all admitted to publick deliberations.</p>
					<p>X.  Civill deliberations are unadvisedly committed to great Assemblies, by reason of the unskilfulness of the most part of men.</p>
					<p>XI.  In regard of eloquence.</p>
					<p>XII.  In regard of faction.</p>
					<p>XIII.  In regard of the unstablenes of the Lawes.</p>
					<p>XIV.  In regard of the want of secrecy.</p>
					<p>XV.  That these inconveniences adhere to Democraty, for asmuch as men are naturally delighted with the esteeme of wit.</p>
					<p>XVI.  The inconveniencies of a City arising from a King that is a childe.</p>
					<p>XVII.  The power of Generalls, is an evident sign of the excellence of Monarchy.</p>
					<p>XVIII.  The best state of a City is that, where the Subjects are the Rulers inheritance.</p>
					<p>XIX.  The nearer Aristocraty drawes to Monarchy, the better it is, the further it keeps from it, the worse.<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0203" n="148"/></p>
					<lb/>
					<p> I. What <hi rend="italic">Democraty</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Aristocraty</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Monarchy </hi>are, hath already been spoken, but which of them
						tends most to the preservation of the subjects Peace, and procuring their advantages, we must see by comparing them together. But first let us set forth the advantages,
						and disadvantages of a City in generall, lest some perhaps should think it better, that every man be left to live at his own will, then to constitute any civill society
						at all. Every man indeed out of the state of civill government hath a most entire, but unfruitfull liberty; because that he who by reason of his own liberty acts all at
						his own will, must also by reason of the same liberty in others, suffer al at anothers wil; but in a constituted City, every subject retains to himselfe as much freedom
						as suffices him to live well, and quietly, &amp; there is so much taken away from others, as may make them not to be feared. Out of this state, every man hath such
						a Right to all, as yet he can enjoy nothing; in it, each one securely enjoyes his limited Right; Out of it, any man may rightly spoyle, or kill one another; in it, none
						but one. Out of it we are protected by our own forces; in it, by the power of all. Out of it no man is sure of the fruit of his labours; in it, all men are. Lastly, out
						of it, there is a Dominion of Passions, war, fear, poverty, slovinlinesse, solitude, barbarisme, ignorance, cruelty. In it, the Dominion of reason, peace, security,
						riches, decency, society, elegancy, sciences, and benevolence. </p>
					<p> II. <hi rend="italic">Aristotle </hi>in his seventh book, and fourteenth Chapter of his Politiques saith, that there are two sorts of governments, <pb
						entity="DSSR_000002537_0204" n="149"/>whereof the one
						relates to the benefit of the <hi rend="italic">Ruler</hi>, the other to that of the <hi rend="italic">Subjects</hi>; as if where Subjects are severely dealt with,
						there were one, and where more mildly, there were <hi rend="italic">another</hi> form of government; which opinion may by no means be subscribed to, for all the profits
						and disprofits arising from government are the same, and common both to the <hi rend="italic">Ruler</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Subject</hi>; The Dammages which
						befall some particular subjects through misfortune, folly, negligence, sloth, or his own luxury, may very well be severed from those which concern the Ruler, but those
						relate not to the government it selfe, being such as may happen in any form of government whatsoever. If these same happen from the first institution of the City, they
						will then be truly called the inconveniencies of government, but they will be common to the Ruler with his subjects, as their benefits are common; but the first and
						greatest benefit, Peace, and defence, is common to both, for both he that commands, and he who is commanded, to the end that he may defend his life, makes use at once
						of all the forces of his fellow-subjects; and in the greatest inconvenience that can befall a City, namely the slaughter of subjects, arising from Anarchy, both the
						Commander, and the Parties commanded, are equally concerned. Next, if the Ruler levie such a summe of vast monies from his subjects, as they are not able to maintain
						themselves, and their families, nor conserve their bodily strength, and vigour, the disadvantage is as much his, as theirs, who with never so great a stock, or measure
						of <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0205" n="150"/>riches, is not able to keep his authority or his riches without the bodies of his subjects; but if he raise no more then is sufficient for the due administration of
						his power, that is a benefit equall to himselfe and his subjects, tending to a common Peace, and defence. Nor is it imaginable which way <hi rend="italic">publick
						</hi>treasures can be a grievance to private subjects, if they be not so exhausted, as to be wholly deprived from all possibility to acquire, even by their industry,
						necessaries to sustain the strength of their bodies, and mindes; for even thus the grievance would concern the Ruler; nor would it arise from the ill institution, or
						ordination of the government, (because in all manner of governments subjects may be opprest) but from the ill administration of a well established government. </p>
					<p> III. Now that <hi rend="italic">Monarchy </hi>of the foresaid forms, of <hi rend="italic">Democraty</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Aristocraty</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
							>Monarchy</hi>, hath the preheminence, will best appear by comparing the conveniences and inconveniences arising in each one of them. Those arguments therefore that
							<hi rend="italic">the whole</hi> universe is governed by <hi rend="italic">one </hi>God; that the <hi rend="italic">Ancients </hi>preferr'd the <hi rend="italic"
							>Monarchicall </hi>state before all others, ascribing the Rule of the Gods to one <hi rend="italic">Jupiter</hi>; that in the beginning of affairs, and of Nations,
						the decrees of Princes were held for Laws; that <hi rend="italic">paternall </hi>government instituted by God himselfe in the Creation, was <hi rend="italic"
							>Monarchicall</hi>. that other governments were compacted by the artifice of men out of the ashes of <hi rend="italic">Monarchy</hi>, after it had been ruined with
						seditions; and that the people of God were under the jurisdiction of Kings, although I <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0206" n="151"/>say these doe hold forth <hi rend="italic">Monarchy </hi>as the more eminent to
						us, yet because they doe it by examples and testimonies, and not by solid reason, we will passe them over. </p>
					<p> Compacted by the artifice of men, &amp;c.] <hi rend="italic">It seems the Ancients who made that same fable of</hi> Prometheus <hi rend="italic">pointed at this.
							They say, that</hi> Prometheus <hi rend="italic">having stolne fire from the Sunne, formed a man out of clay, and that for this deed he was tortured by</hi> Jupiter
							<hi rend="italic">with a perpetuall gnawing in his liver. which is, that by humane invention (which is signified by </hi>Prometheus) <hi rend="italic">Laws and
							Justice were by imitation taken from Monarchy, by vertue whereof (as by fire removed from its naturall orbe) the multitude (as the durt and dregs of men) was as it
							were quickned and formed into a civill Person, which is termed Aristocraty, or Democraty; but the Awthours and Abettors being found, who might securely and quietly
							have lived under the naturall jurisdiction of Kings, doe thus smart for it, that being exposed still to alteration, they are tormented with perpetuall cares,
							suspitions, and dissentions</hi>. </p>
					<p> IV. Some there are who are discontented with the government under <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, for no other reason, but because it is under <hi rend="italic">one</hi>;
						as if it were an unreasonable thing that <hi rend="italic">one man</hi> among so many, should so farre excell in power, as to be able at his own pleasure to dispose of
						all the rest; these men sure, if they could, would withdraw themselves from under the Dominion of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> God. But this exception against <hi
							rend="italic">one </hi>is suggested by envie, while they see one man in possession of what all desire: for the same cause they would judge it to be as unreasonable,
						if a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0207" n="152"/>commanded, unlesse they themselves either were, or hoped to be of the number; for if it be an unreasonable thing that all men have not
						an equall Right, surely an Aristocraty must be unreasonable also. But because we have shewed that the state of equality is the state of warre, and that therefore
						inequality was introduc'd by a generall consent; this inequality whereby he, whom we have voluntarily given more to,enjoyes more, is no longer to be accompted an
						unreasonable thing. The inconveniences therefore which attend the Dominion of <hi rend="italic">one man</hi>, attend his <hi rend="italic">Person</hi>, not his <hi
							rend="italic">Unity</hi>. Let us therefore see whether brings with it the greater grievances to the subject, the command of <hi rend="italic">one man</hi>, or of <hi
							rend="italic">many</hi>. </p>
					<p> V. But first, we must remove their opinion who deny that to be any City at all, which is compacted of never so great a number of servants under a common Lord. In the
						9. Artic. of the 5. Chapter, a <hi rend="italic">City </hi>is defined to be one <hi rend="italic">Person </hi>made out of many men, whose will by their own contracts is
						to be esteemed as the wills of them all, insomuch as he may use the strength and faculties of each single Person for the publick Peace and safety; and by the same
						article of the same Chapter, <hi rend="italic">One Person</hi> is that, when the wills of many are contained in the will of one. But the will of each servant is
						contained in the will of his <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi>, as hath been declared in the 5. Article of the 8. Chapter, so as he may employ all their forces and faculties
						according to his own will, and pleasure; it followes therefore that that must needs be a city, which is constituted by a <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi>, and <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0208" n="153"/>many <hi
							rend="italic">servants</hi>; neither can any reason be brought to contradict this which doth not equally combat against a City constituted by a <hi rend="italic"
							>Father</hi>, and his <hi rend="italic">Sonnes</hi>; for to a <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>who hath no <hi rend="italic">children, servants</hi> are in the nature of
							<hi rend="italic">sonnes</hi>; for they are both his honour, and safeguard; neither are <hi rend="italic">servants </hi>more subject to their <hi rend="italic"
						>Lords</hi>, then <hi rend="italic">children </hi>to their <hi rend="italic">Parents</hi>, as hath been manifested above in the 5. Article of the 8. Chapter. </p>
					<p> VI. Among other grievances of supreme authority one is, that the Ruler, beside those monies necessary for publick charges, as the maintaining of publick Ministers,
						building, and defending of Castles, waging warres, honourable sustaining his own houshold, may also, if he will, exact others through his lust, whereby to enrich his
							<hi rend="italic">sonnes, kindred, favourites,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">flatterers </hi>too. I confesse this is a grievance, but of the number of those which
						accompany all kindes of government, but are more tolerable in a <hi rend="italic">Monarchy </hi>then in a <hi rend="italic">Democraty</hi>; for though the <hi
							rend="italic">Monarch </hi>would enrich them, they cannot be many, because belonging but to one. But in a <hi rend="italic">Democraty</hi>, look how many Demagoges,
						(that is) how many powerfull <hi rend="italic">Oratours </hi>there are with the people (which ever are many, and daily new ones growing) so many <hi rend="italic"
							>Children, Kinsmen, friends, &amp; Flatterers</hi>, are to be rewarded; for every of them desire not onely to make their families as potent, as illustrious in
						wealth, as may be, but also to oblige others to them by benefits for the better strengthning of themselves. A <hi rend="italic">Monarch </hi>may in great part satisfie
						his Officers and Friends, because they are not many, without any cost <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0209" n="154"/>to his Subjects, I mean, without robbing them of any of those Treasures given in for the
						maintenance of War, and Peace; In a <hi rend="italic">Democraty</hi>, where many are to be satisfied, and alwayes new ones, this cannot be done without the Subjects
						oppression. Though a <hi rend="italic">Monarch </hi>may promote unworthy Persons, yet oft times he will not doe it; but in a <hi rend="italic">Democraty </hi>all the
							<hi rend="italic">popular men</hi> are therefore suppos'd to doe it, because it is necessary; for else, the power of them who did it would so encrease, as it would
						not onely become dreadfull to those others, but even to the whole City also. </p>
					<p> VII. Another grievance is, that same perpetuall fear of death which every man must necessarily be in, while he considers with himself that the Ruler hath power. not
						onely to appoint what punishments he lists on any Transgressions, but that he may also in his wrath, and sensuality, slaughter his innocent Subjects, and those who
						never offended against the Lawes. And truly this is a very great grievance in any forme of Government wheresoever it happens: (for it is therefore a grievance because
						it is; not, because it may be done) but it is the fault of the Ruler, not of the Government; For all the acts of <hi rend="italic">Nero </hi>are not essentiall to
						Monarchie; yet Subjects are lesse often undeservedly condemn'd under <hi rend="italic">one Ruler</hi>, then under the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>: For Kings are onely
						severe against those who either trouble them with impertinent Counsells, or oppose them with reproachfull words, or controule their Wills; but they are the cause that
						that excesse of power <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0210" n="155"/>which one Subject might have above another becomes harmlesse. Wherefore some <hi rend="italic">Nero </hi>or <hi rend="italic">Caligula
						</hi>reigning, no men can undeservedly suffer, but such as are known to him, namely Courtiers, and such as are remarkable for some eminent Charge; and not all neither,
						but they onely who are possessed of what he desires to enjoy; for they that are offensive, and contumelious, are deservedly punisht. Whosoever therefore in a <hi
							rend="italic">Monarchy </hi>will lead a retired life, let him be what he will that Reignes, he is out of danger: for the ambitious onely suffer, the rest are
						protected from the injuries of the more potent. But in a <hi rend="italic">popular Dominion</hi> there may be as many <hi rend="italic">Neros</hi>, as there are
						Oratours who sooth the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>; for each one of them can doe as much as the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>, and they mutually give way to each
						others appetite (as it were by this secret pact, <hi rend="italic">Spare me to day, and Ile spare thee to morrow</hi>) while they exempt those from punishment, who to
						satisfie their lust, and private hatred, have undeservedly slain their fellow-subjects. Furthermore, there is a certain limit in private power, which if it exceed, it
						may prove pernicious to the Realme, and by reason whereof it is necessary sometimes for <hi rend="italic">Monarchs </hi>to have a care that the common-weale do thence
						receive no prejudice. When therefore this power consisted in the multitude of Riches, they lessened it by diminishing their heaps; but if it were in <hi rend="italic"
							>popular applause</hi>, the powerfull party without any other crime laid to his charge, was taken from among them. The same was usually practised in <hi rend="italic"
								>Democraties</hi>; for the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0211" n="156"/>Athenians inflicted a punishment of <hi rend="italic">ten yeares banishment</hi> on those that were powerfull, meerly because of their
						powers, without the guilt of any other crime; and those who by liberall gifts did seek the favour of the common people, were put to death at Rome, as men ambitious of a
						Kingdome. In this <hi rend="italic">Democraty </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Monarchy </hi>were eaven; yet differ'd they much in fame, because fame derives from the People,
						and what is done by many, is commended by many: and therefore what the <hi rend="italic">Monarch </hi>does, is said to be done out of envie to their vertues, which if
						it were done by the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>, would be accounted Politie. </p>
					<p> VIII. There are some who therefore imagine <hi rend="italic">Monarchy </hi>to bee more grievous then <hi rend="italic">Democraty</hi>, because there is lesse liberty
							<hi rend="italic">in that</hi>, then in <hi rend="italic">this</hi>. If by <hi rend="italic">liberty </hi>they mean an exemption from that subjection which is due to
						the Lawes (i.e.) the commands of the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>, neither in <hi rend="italic">Democraty</hi>, nor in any other state of government whatsoever, is
						there any such kind of <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi>. If they suppose <hi rend="italic">liberty </hi>to consist in this, that there be few lawes, few prohibitions, and
						those too such, that except they were forbidden, there could be no Peace; then I deny that there is more <hi rend="italic">liberty </hi>in <hi rend="italic">Democraty
						</hi>then <hi rend="italic">Monarchy</hi>; for the one as truly consisteth with such a liberty, as the other. For although the word <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi>, may
						in large, and ample letters be written over the gates of any City whatsoever, yet is it not meant the <hi rend="italic">Subjects</hi>, but the <hi rend="italic">Cities
						</hi>liberty, neither can that word with better Right be inscribed on a City which is governed by the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0212" n="157"/><hi rend="italic">people</hi>, then that which is ruled by a <hi
							rend="italic">Monarch</hi>. But when private men or subjects demand <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi>, under the name of liberty, they ask not for <hi rend="italic"
							>liberty</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">dominion</hi>, which yet for want of understanding, they little consider; for if every man would grant the same liberty to
						another, which he desires for himselfe, as is commanded by the law of nature, that same naturall state would return again, in which all men may by Right doe all things,
						which if they knew, they would abhor, as being worse then all kind of civill subjection whatsoever. But if any man desire to have his single freedome, the rest being
						bound, what does he else demand but to have the <hi rend="italic">Dominion</hi>? for who so is freed from all bonds, is <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>over all those that
						still continue bound. Subjects therefore have no greater liberty in a <hi rend="italic">Popular</hi>, then in a <hi rend="italic">Monarchicall</hi> State. That which
						deceives them, is the equall <hi rend="italic">participation </hi>of command, and publique places; for where the <hi rend="italic">Authority </hi>is in the People,
						single subjects doe so far forth <hi rend="italic">share </hi>in it as they are parts of the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>ruling; and they equally partake in publique
						Offices so far forth as they have equall voices in choosing Magistrates, and publique Ministers. And this is that which <hi rend="italic">Aristotle </hi>aim'd at,
						himself also, through the custome of that time, mis-calling Dominion liberty, in his sixth Book, and second Chapter of <hi rend="italic">Politiques. In a popular State
							there is liberty by supposition; which is a speech of the vulgar, as if no man were free out of this State</hi>. From whence, by the way, we may collect, That those
						Subjects, who in a <hi rend="italic">Monarchy </hi>deplore their lost liberty, doe onely <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0213" n="158"/>stomack this, that they are not receiv'd to the steerage of the Common-weal. </p>
					<p> IX. But perhaps for this very reason some will say, That a <hi rend="italic">Popular State</hi> is much to be preferr'd before a <hi rend="italic">Monarchicall</hi>.
						because that, where all men have a hand in publique businesses, 'there all have an opportunity to shew their wisedome, knowledge, and eloquence, in deliberating matters
						of the greatest difficulty and moment; which by reason of that desire of praise which is bred in humane nature, is to them who excell in such like faculties, and seeme
						to themselves to exceed others, the most delightfull of all things. But in a Monarchy, this same way to obtain praise, and honour, is shut up to the greatest part of
						Subjects; and what is a grievance, if this be none? Ile tell you: To see his opinion whom we scorne, preferr'd before ours; to have our wisedome undervalued before our
						own faces; by an uncertain tryall of a little vaine glory, to undergoe most certaine enmities (for this cannot be avoided, whether we have the better, or the worse); to
						hate, and to be hated, by reason of the disagreement of opinions; to lay open our secret Counsells, and advises to all, to no purpose, and without any benefit; to
						neglect the affaires of our own Family: These, I say, are grievances. But to be absent from a triall of wits, although those trialls are pleasant to the Eloquent, is
						not therefore a grievance to them, unlesse we will say, that it is a grievance to valiant men to be restrained from fighting, because they delight in it. <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0214" n="159"/></p>
					<p> X. Besides, there are many reasons why deliberations are lesse successefull in great Assemblies, then in lesser Councells; whereof one is, that to advise rightly of
						all things conducing to the preservation of a Common-weal, we must not onely understand matters at home, but Forraign Affaires too: at Home, by what goods the Country
						is nourished, and defended, and whence they are fetched; what places are fit to make Garrisons of; by what means Souldiers are best to be raised, and maintained; what
						manner of affections the Subjects bear toward their Prince, or Governours of their Country, and many the like: Abroad, what the power of each neighbouring Country is,
						and wherein it consists; what advantage, or disadvantage we may receive from them; what their dispositions are both to us-ward, and how affected to each other among
						themselves, and what Counsell daily passeth among them. Now, because very few in a great Assembly of men understand these things, being for the most part unskilfull
						(that I say not incapable) of them, what can that same number of advisers with their impertinent Opinions contribute to good Counsells, other then meer letts and
						impediments? </p>
					<p> XI. Another reason why a great Assembly is not so fit for consultation is, because every one who delivers his opinion holds it necessary to make a long continued
						Speech, and to gain the more esteem from his Auditours, he polishes, and adornes it with the best, and smoothest language. Now the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0215" n="160"/>nature of <hi rend="italic">Eloquence
						</hi>is to make <hi rend="italic">Good </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Evill</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Profitable </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Unprofitable</hi>, <hi
							rend="italic">Honest </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Dishonest</hi>, appear to be more or lesse then indeed they are, and to make that seem <hi rend="italic">just</hi>,
						which is <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi>, according as it shall best suit with his end that speaketh. For this is to perswade; and though they reason, yet take they not
						their rise from true Principles, but from vulgar received opinions, which, for the most part, are erroneous; neither endeavour they so much to fit their speech to the
						nature of the things they speak of, as to the Passions of their mindes to whom they speak; whence it happens that opinions are delivered not by right reason, but by a
						certain violence of mind. Nor is this fault in the <hi rend="italic">Man</hi>, but in the nature it selfe of <hi rend="italic">Eloquence</hi>, whose end (as all the
						Masters of Rhetorick teach us) is not truth (except by chance) but victory, and whose property is not to inform, but to allure. </p>
					<p> XII. The third reason why men advise lesse successfully in a great convent is, because that thence arise <hi rend="italic">Factions </hi>in a commonweal, and out of
							<hi rend="italic">Factions</hi>, Seditions, and Civill War; for when equall Oratours doe combat with contrary Opinions, and Speeches, the conquered hates the
						Conquerour, and all those that were of his side, as holding his Counsell, and wisedome in scorne: and studyes all meanes to make the advise of his adversaries
						prejudiciall to the State, for thus he hopes to see the glory taken from him, and restored unto himself. Farthermore, where the Votes are not so unequall, but that the
						conquered have hopes by the accession of some <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0216" n="161"/>few of their own opinion at another sitting to make the stronger Party, the chief heads do call the rest together; they
						advise apart how they may abrogate the former judgment given; they appoint to be the first and earliest at the next convent; they determine what, and in what order each
						man shall speak, that the same businesse may again be brought to agitation, that so what was confirmed before by the number of their then present adversaries, the same
						may now in some measure become of no effect to them, being negligently absent. And this same kind of industry and diligence which they use to <hi rend="italic">make
						</hi>a people, is commonly called a <hi rend="italic">faction</hi>. But when a <hi rend="italic">faction </hi>is inferiour in votes, and superiour, or not much
						inferiour in power, then what they cannot obtain by craft, and language, they attempt by force of armes, and so it comes to a civill warre. But some will say, these
						things doe not necessarily, nor often happen; he may as well say, that the chief Parties are not necessarily desirous of vain glory, and that the greatest of them
						seldom disagree in great matters. </p>
					<p> XIII. It followes hence, that when the legislative power resides in such convents as these, the Laws must needs be inconstant, and change, not according to the
						alteration of the state of affaires, nor according to the changeablenesse of mens mindes, but as the major part, now of this, then of that <hi rend="italic"
						>faction</hi>, do <hi rend="italic">convene</hi>; insomuch as the Laws do flote here, and there, as it were upon the waters. </p>
					<p> XIV. In the fourth place, the counsels of great assemblies have this inconvenience, that whereas it is oft of great consequence, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0217" n="162"/>that they should be kept secret, they
						are for the most part discovered to the enemy before they can be brought to any effect, and their power, and will, is as soon known abroad, as to the <hi rend="italic"
							>People </hi>it selfe <hi rend="italic">commanding </hi>at home. </p>
					<p> XV. These inconveniences which are found in the deliberations of great assemblies do so farre forth evince <hi rend="italic">Monarchy </hi>to be better then <hi
							rend="italic">Democraty</hi>, as in <hi rend="italic">Democraty </hi>affairs of great consequence are oftner trusted to be discussed by such like Committees, then in
						a <hi rend="italic">Monarchy</hi>. Neither can it easily bee done otherwayes; for there is no reason why every man should not naturally rather minde his own private,
						then the <hi rend="italic">publique</hi> businesse, but that here he sees a means to declare his eloquence, whereby he may gain the reputation of being ingenuous, and
						wise, and returning home to his friends, to his Parents, to his wife, and children, rejoyce, and triumph in the applause of his dexterous behaviour: As of old all the
						delight <hi rend="italic">Marcus Coriolanus</hi> had in his warlike actions, was, to see his praises so well pleasing to his Mother. But if the <hi rend="italic">People
						</hi>in a <hi rend="italic">Democraty</hi> would bestow the power of deliberating in matters of Warre, and Peace, either on one, or some very few, being content with
						the nomination of Magistrates, and publique Ministers, that is to say, with the authority without the ministration, then it must be confest, that in this particular,
							<hi rend="italic">Democraty </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Monarchy </hi>would be equall. </p>
					<p> XVI. Neither do the conveniencies or inconveniences which are found to be more in one kind of government then another, arise from <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0218"
						n="163"/>hence, namely, because the
						government it self, or the administration of its affairs, are better committed to one, then many; or on the other side, to many, then to some few. For Government, is
						the <hi rend="italic">power</hi>, the administration of it, is the <hi rend="italic">act</hi>. now the <hi rend="italic">power </hi>in all kind of government is equall;
						the <hi rend="italic">acts </hi>only differ, that is to say the <hi rend="italic">actions</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">motions </hi>of a common-weale, as they flow from
						the deliberations of many, or few, of skilfull, or impertinent men. Whence we understand, that the conveniences, or inconveniences of any government, depend not on him
						in whom the authority resides, but on his Officers; and therefore nothing hinders, but that the common-weale may be well governed, although the <hi rend="italic"
							>Monarch </hi>be a woman, or youth, or infant, provided that they be fit for affaires, who are endued with the publique Offices, and charges; And that which is said,
							<hi rend="italic">Woe to the land whose King is a childe</hi>, doth not signifie the condition of a <hi rend="italic">Monarchy </hi>to be inferiour to a Popular
						state, but contrariwise, that by accident it is the grievance of a Kingdome, that the <hi rend="italic">King being a childe</hi>, it often happens, that many by
						ambition, and power, intruding themselves into publique counsels, the government comes to be administred in a <hi rend="italic">Democraticall </hi>manner, and that
						thence arise those infelicities which for the most part accompany the <hi rend="italic">Dominion of the People</hi>. </p>
					<p> XVII. But it is a manifest sign, that the most absolute <hi rend="italic">Monarchy </hi>is the best state of government, that not onely Kings, but even those Cities
						which are subject to the <hi rend="italic">people</hi>, or to <hi rend="italic">Nobles</hi>, give the whole <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0219" n="164"/>command of warre to one only, and that so absolute, as
						nothing can be more (wherein by the way this must be noted also, that no King can give a Generall greater authority over his army, then he himselfe by Right may
						exercise over all his subjects). <hi rend="italic">Monarchy </hi>therefore is the best of all governments in the Camps. But what else, are many Common-wealths, then so
						many Camps strengthened with armes, and men against each other, whose state (because not restrained by any common power, howsoever an uncertain peace, like a short
						truce, may passe between them) is to be accounted for the state of nature, which is the state of War. </p>
					<p> XVIII. Lastly, since it was necessary for the preservation of our selves to be subject to some <hi rend="italic">Man</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Councell</hi>, we
						cannot on better condition be subject to any, then one whose interest depends upon our safety, and welfare; and this then comes to passe when we are the inheritance of
						the Ruler; for every man of his own accord endeavours the preservation of his inheritance. But the Lands, and Monies of the Subjects are not onely the Princes Treasure,
						but their bodies, and active minds; which will be easily granted by those who consider at how great rates the Dominion of lesser Countries is valued, and how much
						easier it is for men to procure mony, then money men; nor doe we readily meet with any example that shewes us when any subject, without any default of his own, hath by
						his Prince been despoiled of his life, or goods, through the sole licenciousnesse of his Authority. <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0220" n="165"/></p>
					<p> XIX. Hitherto we have compared a <hi rend="italic">Monarchicall</hi>, with a <hi rend="italic">Popular</hi> State; we have said nothing of <hi rend="italic"
							>Aristocracy</hi>; we may conclude of this, by what hath been said of those, that, that which is hereditary, and content with the election of Magistrates; which
						transmits its deliberations to some few, and those most able; which simply imitates the government of <hi rend="italic">Monarchs </hi>most, and the <hi rend="italic"
							>People </hi>least of all, is for the Subjects both better, and more lasting then the rest.</p>

						<hi rend="italic">Places and Examples of Scripture of the Rights of Government agreeable to what hath been said before</hi></head>
					<p>I.  The beginning of institutive Government from the cosent of the People.</p>
					<p>II.  Judicature and Wars depend on the will of Supreme Commanders.</p>
					<p>III.  That they who have the Chief Authority are by Right unpunishable.</p>
					<p>IV.  That without a Supreme Power there is no Government, but Anarchy.</p>
					<p>V.  That from Servants and Sons there is a <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0221" n="166"/> simple obedience due to their Lords, and Parents.</p>
					<p>VI.  Absolute Authority proved by most evident places as well of the New, as the Old Testament.</p>
					<lb/>
					<p> I. We have in the 6. Chapter, and the 2. Article, so derived the Originall of institutive, or politicall Government from the consent of the Multitude, that it appears
						they must either all consent, or be esteem'd as Enemies. Such was the beginning of Gods Government over the Jewes instituted by <hi rend="italic">Moses, If ye will obey
							my voice indeed, &amp;c. Ye shall be unto me a Kingdome of Priests, &amp;c. And Moses came, and called the Elders of the People, &amp;c. And all the
							people answered, and said: All that the Lord hath spoken we will do,</hi> Exod. 19. <hi rend="italic">ver</hi>. 5, 6, 7, 8. Such also was the beginning of <hi
							rend="italic">Moyses </hi>his power under God, or of his Vicegerency. <hi rend="italic">And all the people saw the thunderings and lightenings, and the noyse of the
							Trumpet, &amp;c. And they said unto Moyses, speak thou unto us, and we will hear.</hi> Exod. 20. 18, 19. The like beginning also had <hi rend="italic">Sauls
						</hi>Kingdome. <hi rend="italic">When yee saw that</hi> Nahash <hi rend="italic">King of the children of </hi>Ammon <hi rend="italic">came out against you, yee said
							unto me, nay, but a King shall raign over us, when the Lord your God was your King; Now therefore behold the King whom yee have chosen, and whom yee have
						desired</hi>. 1 Sam. 12. 12. But the major part only consenting, and not all (for there were certain <hi rend="italic">Sons of Belial</hi>, who said, <hi rend="italic"
							>How shall this man save us? and they dispised him,</hi> 1 Sam. 10. 27.) those <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0222" n="167"/>who did not consent were put to death as Enemies; And the people said unto <hi
							rend="italic">Samuel, Who is he that said, shall Saul reign over us? Bring the men that we may put them to death</hi>. 1 Sam. 11: </p>
					<p> II. In the same 6. Chapter, the 6. and 7. Articles, I have shewed, that all <hi rend="italic">Judgment </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Wars </hi>depend upon the will and
						pleasure of him who beares the Supreme Authority; that is to say, in a <hi rend="italic">Monarchy</hi>, on a <hi rend="italic">Monarch</hi>, or <hi rend="italic"
						>King</hi>; and this is confirmed by the Peoples owne judgement. <hi rend="italic">Wee also will be like all the Nations, and our King shall JUDGE us, and goe out
							before us, and fight our BATTELS</hi>. 1 <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi>. 8. 20. And what pertaines to <hi rend="italic">Judgements</hi>, and all other matters, whereof
						there is any controversie, whether they be <hi rend="italic">Good</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Evill</hi>, is confirmed by the testimony of King <hi rend="italic"
							>Solomon. Give therefore thy Servant an understanding heart to JUDGE thy People, that I may discerne between GOOD and EVILL.</hi> 1. Kings 3. 9. And that of Absolom,
							<hi rend="italic">There is no man deputed of the King to heare thee.</hi> 2. Sam. 15. 3. </p>
					<p> III. That Kings may not be punished by their subjects, as hath been shewed above in the sixth Chapter, and the twelfth Article, King <hi rend="italic">David </hi>also
						confirmes, who, though <hi rend="italic">Saul </hi>sought to slay him, did notwithstanding refrain his hand from killing him, and forbad <hi rend="italic">Abishai</hi>,
						saying, <hi rend="italic">Destroy him, not. for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lords Anointed, and be innocent</hi>? 1 Sam: v. 9. And when he had cut off
						the skirt of his garment, The Lord <hi rend="italic">forbid </hi>(saith he)<hi rend="italic"> that I should doe this thing unto my Master the Lords <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0223" n="168"/>Anointed, to
							stretchforth mine hand against him</hi>. 1 Sam. 24. 7. And commanded the Amalekite, who for his sake had slain <hi rend="italic">Saul</hi>, to be put to death. 2 Sam.
						1. 15. </p>
					<p> IV. That which is said in the 17. Chapter of <hi rend="italic">Judges</hi>, at the 6. verse. <hi rend="italic">In those dayes there was no King in Israel, but every
							man did that which was right in his own eyes</hi> (as though where there were not a <hi rend="italic">Monarchy</hi>, there were an <hi rend="italic">Anarchy </hi>or
						confusion of all things) may be brought as a testimony to prove the excellency of Monarchy above all other forms of government, unlesse that by the word <hi
							rend="italic">King </hi>may perhaps be understood, not <hi rend="italic">one man</hi> onely, but also a <hi rend="italic">Court</hi>, provided that in it there reside
						a supreme power; which if it be taken in this sense, yet hence it may follow, that without a supreme and absolute power (which we have endeavoured to prove in the sixth
						Chapter) there will be a liberty for every man to doe what hee hath a minde, or whatsoever shall seem right to himselfe; which cannot stand with the preservation of
						mankinde, and therefore in all Government whatsoever, there is ever a supreme power understood to be somewhere existent. </p>
					<p> V. We have in the 8. Chapter, the 7. and 8. Article, said, that <hi rend="italic">Servants </hi>must yeeld a simple obedience to their <hi rend="italic">Lords</hi>,
						and in the 9. Chapter, Article 7. that Sonnes owe the same obedience to their <hi rend="italic">Parents</hi>. Saint <hi rend="italic">Paul </hi>sayes the same thing
						concerning Servants, <hi rend="italic">Servants obey in all things your Masters according to the flesh, not with eye service, as men-pleasers, but in singlenesse of
							heart, fearing God</hi>. Colos. 3. 22. Concerning Sonnes, <hi rend="italic">Children <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0224" n="169"/>obey your Parents in all things, for this is well pleasing unto the Lord</hi>.
						Colos. 3. 20. Now as wee by simple obedience understand <hi rend="italic">ALL THINGS</hi> which are not contrary to the Lawes of God; so in those cited places of Saint
							<hi rend="italic">Paul</hi>, after the word <hi rend="italic">ALL THINGS</hi>, we.must suppose, <hi rend="italic">excepting those which are contrary to the Lawes of
							God</hi>. </p>
					<p> VI. But that I may not thus by peecemeale prove the right of Princes, I will now instance those testimonies which altogether establish the whole power, (namely that
						there is an absolute and simple obedience due to them from their subjects) And first out of the new Testament. <hi rend="italic">The Scribes and Pharisees sit in</hi>
						Moyses <hi rend="italic">seat; all therefore, whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe, and doe.</hi> Mat. 23. 2. <hi rend="italic">Whatsoever they bid you,
						</hi>(sayes he) <hi rend="italic">observe</hi>, that is to say, obey <hi rend="italic">simply</hi>: Why? Because they <hi rend="italic">sit in</hi> Moyses <hi
							rend="italic">seat</hi>; namely, the <hi rend="italic">civill Magistrates</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">Aaron</hi>, the Priests. <hi rend="italic">Let every soule be
							subject to the higher powers, for there is no Power but of God, the powers that be are ordained of God; whosoever therefore resisteth the Power, resisteth the
							ordinance of God, and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation</hi>. Rom. 13. 1. Now because the powers that were in Saint Pauls time were ordained of
						God, and all Kings did at that time require an absolute entire obedience from their subjects, it followes that such a power was ordained of God. <hi rend="italic"
							>Submit your selves unto every ordinance of man for the Lords sake, whether it bee to the King as supreme, or unto Governours, as unto them that are <pb
								entity="DSSR_000002537_0225" n="170"/>sent by him, for
							the punishment of wicked doers, and for the praise of them that doe well, for so is the will of God</hi>. 1 Pet. 2. 13. <hi rend="italic">Again Saint</hi> Paul to <hi
							rend="italic">Titus</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Put them in mind to bee subject to Principalities and Powers, to obey Magistrates, &amp;c</hi>. Chap. 3. vers. 1. What
						Principalities? Was it not to the Principalities of those times, which required an absolute obedience? Furthermore, that we may come to the example of Christ himselfe,
						to whom the Kingdome of the Jewes belonged by hereditary Right, derived from <hi rend="italic">David </hi>himselfe; He when he lived in the manner of a subject, both
						paid tribute unto <hi rend="italic">Caesar</hi>, and pronounced it to be due to him. <hi rend="italic">Give unto</hi> Caesar (saith he) <hi rend="italic">the things
							which are</hi> Caesars,<hi rend="italic"> and unto God, the things which are Gods</hi>. Mat. 22. 21. When it pleased him to shew himselfe a King, he required entire
						obedience. <hi rend="italic">Goe </hi>(said he) <hi rend="italic">into the village over against you, and straightway yee shall finde an Asse tyed, and a Colt with her,
							loose them, and bring them unto me; and if any man say ought unto you, yee shall say the Lord hath need of them.</hi> Mat: 2. This he did therefore by the right of
						being Lord, or a King of the Jewes. But to take away a subjects goods on this pretence onely, because <hi rend="italic">the Lord hath need of them</hi>, is an absolute
						power. The most evident places in the old Testament are these, <hi rend="italic">Goe thou near, and heare ALL that the Lord our God shall say, and speak thou unto us
							all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee, and we will hear it, and doe it</hi>. Deut. 5. 27. But under the word all, is contained absolute obedience. Again to
						<hi rend="italic">Joshua</hi>.<hi rend="italic"> And they answered</hi> Joshua <hi rend="italic">saying, ALL <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0226" n="171"/>that thou commandest us, we will doe, and whithersoever
							thou sendest us, we will goe; according as we hearkened unto </hi>Moyses <hi rend="italic">in ALL things, so will we hearken unto thee, onely the Lord thy God be with
							thee, as he was with </hi>Moyses; <hi rend="italic">whosoever hee be that doth rebell against thy Commandement, and will not hearken unto thy words in ALL that thou
							commandest him, he shall be put to death.</hi> Joshua 1. 16, 17, 18. And the Parable of the Bramble. <hi rend="italic">Then said all the trees unto the Bramble, Come
							thou, and reign over us; And the Bramble said unto the trees, If in truth yee anoint me King over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow. and if not, let fire
							come out of the Bramble, and devoure the Cedars of</hi> Lebanon. <hi rend="italic">Judges </hi>9. vers. 14, 15. The sense of which words is, that we must acquiese to
						their sayings, whom we have truly constituted to be Kings over us, unlesse we would chuse rather to be consumed by the fire of a civill warre. But the Regall authority
						is more particularly described by God himselfe, in the 1. Sam. 8. vers. 9. &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">Shew them the Right of the King that shall reign over them,
							&amp;c. This shall be the Right of the King that shall reign over you; he will take your Sons, and appoint them for himself, for his Chariots, and to be his
							horsemen, and some shall runne before his Chariots, &amp;c. And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, &amp;c. And he will take your vineyards,
							and give them to his Servants, &amp;c</hi>. Is not this power absolute? And yet it is by God himself styled the <hi rend="italic">KINGS RIGHT</hi>; neither was
						any man among the Jewes, no not the <hi rend="italic">High Priest</hi> himselfe, exempted from this obedience. For when the King (namely <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0227"
							n="172"/><hi rend="italic">Solomon</hi>)
						said to Abiathar <hi rend="italic">the Priest</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Get thee to</hi> Anathoth<hi rend="italic"> unto thine own fields, for thou art worthy of death,
							but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the Ark of the Lord God before </hi>David<hi rend="italic"> my father, and because thou hast been
							afflicted in all wherein my Father was afflicted. So</hi> Solomon <hi rend="italic">thrust out</hi> Abiathar <hi rend="italic">from being Priest unto the Lord</hi>. 1
						Kings. 2. 26. It cannot by any argument be proved, that this act of his displeased the Lord; neither read we, that either <hi rend="italic">Solomon </hi>was reproved,
						or that his Person at that time was any whit lesse acceptable to God.</p>

						<hi rend="italic">Of the internal causes, tending to the dissolution of any Government</hi></head>
					<p>I.  That the judging of good and evill belongs to private Persons, is a seditious opinion.</p>

					<p>III.  That Tyrannicide is lawfull, is a seditious opinion.</p>
					<p>IV.  That those who have the supreme power, are subject to the civill Lawes, is a seditious opinion.</p>

					<p>VI.  That faith, and sanctity, are not acquired by study and reason, but alwayes supernaturally infused, and inspired, is a seditious opinion.</p>
					<p>VII.  That each subject hath a propriety, or absolute Dominion of his owne goods, is a seditious opinion.</p>
					<p>VIII.  Not to understand the difference between the People and the Multitude, prepares toward sedition.</p>
					<p>IX.  Too great a Taxe of monies, though never so just and necessary, prepares toward sedition.</p>
					<p>X.  Ambition disposeth us to sedition.</p>
					<p>XI.  So doth the hope of successe.</p>
					<p>XII.  Eloquence alone without wisdom, is the only faculty needfull to raise seditions.</p>
					<p>XIII.  How the folly of the common people, and the eloquution of ambitious men, concur to the destruction of a Common-weale.</p>
					<lb/>
					<p> I. Hitherto hath been spoken by what causes, and Pacts, Common-weals are constituted, and what the Rights of Princes are over their subjects; Now we will briefly say
						somewhat concerning the causes which dissolve them, or the reasons of seditions. Now as in the motion of naturall bodies, three things are to be <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0229" n="174"/>considered, namely, <hi
							rend="italic">internall disposition</hi>, that they be susceptible of the motion to be produced; the <hi rend="italic">externall Agent</hi>, whereby a certain and
						determined motion may in act be produced; and the <hi rend="italic">action it selfe</hi>: So also in a Common-weale where the subjects begin to raise tumults, three
						things present themselves to our regard; First the <hi rend="italic">Doctrines </hi>and the <hi rend="italic">Passions </hi>contrary to Peace, wherewith the mindes of
						men are fitted and disposed; next their quality and condition who sollicite, assemble, and direct them already thus disposed, to take up armes, and quit their
						allegiance; Lastly, the manner how this is done, or the <hi rend="italic">faction</hi> it selfe. But one, and the first which disposeth them to sedition, is this, <hi
							rend="italic">That the knowledge of good and evill belongs to each single man</hi>. In the state of nature indeed, where every man lives by equall Right, and have not
						by any mutuall Pacts submitted to the command of others, we have granted this to be true, nay in the first Chapter, Article 9. we have demonstrated it. But in the civil
						state it is false. For it was shown in chap. 6. art. 9] that the civill Lawes were the Rules <hi rend="italic">of good and evill, just</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
						>unjust</hi>, <hi rend="italic">honest </hi>and <hi rend="italic">dishonest</hi>; that therefore what the Legislator commands, must be held for <hi rend="italic"
						>good</hi>, and what he forbids for <hi rend="italic">evill</hi>; and the Legislator is ever that Person who hath the supreme power in the Commonweale, that is to say,
						the Monarch in a Monarchy. We have confirmed the same truth in the eleventh Chapter, Article 2. out of the words of <hi rend="italic">Solomon</hi>; for if private men
						may pursue that as good, and shun that as evill which appears to them to be so, to what end serve those words of his? <hi rend="italic">Give therefore unto thy servant
							an understanding <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0230" n="175"/>heart to judge thy People, that I may discern between good and evill</hi>. Since therefore it belongs to Kings to discerne betweene <hi rend="italic"
							>good </hi>and <hi rend="italic">evill</hi>, wicked are those, though usuall sayings, <hi rend="italic">that he onely is a King who does righteously, and that Kings
							must not be obeyed, unlesse they command us just things</hi>, and many other such like. Before there was any government, <hi rend="italic">just </hi>and <hi
							rend="italic">unjust </hi>had no being, their nature onely being relative to some command, and every action in its own nature is indifferent; that it becomes <hi
							rend="italic">just</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi>, proceeds from the right of the Magistrate: Legitimate Kings therefore make the things they command, just,
						by commanding them, and those which they forbid, unjust, by forbidding them; but private men while they assume to themselves the knowledge of <hi rend="italic">good
						</hi>and <hi rend="italic">evill</hi>, desire to be even as Kings, which cannot be with the safety of the Common weale. The most ancient of all Gods commands is, <hi
							rend="italic">Gen</hi>. 2. 15. <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt not eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evill</hi>; and the most ancient of all diabolicall
						tentations, Chap. 3. vers. 5. <hi rend="italic">Yee shall be as Gods, knowing good and evill</hi>; and Gods first expostulation with man, vers. 11. <hi rend="italic"
							>Who told thee that thou wert naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?</hi> As if he had said, how comest thou to
						judge that nakedness, wherein it seemed good to me to create thee, to be shamefull, except thou have arrogated to thy selfe the <hi rend="italic">knowledge </hi>of good
						and evill? </p>
					<p> II. Whatsoever any man doth against his conscience is a sinne, for he who doth <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0231" n="176"/>so, contemns the Law. But we must distinguish: That is my sinne indeed, which
						committing, I doe beleeve to be my sinne; but what I beleeve to be another mans sin, I may sometimes doe that without any sin of mine. For if I be commanded to doe that
						which is a sin in him who commands me, if I doe it, and he that commands me be by Right, Lord over me, I sinne not; for if I wage warre at the Commandement of my
						Prince, conceiving the warre to be unjustly undertaken, I doe not therefore doe unjustly, but rather if I refuse to doe it, arrogating to my selfe the knowledge of what
						is just and unjust, which pertains onely to my Prince. They who observe not this distinction, will fall into a necessity of sinning, as oft as any thing is commanded
						them, which either is, or seems to be unlawfull to them: for if they obey, they sin against their conscience, and if they obey not, against Right. If they sin against
						their conscience, they declare that they fear not the paines of the world to come; if they sinne against Right, they doe as much as in them lyes, abolish humane
						society, and the civill life of the present world. Their opinion therefore who teach, <hi rend="italic">that subjects sinne when they obey their Princes commands, which
							to them seem unjust</hi>, is both erroneous, and to be reckoned among those which are contrary to civill obedience; and it depends upon that originall errour which we
						have observed above in the foregoing Article; for by our taking upon us to judge of <hi rend="italic">good </hi>and <hi rend="italic">evill</hi>, we are the occasion,
						that as well our obedience, as disobedience, becomes sin unto us. <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0232" n="177"/></p>
					<p> III. The third seditious doctrine springs from the same root, <hi rend="italic">That Tyrannicide is lawfull</hi>; Nay, at this day it is by many Divines, and of old
						it was by all the Philosophers, <hi rend="italic">Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Seneca, Plutarch</hi>, and the rest of the maintainers of the Greek, and Roman Anarchies,
						held not only lawful, but even worthy of the greatest praise. And under the title of Tyrants, they mean not onely Monarchs, but all those who bear the chief rule in any
						Government whatsoever; for not Pisistratus onely at Athens, but those thirty also who succeeded him, and ruled together, were all called <hi rend="italic">Tyrants</hi>.
						But he, whom men require to be put to death as being <hi rend="italic">a Tyrant</hi>, commands either by Right, or without Right; if without Right, he is an enemy, and
						by Right to be put to death; but then this must not be called <hi rend="italic">the killing a Tyrant</hi>, but an <hi rend="italic">enemy</hi>: if by Right, then the
						divine interrogation takes place, <hi rend="italic">Who hath told thee that he was a Tyrant, hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest
							not eat</hi>? For why doest thou call him a <hi rend="italic">Tyrant</hi>, whom God hath made a <hi rend="italic">King</hi>, except that thou being a private Person,
						usurpest to thy self the knowledge of <hi rend="italic">good </hi>and <hi rend="italic">evill</hi>? But how pernicious this opinion is to all governments, but
						especially to that which is <hi rend="italic">Monarchicall</hi>, we may hence discerne, namely, that by it every <hi rend="italic">King</hi>, whether good or ill,
						stands exposed to be condemned by the judgement, and slain by the hand of every murtherous villain. </p>
					<p> IV. The fourth adversary opinion to Civill Society, is theirs, who hold, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0233" n="178"/><hi rend="italic">That they who bear Rule are Subject also to the Civill Lawes</hi>. Which
						hath been sufficiently proved before not to be true in the 6. Chap. Artic. 14. from this Argument, That a City can neither be bound to it self, nor to any subject; not
						to it selfe, because no man can be obliged except it be to another; not to any Subject, because the single wills of the Subjects are contained in the will of the City,
						insomuch, that if the City will be free from all such obligation, the Subjects will so too; and by consequence she is so. But that which holds true in a City, that must
						be supposed to be true in a man, or an assembly of men, who have the Supreme Authority, for they make a City, which hath no being but by their Supreme Power. Now that
						this Opinion cannot consist with the very being of Government, is evident from hence, that by it the knowledge of what is <hi rend="italic">Good </hi>and <hi
							rend="italic">Evill</hi>, that is to say, the definition of what is, and what is not against the Lawes, would return to each single Person: Obedience therefore will
						cease as oft as any thing seemes to be commanded contrary to the Civill Lawes, and together with it, all coercive jurisdiction, which cannot possibly be without the
						destruction of the very essence of Government. Yet this Errour hath great props, <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>, and others; who, by reason of humane infirmity,
						suppose the Supreme Power to be committed with most security to the Lawes onely; but they seem to have lookt very shallowly into the nature of, Government, who thought
						that the constraining Power, the interpretation of Lawes, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0234" n="179"/>and the making of Lawes, (all which are powers necessarily belonging to Government) should be left wholly to
						the Lawes themselves. Now although particular Subjects may sometimes contend in judgement, and goe to Law with the Supreme Magistrate, yet this is onely then, when the
						question is not what the Magistrate may, but what by a certain Rule he hath declared he would doe. As, when by any Law the Judges sit upon the life of a Subject, the
						question is not whether the Magistrate could by his absolute Right deprive him of his life; but whether by that Law his will was that he should be deprived of it; but
						his will was, he should, if he brake the Law. else, his will was he should not: This therefore, that a Subject may have an action of Law against his Supreme Magistrate,
						is not strength of Argument sufficient to prove that he is tyed to his own Lawes. On the contrary, it is evident, that he is not tied to his owne Lawes, because no man
						is bound to himself. Lawes therefore are set for Titius, and Caius, not for the Ruler: however, by the ambition of Lawyers, it is so ordered, that the Lawes, to
						unskilfull men seeme not to depend on the Authority of the Magistrate, but their Prudence. </p>
					<p> V. In the fifth place, <hi rend="italic">That the Supreme Authority may be divided</hi>, is a most fatall Opinion to all Common-weales. But diverse men divide it
						diverse wayes. For some divide it so as to grant a Supremacy to the Civill Power in <hi rend="italic">matters </hi>pertaining to Peace, and the benefits of this life,
						but in things concerning the salvation of the Soul <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0235" n="180"/>they transfer it on others. Now, because justice is of all things most necessary to Salvation, it happens, that
						Subjects measuring justice, not as they ought, by the Civill Lawes, but by the precepts and doctrines of them who, in regard of the Magistrate, are either private mens
						or strangers, through a superstitious fear dare not perform the obedience due to their Princes, through fear falling into that which they most feared: Now what can be
						more pernicious to any state, then that men should, by the apprehension of everlasting torments, be deterred from obeying their Princes, that is to say, the Lawes, or
						from being just? There are also some who divide the Supreme Authority so as to allow the power of War, and Peace, unto one, (whom they call a <hi rend="italic"
						>Monarch</hi>) but the right of raising Monies they give to some others, and not to him: But because monies are the sinewes of War, and Peace, they who thus divide the
						Authority, doe either really not divide it at all, but place it wholly in them, in whose power the money is, but give the name of it to another, or if they doe really
						divide it, they dissolve the Government: for neither upon necessity can War be waged, nor can the publique Peace be preserved without Money. </p>
					<p> VI. It is a common doctrine, <hi rend="italic">That faith and holinesse are not acquired by study, and naturall reason, but are alwayes supernaturally infused, and
					inspired into men</hi>: which, if it were true, I understand not why we should be commanded to give an account of our faith; or why any man, who is truly a <pb
						entity="DSSR_000002537_0236" n="181"/>Christian,
						should not be a Prophet; or lastly, why every man should not judge what's fit for him to doe, what to avoid, rather out of his own inspiration, then by the precepts of
						his Superiours, or right Reason. A return therefore must be made to the private knowledge of <hi rend="italic">Good </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Evil</hi>; which cannot
						be granted without the ruine of all Governments. This Opinion hath spread it self so largely through the whole Christian world, that the number of Apostates from
						natural reason is almost become infinite. And it sprang from sick-brained men, who having gotten good store of Holy Words by frequent reading of the Scriptures, made
						such a connexion of them usually in their preaching, that their Sermons, signifying just nothing, yet to unlearned men seemed most divine; for he whose non-sense
						appears to be a Divine speech, must necessarily seeme to be inspired from above. </p>
					<p> VII. The seventh Doctrine opposite to Government, is this, <hi rend="italic">That each subject hath an absolute Dominion over the goods he is in possession of</hi>.
						That is to say, such a <hi rend="italic">propriety </hi>as excludes not only the right of all the rest of his fellow-subjects to the same goods, but also of the
						Magistrate himself. Which is not true; for they who have a <hi rend="italic">Lord </hi>over them, have themselves no <hi rend="italic">Lordship</hi>, as hath been
						proved, Chap. 8. Artic. 5. Now the Magistrate is Lord of all his Subjects, by the constitution of Government. Before the yoke of Civill Society was undertaken, no man
						had any <hi rend="italic">proper Right</hi>; all things were <hi rend="italic">common </hi>to all men. Tell me therefore, how <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0237" n="182"/>gottest thou this <hi rend="italic"
							>propriety </hi>but from the Magistrate? How got the Magistrates it, but that every man transferred his Right on him? And thou therefore hast also given up thy Right
						to him; thy <hi rend="italic">Dominion </hi>therefore, and <hi rend="italic">Propriety</hi>, is just so much as he will, and shall last so long as he pleases; even as
						in a Family, each Son hath such <hi rend="italic">proper </hi>goods, and so long lasting, as seeme good to the Father. But the greatest part of men who professe Civill
						Prudence, reason otherwise; we are equall (say they) by nature; there is no reason why any man should by better Right take my goods from me, then I his from him; we
						know that mony sometimes is needfull for the defence and maintenance of the publique; but let them, who require it, shew us the present necessity, and they shall
						willingly receive it. They who talk thus, know not, that what they would have, is already done from the beginning in the very constitution of Government, and therefore
						speaking as in a dissolute multitude, and yet not fashioned Government, they destroy the frame. </p>
					<p> VIII. In the last place, it's a great hindrance to Civill Government, especially Monarchicall, that men distinguish not enough between a <hi rend="italic">People
						</hi>and a <hi rend="italic">Multitude</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">People </hi>is somewhat that is <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, having <hi rend="italic">one will</hi>,
						and to whom one action may be attributed; none of these can properly be said of a Multitude. The <hi rend="italic">People </hi>rules in all Governments, for even in <hi
							rend="italic">Monarchies </hi>the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>Commands; for the <hi rend="italic">People </hi>wills by the will of <hi rend="italic">one man</hi>;
						but the Multitude are <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0238" n="183"/>Citizens, that is to say, Subjects. In a <hi rend="italic">Democraty</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Aristocraty</hi>, the Citizens are the <hi
							rend="italic">Multitude</hi>, but the <hi rend="italic">Court </hi>is the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>. And in a <hi rend="italic">Monarchy</hi>, the Subjects are
						the <hi rend="italic">Multitude</hi>, and (however it seeme a Paradox) the King is the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>. The common sort of men, and others who little
						consider these truthes, do alwayes speak of a <hi rend="italic">great number</hi> of men, as of the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>, that is to say, the <hi rend="italic"
							>City</hi>; they say that the <hi rend="italic">City </hi>hath rebelled against the <hi rend="italic">King </hi>(which is impossible) and that the <hi rend="italic"
							>People </hi>will, and nill, what murmuring and discontented Subjects would have, or would not have, under pretence of the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>, stirring up
						the <hi rend="italic">Citizens </hi>against the <hi rend="italic">City</hi>, that is to say, the <hi rend="italic">Multitude </hi>against the <hi rend="italic"
						>People</hi>. And these are almost all the Opinions wherewith Subjects being tainted doe easily Tumult. And forasmuch as in all manner of Government Majesty is to be
						preserv'd by him, or them who have the Supreme Authority, the <foreign lang="lat">
							<hi rend="italic">crimen laesae Majestatis</hi>
						</foreign> naturally cleaves to these Opinions. </p>
					<p> IX. There is nothing more afflicts the mind of man then <hi rend="italic">Poverty</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">want </hi>of those things which are necessary for the
						preservation of life, and honour; and though there be no man but knowes that riches are gotten with industry, and kept by frugality, yet all the poor commonly lay the
						blame on the Evill Government, excusing their own sloth, and luxury, as if their private goods forsooth were wasted by publique exactions; But men must consider, that
						they who have no patrimony, must not onely labour that they may live, but fight <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0239" n="184"/>too, that they may labour. Every one of the Jewes, who in <hi rend="italic">Esdras
						</hi>his time built the Walls of <hi rend="italic">Jerusalem</hi>, did the work with one hand, and held the Sword in the other. In all Government we must conceive that
						the hand which holds the Sword is the <hi rend="italic">King</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Supreme Councell</hi>, which is no lesse to be sustained, and nourisht, by the
						Subjects care and industry, then that wherewith each man procures himself a private fortune; and that <hi rend="italic">Customes</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
						>Tributes</hi>, are nothing else but their reward who watch in Armes for us, that the labours and endeavours of single men may not be molested by the incursion of
						enemies; and that their complaint, who impute their poverty to publick Persons, is not more just, then if they should say that they are become in want by paying of
						their debts: But the most part of men consider nothing of these things, for they suffer the same thing with them who have a disease they call an <hi rend="italic"
							>Incubus</hi>, which springing from Gluttony, it makes men believe they are invaded, opprest, and stifled with a great weight: Now it is a thing manifest of it selfe,
						that they who seeme to themselves to be burthened with the whole load of the Common-weal, are prone to be Seditious; and that they are affected with change, who are
						distasted at the present state of things. </p>
					<p> X. Another noxious disease of the mind is theirs, who having little employment, want Honour and Dignity. All men naturally strive for Honour, and Preferment, but
						chiefly they who are least <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0240" n="185"/>troubled with caring for necessary things. For these men are invited by their vacancy sometimes to disputation among themselves concerning
						the Common-weal, sometimes to an easie reading of Histories, Politiques, Orations, Poems, and other pleasant Books; and it happens, that hence they think themselves
						sufficiently furnisht both with wit, and learning, to administer matters of the greatest consequence. Now because all men are not what they appear to themselves, and if
						they were, yet all (by reason of the multitude) could not be received to publique Offices, its necessary that many must be passed by. These therefore conceiving
						themselves affronted, can desire nothing more, partly out of envy to those who were preferred before them, partly out of hope to overwhelm them, then ill successe to
						the publique Consultations; and therefore its no marvell if with greedy appetites they seek for occasions of innovations. </p>
					<p> XI. <hi rend="italic">The hope of overcomming</hi> is also to be numbred among other seditious inclinations. For let there be as many men as you wil, infected with
						opinions repugnant to Peace, and civill Government; let there be as many as there can, never so much wounded and torne with affronts, and calumnies, by them who are in
						Authority; yet if there be no <hi rend="italic">hope of having the better of them</hi>, or it appear not sufficient, there will no sedition follow; every man will
						dissemble his thoughts, and rather content himself with the present burthen, then hazard an heavier weight. There are four things <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0241" n="186"/>necessarily requisite to this <hi
							rend="italic">hope</hi>: Numbers, Instruments, mutuall trust, and Commanders. To resist publique Magistrates without a great number, is not Sedition, but Desperation.
						By Instruments of war I mean <hi rend="italic">all manner of armes, munition</hi>, and other necessary provision, without which Number can doe nothing, nor Arms neither
						without <hi rend="italic">mutuall trust</hi>; Nor all these without union under some Commander, whom of their own accord, they are content to, obey. not as being
						engaged by their submission to his command (for we have already in this very Chapter, supposed these kind of men not to understand, being obliged beyond that which
						seems right and good in their own eyes) but for some opinion they have of his vertue, or military skill, or resemblance of humours. If these four be near at hand to men
						grieved with the present state, and measuring the justice of their actions by their own judgements, there will be nothing wanting to sedition and confusion of the
						Realme, but one to stirre up and quicken them. </p>
					<p> XII. <hi rend="italic">Salust </hi>his Character of <hi rend="italic">Catiline</hi>, (then whom there never was a greater Artist in raising seditions) is this, <hi
							rend="italic">That he had great eloquence, and little wisdome</hi>. he separates <hi rend="italic">wisdome </hi>from <hi rend="italic">eloquence</hi>, attributing
						this as necessary to a man born for commotions, adjudging that as an instructresse of Peace, and quietnesse. Now, <hi rend="italic">eloquence </hi>is twofold. The one
						is an elegant, and cleare expression of the conceptions of the mind, and riseth partly from the contemplation of the things themselves, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0242"
							n="187"/>partly from an understanding of
						words taken in their own proper, and definite signification; the other is a commotion of the Passions of the minde (such as are <hi rend="italic">hope, fear, anger,
							pitty</hi>) and derives from a metaphoricall use of words fitted to the Passions: That forms a speech from true Principles, this from opinions already received, what
						nature soever they are of. The art of that is Logick, of this Rhetorick; the end of that is truth, of this victory. Each hath its use, that in deliberations, this in
						exhortations; for that is never disjoyned from <hi rend="italic">wisdome</hi>, but this almost ever. But that this kind of powerfull <hi rend="italic">eloquence</hi>,
						separated from the true knowledge of things, that is to say, from wisdome, is the true character of them who sollicite, and stirre up the people to innovations, may
						easily be gathered out of the work it selfe which they have to doe; for they could not poyson the people with those absurd opinions contrary to Peace and civill
						society, unlesse they held them themselves, which sure is an ignorance greater then can well befall any wise man. For he that knows not whence the Lawes derive their
						power, which are the Rules of <hi rend="italic">just </hi>and <hi rend="italic">unjust, honest</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dishonest, good</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
							>evill</hi>; what makes and preserves Peace among men, what destroyes it; what is <hi rend="italic">his</hi>, and what <hi rend="italic">anothers</hi>; Lastly, what
						he would have done to himselfe (that he may doe the like to others) is surely to be accounted but meanly wise. But that they can turn their Auditors out of fools into
						madmen; that they can make things to them who are ill-affected seem worse, to them who are well-affected seem evil; that <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0243" n="188"/>they can enlarge their hopes, lessen their
						dangers beyond reason: this they have from that sort of eloquence, not which explains things as they are, but from that other, which by moving their mindes, makes all
						things to appear to bee such as they in their mindes prepared before, had already conceived them. </p>
					<p> XIII. Many men who are themselves very well affected to civill society, doe through want of knowledge, cooperate to the disposing of subjects mindes to <hi
							rend="italic">sedition</hi>, whilst they teach young men a doctrine conformable to the said opinions in their Schooles, and all the people in their Pulpits. Now they
						who desire to bring this disposition into Act, place their whole endeavour in this, First, that they may joyn the ill affected together into <hi rend="italic">faction
						</hi>and <hi rend="italic">conspiracy</hi>; next, that themselves may have the greatest stroke in the <hi rend="italic">faction</hi>: They gather them into <hi
							rend="italic">faction</hi>, while they make themselves the relators, and interpretors of the counsels and actions of single men, and nominate the Persons and Places,
						to assemble and deliberate of such things whereby the present government may be reformed, according as it shall seem best to their interests. Now to the end that they
						themselves may have the chief rule in the <hi rend="italic">faction</hi>, The <hi rend="italic">faction </hi>must be kept in a <hi rend="italic">faction</hi>, that is
						to say, they must have their secret meetings apart with a few, where they may order what shall afterward be propounded in a general meeting, and by whom, and on what
						subject, and in what order each of them shall speak, and how they may draw the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0244" n="189"/>powerfullest, and most popular men of the <hi rend="italic">faction </hi>to their side:
						And thus when they have gotten a faction big enough, in which they may rule by their eloquence, they move it to take upon it the managing of affaires; and thus they
						sometimes oppresse the Commonwealth, namely where there is no other faction to oppose them, but for the most part they rend it, and introduce a civill warre. For <hi
							rend="italic">folly </hi>and <hi rend="italic">eloquence</hi> concurre in the subversion of government in the same manner (as the fable hath it) as heretofore the
						daughters of Pelias King of Thessaly, conspired with <hi rend="italic">Medea </hi>against their father; They going to restore the decrepit old man to his youth again,
						by the counsell of <hi rend="italic">Medea</hi>, they cut him into peeces, and set him in the fire to boyle, in vain expecting when he would live again; So the common
						people through their folly (like the daughters of <hi rend="italic">Pelias</hi>) desiring to renew the ancient government, being drawne away by the <hi rend="italic"
							>eloquence </hi>of ambitious men, as it were by the witchcraft of <hi rend="italic">Medea</hi>, divided into <hi rend="italic">faction</hi>, they consume it rather by
						those flames, then they reforme it.</p>

					<lb/>
					<p> I. By what hath hitherto been said, the <hi rend="italic">duties </hi>of Citizens and in any kind of government whatsoever, and the <hi rend="italic">power </hi>of
						the supreme Ruler over them are apparent; but we have as yet said nothing of the <hi rend="italic">duties </hi>of Rulers, and how they ought to behave themselves
						towards their Subjects; We must then distinguish between the <hi rend="italic">Right</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">exercise </hi>of supreme authority, for they can be
						divided; as for example, when he who hath the <hi rend="italic">Right</hi>, either cannot, or will not be present in judging trespasses, or deliberating of affaires:
						For Kings sometimes by reason of their age cannot order their affaires, sometimes also though they can doe it themselves, yet they judge it fitter, being satisfied in
						the choyce of their Officers and Counsellors, to exercise their power by them. Now where the <hi rend="italic">Right </hi>and <hi rend="italic">exercise </hi>are
						severed, there the government of the Commonweale, is like the ordinary government of the world, in which <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0247" n="192"/>God, the mover of all things, produceth naturall effects by the
						means of secondary causes; but where he, to whom the Right of ruling doth belong, is himselfe present in all judicatures, consultations, and publique actions, there the
						administration is such, as if God beyond the ordinary course of nature, should immediately apply himself unto all matters. We will therefore in this Chapter summarily
						and briefly speak somewhat concerning their <hi rend="italic">duties </hi>who exercise authority, whether by their own or others Right. Nor is it my purpose to descend
						into those things, which being divers from others, some Princes may doe, for this is to be left to the Politicall Practices of each Common weale. </p>
					<p> II. Now all the duties of Rulers are contained in this one sentence, <hi rend="italic">The safety of the people is the supreme Law</hi>; for although they who among
						men obtain the chiefest Dominion, cannot be subject to Lawes properly so called, that is to say, to the will of men, because to be chief, and subject, are
						contradictories; yet is it their <hi rend="italic">duty </hi>in all things, as much as possibly they can, to yeeld obedience unto right reason, which is the naturall,
						morall, and divine Law. But because dominions were constituted for Peaces sake, and Peace was sought after for safeties sake, he, who being placed in authority, shall
						use his power otherwise then to the safety of the people, will act against the reasons of Peace, that is to say, against the Lawes of nature; Now as the safety of the
						People dictates a Law by which Princes know their <hi rend="italic">duty</hi>, so doth it also teach them <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0248" n="193"/>an art how to procure themselves a benefit; for the power of
						the Citizens, is the power of the City, that is to say, his that bears the chief Rule in any state. </p>
					<p> III. By the people in this place we understand, not one civill Person, namely the City it selfe which governs, but the multitude of subjects which are governed; for
						the City was not instituted for its own, but for the subjects sake; and yet a particular care is not required of <hi rend="italic">this </hi>or <hi rend="italic">that
						</hi>man; for the Ruler (as such) provides no otherwise for the safety of his people, then by his Lawes, which are universall; and therefore he hath fully <hi
							rend="italic">discharged </hi>himselfe, if he have throughly endeavoured by wholesome constitutions, to establish the welfare of the most part, and made it as lasting
						as may be; and that no man suffer ill, but by his own default, Or by some chance which could not be prevented; but it sometimes conduces to the safety of the most part,
						that wicked men doe suffer. </p>
					<p> IV. But by <hi rend="italic">safety </hi>must be understood, not the sole preservation. of life in what condition soever, but in order to its happines. For to this
						end did men freely assemble themselves, and <hi rend="italic">institute </hi>a government, that they might, as much as their humane condition would afford, live
						delightfully. They therefore who had undertaken the administration of power in such a kinde of government, would sinne against the Law of nature (because against their
						trust who had committed that power unto them) if they should not study, as much as by good Laws could be effected, to furnish their subjects <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0249"
							n="194"/>abundantly, not only with
						the good things belonging to life, but also with those which advance to delectation. They who have acquired Dominion by arms, doe all desire that their subjects may be
						strong in body and mind, that they may serve them the better; wherefore if they should not endeavour to provide them, not only with such things whereby they may live,
						but also with such whereby they may grow strong and lusty, they would act against their own scope and end. </p>
					<p> V. And first of all, Princes doe beleeve that it mainly concerns <hi rend="italic">eternall salvation</hi>, what opinions are held of the Deity, and what manner of
						worship he is to be adored with; which being supposed, it may be demanded, whether chief Rulers, and whosoever they be, whether one or more, who exercise supreme
						authority, sin not against the Law of nature, if they cause not such a doctrine, and worship, to be taught and practised (or permit a contrary to be taught and
						practised) as they beleeve necessarily conduceth to the <hi rend="italic">eternall salvation</hi> of their subjects? It is manifest that they act against their
						conscience, and that they will, as much as in them lies, the eternall perdition of their subjects; for if they willed it not, I see no reason why they should suffer,
						(when being supreme they cannot be compelled) such things to be taught and done, for which they beleeve them to be in a damnable state. But we will leave this
						difficulty in suspence. </p>
					<p> VI. The benefits of subjects respecting this life only, may be distributed into foure <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0250" n="195"/>kindes. 1. That they be defended against forraign enemies. 2. That Peace be
						preserved at home. 3. That they be enrich't as much as may consist with publique security. 4. That they enjoy a harmelesse liberty; For supreme Commanders can conferre
						no more to their civill happinesse, then that being preserved from forraign and civill warres, they may quietly enjoy that wealth which they have purchased by their own
						industry. </p>
					<p> VII. There are two things necessary for the Peoples defence; <hi rend="italic">To be warned, and to be forearmed</hi>; for the state of Common-wealths considered in
						themselves, is natural, that is to say, hostile; neither if they cease from fighting, is it therefore to be called Peace, but rather a breathing time, in which one
						enemy observing the motion and countenance of the other, values his security not according to the Pacts, but the forces and counsels of his adversary; And this by
						naturall Right, as hath been shewed in the second Chapter, 10. Artic. from this, that contracts are invalid in the state of nature, as oft as any just fear doth
						intervene; It is therefore necessary to the defence of the City, First, that there be some who may as near as may be, <hi rend="italic">search into</hi>, and <hi
							rend="italic">discover </hi>the counsels and motions of all those who may prejudice it. For <hi rend="italic">discoverers </hi>to Ministers of State, are like the
						beames of the Sunne to the humane soule, and we may more truly say in vision politicall, then naturall, that the sensible, and intelligible Species of outward things,
						not well considered by others, are by the ayre transported to the soule, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0251" n="196"/>(that is to say to them who have the Supreme Authority) and therefore are they no lesse
						necessary to the preservation of the State, then the rayes of the light are to the conservation of man; or if they be compared to Spiders webs, which extended on all
						sides by the finest threds, doe warn them, keeping in their small holds, of all outward motions; They who bear Rule can no more know what is necessary to be commanded
						for the defence of their Subjects without <hi rend="italic">Spies</hi>, then those Spiders can when they shall goe forth, and whether they shall repair, without the
						motion of those threds. </p>
					<p> VIII. Farthermore, its necessarily requisite to the peoples defence, that they be <hi rend="italic">fore-armed</hi>. Now to be fore-armed is to be furnisht with
						Souldiers, Armes, Ships, Forts and Monies, before the danger be instant; for the listing of Souldiers, and taking up of Armes after a blow is given, is too late, at
						least if not impossible. In like manner, not to raise Forts, and appoint Garrisons in convenient places, before the Frontiers are invaded, is to be like those Country
						Swains (as <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes </hi>said) who ignorant of the art of Fencing, with their Bucklers guarded those parts of the body where they first felt the
						smart of the strokes. But they who think it then seasonable enough to raise Monies for the maintenance of Souldiers, and other Charges of War, when the danger begins to
						shew it self, they consider not surely how difficult a matter it is to wring suddainly out of close-fisted men so vast a proportion of Monies; for almost all men, <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0252" n="197"/>what
						they once reckon in the number of their goods, doe judge themselves to have such a right and propriety in it, as they conceive themselves to be injured whensoever they
						are forced to imploy but the least part of it for the publique good. Now a sufficient stock of monies to defend the Country with Armes, will not soon be raised out of
						the treasure of Imposts, and Customes; we must therefore, for fear of War, in time of Peace hoord up good summs, if we intend the safety of the Common-weal. Since
						therefore it necessarily belongs to Rulers for the Subjects safety to discover the Enemies Counsell, to keep Garrisons, and to have Money in continuall readinesse, and
						that Princes are by the Law of Nature bound to use their whole endeavour in procuring the welfare of their Subjects, it followes, that its not onely lawfull for them to
						send out Spies, to maintain Souldiers, to build Forts, and to require Monies for these purposes, but also, not to doe thus, is unlawfull. To which also may be added,
						whatsoever shall seeme to conduce to the lesning of the power of forraigners whom they suspect, whether by sleight, or force. For Rulers are bound according to their
						power to prevent the evills they suspect, lest peradventure they may happen through their negligence. </p>
					<p> IX. But many things are required to the conservation of inward Peace, because many things concur (as hath been shewed in the foregoing Chapter) to its perturbation.
						We have there shewed, that some things there are which dispose the minds <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0253" n="198"/>of men to sedition, others which move and quicken them so disposed. Among those which dispose
						them, we have reckoned in the first place certaine perverse doctrines. Its therefore the duty of those who have the chief Authority; to root those out of the mindes of
						men, not by commanding, but by teaching; not by the terrour of penalties, but by the perspicuity of reasons; the Lawes whereby this evill may be withstood are not to be
						made against the Persons erring, but against the Errours themselves. Those errours which in the foregoing Chapter we affirmed were inconsistent with the quiet of the
						Common-weal, have crept into the mindes of ignorant men, partly from the Pulpit, partly from the daily discourses of men, who by reason of little employment, otherwise,
						doe finde leasure enough to study; and they got into these mens mindes by the teachers of their youth in publique schooles. Wherefore also, on the other side, if any
						man would introduce sound Doctrine, he must begin from the <hi rend="italic">Academies</hi>: There, the true, and truly demonstrated foundations of civill Doctrine are
						to be laid, wherewith young men being once endued, they may afterward both in private and publique instruct the vulgar. And this they will doe so much the more
						cheerfully, and powerfully, by how much themselves shall be more certainly convinced of the truth of those things they profess, and teach; for seeing at this day men
						receive propositions, though false, and no more intelligible, then if a man should joyne together a company of termes <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0254" n="199"/>drawn by chance out of an urne, by reason of the
						frequent use of hearing them; how much more would they for the same reason entertain true doctrines suitable to their own understandings, and the nature of things? I
						therefore conceive it to be the duty of Supreme Officers to cause the true elements of civill Doctrine to be written, and to command them to be taught in all the
						Colledges of their severall Dominions. </p>
					<p> X. In the next place we shewed that grief of mind arising from <hi rend="italic">want </hi>did dispose the Subjects to Sedition, which want, although deriv'd from
						their own luxury, and sloth, yet they impute it to those who govern the Realm, as though they were drained and opprest by publique Pensions. Notwithstanding it may
						sometimes happen that this complaint may be just, namely, when the burthens of the Realm are unequally imposed on the Subjects; For that which to all together is but a
						light weight, if many withdraw themselves, it wil be very heavy, nay, even intollerable to the rest: Neither are men wont so much to grieve at the burthen it self, as
						at the inequality. With much earnestnes therefore men strive to be freed from taxes, &amp; in this conflict the lesse happy, as being overcome, do envy the more
						fortunate. To remove therefore all just complaint, its the interest of the publique quiet, and by consequence it concernes the duty of the Magistrate, to see that the
						publique burthens be equally born. Furthermore, since what is brought by the subjects to publick use, is nothing else but the price of their bought Peace, its reason
						good, that they who equally share in the peace, should also <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0255" n="200"/>pay an equall part either by contributing their Monies, or their labours to the Common-weal. Now it is the
						Law of Nature (by the 15. Article of the 3. Chapter) that every man in distributing right to others, doe carry himself equall to all; wherefore Rulers are by the
						naturall Law obliged to lay the burthens of the Common-weal equally on their Subjects. </p>
					<p> XI. Now in this place we understand an equality, not of Money, but of Burthen, that is to say, an equality of reason between the Burthens, and the Benefits. For
						although all equally enjoy Peace, yet the benefits springing from thence, are not equall to all; for some get greater possessions, others lesse; and againe, some
						consume lesse, others more. It may therefore be demanded whether Subjects ought to contribute to the publique, according to the rate of what they gain, or of what they
						spend, that is to say, whether the persons must be taxt, so as to pay contribution according to their wealth, or the goods themselves, that every man contribute
						according to what he spends. But if we consider, where Monies are raised according to wealth, there they who have made equall gain, have not equall possessions, because
						that one preserves what he hath got by frugality, another wastes it by luxury, and therefore equally rejoycing in the benefit of Peace, they doe not equally sustaine
						the Burthens of the Common-weal: and on the other side, where the goods themselves are taxt, there every man, while he spends his private goods, in the very act of
						consuming them he <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0256" n="201"/>undiscernably payes part due to the Common-weal, according to, not what he hath, but what by the benefit of the Realm he hath had. It is no more to be
						doubted, but that the former way of commanding monies is against equity, and therefore against the duty of Rulers, the latter is agreeable to reason, and the exercise
						of their authority. </p>
					<p> XII. In the third place, we said that that trouble of minde which riseth from <hi rend="italic">ambition </hi>was offensive to publique Peace. For there are some who
						seeming to themselves to be wiser then others, and more sufficient for the managing of affaires then they who at present doe govern, when they can no otherwise declare
						how profitable their vertue would prove to the Common-weale, they shew it, by harming it; but because ambition and greedinesse of honours cannot be rooted out of the
						mindes of men, its not the duty of Rulers to endeavour it; but by constant application of rewards, and punishments, they may so order it, that men may know that the way
						to honour is, not by contempt of the present government, nor by factions, and the popular ayre, but by the contraries. They are good men who observe the Decrees, the
						Lawes and Rights of their Fathers; if with a constant order we saw these adorned with honours, but the factious punisht, and had in contempt by those who bear command,
						there would be more ambition to obey, then withstand; notwithstanding it so happens sometimes, that as we must stroke a horse by reason of his too much fiercenesse, so
						a stiffe-neckt subject must be flatter'd for fear of his <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0257" n="202"/>power; but as that happens when the rider, so this, when the Commander is in danger of falling. But we speak
						here of those, whose authority and power is intire. Their duty (I say) it is to cherish obedient subjects, and to depresse the factious all they can; nor can the
						publique power be otherwise preserved, nor the subjects quiet without it. </p>
					<p> XIII. But if it be the duty of Princes to restrain the factious, much more does it concern them to dissolve and dissipate the factions themselves. Now I call a
						faction, a multitude of subjects gathered together, either by mutuall <hi rend="italic">contracts </hi>among themselves, or by the power of some one, without his or
						their authority who bear the supreme Rule: A <hi rend="italic">faction</hi> therefore is as it were a City in a City; for as by an Union of men in the state of nature a
						City receives its being, so by a new union of subjects, there ariseth a <hi rend="italic">faction</hi>. According to this definition, a multitude of subjects who have
						bound themselves simply to obey any forreign Prince, or Subject, or have made any Pacts, or Leagues of mutuall defence between themselves against all men, not excepting
						those who have the supreme power in the City, is a <hi rend="italic">faction</hi>. Also favour with the vulgar if it be so great, that by it an Army may be rais'd,
						except publique caution be given, either by hostages, or some other pledges, contains <hi rend="italic">faction </hi>in it; The same may be said of private wealth, if
						it exceed, because all things obey mony. Forasmuch therefore as it is true, that the state of Cities among themselves is naturall, and hostile, those Princes who permit
						factions, doe as much as if they <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0258" n="203"/>received an enemy within their walls, which is Contrary to the subjects safety, and therefore also against the Law of nature. </p>
					<p> XIV. There are two things necessary to the enriching of Subjects, <hi rend="italic">Labour </hi>and <hi rend="italic">thrift</hi>; there is also a third which helps,
						to wit the <hi rend="italic">naturall increase of the earth</hi> and <hi rend="italic">water</hi>; and there is a fourth too, namely the <hi rend="italic">Militia</hi>,
						which sometimes augments, but more frequently lessens the subjects stock. The two first are only necessary. For a City constituted in an Island of the Sea, no greater
						then will serve for dwelling, may grow rich without sowing, or fishing, by merchandize, and handicrafts only; but there is no doubt if they have a territory, but they
						may be richer with the same number, or equally rich, being a greater number. But the fourth, namely the Militia, was of old reckoned in the number of the gaining Arts,
						under the notion of <hi rend="italic">Booting </hi>or <hi rend="italic">taking prey</hi>; and it was by mankind, (disperst by families) before the constitution of
						civill societies, accounted just and honourable; for preying, is nothing else but a warre waged with small forces; And great Common-weales, namely that of <hi
							rend="italic">Rome</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Athens</hi>, by the spoyles of warre, forraigne tribute, and the territories they have purchased by their armes, have
						sometimes so improved the Common-wealth, that they have not onely not required any publique monies from the poorer sort of subjects, but have also divided to each of
						them both monies and lands. But this kind of increase of riches, is not to be brought into rule and fashion: For the Militia in order to profit, <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0259" n="204"/>is like a Dye wherewith
						many lose their estates, but few improve them. Since therefore there are three things only, the <hi rend="italic">fruits of the earth and water, Labour</hi> and <hi
							rend="italic">Thrift</hi>, which are expedient for the enriching of subjects, the duty of Commanders in chief, shall be conversant onely about those three. For the
						first, those lawes will be usefull which countenance the arts that improve the increase of the earth, and water, such as are <hi rend="italic">husbandry</hi>, and <hi
							rend="italic">fishing</hi>. For the second, all Lawes against idlenesse, and such as quicken industry, are profitable; the <hi rend="italic">art of Navigation</hi>
						(by help whereof the commodities of the whole world, bought almost by labour only, are brought into one City) and the <hi rend="italic">Mechanicks</hi>, (under which I
						comprehend all the arts of the most excellent workmen) and the <hi rend="italic">Mathematicall sciences</hi>, the fountains of navigatory and mechanick employments, are
						held in due esteem and honour. For the third, those lawes are usefull, whereby all inordinate expence, as well in meats, as in clothes, and universally in all things
						which are consumed with usage, is forbidden. Now because such lawes are beneficiall to the ends above specified, it belongs also to the Office of supreme Magistrates,
						to establish them. </p>
					<p> XV. The liberty of subjects consists not in being exempt from the Lawes of the City, or that they who have the supreme power cannot make what Laws they have a mind
						to; but because all the motions and actions of subjects, are never circumscribed by Lawes, nor can be, by reason of their variety, it is necessary that there be
						infinite <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0260" n="205"/>cases, which are neither commanded, nor prohibited, but every man may either doe, or not doe them, as he lists himselfe. In these, each man is said to enjoy
						his liberty, and in this sense liberty is to be understood in this place, namely, for that part of naturall Right, which is granted and left to Subjects by the civill
						Lawes. As water inclosed on all hands with banks, stands still and corrupts; having no bounds, it spreds too largely, and the more passages it findes, the more freely
						it takes its current; so subjects, if they might doe nothing without the commands of the Law would grow dull, and unwildly, if all, they would be disperst, and the more
						is left undetermined by the Lawes, the more liberty they enjoy. Both extremes are faulty, for Lawes were not invented to take away, but to direct mens actions, even as
						nature ordained the banks, not to stay, but to guide the course of the streame. The measure of this liberty is to be taken from the subjects, and the Cities good.
						Wherefore in the first place it is against the charge of those who command, and have the authority of making lawes, that there should be more lawes then necessarily
						serve for good of the Magistrate, and his Subjects; for since men are wont commonly to debate what to do, or not to do, by naturall reason, rather then any knowledge of
						the Lawes, where there are more Lawes then can easily be remembred, and whereby such things are forbidden, as reason of it selfe prohibites not of necessity, they must
						through ignorance, without the least evill intention, fall within the compasse of Lawes, as gins laid to <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0261" n="206"/>entrap their harmelesse liberty, which supreme Commanders are
						bound to preserve for their subjects by the Lawes of nature. </p>
					<p> XVI. It is a great part of that <hi rend="italic">liberty </hi>which is harmlesse to civill government, and necessary for each subject to live happily, that there be
						no penalties dreaded, but what they may both foresee, and look for. and this is done, where there are either no punishments at all defined by the Lawes, or greater not
						required then are defined. Where there are none defined, there he that hath first broken the Law, expects an indefinite or arbitrary punishment, and his feare is
						supposed boundlesse, because it relates to an unbounded evill; now the Law of nature commands them who are not subject to any civill Lawes, (by what we have said in the
						third Chapter, Artic. 11.) and therefore supreme Commanders, that in taking revenge and punishing, they must not so much regard the past evill, as the future good, and
						they sin, if they entertain any other measure in arbitrary punishment, then the publique benefit. But where the punishment is defined, either by a Law prescribed, as
						when it is set down in plain words, that <hi rend="italic">he that shall doe thus, or thus, shall suffer so and so</hi>; or by practice, as when the penalty, (not by
						any Law prescribed, but arbitrary from the beginning) is afterward determined by the punishment of the first. delinquent (for naturall equity commands that equall
						transgressors be equally punished); there to impose a greater penalty then is defined by the Law, is against the Law of nature. For the end of punishment is not to
						<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0262" n="207"/>compell the will of man, but to fashion it, &amp; make it such as he would have it who hath set the penalty. And deliberation is nothing else but a weighing, as it
						were in scales, the conveniencies, and inconveniencies of the fact we are attempting; where, that which is more weighty, doth necessarily according to its inclination
						prevaile with us. If therefore the Legislator doth set a lesse penalty on a crime, then will make our feare more considerable with us, then our lust; that excesse of
						lust above the feare of punishment, whereby sinne is committed, is to be attributed to the Legislator (that is to say) to the supreme; and therefore if he inflict a
						greater punishment, then himselfe hath determined in his Lawes, he punisheth that in another, in which he sinned himselfe. </p>
					<p> XVII. It pertaines therefore to the harmlesse and necessary <hi rend="italic">liberty </hi>of subjects, that every man may without feare, enjoy the rights which are
						allowed him by the Lawes; for it is in vain to have our own distinguisht by the Lawes from <hi rend="italic">anothers</hi>, if by wrong judgement; robbery, theft, they
						may bee again confounded. But it falls out so, that these doe happen where Judges are corrupted; for the fear whereby men are deterred from doing evill, ariseth not
						from hence, namely, because penalties are set, but because they are executed; for we esteeme the future by what is past, seldome expecting what seldome happens. If
						therefore Judges corrupted either by Gifts, Favour, or even by pitty it self, do often forbear the execution of the Penalties due by the Law, and by that meanes <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0263" n="208"/>put
						wicked men in hope to passe unpunisht: honest Subjects encompast with murtherers, theeves and knaves, will not have the liberty to converse freely with each other, nor
						scarce to stirre abroad without hazard; nay, the <hi rend="italic">City </hi>it self is dissolved, and every mans right of protecting himself at his own will returnes
						to him. The Law of Nature therefore gives this precept to Supreme Commanders, that they not onely doe righteousnesse themselves, but that they also by penalties cause
						the Judges, by them appointed, to doe the same; that is to say, that they hearken to the complaints of their Subjects; and as oft as need requires, make choice of some
						extraordinary Judges, who may hear the matter debated concerning the ordinary ones.</p>

					<p> I. They who lesse seriously consider the force of words, doe sometimes confound Law with <hi rend="italic">Counsell</hi>, sometimes with <hi rend="italic"
						>Covenant</hi>, sometimes with <hi rend="italic">Right</hi>. They confound <hi rend="italic">Law </hi>with <hi rend="italic">Counsell</hi>, who think, that it is the
						duty of Monarchs not onely to give ear to their <hi rend="italic">Counsellours</hi>, but also to obey them, as though it were in vaine to take <hi rend="italic"
							>Counsell</hi>, unlesse it were also followed. We must fetch the distinction between <hi rend="italic">Counsell</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Law</hi>, from the
						difference between <hi rend="italic">Counsell</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Command</hi>. Now COUNSELL is a <hi rend="italic">precept </hi>in which the reason of my
						obeying it, is taken from the <hi rend="italic">thing it self</hi> which is advised; but COMMAND is a <hi rend="italic">precept </hi>in which the cause of my obedience
						depends on <hi rend="italic">the will of the Commander</hi>. For it is not properly said, <hi rend="italic">Thus I will</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">thus I Command</hi>,
						except the will stand for a Reason. Now when obedience is yielded to the Lawes, not for the thing it self, but by reason of the advisers will, the Law is not a <hi
							rend="italic">Counsell</hi>, but a <hi rend="italic">Command</hi>, and is defined thus, LAW is the <hi rend="italic">command of that Person (whether Man, or Court)
							whose precept containes in it the reason of obedience</hi>; as the Precepts of God in regard of Men, of Magistrates in respect of their Subjects, and <pb
								entity="DSSR_000002537_0266" n="211"/>universally of
						all the powerfull in respect of them who cannot resist, may be termed their Lawes. <hi rend="italic">Law </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Counsell</hi> therefore differ many
						ways; <hi rend="italic">Law </hi>belongs to him who hath power over them <hi rend="italic">whom he adviseth, Counsell</hi> to them who have no power. To follow what is
						prescribed by <hi rend="italic">Law</hi>, is <hi rend="italic">duty</hi>, what by <hi rend="italic">Counsell</hi>, is <hi rend="italic">free-will</hi>. <hi
							rend="italic">Counsell </hi>is directed to his end that receives it, <hi rend="italic">Law</hi>, to his that <hi rend="italic">gives </hi>it. <hi rend="italic"
							>Counsell </hi>is given to none but the <hi rend="italic">willing</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Law </hi>even to the <hi rend="italic">unwilling</hi>. To conclude, the
						right of the <hi rend="italic">Counsellour </hi>is made void by the will of him to whom he gives <hi rend="italic">Counsell</hi>, the right of the <hi rend="italic"
							>Law-giver</hi> is not abrogated at the pleasure of him who hath a <hi rend="italic">Law </hi>imposed. </p>

								>&#x1F40;&mgr;&ogr;&lgr;&ogr;&ggr;&#x1F75;&mgr;&agr;&tgr;&agr;</hi>
						</foreign> or forms of living, determined by the common consent of men: Amongst whom is <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>, who defines <hi rend="italic">Law </hi>on this

						</foreign>, that is to say, <hi rend="italic">Law is a speech limited according to the common consent of the City, declaring every thing that we ought to doe</hi>.
						Which definition is not simply of <hi rend="italic">Law</hi>, but of the <hi rend="italic">Civill Law</hi> Law; for it is manifest that the <hi rend="italic">Divine
						Lawes</hi> sprang not from the consent of men, nor yet the <hi rend="italic">Lawes of Nature</hi>; for if they had their originall from the consent of men, they might
						also by the same consent be abrogated; but they are unchangeable. But indeed that's no right definition of a <hi rend="italic">Civill Law</hi>; for in that place a City
						is taken either for one civill person, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0267" n="212"/>having one will, or for a multitude of men who have each of them the liberty of their private wills. If for one person, those
						words, <hi rend="italic">common consent</hi>, are ill placed here, for one person hath no <hi rend="italic">common consent</hi>; neither ought he to have said, (<hi
							rend="italic">declaring </hi>what was needfull to be done) but <hi rend="italic">commanding</hi>; for what the City declares, it commands its Subjects. He therefore
						by a City understood a multitude of men declaring by common consent (imagine it a writing confirm'd by Votes) some certain formes of living; but these are nothing else
						but some mutuall contracts which oblige not any man (and therefore are no Lawes) before that a Supreme Power being constituted which can compell, have sufficient remedy
						against the rest, who otherwise are not likely to keep them. Lawes therefore, according to this definition of <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>, are nothing else, but
						naked, and weak contracts, which then at length, when there is one who by right doth exercise the Supreme Power, shall either <hi rend="italic">become Lawes, or no
							Lawes</hi>, at his will and pleasure: Wherefore he confounds <hi rend="italic">Contracts </hi>with <hi rend="italic">Lawes</hi>, which he ought not to have done; for
							<hi rend="italic">Contract is a promise, Law a command. In Contracts we say, I will do this; In Lawes, Doe this</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Contracts </hi>oblige us,
						Lawes <hi rend="italic">tie</hi> us fast, being obliged. A <hi rend="italic">Contract </hi>obligeth of <hi rend="italic">it self</hi>, The <hi rend="italic">Law</hi>
						holds the party obliged by vertue of the universall <hi rend="italic">Contract </hi>of yeelding obedience; Therefore in <hi rend="italic">Contract </hi>its first
						determined what is to be done, before we are obliged to doe it; But in <hi rend="italic">Law</hi> we are first obliged to performe, and what is to be <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0268" n="213"/>done, is
						determined afterwards. <hi rend="italic">Aristotle </hi>therefore ought to have defined a <hi rend="italic">civill law</hi> thus, <hi rend="italic">A civill law is a
							speech limited by the will of the City, commanding every thing behoofefull to be done,</hi> which is the same with that we have given above in the 6. Chap. art. 9. to
						wit, <hi rend="italic">that the civill lawes are the command of him </hi>(whether man, or Court of men) <hi rend="italic">who is endued with supreme Power in the city,
							concerning the future actions of his Subjects.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> Contracts oblige us. To be obliged, <hi rend="italic">and </hi>to be tyed being obliged, <hi rend="italic">seems to some men to be one, and the same thing, and that
							therefore here seems to be some distinction in words, but none indeed. More cleerly therefore, I say thus, That a man is obliged by his contracts, that is, that he
							ought to performe for his promise sake; but that the Law tyes him being obliged, that is to say, it compells him to make good his promise, for fear of the punishment
							appointed by the Law</hi>. </p>
					<p> III. They confound <hi rend="italic">Lawes </hi>with <hi rend="italic">Right</hi>, who continue still to doe what is permitted by <hi rend="italic">divine Right</hi>,
						notwithstanding it be forbidden by <hi rend="italic">the civill Law</hi>: That which is prohibited by the <hi rend="italic">divine Law</hi>, cannot bee permitted by the
							<hi rend="italic">civill</hi>, neither can that which is commanded by the <hi rend="italic">divine Law</hi>, be prohibited <hi rend="italic">by the civill</hi>.
						Notwithstanding that which is permitted by the divine Right, that is to say, that which may be done by <hi rend="italic">divine Right</hi>, doth no whit hinder why the
						same may not be forbidden by the <hi rend="italic">civill Lawes</hi>; for <hi rend="italic">inferiour Lawes</hi> may restrain the liberty allowed by the <hi
							rend="italic">superiour</hi>, although they cannot enlarge them. Now <hi rend="italic">naturall liberty is a Right</hi> not constituted, but allowed <pb
								entity="DSSR_000002537_0269" n="214"/>by the Lawes. For
						the <hi rend="italic">Lawes </hi>being removed, our <hi rend="italic">liberty </hi>is absolute; This is first restrained by the <hi rend="italic">naturall</hi>, and <hi
							rend="italic">divine Lawes</hi>, the residue is bounded by the <hi rend="italic">civill Law</hi>, and what remains may again be restrained by the <hi rend="italic"
							>constitutions </hi>of particular Towns, and Societies. There is great difference therefore between <hi rend="italic">Law</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Right</hi>; For
						Law is a <hi rend="italic">fetter</hi>, Right is <hi rend="italic">freedome</hi>, and they differ like contraries. </p>
					<p> IV. All Law may be divided, first according to the diversity of its Authors into <hi rend="italic">Divine </hi>and <hi rend="italic">humane</hi>. The <hi
							rend="italic">Divine</hi>, according to the two wayes whereby God hath made known his will unto men, is twofold, <hi rend="italic">naturall </hi>(or <hi rend="italic"
							>morall</hi>) and <hi rend="italic">positive</hi>; <hi rend="italic">naturall </hi>is that which God hath declared to all men by his <hi rend="italic">eternall
						word</hi> borne with them, to wit, their <hi rend="italic">naturall Reason</hi>; and this is that Law which in this whole book I have endeavoured to unfold. <hi
							rend="italic">Positive</hi> is that, which God hath revealed to us by <hi rend="italic">the word of Prophesie</hi>, wherein he hath spoken unto men as a man: Such are
						the Lawes which he gave to the <hi rend="italic">Jewes </hi>concerning their government, and divine worship, and they may be termed the <hi rend="italic">Divine civill
							Lawes</hi>, because they were peculiar to the civill government of the <hi rend="italic">Jewes</hi>, his peculiar people. Again, <hi rend="italic">the naturall Law
						</hi>may be divided into that of <hi rend="italic">Men</hi>, which alone hath obtained the title of <hi rend="italic">the Law of nature</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">that
							of Cities</hi>, which may be called <hi rend="italic">that of Nations</hi>, but vulgarly it is termed the <hi rend="italic">Right of Nations</hi>. The precepts of
						both are alike, but because Cities once instituted doe put on the personall proprieties of men, that <hi rend="italic">Law</hi>, which speaking of the duty of single
						<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0270" n="215"/>men, we call <hi rend="italic">naturall</hi>, being applyed to whole Cities, and Nations, is called the <hi rend="italic">Right of Nations</hi>. And the same Elements
						of <hi rend="italic">naturall law, and Right</hi>, which have hitherto been spoken of, being transferred to <hi rend="italic">whole Cities</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
							>Nations</hi>, may be taken for the Elements of the <hi rend="italic">lawes</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Right of Nations</hi>. </p>
					<p> V. All <hi rend="italic">humane law</hi> is <hi rend="italic">civill</hi>. For the state of men considered out of civill society, is hostile, in which, because one is
						not subject to another, there are no other Lawes, beside the dictates of naturall reason, which is the divine Law. But in civill government the City onely, that is to
						say, that man, or Court, to whom the supreme power of the City is committed, is the Legislator, and the Lawes of the City are civill. <hi rend="italic">The civill
						Lawes</hi> may be divided according to the diversity of their subject matter, into <hi rend="italic">sacred, or secular; sacred</hi> are those which pertain to
						Religion, that is to say, to the ceremonies, and worship of God (to wit what Persons, things, places, are to be consecrated, and in what fashion, what opinions
						concerning the Deity are to be taught publiquely, and with what words, and in what order supplications are to be made, and the like) and are not determined by any
						divine positive Law. For the <hi rend="italic">civill sacred Lawes</hi> are the <hi rend="italic">humane </hi>Lawes (which are also called <hi rend="italic"
							>Ecclesiasticall</hi>) concerning <hi rend="italic">things sacred</hi>; but <hi rend="italic">the secular</hi> under a generall notion, are usually called the <hi
							rend="italic">civill </hi>Lawes. </p>
					<p> VI. Again, the <hi rend="italic">civill Law</hi> (according to the two offices of the. Legislator, whereof one is to <hi rend="italic">judge</hi>; the other to <hi
						rend="italic">constrain men</hi><pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0271" n="216"/>" to acquiesce to his judgements) hath two parts; the one <hi rend="italic">distributive</hi>, the other <hi rend="italic"
						>vindicative</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">penall</hi>. By <hi rend="italic">the distributive</hi> it is, that every man hath his proper Right, that is to say, it sets
						forth Rules for all things, whereby we may know what is properly ours, what another mans; so as others may not hinder us from the free use and enjoyment of our own; and
						we may not interrupt others in the quiet possession of theirs; and what is lawfull for every man to doe or omit, and what is not lawfull. <hi rend="italic">Vindicative
						</hi>is that whereby it is defined what punishment shall be inflicted on them who break the Law. </p>
					<p> VII. Now <hi rend="italic">distributive</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">vindicative</hi>, are not two severall <hi rend="italic">Species </hi>of the Lawes, but two <hi
							rend="italic">parts </hi>of the same Law. For if the Law should say no more, but (for example) <hi rend="italic">whatsoever you take with your net in the Sea, be it
							yours</hi>, its in vain; For although another should take that away from you which you have caught, it hinders not, but that it still remains yours; for in the state
						of nature where all things are common to all, <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">others</hi>, are all one, insomuch as what the Law defines to be <hi
							rend="italic">yours</hi>, was <hi rend="italic">yours</hi> even before the Law, and after the Law ceases not to bee <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>, although in another
						mans possession. Wherefore the Law doth nothing, unlesse it bee understood to bee so <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>, as all other men be forbidden to interrupt your free
						use, and secure enjoyment of it at all times, according to your own will, and pleasure. For this is that which is required to a propriety of goods, not that a man may
						be able to use them, but to use them alone, which is done <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0272" n="217"/>by prohibiting others to be an hinderance to him. But in vain doe they also prohibit any men, who doe not
						withall strike a fear of punishment into them; in vain therefore is the Law, unlesse it contain both parts, that which <hi rend="italic">forbids </hi>injuries to be
						done, and that which <hi rend="italic">punisheth </hi>the doers of them. The first of them which is called <hi rend="italic">distributive</hi>, is <hi rend="italic"
							>Prohibitory</hi>, and speaks to all; the second which is styled <hi rend="italic">vindicative</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">paenary</hi>, is <hi rend="italic"
						>mandatory</hi>, and onely speaks to publique Ministers. </p>
					<p> VIII. From hence also we may understand, <hi rend="italic">that every civill Law hath a penalty annexed to it</hi>, either explicitly, or implicitly; For where the
						penalty is not defined, neither by any writing, nor by example of any one who hath suffered the punishment of the transgressed Law there the penalty is understood to be
						arbitrary, namely, to depend on the will of the Legislator, that is to say, of the supreme Commander. For in vain is that Law which may be broken without punishment. </p>
					<p> IX. Now because it comes from the civill Lawes, both that every man have <hi rend="italic">his proper Right</hi>, and distinguisht from <hi rend="italic"
						>anothers</hi>, and also that he is forbidden to invade anothers Rights, it followes, that these Precepts ( <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt not refuse to give the honour
							defin'd by the Lawes unto thy Parents: Thou shalt not kill the man whom the Lawes forbid thee to kill: Thou shalt avoid all copulation forbidden by the Laws: Thou
							shalt not take away anothers goods against the Lords will: Thou shalt not frustrate the Laws and Judgements by false testimony</hi>) are Civill Lawes. The naturall
						Lawes command the same things but <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0273" n="218"/>implicitly. for the law of nature (as hath been said in the 3. Chap. Art. 2.) commands us to keep <hi rend="italic">contracts</hi>,
						and therefore also to performe obedience when we have covenanted obedience, and to abstaine from anothers goods when it is determin'd by the civill Law what belongs to
						another. But all Subjects (by the 13. Art. of the 6. Chap.) do <hi rend="italic">covenant </hi>to obey his commands who hath the supreme power, that is to say the
						civill Lawes, in the very constitution of government, even before it is possible to break them. For the Law of nature did oblige in the state of nature, where first
						(because nature hath given all things to all men) nothing did properly belong to another, and therefore it was not possible to invade anothers right; next, where all
						things were common, and therefore all carnall copulations lawfull; Thirdly, where was the state of Warre, and therefore lawfull to kill; Fourthly, where all things were
						determined by every mans own judgement, and therefore paternall respects also: Lastly, where there were no publique judgements, and therefore no use of bearing
						witnesse, either true, or false. </p>
					<p> X. Seeing therefore our obligation to observe those Laws, is more ancient then the promulgation of the Laws themselves, as being contained in the very constitution of
						the City, by the vertue of the naturall Law which forbids breach of Covenant, the Law of nature commands us to keep all the civill Laws; for where we are tyed to
						obedience, before we know what will be commanded us, there we are universally tyed to <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0274" n="219"/>obey in all things. Whence it followes, that no civil Law whatsoever, which tends
						not to a reproach of the Deity (in respect of whom, Cities themselves have no right of their own, and cannot be said to make Lawes) can possibly be against the Law of
						nature; for though the Law of nature forbid theft, adultery, &amp;amp;c. yet if the civill Law command us to invade any thing, that invasion is not theft, adultery,
						&amp;amp;c. For when the Lacedemonians of old permitted their youths by a certaine Law, to take away other mens goods, they commanded that these goods should not
						bee accounted other mens, but their own who took them; and therefore such surreptions were no thefts. In like manner, copulations of heathen Sexes, according to their
						Lawes, were lawfull marriages. </p>
					<p> XI. Its necessary to the essence of a Law, that the Subjects be acquainted with two things, First, what man or Court hath the supreme power, that is to say, the Right
						of making Lawes. Secondly, what the Law it self sayes; for he that neither knew either to whom or what he is tyed to, cannot obey, and by consequence is in such a
						condition, as if he were not tyed at all. I say not that it is necessary to the essence of a Law, that either one, or the other be perpetually known, but onely that it
						be once knowne; and if the Subject afterward forget either the Right he hath who made the Law, or the Law it self, that makes him no lesse tyed to obey, since he might
						have remembred it, had he had a will to obey. </p>
					<p> XII. <hi rend="italic">The knowledge of the Legislator</hi> <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0275" n="220"/>depends on the Subject himselfe; for the right of making Lawes could not be conferr'd on any man without
						his owne consent, and covenant, either exprest, or suppos'd; exprest, when from the beginning the Citizens doe themselves constitute a forme of governing the City, or
						when by promise they submit themselves to the Dominion of any one; or suppos'd at least, as when they make use of the benefit of the Realme, and Lawes, for their
						protection and conservation against others. For to whose Dominion we require our fellow Subjects to yeeld obedience for our good, his Dominion we acknowledge to be
						legitimate by that very request. And therefore ignorance of the power of making Lawes, can never be a sufficient excuse; for every man knowes what he hath done
						himselfe. </p>
					<p> XIII. <hi rend="italic">The knowledge of the lawes</hi> depends on the Legislator, who must publish them, for otherwise they are not Lawes; for Law is the command of
						the Law-maker, and his command is the Declaration of his Will; it is not therefore a Law, except the will of the Law-maker be declar'd, which is done by <hi
							rend="italic">promulgation</hi>. Now in <hi rend="italic">promulgation </hi>two things must be manifest, whereof one is, that he or they who publish a Law, either
						have a right themselves to make Lawes, or that they doe it by authority deriv'd from him or them who have it; the other is the sense of the Law it selfe. Now, that the
						first, namely publisht Lawes proceed from him who hath the supreme command, cannot be manifest (speaking exactly and philosophically) to any, but them who have <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0276" n="221"/>received
						them from the mouth of the Commander; the rest beleeve, but the reasons of their beliefe are so many, that it is scarce possible they should not believe. And truly in a
							<hi rend="italic">Democratical </hi>City where every one may be present at the making of Laws if he will, he that shall be absent, must beleeve those that were
						present; but in <hi rend="italic">Monarchies</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aristocraties</hi>, because its granted but to few to be present, and openly to heare the
						commands of the <hi rend="italic">Monarch </hi>or the <hi rend="italic">Nobles</hi>, it was necessary to bestow a power on those few of publishing them to the rest. And
						thus we beleeve those to be the <hi rend="italic">Edicts </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Decrees </hi>of Princes, which are propounded to us for such, either by the
						writings, or voices of them, whose office it is to publish them. But yet when we have these causes of beliefe, that we have seen the Prince, or supreme Councell
						constantly use such <hi rend="italic">Counsellors, Secretaries, publishers,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">seales</hi>, and the like arguments for the declaring of his
						will; that he never took any authority from them; that they have bin punisht who not giving credit to such like promulgations have transgrest the Law; not onely he who
						thus believing shall not obey the <hi rend="italic">Edicts </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Decrees</hi> set forth by them is every where accus'd, but he that not believing,
						shall not yield obedience, is punisht. For the constant permission of these things is a manifest signe enough, and evident declaration of the Commanders will; provided
						there be nothing contain'd in the Law, <hi rend="italic">Edict </hi>or <hi rend="italic">Decree</hi>, derogatory from his supreme power: For it is not to be imagin'd
						that he would have ought taken from his power by any of <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0277" n="222"/>his Officers as long as he retaines a will to governe. Now the <hi rend="italic">sense </hi>of the <hi
							rend="italic">law</hi>, when there is any doubt made of it, is to be taken from them to whom the supreme authority hath committed the <hi rend="italic">knowledge of
							causes</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Judgements</hi>; for to <hi rend="italic">judge </hi>is nothing else then by <hi rend="italic">interpretation</hi> to apply the <hi
							rend="italic">lawes </hi>to particular cases. Now we may know who they are that have this Office granted them, in the same manner, as we know who they be that have
						authority given them to publish Laws. </p>
					<p> XIV. Againe the <hi rend="italic">civill law</hi> according to its two fold manner of publishing, is of two sorts, <hi rend="italic">written </hi>&amp; <hi
							rend="italic">unwritten</hi>; By <hi rend="italic">written</hi>, I understand that which wants a voice, or some other signe of the will of the Legislator that it may
						become. a Law. For all kind of Laws are of the same age with mankinde, both in nature, and time, and therefore of more antiquity then the invention of letters, and the
						Art of writing. Wherefore not a <hi rend="italic">writing</hi>, but a <hi rend="italic">voice </hi>is necessary for a <hi rend="italic">written law</hi>. this alone is
						requisite to <hi rend="italic">the being</hi>, that to the <hi rend="italic">Remembrance </hi>of a Law; for we reade, that before letters were found out for the help of
						memory, that <hi rend="italic">Lawes</hi> contracted into Meetre, were wont to be sung. <hi rend="italic">The unwritten</hi> is that which wants no other publishing
						then the voice of nature, or naturall reason; such are the <hi rend="italic">lawes of nature</hi>. For the naturall Law although it be distinguisht from the civill, for
						as much as it commands the Will, yet so farre forth as it relates to our actions it is civill; for example, this same, <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt not covet</hi>,
						which onely appertaines to the minde, is a naturall Law, onely. but this, <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt not invade</hi>, is both <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0278" n="223"/>naturall and civill. For seeing it is
						impossible to prescribe such universall Rules, whereby all future contentions which perhaps are infinite, may be determined, its to be understood that in all cases not
						mentioned by the <hi rend="italic">written lawes</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">law of naturall equity</hi> is to be followed, which commands us to distribute equally to
						equals; and this by the vertue of the <hi rend="italic">civill law</hi>, which also punisheth those who knowingly and willingly doe actually transgresse the <hi
							rend="italic">lawes of nature</hi>. </p>
					<p> XV. These things being understood, it appeares first, That the <hi rend="italic">Lawes of Nature</hi>, although they were describ'd in the Books of some Philosophers,
						are not for that reason to be termed <hi rend="italic">Written lawes</hi>: and that the Writings of the Interpreters of the Lawes, were no Lawes, for want of the
						Supreme Authority; nor yet those <hi rend="italic">orations of the Wise</hi>, (that is to say) <hi rend="italic">Judges</hi>, but so farre forth as by the consent of
						the Supreme power they part into custome; and that then they are to be received among <hi rend="italic">the Written lawes</hi>, not for the Customes sake (which by its
						own force doth not constitute a Law) but for the Will of the Supreme Commander, which appeares in this, that he hath suffer'd his <hi rend="italic">Sentence</hi>,
						whether equall, or unequall, to passe into custome. </p>
					<p> XVI. <hi rend="italic">Sinne</hi>, in its largest signification, comprehends every <hi rend="italic">deed</hi>, <hi rend="italic">word </hi>and <hi rend="italic"
							>thought</hi>, against right reason. For every man by reasoning seeks out the meanes to the end which he propounds to himselfe. If therefore he reason right (that is
						to say, beginning from most evident principles, he makes <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0279" n="224"/>a discourse out of consequences continually necessary,) he will proceede in a most direct way; otherwise hee'l
						goe astray, that is to say, he will either <hi rend="italic">doe, say</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">endeavour</hi>, somewhat against his proper end: which when he hath
						done, he will indeed in reasoning be said to have <hi rend="italic">erred</hi>, but in action and will to have <hi rend="italic">sinned</hi>; for <hi rend="italic"
						>sin</hi> followes <hi rend="italic">errour</hi>, just as the <hi rend="italic">Will </hi>doth the <hi rend="italic">understanding</hi>: And this is the most generall
						acception of the word, under which is contain'd every <hi rend="italic">imprudent </hi>action, whether against the Law, as to overthrow another mans house, or not
						against the Law, as to build his owne upon the Sand. </p>
					<p> XVII. But when we speak of <hi rend="italic">the Lawes</hi>, the word <hi rend="italic">Sinne </hi>is taken in a more strict sense, and signifies not every thing done
						against right reason, but that onely which is <hi rend="italic">blameable</hi>, and therefore is call'd <foreign lang="lat">
							<hi rend="italic">malum culpae</hi>
						</foreign>, the evill of fault; but yet if any thing be culpable it is not presently to be term'd <hi rend="italic">a sinne</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">fault</hi>, but
						onely if it be blameable with reason. We must therefore enquire what is to be <hi rend="italic">blameable with reason</hi>, what against reason. Such is the nature of
						man, that every one calls that <hi rend="italic">good </hi>which he desires, and <hi rend="italic">evill </hi>which he eschewes; and therefore through the diversity of
						our affections, it happens that one counts that <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, which another counts <hi rend="italic">evill</hi>; and the same man what now he esteem'd
						for <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, he immediately looks on as <hi rend="italic">evill</hi>; and the same thing which he calls <hi rend="italic">good </hi>in himselfe, he
						tearmes <hi rend="italic">evill </hi>in another. For we all measure <hi rend="italic">good </hi>and <hi rend="italic">evill </hi>by the pleasure or paine we either
						feele at present, or expect hereafter.<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0280" n="225"/> Now seeing the prosperous actions of enemies (because they increase their honours, goods, and power) and of equalls, (by reason
						of that strife of honours which is among them) both seeme and are <hi rend="italic">irkesome</hi>, and therefore <hi rend="italic">evill </hi>to all; and men use to
						repute those <hi rend="italic">evill</hi>, that is to say, to <hi rend="italic">lay some fault</hi> to their charge from whom they receive <hi rend="italic">evill</hi>;
						its impossible to be determined by the consent of single men whom the same things doe not please and displease, what actions are, and what not to be blam'd. They may
						agree indeed in some certaine generall things, as that <hi rend="italic">theft, adultery</hi>, and the like are <hi rend="italic">sinnes</hi>, as if they should say
						that all men account those things <hi rend="italic">evill </hi>to which they have given names which are usually taken in an <hi rend="italic">evill </hi>sense; but we
						demand not whether theft be a Sinne, but what is to be term'd theft, and so concerning other in like manner. For as much therefore as in so great a diversity of
						censurers, what is by reason blameable, is not to bee measur'd by the reason of one man more then another, because of the equality of humane nature, and there are no
						other reasons in being, but onely those of <hi rend="italic">particular men</hi>, and that of the <hi rend="italic">City</hi>, it followes, that the <hi rend="italic"
							>City</hi> is to determine what <hi rend="italic">with reason is culpable</hi>: So as a <hi rend="italic">fault</hi>, that is to say, a <hi rend="italic">SINNE</hi>,
						is that, which a man do's, omits, sayes, or wills, against the reason of <hi rend="italic">the City</hi>, that is, contrary to the Lawes. </p>
					<p> XVIII. But a man may doe somewhat against the Lawes through humane infirmity, although he desire to fulfill them, and yet his action as being against the Lawes, <pb
						entity="DSSR_000002537_0281" n="226"/>is
						rightly blam'd, and call'd <hi rend="italic">a Sinne</hi>. But there are some, <hi rend="italic">who neglect</hi> the Lawes, and as oft as any hope of gain and impunity
						doth appear to them, no conscience of contracts and betrothed faith can withhold them from their violation. Not only the deeds, but even the mindes of these men are
						against the Lawes. They who sinne onely through infirmity, are <hi rend="italic">good men</hi> even when they sinne; but these even when they doe not sin, are <hi
							rend="italic">wicked</hi>. For though both the action, and the mind be repugnant to the Lawes, yet those repugnancies are distinguisht by different appellations, for
						the irregularity of the action is called <foreign lang="gre">
							<hi rend="italic">&#x1F00;&dgr;&#x1F77;&kgr;&egr;&mgr;&agr;</hi>
						</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">unjust deed</hi>; that of the mind <foreign lang="gre">
							<hi rend="italic">&#x1F00;&dgr;&igr;&kgr;&#x1F77;&agr;</hi>
						</foreign>, and <foreign lang="gre">
							<hi rend="italic">&kgr;&agr;&kgr;&#x1F77;&agr;</hi>
						</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">injustice</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">malice</hi>; that is, the <hi rend="italic">infirmity </hi>of a disturbed soule, this the <hi
							rend="italic">pravity </hi>of a sober mind. </p>
					<p> XIX. But seeing there is no sin which is not against some Law, and that there is no Law which is not the command of him who hath the supreme power, and that no man
						hath a supreme power which is not bestowed on him by our own consent; in what manner will he be said to sinne, who either denies that there is a God, or that he governs
						the world, or casts any other reproach upon him? For he will say, <hi rend="italic">that he never submitted his will to Gods will, not conceiving him so much as to have
							any being. And granting that his opinion were erroneous, and therefore also a sin, yet were it to be numbred among those of imprudence or ignorance, which by right
							cannot be punished</hi>. This speech seems so farre forth to be admitted, that though this kind of sin be the greatest and <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0282" n="227"/>most hurtful, yet is it to be refer'd to
						sins of imprudence; but that it should be excused by imprudence or ignorance, is absurd. For the Atheist is punisht either immediately by God himselfe, or by Kings
						constituted under God; not as a Subject is punished by a King, because he keeps not the Lawes, but as one enemy by another, because he would not accept of the Lawes;
						that is to say, by the Right of warre, as the Giants warring against God: For whosoever are not subject either to some common Lord, or one to another, are enemies among
						themselves. </p>
					<p> (Yet is it to be referred to sins of imprudence)<hi rend="italic"> Many find fault that I have referr'd Atheisme to imprudence, and not to injustice; yea by some it
							is taken so, as if I had not declared my selfe an enemy bitter enough against Atheists: They object farther, that since I had elsewhere said that it might be
						knowne</hi> there is a God,<hi rend="italic"> by naturall reason, I ought to have acknowledged that they sin at least against the Law of nature, and therefore are not
							only guilty of imprudence, but injustice too. But I am so much an enemy to Atheists, that I have both diligently sought for, and vehemently desired to find some Law
							whereby I might condemne them of injustice; but when I found none, I enquired next what name God himselfe did give to men so detested by him. Now God speaks thus of
							the Atheist</hi>: The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God. <hi rend="italic">Wherefore I placed their sinne in that rank which God himselfe referres to;
							next, I shew them to be enemies of God. But I conceive the name of an enemy to be sometimes somewhat sharper, then that of an unjust man. Lastly, I affirme that they
							may under that <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0283" n="228"/>notion be justly punisht both by God, and supreme Magistrates, and therefore by no meanes excuse or extenuate this sinne. Now that I have said that it
							might be known by naturall reason </hi>that there is a God,<hi rend="italic"> is so to be understood, not as if I had meant that all men might know this, except they
							think that because </hi>Archimedes <hi rend="italic">by naturall reason found out what proportion the circle hath to the square, it followes thence, that every one of
							the vulgar could have found out as much. I say therefore, that although it may be knowne to some by the light of reason that there is a God, yet men that are
							continually engaged in pleasures, or seeking of riches and honour, also men that are not wont to reason aright, or cannot do it, or care not to doe it, lastly, fools,
							in which number are Atheists, cannot know this.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> XX. Seeing that from the vertue of the Covenant whereby each Subject is tyed to the other to perform absolute and universall obedience (such as is defined above Chap.
						6. art. 13.) to the City, that is to say, to the Soveraign power, whether that be one man or Councel, there is an obligation derived to observe each one of the civill
						Lawes, so that that Covenant contains in it self all the Laws at once; it is manifest that the subject who shall renounce the generall Covenant of obedience, doth at
						once renounce all the Lawes. Which trespasse is so much worse then any other one sinne, by how much to sinne <hi rend="italic">alwayes</hi>, is worse then to sinne <hi
							rend="italic">once</hi>. And this is that sin which is called <hi rend="italic">TREASON</hi>; and it is a word or deed whereby the Citizen, or Subject, declares that
						he will no longer obey that man or Court to whom the supreme power of the City is entrusted,<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0284" n="229"/> and the Subject declares this same will of his by deed, when he either
						doth, or endeavours to do violence to the Soveraigns Person, or to them who execute his commands; of which sort are Traytors, Regicides, and such as take up armes
						against the City, or during a warre, flye to the enemies side. And they shew the same will in word, who flatly deny that themselves or other subjects are tyed to any
						such kind of obedience, either in the whole, as he who should say that wee must not obey him (keeping the obedience which we owe to God intire) simply, absolutely, and
						universally; or in part, as he who should say, that he had no Right to wage warre at his own will, to make Peace, list souldiers, levie monies, electing Magistrates,
						and publique Ministers, enacting Lawes, deciding controversies, setting penalties, or doing ought else, without which the State cannot stand. And these and the like
						words and deeds are Treason by the naturall, not the civill Law. But it may so happen, that some action which before the civill Law was made, was not Treason, yet will
						become such, if it be done afterwards. As if it be declared by the Law, that it shall be accounted for a sign of renouncing publique obedience (that is to say for
						Treason) if any man shall coyn monies, or forge the Privie Seale, he that after that Declaration shall doe this, will be no lesse guilty of Treason then the other. Yet
						he sinnes lesse, because he breakes not all the Laws at once, but one Law only; for the Law by calling that Treason which by nature is not so, doth indeed by Right set
						a more <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0285" n="230"/>odious name, and perhaps a more grievous punishment on the guilty persons, but it makes not the sinne it selfe more grievous. </p>
					<p> XXI. But that sinne which by the Law of nature is Treason, is a Transgression of the naturall, not the civill Law. For since our obligation to civill obedience, by
						vertue whereof the civill Lawes are valid, is before all civill Law, and the sin of Treason is naturally nothing else but the breach of that obligation; it followes
						that by the sin of Treason, that Law is broken which preceded the civill Law, to wit, the naturall, which forbids us to violate Covenants, and betrothed faith. But if
						some Soveraign Prince should set forth a Law on this manner, <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt not rebell</hi>, he would effect just nothing: For except Subjects were before
						obliged to obedience, that is to say, not to rebell, all Law is of no force; now the obligation which obligeth to what we were before obliged to, is superfluous. </p>
					<p> XXII. Hence it followes, that <hi rend="italic">Rebels, Traytors</hi>, and all <hi rend="italic">others convicted of Treason</hi>, are punisht not by <hi
							rend="italic">civill</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">naturall </hi>Right; that is to say, not as <hi rend="italic">civill Subjects</hi>, but as <hi rend="italic">Enemies
							to the Government</hi>, not by the <hi rend="italic">Right of Soveraignty</hi>, and Dominion, but by the <hi rend="italic">Right of Warre</hi>. </p>
					<p> XXIII. There are some who think that those acts which are done against the Law, when the punishment is determined by the Law it selfe, are expiated, if the punished
						willingly undergoe the punishment; and that they are not guilty before God of breaking the naturall Law (although by breaking the civill Lawes, we break the <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0286" n="231"/>naturall
						too, which command us to keep the civill) who have suffered the punishment which the Law required; as if by the Law, the fact were not prohibited, but a punishment were
						set instead of a price, whereby a licence might be bought of doing what the Law forbids. By the same reason they might inferre too, that no transgression of the Law
						were a sin, but that every man might enjoy the liberty which he hath bought by his own perill. But we must know that the words of the Law may be understood in a twofold
						sense, the one as containing two parts (as hath been declared above in the seventh Art.) namely that of absolutely prohibiting, as, <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt not doe
							this</hi>; and revenging, as, <hi rend="italic">he that doth this, shall be punisht</hi>; The other, as containing a condition, for example, <hi rend="italic">Thou
							shalt not doe this thing, unlesse thou wilt suffer punishment</hi>; and thus, the Law forbids not simply, but conditionally. If it be understood in the first sense,
						he that doth it, sins, because he doth what the Law forbids to be done; if in the second, he sins not, because he cannot be said to doe what is forbidden him, that
						performs the condition; For in the first sense, all men are forbidden to doe it; in the second, they only who keep themselves from the punishment. In the first sense,
						the vindicative part of the Law obligeth not the guilty, but the Magistrate to require punishment; in the second, he himselfe that owes the punishment is obliged to
						exact it, to the payment whereof, if it be capitall, or otherwise grievous, he cannot be obliged. But in what sense the Law is to be taken, depends on the will of him
						<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0287" n="232"/>who hath the Soveraignty. When there is therefore any doubt of the meaning of the Law, since we are sure they sinne not who doe it not, it will be sin if we doe it,
						howsoever the Law may afterward be explained; for so to doe that which a man doubts whether it be a sin or not, when he hath freedome to forbear it, is a contempt of
						the Lawes, and therefore by the 28. Art. of the third Chapter, a sin against the Law of nature. Vain therefore is that same distinction of <hi rend="italic">obedience
						</hi>into <hi rend="italic">Active </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Passive</hi>, as if that could be expiated by penalties constituted by humane decrees, which is a sinne
						against the Law of nature, which is the Law of God; or as though they sinned not, who sinne at their own perill.<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0288" n="233"/></p>

					<p>XIX.  What Sin is in the naturall Kingdom of God; and what Treason against the divine Majesty.</p>
					<lb/>
					<p> I. Wee have already in the foregoing Chapters, proved both by reason, and testimonies of holy Writ, that the estate of nature, that is to say, of absolute liberty,
						such as is theirs, who neither govern, nor are governed, is an Anarchy, or hostile state; that the precepts whereby to avoyd this state, are <hi rend="italic">the Lawes
							of nature</hi>; that there can be no <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0292" n="237"/>civill government without a Soveraigne; and that they who have gotten this Soveraigne command must be obey'd simply, that is to
						say, in all things which repugne not the Commandments of God: There is this one thing only wanting to the complete understanding of all civill duty, &amp; that is,
						to know which are the Laws and Commandments of God. For else we cannot tell whether that which the civill power commands us, be against the Lawes of God, or not; whence
						it must necessarily happen, that either by too much obedience to the civill authority, we become stubborne against the divine Majesty; or for feare of sinning against
						God, we runne into disobedience against the civill power: To avoid both these rocks, its necessary to know the Divine Lawes. now because the knowledge of the Lawes,
						depends on the knowledge of the Kingdome, we must in what followes, speak somewhat concerning the <hi rend="italic">Kingdome of God</hi>. </p>
					<p> II. <hi rend="italic">The Lord is King, the earth may be glad there of saith the Psalmist, Psal</hi>: 97 v. 1. And againe the same Psalmist, <hi rend="italic"
						>Psal</hi>. 99. v. 1. <hi rend="italic">The Lord is King, be the People never so unpatient; he sitteth betweene the</hi> Cherubins, <hi rend="italic">be the Earth never
							so unquiet</hi>; to wit, whether men will, or not, God is <hi rend="italic">THE</hi> King over all the Earth, nor is he mov'd from his Throne, if there be any who
						deny either his existence, or his <hi rend="italic">providence</hi>. Now although God governe all men so by his power, that none can doe any thing which he would not
						have done, yet this, to speake properly, and accurately, is not to reigne, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0293" n="238"/>for he is sayed to reigne, who rules not by <hi rend="italic">acting</hi>, but <hi
							rend="italic">speaking</hi>, that is to say, by <hi rend="italic">precepts</hi> and <hi rend="italic">threatnings</hi>. And therefore we account not inanimate, nor
						irrationall bodies, for Subjects in the Kingdome of God, although they be subordinate to the Divine power; because they <hi rend="italic">understand not the
						commands</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">threats </hi>of God; nor yet the <hi rend="italic">Atheists</hi>, because they beleeve not that there is a God; nor yet those who
						beleeving there is a God, doe not yet beleeve that he rules these Inferiour things; for even these, although they be govern'd by the power of God, yet doe they not
						acknowledge any of his <hi rend="italic">Commands</hi>, nor stand in awe of his threats. Those onely therefore are suppos'd to belong to Gods Kingdome, who acknowledge
						him to be the Governour of all things, and that he hath <hi rend="italic">given his Commands</hi> to men, and <hi rend="italic">appointed punishments</hi> for the
						transgressours; The rest, we must not call Subjects, but Enemies of God. </p>
					<p> III. But none are said to governe by <hi rend="italic">commands</hi>, but they who openly declare them to those who are govern'd by them; for the <hi rend="italic"
							>Commands </hi>of the Rulers are the <hi rend="italic">Lawes </hi>of the Rul'd, but lawes they are not, if not perspicuously publisht, in so much as all excuse of
						Ignorance may be taken away. Men indeed publish their Lawes by <hi rend="italic">word </hi>or <hi rend="italic">voice</hi>, neither can they make their will universally
						knowne any other way; But Gods <hi rend="italic">lawes </hi>are declar'd after a threefold manner: first, <hi rend="italic">by the tacit dictates of Right reason</hi>:
						next, by <hi rend="italic">immediate revelation</hi>, which is suppos'd to be done either by <hi rend="italic">a supernaturall voice</hi>, or by a <hi rend="italic"
							>vision </hi>or <hi rend="italic">dreame</hi>, or <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0294" n="239"/>divine <hi rend="italic">inspiration</hi>: Thirdly, by the <hi rend="italic">voice of one man</hi> whom God
						recommends to the rest, as worthy of beliefe, by the working of true miracles. Now he whose voice God thus makes use of to signifie his will unto others, is called a
							<hi rend="italic">PROPHET</hi>. These three manners may be term'd the threefold <hi rend="italic">word of God</hi>, to wit the <hi rend="italic">Rationall word</hi>,
						the <hi rend="italic">sensible word</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">the word of Prophecy</hi>: To which answer, the three manners whereby we are said to heare God, <hi
							rend="italic">Right reasoning, sense</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">faith</hi>. Gods <hi rend="italic">sensible word</hi> hath come but to few; neither hath God spoken
						to men by Revelation except particularly to some, and to diverse diversely; neither have any Lawes of his Kingdome beene publisht on this manner unto any people. </p>
					<p> IV. And according to the difference which is between the <hi rend="italic">Rationall word</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">word of Prophecy</hi>, we attribute a twofold
						Kingdome unto God: <hi rend="italic">Naturall</hi>, in which he reignes by the dictates of right reason, and which is universall over all who acknowledge the Divine
						power, by reason of that rationall nature which is common to all; and <hi rend="italic">Propheticall</hi>, in which he rules also by the <hi rend="italic">word of
							Prophecy</hi>, which is peculiar, because he hath not given positive Lawes to all men, but to his peculiar people, and some certaine men elected by him. </p>
					<p> V. God in his <hi rend="italic">naturall Kingdome</hi> hath a Right to rule, and to punish those who break his Lawes, from his sole <hi rend="italic">irresistable
							power</hi>. For all Right over others is either from <hi rend="italic">nature</hi>, or from <hi rend="italic">Contract</hi>. How the Right of governing springs from
						<hi rend="italic">Contract</hi>, we have already shewed in the 6. Chapter. <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0295" n="240"/>And the same Right is derived from nature, in this very thing, that it is not by <hi
							rend="italic">nature</hi> taken away. For when by nature all men had a Right over all things, every man had a Right of ruling over all as ancient as nature it selfe;
						but the reason why this was abolisht among men, was no other but mutuall fear; as hath been declared above in the second Chapter, the 3. art; reason namely dictating
						that they must foregoe that Right for the preservation of mankinde, because the equality of men among themselves according to their strength and naturall powers was
						necessarily accompanied with warre, and with warre joynes the destruction of mankinde. Now if any man had so farre exceeded the rest in power, that all of them with
						joyned forces could not have resisted him, there had been no cause why he should part with that Right which nature had given him; The Right therefore of Dominion over
						all the rest, would have remained with him, by reason of that excesse of power whereby he could have preserved both himselfe and them. They therefore whose power cannot
						be resisted, and by consequence God <hi rend="italic">Almighty</hi>, derives his Right of Soveraignty from the <hi rend="italic">power </hi>it selfe. And as oft as God
						punisheth, or slayes a sinner, although he therefore punish him because he sinned, yet may we not say that he could not justly have punisht or killed him although he
						had not sinned. Neither, if the will of God in punishing, may perhaps have regard to some sin antecedent, doth it therefore follow, that the Right of afflicting, and
						killing, depends not on divine Power, but on <hi rend="italic">mens sins</hi>. <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0296" n="241"/></p>
					<p> VI. That question made famous by the disputations of the Antients, <hi rend="italic">why evill things befell the good, and good things the evill</hi>, is the same
						with this of ours, <hi rend="italic">by what Right God dispenseth good and evill things unto men</hi>. And with its difficulty, it not only staggers the faith of the
						vulgar concerning the divine providence, but also of Philosophers, and which is more, even of holy men. <hi rend="italic">Psal</hi>. 73. v. 1, 2, 3. <hi rend="italic"
							>Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart. but as for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well nigh slipt. And why? I was grieved at
							the wicked, I doe also see the ungodly in such prosperity</hi>. And how bitterly did <hi rend="italic">Job </hi>expostulate with God, that being just, he should yet
						be afflicted with so many calamities? God himselfe with open voyce resolved this difficulty in the case of <hi rend="italic">Job</hi>, and hath confirmed his Right by
						arguments drawn not from <hi rend="italic">Jobs </hi>sinne, but from his own power. For <hi rend="italic">Job </hi>and his friends had argued so among themselves, that
						they would needs make him guilty, because he was punisht; and he would reprove their accusation by arguments fetcht from his own innocence: But God when he had heard
						both him and them, refutes his expostulation, not by condemning him of injustice, or any sin, but by declaring his own power, <hi rend="italic">Job</hi>. 38. v. 4. <hi
							rend="italic">Where wast thou</hi> (sayes he) <hi rend="italic">when I laid the foundation of the earth,</hi> &amp;amp;c. And for his friends, God pronounces
						himself angry against them, <hi rend="italic">Job</hi>. 42. v. 7.<hi rend="italic"> Because they had not spoken of him the thing that is right, like his servant</hi>
						Job. Agreeable to this is that speech of our Saviours in the mans case who was born blind, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0297" n="242"/>when, his Disciples asking him whether he or his Parents had sinned, that he
						was born blind, he answered, <hi rend="italic">John </hi>9. v. 3. <hi rend="italic">Neither hath this man sinned, nor his Parents, but that the works of God should be
							manifest in him</hi>. For though it be said, Rom. 5. 12. <hi rend="italic">That death entred into the world by sinne</hi>, it followes not, but that God by his Right
						might have made men subject to diseases, and death, although they had never sinned, even as he hath made the other animalls mortall, and sickly, although they cannot
						sinne. </p>
					<p> VII. Now if God have the Right of Soveraignty from his power, it is manifest, that the <hi rend="italic">obligation </hi>of yeelding him obedience lyes on men by
						reason of their weaknesse; for that <hi rend="italic">obligation</hi> which rises from Contract, of which we have spoken in the second Chapter, can have no place here,
						where the Right of Ruling (no Covenant passing between) rises only from nature. But there are two Species of <hi rend="italic">naturall obligation</hi>, one when
						liberty is taken away by corporall impediments, according to which we say that heaven and earth, and all Creatures, doe obey the common Lawes of their Creation: The
						other when it is taken away by hope, or fear, according to which the weaker despairing of his own power to resist, cannot but yeeld to the stronger. From this last
						kinde of obligation, that is to say from fear, or conscience of our own weaknesse (in respect of the divine power) it comes to passe, that we are obliged to obey God in
						his naturall Kingdome; reason dictating to all, acknowledging the divine power and providence, <hi rend="italic">that there is no <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0298" n="243"/>kicking against the pricks</hi>. </p>
					<p> (By reason of their weaknesse)<hi rend="italic"> If this shall seem hard to any man, I desire him with a silent thought to consider, if there were two Omnipotents,
							whether were bound to obey; I beleeve he will confesse that neither is bound: if this be true, then it is also true what I have set down, that men are subject unto
							God because they are not omnipotent. And truly our Saviour admonishing </hi>Paul (<hi rend="italic">who at that time was an enemy to the Church) that he should not
							kick against the pricks, seems to require obedience from him for this cause, because he had not Power enough to resist</hi>. </p>
					<p> VIII. Because the <hi rend="italic">word of God</hi> ruling by nature onely, is supposed to be nothing else but right reason, and the Laws of Kings can be known by
						their <hi rend="italic">word </hi>only, its manifest that the Laws of God ruling by nature alone, are onely the <hi rend="italic">naturall Lawes</hi>; namely those
						which we have set down in the second and third Chapters, and deduced from the dictates of reason, <hi rend="italic">Humility, Equity, Justice, Mercy</hi>, and other <hi
							rend="italic">Morall vertues</hi> befriending <hi rend="italic">Peace</hi>, which pertain to the discharge of the duties of men one toward the other, and those which
						right reason shall dictate besides, concerning the honour and worship of the Divine Majesty. We need not repeat what those <hi rend="italic">Naturall Laws</hi>, or <hi
							rend="italic">Morall vertues</hi> are; but we must see what honours, and what divine worship, that is to say, what <hi rend="italic">sacred Lawes</hi>, the same
						naturall reason doth dictate. </p>
					<p> IX. Honour, to speak properly, is nothing else but an opinion of anothers <hi rend="italic">power </hi>joyned with <hi rend="italic">goodnesse</hi>; and to <hi
						rend="italic">honour </hi>a man, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0299" n="244"/>is the same with highly esteeming him, and so honour is not in the Party <hi rend="italic">honoured</hi>, but in the <hi
							rend="italic">honourer</hi>. Now three Passions do necessarily follow <hi rend="italic">honour </hi>thus placed in opinion; <hi rend="italic">Love</hi>, which
						referres to <hi rend="italic">goodnesse; hope</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">feare</hi>, which regard <hi rend="italic">power</hi>. And from these arise all outward
						actions, wherewith the powerfull are appeased, and become Propitious, and which are the effects, and therefore also the naturall signes of honour it selfe. But the word
							<hi rend="italic">honour </hi>is transferred also to those outward effects of <hi rend="italic">honour</hi>, in which sense, we are said to honour him, of whose power
						we testifie our selves, either in word, or deed, to have a very great respect; insomuch as <hi rend="italic">honour </hi>is the same with <hi rend="italic"
						>worship</hi>. Now <hi rend="italic">WORSHIP </hi>is an outward act, the sign of inward honour. and whom we endeavour by our homage to appease, if they be, angry or
						howsoever to make them favourable to us, we are said to <hi rend="italic">worship</hi>. </p>
					<p> X. All signes of the mind are either <hi rend="italic">words </hi>or <hi rend="italic">deeds</hi>, and therefore all worship consists either in <hi rend="italic"
							>words </hi>or <hi rend="italic">deeds</hi>. Now both the one and the other are referred to three kindes; whereof the first is <hi rend="italic">Praise</hi>, or <hi
							rend="italic">publique declaration of goodnesse</hi>; The second, a <hi rend="italic">publique declaration of present power</hi>, which is to <hi rend="italic"
							>magnify </hi><foreign lang="gre">
							<hi rend="italic">&amp;mgr;&amp;egr;&amp;ggr;&amp;#x03AC;&amp;lgr;&amp;ugr;&amp;ngr;&amp;sgr;&amp;igr;&amp;#x03C2;</hi>
						</foreign>; The third, is a <hi rend="italic">publique declaration of happinesse</hi>, or of <hi rend="italic">power</hi>, <hi rend="italic">secure also for the
						future</hi>, which is called, <foreign lang="gre">
							<hi rend="italic">&amp;mgr;&amp;agr;&amp;kgr;&amp;agr;&amp;rgr;&amp;igr;&amp;sgr;&amp;mgr;&amp;#x03cc;&amp;#x03C2;</hi>
						</foreign>. I say, that all kindes of honour may be discerned, not in <hi rend="italic">words </hi>only, but in <hi rend="italic">deeds </hi>too. But we then <hi
							rend="italic">praise</hi>, and celebrate in <hi rend="italic">words</hi>, when we doe it by way of Proposition, or <hi rend="italic">Dogmatically</hi>, that is to say
						by <hi rend="italic">Attributes</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Titles</hi>, which may be termed praysing, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0300" n="245"/>celebrating, <hi rend="italic">categorically</hi>, and <hi
							rend="italic">plainly</hi>, as when we declare him whom we honour to be <hi rend="italic">liberall, strong, wise</hi>; And then, in <hi rend="italic">deeds</hi>, when
						it is done by <hi rend="italic">consequence</hi>, or by <hi rend="italic">hypothesis</hi>, or supposition, as by <hi rend="italic">Thanksgiving</hi>, which supposeth
							<hi rend="italic">goodnesse</hi>; or by <hi rend="italic">Obedience</hi>, which supposeth <hi rend="italic">power</hi>. or by <hi rend="italic">Congratulation</hi>,
						which supposeth happinesse; </p>
					<p> XI. Now whether we desire to praise a man in <hi rend="italic">words</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">deeds</hi>, we shall find some things which signify honour with all
						men, such as among <hi rend="italic">attributes</hi>, are the generall words of <hi rend="italic">vertues </hi>and <hi rend="italic">powers</hi>, which cannot be taken
						in ill sense, As <hi rend="italic">Good, Faire, Strong, Just</hi>, and the like; and among <hi rend="italic">actions, Obedience, Thanksgiving, Prayers,</hi> and others
						of that kinde, by which an acknowledgement of vertue and power is ever understood: Others, which signify honour, but with some, and scorne with others, or else neither;
						such as in <hi rend="italic">Attributes</hi>, are those words which according to the diversity of opinions, are diversly referred to vertues or vices, to honest or
						dishonest things; As that a man slew his enemy, that he fled, that he is a Philosopher, or an Orator, and the like, which with some are had in honour, with others in
						contempt. In <hi rend="italic">deeds</hi>, such as depend on the custome of the place, or prescriptions of civill Lawes, as in saluting to be bareheaded, to put off the
						shoes, to bend the body. to petition for any thing, and the like. Now standing, prostrate, kneeling, forms of ceremony, that worship which is alwayes, and by all men
						accounted honourable, may be called <hi rend="italic">Naturall</hi>; the other, which followes places, and customes, <hi rend="italic">Arbitrary</hi>. <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0301" n="246"/></p>
					<p> XII. Furthermore, <hi rend="italic">worship </hi>may be enjoyned, to wit by the <hi rend="italic">command </hi>of him that is worshiped, and it may bee <hi
							rend="italic">voluntary</hi>, namely such as seems good to the worshipper: If it be <hi rend="italic">enjoyned</hi>, the actions expressing it, do not signify honour,
						as they signify actions, but as they are <hi rend="italic">enjoyned</hi>: for they signify <hi rend="italic">obedience</hi> immediately, <hi rend="italic">obedience
							power</hi>; insomuch as <hi rend="italic">worship enjoyned</hi> consists in obedience. <hi rend="italic">Voluntary </hi>is honourable onely in the nature of the
						actions, which if they doe signify honour to the beholders, it is <hi rend="italic">worship</hi>, if not, it is <hi rend="italic">Reproach</hi>. Again <hi rend="italic"
							>worship</hi> may be either <hi rend="italic">publique </hi>or <hi rend="italic">private</hi>. But <hi rend="italic">publique</hi>, respecting each single worshipper,
						may not be <hi rend="italic">voluntary</hi>; respecting the City it may. For seeing that which is done voluntarily, depends on the will of the Doer, there would not one
						worship be given, but as many worships as worshippers, except the will of all men were united by the command, of one. But <hi rend="italic">Private </hi>worship may be
							<hi rend="italic">voluntary</hi>, if it be done secretly; for what is done openly is restrained, either by Lawes, or through modesty, which is contrary to the nature
						of a <hi rend="italic">voluntary </hi>action. </p>
					<p> XIII. Now that we may know what the <hi rend="italic">scope </hi>and <hi rend="italic">end </hi>of <hi rend="italic">worshipping </hi>others is, we must consider the
						cause why men delight in worship: And we must grant what we have shewed elsewhere, that <hi rend="italic">Joy </hi>consists in this, that a man contemplate vertue,
						strength, science, beauty, friends, or any <hi rend="italic">power </hi>whatsoever, as being, or as though it were his own; and it is nothing else but a <hi
							rend="italic">Glory</hi>, or Triumph of the mind conceiving it selfe honoured, that is to say, lov'd and fear'd, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0302" n="247"/>that is to say, having the services and assistances
						of men in readinesse. Now because men beleeve him to be powerfull whom they see honoured (that is to say) esteemed powerfull by others, it falls out that honour is
						increased by worship; and by the opinion of power, true power is acquired. His <hi rend="italic">end </hi>therefore who either commands, or suffers himself to be
						worshipt, is, that by this means he may acquire as many as he can, either through love, or fear, to be obedient unto him. </p>
					<p> XIV. But that we may understand what manner of <hi rend="italic">Worship </hi>of God <hi rend="italic">naturall reason</hi> doth assigne us, let us begin from his <hi
							rend="italic">Attributes</hi>: where, first it is manifest, that <hi rend="italic">existence </hi>is to be allowed him; for there can be no will to honour him, who,
						we think, hath no being. Next, those Philosophers who said, that God was the World, or the worlds Soul, (that is to say, a part of it) spake unworthily of God, for they
						attribute nothing to him, but wholly deny his being. For by the word <hi rend="italic">God </hi>we understand the <hi rend="italic">Worlds </hi><hi rend="italic"
						>cause</hi>; but in saying that the <hi rend="italic">World is God</hi>, they say, <hi rend="italic">that it hath no cause</hi>, that is as much, as <hi rend="italic"
							>there is no God</hi>. In like manner, they who maintain the world not to be created, but eternall; because there can be no cause of an eternall thing, In denying <hi
							rend="italic">the world to have a Cause</hi>, they deny also <hi rend="italic">that there is a God</hi>. They also have a wretched apprehension of God, who imputing
						idlenesse to him, doe take from him the Government of the world, and of mankind. For say they should acknowledge him omnipotent, yet if he minde not these inferiour
						things, that same thred bare Sentence<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0303" n="248"/>" will take place with them, <foreign lang="lat">
							<hi rend="italic">Quod supra nos, nihil ad nos</hi>
						</foreign>; What is above us, doth not concern us. And seeing there is nothing for which they should either love, or fear him, truly he will be to them as though he
						were not at all. Moreover in <hi rend="italic">Attributes </hi>which signifie <hi rend="italic">Greatnesse</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Power</hi>, those which signifie
						some finite, or limited thing, are not signes at all of an honouring mind. For we honour not God worthily if we ascribe lesse <hi rend="italic">power</hi>, or <hi
							rend="italic">greatnesse </hi>to him then possibly we can; but every finite thing is lesse then we can, for most easily we may alwayes assigne and attribute more to a
						finite thing; No <hi rend="italic">shape </hi>therefore must be assigned to God, for all <hi rend="italic">shape </hi>is <hi rend="italic">finite</hi>; nor must he be
						said to be conceived, or comprehended by imagination, or any other faculty of our soul; for whatsoever we conceive is <hi rend="italic">finite</hi>: And although this
						word <hi rend="italic">Infinite </hi>signifie a conception of the mind, yet it followes not, that we have any conception of an <hi rend="italic">infinite thing</hi>:
						For when we say that a thing is <hi rend="italic">infinite</hi>, we signifie nothing really, but the impotency in our owne mind, as if we should say we know not
						whether, or where it is limited: Neither speak they honourably enough of God, who say we have an <hi rend="italic">Idea </hi>of him in our mind; for an Idea is our
						conception, but conception we have none, except of a <hi rend="italic">finite </hi>thing: Nor they, who say that he hath <hi rend="italic">Parts</hi>, or that he is
						some certaine <hi rend="italic">intire </hi>thing; which are also attributes of <hi rend="italic">finite </hi>things: Nor that he is in any place; for nothing can be
						said to be in a <hi rend="italic">place</hi>, but what hath <hi rend="italic">bounds </hi>and limits of its greatnesse on <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0304" n="249"/>all sides: Nor that he is <hi rend="italic"
							>moved</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">is at rest</hi>; for either of them suppose a <hi rend="italic">being in some place</hi>: Nor that there are more Gods; because not
						more infinites. Farthermore concerning <hi rend="italic">attributes of happinesse</hi>, those are unworthy of God which signify <hi rend="italic">sorrow </hi>(unlesse
						they be taken not for any Passion, but by a Metonomy for the effect) such as <hi rend="italic">Repentance, anger, Pity</hi>: Or <hi rend="italic">Want</hi>, as <hi
							rend="italic">Appetite, Hope, Concupiscence</hi>, and that <hi rend="italic">love </hi>which is also called <hi rend="italic">lust</hi>, for they are signes of <hi
							rend="italic">Poverty</hi>, since it cannot be understood, that a man should <hi rend="italic">desire, hope</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">wish </hi>for ought, but what
						he <hi rend="italic">wants </hi>and <hi rend="italic">stands in need of</hi>. Or <hi rend="italic">any Passive faculty</hi>; for <hi rend="italic">suffering
						</hi>belongs to a limited power, and which depends upon another. When we therefore attribute a <hi rend="italic">will </hi>to God, it is not to be conceived like unto
						ours, which is called <hi rend="italic">a rationall desire</hi>; for if God <hi rend="italic">desires</hi>, he <hi rend="italic">wants</hi>, which for any man to say,
						is a contumelie; but we must suppose some resemblance which we cannot conceive. In like manner when wee attribute <hi rend="italic">sight </hi>and other <hi
							rend="italic">acts of the senses</hi> to him, or <hi rend="italic">knowledge</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">understanding</hi>, which in us are nothing else but a tumult
						of the minde raised from outward objects pressing the Organes, wee must not think that any such thing befalls the Deity; for it is a signe of power <hi rend="italic"
							>depending </hi>upon some other, which is not the most blessed thing. He therefore who would not ascribe any other titles to God, then what reason commands, must use
						such as are either <hi rend="italic">Negative</hi>, as <hi rend="italic">infinite, eternall, incomprehensible</hi>, &amp;amp;c. or <hi rend="italic"
						>superlative</hi>, as <hi rend="italic">most good, most great, most powerfull</hi>, &amp;amp;c. or <hi rend="italic">Indefinite</hi>, as <hi rend="italic">good,
							just, strong, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0305" n="250"/>Creatour, King</hi>, and the like; in such sense, as not desiring to declare what he is (which were to circumscribe him within the narrow limits of our
						phantasie), but to confesse our own admiration, and obedience, which is the property of humility, and of a minde yeelding all the honour it possibly can doe. For Reason
						dictates one name alone, which doth signify the <hi rend="italic">nature </hi>of God (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Existent</hi>, or simply, <hi
							rend="italic">that he is</hi>; and one in <hi rend="italic">order </hi>to, and in <hi rend="italic">relation </hi>to us, namely <hi rend="italic">God</hi>, under
						which is contained both <hi rend="italic">King</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Father</hi>. </p>
					<p> XV. Concerning the <hi rend="italic">outward actions</hi> wherewith God is to be worshipped (as also concerning his <hi rend="italic">Titles</hi>) its a most generall
						command of Reason, that they be signes of a mind yeelding honour; under which are contained in the first place, Prayers;<lb/>
						<foreign lang="lat">
							<hi rend="italic">Qui fingit sacros auro, vel marmore vultus,<lb/> Non facit ille Deos, qui rogat, ille facit.</hi>
						</foreign><lb/>
					</p>
					<p> For <hi rend="italic">Prayers </hi>are the signes of hope, and hope is an acknowledgement of the divine <hi rend="italic">power</hi>, or <hi rend="italic"
						>goodnesse</hi>. </p>
					<p> In the second place, <hi rend="italic">Thanksgiving</hi>; which is a signe of the same affection, but that <hi rend="italic">prayers goe before</hi> the benefit, and
							<hi rend="italic">thanks follow it</hi>. </p>
					<p> In the third, <hi rend="italic">Guifts</hi>, that is to say <hi rend="italic">oblations </hi>and <hi rend="italic">sacrifices</hi>, for these are <hi rend="italic"
							>thanksgivings</hi>. </p>
					<p> In the fourth, <hi rend="italic">not to sweare by any other</hi>. For a mans Oath is an, Imprecation of his wrath against him if he deceive, who both knowes whether
						he doe, or not, and can punish him if he doe, though he be never so powerfull; which only belongs to God: for if there were any man from whom his subjects <hi
							rend="italic">malice </hi>could not lye hid, and whom <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0306" n="251"/>no humane power could resist, plighted faith would suffice without swearing, which, broken, might be punisht by
						that Man; and for this very reason there would be no need of an Oath. </p>
					<p> In the fifth place, <hi rend="italic">To speak warily of God</hi>; for that is a sign of <hi rend="italic">fear</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">feare </hi>is an
						acknowledgement of <hi rend="italic">power</hi>. It followes from this precept: <hi rend="italic">That we may not take the name of God in vain, or use it rashly</hi>;
						for either are inconsiderate. <hi rend="italic">That wee must not swear where there is no need</hi>; for that is in vain; but need there is none, unlesse it be between
						Cities to avoyd or take away contention by force, which necessarily must arise, where there is no faith kept in promises, or in a City, for the better certainty of
						Judicature. Also, <hi rend="italic">That we must not dispute of the Divine nature</hi>: For it is supposed <hi rend="italic">that all things in the naturall Kingdom of
							God are enquired into by reason only</hi>, that is to say, out of the Principles of naturall Science; but we are so far off by these to attain to the knowledge of the
						nature of God, that we cannot so much as reach to the full understanding of all the qualities of our own bodies, or of any other Creatures. Wherefore there comes
						nothing from these disputes, but a rash imposition of names to the divine Majesty, according to the small measure of our conceptions. It followes also (which belongs to
						the Right of Gods Kingdome) that their speech is inconsiderate, and rash, who say, <hi rend="italic">That this, or that, doth not stand with divine justice</hi>; for
						even men count it an affront that their children should dispute their Right, or measure their justice otherwise then by <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0307" n="252"/>the rule of their Commands. </p>
					<p> In the sixth. W<hi rend="italic">hatsoever is offered up in Prayers, thanksgivings, and sacrifices, must in its kind be the best, and most betokening honour</hi>;
						namely, Prayers must not be rash, or light, or vulgar, but beautifull, and well composed. </p>
					<p> For though it were absurd in the Heathen to worship God in an image, yet was it not against reason to use Poetry, and Musick, in their Churches. </p>
					<p> Also <hi rend="italic">Oblations must be clean, and Presents sumptuous</hi>, and such as are significative either of submission, or gratitude, or commemorative of
						benefits received; for all these proceed from a desire of honouring. </p>
					<p> In the seventh. <hi rend="italic">That God must be worshipt not privately onely, but openly, and publiquely in the sight of all men</hi>; because that worship is so
						much more acceptable, by how much it begets honour, and esteem in others (as hath been declared before in the 13. art.). Unlesse others therefore see it, that which is
						most pleasing in our worship, vanisheth. </p>
					<p> In the last place. <hi rend="italic">That we use our best endeavour to keep the Lawes of Nature</hi>. For the undervaluing of our Masters command, exceeds all other
						affronts whatsoever; as on the other side, Obedience is more acceptable then all other sacrifices. And these are principally the naturall Lawes concerning the worship
						of God, those I mean which Reason dictates to every Man; but to whole Cities, every one whereof is one Person, the same naturall Reason farther commands an <hi
							rend="italic">uniformity of publique worship</hi>. For the actions done by particular Persons, according to their private Reasons, are not the Cities <pb
								entity="DSSR_000002537_0308" n="253"/>actions, and
						therefore not the Cities worship; but what is done by the City, is understood to be done by the command of him, or them who have the Soveraignty, wherefore also
						together with the consent of all the subjects, that is to say, <hi rend="italic">Uniformly</hi>. </p>
					<p> XVI. The <hi rend="italic">naturall Lawes</hi> set down in the foregoing Article concerning the divine worship, only command the giving of naturall signes of honour;
						but we must consider that there are two kindes of signes, the one <hi rend="italic">naturall</hi>, the other done upon <hi rend="italic">agreement</hi>, or by expresse,
						or tacite composition. Now because in every language, the use of <hi rend="italic">words</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">names</hi>, come by appointment, it may also by
						appointment be altered; for that which depends on, and derives its force from the will of men, can by the will of the same men agreeing be changed again, or abolisht.
						Such <hi rend="italic">names</hi> therefore as are <hi rend="italic">attributed </hi>to God by the appointment of men, can by the same appointment be taken away; now
						what can be done by the appointment of men, that the City may doe; The City therefore by Right (that is to say, they who have the power of the whole City) shall judge
						what <hi rend="italic">names </hi>or <hi rend="italic">appellations </hi>are more, what lesse <hi rend="italic">honourable </hi>for God, that is to say, what doctrines
						are to be held and profest concerning the nature of God, and his operations. Now actions doe signify not by mens appointment, but naturally, even as the effects are
						signes of their causes; whereof some are alwayes signes of Scorn to them before whom they are committed, as those, whereby the bodies uncleannesse is discovered, and
						whatsoever men are ashamed to <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0309" n="254"/>doe before those whom they respect; Others are alwayes signes of honour, as to draw near, and discourse decently and humbly, to give way,
						or to yeeld in any matter of private benefit: In these actions the City can alter nothing. But there are infinite others, which, as much as belongs to honour, or
						reproach, are indifferent; now these, by the institution of the City, may both be made signes of honour, and being made so, doe in very deed become so. From whence we
						may understand, that we must obey the City in whatsoever it shall command to be used for a sign of honouring God, that is to say, for <hi rend="italic">Worship</hi>;
						provided it can be instituted for a sign of honour, because that is a sign of honour, which by the Cities command is us'd for such. </p>
					<p> XVII. We have already declared which were the Laws of God, as wel sacred as secular, in his government by the way of Nature onely. Now because there is no man but may
						be deceived in reasoning, and that it so falls out, that men are of different opinions concerning the most actions, it may be demanded farther, whom God would have to
						be the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter of right Reason</hi>, that is to say, of his Lawes. And as for the <hi rend="italic">Secular Lawes</hi>, I mean those which concern
						justice, and the carriage of men towards men; by what hath been said before of the constitution of a City, we have demonstratively shewed it agreeable to reason, that
						all <hi rend="italic">Judicature </hi>belongs to the City, and that <hi rend="italic">Judicature </hi>is nothing else but an <hi rend="italic">Interpretation of the
							Laws</hi>, and by consequence, that everywhere Cities, that is to say, those who have <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0310" n="255"/>the Soveraign power, are the <hi rend="italic">Interpreters of the Lawes</hi>.
						As for the <hi rend="italic">Sacred Lawes</hi>, we must consider what hath been before demonstrated in the fifth Chap. the 13. art. that every Subject hath transferr'd
						as much right as he could on him, or them, who had the supreme authority, but he could have transferred his right of judging the manner how God is to be honoured, and
						therefore also he hath done it; That he could, it appeares hence, that the manner of honouring God before the constitution of a City was to be fetcht from every mans
							<hi rend="italic">private Reason</hi>; but every man can subject his <hi rend="italic">private Reason to the Reason of the whole City</hi>. Moreover, if each Man
						should follow his own reason in the <hi rend="italic">worshipping </hi>of God, in so great a diversity of worshippers, one would be apt to judge anothers worship
						uncomely, or impious; neither would the one seem to the other to honour God: Even that therefore which were most consonant to reason, would not be a worship, because
						that the nature of <hi rend="italic">worship </hi>consists in this, that it be the <hi rend="italic">sign of inward honour</hi>; but there is no sign but whereby
						somewhat becomes known to others, and therefore is there no sign of honour but what seems so to others. Again, that's a true sign which by the consent of men becomes a
						sign; therefore also that is honourable, which by the consent of men, that is to say, by the command of the City, becomes a sign of honour. It is not therefore against
						the will of God, declared by the way of reason onely, to give him such signs of honour as the City shall command; wherefore Subjects can transferre their <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0311" n="256"/>Right of
						judging the manner of Gods worship on him or them who have the Soveraign power. Nay, they must doe it, for else all manner of absurd opinions, concerning the nature of
						God, and all ridiculous ceremonies which have been used by any Nations, will bee seen at once in the same, City. whence it will fall out, that every man will beleeve
						that all the rest doe offer God an affront; so that it cannot be truly said of any that he worships God; for no man worships God, that is to say, honours him outwardly,
						but he who doth those things, whereby hee appeares to others for to honour him. It may therefore bee concluded, that the <hi rend="italic">Interpretation </hi>of all
						Lawes, as well <hi rend="italic">Sacred</hi>, as <hi rend="italic">Secular</hi>, (God ruling by the way of <hi rend="italic">nature </hi>only) depends on the authority
						of the City, that is to say, that man, or councell, to whom the Soveraign power is committed; and that whatsoever God commands, he commands by his voyce. And on the
						other side, that whatsoever is commanded by them, both concerning the manner of honouring God, and concerning secular affaires, is commanded by God himselfe. </p>
					<p> XVIII. Against this, some Man may demand, first, Whether it doth not follow, that the City must be obeyed if it command us directly to affront God, or forbid us to
						worship him? I say, it does not follow, neither must we obey. For to affront, or not to worship at all, cannot by any Man be understood for a manner of worshipping;
						neither also had any one, before the constitution of a City, of those who acknowledge God to rule, a Right to deny <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0312" n="257"/>him the honour which was then due unto him; nor could
						he therefore transfer a Right on the City of commanding any such things. Next, if it be demanded whether the City must be obeyed if it command somewhat to be said, or
						done, which is not a disgrace to God directly, but from whence by reasoning disgracefull consequences may be derived: as for example, if it were commanded to worship
						God in an image, before those who account that honourable? Truly it is to be done. For Worship is instituted in signe of Honour; but to Worship him thus, is a signe of
						honour, and increaseth Gods Honour among those who do so account of it. Or if it be commanded to call God by a name which we know not what it signifies, or how it can
						agree with this word, <hi rend="italic">God</hi>? That also must be done; for what we do for Honours sake, (and we know no better), if it be taken for a signe of
						Honour, it is a signe of Honour; and therefore if we refuse to doe it, we refuse the enlarging of Gods Honour. The same judgement must be had of all the <hi
							rend="italic">Attributes </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Actions </hi>about the meerly rationall Worship of God which may be controverted, and disputed; for though these
						kind of commands may be sometimes contrary to right reason, and therefore sins in them who command them, yet are they not against right reason, nor sins in Subjects,
						whose right reason in points of Controversie is that, which submits its selfe to the reason of the City. Lastly, if that Man, or Councell, who hath the Supreme Power,
						command himselfe to <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0313" n="258"/>be Worshipt with the same <hi rend="italic">Attributes</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Actions</hi>, wherewith God is to be Worshipt, the question is,
						whether we must obey? There are many things which may be commonly attributed both to God, and Men; for even Men may be <hi rend="italic">Praised</hi>, and <hi
							rend="italic">Magnified</hi>; and there are many actions whereby God, and Men, may be Worshipt. But the significations of the <hi rend="italic">Attributes</hi>, and
							<hi rend="italic">Actions</hi>, are onely to be regarded: Those <hi rend="italic">Attributes </hi>therefore, whereby we signify our selves to be of an opinion, that
						there is any man endued with a Soveraignty independent from God, or that he is immortall, or of infinite power, and the like, though commanded by Princes, yet must they
						be abstained from. As also from those <hi rend="italic">Actions </hi>signifying the same, as Prayer to the absent; to aske those things which God alone can give, as
						Rain, and Fair weather; to offer him what God can onely accept, as Oblations, Holocausts; or to give a Worship, then which a greater cannot be given, as Sacrifice. For
						these things seeme to tend to this end, that God may not be thought to rule, contrary to what was supposed from the beginning. But genuflection, prostration, or any
						other act of the body whatsoever, may be lawfully used even in civill Worship. for they may signifie an acknowledgment of the civill power onely; for Divine Worship is
						distinguisht from civill, not by the motion, placing, habit, or gesture of the Body, but by the declaration of our opinion of him whom we doe Worship; as if we cast
						down our selves before any man, with intention of declaring by <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0314" n="259"/>that Signe that we esteeme him as God, it is Divine Worship; if we doe the same thing as a Signe of our
						acknowledgment of the civill Power, it is civill Worship. Neither is the <hi rend="italic">Divine Worship</hi> distinguished from <hi rend="italic">Civill </hi>by any
						action usually understood by the words <foreign lang="gre">
							<hi rend="italic"> &amp;lgr;&amp;agr;&amp;tgr;&amp;rgr;&amp;egr;&amp;#x1F77;&amp;agr;</hi>
						</foreign> and <foreign lang="gre">
							<hi rend="italic">&amp;dgr;&amp;ogr;&amp;ugr;&amp;lgr;&amp;egr;&amp;#x1F77;&amp;agr;</hi>
						</foreign>, whereof the former marking out the Duty of Servants, the latter their <hi rend="italic">Destiny</hi>, they are words of the same action in degree. </p>
					<p> Truly it is to be done] <hi rend="italic">We said in the </hi>14. <hi rend="italic">Article of this Chapter, That they who attributed limits to God, transgrest the
							naturall Law concerning Gods Worship. Now they who worship him in an Image, assigne him limits; wherefore they doe that which they ought not to doe, and this place
							seemes to contradict the former. We must therefore know first, that they who are constrained by Authority, doe not set God any bounds, but they who command them; for
							they who worship unwillingly, doe worship in very deed, but they either stand or fall there, where they are commanded to stand or fall by a lawfull Soveraign.
							Secondly, I say it must be done, not at all times, and every where, but on supposition that there is no other rule of worshipping God beside the dictates of humane
							reason; for then the will of the City stands for Reason. But in the Kingdome of God by way of Covenant, whether old, or new, where idolatry is expressely forbid,
							though the City commands us to worship thus, yet must we not do it. Which, if he shall consider, who conceived some repugnancy between this, and the 14. Article, will
							surely cease to think so any longer</hi>. </p>
					<p> XIX. From what hath been said may be gathered, that God reigning by the way of <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0315" n="260"/>naturall reason onely, Subjects doe sinne, First, if they break the morall Laws, which
						are unfolded in the second and third Chapters. Secondly, if they break the Lawes, or commands of the City in those things which pertain to Justice. Thirdly, if they
						worship not God, <foreign lang="gre">
							<hi rend="italic">&kgr;&agr;&tgr;&#x1F70; &tgr;&#x1F70;
								&ngr;&#x1F79;&mgr;&igr;&kgr;&agr; </hi>
						</foreign>. Fourthly, if they confesse not before men, both in words, and deeds, that there is one God most good, most great, most blessed, the Supreme King of the
						World, and of all worldly Kings; that is to say, if they doe not worship God. This fourth sinne in the naturall Kingdome of God, by what hath been said in the foregoing
						Chapter, in the second Article, is the <hi rend="italic">sinne of Treason against the Divine Majesty</hi>; for it is a denying of the Divine Power, or <hi rend="italic"
							>Atheisme</hi>. For sinnes proceed here, just as if we should suppose some man to be the Soveraign King, who being himselfe absent, should rule by his Vice-Roy;
						against whom sure they would transgresse who should not obey his Vice-Roy in all things, except he usurpt the Kingdome to himself, or would give it to some other; but
						they who should so absolutely obey him, as not to admit of this exception, might be said to be guilty of Treason.<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0316" n="261"/></p>

					<p>I.  Supersition possessing Forrain Nations, God institued the true Religion by the means of Abraham.</p>
					<p>II.  By the Covenant between God and Adam, all dispute is forbidden concerning the Commands of Suriours.</p>
					<p>III.  The manner of the Covenant between God and Abraham.</p>
					<p>IV.  In that Covenant is contained an acknowledgement of God, no simply, but of him who appeared unto Abraham.</p>
					<p>V.  The Lawes unto which Abraham was tyed, were no other beside those of Nature, and the Law of Circumcision.</p>
					<p>VI.  Abraham was the Interpreter of the Word of God, and of all Lawes amon those that belonged to him.</p>
					<p>VII.  Abrahams subjects could not sinne by obeying him.</p>
					<p>VIII.  Gods Covenant with the Hebrews at Mount Sinai.</p>
					<p>IX.  From thence, Gods Government took the name of a Kingdome.<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0317" n="262"/></p>
					<p>X.  What Lawes were by God given to the Jewes.</p>
					<p>XI.  What the Word of God is, and how to be known.</p>
					<p>XII.  What was held the written Word of God among the Jewes.</p>
					<p>XIII.  The power of interpreting the Word of God, and the supreme civill power were unitedin Moises whe he lived.</p>
					<p>XIV.  They were also united in the High Priest, during the life of Joshuah.</p>
					<p>XV.  They were united too in the High Priest untill King Sauls time.</p>
					<p>XVI.  They were also united in the Kings untill the captivity.</p>
					<p>XVII.  They were so in the High Priests after the captivity.</p>
					<p>XVIII.  Deniall of the Divine Providence, and Idolatry, were the onely Treasons against the Divine Majesty among the Jewes, in all things else they ought to obey their
					Princes.</p>
					<lb/>
					<p> I. Mankind, from conscience of its own weaknesse, and admiration of naturall events, hath this, that most men beleeve God to be the invisible Maker of all visible
						things, whom they also fear, conceiving that they have not a sufficient protection in themselves; but the imperfect use they had of their Reason, the violence of <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0318" n="263"/>their
						Passions did so clowd them, that they could not rightly worship him. Now the fear of invisible things, when it is sever'd from right reason is superstition. It was
						therefore almost impossible for men without the speciall assistance of God to avoyd both Rocks of <hi rend="italic">Atheisme </hi>and <hi rend="italic"
						>Superstition</hi>: for this proceeds from fear without right reason, that, from an <hi rend="italic">opinion of right reason</hi>, without feare. </p>
					<p>
						<hi rend="italic">Idolatry </hi>therefore did easily fasten upon the greatest part of men, and almost all nations did worship God in <hi rend="italic">Images</hi>, and
							<hi rend="italic">resemblances </hi>of finite things; and they worshipt spirits, or vain visions, perhaps out of fear calling them Devills. But it pleased the Divine
						Majesty (as we read it written in the sacred history) out of all mankind to call forth <hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>, by whose means he might bring men to the true
						worship of him, and to reveal himselfe supernaturally to him, and to make that most famous Covenant with him and his seed, which is called the <hi rend="italic">old
							Covenant</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Testament</hi>. He therefore is the head of true Religion; he was the first that <hi rend="italic">after the Deluge taught, that
							there was one God, the Creatour of the Universe</hi>; And from him the <hi rend="italic">Kingdome of God by way of Covenants</hi>, takes its beginning. <hi
							rend="italic">Joseph</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Antiq. Jewes. lib.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">cap</hi>. 7. </p>
					<p> II. In the beginning of the world God reigned indeed, not onely naturally, but also <hi rend="italic">by way of Covenant</hi>, over <hi rend="italic">Adam</hi>, and
							<hi rend="italic">Eve</hi>; so as it seems he would have no obedience yeelded to him, beside that which naturall Reason should dictate, but <hi rend="italic">by the
								way of Covenant</hi>, that is to say, by the consent of men <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0319" n="264"/>themselves. Now because this <hi rend="italic">Covenant </hi>was presently made void, nor ever after
						renewed, the originall of Gods <hi rend="italic">Kingdom </hi>(which we treat of in this place) is not to be taken thence. Yet this is to be noted by the way, that by
						that precept of not eating of the tree of <hi rend="italic">the knowledge of good and evill</hi> (whether the judicature of good and evill, or the eating of the fruit
						of some tree were forbidden) God did require a most simple obedience to his commands, without dispute whether that were good, or evill, which was commanded; for the
						fruit of the tree, if the Command be wanting, hath nothing in its own nature, whereby the eating of it could be morally evill, that is to say, a sinne. </p>
					<p> III. Now the Covenant between <hi rend="italic">God </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>, was made in this manner. <hi rend="italic">Gen</hi>. 17. v. 7, 8. <hi
							rend="italic">I will establish my Covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee in their generations,for an everlasting Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and
							to thy seed after thee. And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the Land wherein thou art a stranger, all the Land of Canaan, for an everlasting
							possession, and I will be their God.</hi> Now it was necessary to institute some sign whereby <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>and his seed should retain the memory of
						this Covenant; wherefore <hi rend="italic">Circumcision </hi>was added to the Covenant, but yet as a sign onely. vers 10: <hi rend="italic">This is my Covenant which
							yee shall keep between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, every man-child among you shall be circumcised, and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and
							it shall be a token of the Covenant between me and you</hi>. It is therefore Covenanted, that <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>shall acknowledge <pb
								entity="DSSR_000002537_0320" n="265"/><hi rend="italic">God
						</hi>to be his God, and the God of his seed; that is to say, that he shall submit himselfe to be governed by him, and that God shall give unto <hi rend="italic">Abraham
						</hi>the inheritance of that Land wherein he then dwelt, but as a Pilgrim, and that <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>for a memoriall sign of this Covenant, should take
						care to see himselfe, and his male seed <hi rend="italic">circumcised</hi>. </p>
					<p> IV. But seeing that <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>even before the Covenant acknowledged God to be the Creatour and King of the world, (for he never doubted either of
						the <hi rend="italic">being</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">Providence </hi>of God) how comes it not to be superfluous, that God would purchase to himself with a price,
						and by <hi rend="italic">contract</hi>, an obedience which was due to him by nature; namely by promising <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>the Land of <hi rend="italic"
							>Canaan</hi>, upon condition that he would receive him for his God, when by the Right of nature he was already so? By those words therefore, To be a <hi rend="italic"
							>God unto thee and to thy seed after thee,</hi> wee understand not that <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>satisfied this <hi rend="italic">Covenant </hi>by a bare
						acknowledgement of the power, and Dominion which God had naturally over men, that is to say, by acknowledging God indefinitely, which belongs to <hi rend="italic"
							>naturall reason</hi>; but he must definitely acknowledge him, who said unto him, <hi rend="italic">Gen.</hi> 12. v. 1. <hi rend="italic">Get thee out of thy
						Country,</hi> &amp;amp;c. <hi rend="italic">Gen</hi>. 13. v. 14. <hi rend="italic">Lift up thine eyes.</hi> &amp;amp;c. who appear'd unto him, <hi rend="italic"
							>Gen</hi>. 18. v. 1. in the shape of three celestiall men, and <hi rend="italic">Gen</hi>. 15. v. 1. In a <hi rend="italic">vision</hi>; and <hi rend="italic"
						>vers</hi>. 13. In a <hi rend="italic">dream</hi>, which <hi rend="italic">is matter of faith</hi>. In what shape God appeared unto <hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>, by
						what kinde of sound he spake to him, is not <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0321" n="266"/>exprest, yet it is plain that <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>beleeved that voyce to be the voyce of God, and a true
						Revelation; and would have all his to worship him, who had so spoken unto him, for God the Creatour of the world; and that his faith was grounded on this, not that he
						beleeved God <hi rend="italic">to have a being</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">that he was true</hi> in his promises, that which all men beleeve, but that he doubted not him
						to be God, whose voice, and promises he had heard; and that the <hi rend="italic">God </hi>of <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>signified not simply <hi rend="italic"
						>God</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">that God which appeared unto him</hi>, even as the worship which <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>owed unto God in that notion, was not
						the worship of <hi rend="italic">reason</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">of Religion</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Faith</hi>, and that, which not reason, but God had <hi
							rend="italic">supernaturally </hi>revealed. </p>
					<p> V. But we read of no Lawes given by God to <hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>, or by <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>to his family, either then, or after, secular, or
						sacred (excepting the Commandement of <hi rend="italic">Circumcision</hi>, which is contained in the <hi rend="italic">Covenant </hi>it selfe); whence it is manifest,
						that there were no other Lawes, or worship, which <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>was obliged to, but the Lawes of nature, rationall worship, and circumcision. </p>
					<p> VI. Now <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>was the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter </hi>of all <hi rend="italic">Lawes</hi>, as well sacred as secular, among those that
						belonged to him, not meerly naturally, as using the Lawes of nature onely, but even by the form of the Covenant it selfe, in which obedience is promised by <hi
							rend="italic">Abraham </hi>not for himselfe onely, but for his seed also; <hi rend="italic">which </hi>had been in vain, except his children had been tyed to obey his
						Commands: And how can that be understood, which God sayes <hi rend="italic">Gen</hi>. 18. vers. 18. 19. (<hi rend="italic">All <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0322" n="267"/>the Nations of the earth shall be blessed
							in him; for I know him, that he will command his children, and his houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord to doe justice, and judgement</hi>)
						unlesse his children and his houshold were supposed to be obliged to yeeld obedience unto his Commands. </p>
					<p> VII. Hence it followes, that <hi rend="italic">Abrahams </hi>subjects could not sinne in obeying him, provided that <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>commanded them not,
						to deny Gods <hi rend="italic">Existence</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Providence</hi>, or to doe somewhat expresly contrary to the honour of God. In all other things, <hi
							rend="italic">the word of God</hi> was to be fetcht from his lips only, as being the Interpreter of all the <hi rend="italic">Lawes</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">words
						</hi>of God. For <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>alone could teach them who was the God of <hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>, and in what manner he was to be worshipped.
						And they who after <hi rend="italic">Abrahams </hi>death were subject to the Soveraignty of <hi rend="italic">Isaac </hi>or <hi rend="italic">Iacob</hi>, did by the
						same reason obey them in all things without sin, as long as they acknowledged, and profest <hi rend="italic">the God</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>to be their
						God. For they had submitted themselves <hi rend="italic">to God</hi> simply, before they did it to <hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>; and to <hi rend="italic">Abraham
						</hi>before they did it to the God of <hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>; againe, to the God of <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>before they did it to <hi rend="italic"
						>Isaac</hi>: In <hi rend="italic">Abrahams </hi>subjects therefore, To deny God was <hi rend="italic">the only Treason against the Divine Majesty</hi>; but in their
						posterity it was also Treason <hi rend="italic">to deny the God </hi>of <hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>, that is to say, to worship God otherwise then was instituted by
						<hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>, to wit, in Images (*) made with hands, as other Nations did, which for that reason were called <hi rend="italic">Idolators</hi>.<pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0323" n="268"/>" And
						hitherto subjects might easily enough discern what was to be observed, what avoyded in the Commands of their Princes. [In Images made with hands]<hi rend="italic"> In
							the</hi> 15. <hi rend="italic">Chap</hi>. 14.<hi rend="italic"> Article, There wee have shewed such a kinde of worship to be irrationall; but if it be done by the
							command of a City to whom the written word of God is not known, nor received, we have then shewed this worship in the</hi> 15. <hi rend="italic">Chap. art.</hi> 18.
							<hi rend="italic">to be rationall. But where God reigns by way of Covenant, in which it is expresly warned not to worship thus, as in the Covenant made with
						</hi>Abraham, <hi rend="italic">there, whether it be with, or without the Command of the City, it is ill done.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> VIII. To goe on now, following the guidance of the holy Scripture, The same <hi rend="italic">Covenant </hi>was renewed, <hi rend="italic">Gen</hi>. 26. vers. 3, 4.
						with <hi rend="italic">Isaac</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Gen</hi>. 28. vers. 14. with <hi rend="italic">Iacob</hi>, where <hi rend="italic">God </hi>stiles himselfe not
						simply <hi rend="italic">God</hi>, whom nature doth dictate him to be, but distinctly the <hi rend="italic">God of Abraham</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Isaac</hi>;
						afterward being about to renew the same <hi rend="italic">Covenant</hi>, by <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>, with the whole People of Israel, <hi rend="italic">Exod</hi>.
						3. v. 6. <hi rend="italic">I am</hi> saith he <hi rend="italic">the God of thy Father, the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi rend="italic">the God of</hi> Isaac,<hi
							rend="italic"> and the God of</hi> Jacob. Afterward when that People, not only the freest, but also the greatest enemy to humane subjection, by reason of the fresh
						memory of their AEgyptian bondage, abode in the wildernesse near mount <hi rend="italic">Sinai</hi>, that <hi rend="italic">antient Covenant</hi> was propounded to them
						all to be renewed in this manner, <hi rend="italic">Exod</hi>. 19. ver. 5. <hi rend="italic">Therefore if yee will obey my voice indeed, and keep my Covenant,</hi> (to
						wit, that Covenant which was made with <hi rend="italic">Abraham, Isaac</hi>,<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0324" n="269"/>" and <hi rend="italic">Iacob</hi>) <hi rend="italic">then shall yee be a peculiar Treasure
							unto me, above all People; for all the earth is mine, and yee shall be to me a Kingdome of Priests, and an holy Nation. And all the People answered together, and
							said, All that the Lord hath spoken, will we doe,</hi> vers. 8. </p>
					<p> IX. In this Covenant, among other things, we must consider well the appellation of <hi rend="italic">Kingdom </hi>not used before. For although God both by <hi
							rend="italic">nature </hi>&amp; by <hi rend="italic">Covenant </hi>made with <hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>, was their King, yet owed they him an obedience and
						worship only naturall, as being his subjects; &amp; religious such as <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>instituted, as being the Subjects of <hi rend="italic">Abraham,
							Isaac, &amp; Iacob</hi>, their naturall <hi rend="italic">Princes</hi>; For they had received no <hi rend="italic">word of God</hi> beside the naturall word of
						right reason, neither had any <hi rend="italic">Covenant </hi>past between God and them, otherwise then as their wils were included in the will of <hi rend="italic"
							>Abraham</hi>, as their <hi rend="italic">Prince</hi>. But now by the Covenant made at mount <hi rend="italic">Sinai</hi>, the consent of each man being had, there
						becomes an <hi rend="italic">institutive Kingdome of God</hi> over them. That <hi rend="italic">Kingdom of God</hi> so renowned in Scriptures and writings of Divines,
						took its beginning from this time, and hither tends that which God said to <hi rend="italic">Samuel</hi>, when the Israelites asked a King, 1. <hi rend="italic"
						>Sam</hi>. 8. 7.<hi rend="italic"> They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them</hi>; and that which <hi rend="italic"
							>Samuel </hi>told the Israelites, 1. Sam. 12. 12. <hi rend="italic">Yee said unto me, nay, but a King shall reign over us, when the Lord your God was your King</hi>;
						and that which is said, Jer. 31. vers. 31. <hi rend="italic">I will make a new Covenant,</hi> &amp;amp;c. <hi rend="italic">Although I was an Husband unto
							them</hi>; And the doctrine also of <hi rend="italic">Judas Galilaeus</hi>,<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0325" n="270"/>" where mention is made in <hi rend="italic">Ioseph. Antiq. of the Iewes</hi>, 18. <hi
							rend="italic">Book</hi>, 2. <hi rend="italic">Chap</hi>. in these words: <hi rend="italic">But </hi>Judas Galilaeus<hi rend="italic"> was the first authour of this
							fourth way of those who followed the study of wisdome. These agree in all the rest with the </hi>Pharisees, <hi rend="italic">excepting that they burn with a most
							constant desire of liberty, beleeving God alone to be held for their Lord and Prince, and will sooner endure even the most exquisite kinds of torments, together with
							their kinsfolks, and dearest friends, then call any mortall man their Lord</hi>. </p>
					<p> X. The Right of the Kingdome being thus constituted by way of <hi rend="italic">Covenant</hi>, let us see in the next place, what <hi rend="italic">lawes </hi>God
						propounded to them; now those are knowne to all, to wit, the <hi rend="italic">Decalogue</hi>, and those other, as well <hi rend="italic">judiciall as ceremoniall
						lawes</hi>, which we find from the 20. <hi rend="italic">Chap</hi>. of <hi rend="italic">Exodus </hi>to the end of <hi rend="italic">Deuteronomie</hi>, and the death of
							<hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>. Now of those <hi rend="italic">lawes </hi>deliver'd in generall by the hand of <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>, some there are which
						oblige <hi rend="italic">naturally</hi>, being made by <hi rend="italic">God</hi>, as the <hi rend="italic">God of nature,</hi> and had their force even before <hi
							rend="italic">Abrahams </hi>time; others there are which oblige by vertue of the <hi rend="italic">Covenant </hi>made with <hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>, being made
						by <hi rend="italic">God </hi>as the <hi rend="italic">God </hi>of <hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>, which had their force even before <hi rend="italic">Moyses </hi>his
						time, by reason of the former <hi rend="italic">Covenant</hi>; but there are <hi rend="italic">others </hi>which oblige by vertue of that Covenant onely which was made
						last with the people themselves, being made by <hi rend="italic">God</hi>, as being <hi rend="italic">the Peculiar</hi> King of the <hi rend="italic">Israelites</hi>.
						Of the first sort are all the Precepts of the <hi rend="italic">Decalogue </hi>which pertaine unto manners, such as, <hi rend="italic">Honour thy Parents, thou shalt
							not Kill, thou shalt not commit Adultery, thou shalt not <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0326" n="271"/>Steale, thou shalt not beare false witnesse, thou shalt not Covet</hi>; For they are the Lawes of nature;
						Also the precept of not taking <hi rend="italic">Gods name in vaine</hi>, for it is a part of naturall worship, as hath beene declar'd in the foregoing Chap. Art. 15.
						In like manner the second Commandement of not worshipping by way of any Image made by themselves; for this also is a part of naturall Religion, as hath beene shewed in
						the same Article. Of the second sort is the first Commandment of the Decalogue, <hi rend="italic">of not having any other Gods</hi>; for in that consists the essence of
						the <hi rend="italic">Covenant </hi>made with <hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>, by which God requires nothing else, but that he should be his God, and the God of his
						seede: Also the Precept of keeping <hi rend="italic">holy the Sabbath</hi>; for the Sanctification of the seventh day is instituted in memoriall of the six dayes
						Creation, as appeares out of these words, <hi rend="italic">Exod</hi>. 31. ver. 16, 17. It is a perpetuall Covenant, (meaning the Sabbath) and a signe betweene me, and
						the Children of Israel for ever, for in sixe dayes the Lord made Heaven, and Earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. Of the third kind are the
						Politique, judiciall and Ceremoniall lawes, which onely belong'd to the Jewes. The lawes of the first and second sort written in Tables of stone, to wit the Decalogue,
						was kept in the Ark it selfe. The rest written in the volume of the whole Law, were laid up in the side of the Arke. Deut. 31. ver. 26. For these retaining the faith of
						Abraham might be chang'd, those could not. </p>
					<p> XI. All Gods <hi rend="italic">Lawes </hi>are <hi rend="italic">Gods Word</hi>; <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0327" n="272"/>but all <hi rend="italic">Gods Word</hi> is not his <hi rend="italic">Law. I am the
							Lord thy God which brought thee out of the Land of AEgypt</hi>, is the word of God, it is no Law: Neither is all that which for the better declaring of <hi
							rend="italic">Gods Word</hi> is pronounc't, or written together with it, instantly to be taken for <hi rend="italic">Gods Word</hi>: For, <hi rend="italic">Thus saith
							the Lord</hi>, is not the voice of God, but of the Preacher or Prophet. All that, and onely that, is the word of God which a true Prophet hath declar'd God to have
						spoken. Now the writings of the Prophets comprehending as well those things which God, as which the Prophet himselfe speaks, are therefore called the word of God,
						because they containe the word of God. Now because all that, and that alone, is the <hi rend="italic">Word of God</hi> which is recommended to us for such, by a true
						Prophet, it cannot be knowne what <hi rend="italic">Gods Word</hi> is, before we know who is the true Prophet; nor can we beleeve <hi rend="italic">Gods Word</hi>,
						before we beleeve the Prophet. <hi rend="italic">Moyses </hi>was beleev'd by the People of <hi rend="italic">Israel </hi>for two things, His <hi rend="italic"
						>Miracles</hi>, and his <hi rend="italic">Faith</hi>; for how great, and most evident Miracles soever he had wrought, yet would they not have trusted him, at least he
						was not to have beene trusted, if he had call'd them out of <hi rend="italic">AEgypt </hi>to any other worship then the worship of the God of <hi rend="italic">Abraham,
							Isaac</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Jacob </hi>their Fathers. For it had beene contrary to the <hi rend="italic">Covenant </hi>made by themselves with God. In like
						manner two things there are, to wit, <hi rend="italic">supernaturall Prediction of things to come</hi>, which is a mighty miracle; and <hi rend="italic">Faith in the
							God of</hi> Abraham <hi rend="italic">their deliverer out of AEgypt</hi>, which God <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0328" n="273"/>propos'd to all the <hi rend="italic">Jews </hi>to be kept for marks of a true
						Prophet. He that wants either of these is no Prophet, nor is it to be receiv'd for Gods word which he obtrudes for such. If Faith be wanting, he is rejected in these
						words, <hi rend="italic">Deut</hi>. 13. <hi rend="italic">ver</hi>. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.<hi rend="italic"> If there arise among you a Prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and
							giveth thee a signe, or a wonder, and the signe or the wonder come to Passe, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us goe after other Gods, &amp; c.</hi> That
							Prophet, or that dreamer of dreames shall be put to death. If Praediction of events be wanting, he is condemn'd by these, <hi rend="italic">Deut</hi>. 18. <hi
							rend="italic">ver</hi>. 21, 22. <hi rend="italic">And if thou say in thine heart, how shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken? When a Prophet speaketh
							in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to Passe, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the Prophet hath spoken it
						presumptuously.</hi> Now, that that is the word of God which is publisht for such by a true Prophet, and that he was held to be a true Prophet among the <hi
							rend="italic">Jewes</hi>, whose faith was true, and to whose praedictions the events answer'd, is without controversie. But what it is to follow other Gods, and
						whether the events which are affirm'd to answer their praedictions, doe truly answer them, or not, may admit many controversies, specially in praedictions which
						obscurely, &amp; aenigmatically foretell the Event, such as the praedictions of almost all the Prophets are, as who saw not God apparently like unto <hi
							rend="italic">Moyses</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">in darke speeches, and in figures.</hi>
						<hi rend="italic">Numb</hi>. 12. <hi rend="italic">ver</hi>. 8. But of these we cannot judge otherwise then <hi rend="italic">by the way of <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0329"
							n="274"/>naturall reason</hi>;
						because that Judgment depends on the Prophets interpretation, and on its proportion with the Event. </p>
					<p> XII. The <hi rend="italic">Jewes </hi>did hold the booke of the whole Law which was called <hi rend="italic">Deuteronomie</hi>, for <hi rend="italic">the written word
							of God</hi>, and that onely, (forasmuch as can be collected out of sacred history) untill the Captivity; for this booke was deliver'd by <hi rend="italic">Moyses
						</hi>himselfe to the Priests to be kept, and layd up in the side of the Ark of the Covenant, and to be copyed out by the Kings; and the same a long time after by the
						authority of King <hi rend="italic">Josiah </hi>acknowledg'd againe for <hi rend="italic">the Word of God.</hi>
						<hi rend="italic">Kings </hi>23. <hi rend="italic">ver</hi>. 2. But it is not manifest when the rest of the books of the Old Testament were first receiv'd into Canon.
						But what concernes the Prophets, <hi rend="italic">Isaiah </hi>and the rest, since they foretold no other things then what were to come to passe, either in or after the
						Captivity, their writings could not at that time be held for Prophetique, by reason of the Law cited above. Deut. 18. ver. 21, 22. Whereby the <hi rend="italic"
							>Israelites</hi> were commanded not to account any man for a true Prophet but him whose Prophecies were answer'd by the events; And hence peradventure it is that the
							<hi rend="italic">Jews </hi>esteem'd the writings of those whom they slew when they Prophesied, for Prophetique afterward, that is to say, for the word of God. </p>
					<p> XIII. It being known what Lawes there were under <hi rend="italic">the old Covenant</hi>, and that <hi rend="italic">Word of God</hi> receiv'd from the beginning; we
						must farthermore consider with whom the authority of judging, whether the writings of the Prophets arising afterward, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0330" n="275"/>were to be receiv'd for the Word of God, that is
						to say, whether the Events did answer their praedictions or not, and with whom also the authority <hi rend="italic">of interpreting the Lawes already receiv'd, and the
							written Word of God</hi>, did reside; which thing is to be trac't through all the times, and severall changes of the Commonwealth of Israel. But it is manifest that
						this power during the life of <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>, was intirely in himselfe; for if he had not been the <hi rend="italic">Interpreter of the Lawes and
						Word</hi>, that office must have belong'd either to <hi rend="italic">every private person</hi>, or to a <hi rend="italic">congregation</hi>, or <hi rend="italic"
							>Synagogue </hi>of many, or to the <hi rend="italic">High-Priest</hi>, or to other <hi rend="italic">Prophets</hi>. First, that that office belong'd not to private
						men, or any Congregation made of them, appeares hence, that they were not admitted, nay they were prohibited, with most heavy threats, <hi rend="italic">to heare
						God</hi> speake, otherwise then by the means of <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>; for it is written, <hi rend="italic">Let not the Priests and the people break through to
							come up unto the Lord, lest he break forth upon them. So Moyses went downe unto the people, and spake unto them.</hi> Exod. 19. 24, 25. It is farther manifestly, and
						expresly declar'd, upon occasion given by the Rebellion of <hi rend="italic">Core, Dathan</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Abiram</hi>, and the two hundred and fifty Princes
						of the Assembly, that neither private men, nor the Congregation should pretend that God had spoken by them, and by Consequence that they had <hi rend="italic">the right
							of interpreting Gods Word</hi>; for they contending, that God spake no lesse by them then by <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>, argue thus, <hi rend="italic">Yee take too
								much upon you, seeing all the Congregation are holy, every one of them, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0331" n="276"/>and the Lord is among them; wherefore then lift yee up your selves above the Congregation of
							the Lord?</hi> Numb. 16. <hi rend="italic">ver</hi>. 3. But how God determin'd this controversie is easily understood by the 33. and 35. verses of the same Chapter,
						where <hi rend="italic">Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Abiram went downe alive into the Pit, and there came out fire from the Lord, and consumed the two
							hundred and fifty men that offer'd Incense</hi>: Secondly, that <hi rend="italic">Aaron </hi>the high Priest had not this authority, is manifest by the like
						controversie betweene him (together with his Sister <hi rend="italic">Miriam</hi>) and <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>; For the question was, whether God spake by <hi
							rend="italic">Moyses </hi>only, or by them also, that is to say, whether <hi rend="italic">Moyses </hi>alone, or whether they also were <hi rend="italic">interpreters
							of the Word of God</hi>. For thus they said, <hi rend="italic">Hath the Lord indeed spoken onely by</hi> Moyses? <hi rend="italic">Hath he not also spoken by us</hi>?
						Numb. 12. <hi rend="italic">ver</hi>. 2. But God reprov'd them, and made a distinction betweene <hi rend="italic">Moyses </hi>and other <hi rend="italic">Prophets</hi>,
						saying, <hi rend="italic">If there be a Prophet among you, I the Lord will make my selfe knowne unto him in a vision, and will speake unto him in a dreame: My
						Servant</hi> Moyses <hi rend="italic">is not so, &amp;amp;c. For with him will I speake mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in darke speeches, and the
							Similitude of the Lord shall he behold; wherefore then were yee not afraid to speake against my Servant Moyses</hi>? Ibid. ver. 6, 7, 8. Lastly, that <hi
							rend="italic">the interpretation of the Word of God</hi> as long as <hi rend="italic">Moses</hi> liv'd, belong'd not to any other Prophets whatsoever, is collected
						out of that place which we now cited concerning his eminency above all others, and out of naturall reason, for as much as it <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0332" n="277"/>belongs to the same Prophet who brings the
						Commands of God to unfold them too; but there was then no other <hi rend="italic">Word of God</hi>, beside that which was declar'd by <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>. And
						out of this also, that there was no other Prophet extant at that time, who Prophesied to the people, excepting the 70. Elders who Prophesied by <hi rend="italic">the
							Spirit</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>; and even that <hi rend="italic">Joshuah</hi>, who was then <hi rend="italic">Moyses </hi>his Servant, his successour
						afterward, beleev'd to be injuriously done, till he knew it was by <hi rend="italic">Moyses </hi>his Consent; which thing is manifest by Text of Scripture, <hi
							rend="italic">And the Lord came downe in a clowd, &amp; c. and tooke of the spirit that was upon</hi> Moyses, <hi rend="italic">and gave it unto the </hi>70. <hi
							rend="italic">Elders</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Numb</hi>. 11. <hi rend="italic">ver</hi>. 25. Now after it was told that they Prophesied, <hi rend="italic">Joshuah
						</hi>said unto <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Forbid them my Lord.</hi> But <hi rend="italic">Moyses </hi>answered, <hi rend="italic">Why enviest thou
							for my sake</hi>? Seeing therefore <hi rend="italic">Moyses </hi>alone was <hi rend="italic">the Messenger of Gods Word,</hi> and that the <hi rend="italic">authority
							of interpreting</hi> it pertain'd neither to <hi rend="italic">private men</hi>, nor to <hi rend="italic">the Synagogue</hi>, nor to the <hi rend="italic">High
						Priest</hi>, nor to other <hi rend="italic">Prophets</hi>; it remaines, that <hi rend="italic">Moyses </hi>alone was <hi rend="italic">the Interpreter of Gods
						Word,</hi> who also had the supreme power in civill matters; And that the conventions of Corah with the rest of his complices against <hi rend="italic">Moses </hi>and
							<hi rend="italic">Aaron</hi>; and of <hi rend="italic">Aaron </hi>with his Sister against <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>, were rais'd, not for the salvation of their
						soules, but by reason of their ambition, and desire of Dominion over the People. </p>
					<p> XIV. In <hi rend="italic">Joshuahs </hi>time <hi rend="italic">the interpretation of the Lawes,</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">the Word of God</hi>, belong'd to <hi
						rend="italic">Eleazar </hi>the High Priest, who was also under God, their absolute King; which <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0333" n="278"/>is collected first of all out of the <hi rend="italic">Covenant it
							selfe</hi>, in which the Common-wealth of <hi rend="italic">Israel </hi>is called a <hi rend="italic">Priestly Kingdome,</hi> or as it is recited in the 1 <hi
							rend="italic">Pet</hi>. 2. 9. A <hi rend="italic">Royall Priesthood</hi>; which could in no wise be sayd, unlesse by the institution and <hi rend="italic">Covenant
						</hi>of the People, the regall power were understood to belong to the <hi rend="italic">High Priest</hi>. Neither doth this repugne what hath beene said before, where
							<hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>, and not <hi rend="italic">Aaron</hi>, had the Kingdome under God; since it is necessary that when one man institutes the forme of a
						future Common-wealth, that one should governe the Kingdome which he institutes, during his life, (whether it be <hi rend="italic">Monarchie, Aristocraty,</hi> or <hi
							rend="italic">Democraty</hi>) and have all that power for the present, which he is bestowing on others for the future. Now, that <hi rend="italic">Eleazar </hi>the
						Priest, had not onely <hi rend="italic">the Priesthood</hi>, but also <hi rend="italic">the Soveraignty,</hi> is expressely set downe in <hi rend="italic">Joshuahs
						</hi>call to the administration; for thus it is written. <hi rend="italic">Take thee </hi>Joshuah <hi rend="italic">the Son of</hi> Nun, <hi rend="italic">a man in whom
							is the Spirit, and lay thine hand upon him, and set him before</hi> Eleazer <hi rend="italic">the Priest, and before all the Congregation, and give him a charge in
							their sight, and thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the Congregation of the Children of</hi> Israel<hi rend="italic"> may be obedient, and he
							shall stand before </hi>Eleazar <hi rend="italic">the Priest, who shall aske Counsell for him after the judgment of </hi>Urim, <hi rend="italic">before the Lord: at
							his word shall they goe out, and at his word shall they come in, and all the Children of</hi> Israel <hi rend="italic">with him, even all the Congregation.</hi> Num.
						27. ver. 18, 19, 20, 21. where <hi rend="italic">to aske Counsell of God for whatsoever is to be done,</hi> (that is)<hi rend="italic"> to interpret Gods word,</hi> and
						in the name of God <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0334" n="279"/>to Command in all matters, belongs to <hi rend="italic">Eleazar</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">to goe out</hi>, and,<hi rend="italic"> to come in at his
							word,</hi> that is to say, to obey, belongs both to <hi rend="italic">Joshuah</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">to all the People.</hi> Its to be observ'd also, that that
						speech, <hi rend="italic">Part of thy glory</hi>; clearely denotes that <hi rend="italic">Joshuah </hi>had not a power equall with that which <hi rend="italic">Moyses
						</hi>had. In the meane time it is manifest, that even in <hi rend="italic">Ioshuahs </hi>time, the Supreme power and authority of interpreting the word of God, were
						both in one Person. </p>
					<p> XV. After <hi rend="italic">Ioshuahs </hi>death follow the times of the <hi rend="italic">Iudges</hi> untill King <hi rend="italic">Saul</hi>, in which it is manifest
						that the right of the <hi rend="italic">Kingdome </hi>instituted by God, remained with the High Priest. For the Kingdome was by Covenant <hi rend="italic"
						>Priestly</hi>, that is to say, Gods government by Priests; and such ought it to have been untill that form with Gods consent were changed by the people themselves:
						which was not done, before that requiring a King God consented unto them, and said unto <hi rend="italic">Samuel, Hearken unto the voyce of the people in all that they
							say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me that I should not reign over them.</hi> 1. Sam. 8. 7. The supreme civill power was therefore
							<hi rend="italic">Rightly </hi>due by Gods own institution to the High-Priest; but actually that power was in the Prophets, to whom (being raysed by God in an
						extraordinary manner) the <hi rend="italic">Israelites </hi>(a people greedy of the Prophets) submitted themselves to be protected, and judged, by reason of the great
						esteem they had of Prophecies. The Reason of this thing, was, because that though penalties were set, and Judges appointed in the institution of <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0335" n="280"/>Gods priestly Kingdome,
						yet, the Right of inflicting punishment, depended wholly on private judgement; and it belonged to a dissolute multitude, and each single Person, to punish or not to
						punish according as their private zeale should stirre them up. And therefore <hi rend="italic">Moyses </hi>by his own command punisht no man with death; but when any
						man was to be put to death, one or many stirred up the multitude against him or them, by divine authority, and saying,<hi rend="italic"> Thus saith the Lord.</hi> Now
						this was conformable to the nature of Gods peculiar Kingdome. For there God reignes indeed where his Lawes are obeyed, not for fear of men, but for fear of himselfe.
						And truly, if men were such as they should be, this were an excellent state of civill government; but as men are, there is a coercive power (in which I comprehend both
						right and might) necessary to rule them. And therefore also God from the beginning prescribed Lawes by <hi rend="italic">Moyses </hi>for the future Kings. <hi
							rend="italic">Deut</hi>. 17. <hi rend="italic">vers</hi>. 14. and <hi rend="italic">Moyses </hi>foretold this in bis last words to the people, saying, <hi
							rend="italic">I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt your selves, and turn aside from the way that I have commanded you,</hi> &amp;amp;c. Deut. 31.
						29. When therefore according to this prediction there arose another generation <hi rend="italic">who knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel,
							the children of Israel did evill in the sight of the Lord, and served </hi>Balaam, <hi rend="italic">Iud</hi>. 2. 10, 11. to wit, they cast off Gods government, that
						is to say, that of the <hi rend="italic">Priest</hi>, by whom God ruled, and afterward, when they were overcome by their enemies, and opprest with bondage, they looked
						for <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0336" n="281"/>Gods will, not at the hands of the <hi rend="italic">Priest </hi>any more, but of the Prophets. These therefore <hi rend="italic">actually </hi>judged <hi
							rend="italic">Israel</hi>, but their obedience was <hi rend="italic">rightly due</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">High Priest</hi>; Although therefore the Priestly
						Kingdome after the death of <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">Ioshuah</hi>, was without power, yet was it not without Right. Now that the <hi
							rend="italic">interpretation of Gods word</hi> did belong to the same High Priest, is manifest by this, That God, after the Tabernacle, &amp; the Ark of the
						Covenant was consecrated, spake no more in mount <hi rend="italic">Sinai</hi>, but in the Tabernacle of the Covenant, from the propitiatory which was between the <hi
							rend="italic">Cherubims</hi>, whether it was not lawfull for any to aproach except the High Priest. If therefore regard be had to the <hi rend="italic">Right </hi>of
						the Kingdome, <hi rend="italic">the supreme civill Power, and the authority of interpreting Gods word,</hi> were joyned in the High Priest; If we consider the <hi
							rend="italic">fact</hi>, they were united in the Prophets who judged <hi rend="italic">Israel</hi>. For as <hi rend="italic">Iudges</hi>, they bad the civill
						authority, as <hi rend="italic">Prophets</hi>, they interpreted Gods word, and thus every way hitherto these two powers continued inseparable. </p>
					<p> XVI. Kings being once constituted, its no doubt but the <hi rend="italic">civill authority</hi> belonged to them, for the Kingdome of God by the way of Priesthood,
						(God consenting to the request of the <hi rend="italic">Israelites</hi>) was ended; which <hi rend="italic">Hierom </hi>also marks speaking of the books of <hi
							rend="italic">Samuel</hi>: <hi rend="italic">Samuel </hi>(sayes he) <hi rend="italic">Eli being dead</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Saul</hi> slain, declares the old Law
						abolisht; Furthermore the Oaths of the new Priesthood, and new Soveraignty in <hi rend="italic">Zadok</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">David</hi>, do testifie, that the
						Right whereby the <hi rend="italic">Kings </hi>did rule, was founded in the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0337" n="282"/>very concession of the People. The Priest could rightfully do only what God had commanded,
						but the King had by right whatsoever power over every man that each man by right had over himself; for the <hi rend="italic">Israelites </hi>granted him <hi
							rend="italic">a Right</hi> to <hi rend="italic">judge </hi>of all things, and to <hi rend="italic">wage warre</hi> for all men; in which two are contained all Right
						whatsoever can be conceived from man to man. Our King (say they) <hi rend="italic">shall judge us, and goe out before us, and fight our battails,</hi> 1. <hi
							rend="italic">Sam</hi>. 8. 20. <hi rend="italic">Iudicature </hi>therefore belonged to the Kings; but to <hi rend="italic">judge </hi>is nothing else then <hi
							rend="italic">by interpreting to apply</hi> the <hi rend="italic">facts </hi>to the <hi rend="italic">Lawes</hi>; to them therefore belonged <hi rend="italic">the
							interpretation of Lawes too.</hi> And because there was no other written word of God acknowledged beside the <hi rend="italic">Law of Moyses</hi>, untill the
						Captivity, the authority <hi rend="italic">of interpreting Gods word</hi>, did also belong to the Kings; Nay, forasmuch as the word of God must be taken for a Law, if
						there had been another written word beside the Mosaicall Law, seeing the interpretation of Lawes belonged to the Kings, the interpretation of it must also have belonged
						to them. When the book of <hi rend="italic">Deuteronomie </hi>(in which the whole Mosaicall <hi rend="italic">Law </hi>was contained) being a long time lost, was found
						again, <hi rend="italic">the Priests</hi> indeed asked Counsell of God concerning that book; but not by their own authority, but by the Commandement of <hi
							rend="italic">Iosiah</hi>, and not immediately neither, but by the meanes of <hi rend="italic">Holda </hi>the Prophetesse. Whence it appears that the authority of
						admitting books for the word of God, belonged not to the Priest; neither yet followes it that that authority belonged to the Prophetesse, because others did judge of
						the Prophets <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0338" n="283"/>whether they were to be held for true, or not. For to what end did God give signes, and tokens to all the People, whereby the true Prophets might be
						discerned from the false, namely, the event of predictions, and conformity with the Religion establisht by <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>, if they might not use those
						marks? The authority therefore of admitting books for <hi rend="italic">the word of God</hi> belonged to the King, &amp; thus that book of the Law was approved, and
						received again by the authority of King <hi rend="italic">Iosiah</hi>, as appears by the fourth book of the <hi rend="italic">Kings</hi>, 22. 23. Chap. where it is
						reported that he gathered together all the severall degrees of his Kingdome, <hi rend="italic">the Elders, Priests, Prophets, and all the people, and he read in their
							eares all the words of the Covenant,</hi> that is to say, he caused that <hi rend="italic">Covenant </hi>to be acknowledged for the <hi rend="italic">Mosaicall
							Covenant</hi>, that is to say,<hi rend="italic"> for the word of God, </hi>and to be again received, and confirmed by the <hi rend="italic">Israelites</hi>. The
						civill power therefore, and the power of <hi rend="italic">discerning Gods word</hi> from the word of men, and of <hi rend="italic">interpreting Gods word</hi> even in
						the dayes of the Kings was wholly belonging to themselves. Prophets were sent not with authority, but in the form, and by the Right of Proclaimers, and Preachers, of
						whom the hearers did judge; and if perhaps these were punisht who did not listen to them plainly, teaching easie things, it doth not thence follow, that the Kings were
						obliged to follow all things which they in Gods name did declare, were to be followed. For though <hi rend="italic">Iosiah </hi>the good King of <hi rend="italic">Iudah
						</hi>were slain because he obeyed not the word of the Lord from the mouth of <hi rend="italic">Necho </hi>King of <hi rend="italic">AEgypt</hi>, <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0339" n="284"/>that is to say, because
						he rejected good Counsell though it seemed to come from an enemy, yet no man I hope will say that <hi rend="italic">Iosiah </hi>was by any bond either of <hi
							rend="italic">divine</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">humane Lawes</hi> obliged to beleeve <hi rend="italic">Pharoah Necho</hi> King of AEgypt, because he said <hi
							rend="italic">that God had spoken to him</hi>. But what some man may object against Kings, that for want of learning, they are seldome able enough to interpret those
						books of antiquity in the which Gods word is contained, and that for this cause it is not reasonable that this office should depend on their authority, he may object as
						much against the Priests, and all mortall men, for they may erre; and although Priests were better instructed in nature, and arts then other men, yet Kings are able
						enough to appoint such interpreters under them; and so, though Kings did not themselves interpret the word of God, yet the office of interpreting them might depend on
						their authority; and they who therefore refuse to yeeld up this authority to Kings, because they cannot practise the office it selfe, doe as much as if they should say
						that the authority of teaching <hi rend="italic">Geometry </hi>must not depend upon Kings, except they themselves were <hi rend="italic">Geometricians</hi>. We read
						that Kings have prayed for the People, that they have blest the people, that they have consecrated the Temple, that they have commanded the Priests, that they have
						removed Priests from their office, that they have constituted others. Sacrifices indeed they have not offered, for that was hereditary to <hi rend="italic">Aaron</hi>,
						and his sonnes; but it is manifest, as in <hi rend="italic">Moyses </hi>his life time, so throughout all ages from <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0340" n="285"/>King <hi rend="italic">Saul</hi> to the captivity of
							<hi rend="italic">Babylon</hi>, that the Priesthood was not a Maistry, but a Ministry. </p>
					<p> XVII. After their returne from Babylonian bondage, the <hi rend="italic">Covenant </hi>being renewed, and sign'd, <hi rend="italic">the Priestly Kingdome</hi> was
						restor'd to the same manner it was in from the death of <hi rend="italic">Ioshuah</hi> to the beginning of the Kings; excepting that it is not expresly set downe that
						the return'd <hi rend="italic">Jewes </hi>did give up the Right of Soveraignty either to <hi rend="italic">Esdras </hi>(by whose directions they ordred their State) or
						to any other, beside God himselfe. That reformation seemes rather to be nothing else then the bare promises, and vowes of every man to observe those things which were
						written in the booke of the Law. Notwithstanding, (perhaps not by the Peoples intention) by virtue of the <hi rend="italic">Covenant </hi>which they then renewed, (for
						the Covenant was the same with that which was made at Mount <hi rend="italic">Sinai</hi>) that same state was a <hi rend="italic">Priestly Kingdome</hi>, that is to
						say, the supreme civill authority, and the sacred were united in the Priests. Now, howsoever through the ambition of those who strove for the Priesthood, and by the
						interposition of forraigne Princes, it was so troubled till our Saviour <hi rend="italic">Iesus Christs</hi> time, that it cannot be understood out of the histories of
						those times, where that authority resided; yet it's plaine, that in those times, the power <hi rend="italic">of interpreting Gods Word</hi> was not severed from the
						supreme civill power. </p>
					<p> XVIII. Out of all this, we may easily know how the <hi rend="italic">Iewes </hi>in all times from <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>unto <hi rend="italic">Christ
					</hi>were to behave themselves<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0341" n="286"/>" in the Commands of their <hi rend="italic">Princes</hi>. For as in Kingdomes meerly humane men must obey a subordinate Magistrate in all
						things, excepting when his Commands containe in them some Treason; so in the Kingdome of God, the <hi rend="italic">Iewes </hi>were bound to obey their <hi
							rend="italic">Princes, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moyses,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Priest</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">King</hi>, every one during their time in all
						things, except when their commands did containe some <hi rend="italic">treason against the Divine Majesty</hi>. Now treason against the Divine Majesty was, first, <hi
							rend="italic">the deniall of his divine providence,</hi> for this was <hi rend="italic">to deny God to be a King by nature</hi>; next, <hi rend="italic"
						>Idolatry</hi>, or the worship not of other (for there is but one God) but of strange Gods, that is to say, a worship though of one God, yet under other <hi
							rend="italic">Titles</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Attributes</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Rites</hi>, then what were establisht by <hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>, and <hi
							rend="italic">Moyses</hi>. For this was to <hi rend="italic">deny the God </hi>of <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>to be their King <hi rend="italic">by Covenant</hi>
						made with <hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>, and themselves. In all other things they were to obey; and if a King or Priest having the Soveraign authority, had commanded
						somewhat else to be done which was against the Lawes, that had been his sinne, and not his subjects, whose duty it is, not to dispute, but to obey the Commands of his
						superiours.<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0342" n="297"/></p>

						the <hi rend="italic">Kingdome of God</hi> by a new <hi rend="italic">Covenant</hi>, partly foretelling his regall <hi rend="italic">Dignity</hi>, partly his <hi
							rend="italic">Humility </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi>. Among others concerning his Dignity, these; God blessing <hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>, makes him a
						promise of his sonne <hi rend="italic">Isaac</hi>, and addes, <hi rend="italic">And Kings of People shall be of him,</hi> Gen. 17. vers. 16. Jacob <hi rend="italic"
							>blessing his sonne</hi> Judah, <hi rend="italic">The Scepter (quoth he) shall not depart from</hi> Judah, Gen. 49. vers. 10. <hi rend="italic">God to</hi> Moyses,
						<hi rend="italic">A Prophet (saith he) will I raise them up from among their brethren like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0345"
							n="290"/>and he shall speak unto them
							all that I shall command him, and it shall come to Passe, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words, which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of
						him,</hi> Deut. 18. vers. 18. Isaias,<hi rend="italic"> The Lord himselfe shall give thee a signe, Behold a Virgin shall conceive, and bear a Sonne, and shall call his
							name</hi> Emanuel, Isai 7. v. 14. The same Prophet, <hi rend="italic">Unto us a child is born, unto us a Sonne is given, and the government shall be upon his
							shoulders; and his name shall be called Wonderfull, Counsellour, the mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace</hi>, Isai 9. vers. 6. And again, <hi
							rend="italic">There shall come forth a Rod out of the stemme of</hi> Jesse, <hi rend="italic">and a branch shall grow out of his roots; the spirit of the Lord shall
							rest upon him, &amp;amp;c. he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his eares, but with righteousnesse shall he judge
							the Poor, &amp;amp;c. and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked, </hi>Isay 11. vers. 1, 2,
						3, 4, 5. Furthermore in the 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 60, 61, 62. Ch. of the same Isay, there is almost nothing else contained but a description of the coming, and the works
						of Christ. Jeremias, <hi rend="italic">Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the house of </hi>Israel, <hi rend="italic">and with
							the house of</hi> Judah, Jerem. 31. 31. And <hi rend="italic">Baruch, This is our God. &amp;amp;c. Afterward did he shew himselfe upon earth, and conversed with
							men;</hi> Baruch 3. vers. 35, 37. Ezekiel, <hi rend="italic">I will set up one Shepheard over them, and he shall feed them, even my Servant</hi> David, <hi
								rend="italic">And I will make with them a Covenant of Peace,</hi> &amp;amp;c. Ezek. 34. vers. 23, 25. Daniel, <hi rend="italic">I saw in <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0346"
									n="291"/>the night visions, and
							behold one like the Sonne of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the antient of dayes, and they brought him near before him, and there was given him
							Dominion, and Glory, and a Kingdome, that all People, Nations, and Languages should serve him, his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion, &amp;amp;c.</hi> Dan. 7.
						vers. 13, 14. Haggai, <hi rend="italic">Yet once it is a little while, and I will shake the Heaven, and the Earth, and the Sea, and the drye Land, and I will shake all
							Nations, and the desire of all Nations shall come,</hi> Hagga 2. v. 8. Zachariah, Under the type of <hi rend="italic">Joshuah </hi>the High Priest: <hi rend="italic"
							>I will bring forth my servant the Branch, &amp;amp;c.</hi> Zach. 3. v. 8. And again, <hi rend="italic">Behold the man whose name is the Branch,</hi> Zach. 6. v.
						12. And again, Rejoyce greatly O Daughter of Sion, Shout O Daughter of Jerusalem, behold thy King cometh to thee, he is just, having salvation, Zach. 9. v. 9. The Jewes
						moved by these, and other Prophesies, expected Christ their King to be sent from God, who should redeem them, and furthermore bear rule over all Nations. Yea this
						Prophesie had spread over the whole Roman Empire (which <hi rend="italic">Vespasian </hi>too, though falsly, interpreted in favour of his own enterprises) <hi
							rend="italic">That out of</hi> Judea <hi rend="italic">should come he that should have dominion</hi>. </p>
					<p> II. Now the Prophesies <hi rend="italic">of Christs Humility and Passion</hi>, amongst others are these. Isa 53. v. 4 <hi rend="italic">He hath born our griefes, and
							carried our sorrowes; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, &amp; afflicted,</hi> and by and by, <hi rend="italic">He was oppressed, he was afflicted,
								yet he opened not his mouth; He is brought as a Lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her Shearer is dumb, so <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0347" n="292"/>opened he not his mouth,</hi> &amp;amp;c.
						vers. 7. And again, <hi rend="italic">He was cut out of the Land of the living,for the transgression of my People was he stricken, &amp;amp;c.</hi> vers. 8. <hi
							rend="italic">Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoyle with the strong, because he hath poured out his soule unto death,
							and he was numbred with the transgressours, and he bare the sinne of many, and made intercession for the transgressours,</hi> vers. 12. And that of <hi rend="italic"
							>Zachary, He is lowly, riding upon an Asse, and upon a Colt the foale of an Asse. </hi>Zach. 9. vers. 9. </p>
					<p> III. In the reign of <hi rend="italic">Tiberius Cesar, JESUS</hi> our Saviour a <hi rend="italic">Galilaean </hi>began to preach, the sonne (as was supposed) of <hi
							rend="italic">Joseph</hi>, declaring to the people of the Jewes, that the Kingdome of God expected by them, was now come; and that himselfe was a <hi rend="italic"
							>King</hi>, that is to say, <hi rend="italic">THE CHRIST:</hi> Explaining the <hi rend="italic">Law</hi>; choosing <hi rend="italic">twelve Apostles,</hi> and <hi
							rend="italic">seventy Disciples,</hi> after the number of the <hi rend="italic">Princes</hi> of the Tribes, and seventy Elders (according to the pattern of <hi
							rend="italic">Moyses</hi>) to the Ministry; <hi rend="italic">teaching the way of salvation </hi>by himselfe and them; purging the Temple; doing great signes, and
						fulfilling all those things which the Prophets had foretold of Christ to come. That this man, hated of the <hi rend="italic">Pharisees</hi>, (whose false doctrine and
						hypocriticall sanctity he had reproved) and by their means, of the People accused of unlawfull seeking for the Kingdome, and crucified, was the true <hi rend="italic"
							>CHRIST</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">King </hi>promised by God, and sent from his father to renew the <hi rend="italic">new Covenant</hi> between them and God, both
						the Evangelists doe shew (describing his Genealogie, <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0348" n="293"/>nativity, life, doctrine, death, and resurrection) and by comparing the things which he did, with those which were
						foretold of him, all Christians doe consent to. </p>
					<p> IV. Now from this, That CHRIST was sent from God his Father to make a <hi rend="italic">Covenant </hi>between him and the people, it is manifest, that though Christ
						were equall to his Father according to his nature, yet was he inferior according to the Right of the Kingdom; for this office to speak properly, was not that of a King,
						but of a Vice-roy, such as <hi rend="italic">Moyses </hi>his Government was. For the Kingdom was not his, but his <hi rend="italic">Fathers</hi>; which CHRIST himselfe
						signified when he was baptized as a subject, and openly profest, when he taught his Disciples to pray, <hi rend="italic">Our Father, Thy Kingdome come,</hi>
						&amp;amp;c. And when he said,<hi rend="italic"> I will not drink of the blood of the grape, untill that day when I shall drink it new with you in the Kingdome of my
							Father,</hi> Mat. 26. vers. 29. And Saint <hi rend="italic">Paul</hi>. <hi rend="italic">As in</hi> Adam <hi rend="italic">all die, so in Christ shall all be made
							alive; but every man in his own order; Christ the first fruits, afterward they that are Christs, who beleeved in his coming; Then cometh the end when he shall have
							delivered up the Kingdom to God even his Father,</hi> &amp;amp;c. 1. Cor. 15. vers. 22, 23, 24. The same notwithstanding is also called the <hi rend="italic"
							>Kingdome of Christ</hi>: for both the Mother of the sonnes of <hi rend="italic">Zebedie </hi>petitioned Christ, saying, <hi rend="italic">Grant that these my two
							sonnes may sit, the one on thy right hand, the other on thy left, in thy Kingdome,</hi> Mat. 20. vers. 21. And the Theef on the Cross, <hi rend="italic">Lord remember
							me when thou comest into thy Kingdom,</hi> Luke 23. vers. 42. And Saint <hi rend="italic">Paul, For this know yee, that no whormonger,<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0349"
								n="294"/>" &amp;amp;c. shall enter
							into the Kingdome of God, and of Christ,</hi> Ephes. 5. ver. 5. And elsewhere,<hi rend="italic"> I charge thee before God, and the Lord Iesus Christ, who shall judge
							the quick and dead at his appearing, and his Kingdome, &amp; c.</hi> 2 Tim. 4. ver. 1. <hi rend="italic">And the Lord shall deliver me from every evill worke, and
							will Preserve me unto his heavenly Kingdome,</hi> ver. 18. Nor is it to be marvelled at, that the same Kingdome is attributed to them both, since both the Father, and
						the Son, are the same God; and the new Covenant concerning Gods Kingdome, is not propounded in the Name of the FATHER, but in the name of the FATHER, of the SON, and of
						the HOLY-GHOST, as of one God. </p>
					<p> V. But the Kingdome of God, for restitution whereof <hi rend="italic">CHRIST</hi> was sent from God his Father, takes not its beginning before his second comming, to
						wit, from the day of Judgement, when he shall come in Majesty accompanied with his Angels: For it is promis'd the Apostles, that in the Kingdome of God, they shall
						judge the twelve tribes of <hi rend="italic">Israel. Ye which have followed me in the regeneration, when the Sonne of man shall sit in the Throne of his glory, ye also
							shall sit upon twelve Thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel,</hi> Mat. 19. ver. 28. which is not to be done till the day of judgement; <hi rend="italic">CHRIST
						</hi>therefore is not yet in the throne of his Majesty, nor is that time when <hi rend="italic">CHRIST </hi>was conversant here in the world call'd a Kingdome, but a
						<hi rend="italic">regeneration</hi>, that is to say a renovation, or restitution of the Kingdome of God, and a calling of them who were hereafter to be receiv'd <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0350" n="295"/>into
						his Kingdome; And where it is said, <hi rend="italic">When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then shall he sit uPon the throne
							of his glory, and before him shall be gathered all Nations, and he shall seParate them one from another, as a Shepheard divideth his Sheep from the Goates</hi>, Mat.
						25. ver. 31. we may manifestly gather, that there will be no Locall separation of Gods Subjects from his Enemies, but that they shall live mixt together untill <hi
							rend="italic">CHRISTS </hi>second comming. Which is also confirm'd by the comparison of the Kingdome of heaven, with wheat mingled with Darnell; and with a net
						containing all sorts of fish. But a multitude of men, Enemies and Subjects, living promiscuously together, cannot properly be term'd a Kingdome. Besides, the Apostles,
						when they askt our Saviour, Whether he would at that time when he ascended into heaven, restore the Kingdome unto Israel? did openly testifie, that they then, when
						CHRIST ascended, thought the Kingdome of God not to be yet come. Farthermore, the words of CHRIST, <hi rend="italic">My Kingdome is not of this world;</hi> And, <hi
							rend="italic">I will not drinke, &amp;amp;c. till the Kingdome of God come:</hi> And, <hi rend="italic">God hath not sent his Son into the World, to judge the
							World, but that the World through him might be sav'd.</hi> And, <hi rend="italic">If any man heare not my words, and keepe them, I judge him not; for I came not to
							judge the World, but to save the World.</hi> And, <hi rend="italic">Man, who made me a judge or divider betweene you</hi>? And the very Appellation of the <hi
								rend="italic">Kingdome of Heaven</hi> testifies as much. The same thing is gathered out of the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0351" n="296"/>words of the Prophet <hi rend="italic">Jeremiah</hi>, speaking of the
						Kingdome of God by the new Covenant, <hi rend="italic">They shall teach no more every man his Neighbour, saying, Know the Lord, for they shall all know me from the
							least of them, to the greatest of them, saith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 31. v. 34. which cannot be understood of a Kingdome in this World. The Kingdome of God therefore,
						for the restoring whereof CHRIST came into the world, of which the Prophets did Prophesie, and of which praying wee say, <hi rend="italic">Thy Kingdome come,</hi> (if
						it must have Subjects locally separated from Enemies, if judicature, if Majesty, according as hath beene foretold,) shall begin from that time, wherein God shall
						separate the Sheep from the Goats; wherein the Apostles shall judge the twelve Tribes of <hi rend="italic">Israel</hi>; wherein CHRIST shall come in Majesty, and glory;
						wherein Lastly, all men shall so know God, that they shall not need to be taught, that is to say, at CHRIST his second comming, or the day of Judgement. But if the
						Kingdome of God were now already restor'd, no reason could be rendered why CHRIST having compleated the work for which he was sent, should come againe, or why we should
						pray, <hi rend="italic">Thy Kingdome come</hi>. </p>
					<p> VI. Now, although the Kingdome <hi rend="italic">of God</hi> by CHRIST to be establisht with a <hi rend="italic">new Covenant</hi>, were Heavenly, we must not
						therefore thinke, that they, who beleeving in CHRIST would make that Covenant, were not so to be govern'd here on the Earth too, as that they should persevere in their
						faith, and obedience <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0352" n="297"/>promis'd by that Covenant. For in vaine had the Kingdome of heaven beene promis'd, if we were not to have been led into it. But none can be led,
						but those who are directed in the way. <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>, when he had instituted the <hi rend="italic">Priestly Kingdome,</hi> himselfe though he were no
						Priest, yet rul'd, and conducted the People all the time of their Peregrination untill their entrance into the promis'd Land. In the same manner is it our Saviours
						office (whom God in this thing would have like unto <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>) as he was sent from his Father, so to governe the future Subjects of his heavenly
						Kingdome in this life, that they might attaine to, and enter into that, although the Kingdome were not properly his, but his Fathers. But the government whereby CHRIST
						rules the faithfull ones in this life, is not properly a <hi rend="italic">Kingdome</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Dominion</hi>, but a <hi rend="italic">Pastorall
						charge</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">the Right of teaching</hi>, that is to say, God the father gave him not a power <hi rend="italic">to judge</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
							>Meum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tuum </hi>as he doth to the Kings of the Earth; nor a <hi rend="italic">Coercive power</hi>; nor <hi rend="italic">legislative</hi>;
						but of shewing to the world, and <hi rend="italic">teaching them the way, and knowledge of Salvation</hi>, that is to say, of Preaching, and declaring what they were to
						doe, who would enter into the Kingdome <hi rend="italic">of Heaven</hi>. That CHRIST had receiv'd no power from his father to judge in questions of <hi rend="italic"
							>Meum </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Tuum</hi>, that is to say, in all questions of Right among those who beleev'd not; those words above cited doe sufficiently declare:
						<hi rend="italic">Man, who made me a judge, or divider betweene you</hi>? And it is confirm'd by reason; for seeing <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0353" n="298"/>CHRIST was sent to make <hi rend="italic">a
							Covenant</hi> between God and men, and no man is oblig'd to performe obedience before the Contract be made, if he should have judg'd of Questions of <hi rend="italic"
							>Right</hi>, no man had been tyed to obey his sentence. But that the discerning of Right was not committed to CHRIST in this world, neither among the faithfull, nor
						among infidels, is apparent in this, that that Right without all controversie belongs to Princes as long as it is not by, But it is not derogated God himselfe derogated
						from their authority; before the day of Judgement, as appeares by the words of Saint <hi rend="italic">Paul</hi>, speaking of the day of Judgement, <hi rend="italic"
							>Then commeth the end when He shall have delivered up the Kingdome to God even the Father, when He shall have put downe all rule, and all authority, and power</hi>, 1
						Cor. 15. ver. 24. Secondly, the words of our Saviour reproving <hi rend="italic">James</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Iohn</hi>, when they had said, <hi rend="italic">Wilt
							thou that we call for Fyer from Heaven, that it may consume them</hi> (namely the <hi rend="italic">Samaritans</hi>, who had denyed to receive him going up to <hi
							rend="italic">Jerusalem</hi>) and replying, <hi rend="italic">The Son of Man is not come to destroy soules, but to save them</hi>; And those words, <hi rend="italic"
							>Behold I send you as Sheep among Wolves; Shake off the dust of your Feet</hi>, and the like; And those words, <hi rend="italic">God sent not his Son into the world,
							to judge the world, but that the world through him might be sav'd;</hi> and those, <hi rend="italic">If any man heare my words, and keep them not, I judge him not,
							for I came not to judge the world, &amp; c.</hi> doe all shew, that he had no power given him, to condemne or punish any man. We reade <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0354"
								n="299"/>indeed that the <hi
							rend="italic">Father judgeth no Man, but hath committed all judgement to the Son,</hi> but since that both may, and must be understood of the day of future judgement,
						it doth not at all repugne what hath beene sayed before. Lastly, that he was not sent to make new Lawes, and that therefore by his Office, and mission, he was no
						Legislatour properly so called, nor <hi rend="italic">Moyses </hi>neither, but a bringer and Publisher of his Fathers Lawes, (for God only, and neither <hi
							rend="italic">Moyses</hi>, nor CHRIST, was a King by Covenant) is collected hence, that he sayed, <hi rend="italic">I came not to destroy</hi> (to wit the Lawes
						before given from God by <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>, which he presently interprets) <hi rend="italic">but to fulfill</hi>; And, <hi rend="italic">He that shall break
							one of the least of these Commandements, and shall teach men so, He shall be called least in the Kingdome of Heaven</hi>. CHRIST therefore had not a Royall, or
						Soveraigne power committed to him from his Father in this world, but consiliary, and doctrinall onely; which himselfe signifies, as well then when he call his Apostles,
						not Hunters, but Fishers of men; as when he compares the Kingdome of God to a graine of mustard seed, and to a little Leaven hid in meale. </p>
					<p> VII. God promis'd unto <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>first, a numerous seed, the possession of the Land of <hi rend="italic">Canaan</hi>, and a blessing upon all
						Nations in his seed, on this Condition, that he, and his seed should serve him; next unto the seed of <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>according to the flesh, a <hi
							rend="italic">Priestly </hi>Kingdome, a Government most free, in which they were to be Subject to no humane power, on this <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0355" n="300"/>Condition, that they should serve the God
						of <hi rend="italic">Abraham </hi>on that fashion which <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi> should teach. Lastly, both to them, and to all Nations, a heavenly, and <hi
							rend="italic">eternall </hi>Kingdome, on Condition that they should serve the God of <hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>, on that manner which Christ should teach. For by
							<hi rend="italic">the new</hi>, that is to say, <hi rend="italic">the Christian Covenant</hi>, it's covenanted on mens part, to serve the God of <hi rend="italic"
							>Abraham, on that manner which</hi> JESUS <hi rend="italic">should teach:</hi> On Gods part, <hi rend="italic">to pardon their sinnes, and bring them into his
							caelestiall Kingdome.</hi> We have already spoken of the quality of the <hi rend="italic">heavenly </hi>Kingdome above in the 5. Article; but it is usually call'd,
						sometimes the <hi rend="italic">Kingdome of Heaven</hi>, sometimes the <hi rend="italic">Kingdome of Glory</hi>, sometimes the <hi rend="italic">life Eternall.</hi>
						What's required on mens part, namely to serve God as CHRIST should teach, containes two things, <hi rend="italic">Obedience to be performed to God,</hi> (for this is to
						serve God) and <hi rend="italic">Faith in </hi>JESUS, to wit, That we beleeve JESUS TO BE THAT CHRIST who was promis'd by God: for that only is the cause why his
						Doctrine is to be followed, rather then any others. Now in holy Scriptures, <hi rend="italic">Repentance</hi> is often put in stead of <hi rend="italic">Obedience</hi>, because Christ teacheth every where, that
						with God the Will is taken for the deed; but <hi rend="italic">Repentance </hi>is an infallible sign of an obedient mind. These things being understood, it will most
						evidently appear out of many places of sacred Scripture, that those are the Conditions of <hi rend="italic">the Christian Covenant</hi> which we have nam'd, to wit,
						giving remission of sins, and eternall life <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0356" n="301"/>on Gods part; and Repenting, and Beleeving in JESUS CHRIST, on Mens part. First, the words, <hi rend="italic">The Kingdom of
							God is at hand. Repent yee and beleeve the Gospell,</hi> Mark 1. 15. contain the whole Covenant: In like manner those, <hi rend="italic">Thus it is written, and thus
							it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day; and that repentance, and remission of sinnes should be preached in his Name among all Nations,
							begining at Jerusalem,</hi> Luke 24. vers. 46, 47. And those, <hi rend="italic">Repent and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of
							refreshing shall come,</hi> &amp;amp;c. Acts 3. vers. 19. And sometimes one part is expresly propounded, and the other understood, as here, <hi rend="italic">He
							that beleeveth in the Sonne, hath everlasting life; He that beleeveth not the Sonne, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> Iohn 3. vers. 36,
						Where <hi rend="italic">Faith </hi>is exprest, <hi rend="italic">Repentance </hi>not mentioned. And in CHRISTS preaching, <hi rend="italic">Repent, for the Kingdome of
							heaven is at hand,</hi> Mat. 4. 17. Where <hi rend="italic">Repentance </hi>is exprest, <hi rend="italic">Faith </hi>is understood. But the parts of this <hi
							rend="italic">new Contract</hi> are most manifestly, and formally set down there, where a certain Ruler bargaining as it were for the Kingdom of God, asketh our
						Saviour, <hi rend="italic">Good Master, what shall I doe to inherit eternall life,</hi> Luke 18. v. 18. But CHRIST first propounds one part of the price, namely
						observation of the Commandements, or obedience, which when he answered that he had kept, he adjoynes the other, saying, <hi rend="italic">Yet lackest thou one thing;
							Sell all that thou hast, and distribute to the Poor, and thou shalt have Treasure in Heaven, and come, follow me,</hi> v. 22. This <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0357" n="302"/>was matter of <hi rend="italic"
							>Faith</hi>. He therefore not giving sufficient credit to CHRIST, and his heavenly Treasures, went away sorrowfull. The same Covenant is contained in these words: <hi
							rend="italic">Hee that beleeveth, and is baptized, shall be saved, he that beleeveth not, shall be damned,</hi> Mark 16. vers. 15, 16. Where <hi rend="italic">Faith
						</hi>is exprest, <hi rend="italic">Repentance</hi> is supposed in those that are baptized; and in these words, <hi rend="italic">Except a man be born again of water,
							and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> Iohn 3. vers. 5. Where <hi rend="italic">to be born of water</hi>, is the same with
						regeneration, that is to say, Conversion to CHRIST. Now that <hi rend="italic">Baptisme </hi>is required in the two places cited just before, and in divers others, we
						must understand, that what <hi rend="italic">Circumcision </hi>was to the <hi rend="italic">old Covenant</hi>, that <hi rend="italic">Baptisme </hi>is to the <hi
							rend="italic">new</hi>: Seeing therefore, that was not of the Essence, but served for a memoriall of the <hi rend="italic">old Covenant</hi>, as a Ceremony or signe
						(and was omitted in the wildernesse) in like manner this also is used, not as pertaining to the Essence, but in memory, and for a signe of the <hi rend="italic">New
							Covenant</hi> which wee make with God; and provided the will be not wanting, the Act through necessity may be omitted; but <hi rend="italic">Repentance </hi>and <hi
							rend="italic">Faith</hi>, which are of the Essence of the <hi rend="italic">Covenant</hi>, are alwayes required. </p>
					<p> VIII. In the <hi rend="italic">Kingdome </hi>of God after this life there will be no, <hi rend="italic">Lawes</hi>. partly because there is no roome for Lawes, where
						there is none for sinne; partly because Laws were given us from God, not to direct us in <hi rend="italic">Heaven</hi>, but unto <hi rend="italic">Heaven</hi>. Let us
						now therefore <hi rend="italic">enquire what Laws CHRIST </hi><pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0358" n="303"/>(establisht not himselfe, for he would not take upon him any Legislative authority, as hath been declared
						above in the sixth Article, but) propounded to us for his Fathers. Wee have a place in Scripture, where he contracts all the <hi rend="italic">Lawes of God
						</hi>publisht till that time, into two Preceps, <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy minde: this
							is the greatest, and first Commandement. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy selfe. On these two Commandements hangs all the Law, and
							the Prophets,</hi> Mat. 22. vers. 37, 38, 39, 40. The first of these was given before by <hi rend="italic">Moyses </hi>in the same words, <hi rend="italic">Deut</hi>.
						6. vers. 5. And the second even before <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>; for it is the naturall Law, having its begining with rationall nature it selfe. And both together
						is the summe of all Lawes: for all the Lawes of divine naturall worship, are contained in these words, <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt love God;</hi> and all the Lawes of
						divine worship due by the <hi rend="italic">old Covenant</hi>, in these words, <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt love thy God,</hi> that is to say, <hi rend="italic">God
						</hi>as being the peculiar <hi rend="italic">King of Abraham,</hi> and his seed; and all the Lawes naturall, and civill, in these words, <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt
							love thy Neighbour as thy selfe</hi>. For he that loves God and his neighbour, hath a minde to obey all Lawes, both divine, and humane. But God requires no more then
						a minde to obey. Wee have another place, where CHRIST interprets the Lawes, namely, the fifth, sixth, and seventh entire Chapters of Saint <hi rend="italic"
						>Matthewes</hi> Gospell. But all those Lawes are set down, either in the <hi rend="italic">Decalogue</hi>, or in the <hi rend="italic">morall Law</hi>, or are contained
						<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0359" n="304"/>in <hi rend="italic">the faith of Abraham</hi>; as that Law of not putting away a wife is contained in <hi rend="italic">the faith</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
						>Abraham</hi>: for that same, <hi rend="italic">Two shall be one flesh,</hi> was not delivered either by CHRIST first, or by <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>, but by <hi
							rend="italic">Abraham</hi>, who first publisht the Creation of the world. The Lawes therefore which CHRIST contracts in one place, and explaines in another, are no
						other then those to which all mortall men are obliged, who acknowledge the God of <hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>. Beside these, we read not of any Law given by CHRIST,
						beside the institution of the Sacraments of <hi rend="italic">Baptisme</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Eucharist</hi>. </p>
					<p> IX. What may be said then of these kinde of Precepts: <hi rend="italic">Repent, Be Baptized, Keep the Commandements, Beleeve the Gospell, Come unto me, Sell all that
							thou hast, give to the Poor, follow me, and the like</hi>? We must say that they are not <hi rend="italic">Lawes</hi>, but a calling of us to <hi rend="italic">the
							faith</hi>, such as is that of <hi rend="italic">Isa. Come, buy wine, and milk without monie, and without Price,</hi> Isai 55. vers. 1. Neither if they come not, doe
						they therefore sinne against any Law, but against prudence onely; neither shall their <hi rend="italic">infidelity </hi>be punisht, but their former sinnes. Wherefore
						Saint <hi rend="italic">John </hi>saith of the unbeleever, <hi rend="italic">The wrath of God abideth on him</hi>; he saith not, <hi rend="italic">The wrath of God
							shall come upon him</hi>; And, <hi rend="italic">He that beleeveth not, is already judged</hi>; he saith not, <hi rend="italic">shall be judged, but is already
						judged</hi>. Nay it cannot be well conceived, that <hi rend="italic">remission of sinnes</hi> should be a benefit arising from <hi rend="italic">faith</hi>, unlesse we
						understand also on the other side, that the punishment of sinnes is an hurt proceeding from <hi rend="italic">infidelity</hi>. <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0360" n="305"/></p>
					<p> X. From hence, that our Saviour hath prescribed no distributive Lawes, to the Subjects of Princes, and Citizens of Cities, that is to say, hath given no rules whereby
						a Subject may know, and discerne what is <hi rend="italic">his owne</hi>, what <hi rend="italic">another mans</hi>, not by what forms, words, or circumstances, a thing
						must be <hi rend="italic">given, delivered, invaded, possest,</hi> that it may be known by Right to belong to the <hi rend="italic">Receiver, Invader,</hi> or <hi
							rend="italic">Possessour</hi>, we must necessarily understand that each single subject (not only with unbeleevers, among whom CHRIST himselfe denyed himselfe to be
							<hi rend="italic">a judge</hi> and <hi rend="italic">distributer</hi>, but even with Christians) must take those rules from his City, that is to say, from that Man,
						or Councell, which hath the supreme power It. followes therefore, that by those Lawes,<hi rend="italic"> Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt
							not steale, Honour thy Father and Mother,</hi> nothing else was commanded, but that Subjects, and Citizens, should absolutely obey their Princes in all questions
						concerning <hi rend="italic">Meum &amp; Tuum, their own</hi> and <hi rend="italic">others Right</hi>. For by that Precept, <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt not
						kill</hi>, all slaughter is not prohibited; for he that said, <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt not kill,</hi> said also, <hi rend="italic">Whosoever doth work upon the
							Sabbath, shall be put to death,</hi> Exod 35. vers. 2. No, nor yet all slaughter the cause not being heard; for he said, <hi rend="italic">Slay every man his Brother,
							and every man his Companion, and every man his Neighbour,</hi> Exo. 32. v. 27. And there fell of the People about three thousand men, v. 28. Nor yet all slaughter of
						an innocent Person; for <hi rend="italic">Iephte</hi> vowed,<hi rend="italic"> Whosoever cometh forth,</hi> &amp;amp;c. <hi rend="italic">I will offer him up for a
							burnt offering unto the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0361" n="306"/>Lord,</hi> Jud. 11. vers. 31. and his vow was accepted of God. What then is forbidden? Onely this: that no man kill another, who hath not a
							<hi rend="italic">Right </hi>to kill him, that is to say, that no man kill, unlesse it belong to him to doe so. The Law of CHRIST therefore concerning killing, and
						consequently all manner of hurt done to any man, and what penalties are to be set, commands us to obey the City only. In like manner, by that Precept, <hi rend="italic"
							>Thou shalt not commit adultery,</hi> all manner of Copulation is not forbidden, but only that of lying with <hi rend="italic">another mans wife</hi>; but the
						judgment which is another mans wife, belongs to the City, and is to be determined by the rules which the City prescribes: This precept therefore commands both male and
						female to keep that faith intire which they have mutually given, according to the statutes of the City. So also by the precept, <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt not
						steal</hi>, all manner of invasion, or secret surreption is not forbidden, but of <hi rend="italic">another mans</hi> only. The subject therefore is commanded this
						only, that he invade not, nor take away ought which the City prohibits to be invaded or taken away; and universally not to call any thing <hi rend="italic">murder,
							adultery,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">theft</hi>, but what is done contrary to the civill Lawes. Lastly, seeing CHRIST hath commanded us to <hi rend="italic">honour our
							Parents</hi>, and hath not prescribed, with what Rites, what appellations, and what manner of obedience they are to be honoured, it is to be supposed that they are to
						be honoured with the will indeed, and inwardly, as Kings and Lords over their Children, but outwardly, not <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0362" n="307"/>beyond the Cities permission, which shall assign <hi
							rend="italic">to every man</hi> (as all things else, so also) <hi rend="italic">his honour</hi>. But since the nature of justice consists in this, that every Man have
						his own given him, its manifest, that it also belongs to a Christian City to determin what is justice, what injustice, or a sinne against justice; Now what belongs to a
						City, that must be judg'd to belong to him or them who have the Soveraigne power of the City. </p>
					<p> XI. Moreover, because our Saviour hath not shewed Subjects any other Lawes for the government of a City beside those of nature, that is to say, beside the Command of
						obedience, no Subject can privately determine who is a publique friend, who an enemy, when Warre, when Peace, when Truce is to be made; nor yet what Subjects, what
						authority, and of what men, are commodious, or prejudiciall to the safety of the Common-weale. These, and all like matters therefore are to be learned, if need be, from
						the City, that is to say, from the Soveraign powers. </p>
					<p> XII. Furthermore, all these things, to build Castles, Houses, Temples; to move, carry, take away mighty weights; to send securely over Seas; to contrive engines,
						serving for all manner of uses; to be well acquainted with the face of the whole world, the Courses of the Starres, the seasons of the yeare, the accounts of the times,
						and the nature of all things; to understand perfectly all naturall and civill Rights; and all manner of Sciences, which (comprehended under the Title of Philosophy) are
						<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0363" n="308"/>necessary partly to live, partly to live well; I say, the understanding of these (because CHRIST hath not delivered it) is to be learnt from reasoning, that is to say
						by making necessary consequences, having first taken the beginning from experience. But mens reasonings are sometimes right, sometimes wrong, and consequently that
						which is concluded, and held for a truth, is sometimes truth, sometimes errour. Now, errours even about these Philosophicall points doe sometimes publique hurt, and
						give occasions of great seditions, and injuries: It is needfull therefore, as oft as any controversie ariseth in these matters contrary to publique good, and common
						Peace, that there be some body to judge of the reasoning, that is to say, whether that which is inferred, be rightly inferred or not, that so the controversie may be
						ended. But there are no rules given by CHRIST to this purpose; neither came he into the world to teach <hi rend="italic">Logick</hi>. It remaines therefore that the
						Iudges of such controversies be the same with those whom God by nature had instituted before, namely those who in each City are constituted by the Soveraign. Moreover,
						if a controversie be raised of the accurate and proper signification (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>) the definition of those names or appellations which are commonly
						us'd, in so much as it is needfull for the peace of the City, or the distribution of right, to be determin'd, the determination will belong to the City; for men by
						reasoning doe search out such kind of definitions in their observation of diverse conceptions, for the signification <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0364" n="309"/>whereof, those appellations were us'd at divers
						times, and for divers causes. But the decision of the question whether a man doe reason rightly, belongs to the City. For Example. If a woman bring forth a Child of an
						unwonted shape, and the Law forbid to kill a man, the question is, whether the Childe be a man. It is demanded therefore what a man is. No man doubts, but the City
						shall judge it, and that without taking an account of <hi rend="italic">Aristotles </hi>definition, that man is a rationall Creature. And these things (namely <hi
							rend="italic">Right, Politie</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">naturall Sciences</hi>) are Subjects concerning which CHRIST denies that it belongs to his Office to give any
						Praecepts, or teach any thing, beside this onely, that in all Controversies about them, every single Subject should obey the Lawes, and determinations of his City. Yet
						must we remember this, that the same Christ as God could not onely have taught, but also commanded what he would. </p>
					<p> XIII. The summe of our Saviours Office was to teach the way, and all the meanes of Salvation, and aeternall life; but <hi rend="italic">Iustice</hi> and <hi
							rend="italic">civill obedience</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">observation </hi>of all the <hi rend="italic">naturall </hi>Lawes is one of the meanes to Salvation. Now
						these may be taught two wayes; one, as <hi rend="italic">Theorems </hi>by the way of naturall reason, by drawing Right and the natural Lawes from humane Principles, and
						contracts; and this Doctrine thus deliver'd is subject to the censure of civill powers: The other, as Lawes, by divine authority, in shewing the will of God to be such;
						and thus to teach, belongs <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0365" n="310"/>onely to him to whom the Will of God is supernaturally knowne, that is to say, to <hi rend="italic">Christ</hi>. Secondly, it belong'd to the
						Office of <hi rend="italic">Christ </hi>to forgive sinnes to the Penitent, for that was necessary for the Salvation of men who had already sinn'd; neither could it be
						done by any other; for remission of sinnes followes not Repentance naturally, (as a Debt) but it depends (as a free gift) on the will of God supernaturally to be
						reveal'd. Thirdly, it belongs to the Office of Christ to teach all those Commandements of God, whether concerning his worship, or those points of faith which cannot be
						understood by naturall reason, but onely by revelation; of which nature are those <hi rend="italic">that he was the Christ; that his Kingdome was not terrestriall, but
							celestiall; that there are rewards, and punishments after this life; that the soule is immortall; that there should be such, and so many Sacraments,</hi> and the
						like. </p>
					<p> XIV. From what hath beene sayed in the foregoing Chapter, it is not hard to distinguish betweene things <hi rend="italic">Spirituall</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
							>Temporall</hi>. For since by <hi rend="italic">Spirituall</hi>, those things are understood which have their foundation on the authority, and Office of CHRIST, and
						unlesse CHRIST had taught them, could not have beene known; and all other things are temporall; it followes, that the definition, and determination of whats <hi
							rend="italic">just</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi>, the cognizance of all controversies about the <hi rend="italic">meanes of Peace</hi>, and <hi
								rend="italic">publique defence</hi>, and the Examination of doctrines, and books in all manner of <hi rend="italic">rationall science, depends upon the <pb
									entity="DSSR_000002537_0366" n="311"/>temporall
							Right</hi>. But those which are <hi rend="italic">mysteries of faith</hi>, depending on CHRIST his word, and authority onely, their judgements belong to <hi
							rend="italic">spirituall Right</hi>. But it is reasons inquisition, and pertaines to <hi rend="italic">temporall Right</hi> to define what is <hi rend="italic"
							>spirituall</hi>, and what <hi rend="italic">temporall</hi>, because our Saviour hath not made that distinction; For although Saint <hi rend="italic">Paul </hi>in
						many places distinguish betweene <hi rend="italic">spirituall things,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">carnall </hi>things, and calls those things <hi rend="italic"
							>spirituall</hi>, which are of the <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi>, to wit, the <hi rend="italic">word of wisdome, the word of knowledge, faith, the gift of healing,
							the working of miracles, Prophesie, divers kindes of tongues, interpretation of tongues,</hi> Rom. 8. 5. 1 Cor. 12. 8, 9. All supernaturally inspired by the <hi
							rend="italic">Holy Ghost</hi>, and such as the carnall <hi rend="italic">man </hi>understands not, but he only who hath known the mind of CHRIST, 2. <hi rend="italic"
							>Cor</hi>. 2. 14, 15, 16. And those things <hi rend="italic">carnall </hi>which belong to worldly wealth, Rom. 15. 27. And the men <hi rend="italic">carnall men,</hi>
						1 Cor. 3. vers. 1, 2, 3. yet hath he not defined, nor given us any rules whereby we may know what proceeds from naturall reason, what from supernaturall inspiration. </p>
					<p> XV. Seeing therefore it is plain that our Saviour hath committed to, or rather not taken away from <hi rend="italic">Princes</hi>, and those who in each City have
						obtained the Soveraignty, the supreme authority of judging &amp; determineing al manner of controversies about <hi rend="italic">temporall matters</hi>, we must see
						henceforth to whom he hath left the same authority in matters <hi rend="italic">spirituall</hi>. Which because it cannot bee known, except it be out of <hi
							rend="italic">the word of God</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">the Tradition of the Church,</hi> we must <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0367" n="312"/>enquire in the next place what <hi rend="italic">the word of God
							is,</hi> what <hi rend="italic">to interpret it,</hi> what a <hi rend="italic">Church </hi>is, and what <hi rend="italic">the will and command of the Church</hi>. To
						omit that the <hi rend="italic">word of God</hi> is in Scripture taken sometimes for the <hi rend="italic">Sonne of God</hi>, it is used, three manner of wayes; First,
						most properly for that which God hath spoken; Thus whatsoever God spake unto <hi rend="italic">Abraham</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Patriarchs, Moses,</hi> and the <hi
							rend="italic">Prophets</hi>, our Saviour to his Disciples, or any others, is <hi rend="italic">the word of God</hi>. Secondly, whatsoever hath been uttered by men on
						the motion, or by Command of the Holy Ghost; in which sense we acknowledge the Scriptures to be the <hi rend="italic">word of God</hi>. Thirdly, in the New Testament
						indeed the <hi rend="italic">word of God</hi> most frequently signifies the Doctrine of the Gospell, or the <hi rend="italic">word concerning God</hi>, or <hi
							rend="italic">the word of the Kingdome of God</hi> by CHRIST: as where it is said that CHRIST preach't the <hi rend="italic">Gospell of the Kingdome</hi>, Mat. 4.
						vers. 23. Where the <hi rend="italic">Apostles </hi>are said to preach <hi rend="italic">the word of God,</hi> Acts 13. vers. 46. Where <hi rend="italic">the word of
							God</hi> is called <hi rend="italic">the word of life</hi>, Acts 5. vers. 20. <hi rend="italic">The word of the Gospell,</hi> Acts 15. vers. 7. <hi rend="italic">The
							word of faith,</hi> Rom. 10. vers. 8. <hi rend="italic">The word of truth</hi>, that is to say, (adding an interpretation) <hi rend="italic">The Gospel of
						salvation</hi>, Eph. 1. 13. And where it is called <hi rend="italic">the word of the Apostles;</hi> For Saint <hi rend="italic">Paul </hi>sayes, <hi rend="italic">If
							any man obey not our word,</hi> &amp;amp;c. 2. Thess. 3. vers. 14. which places cannot be otherwise meant then of <hi rend="italic">the doctrine
						Evangelicall.</hi> In like manner where the word of God is said to be <hi rend="italic">sowen, to encrease</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">to be multiplied</hi>, Acts 12.
						vers. 24. and Chap. 13. vers. 49. it is very hard to <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0368" n="313"/>conceive this to be spoken of the <hi rend="italic">voyce of God</hi>, or of his <hi rend="italic">Apostles</hi>;
						but of their doctrine, easie. And in this third acception is all that <hi rend="italic">doctrine of the Christian faith</hi> which at this day is preacht in Pulpits,
						and contained in the books of divines, the <hi rend="italic">word of God</hi>. </p>
					<p> XVI. Now the sacred Scripture is intirely the word of God in this second acception, as being that which we acknowledge to be inspired from God. And innumerable places
						of it, in the first. And seeing the greatest part of it is conversant either in the prediction of the <hi rend="italic">Kingdome of Heaven</hi>, or in prefigurations
						before the incarnation of CHRIST, or in Evangelization, and explication after, The sacred Scripture is also <hi rend="italic">the word of God</hi>, and therefore the
							<hi rend="italic">Canon </hi>and Rule of all <hi rend="italic">Evangelicall Doctrine</hi>, in this third signification, where <hi rend="italic">the word of God</hi>
						is taken for <hi rend="italic">the word concerning God</hi>, that is to say, for <hi rend="italic">the Gospel</hi>. But because in the same Scriptures we read many
						things <hi rend="italic">Politicall, Historicall, Morall, Physicall,</hi> and others which nothing at all concern the <hi rend="italic">Mysteries of our faith,</hi>
						those places although they contain true doctrine, and are the Canon of such kind of doctrines, yet can they not be the Canon of the Mysteries of Christian Religion. </p>
					<p> XVII. And truly it is not the dead voyce, or letter of <hi rend="italic">the word of God</hi>, which is the Canon of Christian doctrine, but a true and genuine
						determination; For the minde is not governed by Scriptures, unlesse they be understood. There is need therefore of an Interpreter to make the Scriptures Canon. And
						hence followes one of <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0369" n="314"/>these two things, that either the word of the Interpreter is the word of God, or that the Canon of Christian doctrin is not the word of God. The
						last of these must necessarily be false; for the rule of that doctrine which cannot be knowne by any humane reason, but by divine revelation only, cannot be lesse then
						divine; for whom we acknowledge not to be able to discern whether some doctrin be true or not, its impossible to account his opinion for a rule in the same doctrine.
						The first therefore is true, <hi rend="italic">That the word of an Interpreter of Scriptures, is the word of God</hi>. </p>
					<p> XVIII. Now that Interpreter whose determination hath the honour to be held for <hi rend="italic">the word of God</hi>, is not every one that translates the Scriptures
						out of the <hi rend="italic">Hebrew</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Greek </hi>tongue, to his Latine Auditors in Latine, to his French, in French, and to other Nations in
						their mother tongue; for this is not to interpret. For such is the nature of speech in generall, that although it deserve the chiefe place among those signes whereby we
						declare our conceptions to others, yet cannot it perform that office alone without the help of many circumstances; For the living voice hath its interpreters present,
						to wit, time, place, countenance, gesture, the Counsell of the Speaker, and himselfe unfolding his own meaning in other words as oft as need is. To recall these aids of
						interpretation, so much desired in the writings of old time, is neither the part of an ordinary wit, nor yet of the quaintest, without great learning, and very much
						skill in antiquity. It sufficeth not therefore for interpretation of Scriptures, that a man <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0370" n="315"/>understand the language wherein they speak. Neither is every one an
						authentique Interpreter of Scriptures, who writes Comments upon them: For men may erre, they may also either bend them to serve their own ambition, or even resisting,
						draw them into bondage by their forestallings; whence it will follow that an erroneous sentence must be held for <hi rend="italic">the word of God</hi>. But although
						this could not happen, yet as soon as these Commentators are departed, their Commentaries will need explications, and in processe of time, those explications,
						expositions; those expositions new Commentaries without any end: so as there cannot in any written Interpretation whatsoever be a Canon, or Rule of Christian doctrine,
						whereby the Controversies of Religion may be determined. It remains, that there must bee some Canonicall Interpreter whose legitimate Office it is to end Controversies
						begun, by explaining the word of God in the judgements themselves; and whose authority therefore must be no lesse obeyed, then theirs who first recommended the
						Scripture it selfe to us for a Canon of faith; and that one, and the same Person be <hi rend="italic">an Interpreter of Scripture</hi>, and a <hi rend="italic">supreme
							Judge</hi> of all manner of <hi rend="italic">doctrines</hi>. </p>
					<p> XIX. What concerns the word <hi rend="italic">Ecclesia</hi>, or Church: originally it signifies the same thing that <hi rend="italic">Concio</hi>, or a congregation
						does in Latin; even as <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastes</hi>, or Church man, the same that <hi rend="italic">concionator</hi>, or Preacher, that is to say, He who speaks
						to the Congregation. In which sense wee read in the Acts of the Apostles, of a <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0371" n="316"/>Church <hi rend="italic">confused</hi>, and of a <hi rend="italic">Lawfull Church</hi>,
						Acts 19. vers. 32, 39. that, taken for a Concourse of people meeting in way of tumult; this, for a convocated Assembly. But in holy writ by a <hi rend="italic">Church
							of Christians</hi>, is sometimes understood the Assembly, and sometimes the Christians themselves, although not actually assembled, if they be permitted to enter into
						the Congregation, and to communicate with them. For example. <hi rend="italic">Tell it to the Church</hi>, Mat. 18. vers. 17. is meant of a Church assembled; for
						otherwise it is impossible to <hi rend="italic">tell </hi>any thing to <hi rend="italic">the Church</hi>: But, <hi rend="italic">Hee laid waste the Church,</hi>
						<hi rend="italic">Acts </hi>8. vers. 3. is understood of a Church not assembled. Sometimes a <hi rend="italic">Church </hi>is taken for those who are baptized, or for
						the professors of the Christian faith, whether they be Christians inwardly, or feignedly, as when we reade of somewhat said or written to the Church, or said or
						decreed, or done by the <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>; sometimes for the <hi rend="italic">Elect </hi>onely, as when it is called holy, <hi rend="italic">and without
							blemish</hi>, Ephes. 5. vers. 27. But the <hi rend="italic">Elect</hi>, as they are militant, are not properly called a <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>; for they know
						not how to assemble, but they are a <hi rend="italic">future Church,</hi> namely in that day when sever'd from the reprobate, they shall bee triumphant. Againe a Church
						may bee sometimes taken (for all Christians collectively,) as when Christ is called the head of his <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>, and the head of his body the <hi
							rend="italic">Church</hi>, Eph. 5. vers. 23. Colos. 1. vers. 18. sometimes for its parts, as the Church of <hi rend="italic">Ephesus</hi>, <hi rend="italic">The
								Church which is in his house, the seven Churches,</hi> &amp; c. Lastly, a <hi rend="italic">Church </hi>as it is <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0372" n="317"/>taken for a Company actually assembled, according
						to the divers ends of their meeting, signifies sometimes those who are met together to deliberate, and judge, in which sense it is also called a Councell, &amp; a
						Synod; sometimes those who meet together in the house of prayer to worship God, in which signification it is taken in the 1 Cor. 14. vers. 4, 5. 23. 28. &amp;amp;c. </p>
					<p> XX. Now a <hi rend="italic">Church </hi>which hath <hi rend="italic">personall Rights,</hi> and proper <hi rend="italic">actions </hi>attributed to it, and of which
						that same must necessarily be understood, <hi rend="italic">Tell it to the church,</hi> and, <hi rend="italic">he that obeys not the church,</hi> and all such like
						formes of speech, is to be defin'd so, as by that word may be understood, A Multitude of men who have made a new Covenant with God in Christ, (that is to say, a
						multitude of them who have taken upon them the Sacrament of Baptisme) which multitude, may both lawfully be call'd together by some one into one place, and he so
						calling them, are bound to be present either in Person, or by others. For a multitude of men, if they cannot meet in assembly, when need requires, is not to be call'd
							<hi rend="italic">a Person</hi>; For a <hi rend="italic">Church </hi>can neither speak, nor discerne, nor heare, but as it is a congregation. Whatsoever is spoken by
						particular men, (to wit, as many opinions almost as heads) that's the speech of one man, not of the <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>; farthermore, if an assembly be made,
						and it be unlawfull, it shall be considered as null. Not any one of these therefore who are present in a tumult shall be tyed to the decree of the rest, but specially
						if he dissent; and therefore <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0373" n="318"/>neither can such a <hi rend="italic">Church </hi>make any decree; for then a multitude is sayd to decree somewhat, when every man is
						oblig'd by the decree of the major part. We must therefore grant to the definition of a <hi rend="italic">Church </hi>(to which we attribute <hi rend="italic">things
							belonging to a Person</hi>) not onely a possibility of assembling, but also of doing it lawfully. Besides, although there be some one who may lawfully call the rest
						together, yet if they who are called may lawfully not appeare (which may happen among men who are not subject one to another) that same <hi rend="italic">Church is not
							one Person.</hi> For by what Right they, who being call'd to a certaine time, and place, doe meet together, are <hi rend="italic">one Church</hi>; by the same, others
						flocking to another place appointed by them, are <hi rend="italic">another Church</hi>. And every number <hi rend="italic">of men of one opinion</hi> is a <hi
							rend="italic">Church</hi>, and by Consequence there will be as many <hi rend="italic">Churches </hi>as there are divers opinions, that is to say, the same <hi
							rend="italic">multitude </hi>of men will at once prove to be <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">many Churches</hi>. Wherefore a <hi rend="italic"
							>Church </hi>is not one, except there be a certaine, and known, that is to say, a lawfull power, by meanes whereof every man may be oblig'd to be present in the
						Congregation, either himselfe in person, or by Proxie. And that becomes <hi rend="italic">One</hi>, and is capable of <hi rend="italic">personall </hi>functions, by the
						union of a lawfull power of convocating Synods, and assemblies of Christians; not by uniformity of Doctrine: and otherwise, it is a multitude, and <hi rend="italic"
							>Persons </hi>in the plurall, howsoever agreeing in opinions. </p>
					<p> XXI. It followes what hath beene <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0374" n="319"/>already said by necessary connexion, that <hi rend="italic">a City of Christian men</hi>, and a <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>, is
						altogether the same thing, of the same men, term'd by two names, for two causes: For the <hi rend="italic">matter of a City</hi> &amp; a <hi rend="italic">Church
						</hi>is one, to wit the same Christian men. And the <hi rend="italic">forme </hi>which consists in a Lawfull power of assembling them is the same too; for 'tis manifest
						that every Subject is oblig'd to come thither, whither he is summon'd by his <hi rend="italic">City</hi>. Now that which is call'd a <hi rend="italic">City</hi>, as it
						is made up of <hi rend="italic">men</hi>, the same, as it consists of <hi rend="italic">Christians</hi>, is styled a <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>. </p>
					<p> XXII. This too is very cohaerent with the same points, <hi rend="italic">If there be many Christian Cities, they are not altogether personally one church</hi>. They
						may indeed by mutuall consent become one <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>, but no otherwise, then as they must also become one City; For they cannot assemble but at some
						certaine time, and to some place appointed. But Persons, places, and times, belong to civill Right; neither can any Subject or stranger lawfully set his foot on any
						place, but by the permission of the City, which is Lord of the place. But the things which cannot lawfully be done but by the permission of the City, those, if they be
						lawfully done, are done by the Cities authority. The <hi rend="italic">Universall church</hi> is indeed one <hi rend="italic">mysticall body</hi>, whereof CHRIST is the
						head, but in the same manner, that all men together acknowledging God for the Ruler of the world, are one Kingdome, and one City, which notwithstanding is neither <hi
							rend="italic">one Person</hi>, nor hath it one common action, or determination. Farthermore where it is <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0375" n="320"/>said that CHRIST <hi rend="italic">is the head of his body the
							Church</hi>, it manifestly appeares, that that was spoken by the Apostle of the Elect, who as long as they are in this world, are a <hi rend="italic">Church
						</hi>onely in <hi rend="italic">potentia</hi>, but shall not actually be so before they be separated from the reprobate, and gather'd together among themselves, in the
						day of Judgement. The Church of <hi rend="italic">Rome </hi>of old was very great, but she went not beyond the bounds of her Empire; and therefore neither was she <hi
							rend="italic">Universall</hi>, unlesse it were in that sense, wherein it was also said of the City of <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>, <foreign lang="lat">
							<hi rend="italic">Orbem jam totum victor Romanus habebat,</hi>
						</foreign> when as yet he had not the twentieth part of it. But after that the civill Empire was divided into parts, the single Cities thence arising were so many
						Churches; and that power which the Church of <hi rend="italic">Rome </hi>had over them, might perhaps wholy depend on the authority of those Churches, who having cast
						off the Emperours were yet content to admit the Doctours of <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>. </p>
					<p> XXIII. They may be called <hi rend="italic">Church-men</hi> who exercise a publique office in the Church. But of offices there was one a <hi rend="italic"
						>Ministery</hi>, another a <hi rend="italic">Maistery</hi>; The office of the <hi rend="italic">Ministers </hi>was to serve Tables, to take care of the temporall goods
						of the <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>, and to distribute (at that time when all propriety of riches being abolisht, they were fed in common) to each man his portion; The
							<hi rend="italic">Maisters </hi>according to their order, were called some <hi rend="italic">Apostles</hi>, some <hi rend="italic">Bishops</hi>, some <hi
								rend="italic">Presbyters</hi>, that is to say, <hi rend="italic">Elders</hi>; yet not so, as that by the name of <hi rend="italic">Presbyter, the <pb
									entity="DSSR_000002537_0376" n="321"/>age</hi>, but the
							<hi rend="italic">office </hi>might be distinguisht; For <hi rend="italic">Timothy </hi>was a <hi rend="italic">Presbyter </hi>although a young man; but because for
						the most part the <hi rend="italic">Elders </hi>were receiv'd into the <hi rend="italic">Maistership</hi>, the word, denoting age, was us'd to signifie the office. The
						same <hi rend="italic">Maisters</hi>, according to the diversity of their employments were called some of them <hi rend="italic">Apostles</hi>, some <hi rend="italic"
							>Prophets</hi>, some <hi rend="italic">Evangelists</hi>, some <hi rend="italic">Pastors </hi>or <hi rend="italic">Teachers</hi>. And the <hi rend="italic"
							>Apostolicall</hi> worke indeed was universall; the <hi rend="italic">Propheticall </hi>to declare their owne revelations in the <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>; the
							<hi rend="italic">Evangelicall </hi>to preach, or to be publishers of the <hi rend="italic">Gospell </hi>among the infidels; that of the <hi rend="italic">Pastors
						</hi>to teach, confirme, and rule the minds of those who already beleev'd. </p>
					<p> XXIV. In the <hi rend="italic">Election of Church-men</hi> two things are to be considered, the <hi rend="italic">Election </hi>of the Persons, and their
						consecration, or institution, which also is called ordination. The first twelve <hi rend="italic">Apostles </hi>CHRIST himselfe both <hi rend="italic">elected</hi>, and
							<hi rend="italic">ordain'd</hi>. After CHRISTS ascension <hi rend="italic">Matthias </hi>was elected in the roome of <hi rend="italic">Judas </hi>the Traitour, the
						Church (which at that time consisted of a Congregation of about one hundred and twenty men) <hi rend="italic">choosing two men</hi>: And <hi rend="italic">they
							appointed two, Joseph</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Matthias</hi>; but God himselfe by lot approving of <hi rend="italic">Mathias</hi>. And Saint <hi rend="italic">Paul
						</hi>calls these <hi rend="italic">twelve the first, and great Apostles,</hi> also the Apostles <hi rend="italic">of the Circumcision</hi>. Afterward were added two
						other Apostles, <hi rend="italic">Paul</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Barnabas</hi>; ordain'd indeed by the Doctours, and Prophets of the Church of <hi rend="italic"
							>Antioch</hi>, (which was <hi rend="italic">a particular</hi> Church) by the imposition <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0377" n="322"/>of hands, but elected by the command of the Holy Ghost. That they were both
							<hi rend="italic">Apostles </hi>is manifest in the 13. of the Acts <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. 2, 3. That they receiv'd their Apostleship from hence, namely because
						they were separated by command of the spirit for the work of God, from the rest of the Prophets, and Doctours of the Church of <hi rend="italic">Antioch</hi>, Saint
						Paul himselfe shewes, who calls himselfe for distinctions sake <hi rend="italic">an Apostle separated unto the Gospell of God</hi>, Rom. 1. ver. 1. But if it be
						demanded further; <hi rend="italic">by what authority</hi> it came to passe that that was receiv'd for the command of the Holy Ghost, which those Prophets and Doctours
						did say proceeded from him, it must necessarily be answer'd; <hi rend="italic">by the Authority of the church of</hi> Antioch. For the Prophets &amp; Doctours must
						be examined by the Church before they be admitted; For Saint <hi rend="italic">John </hi>saith, <hi rend="italic">Beleeve not every Spirit, but try the Spirits, whether
							they are of God, because many false Prophets are gone out into the world</hi>; but by what Church, but that to which that Epistle was written? In like manner Saint
						Paul reprooves the Churches of <hi rend="italic">Galatia</hi>, because they Judaized, <hi rend="italic">Gal</hi>. 2. <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. 14. although they seemed
						to doe so by the Authority of <hi rend="italic">Peter</hi>; for when he had told them that he had, reprehended <hi rend="italic">Peter </hi>himselfe with these words,
							<hi rend="italic">If thou being a Iew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as doe the Iewes, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as doe the Iewes</hi>?
						Not long after he questions them, saying, <hi rend="italic">This onely would I learne of you: Received ye the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of
							faith? Gal</hi>. 3. <hi rend="italic">ver</hi>. 2. Where it is evident, that it <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0378" n="323"/>was <hi rend="italic">Judaisme </hi>which he reprehended the <hi rend="italic"
							>Galathians </hi>for, notwithstanding that the Apostle <hi rend="italic">Peter </hi>compelled them to <hi rend="italic">Judaize</hi>. Seeing therefore it belonged to
						the <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>, and not to <hi rend="italic">Peter</hi>, and therefore also not to any man, to determine what Doctors they should follow, it also
						pertained to the authority of <hi rend="italic">the Church</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Antioch </hi>to elect their Prophets and Doctors. Now because the Holy Ghost
						separated to himself the Apostles <hi rend="italic">Paul &amp; Barnabas</hi>, by the imposition of hands from Doctors thus elected; its manifest, <hi rend="italic"
							>that imposition of hands, &amp; consecration,</hi> of the prime Doctors in each <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>, belongs to the Doctors of the same <hi
							rend="italic">Church</hi>. But <hi rend="italic">Bishops</hi>, who were also called <hi rend="italic">Presbyters</hi>, although all <hi rend="italic">Presbyters
						</hi>were not Bishops, were ordain'd somtimes by <hi rend="italic">Apostles </hi>(for <hi rend="italic">Paul </hi>&amp; <hi rend="italic">Barnabas </hi>when they
						had taught in<hi rend="italic"> Derbe, Lystra</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Iconium</hi>, ordained <hi rend="italic">Elders </hi>in every Church, <hi rend="italic">Acts
						</hi>14. v. 23.) sometimes by other Bishops, for <hi rend="italic">Titus</hi> was by <hi rend="italic">Paul </hi>left in <hi rend="italic">Crete</hi>, that he should
						ordain <hi rend="italic">Elders </hi>in every City, <hi rend="italic">Tit</hi>. 1. v. 5. And <hi rend="italic">Timothy </hi>was advised <hi rend="italic">not to neglect
							the gift that was in him, which was given him by Prophesy with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery</hi>, 1. Tim. 4. v. 14. And he had rules given him
						concerning the Election of <hi rend="italic">Presbyters</hi>. But that cannot be understood otherwise, then of the ordination of those who were elected by the Church;
						for no man could constitute a Doctor in the Church, but by the Churches permission. For the duty of the <hi rend="italic">Apostles </hi>themselves was not to command,
						but to teach; and although they who were recommended by the <hi rend="italic">Apostles</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Presbyters</hi>, were not rejected, for the esteem
						that was had of <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0379" n="324"/>the recommenders, yet seeing they could not be elected without <hi rend="italic">the will of the Church,</hi> they were also suppos'd elected by <hi
							rend="italic">the authority of the Church</hi>. In like manner Ministers, who are called <hi rend="italic">Deacons</hi>, were ordained by the <hi rend="italic"
							>Apostles</hi>; yet <hi rend="italic">elected </hi>by the Church. For when the seven <hi rend="italic">Deacons </hi>were to bee elected, and ordained, the <hi
							rend="italic">Apostles </hi>elected them not, but <hi rend="italic">look yee out</hi>, (say they) <hi rend="italic">among you Brethren seven men of honest
						report,</hi> &amp;amp;c. And they chose <hi rend="italic">Stephen</hi>, &amp;amp;c. And they <hi rend="italic">set them before the Apostles,</hi> Acts 6. vers.
						3. 6. It is apparent therefore by the custome of the Primitive <hi rend="italic">Church </hi>under the <hi rend="italic">Apostles</hi>, that the <hi rend="italic"
							>ordination</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">consecration </hi>of all Church-men, which is done by <hi rend="italic">prayer</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">imposition of
						hands</hi>, belonged to the <hi rend="italic">Apostles</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Doctors</hi>; but the <hi rend="italic">Election </hi>of those who were to be
						consecrated, <hi rend="italic">to the Church</hi>. </p>
					<p> XXV. Concerning the power of <hi rend="italic">binding</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">loosing</hi>, that is to say of <hi rend="italic">remitting</hi>, and <hi
							rend="italic">retaining </hi>of sinnes, there is no doubt, but it was given by <hi rend="italic">Christ </hi>to the <hi rend="italic">Pastors </hi>then yet for to
						come, in the same manner as it was to the present <hi rend="italic">Apostles</hi>. Now the <hi rend="italic">Apostles </hi>had all the power <hi rend="italic">of
							remitting of sins</hi> given them, which Christ himselfe had; <hi rend="italic">As the Father hath sent me</hi> (sayes Christ) <hi rend="italic">so send I you,</hi>
						John 20. vers. 21. and he addes, <hi rend="italic">Whose soever sins yee remit, they are remitted, and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained</hi>. vers. 23.
						But what <hi rend="italic">binding </hi>and <hi rend="italic">loosing</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">remitting </hi>and <hi rend="italic">retaining of sinnes</hi>, is,
						admits of some scruple. For first, to <hi rend="italic">retain </hi>his <hi rend="italic">sinnes </hi>who being baptized into remission of sins, is truly penitent,
						seems to be against the very Covenant it selfe of the new <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0380" n="325"/>Testament, and therefore could not be done by Christ himselfe, much lesse by his Pastors. And to <hi
							rend="italic">remit </hi>the impenitent, seems to be against the will of God the Father, from whom Christ was sent to convert the world, and to reduce men unto
						obedience. Furthermore, if each Pastor had an authority granted him to <hi rend="italic">remit </hi>and <hi rend="italic">retain </hi>sinnes in this manner, all awe of
							<hi rend="italic">Princes</hi>, and civill Magistrates, together with all kind of civill Government would be utterly destroyed. For Christ hath said it, nay even
						nature it selfe dictates, that <hi rend="italic">we should not feare them who slay the body, but cannot kill the soule; but rather feare him who can cast both soule and
							body into hell</hi>, Mat. 10. vers. 28. Neither is any man so <hi rend="italic">mad </hi>as not to choose to yeeld obedience rather to them who can <hi rend="italic"
							>remit</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">retain their sinnes,</hi> then to the powerfullest Kings. Nor yet on the other side, it is to be imagined, that <hi rend="italic"
							>remission of sinnes</hi> is nothing else but an exemption from Ecclesiasticall punishments; for what evill hath excommunication in it, beside the eternall pains
						which are consequent to it? or what benefit is it to be received into the Church if there were salvation out of it? We must therefore hold, <hi rend="italic">That
							Pastors have Power, truly, and absolutely to forgive sinnes, but, to the penitent; and to retain them, but, of the impenitent.</hi> But while men think that to
						Repent, is nothing else but that every one condemn his Actions, and change those Counsels which to himselfe seem sinfull, and blameable, there is an opinion risen, that
						there may be repentance before any Confession of sinnes to men, and that repentance is not an <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0381" n="326"/>effect, but a cause of Confession; and thence, the difficulty of those who
						say that the sins of the penitent are already forgiven in Baptisme, and theirs who repent not, cannot be forgiven at al, is against Scripture, and contrary to the words
						of <hi rend="italic">Christ, Whose soever sins ye remit, &amp;amp;c</hi>. We must therefore to resolve this difficulty know in the first place, that a true
						acknowledgement of sin is Repentance; for he that knows he hath sinned, knows he hath erred, but to will an errour is impossible; therefore he that knowes he hath
						sinned, wishes he had not done it, which is to repent. Farther, where it may be doubtfull, whether that which is done be a sin or not, we must consider, that repentance
						doth not precede confession of sins, but is subsequent to it: for there is no repentance but of sinnes acknowledged. The penitent therefore must both acknowledge the
						fact, and know it to be a sinne, that is to say, against the Law. If a man therefore think, that what he hath done, is not against the Law; its impossible he should
						repent of it. Before repentance therefore, its necessary there be an application of the facts unto the Law. But its in vain to apply the facts unto the Law without an
						Interpreter. for not the words of the Law, but the sentence of the Law-giver is the rule of mens actions; but surely either one man, or some men are the Interpreters of
						the Law, for every man is not judge of his own fact whether it be a sin or not; wherefore the fact of which we doubt whether it be a sinne or not, must be unfolded
						before some man or men, and the doing of this is confession. Now when the Interpreter of the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0382" n="327"/>Law hath judged the fact to bee a sinne, if the sinner submit to his
						judgement, and resolve with himselfe not to do so any more, tis repentance; and thus, either it is not true repentance, or else it is not antecedent, but subsequent to
						confession. These things being thus explained, it is not hard to understand what kinde of power that of <hi rend="italic">binding </hi>and <hi rend="italic">loosing
						</hi>is. For seeing in remission of sinnes there are two things considerable, one the <hi rend="italic">Judgement </hi>or <hi rend="italic">Condemnation </hi>whereby
						the fact is judged to be a sinne; the other, (when the Party condemned does acquiesce, and obey the sentence, that is to say, Repents) <hi rend="italic">the remission
							of the sinne, or,</hi> (if he repent not) <hi rend="italic">the Retention</hi>: The first of these, that is to say, the Judging whether it be a sinne or not, belongs
							<hi rend="italic">to the Interpreter of the Law</hi>, that is, the <hi rend="italic">Soveraign Judge</hi>; the second, namely Remission, or retention of the sinne,
							<hi rend="italic">to the Pastor</hi>, and it is that concerning which the power <hi rend="italic">of binding</hi> and <hi rend="italic">loosing </hi>is conversant.
						And that this was the true meaning of our Saviour Christ in the institution of the same power, is apparent in the 18 of <hi rend="italic">Mat</hi>. vers. 15, 16, 17,
						18. thus, He there speaking to his Disciples, sayes, <hi rend="italic">If thy Brother sinne against thee, goe, and tell him his fault betweene thee and him alone,</hi>
						(where we must observe by the way, that if thy Brother sinne against thee, is the same with, if he doe thee injury; and therefore Christ spake of those matters which
						belonged to the <hi rend="italic">civill Tribunall</hi>) he addes, <hi rend="italic">if he heare thee not</hi> (that is to say, if he deny that he hath done it, or if
						having confest the fact, he denies it to be unjustly done) <hi rend="italic">take with <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0383" n="328"/>thee yet one or two, and if he refuse to heare them, tell it the Church</hi>. But
						why to the <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>, except that she might judge whether it were a sinne or not? But if <hi rend="italic">he refuses to hear the Church</hi>, that
						is, if he doe not submit to the Churches sentence, but shall maintain that to be no sin, which She Judges to be a sinne, that is to say, if he repent not (for certain
						it is that no man repents himselfe of that action which She conceives not to be a sinne) he saith not, <hi rend="italic">Tell it to the Apostles</hi>, that we might
						know that the definitive sentence in the question, whether it were a sin or not, was not left unto them, but to the Church; <hi rend="italic">but let him be unto
						thee</hi> (sayes he) <hi rend="italic">as an Heathen, or Publican,</hi> that is, as one out of the <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>, as one that is not baptized, that is
						to say, as one whose <hi rend="italic">sinnes are retained</hi>. For all Christians were baptized into remission of sinnes. But because it might have been demanded who
						it was that had so great a power, as that of withholding the benefit of Baptisme from the impenitent, <hi rend="italic">Christ </hi>shewes that the same Persons to whom
						he had given authority to baptize the penitent into the remission of sinns, and to make them of heathen men, Christians, had also authority to retain their sins who by
						the <hi rend="italic">Church should</hi> be adjudged to be impenitent, and to make them of Christian men Heathens; and therefore presently subjoynes, <hi rend="italic"
							>Verily I say unto you, Whose soever sinnes yee shall binde upon Earth, they shall bee bound also in Heaven, and whose soever sins yee shall loose upon Earth, they
							shall be loosed also in Heaven</hi>. Whence we may understand, that the power of <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0384" n="329"/>binding, and loosing, or of remitting, and retaining of sinnes, which is called in
						another place, the power of the keyes, is not different from the power given in another place in these words, <hi rend="italic">Goe, and teach all Nations, Baptizing
							them in the Name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost</hi>, Mat. 28. ver. 19. And even as the Pastours cannot refuse to Baptize him whom the Church
						judges worthy, so neither can they retaine his sinnes whom the Church holds fitting to be absolv'd, nor yet remit his sinnes whom the Church pronounceth disobedient.
						And it is the Churches part to judge of the sinne, the Pastours, to cast out, or to receive into the Church those that are judg'd. Thus Saint <hi rend="italic">Paul
						</hi>to the Church of <hi rend="italic">Corinth</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Do not ye judge</hi>, saith he, <hi rend="italic">of those that are within?</hi> Yet he himself
						pronounc't the sentence of Excommunication against the incestuous Person, <hi rend="italic">I indeed</hi> (saith he) <hi rend="italic">as absent in body, but present in
							Spirit, &amp;amp;c.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> XXVI. The act of retaining sinnes is that which is called by the Church <hi rend="italic">Excommunication</hi>, and by Saint Paul, <hi rend="italic">delivering over
							to Satan</hi>. The word <hi rend="italic">Excommunication</hi>, sounding the same with <foreign lang="gre">
							<hi rend="italic"
								>&#x1F00;&pgr;&ogr;&sgr;&ugr;&ngr;&#x1F71;&#x03B3;&#x03C9;&ggr;&ogr;&ngr;
								&pgr;&ogr;&igr;&egr;&#x1FD6;&ngr;</hi>
						</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">casting out of the Synagogue</hi>, seems to be borrowed from the Mosaicall Law, wherein they who were by the Priest adjudged leprous, were
						commanded to be kept apart out of the Camp, untill by the judgement of the Priest they were againe pronounc't cleane, and by certaine rights (among which the washing of
						the body was one) were purified, <hi rend="italic">Levit</hi>. 13. <hi rend="italic">ver</hi>. 46. From hence in processe of time it became a <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0385"
							n="330"/>custome of the <hi
							rend="italic">Jewes</hi>, not to receive those who passed from <hi rend="italic">Gentilisme </hi>to <hi rend="italic">Judaisme</hi>, (supposing them to be uncleane)
						unlesse they were first <hi rend="italic">washed</hi>; and those who dissented from the Doctrine of the Synagogue, they cast out of the Synagogue. By resemblance of
						this custome, those that came to Christianity, (whether they were <hi rend="italic">Jewes</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Gentiles</hi>) were not receiv'd into the Church
						without Baptisme; and those that dissented from the Church were depriv'd of the Churches Communion. Now, they were therefore said <hi rend="italic">to be deliver'd over
							to Satan</hi>, because all that was out of the Church, was comprehended within his Kingdome. The end of this kind of Discipline was, that being destitute for a time
						of the grace and spirituall priviledges of the Church, they might be humbled to salvation. But the effect in regard to secular matters, that <hi rend="italic">being
							excommunicated</hi>, they should not onely be prohibited all Congregations, or Churches, and the participation of the mysteries, but as being contagious they should
						be avoided by all other Christians, even more then Heathen: for the Apostle allowed <hi rend="italic">to accompany with Heathen, but with these not so much as to eate,
						</hi>1 Cor. 5. <hi rend="italic">ver</hi>. 10, </p>
					<p> II. Seeing then the effect of <hi rend="italic">Excommunication </hi>is such, it is manifest in the first place, that <hi rend="italic">a Christian city cannot be
							excommunicated</hi>. For a Christian City is a Christian Church, as hath been declar'd above in the 21. Art. and of the same extension. But a <hi rend="italic">Church
							</hi>cannot be excommunicated; For either she must excommunicate her selfe, which is impossible; or she must be <hi rend="italic">excommunicated by <pb
								entity="DSSR_000002537_0386" n="331"/>some other
						Church</hi>, and this, either <hi rend="italic">universall</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">particular</hi>. But seeing <hi rend="italic">an Universall Church</hi> is no <hi
							rend="italic">Person</hi>, (as hath been prov'd in the 22. Artic.) and therefore neither acts, nor does any thing, it cannot <hi rend="italic">excommunicate </hi>any
						man. And <hi rend="italic">a particular church</hi> by <hi rend="italic">excommunicating another Church</hi> doth nothing; for where there is not one <hi rend="italic"
							>common </hi>Congregation, there cannot be any <hi rend="italic">Excommunication</hi>. Neither if some one Church (suppose that of <hi rend="italic">Jerusalem</hi>)
						should have <hi rend="italic">excommunicated </hi>an other (suppose that of <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>) would it any more have <hi rend="italic">excommunicated
						</hi>this, then her selfe: for he that deprives another of his Communion, deprives himselfe also of the Communion of that other. Secondly, <hi rend="italic">No man can
							excommunicate the subjects of any absolute government all at once, or forbid them the use of their Temples, or their publique worship of God</hi>. For they cannot <hi
							rend="italic">be excommunicated</hi> by a <hi rend="italic">Church</hi> which themselves doe constitute; for if they could, there would not onely not remain a <hi
							rend="italic">Church</hi>, but not so much as a <hi rend="italic">common-weale</hi>, and they would be dissolved of themselves; and this were not <hi rend="italic">to
							be excommunicated</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">prohibited</hi>. But if they be <hi rend="italic">excommunicated</hi> by some <hi rend="italic">other Church</hi>, that
							<hi rend="italic">church </hi>is to esteem them as Heathen. But no <hi rend="italic">christian Church</hi> by the doctrine of <hi rend="italic">Christ</hi>, can
						forbid the Heathen to gather together, and <hi rend="italic">Communicate </hi>among themselves, as it shall seem good to their Cities, especially if they meet to
						worship <hi rend="italic">Christ</hi>, although it be done in a singular custome, and manner: therefore also not the <hi rend="italic">excommunicated</hi>, who are to
						be dealt with as Heathen. Thirdly, <hi rend="italic">a Prince who hath the Soveraign Power, cannot <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0387" n="332"/>be excommunicated</hi>. For by the doctrine of <hi rend="italic"
							>Christ</hi>, neither one, nor many subjects together can interdict their Prince any publique, or private places, or deny him entrance into any Assembly whatsoever,
						or prohibit him the doing of what hee will within his own jurisdiction. For it is Treason among all Cities, for any one, or many subjects joyntly to arrogate to
						themselves any authority over the whole City; but they who arrogate to themselves an authority over him who hath the supreme power of the City, doe arrogate the same
						authority over the City it selfe. Besides, a Soveraign Prince, if he be a Christian, hath this farther advantage, that the City whose Will is contained in His, is that
						very thing which we call a <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">Church</hi> therefore excommunicates no man, but whom it <hi rend="italic"
							>excommunicates </hi>by the authority of the Prince: but the Prince <hi rend="italic">excommunicates </hi>not himselfe, his subjects therefore cannot doe it. It may
						be indeed that an Assembly of rebellious Citizens or Traytors, may pronounce the sentence of <hi rend="italic">excommunication </hi>against their Prince, but not <hi
							rend="italic">by Right</hi>. Much lesse can one Prince be <hi rend="italic">excommunicated </hi>by another, for this would prove not an <hi rend="italic"
							>excommunication</hi>, but a provocation to Warre by the way of affront. For since that is not one <hi rend="italic">church </hi>which is made up of Citizens
						belonging to two absolute Cities, for want of power of lawfully assembling them, (as hath been declar'd before in the 22. Art.) they who are of one Church are not bound
						to obey an other, and therefore cannot be <hi rend="italic">excommunicated </hi>for their disobedience. Now, what <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0388" n="333"/>some may say, that Princes, being they are members of
						the <hi rend="italic">Universall church</hi>, may also by the authority of <hi rend="italic">the Universall church</hi> be <hi rend="italic">excommunicated</hi>,
						signifies nothing: because <hi rend="italic">the Universall church</hi> (as hath beene shewed in the 22. Art.) is not <hi rend="italic">one Person</hi>, of whom it may
						be said that <hi rend="italic">shee acted, decreed, determin'd, excommunicated, absolv'd,</hi> and the like personall attributes; neither hath she any Governour upon
						Earth at whose command she may assemble, and deliberate: For to be guide of <hi rend="italic">the Universall church</hi>, and to have the power of assembling her, is
						the same thing as to be Governour, and Lord over all the Christians in the world, which is granted to none, but God onely. </p>
					<p> XXVII. It hath beene shewed above in the 18. Art. that the authority of <hi rend="italic">interpreting the Holy Scriptures</hi> consisted not in this, that the
						interpreter might without punishment, expound, and explicate his sentence &amp; opinion taken thence, unto others, either by writing, or by his owne voice; but,
						that others have not a Right to doe, or teach ought contrary to his sentence; insomuch as <hi rend="italic">the interpretation</hi> we speak of is the same with <hi
							rend="italic">the power</hi> of defining in all manner of controversies to be determined by sacred Scriptures. Now we must shew that that power belongs to each
						Church, and depends on his, or their authority who have the Supreme command, provided that they be Christians. For if it depend not on the civill authority, it must
						either depend on the opinion of each private Subject, or some forraigne authority. But among other reasons, the inconveniencies that must <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0389"
							n="334"/>follow private opinions cannot
						suffer its dependance on them; of which this is the chiefe, that not onely all civill obedience would be taken away (contrary to Christ his praecept) but all humane
						society and peace would be dissolved (contrary to the Lawes of nature;) for seeing every man is his owne interpreter of Scripture, that is to say, since every man makes
						himselfe judge of what is pleasing and displeasing unto God, they cannot obey their Princes before that they have judg'd whether their commands be conformable to the
						Word of God, or not. And thus either they obey not, or they obey for their owne opinions sake, that is to say, they obey themselves, not their Soveraigne; civill
						obedience therefore is lost. Againe, when every man followes his owne opinion, it's necessary that the controversies which rise among them will become innumerable, and
						indeterminable; whence there will breed among men (who by their own naturall inclinations doe account all dissention an affront) first hatred, then brawles and warres,
						and thus all manner of peace and society would vanish. We have farthermore for an example, that which God under the old Law required to be observed concerning the book
						of the Law, namely, that it should be transcrib'd, and publiquely us'd, and he would have it to be the Canon of Divine doctrine: but the controversies about it not to
						be determined by private Persons, but onely by the Priests. Lastly, it is our Saviours Precept, that if there be any matter of offence between private Persons, they
						should <hi rend="italic">hear the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0390" n="335"/>Church</hi>. Wherefore it is the <hi rend="italic">Churches </hi>duty to define controversies; it therefore belongs not to private
						men, but to the <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>, to interpret Scriptures. But that we may know that the authority of <hi rend="italic">interpreting Gods Word</hi>, that
						is to say, of determining all questions concerning God, and Religion, belongs not to any forraign Person whatsoever, we must consider first what esteem such a power
						carries in the mindes of the subjects, and their civill actions. For no man can be ignorant that the voluntary actions of men by a naturall necessity, doe follow those
						opinions which they have concerning good, and evill, Reward, and Punishment; whence it happens that necessarily they would chuse rather to obey those by whose judgement
						they beleeve that they shall be eternally happy, or miserable. Now, by whose judgement it is appointed what Doctrines are necessary to salvation, by their judgement doe
						men expect their eternall blisse, or perdition; they will therefore yeeld them obedience in all things. Which being thus, most manifest it is, that those subjects who
						believe themselves bound to acquiesce to a forraign authority in those Doctrines which are necessary to salvation, doe not <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> constitute a
						City, but are the subjects of that forraign power. Nor therefore although some Soveraign Prince should by writing grant such an authority to any other, yet so, as he
						would be understood to have retained the civill power in his own hands, shall such a Writing be valid, or transferre ought necessary for the retaining, or good
						administration of his command; for by the <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0391" n="336"/>2. Chap. 4. artic. no man is said <hi rend="italic">to transferre his Right, unlesse he give some proper sign, declaring his
							Will to transferre it</hi>; but he who hath openly declared his will to keep his Soveraignty, cannot have given a sufficient sign of transferring the means necessary
						for the keeping it. This kinde of Writing therefore will not be a sign of Will, but of Ignorance in the contractors. We must consider next how absurd it is for a City,
						or Soveraign, to commit the ruling of his Subjects consciences to an enemy. For they are, as hath been shewed above in the 5. Chap. 6. artic. in an hostile state,
						whosoever have not joyn'd themselves into the unity of one Person. Nor contradicts it this truth that they doe not alwayes fight: (for truces are made between enemies)
						it is sufficient for an hostile minde, that there is suspition, that the Frontiers of Cities, Kingdomes, Empires, strengthned with Garisons, doe with a fighting posture
						and countenance, though they strike not, yet as enemies mutually behold each other. Lastly, how unequall is it to demand that, which by the very reason of your demand,
						you confesse belongs to anothers Right? I am the Interpreter of Scriptures to you who are the Subject of anothers Realme: Why? By what Covenants past between you and
						me? By Divine authority. Whence knowne? Out of holy Scripture. Behold the Book, read it. In vain, unlesse I may also interpret the same for my self; That interpretation
						therefore doth by Right belong to me, and the rest of my private fellow-subjects; which we both deny. It remains therefore that in <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0392" n="337"/>all <hi rend="italic">christian
							Churches</hi>, that is to say, in all christian Cities, the <hi rend="italic">interpretation of sacred</hi> Scripture depend on, and derive from the authority of that
						man, or Councell, which hath the Soveraign power of the City. </p>
					<p> XXVIII. Now because there are two kindes of controversies, the one about <hi rend="italic">spirituall matters</hi>, that is to say, questions of faith, the truth
						whereof cannot be searcht into by naturall reason; such are the questions concerning <hi rend="italic">the nature</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">office of Christ, of
							rewards and punishments to come, of the Sacraments, of outward worship,</hi> and the like: the other, about questions of humane science, whose truth is sought out by
						naturall reason, and Syllogismes, drawne from the Covenants of men, and definitions (that is to say, significations received by use, and common consent of words) such
						as are all questions of Right, and Philosophy. For example, when in matter of Right its questioned whether there be <hi rend="italic">a Promise</hi>, and <hi
							rend="italic">Covenant</hi>, or not? that is nothing else, but to demand, whether such words spoken in such a manner be by common use, and consent of the Subjects,
							<hi rend="italic">a Promise or Covenant</hi>; which if they be so called, then it is true that a Contract is made, if not, then it is false: that truth therefore
						depends on the compacts, and consents of men. In like manner when it is demanded in Philosophy whether the same thing may entirely be in divers places at once; the
						determination of the question depends on the knowledge of the common consent of men about the signification of the word <hi rend="italic">entire</hi>: for if men when
						they say a thing is entirely <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0393" n="338"/>somewhere doe signifie by common consent that they understand nothing of the same to be elsewhere, it is false that the same thing is in
						divers places at once: that truth therefore depends on the consents of men, and by the same reason in all other questions concerning <hi rend="italic">Right, and
							Philosophy</hi>. And they who doe judge that any thing can be determin'd, (contrary to this common consent of men concerning the appellations of things) out of
						obscure places of Scripture, doe also judge that the use of speech, and at once all humane society, is to be taken away; for he who hath sold an whole field, will say,
						he meant one whole ridge, and will retaine the rest as unsold; nay, they take away reason it selfe, which is nothing else but a searching out of the truth made by such
						consent. These kinde of questions therefore need not be determin'd by the City by way of interpretation of Scriptures; for they belong not to Gods <hi rend="italic"
							>Word</hi>, in that sense wherein <hi rend="italic">the Word of God</hi> is taken for the <hi rend="italic">Word concerning God</hi>, that is to say, for the <hi
							rend="italic">Doctrine of the Gospell</hi>; neither is he who hath <hi rend="italic">the Soveraigne Power in the Church,</hi> oblig'd to employ any <hi rend="italic"
							>Ecclesiastical Doctours</hi> for the judging of any such kind of matters as these. But for the deciding of questions of Faith, that is to say, <hi rend="italic"
							>concerning God,</hi> which transcend humane capacity, we stand in need of a divine blessing (that we may not be deceiv'd at least in necessary points) to be deriv'd
						from CHRIST himselfe by the imposition of hands. For, seeing to the end we may attaine to aeternal Salvation, we are oblig'd to a supernatural Doctrine, &amp; <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0394" n="339"/>which
						therefore it is impossible for us to understand; to be left so destitute, as that we can be deceiv'd in necessary points, is repugnant to aequity. This infallibility
						our Saviour <hi rend="italic">Christ </hi>promis'd (in those things which are necessary to Salvation) to his <hi rend="italic">Apostles </hi>untill the day of
						judgement; that is to say, <hi rend="italic">to the Apostles, and Pastors</hi> succeeding the <hi rend="italic">Apostles </hi>who were to be consecrated <hi
							rend="italic">by the imposition of hands</hi>. He therefore who hath the Soveraigne power in the City, is oblig'd as a Christian, where there is any question
						concerning <hi rend="italic">the Mysteries of Faith</hi>, to interpret the Holy Scriptures by <hi rend="italic">Clergy-men</hi> lawfully ordain'd. And thus in Christian
						Cities the judgement both of <hi rend="italic">spirituall </hi>and <hi rend="italic">temporall matters </hi>belongs unto the civill authority. And that man, or councell
						who hath the Supreme power, is head both of <hi rend="italic">the City</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">of the Church</hi>; for a <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>, and <hi
							rend="italic">a Christian City</hi> is but one thing.</p>

					<lb/>
					<p> I. It was ever granted that all authority <hi rend="italic">in secular matters</hi> deriv'd from him who had the Soveraigne power, whether he were one Man, or an
						Assembly of Men. That the same in spirituall matters depended on the authority of the <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>, is manifest by the next foregoing proofs; and
						besides this, that all Christian Cities are Churches endued with this kind of authority From whence a man though but dull of apprehension may collect, that in <hi
							rend="italic">a Christian City</hi>, (that is to say, in a City whose Soveraignty belongs to a <hi rend="italic">Christian Prince</hi>, or Councell) <hi rend="italic"
							>all power, as well spiritual, as secular, is united under Christ</hi>; and therefore it is to be obey'd in all things. But on the other side, <hi rend="italic"
							>because we must rather obey God then Men</hi>, there is a difficulty risen, how obedience may safely be yeelded to them, if at any time somewhat should be commanded
						by them to be done which CHRIST hath prohibited. The reason of this difficulty is, that seeing God no longer speakes to us by CHRIST, and his <hi rend="italic">Prophets
						</hi>in open voice, but by the holy Scriptures, which by divers men are diversly understood, they know indeed what Princes, and a congregated Church doe command; but
						whether that which they doe command be contrary to the word of God, or not, this they know not, but with a wavering obedience between the punishments of temporall, and
						spirituall death, as it were sailing betweene <hi rend="italic">Scilla</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Carybdis</hi>, they often run themselves upon both. But they who rightly distinguish betweene
						the things necessary to Salvation, and those which are not necessary, can have none of this kind of <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0397" n="342"/>doubt. For if the command of the Prince, or City be such, that he
						can obey it without hazard of his aeternall Salvation, it is unjust not to obey them, and the <hi rend="italic">Apostles </hi>praecepts take place: <hi rend="italic"
							>Servants in all things obey your Wasters according to the flesh. Children obey your Parents in all things</hi>. Col. 3. v. 20, 22. And the command of CHRIST, <hi
							rend="italic">The </hi>Scribes <hi rend="italic">and </hi>Pharisees <hi rend="italic">sit in</hi> Moyses <hi rend="italic">chair, all things therefore whatsoever they
							command you, that observe, and doe.</hi> Mat. 23. v. 2. On the contrary, if they command us to doe those things which are punisht with aeternall death, it were
						madnesse not rather to chuse to dye a naturall death, then by obeying, to dye eternally; and then comes in that which CHRIST sayes, <hi rend="italic">Feare not them who
							kill the body, but cannot kill the Soule.</hi> Mat. 10. v. 28. We must see therefore what all those things are, which are necessary to Salvation. </p>
					<p> II. Now all things <hi rend="italic">necessary </hi>to Salvation are comprehended in two vertues, <hi rend="italic">Faith</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Obedience</hi>.
						The latter of these if it could be perfect would alone suffice to preserve us from damnation; but because we have all of us beene long since guilty of disobedience
						against God in <hi rend="italic">Adam</hi>, and besides we our selves have since actually sinned, <hi rend="italic">Obedience </hi>is not sufficient without <hi
							rend="italic">remission of sinnes</hi>. But this, together with our entrance into the Kingdome of Heaven is the reward of <hi rend="italic">Faith</hi>. Nothing else
						is requisite to Salvation; for the Kingdome of Heaven is shut to none but sinners, that is to say, those who have not perform'd due <hi rend="italic">Obedience </hi>to
						the Lawes; and not to those neither, if they beleeve the necessary articles <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0398" n="343"/>of the Christian Faith. Now, if we shall know in what points Obedience doth consist, and
						which are <hi rend="italic">the necessary articles of the Christian Faith</hi>, it will at once be manifest what we must doe, and what abstaine from, at the commands of
						Cities, and of Princes. </p>
					<p> III. But by <hi rend="italic">Obedience </hi>in this place is signified not <hi rend="italic">the fact</hi>, but the <hi rend="italic">Will </hi>and <hi rend="italic"
							>desire </hi>wherewith we purpose, and endeavour as much as we can to obey for the future: in which sense the word <hi rend="italic">Obedience </hi>is aequivalent to
							<hi rend="italic">Repentance</hi>. For the vertue of repentance consists not in the sorrow which accompanies the remembrance of sinne; but in our conversion to the
						way, and full purpose to sinne no more, without which that sorrow is said to be the sorrow not of a Penitent but a desperate person. But because they who love God
						cannot but desire to obey the divine Law, and they who love their Neighbours cannot but desire to obey the morall Law, which consists as hath beene shewed above in the
						3. Chapter, in the prohibition of<hi rend="italic"> Pride, ingratitude, contumely, inhumanity, cruelty, injury,</hi> and the like offences, whereby our Neighbours are
						prejudic't, therefore also <hi rend="italic">Love </hi>or charity are aequivalent to <hi rend="italic">Obedience</hi>. Justice also (which is a constant will of giving
						to every man his due) is aequivalent with it. But that <hi rend="italic">Faith and Repentance</hi> are sufficient for Salvation, is manifest by the Covenant it selfe of
						Baptisme; for they who were by <hi rend="italic">Peter</hi> converted on the day of <hi rend="italic">Pentecost</hi>, demanding him what they should do? He answered,
						<hi rend="italic">Repent, and be Baptiz'd every one of you in the name of Jesus for the remission of your Sins.</hi> Act. 2. v. 38. There was nothing therefore to <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0399" n="344"/>be
						done for the obtaining of Baptisme, that is to say, for to enter into the Kingdome of God, but to <hi rend="italic">Repent, and beleeve</hi> in the Name of <hi
							rend="italic">JESUS</hi>. For the Kingdome of Heaven is promis'd by the Covenant which is made in Baptisme; farthermore, by the words of CHRIST answering the Lawyer
						who askt him what he should doe to inherit eternall life, Thou knowest the Commandements, <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt not Kill, Thou shalt not commit Adultery,
							&amp;amp;c. </hi>which refer to Obedience; and, <hi rend="italic">Sell all that thou hast, and come, and follow me</hi>, which relates to faith, <hi rend="italic"
							>Luke </hi>18. ver. 20. Mar. 10. ver. 18. And by that which is said, <hi rend="italic">The just shall live by Faith,</hi> (not every man, but the just) for <hi
							rend="italic">Justice </hi>is the same disposition of Will which <hi rend="italic">Repentance and Obedience are</hi>; And by the words of Saint Mark, <hi
							rend="italic">The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdome of God is at hand, Repent yee, and beleeve the Gospell</hi>, by which words is not obscurely signified that
						there is no need of other Vertues, for our entrance into the Kingdome of God, excepting those of <hi rend="italic">Repentance and Faith</hi>. The <hi rend="italic"
							>Obedience </hi>therefore which is <hi rend="italic">necessarily </hi>requir'd to Salvation is nothing else but <hi rend="italic">the Will</hi>, or <hi rend="italic"
							>endeavour </hi>to obey, that is to say, of doing according to the Lawes of God, that is the morall Lawes, which are the same to all men; and the civill Lawes, that
						is to say, the commands of Soveraignes in <hi rend="italic">temporall matters</hi>, and the Ecclesiasticall Lawes in <hi rend="italic">spirituall</hi>; which two kinds
						of Lawes are divers in divers Cities, and Churches, and are knowne by their promulgation, and publique sentences. <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0400" n="345"/></p>
					<p> IV. That we may understand what the <hi rend="italic">Christian Faith</hi> is, we must define <hi rend="italic">Faith </hi>in generall, and distinguish it from those
						other acts of the minde wherewith commonly it is confounded. <hi rend="italic">The object of Faith</hi> universally taken, namely for <hi rend="italic">that which is
							beleev'd</hi>, is evermore a <hi rend="italic">proposition</hi>, (that is to say a speech affirmative, or negative) which we grant to be true. But because
						Propositions are granted for divers causes, it falls out, that these kind of concessions are diversly called: But we grant Propositions sometimes which notwithstanding
						we receive not into our mindes; and this either for a time, to wit, so long, till by consideration of the consequencies, we have well examin'd the truth of them, which
						we call <hi rend="italic">supposing</hi>; or also simply, as through feare of the Lawes, which is <hi rend="italic">to professe</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">confesse
						</hi>by outward tokens; or for a voluntary compliance sake, which men use out of civility to those whom they respect, and for love of Peace to others, which is absolute
							<hi rend="italic">yeelding</hi>. Now the Propositions which we receive for truth, we alwaies grant for some reasons of our owne, and these are deriv'd either from the
							<hi rend="italic">Proposition </hi>it selfe, or from the<hi rend="italic"> person propounding</hi>. They are deriv'd from the <hi rend="italic">Proposition </hi>it
						selfe, by calling to minde what things those words which make up the Proposition doe by common consent usually signifie: if so, then the assent which we give is called
							<hi rend="italic">knowledge</hi>, or Science. But if we cannot remember what is certainly understood by those words, but sometimes one thing, sometimes another seeme
						to be apprehended by <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0401" n="346"/>us, then we are said to <hi rend="italic">thinke</hi>. For example, if it be propounded <hi rend="italic">that two and three makes five</hi>; and
						by calling to minde the order of those numerall words, that it is so appointed by the common consent of them who are of the same language with us, (as it were by a
						certaine contract necessary for humane society) that five shall be the name of so many unities as are contain'd in two and three taken together, a man assents, that
						this is therefore true because two and three together, are the same with five. This assent shall be called knowledge, and to know this truth is nothing else but to
						acknowledge that it is made by our selves; For by whose will and rules of speaking the number... is called two,... is called three, &amp;amp;c... is called five, by
						their will also it comes to passe, that this Proposition is true, <hi rend="italic">Two </hi>and <hi rend="italic">three </hi>taken together makes <hi rend="italic"
							>five</hi>. In like manner if we remember what it is that is called <hi rend="italic">theft</hi>, and what <hi rend="italic">injury</hi>, we shall <hi rend="italic"
							>understand </hi>by the words themselves, whether it be true that <hi rend="italic">theft is an injury</hi>, or not. <hi rend="italic">Truth </hi>is the same with <hi
							rend="italic">a true Proposition</hi>; but <hi rend="italic">the Proposition is true</hi> in which the <hi rend="italic">word consequent</hi>, which by <hi
							rend="italic">Logicians </hi>is called <hi rend="italic">the praedicate</hi>, embraceth the <hi rend="italic">word antecedent</hi> in its amplitude, which they call
							<hi rend="italic">the Subject</hi>; and to <hi rend="italic">know truth</hi> is the same thing as <hi rend="italic">to remember</hi> that it was made by our selves in
						the common use of words. Neither was it rashly, or unadvisedly said by <hi rend="italic">Plato </hi>of old, <hi rend="italic">that knowledge was memory</hi>. But it
						happens sometimes that words although they have a certaine, and defin'd signification by constitution, yet by vulgar <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0402" n="347"/>use either to adorne, or deceive, they are so
						wrested from their owne significations, that to remember the conceptions for which they were first impos'd on things is very hard, and not to be maistered but by a
						sharpe judgement, and very great diligence. It happens too, that there are many words which have no proper, determin'd, and every where the same signification; and are
						understood not by their owne, but by vertue of other signes us'd together with them. Thirdly, there are some words of things unconceivable; of those things therefore
						whereof they are the words, there is no conception; and therefore in vaine doe we seeke for the truth of those Propositions, which they make out of the words
						themselves. In these cases, while by considering the definitions of words we search out the truth of some proposition, according to the hope we have of finding it, we
						thinke it sometimes true, and sometimes false; either of which apart is called <hi rend="italic">thinking</hi>, and also <hi rend="italic">beleeving</hi>; both
						together, <hi rend="italic">doubting</hi>. But when our reasons for which we assent to some Proposition, derive not from the <hi rend="italic">Proposition it
						selfe</hi>, but from <hi rend="italic">the Person Propounding</hi>, whom we esteeme so learned that he is not deceiv'd, and we see no reason why he should deceive us;
						our assent, because it growes not from any <hi rend="italic">confidence </hi>of our owne, but from another mans knowledge, is called <hi rend="italic">Faith</hi>: And
						by the confidence of whom, we doe beleeve, we are said <hi rend="italic">to trust them</hi>, or to <hi rend="italic">trust in them</hi>. By what hath been said, the
						difference appeares first betweene <hi rend="italic">Faith</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Profession</hi>; for that is alwaies<pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0403" n="348"/> joyn'd with inward assent, this not alwayes;
						That is an inward perswasion of the minde, this an outward obedience. Next, betweene <hi rend="italic">Faith</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Opinion</hi>; for this depends
						on our owne reason, that on the good esteeme we have of another. Lastly betweene <hi rend="italic">Faith </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Knowledge</hi>; for this
						deliberately takes a proposition broken, and chewed; that swallowes downe whole and entire. The explication of words, whereby the matter enquir'd after is propounded,
						is conducible to knowledge; nay, the onely way <hi rend="italic">to know</hi>, is by <hi rend="italic">definition</hi>. But this is prejudiciall to <hi rend="italic"
							>Faith</hi>; for those things which exceede humane capacity, and are propounded to be beleev'd, are never more evident by explication, but on the contrary more
						obscure, and harder to be credited. And the same thing befalls a man who endeavours to demonstrate <hi rend="italic">the mysteries of Faith</hi> by naturall reason,
						which happens to a sick man, who will needs chew before he will swallow his wholsome, but bitter Pills; whence it comes to passe, that he presently brings them up
						againe, which perhaps would otherwise, if he had taken them well downe, have prov'd his remedy. </p>
					<p> V. We have seene therefore what it is <hi rend="italic">to beleeve</hi>. But what is it <hi rend="italic">to beleeve in</hi> CHRIST? Or what Proposition is that which
						is the object of our Faith in CHRIST? For when we say, <hi rend="italic">I beleeve in</hi> CHRIST, we signifie indeed Whom, but not What we beleeve. Now, <hi
							rend="italic">to beleeve in </hi>CHRIST is nothing else but to beleeve that JESUS IS THE CHRIST, namely Hee, who <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0404" n="349"/>according to the Prophesies of <hi rend="italic"
							>Moyses, and the Prophets of Israel</hi>, was to come into this world <hi rend="italic">to institute the Kingdome of God</hi>. And this sufficiently appeares out of
						the words of CHRIST himselfe to <hi rend="italic">Martha: I am </hi>(saith he) <hi rend="italic">the Resurrection and the life,</hi> HE THAT BELEEVETH IN ME, <hi
							rend="italic">though he were dead, yet he shall live, and</hi> WHOSOEVER LIVETH, AND BELEEVETH IN ME, <hi rend="italic">shall never dye. Beleevest thou this? She
							saith unto him, Yea Lord, I beleeve that</hi> THOU ART THE CHRIST <hi rend="italic">the Son of God, which should come into the world</hi>. John 11. ver. 25, 26, 27.
						In which words we see that the question BELEEVEST THOU. IN ME? is expounded by the answer, THOU ART THE CHRIST. To beleeve in CHRIST therefore is nothing else but to
						beleeve JESUS HIMSELFE saying that he is THE CHRIST. </p>
					<p> VI. <hi rend="italic">Faith </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Obedience </hi>both <hi rend="italic">necessarily concurring</hi> to Salvation, what kinde of Obedience that
						same is, and to whom due, hath beene shewed above in the 3. Article. But now we must enquire what <hi rend="italic">articles of Faith</hi> are requisite: And) I say,
						that to a Christian there is no other article of Faith requisite as <hi rend="italic">necessary </hi>to Salvation, but only this, THAT JESUS IS THE CHRIST. But we must
						distinguish (as we have already done before in the 4. Article) betweene <hi rend="italic">Faith</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Profession</hi>. A <hi rend="italic"
							>Profession </hi>therefore of more articles (if they be commanded) may be <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi>. for it is a part of our <hi rend="italic">obedience
							</hi>due to the Lawes; but we <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0405" n="350"/>enquire not now what <hi rend="italic">Obedience</hi>, but what <hi rend="italic">Faith </hi>is <hi rend="italic">necessary </hi>to
						salvation. And this is prov'd first out of the scope of the Evangelists which was by the description of our Saviours life to establish this one Article. And we shall
						know that such was the scope, and counsell of the Evangelists, if we observe but the History it selfe. Saint <hi rend="italic">Matthew </hi>beginning at his Genealogy
						shewes that JESUS was of the linage of <hi rend="italic">David</hi>, borne of a Virgin, <hi rend="italic">Chap</hi>. 1. that He was adored by the <hi rend="italic">Wise
							men</hi> as King of the <hi rend="italic">Jewes</hi>; that <hi rend="italic">Herod </hi>for the same cause sought to slay him, <hi rend="italic">Chap</hi>. 2. That
						his Kingdome was Preacht both by <hi rend="italic">John the Baptist</hi>, and Himselfe, <hi rend="italic">Chap</hi>. 3, 4. That He taught the Lawes, not as the <hi
							rend="italic">Scribes</hi>, but as one having authority, <hi rend="italic">Chap</hi>. 5, 6, 7. That he cur'd diseases miraculously, Chap. 8, 9. That He sent his <hi
							rend="italic">Apostles </hi>the Preachers of his Kingdome throughout all the parts of <hi rend="italic">Judea</hi>, to proclame his Kingdome, <hi rend="italic"
						>Chap</hi>. 10. That He commanded the Messengers sent from <hi rend="italic">John </hi>to enquire whether he were the CHRIST or not, to tell him what they had seene,
						namely the miracles which were onely competible with CHRIST, <hi rend="italic">Chap</hi>. 11. That he prov'd and declar'd his Kingdome to the <hi rend="italic"
							>Pharisees</hi>, and others by arguments, parables and signes, <hi rend="italic">Chap</hi>: 12. and the following Chapters to the 21. That He maintain'd himselfe to
						be the <hi rend="italic">Christ </hi>against the <hi rend="italic">Pharisees</hi>, That He was saluted with the title of King, when he entred into <hi rend="italic"
							>Jerusalem</hi>, Chap. 21. That he forewarn'd others of <hi rend="italic">false Christs</hi>, and That He shewed in Parables what manner of Kingdome <pb
								entity="DSSR_000002537_0406" n="351"/>his should be,
						Chap. 22, 23, 24, 25. That He was taken, and accused for this reason, because He said He was a King; and that a Title was written on his Crosse, THIS IS JESUS, THE KING
						OF THE JEWES, Chap. 26, 27. Lastly, that after his resurrection, He told his Apostles that all power was given unto Him both in Heaven, and in Earth, Chap. 28. All
						which tends to this end, That we should beleeve Jesus to be the Christ. Such therefore was the Scope of Saint <hi rend="italic">Matthew </hi>in describing his Gospell;
						but such as his was, such also was the rest of the Evangelists; which Saint <hi rend="italic">Iohn </hi>sets down expresly in the end of his Gospel, These things (saith
						He) are written, that ye may know that Jesus is the Christ, the Sonne of the living God. <hi rend="italic">Iohn </hi>20. vers. 31. </p>
					<p> I say, that to a Christian. <hi rend="italic">Although I conceive this assertion to be sufficiently proved by the following reasons, yet I thought it worth my labour
							to make a more ample explication of it, because I perceive that being somewhat new, it may possibly be distastfull to many Divines. First therefore when I say this
							Article,</hi> That Jesus is the Christ, <hi rend="italic">is necessary to salvation; I say not that Faith onely is necessary, but I require justice also, or that
							Obedience which is due to the Lawes of God, that is to say, a Will to live righteously. Secondly, I deny not but the profession of many Articles, (provided that that
							profession be commanded by the Church) is also necessary to salvation; but seeing Faith is internall, Profession externall, I say that the former onely is properly
							Faith; the latter a part of Obedience; insomuch as that Article <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0407" n="352"/>alone sufficeth for inward beleefe, but is not sufficient for the outward profession of a Christian.
							Lastly, even as if I had said that true and inward Repentance of sinnes was onely necessary to salvation, yet were it not to be held for a Paradox, because we suppose
							justice, Obedience, and a mind reformed in all manner of vertues to be contained in it: so when I say that the Faith of one Article is sufficient to salvation, it may
							well be lesse wondred at, seeing that in it so many other Articles are contained. For these words,</hi> Jesus is the Christ,<hi rend="italic"> do signifie that Jesus
							was that Person whom God had promised by his Prophets should come into the world to establish his Kingdom, that is to say, that Jesus is the Sonne of God, the
							Creatour of Heaven and Earth, born of a Virgin, dying for the sinnes of them who should beleeve in Him; that Hee was Christ, that is to say a King; that He reviv'd
							(for else He were not like to reign) to judge the world, and to reward every one according to his works, for otherwise he cannot be a King; also that men shall rise
							again, for otherwise they are not like to come to judgement. The whole Symbol of the Apostles is therefore contained in this one Article; which notwithstanding I
							thought reasonable to contract thus, because I found that many men for this alone, without the rest, were admitted into the Kingdome of God, both by Christ, and his
							Apostles; as the Thief on the Crosse, the Eunuch baptized by </hi>Philip,<hi rend="italic"> the two thousand men converted to the Church at once by Saint </hi>Peter.
							<hi rend="italic">But if any man be displeased that I doe not judge all those eternally damned, who doe not inwardly assent to every Article defined by the Church
								(and yet doe not contradict, but if they be commanded, doe <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0408" n="353"/>submit) I know not what I shall say to them; for the most evident Testimonies of Holy Writ which doe
							follow, doe withhold me from altering my opinion.</hi>
					</p>
					<p> VII. Secondly, this is proved by the preaching of the Apostles. For they were the Proclamers of his Kingdome, neither did Christ send them to preach ought but the
						Kingdome of God, <hi rend="italic">Luke </hi>9. vers. 2. <hi rend="italic">Act</hi>. 15. vers. 6. And what they did after Christ his Ascension may be understood by the
						accusation which was brought against them, <hi rend="italic">They drew</hi> Jason (saith Saint <hi rend="italic">Luke</hi>)<hi rend="italic"> and certain Brethren unto
							the Rulers of the City, crying, These are the men that have turned the world upside down, and are come hither also, whom Jason hath received; and these all do
							contrary to the decrees of </hi>Caesar,<hi rend="italic"> saying that there is another King, one Jesus.</hi> Acts 17. vers. 6, 7. It appears also what the subject of
						the Apostles Sermons was, out of these words: <hi rend="italic">Opening, and alleadging out of the Scriptures </hi>(to wit, of the old Testament) <hi rend="italic">that
							Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead, and that</hi> THIS JESUS IS THE CHRIST. <hi rend="italic">Acts </hi>17. vers. 2, 3. </p>
					<p> VIII. Thirdly, By the places in which the easinesse of those things which are required by Christ to the attaining of salvation, is declared. For if an internall
						assent of the minde were necessarily required to the truth of all and each Proposition which this day is controverted about the Christian Faith, or by divers Churches
						is diversly defined, there would be nothing more difficult then the Christian Religion. And how then would that be true, <hi rend="italic">My yoke is easie, <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0409" n="354"/>and my
							burthen light?</hi> Mat. 11. vers. 30. and <hi rend="italic">that litle ones doe beleeve in Him?</hi> Mat. 18. vers. 6. and that <hi rend="italic">it pleased God by
							the foolishnesse of Preaching, to save those that beleeve?</hi> 1 Cor. 1. vers. 21. or how was the thiefe hanging on the Crosse sufficiently instructed to salvation,
						the confession of whose Faith was contained in these words, <hi rend="italic">Lord remember me when thou comest into thy Kingdome</hi>; or how could Saint <hi
							rend="italic">Paul </hi>himselfe, from an enemy, so soon become a Doctor of Christians? </p>
					<p> IX. Fourthly, by this, that that Article is the foundation of Faith, neither rests it on any other foundation. <hi rend="italic">If any man shall say unto you, Loe
							here is Christ, or He is there, beleeve it not, for there shall arise false Christs, and false Prophets, and shall shew great signes, and wonders,
						&amp;amp;c</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Mat</hi>. 24. vers. 23. Whence it followes, that for the Faiths sake which we have in this Article, we must not beleeve any
						signes, and wonders. <hi rend="italic">Although we, or an Angell from Heaven</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi rend="italic">should preach to you any other Gospel, then what
							we have preacht, let him be accursed.</hi> Gal. 1. 8. By reason of this Article therefore we might not trust the very Apostles, and Angels themselves (and therefore I
						conceive not the Church neither) if they should teach the contrary. <hi rend="italic">Beloved, beleeve not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God,
							because many false Prophets are gone out into the world, hereby know yee the spirit of God, every spirit that confesseth Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God,
							&amp;amp;c</hi>. 1 John 4. vers. 1, 2. That Article therefore is the measure of the Spirits whereby the authority <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0410" n="355"/>of the Doctors, is either received, or rejected.
						It cannot be denied indeed, but that all who at this day are Christians, did learn from the Doctors, that it was Jesus who did all those things whereby he might be
						acknowledged to be the Christ; yet it followes not that the same Persons beleeved that Article for the Doctors, or the Churches, but for Jesus his own sake. For that
						Article was before <hi rend="italic">the Christian Church</hi>, although all the rest were after it, and the <hi rend="italic">Church </hi>was founded upon it, not it
						upon <hi rend="italic">the Church</hi>. Mat. 16. vers. 18. Besides, this Article, that <hi rend="italic">Jesus is the Christ,</hi> is so fundamentall, that all the rest
						are by Saint <hi rend="italic">Paul </hi>said to be built upon it, <hi rend="italic">For other foundation can no man lay, then that which is layd, which is Jesus
						Christ</hi> (that is to say, that <hi rend="italic">Jesus is the Christ</hi>). <hi rend="italic">Now if any man build uPon this foundation, gold, silver, precious
							stone, wood, hay, stubble; every mans work shall be made manifest: If any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward; if any mans work
							shall be burnt, he shall suffer losse, but he himselfe shall be saved.</hi> 1 Cor. 3. vers. 11, 12, 13. &amp;amp;c. From whence it plainly appears, that by
						foundation is understood this Article, THAT JESUS IS THE CHRIST. For gold, and silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble (whereby the Doctrines are signified) are not
						built upon the Person of <hi rend="italic">Christ</hi>; and also, that false Doctrines may be raised upon this foundation, vet not so, as they must necessarily be
						damned who teach them. </p>
					<p> X. Lastly, that this Article alone is needfull to be inwardly beleeved, may be <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0411" n="356"/>most evidently proved out of many places of holy Scriptures, let who will be the <hi
							rend="italic">Interpreter: Search the Scriptures, for in them yee think yee have eternall life; and they are they which testify of me</hi>. John 5. 39. But Christ
						meant the Scriptures of the old Testament only: for the new was then not yet written. Now, there is no other testimony concerning Christ in the old Testament, but that
						an eternall King was to come in such a place, that He was to be born of such Parents, that He was to teach, and doe such things; whereby, as by certain signes, he was
						to be knowne: All which testify this one thing, that JESUS who was so born, and did teach, and doe such things, was THE CHRIST. Other Faith then was not required to
						attain eternall life, besides this Article. <hi rend="italic">Whosoever liveth and beleeveth in me, shall never dye.</hi> John 11. vers. 25. But to beleeve in Jesus (as
						is there exprest) is the same with beleeving that JESUS WAS THE CHRIST. He therefore that beleeves that, shall never dye, and by consequence, that Article alone is
						necessary to salvation. <hi rend="italic">These are written that yee might beleeve that</hi> JESUS IS THE CHRIST <hi rend="italic">the Sonne of God, and that beleeving
							yee might have life through his name.</hi> Jo. 20. vers. 31. Wherefore he that beleeves thus, shall have eternall life, and therefore needs no other Faith. <hi
							rend="italic">Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God.</hi> 1 Jo. 4. v. 2. And, <hi rend="italic">Whosoever beleeveth that
							</hi>JESUS IS THE CHRIST, <hi rend="italic">is born of God.</hi> 1 Jo. 5. vers. 1. And, <hi rend="italic">Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that <pb
								entity="DSSR_000002537_0412" n="357"/>beleeveth
							that IESUS is the Son of God?</hi> 1 Jo. 5. v. 5. If therefore there be no need to beleeve any thing else, to the end a man may be <hi rend="italic">of God, born of
							God</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">overcome the world,</hi> then that <hi rend="italic">IESUS IS THE CHRIST</hi>. that one Article then is sufficient to salvation. <hi
							rend="italic">See, here is water, what doth hinder me to be baptized? And Philip said, If thou beleevest with all thine heart, thou maist. And he answered and said, I
							beleeve that IESUS CHRIST is the Sonne of God. Acts</hi> 8. vers. 36, 37. If then this Article being beleeved with the whole heart, (that is to say, with inward
						Faith) was sufficient for Baptisme, it is also sufficient for salvation. Besides these places there are innumerable others which doe clearly, and expresly affirm the
						same thing. Nay, wheresoever wee read that our Saviour commended the Faith of any one, or that he said, <hi rend="italic">Thy Faith hath saved thee,</hi> or that he
						healed any one for his Faiths sake, there the Proposition beleeved was no other but this, <hi rend="italic">IESUS IS THE CHRIST,</hi> either directly, or consequently. </p>
					<p> XI. But because no man can beleeve <hi rend="italic">IESUS TO BE THE CHRIST,</hi> who, when he knowes that by <hi rend="italic">Christ </hi>is understood that same
						King who was promised from God by <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>, and the Prophets, for to be the <hi rend="italic">King</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Saviour </hi>of the
						world, doth not also beleeve <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Prophets</hi>, neither can he beleeve these, who beleeves not that <hi
							rend="italic">God is</hi>, and that <hi rend="italic">he governs the world</hi>; it is necessary that the Faith of God, and of the old Testament be contained in this
						Faith of the new. Seeing <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0413" n="358"/>therefore that Atheisme, and the deniall of the Divine Providence, were the only treason against the Divine Majesty in the Kingdome of God by
						Nature; but Idolatry also in the Kingdome of God by the Old Covenant; now in this Kingdome wherein God rules by way of a new Covenant, apostasie is also added, or the
						renunciation of this article once receiv'd, that JESUS IS THE CHRIST. Truly other Doctrines, provided they have their determination from a lawfull Church, are not to be
						contradicted; for that is the sinne of disobedience; but it hath been fully declar'd before that they are not needfull to be beleev'd with an <hi rend="italic">inward
							Faith</hi>. </p>
					<p> XII. <hi rend="italic">Faith and Obedience</hi> have divers parts in accomplishing the salvation of a Christian; for this contributes the <hi rend="italic"
						>power</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">capacity</hi>; that the <hi rend="italic">Act</hi>. And either is said to justifie in its kinde. For <hi rend="italic">Christ
						</hi>forgives not the sins of all men, but of the <hi rend="italic">Penitent</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">Obedient</hi>, that is to say the <hi rend="italic"
						>just</hi>, I say not the <hi rend="italic">guiltlesse</hi>, but the <hi rend="italic">just</hi>; for <hi rend="italic">justice </hi>is a Will of obeying the Lawes, and
						may be consistent with a sinner, and with Christ the Will to obey is Obedience; for not every man, but <hi rend="italic">the just shall live by Faith</hi>. <hi
							rend="italic">Obedience </hi>therefore <hi rend="italic">justifies </hi>because it <hi rend="italic">maketh just</hi> in the same manner as <hi rend="italic"
							>temperance </hi>maketh <hi rend="italic">temperate</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Prudence Prudent, Chastity chaste,</hi> namely essentially; and puts a man in such a
						state, as makes him capable of pardon. Againe, <hi rend="italic">Christ </hi>hath not promis'd forgivenesse of sinnes to all just men, but only <hi rend="italic">those
							of them who beleeve Him to be the Christ. Faith</hi> therefore <hi rend="italic">justifies </hi>in such a sense as a judge may be said <hi rend="italic">to
								justifie</hi> who <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0414" n="359"/><hi rend="italic">absolves</hi>; namely by the <hi rend="italic">sentence </hi>which <hi rend="italic">actually </hi>saves a man. And in this
						acception of justification (for it is an aequivocall terme) <hi rend="italic">Faith alone</hi> justifies, but in the other, <hi rend="italic">Obedience onely</hi>: but
						neither Obedience alone nor Faith alone doe <hi rend="italic">save </hi>us, but both together. </p>
					<p> XIII. By what hath been said hitherto, it will be easy to discerne what the duty of Christian Subjects is towards their Soveraignes, who as long as they professe
						themselves Christians cannot command their Subjects to deny Christ, or to offer him any contumely; for if they should command this, they would professe themselves to be
						no Christians. For seeing we have shewed both by naturall reason, and out of holy Scriptures, that Subjects ought in all things to obey their Princes and Governours,
						excepting those which are contrary to the command of God; and that the commands of God in a Christian City concerning <hi rend="italic">temporall affairs</hi>, (that is
						to say, those which are to be discust by humane reason) are the Lawes and sentence of the City deliver'd from those who have receiv'd authority from the City to make
						Laws, and judge of controversies; but concerning spirituall matters; (that is to, say those which are to be defin'd by the holy Scripture) are the Lawes, and sentences
						of the City, that is to say the Church (for a Christian City, and a Church, as hath beene shewed in the foregoing Chapter in the 10. Art. are the same thing) deliv'rd
						by Pastors lawfully ordain'd, and who have to that end authority given them by the City; it <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0415" n="360"/>manifestly followes, that in a Christian Common weale, Obedience is due to
						the Soveraign in all things,<hi rend="italic"> as well Spirituall, as Temporall</hi>. And that the same obedience even from a Christian subject is due in all <hi
							rend="italic">temporall matters</hi> to those Princes who are no Christians, is without any controversie; but in <hi rend="italic">matters spirituall</hi>, that is to
						say, those things which concern Gods worship, some <hi rend="italic">christian Church</hi> is to be followed. For it is an hypothesis of the Christian Faith, that God
						speaks not in things supernaturall, but by the way of Christian Interpreters of holy Scriptures. But what? Must we resist Princes when we cannot obey them? Truly no;
						for this is contrary to our civill Covenant. What must we doe then? Goe to Christ by Martyrdome. Which if it seem to any man to be an hard saying, most certain it is
						that he beleeves not with his whole heart <hi rend="italic">THAT IESUS IS THE CHRIST</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Sonne of the living God,</hi> (for he would then desire
						to be dissolved, and to be with Christ) but he would by a feigned Christian Faith elude that obedience which he hath contracted to yeeld up unto the City. </p>
					<p> XIV. But some men perhaps will wonder, if, (excepting this one Article, that <hi rend="italic">IESUS IS THE CHRIST</hi>, which only is necessary to salvation in
						relation to internall faith) all the rest belong to obedience, which may be performed, although a man doe not inwardly beleeve, (so he doe but desire to beleeve, and
						make an outward profession, as oft as need requires, of whatsoever is propounded by the Church); how it comes about that there are so many Tenets <pb
							entity="DSSR_000002537_0416" n="361"/>which are all held so
						to concern our Faith, that except a man doe inwardly beleeve them, He cannot enter into the Kingdome of Heaven. But if he consider that in most controversies the
						contention is about humane Soveraignty; in some, matter of gain, and profit; in others, the glory of Wits; he will surely wonder the lesse. The question about <hi
							rend="italic">the propriety of the Church</hi>, is a question about the <hi rend="italic">Right of Soveraignty</hi>; for, it being known what a <hi rend="italic"
							>Church </hi>is, it is known at once to whom the Rule over Christians doth belong. For if every Christian City be that Church which Christ himselfe hath commanded
						every Christian subject to that city, to hear, then every subject is bound to obey his City, that is to say, Him, or them who have the supreme power, not only <hi
							rend="italic">in temporall</hi> but also <hi rend="italic">in spirituall matters</hi>. But if every Christian City be not that Church, then is there some other Church
						more universall, which must be obeyed. All Christians therefore must obey that Church just as they would obey Christ if He came upon Earth. She will therfore rule
						either by the way of Monarchy, or by some Assembly: This question then concerns the <hi rend="italic">Right of ruling</hi>. To the same end belongs the question
						concerning <hi rend="italic">infallibility</hi>; for whosoever were truly, and internally beleeved by all mankinde, that he could not erre, would be sure of all
						Dominion, as well <hi rend="italic">temporall </hi>as <hi rend="italic">spirituall</hi>, over all mankinde, unlesse himselfe would refuse it; for if he say that he must
						be obeyed in <hi rend="italic">temporalls</hi>, because it is supposed he cannot erre, that Right of Dominion is immediately granted him. Hither also tends the
						priviledge of <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0417" n="362"/>interpreting Scriptures. For he to whom it belongs to interpret the controversies arising from the divers interpretations of Scriptures, hath authority
						also simply and absolutely to determine all manner of controversies whatsoever. but he who hath this, hath also the command over all men who acknowledge the Scriptures
						to be the Word of God. To this end drive all the disputes about <hi rend="italic">the power of remitting, and retaining sinnes</hi>; or the <hi rend="italic">authority
							of excommunication</hi>. For every man, if he be in his wits, will in all things yeeld that man an absolute obedience, by vertue of whose sentence he beleeves
						himselfe to be either saved, or damned. Hither also tends the power of <hi rend="italic">instituting societies</hi>; for they depend on him by whom they subsist, who
						hath as many subjects as Monks, although living in an Enemies City. To this end also refers the question concerning the <hi rend="italic">Iudge of lawfull
						Matrimony</hi>; for he to whom that judicature belongs, to him also pertains the knowledge of all those cases which concern the inheritance, and succession to all the
						goods, and Rights, not of private men onely, but also of Soveraign Princes. And hither also in some respect tends the <hi rend="italic">Virgin-life of Ecclesiasticall
							Persons</hi>; for unmarried men have lesse coherence then others with civill society: and besides, it is an inconvenience not to be slighted, that Princes must either
						necessarily forgoe the Priesthood (which is a great bond of civill obedience) or have no hereditary Kingdome. To this end also tends the <hi rend="italic">canonization
							of Saints</hi> which the Heathen called <hi rend="italic">Apotheosis</hi>; for he that can allure <pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0418" n="363"/>forraign subjects with so great a reward, may bring those who are
						greedy of such glory to dare, and doe any thing. For what was it but an honourable Name with posterity? which the <hi rend="italic">Decii </hi>and other Romans sought
						after, and a thousand others who cast themselves upon incredible perils? The controversies about <hi rend="italic">Purgatory</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
						>indulgencies</hi>, are matter of gain. The questions of <hi rend="italic">Free-will, Iustification,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the manner of receiving Christ in the
							Sacrament</hi>, are Philosophicall. There are also questions concerning some Rites not introduced, but left in the Church not sufficiently purged from gentilisme; but
						we need reckon no more. All the world knows that such is the nature of men, that dissenting in questions which concern their <hi rend="italic">Power</hi>, or <hi
							rend="italic">profit</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">preeminence of Wit</hi>, they slander, and curse each other. It is not therefore to be wondred at, if almost all
						tenets (after men grew hot with disputings) are held forth by some or other to be <hi rend="italic">necessary </hi>to salvation, and for our entrance into the Kingdome
						of Heaven; insomuch as they who hold them not, are not only condemned as guilty of disobedience (which in truth they are after the Church hath once defined them) but of
						Infidelity, which I have declared above to be wrong out of many evident places of Scripture; to which I adde this one of Saint <hi rend="italic">Pauls, Let not him that
							eateth, despise him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not, judge him that eateth; for God hath received him. One man esteemeth one day above another,
							another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully perswaded in his own mind,</hi> Rom. 14. v. 3, 5.<lb/>FINIS</p><pb entity="DSSR_000002537_0419"/>
