          <p><hi rend="italic">The recruited Actors in the</hi> Hay-Market <hi rend="italic"
              >encourag'd by a Subscription.</hi> Drury-Lane <hi rend="italic">under a particular
              Menagement. The Power of a Lord-Chamberlain over the Theatres consider'd. How it had
              been formerly exercis'd. A Digression to Tragick Authors.</hi></p>

          <p>HAVING shewn the particular Conduct of the Patentee in refusing so fair an Opportunity
            of securing to himself both Companies under his sole Power and Interest, I shall now
            lead the Reader, after a short View of what pass'd in this new Establishment of the <hi
              rend="italic">Hay-Market</hi> Theatre, to the Accidents <pb n="2"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0023"/> that the Year following compell'd the same Patentee to
            receive both Companies, united, into the <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi> Theatre,
            notwithstanding his Disinclination to it.</p>
          <p>It may now be imagin'd that such a Detachment of Actors from <hi rend="italic"
              >Drury-Lane</hi> could not but give a new Spirit to those in the <hi rend="italic"
              >Hay-Market</hi>; not only by enabling them to act each others Plays to better
            Advantage, but by an emulous Industry which had lain too long inactive among them, and
            without which they plainly saw they could not be sure of Subsistence. Plays by this
            means began to recover a good Share of their former Esteem and Favour; and the Profits
            of them in about a Month enabled our new Menager to discharge his Debt (of something
            more than Two hundred Pounds) to his old Friend the Patentee, who had now left him and
            his Troop in trust to fight their own Battles. The greatest Inconvenience they still
            laboured under was the immoderate Wideness of their House, in which, as I have observ'd,
            the Difficulty of Hearing may be said to have bury'd half the Auditors Entertainment.
            This Defect seem'd evident from the much better Reception several new Plays (first acted
            there) met with when they afterwards came to be play'd by the same Actors in <hi
              rend="italic">Drury-Lane:</hi> Of this Number were the <hi rend="italic">Stratagem</hi>
            <ref target="n2-1" n="1">[2.1]</ref> and the <hi rend="italic">Wife's <pb n="3"
                entity="DSSR_000002933_0024"/> Resentment</hi>; <ref target="n3-1" n="2">[3.1]</ref>
            to which I may add the <hi rend="italic">Double Gallant.</hi>
            <ref target="n3-2" n="3">[3.2]</ref> This last was a Play made up of what little was
            tolerable in two or three others that had no Success, and were laid aside as so much
            Poetical Lumber; but by collecting and adapting the best parts of them all into one
            Play, the <hi rend="italic">Double Gallant</hi> has had a Place every Winter amongst the
            Publick Entertainments these Thirty Years. As I was only the Compiler of this Piece I
              <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000002933_0025"/> did not publish it in my own Name; but as my
            having but a Hand in it could not be long a Secret, I have been often treated as a
            Plagiary on that Account: Not that I think I have any right to complain of whatever
            would detract from the Merit of that sort of Labour, yet a Cobler may be allow'd to be
            useful though he is not famous: <ref target="n4-1" n="4">[4.1]</ref> And I hope a Man is
            not blameable for doing a little Good, tho' he cannot do as much as another? But so it
            is&mdash;Twopenny Criticks must live as well as Eighteenpenny Authors! <ref
              target="n4-2" n="5">[4.2]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>While the Stage was thus recovering its former Strength, a more honourable Mark of
            Favour was shewn to it than it was ever known before or since to have receiv'd. The then
            Lord <hi rend="italic">Hallifax</hi> was not only the Patron of the Men of Genius of
            this Time, but had likewise a generous Concern for the Reputation and Prosperity of the
            Theatre, from whence the most elegant Dramatick Labours of the Learned, he knew, had
            often shone in their brightest Lustre. A Proposal therefore was drawn up and addressed
            to that Noble Lord for his Approbation and Assistance to raise a publick Subscription
            for Reviving Three Plays of the best Authors, with the full Strength of the Company;
            every Subscriber to have Three Tickets for the first Day of each Play for <pb n="5"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0026"/> his single Payment of Three Guineas. This Subscription
            his Lordship so zealously encouraged, that from his Recommendation chiefly, in a very
            little time it was compleated. The Plays were <hi rend="italic">Julius
            C&aelig;sar</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">King
              and no King</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Fletcher,</hi> and the Comic Scenes of <hi
              rend="italic">Dryden</hi>'s <hi rend="italic">Marriage &agrave; la mode</hi> and
            of his <hi rend="italic">Maiden Queen</hi> put together. <ref target="n5-1" n="6"
            >[5.1]</ref> for it was judg'd that, as these comic Episodes were' utterly independent
            of the serious Scenes they were originally written to, they might on this occasion be as
            well Episodes either to the other, and so make up five livelier Acts between them: At
            least the Project so well succeeded, that those comic Parts have never since been
            replaced, but were continued to be jointly acted as one Play several Years after.</p>
          <p>By the Aid of this Subscription, which happen'd in 1707, and by the additional Strength
            and Industry of this Company, not only the Actors (several of which were handsomely
            advanc'd in their Sallaries) were duly paid, but the Menager himself, too, at the Foot
            of his Account, stood a considerable Gainer.</p>
          <pb n="6" entity="DSSR_000002933_0027"/>
          <p>At the same time the Patentee of <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi> went on in his usual
            Method of paying extraordinary Prices to Singers, Dancers, and other exotick Performers,
            which were as constantly deducted out of the sinking Sallaries of his Actors: 'Tis true
            his Actors perhaps might not deserve much more than he gave them; yet, by what I have
            related, it is plain he chose not to be troubled with such as visibly had deserv'd more:
            For it seems he had not purchas'd his Share of the Patent to mend the Stage, but to make
            Money of it: And to say Truth, his Sense of every thing to be shewn there was much upon
            a Level with the Taste of the Multitude, whose Opinion and whose Money weigh'd with him
            full as much as that of the best Judges. His Point was to please the Majority, who could
            more easily comprehend any thing they <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> than the daintiest
            things that could be said to them. But in this Notion he kept no medium; for in my
            Memory he carry'd it so far that he was (some few Years before this time) actually
            dealing for an extraordinary large Elephant at a certain Sum for every Day he might
            think fit to shew the tractable Genius of that vast quiet Creature in any Play or Farce
            in the Theatre (then standing) in <hi rend="italic">Dorset-Garden.</hi> But from the
            Jealousy which so formidable a Rival had rais'd in his Dancers, and by his Bricklayer's
            assuring him that if the Walls were to be open'd wide enough for its Entrance it might
            endanger the fall of the House, he gave up his Project, and with it so hopeful a
            Prospect of <pb n="7" entity="DSSR_000002933_0028"/> making the Receipts of the Stage
            run higher than all the Wit and Force of the best Writers had ever yet rais'd them to.
              <ref target="n7-1" n="7">[7.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>About the same time of his being under this Disappointment he put in Practice another
            Project of as new, though not of so bold a Nature; which was his introducing a Set of
            Rope-dancers into the same Theatre; for the first Day of whose Performance he had given
            out some Play in which I had a material Part: But I was hardy enough to go into the Pit
            and acquaint the Spectators near me, that I hop'd they would not think it a Mark of my
            Disrespect to them, if I declin'd acting upon any Stage that was brought to so low a
            Disgrace as ours was like to be by that Day's Entertainment. My Excuse was so well taken
            that I never after found any ill Consequences, or heard of the least Disapprobation of
            it: And the whole Body of Actors, too, protesting against such an Abuse of their
            Profession, our cautious Master was too much alarm'd and intimidated to repeat it.</p>
          <p>After what I have said, it will be no wonder that all due Regards to the original Use
            and Institution of the Stage should be utterly lost or neglected: Nor was the Conduct of
            this Menager easily to be alter'd while he had found the Secret of making Money out <pb
              n="8" entity="DSSR_000002933_0029"/> of Disorder and Confusion: For however strange it
            may seem, I have often observ'd him inclin'd to be cheerful in the Distresses of his
            Theatrical Affairs, and Equally reserv'd and pensive when they went smoothly forward
            with a visible Profit. Upon a Run of good Audiences he was more frighted to be thought a
            Gainer, which might make him accountable to others, than he was dejected with bad
            Houses, which at worst he knew would make others accountable to him: And as, upon a
            moderate Computation, it cannot be supposed that the contested Accounts of a twenty
            Year's Wear and Tear in a Play-house could be fairly adjusted by a Master in Chancery
            under four-score Years more, it will be no Surprize that by the Neglect, or rather the
            Discretion, of other Proprietors in not throwing away good Money after bad, this Hero of
            a Menager, who alone supported the War, should in time so fortify himself by Delay, and
            so tire his Enemies, that he became sole Monarch of his Theatrical Empire, and left the
            quiet Possession of it to his Successors.</p>
          <p>If these Facts seem to trivial for the Attention of a sensible Reader, let it be
            consider'd that they are not chosen Fictions to <hi rend="italic">entertain</hi>, but
            Truths necessary to <hi rend="italic">inform</hi> him under what low Shifts and
            Disgraces, what Disorders and Revolutions, the Stage labour'd before it could recover
            that Strength and Reputation wherewith it began to flourish towards the latter End of
            Queen <hi rend="italic">Anne</hi>'s Reign; and which it continued to enjoy for a Course
            of twenty Years <pb n="9" entity="DSSR_000002933_0030"/> following. But let us resume
            our Account of the new Settlement in the <hi rend="italic">Hay-Market.</hi></p>
          <p>It may be a natural Question why the Actors whom <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> brought
            over to his Undertaking in the <hi rend="italic">Hay-Market</hi> would tie themselves
            down to limited Sallaries? for though he as their Menager was obliged to make them
            certain Payments, it was not certain that the Receipts would enable him to do it; and
            since their own Industry was the only visible Fund they had to depend upon, why would
            they not for that Reason insist upon their being Sharers as well of possible Profits as
            Losses? How far in this Point they acted right or wrong will appear from the following
            State of their Case.</p>
          <p>It must first be consider'd that this Scheme of their Desertion was all concerted and
            put in Execution in a Week's Time, which short Warning might make them overlook that
            Circumstance, and the sudden Prospect of being deliver'd from having seldom more than
            half their Pay was a Contentment that had bounded all their farther Views. Besides, as
            there could be no room to doubt of their receiving their full Pay previous to any
            Profits that might be reap'd by their Labour, and as they had no great Reason to
            apprehend those Profits could exceed their respective Sallaries so far as to make them
            repine at them, they might think it but reasonable to let the Chance of any
            extraordinary Gain be on the Side of their Leader and Director. But farther, as this
            Scheme had the Approbation of the Court, these Actors in <pb n="10"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0031"/> reality had it not in their Power to alter any Part of
            it: And what induced the Court to encourage it was, that by having the Theatre and its
            Menager more immediately dependent on the Power of the Lord Chamberlain, it was not
            doubted but the Stage would be recover'd into such a reputation as might now do Honour
            to that absolute Command which the Court or its Officers seem'd always fond of having
            over it.</p>
          <p>Here, to set the Constitution of the Stage in a clearer Light, it may not be amiss to
            look back a little on the Power of a Lord Chamberlain, which, as may have been observ'd
            in all Changes of the Theatrical Government, has been the main Spring without which no
            Scheme of what kind soever could be set in Motion. My Intent is not to enquire how far
            by Law this Power has been limited or extended; but merely as an Historian to relate
            Facts to gratify the Curious, and then leave them to their own Reflections: This, too, I
            am the more inclin'd to, because there is no one Circumstance which has affected the
            Stage wherein so many Spectators, from those of the highest Rank to the Vulgar, have
            seem'd more positively knowing or less inform'd in.</p>
          <p>Though in all the Letters Patent for acting Plays, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi>
            since King <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi> the <hi rend="italic">First</hi>'s Time there
            has been no mention of the Lord Chamberlain, or of any Subordination to his Command or
            Authority, yet it was still taken for granted that no Letters Patent, by the bare
            Omission of such a great Officer's Name, <pb n="11" entity="DSSR_000002933_0032"/> could
            have superseded or taken out of his Hands that Power which Time out of Mind he always
            had exercised over the Theatre. <ref target="n11-1" n="8">[11.1]</ref> The common
            Opinions then abroad were, that if the Profession of Actors was unlawful, it was not in
            the Power of the Crown to license it; and if it were not unlawful, it ought to be free
            and independent as other Professions; and that a Patent to exercise it was only an
            honorary Favour from the Crown to give it a better Grace of Recommendation to the
            Publick. But as the Truth of this Question seem'd to be wrapt in a great deal of
            Obscurity, in the old Laws made in former Reigns relating to Players, <hi rend="italic"
              >&amp;c.</hi> it may be no Wonder that the best Companies of Actors should be
            desirous of taking Shelter under the visible Power of a Lord Chamberlain who they knew
            had at his Pleasure favoured and protected or born hard upon them: But be all this as it
            may, a Lord Chamberlain (from whencesoever his Power might be derived) had till of later
            Years had always an implicit Obedience paid to it: I shall now give some few Instances
            in what manner it was exercised.</p>
          <p>What appear'd to be most reasonably under his Cognizance was the licensing or refusing
            new Plays, <pb n="12" entity="DSSR_000002933_0033"/> or striking out what might be
            thought offensive in them: Which Province had been for many Years assign'd to his
            inferior Officer, the Master of the Revels; yet was not this License irrevocable; for
            several Plays, though acted by that Permission, had been silenced afterwards. The first
            Instance of this kind that common Fame has deliver'd down to us, is that of the <hi
              rend="italic">Maid's Tragedy</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Beaumont</hi> and <hi
              rend="italic">Fletcher,</hi> which was forbid in King <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi>
            the <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>'s time, by an Order from the Lord Chamberlain. For
            what Reason this Interdiction was laid upon it the Politicks of those Days have only
            left us to guess. Some said that the killing of the King in that Play, while the
            tragical Death of King <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi> the <hi rend="italic">First</hi>
            was then so fresh in People's Memory, was an Object too horribly impious for a publick
            Entertainment. What makes this Conjecture seem to have some Foundation, is that the
            celebrated <hi rend="italic">Waller,</hi> in Compliment to that Court, alter'd the last
            Act of this Play (which is printed at the End of his Works) and gave it a new
            Catastrophe, wherein the Life of the King is loyally saved, and the Lady's Matter made
            up with a less terrible Reparation. Others have given out, that a repenting Mistress, in
            a romantick Revenge of her Dishonour, killing the King in the very Bed he expected her
            to come into, was shewing a too dangerous Example to other <hi rend="italic"
            >Evadnes</hi> then shining at Court in the same Rank of royal Distinction; who, if ever
            their Consciences should have run equally mad, might have had frequent Opportunities of
            putting <pb n="13" entity="DSSR_000002933_0034"/> the Expiation of their Frailty into
            the like Execution. But this I doubt is too deep a Speculation, or too ludicrous a
            Reason, to be relied on; it being well known that the Ladies then in favour were not so
            nice in their Notions as to think their Preferment their Dishonour, or their Lover a
            Tyrant: Besides, that easy Monarch loved his Roses without Thorns; nor do we hear that
            he much chose to be himself the first Gatherer of them. <ref target="n13-1" n="9"

          <p>A Prologue (by <hi rend="italic">Dryden</hi>) to the <hi rend="italic">Prophetess</hi>

            some familiar, metaphorical Sneers at the Revolution itself; and as the Poetry of it was
            good, the Offence of it was less pardonable.</p>

            <ref target="n14-1" n="12">[14.1]</ref> had been offer'd to the Stage twenty Years
            before it was acted: But from the profound Penetration of the Master of the Revels, who
            saw political Spectres in it that never appear'd in the Presentation, it had lain so
            long upon the Hands of the Author; who had at last the good Fortune to prevail with a
            Nobleman to favour his Petition to Queen <hi rend="italic">Anne</hi> for Permission to
            have it acted: The Queen had the Goodness to refer the Merit of his Play to the Opinion
            of that noble Person, although he was not her Majesty's Lord Chamberlain; upon whose
            Report of its being every way an innocent Piece, it was soon after acted with Success.</p>
          <p>Reader, by your Leave&mdash;I will be just speak a Word or two to any Author that
            has not yet writ one Line of his next Play, and then I will come to my Point
            again&mdash;What I would say to him is this &mdash;Sir, before you set Pen to
            Paper, think well and principally of your Design or chief Action, towards <pb n="15"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0036"/> which every Line you write ought to be drawn, as to its
            Centre: If we can say of your finest Sentiments, This or That might be left out without
            maiming the Story, you would tell us, depend upon it, that fine thing is said in a wrong
            Place; and though you may urge that a bright Thought is not to be resisted, you will not
            be able to deny that those very fine Lines would be much finer if you could find a
            proper Occasion for them: Otherwise you will be thought to take less Advice from <hi
              rend="italic">Aristotle</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Horace</hi> than from Poet <hi
              rend="italic">Bays</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Rehearsal,</hi> who very smartly
              says&mdash;<hi rend="italic">What the Devil is the Plot good for but to bring in
              fine things?</hi> Compliment the Taste of your Hearers as much as you please with
            them, provided they belong to your Subject, but don't, like a dainty Preacher who has
            his Eye more upon this World than the next, leave your Text for them. When your Fable is
            good, every Part of it will cost you much less Labour to keep your Narration alive, than
            you will be forced to bestow upon those elegant Discourses that are not absolutely
            conducive to your Catastrophe or main Purpose: Scenes of that kind shew but at best the
            unprofitable or injudicious Spirit of a Genius. It is but a melancholy Commendation of a
            fine Thought to say, when we have heard it, <hi rend="italic">Well! but what's all this
              to the Purpose?</hi> Take, therefore, in some part, Example by the Author last
            mention'd! There are three Plays of his, the <hi rend="italic">Earl</hi> of <hi
              rend="italic">Essex,</hi>
            <ref target="n15-1" n="13">[15.1]</ref>
            <hi rend="italic">Anna <pb n="16" entity="DSSR_000002933_0037"/> Bullen,</hi>
            <ref target="n16-1" n="14">[16.1]</ref> and <hi rend="italic">Mary Queen of Scots,</hi>
            which, tho' they are all written in the most barren, barbarous Stile that was ever able
            to keep Possession of the Stage, have all interested the Hearts of his Auditors. To what
            then could this Success be owing, but to the intrinsick and naked Value of the
            well-conducted Tales he has simply told us? There is something so happy in the
            Disposition of all his Fables; all his chief Characters are thrown into such natural
            Circumstances of Distress, that their Misery or Affliction wants very little Assistance
            from the Ornaments of Stile or Words to speak them. When a skilful Actor is so situated,
            his bare plaintive Tone of Voice, the Cast of Sorrow from his Eye, his slowly graceful
            Gesture, his humble Sighs of Resignation under his Calamities: All these, I say, are
            sometimes without a Tongue equal to the strongest Eloquence. At such a time the
            attentive Auditor supplies from his own Heart whatever the Poet's Language may fall
            short of in Expression, and melts himself into every Pang of Humanity which the like
            Misfortunes in real Life could have inspir'd.</p>
          <p>After what I have observ'd, whenever I see a Tragedy defective in its Fable, let there
            be never so many fine Lines in it; I hope I shall be forgiven if I impute that Defect to
            the Idleness, the weak Judgment, or barren Invention of the Author.</p>
          <p>If I should be ask'd why I have not always my self follow'd the Rules I would impose
            upon others; <pb n="17" entity="DSSR_000002933_0038"/> I can only answer, that whenever
            I have not, I lie equally open to the same critical Censure. But having often observ'd a
            better than ordinary Stile thrown away upon the loose and wandering Scenes of an
            ill-chosen Story, I imagin'd these Observations might convince some future Author of how
            great Advantage a Fable well plann'd must be to a Man of any tolerable Genius.</p>
          <p>All this I own is leading my Reader out of the way; but if he has as much Time upon his
            Hands as I have, (provided we are neither of us tir'd) it may be equally to the Purpose
            what he reads or what I write of. But as I have no Objection to Method when it is not
            troublesome, I return to my Subject.</p>
          <p>Hitherto we have seen no very unreasonable Instance of this absolute Power of a Lord
            Chamberlain, though we were to admit that no one knew of any real Law, or Construction
            of Law, by which this Power was given him. I shall now offer some Facts relating to it
            of a more extraordinary Nature, which I leave my Reader to give a Name to.</p>
          <p>About the middle of King <hi rend="italic">William</hi>'s Reign an Order of the Lord
            Chamberlain was then subsisting that no Actor of either Company should presume to go
            from one to the other without a Discharge from their respective Menagers <ref
              target="n17-1" n="15">[17.1]</ref> and the Permission of <pb n="18"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0039"/> the Lord Chamberlain. Notwithstanding such Order, <hi
              rend="italic">Powel,</hi> being uneasy at the Favour <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> was
            then rising into, had without such Discharge left the <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi>
            Theatre and engag'd himself to that of <hi rend="italic">Lincolns-Inn-Fields:</hi> But
            by what follows it will appear that this Order was not so much intended to do both of
            them <hi rend="italic">good,</hi> as to do that which the Court chiefly favour'd (<hi
              rend="italic">Lincolns-Inn-Fields</hi>) no harm. <ref target="n18-1" n="16"
            >[18.1]</ref> For when <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi> grew dissatisfy'd at his Station
            there too, he return'd to <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi> (as he had before gone from
            it) without a Discharge: But halt a little! here, on this Side of the Question, the
            Order was to stand in force, and the same Offence against it now was not to be equally
            pass'd over. He was the next Day taken up by a Messenger and confin'd to the
            Porter's-Lodge, where, to the best of my Remembrance, he remain'd about two Days; when
            the Menagers of <hi rend="italic">Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</hi> not thinking an Actor of his
              <pb n="19" entity="DSSR_000002933_0040"/> loose Character worth their farther Trouble,
            gave him up; though perhaps he was releas'd for some better Reason. <ref target="n19-1"
              n="17">[19.1]</ref> Upon this occasion, the next Day, behind the Scenes at <hi
              rend="italic">Drury-Lane,</hi> a Person of great Quality in my hearing enquiring of
              <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi> into the Nature of his Offence, after he had heard it,
            told him, That if he had had Patience or Spirit enough to have staid in his Confinement
            till he had given him Notice of it, he would have found him a handsomer way of coming
            out of it.</p>
          <p>Another time the same Actor, <hi rend="italic">Powel,</hi> was provok'd <pb n="20"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0041"/> at <hi rend="italic">Will</hi>'s Coffee-house, in a
            Dispute about the Playhouse Affairs, to strike a Gentleman whose Family had been
            sometimes Masters of it; a Complaint of this Insolence was, in the Absence of the
            Lord-Chamberlain, immediately made to the Vice-Chamberlain, who so highly resented it
            that he thought himself bound in Honour to carry his Power of redressing it as far as it
            could possibly go: For <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi> having a Part in the Play that was
            acted the Day after, the Vice-Chamberlain sent an Order to silence the whole Company for
            having suffer'd <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi> to appear upon the Stage before he had made
            that Gentleman Satisfaction, although the Masters of the Theatre had had no Notice of
              <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi>'s Misbehaviour: However, this Order was obey'd, and
            remain'd in force for two or three Days, 'till the same Authority was pleas'd or advis'd
            to revoke it. <ref target="n20-1" n="18">[20.1]</ref> From the Measures this injur'd
            Gentleman took for his Redress, it may be judg'd how far it was taken for granted that a
            Lord-Chamberlain had an absolute Power over the Theatre.</p>
          <p>I shall now give an Instance of an Actor who had the Resolution to stand upon the
            Defence of his <pb n="21" entity="DSSR_000002933_0042"/> Liberty against the same
            Authority, and was reliev'd by it.</p>
          <p>In the same King's Reign, <hi rend="italic">Dogget,</hi> who tho', from a severe
            Exactness in his Nature, he could be seldom long easy in any Theatre, where
            Irregularity, not to say Injustice, too often prevail'd, yet in the private Conduct of
            his Affairs he was a prudent, honest Man. He therefore took an unusual Care, when he
            return'd to act under the Patent in <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane,</hi> to have his
            Articles drawn firm and binding: But having some Reason to think the Patentee had not
            dealt fairly with him, he quitted the Stage and would act no more, rather chusing to
            lose his whatever unsatisfy'd Demands than go through the chargeable and tedious Course
            of the Law to recover it. But the Patentee, who (from other People's Judgment) knew the
            Value of him, and who wanted, too, to have him sooner back than the Law could possibly
            bring him, thought the surer way would be to desire a shorter Redress from the Authority
            of the Lord-Chamberlain. <ref target="n21-1" n="19">[21.1]</ref> Accordingly, upon his
            Complaint a Messenger was immediately dispatch'd to <hi rend="italic">Norwich,</hi>
            where <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> then was to bring him up in Custody: but doughty <hi
              rend="italic">Dogget,</hi> who had Money in his Pocket and the Cause of Liberty at his
            Heart, was not in the least intimidated <pb n="22" entity="DSSR_000002933_0043"/> by
            this formidable Summons. He was observ'd to obey it with a particular Chearfulness,
            entertaining his Fellow-traveller, the Messenger, all the way in the Coach (for he had
            protested against Riding) with as much Humour as a Man of his Business might be capable
            of tasting. And as he found his Charges were to be defray'd, he, at every Inn, call'd
            for the best Dainties the Country could afford or a pretended weak Appetite could
            digest. At this rate they jollily roll'd on, more with the Air of a Jaunt than a
            Journey, or a Party of Pleasure than of a poor Devil in Durance. Upon his Arrival in
            Town he immediately apply'd to the Lord Chief Justice <hi rend="italic">Holt</hi> for
            his <hi rend="italic">Habeas Corpus.</hi> As his Case was something particular, that
            eminent and learned Minister of the Law took a particular Notice of it: For <hi
              rend="italic">Dogget</hi> was not only discharg'd, but the Process of his Confinement
            (according to common Fame) had a Censure pass'd upon it in Court, which I doubt I am not
            Lawyer enough to repeat! To conclude, the officious Agents of this Affair, finding that
            in <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> they had mistaken their Man, were mollify'd into milder
            Proceedings, and (as he afterwards told me) whisper'd something in his Ear that took
            away <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi>'s farther Uneasiness about it.</p>

          <p>By these Instances we see how naturally Power only founded on Custom is apt, where the
            Law is silent, to run into Excesses, and while it laudably pretends to govern others,
            how hard it is to govern itself. But since the Law has lately open'd its <pb n="23"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0044"/> Mouth, and has said plainly that some Part of this
            Power to govern the Theatre shall be, and is plac'd in a proper Person; and as it is
            evident that the Power of that white Staff, ever since it has been in the noble Hand
            that now holds it, has been us'd with the utmost Lenity, I would beg leave of the
            murmuring Multitude who frequent the Theatre to offer them a simple Question or two, <hi
              rend="italic">viz.</hi> Pray, Gentlemen, how came you, or rather your Fore-fathers,
            never to be mutinous upon any of the occasional Facts I have related? And why have you
            been so often tumultuous upon a Law's being made that only confirms a less Power than
            was formerly exercis'd without any Law to support it? You cannot, sure, say such
            Discontent is either just or natural, unless you allow it a Maxim in your Politicks that
            Power exercis'd <hi rend="italic">without</hi> Law is a less Grievance than the same
            Power exercis'd <hi rend="italic">according</hi> to Law!</p>
          <p>Having thus given the clearest View I was able of the usual Regard paid to the Power of
            a Lord-Chamberlain, the Reader will more easily conceive what Influence and Operation
            that Power must naturally have in all Theatrical Revolutions, and particularly in the
            complete Re-union of both Companies, which happen'd in the Year following.</p>

              from the fact that no Act of Parliament, previous to the 10 Geo. II., c. 28 (passed in

            <p> Bellchambers notes here that this order was superfluous, because the prohibition was

              not, I find from the Records of the Lord Chamberlain's Office that this order was
              frequently made. On 16th April, 1695, an edict was issued forbidding actors to desert
              from Betterton's company; on 25th July, 1695, desertions from either company were
              forbidden; and this latter order was reiterated on 27th May, 1697.</p>

            <p> I do not know whether it is merely a coincidence, but it is curious that, after
              Betterton got his License (on 25th March, 1695), an edict was issued that no one was
              to desert from his company to that of the Theatre Royal; while a general order against
              any desertion from either company to the other was not issued for more than three
              months after the first edict. The dates, as given in the Records of the Lord
              Chamberlain's Office, are 16th April and 25th July respectively. If this were
              intentional, it would form a curious commentary on Cibber's statement.</p>

            <seg type="note-symbol">[19.1]</seg>
            <p> Genest supposes that this incident occurred about June, 1704. But the Lord
              Chamberlain's Records of that time contain no note of it, and Cibber's language
              scarcely bears the interpretation that three years elapsed between Powell's leaving
              Drury Lane and returning to it, as was the case at that time; for he was at Lincoln's
              Inn Fields for three seasons, 1702 to 1704. I find, however, a warrant, dated 14th
              November, 1705, to apprehend Powell for refusing to act his part at the Haymarket, so
              that the audience had to be dismissed, and for trying to raise a mutiny in the
              company. He was ordered to be confined in the Porter's Lodge until further notice. On
              the 24th November Rich was informed that Powell had deserted the Haymarket, and was
              warned not to engage him. Now these desertions must have followed each other pretty
              closely, for he was at Drury Lane in the beginning of 1705; at the Haymarket in April
              of the same year; and about six months later had deserted the latter. The sequel to
              this difficulty seems to be the silencing of Rich for receiving Powell, on 5th March
              in the fifth year of Queen Anne's reign, that is, 1707. Unless the transcriber of the
              Records has made a mistake in the year, Powell was thus suspended for about eighteen
              months. It will be noticed that Cibber does not say that he was acting the night after
              his release, but merely that he was behind the scenes.</p>

              Davenant. The suspension was removed the following day; but on the 19th of the same
              month Powell was forbidden to be received at either Drury Lane or Dorset Garden.</p>

            candid Reader will have Patience to go through a full and fair Account of it: And yet I
            would fain flatter my self that those who are not too wise to frequent the Theatre (or
            have Wit enough to distinguish what sort of Sights there either to Honour or Disgrace to
            it) may think their national Diversion no contemptible Subject for a more able Historian
            than I pretend to be: If I have any particular Qualification for the Task more than
            another it is that I have been an ocular Witness of the several Facts that are to fill
            up the rest of my Volume, and am perhaps the only Person living (however unworthy) from
            whom the same Materials can be collected; but let them come from whom they may, whether
            at best they will be worth reading, perhaps a Judgment may be better form'd after a
            patient Perusal of the following Digression.</p>
          <p>In whatever cold Esteem the Stage may be among the Wise and Powerful, it is not so much
            a Reproach to those who contentedly enjoy it in its lowest Condition, as that Condition
            of it is to those who (though they cannot but know to how valuable a publick Use a
            Theatre, well establish'd, might be rais'd) yet in so many civiliz'd Nations have
            neglected it. This perhaps will be call'd thinking my own wiser than all the wise Heads

            than my Capacity has yet been able to dive into: If therefore my simple Opinion is a
            wrong one, let the Singularity of it expose me: And tho' I am only building a Theatre in
            the Air, it is there, however, at so little Expence and in so much better a Taste than
            any I have yet seen, that I cannot help saying of it, as a wiser Man did (it may be)

          <p>Give me leave to play with my Project in Fancy.</p>
          <p>I say, then, that as I allow nothing is more liable to debase and corrupt the Minds of
            a People than a licentious Theatre, so under a just and proper Establishment it were
            possible to make it as apparently the School of Manners and of Virtue. Were I to collect
            all the Arguments that might be given for my Opinion, or to inforce it by exemplary
            Proofs, it might swell this short Digression to a Volume; I shall therefore trust the
            Validity of what I have laid down to a single Fact that may be still fresh in the Memory
            of many living Spectators. When the Tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> was first
            acted, <ref target="n26-2" n="21">[26.2]</ref> let us call to mind the noble Spirit of
            Patriotism which that Play then infus'd into the Breasts of a free People that crowded
            to it; with what affecting Force was that most elevated of Human Virtues recommended?
            Even the false Pretenders to it felt an unwilling Conviction, <pb n="27"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0048"/> and made it a Point of Honour to be foremost in their
            Approbation; and this, too, at a time when the fermented Nation had their different
            Views of Government. Yet the sublime Sentiments of Liberty in that venerable Character
            rais'd in every sensible Hearer such conscious Admiration, such compell'd Assent to the
            Conduct of a Suffering Virtue, as even <hi rend="italic">demanded</hi> two almost
            irreconcileable Parties to embrace and join in their equal Applauses of it. <ref
              target="n27-1" n="22">[27.1]</ref> Now, not to take from the Merit of the Writer, had
            that Play never come to the Stage, how much of this valuable Effect of it must have been
            lost? It then could have had no more immediate weight with the Publick than our poring
            upon the many ancient Authors thro' whose Works the same Sentiments have been perhaps
            less profitably dispers'd, tho' amongst Millions of Readers; but by bringing such
            Sentiments to the Theatre and into Action, what a superior Lustre did they shine with?
            There <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> breath'd again in Life; and though he perish'd in the
            Cause of Liberty, his Virtue was victorious, and left the Triumph of it in the Heart of
            every melting Spectator. If Effects like these are laudable, if the Representation of
            such Plays can carry Conviction with so much Pleasure to the Understanding, have <pb
              n="28" entity="DSSR_000002933_0049"/> they not vastly the Advantage of any other Human
            Helps to Eloquence? What equal Method can be found to lead or stimulate the Mind to a
            quicker Sense of Truth and Virtue, or warm a People into the Love and Practice of such
            Principles as might be at once a Defence and Honour to their Country? In what Shape
            could we listen to Virtue with equal Delight or Appetite of Instruction? The Mind of Man
            is naturally free, and when he is compell'd or menac'd into any Opinion that he does not
            readily conceive, he is more apt to doubt the Truth of it than when his Capacity is led
            by Delight into Evidence and Reason. To preserve a Theatre in this Strength and Purity
            of Morals is, I grant, what the wisest Nations have not been able to perpetuate or to
            transmit long to their Posterity: But this Difficulty will rather heighten than take
            from the Honour of the Theatre: The greatest Empires have decay'd for want of proper
            Heads to guide them, and the Ruins of them sometimes have been the Subject of Theatres
            that could not be themselves exempt from as various Revolutions: Yet may not the most
            natural inference from all this be, That the Talents requisite to form good Actors,
            great Writers, and true Judges were, like those of wise and memorable Ministers, as well
            the Gifts of Fortune as of Nature, and not always to be found in all Climes or Ages. Or
            can there be a stronger modern Evidence of the Value of Dramatick Performances than that
            in many Countries where the Papal Religion prevails <pb n="29"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0050"/> the Holy Policy (though it allows not to an Actor
            Christian Burial) is so conscious of the Usefulness of his Art that it will frequently
            take in the Assistance of the Theatre to give even Sacred History, in a Tragedy, a
            Recommendation to the more pathetick Regard of their People. How can such Principles, in
            the Face of the World, refuse the Bones of a Wretch the lowest Benefit of Christian
            Charity after having admitted his Profession (for which they deprive him of that
            Charity) to serve the solemn Purposes of Religion? How far then is this Religious
            Inhumanity short of that famous Painter's, who, to make his <hi rend="italic"
            >Crucifix</hi> a Master-piece of Nature, stabb'd the Innocent Hireling from whose Body
            he drew it; and having heighten'd the holy Portrait with his last Agonies of Life, then
            sent it to be the consecrated Ornament of an Altar? Though we have only the Authority of
            common Fame for this Story, yet be it true or false the Comparison will still be just.
            Or let me ask another Question more humanly political.</p>
          <p>How came the <hi rend="italic">Athenians</hi> to lay out an Hundred Thousand Pounds
            upon the Decorations of one single Tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Sophocles?</hi>
            <ref target="n29-1" n="23">[29.1]</ref> Not, sure, as it was merely a Spectacle for
            Idleness or Vacancy of Thought to gape at, but because it was the most rational, most
            instructive and delightful Composition that Human Wit had yet arrived at, and
            consequently the most worthy to be the Entertainment of a wise and warlike Nation: And
            it may be still a Question whether <pb n="30" entity="DSSR_000002933_0051"/> the <hi
              rend="italic">Sophocles</hi> inspir'd this Publick Spirit, or this Publick Spirit
            inspir'd the <hi rend="italic">Sophocles?</hi>
            <ref target="n30-1" n="24">[30.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>But alas! as the Power of giving or receiving such Inspirations from either of these
            Causes seems pretty well at an End, now I have shot my Bolt I shall descend to talk more
            like a Man of the Age I live in: For, indeed, what is all this to a common <hi
              rend="italic">English</hi> Reader? Why, truly, as <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi>
            terms it&mdash; <hi rend="italic">Caviare to the Multitude!</hi>
            <ref target="n30-2" n="25">[30.2]</ref> Honest <hi rend="italic">John Trott</hi> will
            tell you, that if he were to believe what I have said of the <hi rend="italic"
            >Athenians</hi>, he is at most but astonish'd at it; but that if the twentieth Part of
            the Sum I have mentioned were to be apply'd out of the Publick money to the Setting off
            the best Tragedy the nicest Noddle in the Nation could produce, it would probably raise
            the Passions higher in those that did Not like it than in those that did; it might as
            likely meet with an Insurrection as the Applause of the People, and so, mayhap, be
            fitter for the Subject of a Tragedy than for a publick Fund to support it.
            &mdash;Truly, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Trott,</hi> I cannot but own that I am very much
            of your Opinion: I am only concerned that the Theatre has not a better Pretence to the
            Care and further Consideration of those Governments where it is tolerated; but as what I
            have said <pb n="31" entity="DSSR_000002933_0052"/> will not probably do it any great
            Harm, I hope I have not put you out of Patience by throwing a few good Wishes after an
            old Acquaintance.</p>
          <p>To conclude this Digression. If for the Support of the Stage what is generally shewn
            there must be lower'd to the Taste of common Spectators; or if it is inconsistent with
            Liberty to mend that Vulgar Taste by making the Multitude less merry there; or by
            abolishing every low and senseless Jollity in which the Understanding can have no Share;
            whenever, I say, such is the State of the Stage, it will be as often liable to
            unanswerable Censure and manifest Disgraces. Yet there <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a
            Time, not yet out of many People's Memory, when it subsisted upon its own rational
            Labours; when even Success attended an Attempt to reduce it to Decency; and when Actors
            themselves were hardy enough to hazard their Interest in pursuit of so dangerous a
            Reformation. And this Crisis I am my self as impatient as any tir'd Reader can be to
            arrive at. I shall therefore endeavour to lead him the shortest way to it. But as I am a
            little jealous of the badness of the Road, I must reserve to myself the Liberty of
            calling upon any Matter in my way, for a little Refreshment to whatever Company may have
            the Curiosity or Goodness to go along with me.</p>
          <p>When the sole Menaging Patentee at <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi> for several Years
            could never be persuaded or driven to any Account with the Adventurers, Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Thomas Skipwith</hi> (who, if I am rightly inform'd, had an equal <pb
              n="32" entity="DSSR_000002933_0053"/> Share with him <ref target="n32-1" n="26"
            >[32.1]</ref> ) grew so weary of the Affair that he actually made a Present of his
            entire Interest in it upon the following Occasion.</p>
          <p>Sir <hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi> happen'd in the Summer preceding the Re-union of the
            Companies to make a Visit to an intimate Friend of his, Colonel <hi rend="italic"
            >Brett,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Sandywell,</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
            >Gloucestershire</hi>; where the Plesantness of the Place, and the agreeable manner of
            passing his Time there, had raised him to such a Gallantry of Heart, that in return to
            the Civilities of his Friend the Colonel he made him an Offer of his whole Right in the
            Patent; but not to overrate the Value of his Present, told him he himself had made
            nothing of it these ten Years: But the Colonel (he said) being a greater Favourite of
            the People in Power, and (as he believ'd) among the Actors too, than himself was, might
            think of some Scheme to turn it to Advantage, and in that Light, if he lik'd it, it was
            at <pb n="33" entity="DSSR_000002933_0054"/> his Service. After a great deal of Raillery
            on both sides of what Sir <hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi> had <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
            made of it, and the particular Advantages the Colonel was likely to make of it, they
            came to a laughing Resolution That an Instrument should be drawn the next Morning of an
            Absolute Conveyance of the Premises. A Gentleman of the Law well known to them both
            happening to be a Guest there at the same time, the next Day produced the Deed according
            to his Instructions, In the Presence of whom and of others it was Sign'd, seal'd, and
            deliver'd to the Purposes therein contain'd. <ref target="n33-1" n="27">[33.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>This Transaction may be another Instance (as I have elsewhere observed) at how low a
            Value the Interests in a Theatrical License were then held, tho' it was visible from the
            Success of <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> in that very Year that with tolerable
            Menagement they could at no time have fail'd of being a profitable Purchase.</p>
          <p>The next Thing to be consider'd was what the Colonel should do with his new Theatrical
            Commission, which in another's Possession had been of so little Importance. Here it may
            be necessary to premise that this Gentleman was the first of any Consideration since my
            coming to the Stage with whom I had contracted a Personal Intimacy; which might be the
            Reason why in this Debate my Opinion had some Weight with him: Of this Intimacy, too, I
            am the more tempted to talk from the natural Pleasure <pb n="34"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0055"/> of calling back in Age the Pursuits and happy Ardours
            of Youth long past, which, like the Ideas of a delightful Spring in a Winter's
            Rumination, are sometimes equal to the former Enjoyment of them. I shall, therefore,
            rather chuse in this Place to gratify my self than my Reader, by setting the fairest
            Side of this Gentleman in view, and by indulging a little conscious Vanity in shewing
            how early in Life I fell into the Possession of so agreeable a Companion: Whatever
            failings he might have to others, he had none to me; nor was he, where he had them,
            without his valuable Qualities to balance or soften them. Let, then, what was not to be
            commended in him rest with his Ashes, never to be rak'd into: But the friendly Favours I
            received from him while living give me still a Pleasure in paying this only Mite of my
            Acknowledgment in my Power to his Memory. And if my taking this Liberty may find Pardon
            from several of his fair Relations still living, for whom I profess the utmost Respect,
            it will give me but little Concern tho' my critical Reader should think it all
            Impertinence.</p>
          <p>This Gentleman, then, <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi>, was the eldest Son of <hi
              rend="italic">Henry Brett,</hi> Esq; of <hi rend="italic">Cowley,</hi> in <hi
              rend="italic">Gloucestershire,</hi> who coming early to his Estate of about Two
            Thousand a Year, by the usual Negligences of young Heirs had, before this his eldest Son
            came of age, sunk it to about half that Value, and that not wholly free from
            Incumbrances. Mr. <hi rend="italic">Brett</hi>, whom I am speaking of, had his
            Education, and I might say, <pb n="35" entity="DSSR_000002933_0056"/> ended it, at the
            University of <hi rend="italic">Oxford</hi>; for tho' he was settled some time after at
            the <hi rend="italic">Temple,</hi> he so little followed the Law there that his Neglect
            of it made the Lay (like some of his fair and frail Admirers) very often follow <hi
              rend="italic">him.</hi> As he had an uncommon Share of Social Wit and a handsom
            Person, with a sanguine Bloom in his Complexion, no wonder they persuaded him that he
            might have a better Chance of Fortune by throwing such Accomplishments into the gayer
            World than by shutting them up in a Study. The first View that fires the Head of a young
            Gentleman of this modish Ambition just broke loose from Business, is to cut a Figure (as
            they call it) in a Side-box at the Play, from whence their next Step is to the <hi
              rend="italic">Green Room</hi> behind the Scenes, sometimes their <hi rend="italic">Non
              ultra.</hi> Hither at last, then, in this hopeful Quest of his Fortune, came this
            Gentleman-Errant, not doubting but the fickle Dame, while he was thus qualified to
            receive her, might be tempted to fall into his Lap. And though possibly the Charms of
            our Theatrical Nymphs might have their Share in drawing him thither, yet in my
            Observation the most visible Cause of his first coming was a more sincere Passion he had
            conceived for a fair full-bottom'd Perriwig which I then wore in my first Play of the
              <hi rend="italic">Fool in Fashion</hi> in the Year 1695. <ref target="n35-1" n="28"
              >[35.1]</ref> For it is to be noted that the <hi rend="italic">Beaux</hi> of those
            Days were of a quite different Cast from the modern Stamp, and had <pb n="36"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0057"/> more of the Stateliness of the Peacock in their Mien
            than (which now seems to be their highest Emulation) the pert Air of a Lapwing. Now,
            whatever Contempt Philosophers may have for a fine Perriwig, my Friend, who was not to
            despise the World, but to live in it, knew very well that so material an Article of
            Dress upon the Head of a Man of Sense, if it became him, could never fail of drawing to
            him a more partial Regard and Benevolence than could possibly be hoped for in an
            ill-made one. <ref target="n36-1" n="29">[36.1]</ref> This perhaps may soften the grave
            Censure which so youthful a Purchase might otherwise have laid upon him: In a Word, he
            made his Attack upon this Perriwig, as your young Fellows generally do upon a Lady of
            Pleasure, first by a few familiar Praises of her Person, and then a civil Enquiry into
            the Price of it. But upon his observing me a little surprized at the Levity of his
            Question about a Fop's Perriwig, he began to railly himself with so much Wit and Humour
            upon the Folly of his Fondness for it, that he struck me with an equal Desire of
            granting any thing in my <pb n="37" entity="DSSR_000002933_0058"/> Power to oblige so
            facetious a Customer. This singular Beginning of our Conversation, and the mutual Laughs
            that ensued upon it, ended in an Agreement to finish our Bargain that Night over a
            Bottle.</p>
          <p>If it were possible the Relation of the happy Indiscretions which passed between us
            that Night could give the tenth Part of the Pleasure I then received from them, I could
            still repeat them with Delight: But as it may be doubtful whether the Patience of a
            Reader may be quite so strong as the Vanity of an Author, I shall cut it short by only
            saying that single Bottle was the Sire of many a jolly Dozen that for some Years
            following, like orderly Children, whenever they were call'd for, came into the same
            Company. Nor, indeed, did I think from that time, whenever he was to be had, any Evening
            could be agreeably enjoy'd without him. <ref target="n37-1" n="30">[37.1]</ref> But the
            long continuance of our Intimacy perhaps may be thus accounted for.</p>
          <p>He who can taste Wit in another may in some sort be said to have it himself: Now, as I
            always <pb n="38" entity="DSSR_000002933_0059"/> had, and (I bless my self for the
            Folly) still have a quick Relish of whatever did or can give me Delight: This Gentleman
            could not but see the youthful Joy I was generally raised to whenever I had the
            Happiness of a <hi rend="italic">T&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te</hi> with
            him; and it may be a moot Point whether Wit is not as often inspired by a proper
            Attention as by the brightest Reply to it. Therefore, as he had Wit enough for any two
            People, and I had Attention enough for any four, there could not well be wanting a
            sociable Delight on either side. And tho' it may be true that a Man of a handsome Person
            is apt to draw a partial Ear to every thing he says; yet this Gentleman seldom said any
            thing that might not have made a Man of the plainest Person agreeable. Such a continual
            Desire to please, it may be imagined, could not but sometimes lead him into a little
            venial Flattery rather than not succeed in it. And I, perhaps, might be one of those
            Flies that was caught in this Honey. As I was then a young successful Author and an
            Actor in some unexpected Favour, whether deservedly or not imports not; yet such
            Appearances at least were plausible Pretences enough for an amicable Adulation to
            enlarge upon, and the Sallies of it a less Vanity than mine might not have been able to
            resist. Whatever this Weakness on my side might be, I was not alone in it; for I have
            heard a Gentleman of Condition say, who knew the World as well as most Men that live in
            it, that let his Discretion be ever so much upon its Guard, he never fell into Mr. <hi
              rend="italic">Brett</hi>'s <pb n="39" entity="DSSR_000002933_0060"/> Company without
            being loth to leave it or carrying away a better Opinion of himself from it. If his
            Conversation had this Effect among the Men; what must we suppose to have been the
            Consequence when he gave it a yet softer turn among the Fair Sex? Here, now, a <hi
              rend="italic">French</hi> Novellist would tell you fifty pretty Lies of him; but as I
            chuse to be tender of Secrets of that sort, I shall only borrow the good Breeding of
            that Language, and tell you in a Word, that I knew several Instances of his being <hi
              rend="italic">un Homme &agrave; bonne Fortune.</hi> But though his frequent
            Successes might generally keep him from the usual Disquiets of a Lover, he knew this was
            a Life too liquorish to last; and therefore had Reflexion enough to be govern'd by the
            Advice of his Friends to turn these his Advantages of Nature to a better use.</p>
          <p>Among the many Men of Condition with whom his Conversation had recommended him to an
            Intimacy, Sir <hi rend="italic">Thomas Skipwith</hi> had taken a particular Inclination
            to him; and as he had the Advancement of his Fortune at Heart, introduced him where
            there was a Lady <ref target="n39-1" n="31">[39.1]</ref> who had enough in her Power to
            disencumber him of the World and make him every way easy for Life.</p>
          <p>While he was in pursuit of this Affair, which no time was to be lost in (for the Lady
            was to be in <pb n="40" entity="DSSR_000002933_0061"/> Town but for three Weeks) I one
            Day found him idling behind the Scenes before the Play was begun. Upon sight of him I
            took the usual Freedom he allow'd me, to rate him roundly for the Madness of not
            improving every Moment in his Power in what was of such consequence to him. Why are you
            not (said I) where you know you only should be? If your design should once get Wind in
            the Town, the Ill-will of your Enemies of the Sincerity of the Lady's Friends may soon
            blow up your Hopes, which in your Circumstances of Life cannot be long supported by the
            bare Appearance of a Gentleman. &mdash;But it is impossible to proceed without some
            Apology for the very familiar Circumstance that is to follow&mdash;Yet, as it might
            not be so trivial in its Effect as I fear it may be in the Narration, and is a Mark of
            that Intimacy which is necessary should be known had been between us, I will honestly
            make bold with my Scruples and let the plain Truth of my Story take its Chance for
            Contempt or Approbation.</p>
          <p>After twenty Excuses to clear himself of the Neglect I had so warmly charged him with,
            he concluded them with telling me he had been out all the Morning upon Business, and
            that his Linnen was too much soil'd to be seen in Company. O, ho! said I, is that all?
            Come along with me, we will soon get over that dainty Difficulty: Upon which I haul'd
            him by the Sleeve into my Shifting-Room, he either staring, laughing, or hanging back
            all the way. There, when I had lock'd him in, I began to strip off <pb n="41"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0062"/> my upper Cloaths, and bad him do the same; still her
            either did not, or would not seem to understand me, and continuing his Laugh, cry'd,
            What! is the Puppy mad? No, no, only positive, said I; for look you, in short, the Play
            is ready to begin, and the Parts that you and I are to act to Day are not of equal
            consequence; mine of young <hi rend="italic">Reveller</hi> (in <hi rend="italic"
              >Greenwich-Park</hi>
            <ref target="n41-1" n="32">[41.1]</ref> ) is but a Rake; but whatever you may be, you
            are not to appear so; therefore take my Shirt and give me yours; for depend upon't, stay
            here you shall not, and so go about your Business. To conclude, we fairly chang'd
            Linnen, nor could his Mother's have wrap'd him up more fortunately; for in about ten
            Days he marry'd the Lady. <ref target="n41-2" n="33">[41.2]</ref> In a Year or Two after
            his Marriage he was chosen a Member of that Parliament which was sitting when <pb n="42"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0063"/> King <hi rend="italic">William</hi> dy'd. And, upon
            raising of some new Regiments, was made Lieutenant-Colonel to that of Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Charles Hotham.</hi> But as his Ambition extended not beyond the Bounds
            of a Park Wall and a pleasant Retreat in the Corner of it, which with too much Expence
            he had just finish'd, he, within another Year, had leave to resign his Company to a
            younger Brother.</p>
          <p>This was the Figure in Life he mad when Sir <hi rend="italic">Thomas Skipwith</hi>
            thought him the most proper Person to oblige (if it could be an Obligation) with the
            Present of his Interest in the Patent. And from these Anecdotes of my Intimacy with him,
            it may be less a Surprise, when he came to Town invested with this new Theatrical Power,
            that I should be the first Person to whom he took any Notice of it. And notwithstanding
            he knew I was then engag'd, in another Interest, at the <hi rend="italic"
            >Hay-Market</hi>, he desired we might consider together of the best Use he could make of
            it, assuring me at the same time he should think it of none to himself unless it could
            in some Shape be turn'd to my Advantage. This friendly Declaration, though it might be
            generous in him to make, was not needful to incline me in whatever might be honestly in
            my Power, whether by Interest or Negotiation, to serve him. My first Advice, <pb n="43"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0064"/> therefore, was, That he should produce his Deed to the
            other Menaging Patentee of <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi>, and demand immediate
            Entrance to a joint Possession of all Effects and Powers to which that Deed had given
            him an equal Title. After which, if he met with no Opposition to this Demand (as upon
            sight of it he did not) that he should be watchful against any Contradiction from his
            Collegue in whatever he might propose in carrying on the Affair, but to let him see that
            he was determin'd in all his Measures. Yet to heighten that Resolution with an Ease and
            Temper in his manner, as if he took it for granted there could be no Opposition made to
            whatever he had in mind to. For that this Method, added to his natural Talent of
            Persuading, would imperceptibly lead his Collegue into a Reliance on his superior
            Understanding, That however little he car'd for Business he should give himself the Air
            at least of Enquiry into what <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been done, that what he
            intended to do might be thought more considerable and be the readier comply'd with: For
            if he once suffer'd his Collegue to seem wiser than himself, there would be no end of
            his perplexing him with absurd and dilatory Measures; direct and plain Dealing being a
            Quality his natural Diffidence would never suffer him to be Master of; of which his not
            complying with his Verbal Agreement with <hi rend="italic">Swiney,</hi> when the <hi
              rend="italic">Hay-Market</hi> House was taken for both their Uses, was an Evidence.
            And though some People thought it Depth and Policy in him to keep things often in <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0065"/> Confusion, it was every my Opinion they over-rated his
            Skill, and that, in reality, his Parts were too weak for his Post, in which he had
            always acted to the best of his Knowledge. That his late Collegue, Sir <hi rend="italic"
              >Thomas Shipwith,</hi> had trusted too much to his Capacity for this sort of Business,
            and was treated by him accordingly, without ever receiving any Profits from it for
            several Years: Insomuch that when he found his Interest in such desperate Hands he
            thought the best thing he could do with it was (as he saw) to give it away. Therefore if
            he (Mr. <hi rend="italic">Brett</hi>) could once fix himself, as I had advis'd, upon a
            different Foot with this hitherto untractable Menager, the Business would soon run
            through whatever Channel he might have a mind to lead it. And though I allow'd the
            greatest Difficulty he would meet with would be in getting his Consent to a Union of the
            two Companies, which was the only Scheme that could raise the Patent to its former
            Value, and which I knew this close Menager would secretly lay all possible Rubs in the
            way to; yet it was visible there was a way of reducing him to Compliance: For though it
            was true his Caution would never part with a Straw by way of Concession, yet to a high
            Hand he would give up any thing, provided he were suffer'd to keep his Title to it: If
            his Hat were taken from his Head in the Street, he would make no farther Resistance than
            to say, <hi rend="italic">I am not willing to part with it.</hi> Much less would he have
            the Resolution openly to oppose any just <pb n="45" entity="DSSR_000002933_0066"/>
            Measures, when he should find one, who with an equal Right to his and with a known
            Interest to bring them about, was resolv'd to go thro' with them.</p>
          <p>Now though I knew my Friend was as thoroughly acquainted with this Patentee's Temper as
            myself, yet I thought it not amiss to quicken and support his Resolution, by confirming
            to him the little Trouble he would meet with, in pursuit of the Union I had advis'd him
            to; for it must be known that on our side Trouble was a sort of Physick we did not much
            care to take: But as the Fatigue of this Affair was likely to be lower'd by a good deal
            of Entertainment and Humour, which would naturally engage him in his dealing with so
            exotick a Partner, I knew that this softening the Business into a Diversion would lessen
            every Difficulty that lay in our way to it.</p>
          <p>However copiously I may have indulg'd my self in this Commemoration of a Gentleman with
            whom I had pass'd so many of my younger Days with Pleasure, yet the Reader may by this
            Insight into his Character, and by that of the other Patentee, be better able to judge
            of the secret Springs that gave Motion to or obstructed so considerable an Event as that
            of the Re-union of the two Companies of Actors in 1708. <ref target="n45-1" n="34"
              >[45.1]</ref> In Histories of more weight, for want of such Particulars we are often

            Appearances of Wisdom, what perhaps in reality was the mere Effect of Chance or Humour.</p>
          <p>Immediately after Mr. <hi rend="italic">Brett</hi> was admitted as a joint Patentee, he
            made use of the Intimacy he had with the Vice-Chamberlain to assist his Scheme of this
            intended Union, in which he so far prevail'd that it was soon after left to the
            particular Care of the same Vice-Chamberlain to give him all the Aid and Power necessary
            to the bringing what he desired to Perfection. The Scheme was, to have but one Theatre
            for Plays and another for Operas, under separate Interests. And this the generality of
            Spectators, as well as the most approv'd Actors, had been some time calling for as the
            only Expedient to recover the Credit of the Stage and the valuable Interests of its
            Menagers.</p>
          <p>As the Condition of the Comedians at this time is taken notice of in my <hi
              rend="italic">Dedication</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Wife's Resentment</hi> to the
            Marquis (now Duke) of <hi rend="italic">Kent</hi>, and then Lord-Chamberlain, which was
            publish'd above thirty Years ago, <ref target="n46-1" n="35">[46.1]</ref> when I had no
            thought of ever troubling the World with this Theatrical History, I see no Reason why it
            may not pass as a Voucher of the Facts I am now speaking of; I shall therefore give them
            in the very Light I then saw them. After some Acknowledgment for his Lordship's
            Protection of our (<hi rend="italic">Hay-Market</hi>) Theatre, it is further
            said&mdash;</p>
          <p>"The Stage has, for many Years, 'till of late, <pb n="47" entity="DSSR_000002933_0068"
            /> "groan'd under the greatest Discouragements, which "have been very much, if not
            wholly, owing to the "Mismenagement of those that have aukwardly "govern'd it. Great
            Sums have been ventur'd upon "empty Projects and Hopes of immoderate Gains, "and when
            those Hopes have fail'd, the Loss has "been tyrannically deducted out of the Actors
            "Sallary. And if your Lordship had not redeem'd "them&mdash;<hi rend="italic">This
              is meant of our being suffer'd to come</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">"over to</hi> Swiney&mdash;they were very near being "wholly laid
            aside, or, at least, the Use of their "Labour was to be swallow'd up in the pretended
            "Merit of Singing and Dancing."</p>
          <p>What follows relates to the Difficulties in dealing with the then impracticable
            Menager, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi></p>
          <p>"&mdash;And though your Lordship's Tenderness of "oppressing is so very just that
            you have rather "staid to convince a Man of your good Intentions "to him than to do him
            even a Service against his "Will; yet since your Lordship has so happily begun "the
            Establishment of the separate Diversions, we "live in hope that the same Justice and
            Resolution "will still persuade you to go as successfully through "with it. But while
            any Man is suffer'd to confound "the Industry and Use of them by acting publickly "in
            opposition to your Lordship's equal Intentions, "under a false and intricate Pretence of
            not being "able to comply with then, the Town is likely to "be more entertain'd with the
            private Dissensions "than the publick Performance of either, and the <pb n="48"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0069"/> "Actors in a perpetual Fear and Necessity of
            "petitioning your Lordship every Season for new "Relief."</p>
          <p>Such was the State of the Stage immediately preceding the time of Mr. <hi rend="italic"
              >Brett</hi>'s being admitted a joint Patentee, who, as he saw with clearer Eyes what
            was its evident Interest, left no proper Measures unattempted to make this so long
            despair'd-of Union practicable. The most apparent Difficulty to be got over in this
            Affair was, what could be done for <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> in consideration of his
            being oblig'd to give up those Actors whom the Power and Choice of the Lord-Chamberlain
            had the Year before set him at the Head of, and by whose Menagement those Actors had
            found themselves in a prosperous Condition. But an Accident at this time happily
            contributed to make that Matter easy. The Inclination of our People of Quality for
            foreign Operas had now reach'd the Ears of <hi rend="italic">Italy,</hi> and the Credit
            of their Taste had drawn over from thence, without any more particular Invitation, one
            of their capital Singers, the famous Signior <hi rend="italic">Cavaliero Nicolini:</hi>
            From whose Arrival, and the Impatience of the Town to hear him, it was concluded that
            Operas being now so completely provided could not fail of Success, and that by making
              <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> sole Director of them the Profits must be an ample
            Compensation for his Resignation of the Actors. This Matter being thus adjust by <hi
              rend="italic">Swiney</hi>'s Acceptance of the Opera only to be perform'd at the <hi
              rend="italic">Hay-Market</hi> House, the <pb n="49" entity="DSSR_000002933_0070"/>
            Actors were all order'd to return to <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane,</hi> there to remain

            <p> Malone supposes that Skipwith acquired his shares from the Killigrew family, but in
              the indenture by which he transferred his interest to Brett, it seems as if he had
              acquired part of it from Alexander Davenant, and the remainder by buying up shares of
              the original Adventurers. The indenture will be found at length in Mr. Percy
              Fitzgerald's "New History of the English Stage," i. 252. Skipwith is described in the
              "Biog. Dram." (i. 487) as "a weak, vain, conceited coxcomb." The proportion in which
              the shares were divided among the various holders is shown by the "Opinion" of Northey
              and Raymond, in 1711, to have been this: Three-twentieths belonged to Charles
              Killigrew. The remainder was divided into tenths, of which two-tenths belonged to
              Rich; the other eight parts were owned by the Mortgagees or Adventurers. If Cibber's
              supposition is correct, two of these parts belonged to Shipwith.</p>

              long time, covered with large full-bottomed perriwigs, a fashion introduced in the
              reign of Charles II., which was not entirely disused in public till about the year
              1720. Addison, Congreve, and Steele, met a Button's coffee-house, in large, flowing,
              flaxen wigs; Booth, Wilks, and Cibber, when full-dressed, wore the same. Till within
              these twenty-five years, our Tamerlanes and Catos had as much hair on their heads as

              to have returned it to him saying, "Sir, it will not do." Going to Button's, he
              related his exploit with great glee, but was rebuked in the strongest terms by Colonel
              Brett, who is said to have put him to shame before the whole company. This is related
              as having occurred many years after the time Cibber now writes of; the suggestion

            <p> This was the Countess of Macclesfield, the supposed mother of Richard Savage, who

              married Brett. She lived to be eighty, or over it, dying 11th October, 1753.</p>

            <p> In Boswell's Life of Johnson (i. 174) there is a note by Boswell himself:&mdash;</p>
            <q>"Miss Mason, after having forfeited the title of Lady Macclesfield by divorce, was
              married to Colonel Brett, and, it is said, was well known in all the polite circles.
              Colley Cibber, I am informed, had so high an opinion of her taste and judgement as to
              genteel life, and manners, that he submitted every scene of his <hi rend="italic"
                >Careless Husband</hi> to Mrs. Brett's revisal and correction. Colonel Brett was
              reported to be too free in his gallantry with his Lady's maid. Mrs. Brett came into a
              room one day in her own house, and found the Colonel and her maid both fast asleep in
              two chairs. She tied a white handkerchief round her husband's neck, which was a
              sufficient proof that she had discovered his intrigue; but she never at any time took
              notice of it to him. This incident, as I am told, gave occasion to the well-wrought
              scene of Sir Charles and Lady Easy and Edging."</q>

            a Plant of our Native Growth, nor what our plainer Appetites are fond of, and is of so
            delicate a Nature that without excessive Charge it cannot live long among us; especially
            while the nicest <hi rend="italic">Connoisseurs</hi> in Musick fall into such various
            Heresies in Taste, every Sect pretending to be the true one: Yet, as it is call'd a

            our Domestick Theatre, a short View of its Progress may be allow'd a Place in our
            History.</p>
          <p>After this new Regulation the first Opera that appear'd was <hi rend="italic"
            >Pyrrhus.</hi> Subscriptions at that time were not extended, as of late, to the whole
            Season, but were limited to the first Six Days only of a new Opera. The chief Performers
            in this were <hi rend="italic">Nicolini, Valentini,</hi> and Mrs. <hi rend="italic"
              >Tofts</hi>; <ref target="n51-1" n="38">[51.1]</ref> and for the inferior Parts the
            best that were then to be found. Whatever Praises may have been given to the most famous
            Voices that have been heard since <hi rend="italic">Nicolini,</hi> upon the whole I
            cannot but come into the Opinion that still prevails among several Persons of Condition
            who are able to give a Reason for their liking, that no Singer since his Time has so
            justly and gracefully <pb n="52" entity="DSSR_000002933_0073"/> acquitted himself in
            whatever Character he appear'd as <hi rend="italic">Nicolini.</hi> At most the
            Difference between him and the greatest Favourite of the Ladies, <hi rend="italic"
              >Farinelli,</hi> amounted but to this, that he might sometimes more exquisitely
            surprize us, but <hi rend="italic">Nicolini</hi> (by pleasing the Eye as well as the
            Ear) fill'd us with a more various and <hi rend="italic">rational</hi> Delight. Whether
            in this Excellence he has since had any Competitor, perhaps will be better judg'd by
            what the Critical Censor of <hi rend="italic">Great Britain</hi> says of him in his
            115th <hi rend="italic">Tatler, viz.</hi></p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">"Nicolini</hi> sets off the Character he bears in an "Opera by his

            half the Sum that has since been given to several that could never totally surpass him:
            The Consequence of which is, that the Losses by Operas, for several Seasons, to the End
            of the Year 1738, have been so great, that those Gentlemen of Quality who last undertook
            the Direction of them, found it ridiculous any longer to entertain the Publick at so
            extravagant <pb n="54" entity="DSSR_000002933_0075"/> an Expence, while no one

          <p>Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Tofts</hi>, <ref target="n54-1" n="40">[54.1]</ref> who took her

            find in her manner, she had, in the general Sense of her Spectators, Charms that few of
            the most learned Singers ever arrive at. The Beauty of her fine proportion'd Figure, and
            exquisitely sweet, silver Tone of her Voice, with that peculiar, rapid Swiftness of her
            Throat, were Perfections not <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0076"/>

            <ref target="n55-1" n="42">[55.1]</ref> yet, as he had the Advantage of giving us our
            first Impression of a good Opera Singer, he had still his Admirers, and was of great
            Service in being so skilful a Second to his Superior.</p>
          <p>Three such excellent Performers in the same kind of Entertainment at once, <hi
              rend="italic">England</hi> till this Time had never seen: Without any farther
            Comparison, then, with the much dearer bought who have succeeded them, their Novelty at
            least was a Charm that drew vast Audiences of the fine World after them. <hi
              rend="italic">Swiney,</hi> their sole Director, was prosperous, and in one Winter a
            Gainer by them of a moderate younger Brother's Fortune. But as Musick, by so profuse a
            Dispensation of her Beauties, could not always supply our dainty Appetites with equal
            Variety, nor for ever please us with the same Objects, the Opera, after one luxurious
            Season, like the fine Wife of a roving Husband, began to loose its Charms, and every Day
            discover'd to our Satiety Imperfections which our former Fondness has been blind to: But
            of this I shall observe <pb n="56" entity="DSSR_000002933_0081"/> more in its Place: in
            the mean time, let us enquire into the Productions of our native Theatre.</p>
          <p>It may easily be conceiv'd, that by this entire Reunion of the two Companies Plays must
            generally have been perform'd to a more than usual Advantage and Exactness: For now
            every chief Actor, according to his particular Capacity, piqued himself upon rectifying
            those Errors which during their divided State were almost unavoidable. Such a Choice of
            Actors added a Richness to every good Play as it was then serv'd up to the publick
            Entertainment: The common People crowded to them with a more joyous Expectation, and
            those of the higher Taste return'd to them as to old Acquaintances, with new Desires
            after a long Absence. In a Word, all Parties seem'd better pleas'd but he who one might
            imagine had most Reason to be so, the (lately) sole menaging Patentee. He, indeed, saw
            his Power daily mould'ring from his own Hands into those of Mr. <hi rend="italic">Brett,</hi>
            <ref target="n56-1" n="43">[56.1]</ref> whose <pb n="57" entity="DSSR_000002933_0082"/>
            Gentlemanly manner of making every one's Business easy to him, threw their old Master
            under a Disregard which he had not been us'd to, nor could with all his happy Change of
            Affairs support. Although this grave Theatrical Minister of whom I have been oblig'd to
            make such frequent mention, had acquired the Reputation of a most profound Politician by
            being often incomprehensible, yet I am not sure that his Conduct at this Juncture gave
            us not an evident Proof that he was, like other frail Mortals, more a Slave to his
            Passions than his Interest; for no Creature ever seem'd more fond of Power that so
            little knew how to use it to his Profit and Reputation; otherwise he could not possibly
            have been so discontented, in his secure and prosperous State of the Theatre, as to
            resolve at all Hazards to destroy it. We shall now see what infallible Measures he took
            to bring this laudable Scheme to Perfection.</p>
          <p>He plainly saw that, as this disagreeable Prosperity was chiefly owing to the Conduct
            of Mr. <hi rend="italic">Brett</hi>, there could be no hope of recovering the State to
            its former Confusion but by finding some effectual Means to make Mr. <hi rend="italic"
              >Brett</hi> weary of his Charge: The most probable he could for the Present think of,
            in this Distress, was to call in the Adventurers (whom for many Years, by his Defence in
            Law, he had kept out) now to take care of their visibly improving Interests. <ref
              target="n57-1" n="44">[57.1]</ref> This fair Appearance of Equity being <pb n="58"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0083"/> known to be his own Proposal, he rightly guess'd would
            incline these Adventurers to form a Majority of Votes on his Side in all Theatrical
            Questions, and consequently become a Check upon the Power of Mr. <hi rend="italic"
              >Brett,</hi> who had so visibly alienated the Hearts of his Theatrical Subjects, and
            now began to govern without him. When the Adventurers, therefore, were re-admitted to
            their old Government, after having recommended himself to them by proposing to make some
            small Dividend of the Profits (though he did not design that Jest should be repeated) he
            took care that the Creditors of the Patent, who were then no inconsiderable Body, should
            carry off the every Weeks clear Profits in proportion to their several Dues and Demands.
            This Conduct, so speciously just, he had Hopes would let Mr. <hi rend="italic"
            >Brett</hi> see that his Share in the Patent was not so valuable an Acquisition as
            perhaps he might think it; and probably make a Man of his Turn to Pleasure soon weary of
            the little Profit and great Plague it gave him. Now, though these might be all notable
            Expedients, yet I <pb n="59" entity="DSSR_000002933_0084"/> cannot say they would have
            wholly contributed to Mr. <hi rend="italic">Brett</hi>'s quitting his Post, had not a
            Matter of much stronger Moment, an unexpected Dispute between him and Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Thomas Skipwith,</hi> prevailed with him to lay it down: For int he
            midst of this flourishing State of the Patent, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Brett</hi> was
            surpriz'd with a Subp&oelig;na into Chancery from Sir <hi rend="italic">Thomas
              Skipwith,</hi> who alledg'd in his Bill that the Conveyance he had made of his
            Interest in the Patent to Mr. <hi rend="italic">Brett</hi> was only intended in Trust.
            (Whatever the Intent might be, the Deed it self, which I then read, made no mention of
            any Trust whatever.) But whether Mr. <hi rend="italic">Brett</hi>, as Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Thomas</hi> farther asserted, had previously, or after the Deed was
            sign'd, given his Word of Honour that if he should ever make the Stage turn to any
            Account or Profit, he would certainly restore it: That, indeed, I can say nothing to;
            but be the Deed valid or void, the Facts that apparently follow'd were, that tho' Mr.
              <hi rend="italic">Brett</hi> in his Answer to this Bill absolutely deny'd his
            receiving this Assignment either in Trust or upon any limited Condition of what kind
            soever, yet he made no farther Defence in the Cause. But since he found Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Thomas</hi> had thought fit on any Account to sue for the Restitution of
            it, and Mr. <hi rend="italic">Brett</hi> being himself conscious that, as the World knew
            he had paid no Consideration for it, his keeping it might be misconstrued, or not
            favourably spoken of; or perhaps finding, tho's the Profits were great, they were
            constantly swallowed up (as has been observ'd) by the previous Satisfaction <pb n="60"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0085"/> of old Debts, he grew so tir'd of the Plague and
            Trouble the whole Affair had given him, and was likely still to engage him in, that in a
            few Weeks after he withdrew himself from all Concern with the Theatre, and quietly left
            Sir <hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi> to find his better Account in it. And thus stood this
            undecided Right till, upon the Demise of Sir <hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi>, Mr. <hi
              rend="italic">Brett</hi> being allow'd the Charges he had been at in this Attendance
            and Prosecution of the Union, reconvey'd this Share of the Patent to Sir <hi
              rend="italic">George Skipwith,</hi> the Son and Heir of Sir <hi rend="italic"
            >Thomas</hi>. <ref target="n60-1" n="45">[60.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>Our Politician, the old Patentee, having thus fortunately got rid of Mr. <hi
              rend="italic">Brett</hi>, who had so rashly brought the Patent once more to be a
            profitable Tenure, was now again at Liberty to chuse rather to lose all than not to have
            it all to himself.</p>
          <p>I have elsewhere observ'd that nothing can so effectually secure the Strength, or
            contribute to the Prosperity of a good Company, as the Directors of it having always, as
            near as possible, an amicable Understanding with three or four of their best Actors,
            whose good or ill-will must naturally make a wide Difference in their profitable or
            useless manner of serving them: While the Principal are kept reasonably easy the lower
            Class can never be troublesome without hurting themselves: But when a valuable Actor is
            hardly treated, the Master must be a very <pb n="61" entity="DSSR_000002933_0086"/>
            cunning Man that finds his Account in it. We shall now see how far Experience will
            verify this Observation.</p>
          <p>The Patentees thinking themselves secure in being restor'd to their former absolute
            Power over this now only Company, chose rather to govern it by the Reverse of the Method
            I have recommended: For tho' the daily Charge of their united Company amounted not, by a
            good deal, to what either of the two Companies now in <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi>
            or <hi rend="italic">Covent-Garden</hi> singly arises, they notwithstanding fell into
            their former Politicks of thinking every Shilling taken from a hired Actor so much clear
            Gain to the Proprietor: Many of their People, therefore, were actually, if not
            injudiciously, reduced in their Pay, and others given to understand the same Fate was
            design'd them; of which last Number I my self was one; which occurs to my Memory by the
            Answer I made to one of the Adventurers, who, in Justification of their intended
            Proceeding, <ref target="n61-1" n="46">[61.1]</ref> told me that my Sallary, tho' it
            should be less than it was by ten Shillings a Week, would still be more than ever <hi
              rend="italic">Goodman</hi> had, who was abetter Actor than I could pretend to be: To
            which I reply'd, This may be true, but then you know, Sir, it is as true that <hi
              rend="italic">Goodman</hi> was forced to go upon the High-way for <pb n="62"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0087"/> a Livelihood. As this was a known Fact of <hi
              rend="italic">Goodman,</hi> my mentioning it on that Occasion I believe was of Service
            to me; at least my Sallary was not reduced after it. To say a Word or two more of <hi
              rend="italic">Goodman,</hi> so celebrated an Actor in his Time, perhaps may set the
            Conduct of the Patentees in a clearer Light. Tho' <hi rend="italic">Goodman</hi> had
            left the Stage before I came to it, I had some slight Acquaintance with him. About the
            Time of his being expected to be an Evidence against Sir <hi rend="italic">John
            Fenwick</hi> in the Assassination-Plot, <ref target="n62-1" n="47">[62.1]</ref> in 1696,
            I happen'd to meet him at Dinner at Sir <hi rend="italic">Thomas Skipwith</hi>'s who, as
            he was an agreeable Companion himself, liked <hi rend="italic">Goodman</hi> for the same
            Quality. Here it was that <hi rend="italic">Goodman,</hi> without <pb n="63"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0088"/> Disguise or sparing himself, fell into a laughing
            Account of several loose Passages of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> younger Life; as his
            being expell'd the University of <hi rend="italic">Cambridge</hi> for being one of the
            hot-headed Sparks who were concern'd in the cutting and defacing the Duke of <hi
              rend="italic">Monmouth</hi>'s Picture, then Chancellor of that Place. But this
            Disgrace, it seems, had not disqualified him for the Stage, which, like the Sea-Service,
            refuses no Man for his Morals that is able-bodied: There, as an Actor, he soon grew into
            a different Reputation; but whatever his Merit might be, the Pay of a hired Hero in
            those Days was so very low that he was forced, it seems, to take the Air (as he call'd
            it) and borrow what Money the first Man he met had about him. But this being his first
            Exploit of that kind which the Scantiness of his Theatrical Fortune had reduced him to,
            King <hi rend="italic">James</hi> was prevail'd upon to pardon him: Which <hi
              rend="italic">Goodman</hi> said was doing him so particular an Honour that no Man
            could wonder if his Acknowledgment had carried him a little farther than ordinary into
            the Interest of that Prince: But as he had lately been out of Luck in backing his old
            Master, he had now no way to get home the Life he was out upon his Account but by being
            under the same Obligations to King <hi rend="italic">William.</hi></p>
          <p>Another Anecdote of him, though not quite so dishonourably enterprizing, which I had
            from his own Mouth at a different Time, will equally shew to what low Shifts in Life the
            poor Provision for good <pb n="64" entity="DSSR_000002933_0089"/> Actors, under the
            early Government of the Patent, reduced them. In the younger Days of their Heroism,
            Captain <hi rend="italic">Griffin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Goodman</hi> were confined
            by their moderate Sallaries to the Oeconomy of lying together in the same Bed and having
            but one whole Shirt between them: One of them being under the Obligation of a Rendezvous
            with a fair Lady, insisted upon his wearing it out of his Turn, which occasion'd so high
            a Dispute that the Combat was immediately demanded, and accordingly their Pretensions to
            it were decided by a fair Tilt upon the Spot, in the Room where they lay: But whether
              <hi rend="italic">Clytus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Alexander</hi> was obliged to see
            no Company till a worse could be wash'd for him, seems not to be a material Point in
            their History, or to my Purpose. <ref target="n64-1" n="48">[64.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>By this Rate of <hi rend="italic">Goodman,</hi> who, 'till the Time of his quitting the
            Stage never had more than what is call'd forty Shillings a Week, it may be judg'd how
            cheap the Labour of Actors had been formerly; and the Patentees thought it a Folly to
            continue the higher Price, (which their Divisions had since raised them to) now there
            was but one Market for them; but alas! they had forgot their former fatal Mistake of
            squabbling with their Actors in 1695; <ref target="n64-2" n="49">[64.2]</ref> nor did
              <pb n="65" entity="DSSR_000002933_0090"/> they make any Allowance for the Changes and
            Operations of Time, or enough consider the Interest the Actors had in the Lord
            Chamberlain, on whose Protection they might always rely, and whose Decrees had been less
            restrain'd by Precedent than those of a Lord Chancellor.</p>
          <p>In this mistaken View of their Interest, the Patentees, by treating their Actors as
            Enemies, really made them so: And when once the Masters of a hired Company think not
            their Actors Hearts as necessary as their Hands, they cannot be said to have agreed for
            above half the Work they are able to do in a Day: Or, if an unexpected Success should,
            notwithstanding, make the Profits in any gross Disproportion greater than the Wages, the
            Wages will always have something worse than a Murmur at the Head of them, that will not
            only measure the Merit of the Actor by the Gains of the Proprietor, but will never
            naturally be quiet till every Scheme of getting into Property has been tried to make the
            Servant his own Master: And this, as far as Experience can make me judge, will always be
            in either of these Cases the State of our <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Theatre. What
            Truth there may be in this Observation we are now coming to a Proof of.</p>
          <p>To enumerate all the particular Acts of Power in which the Patentees daily bore hard
            upon <hi rend="italic">this</hi> now only Company of Actors, might be as tedious as
            unnecessary; I shall therefore come at once to their most material Grievance, upon which
            they grounded <pb n="66" entity="DSSR_000002933_0091"/> their Complaint to the Lord
            Chamberlain, who, in the Year following, 1709, took effectual Measures for their Relief.</p>
          <p>The Patentees observing that the Benefit-Plays of the Actors towards the latter End of
            the Season brought the most crowded Audiences in the Year, began to think their own
            Interests too much neglected by these partial Favours of the Town to their Actors; and
            therefore judg'd it would not be impolitick in such wholesome annual Profits to have a
            Fellow-feeling with them. Accordingly an <hi rend="italic">Indulto</hi>
            <ref target="n66-1" n="50">[66.1]</ref> was laid of one Third out of the Profits of
            every Benefit for the proper Use and Behoof of the Patent. <ref target="n66-2" n="51"
              >[66.2]</ref> But that a clear Judgment may be form'd of the Equity or Hardship of
            this Imposition, it will be necessary to shew from whence and from what Causes the
            Actors Claim to Benefits originally proceeded.</p>

          <pb n="67" entity="DSSR_000002933_0092"/>
          <p>During the Reign of King <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi> an Actor's Benefit had never
            been heard of. The first Indulgence of this kind was given to Mrs. <hi rend="italic"
              >Barry</hi> (as has been formerly observed <ref target="n67-1" n="52">[67.1]</ref> )
            in King <hi rend="italic">James</hi>'s Time, in Consideration of the extraordinary
            Applause that had followed her Performance: But there this Favour rested to her alone,
            'till after the Division of the only Company in 1695, at which time the Patentees were
            soon reduced to pay their Actors half in good Words and half in ready Money. In this
            precarious Condition some particular Actors (however binding their Agreements might be)
            were too poor or too wise to go to Law with a Lawyer, and therefore rather chose to
            compound their Arrears for their being admitted to the Chance of having them made up by
            the Profits of a Benefit-Play. This Expedient had this Consequence; that the Patentees,
            tho' their daily Audiences might, and did sometimes mend, still kept the short
            Subsistance of their Actors at a stand, and grew more steady in their Resolution so to
            keep them, and as they found them less apt to mutiny while their Hopes of being clear'd
            off by a Benefit were depending. In a Year or two these Benefits grew so advantageous
            that they became at last the chief Article in every Actor's Agreement.</p>
          <p>Now though the Agreements of these united Actors I am speaking of in 1708 were as yet
            only Verbal, yet that made no difference in the honest Obligation to keep them: But as
            Honour at that <pb n="68" entity="DSSR_000002933_0093"/> time happen'd to have but a
            loose hold of their Consciences, the Patentees rather chose to give it the slip, and
            went on with their Work without it. No Actor, therefore, could have his Benefit fix'd
            'till he had first sign'd a Paper signifying his voluntary Acceptance of it upon the
            above Conditions, any Claims from Custom to the contrary notwithstanding. Several at
            first refus'd to sign this Paper; upon which the next in Rank were offer'd on the same
            Conditions to come before the Refusers; this smart Expedient got some few of the Fearful
            the Preference to their Seniors; who, at last, seeing the Time was too short for a
            present Remedy, and that they must either come into the Boat or lose their Tide, were
            forc'd to comply with what they as yet silently resented as the severest Injury. In this
            Situation, therefore, they chose to let the principal Benefits be over, that their
            Grievances might swell into some bulk before they made any Application for Redress to
            the Lord-Chamberlain; who, upon hearing their general Complaint, order'd the Patentees
            to shew cause why their Benefits had been diminish'd one Third, contrary to the common
            Usage? The Patentees pleaded the sign'd Agreement, and the Actors Receipts of the other
            two Thirds, in Full Satisfaction. But these were prov'd to have been exacted from them
            by the Methods already mentioned. They notwithstanding insist upon them as lawful. But
            as Law and Equity to not always agree, they were look'd upon as unjust and arbitrary.
            Whereupon <pb n="69" entity="DSSR_000002933_0094"/> the Patentees were warn'd at their
            Peril to refuse the Actors full Satisfaction. <ref target="n69-1" n="53">[69.1]</ref>
            But here it was thought necessary that Judgment should be for some time respited, 'till
            the Actors, who had leave so to do, could form a Body strong enough to make the
            Inclination of the Lord-Chamberlain to relieve them practicable.</p>
          <p>Accordingly <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> (who was then sole Director of the Opera
            only) had Permission to enter into a private Treaty with such of the united Actors in
              <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi> as might be thought fit to head a Company under
            their own Menagement, and to be Sharers with him in the <hi rend="italic"
            >Hay-Market.</hi> The Actors chosen for this Charge were <hi rend="italic">Wilks,
              Dogget,</hi> Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi>, and Myself. But before I proceed,
            lest it should seem surprizing that neither <hi rend="italic">Betterton,</hi> Mrs. <hi
              rend="italic">Barry,</hi> Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Bracegirdle,</hi> or <hi
              rend="italic">Booth</hi> were Parties in this Treaty, it must be observ'd that <hi
              rend="italic">Betterton</hi> was now Seventy-three, and rather chose, with the
            Infirmities of Age upon him, than to involve himself in the Cares and Hurry that must
            unavoidably attend the Regulation of a new Company. As to the two celebrated Actresses I
            have named, this has been my first proper Occasion of making it known that they had both
            quitted the Stage the Year before this <pb n="70" entity="DSSR_000002933_0095"/>
            Transaction was thought of. <ref target="n70-1" n="54">[70.1]</ref> And <hi
              rend="italic">Booth</hi> as yet was scarce out of his Minority as an Actor, or only in
            the Promise of that Reputation which, in about four or five Years after, he happily
            arriv'd at. However, at this Juncture he was not so far overlook'd as not to be offer'd
            a valuable Addition to his Sallary: But this he declin'd, being, while the Patentees
            were under this Distress, as much, if not more, in favour with their chief Menager as a
            Schematist than as an Actor: And indeed he appear'd, to my Judgment, more inclin'd to
            risque his Fortune in <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane,</hi> where he should have no Rival
            in Parts or Power, than on any Terms to embark in the <hi rend="italic">Hay-Market,</hi>
            where he was sure to meet with Opponents in both. <ref target="n70-2" n="55"
            >[70.2]</ref> However, this his Separation from our Interest when our All was at stake,
            afterwards kept his Advancement to a Share with us in our more successful Days longer
            postpon'd than otherwise it probably might have been.</p>
          <p>When Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi> was nominated as a joint Sharer in our new
            Agreement to be made with <hi rend="italic">Swiney, Dogget,</hi> who had no Objection to
            her Merit, insisted that our Affairs could never be upon a secure Foundation if there
            was more than one Sex admitted to <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0096"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0097"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0098"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0099"/>
            <pb n="71" entity="DSSR_000002933_0100"/> the Menagement of them. He therefore hop'd
            that if we offer'd Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi> a <hi rend="italic">Carte
              Blanche</hi> instead of a Share, she would not think herself slighted. This was
            instantly agreed to, and Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi> receiv'd it rather as a
            Favour than a Disobligation: Her Demands therefore were Two Hundred Pounds a Year
            certain, and a Benefit clear of all Charges, which were readily sign'd to. Her Easiness
            on this Occasion, some Years after, when our Establishment was in Prosperity, made us
            with less Reluctancy advance her Two Hundred Pounds to Three Hundred Guineas <hi
              rend="italic">per Annum,</hi> with her usual Benefit, which, upon an Average, for
            several Years at least doubled that Sum.</p>
          <p>When a sufficient number of Actors were engag'd under our Confederacy with <hi
              rend="italic">Swiney</hi>, it was then judg'd a proper time for the Lord-Chamberlain's
            Power to operate, which, by lying above a Month dormant, had so far recover'd the
            Patentees from any Apprehensions of what might fall upon them from their late
            Usurpations on the Benefits of the Actors, that they began to set their Marks upon those
            who had distinguish'd themselves in the Application for Redress. Several little
            Disgraces were put upon them, particularly in the Disposal of Parts in Plays to be
            reviv'd, and as visible a Partiality was shewn in the Promotion of those in their
            Interest, though their Endeavours to serve them could be of no extraordinary use. How
            often does History shew us, in the same State of Courts, the same Politicks have been
            practis'd? All this while the other Party were <pb n="72" entity="DSSR_000002933_0101"/>
            passively silent, 'till one Day the Actor who particularly solicited their Cause at the
            Lord-Chamberlain's Office, being shewn there the Order sign'd for absolutely silencing
            the Patentees, and ready to be serv'd, flew back with the News to his Companions, then
            at a Rehearsal in which he had been wanted; when being call'd to his Part, and something
            hastily question'd by the Patentee for his Neglect of Business: This Actor, I say, with
            an erected Look and a Theatrical Spirit, at once threw off the Mask and roundly told
              him&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Sir, I have now no more Business Here than you have;
              in half an Hour you will neither have Actors to command nor Authority to employ
            them.</hi>&mdash;The Patentee, who though he could not readily comprehend his
            mysterious manner of Speaking, had just a Glimpse of Terror enough from the Words to
            soften his Reproof into a cold formal Declaration, That <hi rend="italic">if he would
              not do his Work he should not be paid.</hi>&mdash;But now, to complete the
            Catastrophe of these Theatrical Commotions, enters the Messenger with the Order of
            Silence in his Hand, whom the same Actor officiously introduc'd, telling the Patentee
            that the Gentleman wanted to speak with him from the Lord-Chamberlain. When the
            Messenger had delivered the Order, the Actor, throwing his Head over his Shoulder
            towards the Patentee, in the manner of <hi rend="italic">Shakespear's Harry the
            Eighth</hi> to Cardinal <hi rend="italic">Wolsey,</hi> cry'd&mdash;<hi rend="italic"
              >Read o'er that! and now&mdash; to Breakfast, with what Appetite you may.</hi>
            Tho' these Words might be spoken in too vindictive and <pb n="73"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0102"/> insulting a manner to be commended, yet, from the
            Fulness of a Heart injuriously treated and now reliev'd by that instant Occasion, why
            might they not be pardon'd? <ref target="n73-1" n="56">[73.1]</ref>
          </p>


          <p>The Authority of the Patent now no longer subsisting, all the confederated Actors
            immediately walked out of the House, to which they never return'd 'till they became
            themselves the Tenants and Masters of it.</p>
          <pb n="74" entity="DSSR_000002933_0103"/>
          <p>Here agen we see an higher Instance of the Authority of a Lord-Chamberlain than any of
            those I have elsewhere mentioned: From whence that Power might be deriv'd, as I have
            already said, I am not Lawyer enough to know; however, it is evident that a Lawyer
            obey'd it, though to his Cost; which might incline one to think that the Law was not
            clearly against it: Be that as it may, since the Law has lately made it no longer a
            Question, let us drop the Enquiry and proceed to the Facts which follow'd this Order
            that silenc'd the Patent.</p>
          <p>From this last injudicious Disagreement of the Patentees with their principal Actors,
            and from what they had suffered on the same Occasion in the Division of their only
            Company in 1695, might we not imagine there was something of Infatuation in their
            Menagement? For though I allow Actors in general, when they are too much indulg'd, or
            govern'd by an unsteady Head, to be as unruly a Multitude as Power can be plagued with;
            yet there is a Medium which, if cautiously observed by a candid use of Power, making
            them always know, without feeling, their Superior, neither suffering their Encroachments
            nor invading their Rights, with an immoveable Adherence to the accepted Laws they are to
            walk by; such a Regulation, I say, has never fail'd, in my Observation, to have made
            them a tractable and profitable Society. If the Government of a well-establish'd Theatre
            were to be compar'd to that of a Nation, there is no one Act of Policy or Misconduct in
            the <pb n="75" entity="DSSR_000002933_0104"/> one or the other in which the Menager
            might not, in some parallel Case, (laugh, if you please) be equally applauded or
            condemned with the Statesman. Perhaps this will not be found so wild a Conceit if you
            look into the 193d <hi rend="italic">Tatler,</hi> Vol. 4. where the Affairs of the State
            and those of the very Stage which I am now treating of, are, in a Letter from <hi
              rend="italic">Downs</hi> the Promptor, <ref target="n75-1" n="57">[75.1]</ref>
            compar'd, and with a great deal of Wit <pb n="76" entity="DSSR_000002933_0105"/> and
            Humour, set upon an equal Foot of Policy. The Letter is suppos'd to have been written in
            the last Change of the Ministry in Queen <hi rend="italic">Anne</hi>'s Time. I will
            therefore venture, upon the Authority of that Author's Imagination, to carry the
            Comparison as high as it can possibly go, and say, That as I remember one of our Princes
            in the last Century to have lost his Crown by too arbitrary a Use of his Power, though
            he knew how fatal the same Measures had been to his unhappy Father before him, why
            should we wonder that the same Passions taking Possession of Men in lower Life, by an
            equally impolitick Usage of their Theatrical Subjects, should have involved the
            Patentees in proportionable Calamities.</p>

          <pb n="77" entity="DSSR_000002933_0106"/>
          <p>During the Vacation, which immediately follow'd the Silence of the Patent, both Parties
            were at leisure to form their Schemes for the Winter: For the Patentee would still hold
            out, notwithstanding his being so miserably maim'd or over-match'd: He had no more
            Regard to Blows than a blind Cock of the Game; he might be beaten, but would never
            yield; the Patent was still in his Possession, and the Broad-Seal to it visibly as fresh
            as ever: Besides, he had yet some actors in his Service, <ref target="n77-1" n="58"
              >[77.1]</ref> at a much cheaper <pb n="78" entity="DSSR_000002933_0107"/> Rate than
            those who had left him, the Sallaries of which last, now they would not work for him, he
            was not oblig'd to pay. <ref target="n78-1" n="59">[78.1]</ref> In this way of thinking,
            he still kept together such as had not been invited over to the <hi rend="italic"
              >Hay-Market,</hi> or had been influenc'd by <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> to follow his
            Fortune in <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane.</hi></p>
          <p>By the Patentee's keeping these Remains of his broken Forces together, it is plain that
            he imagin'd this Order of Silence, like others of the same Kind, would be recall'd, of
            course, after a reasonable time of Obedience had been paid to it: But, it seems, he had
            rely'd too much upon former Precedents; nor had his Politicks yet div'd into the Secret
            that the Court Power, with which the Patent had been so long and often at variance, had
            now a mind to take the publick Diversions more absolutely into their own Hands: Not that
            I have any stronger Reasons for this Conjecture than that the Patent never after this
            Order of Silence got leave to play during the Queen's Reign. But upon the Accession of
            his late Majesty, Power having then a different Aspect, the Patent found no Difficulty
            in being permitted to exercise its <pb n="79" entity="DSSR_000002933_0108"/> former
            Authority for acting Plays, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> which, however, from this
            time of their lying still, in 1709, did not happen 'till 1714, which the old Patentee
            never liv'd to see: For he dy'd about six weeks before the new-built Theatre in <hi
              rend="italic">Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</hi> was open'd, <ref target="n79-1" n="60"
            >[79.1]</ref> where the first Play acted was the <hi rend="italic">Recruiting
            Officer,</hi> under the Menagement of his Heirs and Successors. But of that Theatre it
            is not yet time to give any further Account.</p>
          <p>The first Point resolv'd on by the Comedians now re-established in the <hi
              rend="italic">Hay-Market,</hi>
            <ref target="n79-2" n="61">[79.2]</ref> was to alter the <pb n="80"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0109"/> Auditory Part of their Theatre, the Inconveniencies of
            which have been fully enlarged upon in a former Chapter. What embarrass'd them most in
            this Design, was their want of Time to do it in a more complete manner than it now
            remains in, otherwise they had brought it to the original Model of that in <pb n="81"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0110"/>
            <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi>, only in a larger Proportion, as the wider Walls of it
            would require; as there are not many Spectators who may remember what Form the <hi
              rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi> Theatre stood in about forty Years ago, before the old
            Patentee, to make it hold more Money, took it in his Head to alter it, it were but
            Justice to <pb n="82" entity="DSSR_000002933_0111"/> lay the original Figure which Sir
              <hi rend="italic">Christopher Wren</hi> first gave it, and the Alterations of it now
            standing, in a fair Light; that equal Spectators may see, if they were at their choice,
            which of the Structures would incline them to a Preference. But in this <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0112"/> Appeal I only speak to such Spectators as allow a good
            Play well acted to be the most valuable Entertainment of the Stage. Whether such Plays
            (leaving <pb n="84" entity="DSSR_000002933_0113"/> the Skill of the dead or living
            Actors equally out of the Question) have been more or less recommended in their
            Presentation by either of these different Forms of that Theatre, is our present Matter
            of Enquiry.</p>
          <p>It must be observ'd, then, <ref target="n84-1" n="62">[84.1]</ref> that the Area or
            Platform <pb n="85" entity="DSSR_000002933_0114"/> of the old Stage projected about four
            Foot forwarder, in a Semi-oval Figure, parallel to the Benches of the Pit; and that the
            former lower Doors of Entrance for the Actors were brought down between the two foremost
            (and then only) Pilasters; in the Place of which Doors now the two Stage-Boxes are fixt.
            That where the Doors of Entrance now are, there formerly stood two additional
            Side-Wings, in front to a full Set of Scenes, which had then almost a double Effect in
            their Loftiness and Magnificence.</p>
          <p>By this Original Form, the usual Station of the Actors, in almost every Scene, was
            advanc'd at least ten Foot nearer to the Audience than they now can be; because, not
            only from the Stage's being shorten'd in front, but likewise from the additional
            Interposition of those Stage-Boxes, the Actors (in respect to the Spectators that fill
            them) are kept so much more backward from the main Audience than they us'd to be: But
            when the Actors were in Possession of that forwarder Space to advance upon, the Voice
            was then more in the Centre of the House, so that the most distant Ear had scarce the
            least Doubt or Difficulty in hearing what fell from the weakest Utterance: All Objects
            were thus drawn nearer to the Sense; every painted Scene was stronger; every grand Scene
            and Dance more extended; every rich or fine-coloured Habit had a more lively Lustre: Nor
            was the minutest Motion of a Feature (properly changing with the Passion or Humour it
            suited) ever lost, as they frequently must be in the Obscurity of <pb n="86"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0115"/> too great a Distance: And how valuable an Advantage the
            Facility of hearing distinctly is to every well-acted Scene, every common Spectator is a
            Judge. A Voice scarce raised above the Tone of a Whisper, either in Tenderness,
            Resignation, innocent Distress, or Jealousy suppress'd, often have as much concern with
            the Heart as the most clamorous Passions; and when on any of these Occasions such
            affecting Speeches are plainly heard, or lost, how wide is the Difference from the great
            or little Satisfaction received from them? To all this a Master of a Company may say, I
            now receive Ten Pounds more than could have been taken formerly in every full House! Not
            unlikely. But might not his House be oftener full if the Auditors were oftener pleas'd?
            Might not every bad House too, by a Possibility of being made every Day better, add as
            much to one Side of his Account as it could take from the other? If what I have said
            carries any Truth in it, why might not the original Form of this Theatre be restor'd?
            but let this Digression avail what it may, the Actors now return'd to the <hi
              rend="italic">Hay-Market,</hi> as I have observ'd, wanting nothing but length of Time
            to have govern'd their Alteration of that Theatre by this original Model of <hi
              rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi> which I have recommended. As their time therefore was
            short, they made their best use of it; they did something to it: They contracted its
            Wideness by three Ranges of Boxes on each side, and brought down its enormous high
            Ceiling within so proportionable a <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0116"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0117"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0118"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0119"/>
            <pb n="87" entity="DSSR_000002933_0120"/> Compass that it effectually cur'd those hollow
            Undulations of the Voice formerly complain'd of. The Remedy had its Effect; their
            Audiences exceeded their Expectation. There was now no other Theatre open against them;
              <ref target="n87-1" n="63">[87.1]</ref> they had the Town to themselves; they were
            their own Masters, and the Profits of their Industry came into their own Pockets.</p>
          <p>Yet with all this fair Weather, the Season of their uninterrupted Prosperity was not
            yet arriv'd; for the great Expence and thinner Audiences of the Opera (of which they
            then were equally Directors) was a constant Drawback upon their Gains, yet not so far
            but that their Income this Year was better than in their late Station at <hi
              rend="italic">Drury-Lane.</hi> But by the short Experience we had then had of Operas;
            by the high Reputation they seem'd to have been arriv'd at the Year before; by their
            Power of drawing the whole Body of Nobility as by Enchantment to their Solemnities; by
            that Prodigality of Expence at which they were so willing to support them; and from the
            late extraordinary Profits <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> had made of them, what
            Mountains did we not hope from this Molehill? But alas! the fairy Vision was vanish'd;
            this bridal Beauty was grown familiar to the general Taste, and Satiety began to make
            Excuses for its want of Appetite: Or, what is still stranger, its <pb n="88"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0121"/> late Admirers now as much valued their Judgment in
            being able to find out the Faults of the Performers, as they had before in discovering
            their Excellencies. The Truth is, that this kind of Entertainment being so entirely
            sensual, it had no Possibility of getting the better of our Reason but by its Novelty;
            and that Novelty could never be supported but by an annual Change of the best Voices,
            which, like the finest Flowers, bloom but for a Season, and when that is over are only
            dead Nose-gays. From this Natural Cause we have seen within these two Years even <hi
              rend="italic">Farinelli</hi> singing to an Audience of five and thirty Pounds, and
            yet, if common Fame may be credited, the same Voice, so neglected in one Century, has in
            another had Charms sufficient to make that Crown sit easy on the Head of a Monarch,
            which the Jealousy of Politicians (who had their Views in his keeping it) fear'd,
            without some such extraordinary Amusement, his Satiety of Empire might tempt him a
            second time to resign. <ref target="n88-1" n="64">[88.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>There is, too, in the very Species of an <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> Singer such an
            innate, fantastical Pride and Caprice, that the Government of them (here at least) is
            almost impracticable. <pb n="89" entity="DSSR_000002933_0122"/> This Distemper, as we
            were not sufficiently warn'd or apprized of, threw our musical Affairs into Perplexities
            we knew not easily how to get out of. There is scarce a sensible Auditor in the Kingdom
            that has not since that Time had Occasion to laugh at the several Instances of it: But
            what is still more ridiculous, these costly Canary-Birds have sometimes infested the
            whole Body of our dignified Lovers of Musick with the same childish Animosities: Ladies
            have been known to decline their Visits upon account of their being of a different
            musical Party. <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pompey</hi>
            made not a warmer Division in the <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi> Republick than those
            Heroines, their Country Women, the <hi rend="italic">Faustina</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
              >Cuzzoni</hi>, blew up in our Common-wealth of Academical Musick by their implacable
            Pretensions to Superiority. <ref target="n89-1" n="65">[89.1]</ref> And while this
            Greatness of Soul is their unalterable Virtue, it will never be practicable to make two
            capital Singers of the same Sex do as they should do in one Opera at the same time! no,
            not tho' <hi rend="italic">England</hi> were to double the Sums it has already thrown
            after them: For even in their own <pb n="90" entity="DSSR_000002933_0123"/> Country,
            where an extraordinary Occasion has called a greater Number of their best to sing
            together, the Mischief they have made has been proportionable; an Instance of which, I
            am rightly inform'd, happen'd at <hi rend="italic">Parma</hi>, where, upon the
            Celebration of the Marriage of that Duke, a Collection was made of the most eminent
            Voices that Expence or Interest could purchase, to give as complete an Opera as the
            whole vocal Power of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> could form. But when it came to the
            Proof of this musical Project, behold! what woful Work they made of it! every Performer
            would be a <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi> or Nothing; their several Pretensions
            to Preference were not to be limited within the Laws of Harmony; they could all choose
            their own Songs, but not more to set off themselves than to oppose or deprive another of
            an Occasion to shine: Yet any one would sing a bad Song, provided no body else had a
            good one, till at last they were thrown together, like so many feather'd Warriors, for a
            Battle-royal in a Cock-pit, where every one was oblig'd to kill another to save himself!
            What Pity it was these froward Misses and Masters of Musick had not been engag'd to
            entertain the Court of some King of <hi rend="italic">Morocco,</hi> that could have
            known a good Opera from a bad one! with how much Ease would such a Director have brought
            them to better Order? But alas! as it has been said of greater Things, <hi rend="italic"
              >Suis et ipsa Roma viribus ruit.</hi> Hor. <ref target="n90-1" n="66">[90.1]</ref>
            <pb n="91" entity="DSSR_000002933_0124"/> Imperial <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi> fell by
            the too great Strength of its own Citizens! So fell this mighty Opera, ruin'd by the too
            great Excellency of its Singers! For, upon the whole, it proved to be as barbarously bad
            as if Malice it self had composed it.</p>
          <p>Now though something of this kind, equally provoking, has generally embarrass'd the
            State of Operas these thirty Years, yet it has the Misfortune of the menaging Actors at
            the <hi rend="italic">Hay-Market</hi> to have felt the first Effects of it: The Honour
            of the Singer and the Interest of the Undertaker were so often at Variance, that the
            latter began to have but a bad Bargain of it. But not to impute more to the Caprice of
            those Performers than was really true, there were two different Accidents that drew
            Numbers from our Audiences before the Season was ended; which were another Company
            permitted to act in <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane,</hi>
            <ref target="n91-1" n="67">[91.1]</ref> and the long Trial of Doctor <hi rend="italic"
              >Sacheverel</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Westminster-Hall:</hi>
            <ref target="n91-2" n="68">[91.2]</ref> By the way, it must be observed that this
            Company was not under the Director of the Patent (which continued still silenced) but
            was set up by a third Interest, with a License from Court. The Person to whom this new
            License was granted was <hi rend="italic">William Collier,</hi> Esq., <pb n="92"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0125"/> a Lawyer of an enterprizing Head and a jovial Heart;
            what sort of Favour he was in with the People then in Power may be judg'd from his being
            often admitted to partake with them those detach'd Hours of Life when Business was to
            give way to Pleasure: But this was not all his Merit, he was at the same time a Member
            of Parliament for <hi rend="italic">Truro</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Cornwall,</hi> and
            we cannot suppose a Person so qualified could be refused such a Trifle as a License to
            head a broken Company of Actors. This sagacious Lawyer, then, who had a Lawyer to deal
            with, observing that his Antagonist kept Possession of a Theatre without making use of
            it, and for which he was not obliged to pay Rent unless he actually <hi rend="italic"
              >did</hi> use it, wisely conceived it might be the Interest of the joint Landlords,
            since their Tenement was in so precarious a Condition, to grant a Lease to one who had
            an undisputed Authority to be liable, by acting Plays in it, to pay the Rent of it;
            especially when he tempted them with an Offer of raising it from three to four Pounds
              <hi rend="italic">per Diem.</hi> His Project succeeded, the Lease was sign'd; but the
            Means of getting into Possession were to be left to his own Cost and Discretion. This
            took him up but little Time; he immediately laid Siege to it with a sufficient Number of
            Forces, whether lawless or lawful I forget, but they were such as obliged the old
            Governor to give it up; who, notwithstanding, had got Intelligence of his Approaches and
            Design time enough to carry off every thing that was worth moving, except a great <pb
              n="93" entity="DSSR_000002933_0126"/> Number of old Scenes and new Actors that could
            not easily follow him. <ref target="n93-1" n="69">[93.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>A ludicrous Account of this Transaction, under fictitious Names, may be found in the
            99th <hi rend="italic">Tatler,</hi> Vol. 2. which this Explanation may now render more
            intelligible to the Readers of that agreeable Author. <ref target="n93-2" n="70"
            >[93.2]</ref>
          </p>

          <pb n="94" entity="DSSR_000002933_0127"/>
          <p>This other new License being now in Possession of the <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi>
            Theatre, those Actors whom the Patentee ever since the Order of Silence had retain'd in
            a State of Inaction, all to a Man came over to the Service of <hi rend="italic"
            >Collier</hi>. Of these <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> was then the chief. <ref
              target="n94-1" n="71">[94.1]</ref> The Merit of the rest had as yet made no
            considerable Appearance, and as the Patentee had not left a Rag of their Cloathing
            behind him, they were but poorly equip'd for a publick Review; consequently at their
            first Opening they were very little able to annoy us. But during the Trial of <hi
              rend="italic">Sacheverel</hi> our Audiences were extremely weaken'd by the better Rank
            of People's daily attending it: While, at the same time, the lower Sort, who were <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0128"/> not equally admitted to that grand Spectacle, as
            eagerly crowded into <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi> to a new Comedy call'd <hi
              rend="italic">The fair Quaker of Deal.</hi> This Play having some low Strokes of
            natural Humour in it, was rightly calculated for the Capacity of the Actors who play'd
            it, and to the Taste of the Multitude who were now more disposed and at leisure to see
            it: <ref target="n95-1" n="72">[95.1]</ref> But the most happy Incident in its Fortune
            was the Charm of the fair Quaker which was acted by Miss <hi rend="italic">Santlow,</hi>
            (afterwards Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi>) whose Person was then in the full Bloom
            of what Beauty she might pretend to: Before this she had only been admired as the most
            excellent Dancer, which perhaps might not a little contribute to the favourable
            Reception she now met with as an Actress, in this Character which so happily suited her
            Figure and Capacity: The gentle Softness of her Voice, the composed Innocence of her
            Aspect, the Modesty of her Dress, <pb n="96" entity="DSSR_000002933_0129"/> the reserv'd
            Decency of her Gesture, and the Simplicity of the Sentiments that naturally fell from
            her, made her seem the amiable Maid she represented: In a Word, not the enthusiastick
            Maid of <hi rend="italic">Orleans</hi> was more serviceable of old to the <hi
              rend="italic">French</hi> Army when the <hi rend="italic">English</hi> had distressed
            them, than this fair Quaker was at the Head of that dramatick Attempt upon which the
            Support of their weak Society depended. <ref target="n96-1" n="73">[96.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>But when the Trial I have mention'd and the Run of this Play was over, the Tide of the
            Town beginning to turn again in our Favour, <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi> was reduced

            <p> At the Union, 1707-8, the Lord Chamberlain took measures to assert his supremacy.
              Under date 6th January, 1708, he orders that no actors are to be engaged at Drury-Lane
              who are not Her Majesty's servants, and he therefore directs the managers to send a
              list of all actors to be sworn in.</p>

            <p> The whole passage regarding Nicolini is:&mdash;</p>
            <q>"I went on <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> last to the Opera, and was surprised to find
              a thin House at so noble an Entertainment, till I heard that the Tumbler was not to
              make his Appearance that Night. For my own Part, I was fully satisfied with the Sight
              of an Actor, who, by the Grace and Propriety of his Action and Gesture, does Honour to
              an human Figure, as much as the other vilifies and degrades it. Every one will easily
              imagine I mean Signior <hi rend="italic">Nicolini,</hi> who sets off the Character he
              bears in an Opera by his Action, as much as he does the Words of it by his Voice.
              Every Limb, and every Finger, contributes to the Part he acts, insomuch that a deaf
              Man might go along with him in the Sense of it. There is scarce a beautiful Posture in
              an old Statue which he does not plant himself in, as the different Circumstances of
              the Story give Occasion for it. He performs the most ordinary Action in a Manner
              suitable to the Greatness of his Character, and shows the Prince even in the giving of
              a Letter, or the dispatching of a Message. Our best Actors are somewhat at a Loss to
              support themselves with proper Gesture, as they move from any considerable Distance to
              the Front of the Stage; but I have seen the Person of whom I am now speaking, enter
              alone at the remotest Part of it, and advance from it with such Greatness of Air and
              Mien, as seemed to fill the Stage, and at the same Time commanded the Attention of the
              Audience with the Majesty of his Appearance."&mdash;<bibl>"Tatler," No. 115,

            <p> An excellent account of Mrs. Tofts is given by Mr. Henry Morley in a note on page 38
              of his valuable edition of the "Spectator." She was the daughter of one of Bishop
              Burnet's household, and had great natural gifts. In 1709 she was obliged to quit the
              stage, her mental faculties having failed; but she afterwards recovered, and married
              Mr. Joseph Smith, a noted art patron, who was appointed English Counsel at Venice. Her
              intellect again became disordered, and she died about the year 1760.</p>

            <p> Cibber's most notorious blunder in language was made in this sentence. In his first
              edition he wrote "was then <hi rend="italic">but</hi> an Adept in it," completely
              reversing the meaning of the word "Adept." Fielding ("Champion," 22nd April, 1740)
              declares Cibber to be a most absolute Master of English, "for surely he must be
              absolute Master of that whose Laws he can trample under Feet, and which he can use as
              he pleases. This Power he hath exerted, of which I shall give a <hi rend="italic"

            <p> Nicolini was the stage name of the Cavalier Nicolo Grimaldi. Dr. Burney says: "This
              great singer, and still greater actor, was a Neapolitan; his voice was at first a <hi

              to England in 1708. Valentini Urbani was a <hi rend="italic">castrato,</hi> his voice
              was not so strong as Nicolini's, but his action was so excellent that his vocal

            <p> Colonel Brett, by an indenture dated 31st March 1708, made Wilks, Estcourt, and
              Cibber, his deputies in the management of the theatre. Genest (ii. 405) says this was
              probably "31st March, 1708, Old Style," by which I suppose he means March, 1709. But I
              cannot see why he should think this. Brett entered into management in January, 1708,
              and was probably out of it by March, 1709. It may be that Genest supposes that this
              indenture marks the end of Brett's connection with the theatre; whereas it was
              probably one of his first actions. It will be remembered that he stated his intention
              of benefitting Cibber by taking the Patent (see <hi rend="italic">ante,</hi> p. 42). A
              copy of the indenture is given by Mr. Percy Fitzgerald ("New History," ii. 443). It is
              dated 31st March in the seventh year of Queen Anne's reign, that is, 1708.</p>

            <p> On p. 328 of vol. i., Cibber says that Rich (about 1705) had led the Adventurers "a
              Chace in Chancery several years." From the petition presented in 1709 against the
              order silencing Rich, we learn that the principal Adventurers were: Lord Guilford,
              Lord John Harvey, Dame Alice Brownlow, Mrs. Shadwell, Sir Edward Smith, Bart., Sir
              Thomas Skipwith, Bart., George Sayer, Charles Killegrew, Christopher Rich, Charles

              East, Richard Middlemore, Robert Gower, and William Collier. It is curious that
              everyone who has produced this list has, as far as I know, mistaken the name "Frowd,"
              calling it "Trowd." The earliest reproduction of the list of names which I know is in

            <p> Dr. Doran ("Their Majesties' Servants," 1888 edition, i. 103) gives the following
              account of Goodman's connection with this plot:&mdash;</p>
            <q>"King James having saved Cardell's neck, Goodman, out of pure gratitude, perhaps,
              became a Tory, and something more, when William sat in the seat of his father-in-law.
              After Queen Mary's death, Scum was in the Fenwick and Charnock plot to kill the King.
              When the plot was discovered, Scum was ready to peach. As Fenwick's life was thought
              by his friends to be safe if Goodman could be bought off and got out of the way, the
              rogue was looked for, at the <hi rend="italic">Fleece</hi>, in Covent Garden, famous
              for homicides, and at the robbers' and the revellers' den, the <hi rend="italic"
              >Dog</hi>, in Drury Lane. Fenwick's agent, O'Bryan, erst soldier and highwayman, now a
              Jacobite agent, found Scum at the <hi rend="italic">Dog,</hi> and would then and there
              have cut his throat, had not Scum consented to the pleasant alternative of accepting
                <hi rend="italic">&pound;</hi>500 a year, and a residence abroad....Scum
              suddenly disappeared, and Lord Manchester, our Ambassador in Paris, inquired after him
              in vain. It is impossible to say whether the rogue died by an avenging hand, or
              starvation."</q>

              to return the money stopped to each particular. The dispute lasted some time, and Mr.
              Rich, not giving full satisfaction upon that head, was silenced; during the time of
              which silence, the chief Players, either by a new License, or by some former (which I
              cannot absolutely determine, my Memoirs being not at this time by me) set up for

              <hi rend="italic">July</hi> 1. 1710.</p>
            <p>"Finding by divers of your late Papers, that you are a Friend to the Profession of
              which I was many Years an unworthy Member, I the rather make bold to crave your
              Advice, touching a Proposal that has been lately made me of coming into Business, and
              the Sub-Administration of Stage Affairs. I have, from my Youth, been bred up behind
              the Curtain, and been a Prompter from the Time of the Restoration. I have seen many
              Changes, as well of Scenes as of Actors, and have known Men within my Remembrance
              arrive to the highest Dignities of the Theatre, who made their Entrance in the Quality
              of Mutes, Joynt-stools, Flower-pots, and Tapestry Hangings. It cannot be unknown to
              the Nobility and Gentry, That a Gentleman of the Inns of Court, and a deep Intriguer,
              had some Time since worked himself into the sole Management and Direction of the
              Theatre. Nor is it less notorious, That his restless Ambition, and subtle
              Machinations, did manifestly tend to the Extirpation of the good old <hi rend="italic"
                >British</hi> Actors, and the Introduction of foreign Pretenders; such as
              Harlequins, <hi rend="italic">French</hi> Dancers, and <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi>
              Singers; which, tho' they impoverish'd the Proprietors, and imposed on the Audience,
              were for some Time tolerated, by Reason of his dextrous Insinuations, which prevailed
              upon a few deluded Women, especially the Vizard Masks, to believe, that the Stage was
              in Danger. But his Schemes were soon exposed, and the Great Ones that supported him
              withdrawing their Favour, he made his <hi rend="italic">Exit</hi>, and remained for a
              Season in Obscurity. During this Retreat the Machiavilian was not idle, but secretly
              fomented Divisions, and wrought over to his Side some of the inferior Actors,
              reserving a Trap Door to himself, to which only he had a Key. This Entrance secured,
              this cunning Person, to compleat his Company, bethought himself of calling in the most
              eminent of Strollers from all Parts of the Kingdom. I have seen them all ranged
              together behind the Scenes; but they are many of them Persons that never trod the
              Stage before, and so very aukward and ungainly, that it is impossible to believe the
              Audience will bear them. He was looking over his Catalogue of Plays, and indeed picked
              up a good tolerable Set of grave Faces for Counsellors, to appear in the famous Scene
              of <hi rend="italic">Venice Preserved,</hi> which the Danger is over; but they being
              but meer Outsides, and the Actors having a great Mind to play the <hi rend="italic"
                >Tempest</hi>, there is not a Man of them when he is to perform any Thing above Dumb

            <p> The Lord Chamberlain's Records enable an exact account to be given of the
              transactions which led to the formation of this Haymarket Company. After Rich was
              silenced, his actors petitioned the Lord Chamberlain on three separate occasions,
              namely, 10th June, 20th June, and 5th July, 1709, and in answer to their petitions,
              the Haymarket, which was then devoted solely to Opera, was permitted to be used for
              Plays also. In an Answer to the actors' petitions, the Lord Chamberlain permits the
              manager of the Haymarket to engage such of them as he wished, and to act Plays four
              times a week, the other days being devoted to Operas. This License is dated 8th July,
              1709. This is, of course, only a formal sanction of the private arrangement mentioned
              by Cibber <hi rend="italic">ante</hi> p. 69; and was resented by Booth and others who
              were in Rich's favour. They therefore petitioned the Queen direct, in despite of the
              Lord Chamberlain (see "Dramatic Censor," 1811, col. 112; Genest, ii. 426; Mr.
              Fitzgerald's "New History," i. 273), but no result followed, until Collier's advent,

            <p> The description of the shape of the stage which follows is interesting and valuable.
              In early times the stage was a platform surrounded by the audience, not, as now, a
              picture framed by the proscenium. This is evident, not only from descriptive
              allusions, but from the two drawings which have come down to us of the interior of
              pre-Restoration theatres&mdash;DeWitt's drawing of the Swan Theatre in 1596,
              reproduced in Herr Gaedertz's "Zur Kenntniss der altenglischen B&uuml;hne"
              (Bremen, 1888), and the well-known print of the Red Bull Theatre during the
              Commonwealth, which forms the frontispiece to Kirkman's "The Wits, or Sport upon
              Sport" (1672). In both of them the pit entirely surrounds the stage on three sides,
              while the fourth side also contains spectators in boxes placed above the
              entrance-doors. By gradual modifications the shape of the stage has changed, till now
              the audience is confined to one side. The doors used for entrances and exits, to which
              Cibber alludes, have disappeared comparatively recently. They may be seen, for
              instance, in Cruikshank's plates to Dickens's "Grimaldi."</p>

            <p> Charles Shadwell's "Fair Quaker of Deal" was produced at Drury Lane on 25th
              February, 1710. In the Preface the author says, "This play was written about three
              years since, and put into the hands of a famous Comedian belonging to the Haymarket
              Playhouse, who took care to beat down the value of it so much, as to offer the author
              to alter it fit to appear on the stage, on condition he might have half the profits of
              the third day, and the dedication entire; that is as much as to say, that it may pass
              for one of his, according to custom. The author not agreeing to this reasonable
              proposal, it lay in his hands till the beginning of this winter, when Mr. Booth read
              it, and liked it, and persuaded the author, that, with a little alteration, it would
              please the town" (Bell's edition). If, as is likely, Cibber is the actor referred to,
              his abuse of the play and the actors is not unintelligible.</p>

            liv'd half their Time, will be able to remember.</p>
          <p>Though the Patent had been often under Distresses, it had never felt any Blow equal to
            this unrevoked Order of Silence; which it is not easy to conceive could have fallen upon
            any other Person's Conduct than that of the old Patentee: For if he was conscious of his
            being under the Subjection of that Power which had silenc'd him, why would he incur the
            Danger of a Suspension by his so obstinate and impolitick Treatment of his Actors? If he
            thought such Power over him illegal, how came he to obey it now more than before, when
            he slighted a former Order that injoin'd him to give his Actors their Benefits on their
            usual Conditions? <ref target="n98-1" n="74">[98.1]</ref> But to do him Justice, the
            same Obstinacy that involv'd him in these Difficulties, at last preserv'd to his Heirs

              >[98.2]</ref> yet to suppose that he foresaw a milder use of Power in some future
            Prince's Reign might be more favourable to him, is begging at best but a cold Question.
            But whether he knew that this broken <pb n="99" entity="DSSR_000002933_0132"/> Condition
            of the Patent would not make his troublesome Friends the Adventurers fly from it as from
            a falling House, seems not so difficult a Question. However, let the Reader form his own
            Judgment of them from the Facts that follow'd: It must therefore be observ'd, that the
            Adventurers seldom came near the House but when there was some visible Appearance of a
            Dividend: But I could never hear that upon an ill Run of Audiences they had ever
            returned or brought in a single Shilling, to make good the Deficiencies of their daily
            Receipts. Therefore, as the Patentee in Possession had alone, for several Years,
            supported and stood against this Uncertainty of Fortune, it may be imagin'd that his
            Accounts were under so voluminous a Perplexity that few of those Adventurers would have
            Leisure or Capacity enough to unravel them: And as they had formerly thrown away their
            Time and Money at law in a fruitless Enquiry into them, they now seem'd to have intirely
            given up their Right and Interest: And, according to my best Information,
            notwithstanding the subsequent Gains of the Patent have been sometimes extraordinary,
            the farther Demands or Claims of Right of the Adventurers have lain dormant above these
            five and twenty Years. <ref target="n99-1" n="76">[99.1]</ref>

            Patentee, not only of the <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi> House, but likewise of those
            few Actors which he had kept for some time unemploy'd in it, we are now led to consider
            another Project of the same Patentee, which, if we are to judge of it by the Event, has
            shewn him more a Wise than a Weak Man; which I confess at the time he put it in
            Execution seem'd not so clear a Point: For notwithstanding he now saw the Authority and
            Power of his Patent was superseded, or was at best but precarious, and that he had not
            one Actor left in his Service, yet, under all these Dilemma's and Distresses, he
            resolv'd upon rebuilding the New Theatre in <hi rend="italic">Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</hi>
            of which he had taken a Lease, at a low Rent, ever since <hi rend="italic"
            >Betterton</hi>'s Company had first left it. <ref target="n100-1" n="77">[100.1]</ref>
            This Conduct seem'd too deep for my Comprehension! What are we to think of his taking
            this Lease in the height of his Prosperity, when he could have no Occasion for it? Was
            he a Prophet? Could he then foresee he should, one time or other, be turn'd out of <hi
              rend="italic">Drury-Lane?</hi> Or did his mere Appetite of Architecture urge him to
            build a House, while he could not be sure he should ever have leave to make use of it?
            But of all this we may think as we please; whatever was his Motive, he, at his own
            Expence, in this Interval of his having nothing else to do, rebuilt that Theatre from
            the Ground, as it is now <pb n="101" entity="DSSR_000002933_0134"/> standing. <ref
              target="n101-1" n="78">[101.1]</ref> As for the Order of Silence, he seem'd little
            concern'd at it while it gave him so much uninterrupted Leisure to supervise a Work
            which he naturally took Delight in.</p>
          <p>After this Defeat of the Patentee, the Theatrical Forces of <hi rend="italic"
            >Collier</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane,</hi> notwithstanding their having drawn
            the Multitude after them for about three Weeks during the Trial of <hi rend="italic"
              >Sacheverel,</hi> had made but an indifferent Campaign at the end of the Season. <hi
              rend="italic">Collier</hi> at least found so little Account in it, that it obliged him
            to push his Court-Interest (which, wherever the Stage was concern'd, was not
            inconsiderable) to support him in another Scheme; which was, that in consideration of
            his giving up the <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane,</hi> Cloaths, Scenes, and Actors, to <hi
              rend="italic">Swiney</hi>
            <pb n="102" entity="DSSR_000002933_0135"/> and his joint Sharers in the <hi
              rend="italic">Hay-Market,</hi> he (<hi rend="italic">Collier</hi>) might be put into
            an equal Possession of the <hi rend="italic">Hay-Market</hi> Theatre, with all the
            Singers, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> and be made sole Director of the Opera.
            Accordingly, by Permission of the Lord Chamberlain, a Treaty was enter'd into, and in a
            few Days ratified by all Parties, conformable to the said Preliminaries. <ref
              target="n102-1" n="79">[102.1]</ref> This was that happy Crisis of Theatrical Liberty
            which the labouring Comedians had long sigh'd for, and which, for above twenty Years
            following, was so memorably fortunate to them.</p>
          <p>However, there were two hard Articles in this Treaty, which, though it might be Policy
            in the Actors to comply with, yet the Imposition of them seem'd little less despotick
            than a Tax upon the Poor when a Government did not want it.</p>
          <p>The first of these Articles was, That whereas the sole License for acting Plays was
            presum'd to be a more profitable Authority than that for acting Operas only, that
            therefore Two Hundred Pounds a Year should be paid to <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi>,
            while Master of the Opera, by the Comedians; to whom a verbal Assurance was given by the
              <hi rend="italic">Plenipo's</hi> on the Court-side, that while such Payment subsisted
            no other Company should be permitted to act Plays against them within the Liberties, <hi
              rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> The other Article was, That on every <hi rend="italic"
              >Wednesday</hi> whereon an Opera could be perform'd, <pb n="103"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0136"/> the Plays should, <hi rend="italic">toties
            quoties,</hi> be silent at <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane,</hi> to give the Opera a fairer
            Chance for a full House.</p>
          <p>This last Article, however partial in the Intention, was in its Effect of great
            Advantage to the sharing Actors: For in all publick Entertainments a Day's Abstinence
            naturally increases the Appetite to them: Our every <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi>'s
            Audience, therefore, was visibly the better by thus making the Day before it a Fast. But
            as this was not a Favour design'd us, this Prohibition of a Day, methinks, deserves a
            little farther Notice, because it evidently took a sixth Part of their Income from all
            the hired Actors, who were only paid in proportion to the Number of acting Days. This
            extraordinary Regard to Operas was, in effect, making the Day-labouring Actors the
            principal Subscribers to them, and the shutting out People from the Play every <hi
              rend="italic">Wednesday</hi> many murmur'd at as an Abridgment of their usual Liberty.
            And tho' I was one of those who profited by that Order, it ought not to bribe me into a
            Concealment of what was then said and thought of it. I remember a Nobleman of the first
            Rank, then in a high Post, and not out of Court-Favour, said openly behind the
              Scenes&mdash;<hi rend="italic">It was shameful to take part of the Actors Bread
              from them to support the silly Diversion of People of Quality.</hi> But alas! what was
            all this Grievance when weighed against the Qualifications of so grave and stanch a
            Senator as <hi rend="italic">Collier?</hi> Such visible Merit, it seems, was to be made
            easy, tho' at <pb n="104" entity="DSSR_000002933_0137"/> the Expence of the&mdash;I
            had almost said, <hi rend="italic">Honour</hi> of the Court, whose gracious Intention
            for the Theatrical Common-wealth might have shone with thrice the Lustre if such a
            paltry Price had not been paid for it. But as the Government of the Stage is but that of
            the World in Miniature, we ought not to have wonder'd that <hi rend="italic"
            >Collier</hi> had Interest enough to quarter the Weakness of the Opera upon the Strength
            of the Comedy. General good Intentions are not always practicable to a Perfection. The
            most necessary Law can hardly pass, but a Tenderness to some private Interest shall
            often hang such Exceptions upon particular Clauses, 'till at last it comes out lame and
            lifeless, with the Loss of half its Force, Purpose, and Dignity. As, for Instance, how
            many fruitless Motions have been made in Parliaments to moderate the enormous Exactions
            in the Practice of the Law? And what sort of Justice must that be call'd, which, when a
            Man has not a mind to pay you a Debt of Ten Pounds, it shall cost you Fifty before you
            can get it? How long, too, has the Publick been labouring for a Bridge at <hi
              rend="italic">Westminster?</hi> But the Wonder that it was not built a Hundred Years
            ago ceases when we are told, That the Fear of making one End of <hi rend="italic"
            >London</hi> as rich as the other has been so long an Obstruction to it: <ref
              target="n104-1" n="80">[104.1]</ref> And though it might seem a still <pb

            <pb n="105" entity="DSSR_000002933_0142"/> greater Wonder, when a new Law for building
            one had at last got over that Apprehension, that it should meet with any farther Delay;
            yet Experience has shewn us that the Structure of this useful Ornament to our Metropolis
            has been so clogg'd by private Jobs that were to be pick'd out of the Undertaking, and
            the Progress of the Work so disconcerted by a tedious Contention of private Interests
            and Endeavours to impose upon the Publick abominable Bargains, that a whole Year was
            lost before a single Stone could be laid to its Foundation. But Posterity will owe its
            Praises to the Zeal and Resolution of a truly Noble Commissioner, whose distinguish'd
            Impatience has broke thro' those narrow Artifices, those false and frivolous Objections
            that delay'd it, and has already began to raise above the Tide that future Monument of
            his Publick Spirit. <ref target="n105-1" n="81">[105.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>How far all this may be allow'd applicable to the State of the Stage is not of so great
            Importance, nor so much my Concern, as that what is observ'd upon it should always
            remain a memorable Truth, to the Honour of that Nobleman. But now I go on: <hi
              rend="italic">Collier</hi> being thus possess'd of his Musical Government, thought his
            best way would be to farm it out <pb n="106" entity="DSSR_000002933_0143"/> to a
            Gentleman, <hi rend="italic">Aaron Hill,</hi> Esq. <ref target="n106-1" n="82"
            >[106.1]</ref> (who he had reason to suppose knew something more of Theatrical Matters
            than himself) at a Rent, if I mistake not, of Six Hundred Pounds <hi rend="italic">per
              Annum:</hi> But before the Season was ended (upon what occasion, if I could remember,
            it might not be material to say) took it into his Hands again: But all his Skill and
            Interest could not raise the Direction of the Opera to so good a Post as he thought due
            to a Person of his Consideration: He therefore, the Year following, enter'd upon another
            high-handed Scheme, which, 'till the Demise of the Queen, turn'd to his better Account.</p>
          <p>After the Comedians were in Possession of <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi>, from
            whence during my time upon the Stage they never departed, their Swarm of Audiences
            exceeded all that had been seen in thirty Years before; which, however, I do not impute
            so much to the Excellence of their Acting as to their indefatigable Industry and good
            Menagement; for, as I have often said, I never thought in the general that we stood in
            any Place of Comparison with the eminent Actors before us; perhaps, too, by there being
            now an End of the frequent Divisions and Disorders that had from time to time broke in
            upon and frustrated their Labours, not a little might be contributed to their Success.</p>
          <pb n="107" entity="DSSR_000002933_0144"/>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Collier,</hi> then, like a true liquorish Courtier, observing the
            Prosperity of a Theatre, which he the Year before had parted with for a worse, began to
            meditate an Exchange of Theatrical Posts with <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi>, who had
            visibly very fair Pretensions to that he was in, by his being first chosen by the Court
            to regulate and rescue the Stage from the Disorders it had suffer'd under its former
            Menagers: <ref target="n107-1" n="83">[107.1]</ref> Yet <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi>
            knew that sort of Merit could stand in no Competition with his being a Member of
            Parliament: He therefore had recourse to his Court-Interest (where meer Will and
            Pleasure at that time was the only Law that dispos'd of all Theatrical Rights) to oblige
              <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> to let him be off from his bad Bargain for a better. To
            this it may be imagin'd <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> demurr'd, and as he had Reason,
            strongly remonstrated against it: But as <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi> had listed his
            Conscience under the Command of Interest, he kept it to strict Duty, and was immoveable;
            insomuch that Sir <hi rend="italic">John Vanbrugh,</hi> who was a Friend to <hi
              rend="italic">Swiney</hi>, and who, by his Intimacy with the People in Power, better
            knew the Motive of their Actions, advis'd <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> rather to accept
            of the Change, than by a Non-compliance to hazard his being excluded from any Post or
            Concern in either of the Theatres: To conclude, it was not long before <hi rend="italic"
              >Collier</hi> had procured a new License for acting Plays, <hi rend="italic"
              >&amp;c.</hi> for himself, <hi rend="italic">Wilks, Dogget,</hi> and <hi
              rend="italic">Cibber,</hi> exclusive of <hi rend="italic">Swiney,</hi> who by this new
            Regulation <pb n="108" entity="DSSR_000002933_0145"/> was reduc'd to his <hi

            >[108.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p><hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> being thus transferr'd to the Opera <ref target="n108-2"
              n="85">[108.2]</ref> in the sinking of it in the Winter following, 1711, so far short
            of the Expences, that he was driven to attend his Fortune in some more favourable
            Climate, where he remain'd twenty Years an Exile from his Friends and Country, tho'
            there has been scarce an <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Gentleman who in his <hi
              rend="italic">Tour</hi> of <hi rend="italic">France</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
            >Italy</hi> has not renew'd or created an Acquaintance with him. As this is a
            Circumstance that many People may have forgot, I cannot remember it without that Regard
            and Concern it deserves from all that know him: Yet it is some Mitigation of his
            Misfortune that since his Return to <hi rend="italic">England</hi>, his grey Hairs and
            cheerful Disposition have still found a general Welcome among his foreign and former
            domestick Acquaintance.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Collier</hi> being now first-commission'd Menager with the Comedians,
            drove them, too, to the last Inch of a hard Bargain (the natural Consequence of all
            Treaties between Power and Necessity.) He not only demanded six hundred a Year neat
            Money, the Price at which he had farm'd out his Opera, and to make the Business a <hi
              rend="italic">Sine-cure</hi> to him, but likewise insisted <pb n="109"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0146"/> upon a Moiety of the Two hundred that had been levied
            upon us the Year before in Aid of the Operas; in all 700<hi rend="italic">l.</hi> These
            large and ample Conditions, considering in what Hands we were, we resolv'd to swallow
            without wry Faces; rather chusing to run any Hazard than contend with a formidable Power
            against which we had no Remedy: But so it happen'd that Fortune took better care of our
            Interest than we ourselves had like to have done: For had <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi>
            accepted of our first Offer, of an equal Share with us, he had got three hundred Pounds
            a Year more by complying with it than by the Sum he imposed upon us, our Shares being
            never less than a thousand annually to each of us, 'till the End of the Queen's Reign in
            1714. After which <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi>'s Commission was superseded, his
            Theatrical Post, upon the Accession of his late Majesty, being given to Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Richard Steele.</hi>
            <ref target="n109-1" n="86">[109.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>From these various Revolutions in the Government of the Theatre, all owing to the
            Patentees mistaken Principle of increasing their Profits by too far enslaving their
            People, and keeping down the Price of good Actors (and I could almost insist that giving
            large Sallaries to bad Ones could not have had a worse Consequence) I say, when it is
            consider'd that the Authority for acting Plays, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> was
            thought of so little worth that (as has been observ'd) Sir <hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi>
            <pb n="110" entity="DSSR_000002933_0147"/>
            <hi rend="italic">Skipwith</hi> gave away his Share of it, and the Adventurers had fled
            from it; that Mr. <hi rend="italic">Congreve</hi>, at another time, had voluntarily
            resign'd it; and Sir <hi rend="italic">John Vanbrugh</hi> (meerly to get the Rent of his
            new House paid) had, by Leave of the Court, farm'd out his License to <hi rend="italic"
              >Swiney</hi>, who not without some Hesitation had ventur'd upon it; let me say again,
            out of this low Condition of the Theatre, was it not owing to the Industry of three or
            four Comedians that a new Place was now created for the Crown to give away, without any
            Expence attending it, well worth the Acceptance of any Gentleman whose Merit or Services
            had no higher Claim to Preferment, and which <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi> and Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Richard Steele,</hi> in the two last Reigns, successively enjoy'd? Tho'
            I believe I may have said something like this in a former Chapter, <ref target="n110-1"
              n="87">[110.1]</ref> I am not unwilling it should be twice taken notice of.</p>
          <p>We are now come to that firm Establishment of the Theatre, which except the Admittance
            of <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> into a Share and <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi>'s
            retiring from it, met with no Change or Alteration for above twenty Years after.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Collier</hi>, as has been said, having accepted of a certain
            Appointment of seven hundred <hi rend="italic">per Annum, Wilks, Dogget,</hi> and Myself
            were not the only acting Menagers under the Queen's License; which being a Grant but
            during Pleasure oblig'd us to a Conduct that might not undeserve the Favour. At this <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0148"/> Time we were All in the Vigour of our Capacities as
            Actors, and our Prosperity enable us to pay at least double the Sallaries to what the
            same Actors had usually receiv'd, or could have hoped for under the Government of the
            Patentees. <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi>, who was naturally an Oeconomist, kept our
            Expences and Accounts to the best of his Power within regulated Bounds and Moderation.
              <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>, who had a stronger Passion for Glory than Lucre, was a
            little apt to be lavish in what was not always as necessary for the Profit as the Honour
            of the Theatre: For example, at the Beginning of almost every Season, he would order two
            or three Suits to be made or refresh'd for Actors of moderate Consequence, that his
            having constantly a new one for himself might seem less particular, tho' he had as yet
            no new Part for it. This expeditious Care of doing us good without waiting for our
            Consent to it, <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> always look'd upon with the Eye of a Man in
            Pain: But I, who hated Pain, (tho' I as little liked the Favour as <hi rend="italic"
              >Dogget</hi> himself) rather chose to laugh at the Circumstance, than complain of what
            I knew was not to be cured but by a Remedy worse than the Evil. Upon these Occasions,
            therefore, whenever I saw him and his Followers so prettily dress'd out for an old Play,
            I only commended his Fancy; or at most but whisper'd him not to give himself so much
            trouble about others, upon whose Performance it would but be thrown away: To which, with
            a smiling Air of Triumph over my want of Penetration, he has reply'd&mdash;Why, <pb
              n="112" entity="DSSR_000002933_0149"/> now, that was what I really did it for! to shew
            others that I love to take care of them as well as of myself. Thus, whenever he made
            himself easy, he had not the least Conception, let the Expence be what it would, that we
            could possibly dislike it. And from the same Principle, provided a thinner Audience were
            liberal of their Applause, he gave himself little Concern about the Receipt of it. As in
            these different Tempers of my Brother-Menagers there might be equally something right
            and wrong, it was equally my Business to keep well with them both: And tho' of the two I
            was rather inclin'd to <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi>'s way of thinking, yet I was always
            under the disagreeable Restraint of not letting <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> see it:
            Therefore, when in any material Point of Menagement they were ready to come to a
            Rupture, I found it adviseable to think neither of them absolutely in the wrong; but by
            giving to one as much of the Right in his Opinion this way as I took from the other in
            that, their Differences were sometimes soft'ned into Concessions, that I have reason to
            think prevented many ill Consequences in our Affairs that otherwise might have attended
            them. But this was always to be done with a very gentle Hand; for as <hi rend="italic"
              >Wilks</hi> was apt to be easily hurt by Opposition, so when he felt it he was as apt
            to be insupportable. However, there were some Points in which we were always unanimous.
            In the twenty Years while we were our own Directors, we never had a Creditor that had
            occasion to come twice for his Bill; every <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi> Morning
            discharged <pb n="113" entity="DSSR_000002933_0150"/> us of all Demands before we took a
            Shilling for our own Use. And from this time we neither ask'd any Actor, nor were
            desired by them, to sign any written Agreement (to the best of my Memory) whatsoever:
            The Rate of their respective Sallaries were only enter'd in our daily Pay-Roll; which
            plain Record every one look'd upon as good as City-Security: For where an honest Meaning
            is mutual, the mutual Confidence will be Bond enough in Conscience on both sides: But
            that I may not ascribe more to our Conduct than was really its Due, I ought to give
            Fortune her Share of the Commendation; for had not our Success exceeded our Expectation,
            it might not have been in our Power to throughly to have observ'd those laudable Rules
            of Oeconomy, Justice, and Lenity, which so happily supported us: But the Severities and
            Oppression we had suffer'd under our former Masters made us incapable of imposing them
            on others; which gave our whole Society the cheerful Looks of a rescued People. But
            notwithstanding this general Cause of Content, it was not above a Year or two before the
            Imperfection of human Nature began to shew itself in contrary Symptoms. The Merit of the
            Hazards which the Menagers had run, and the Difficulties they had combated in bringing
            to Perfection that Revolution by which they had all so amply profited in the Amendment
            of their general Income, began now to be forgotten; their Acknowledgments and thankful
            Promises of Fidelity were no more repeated, or <pb n="114" entity="DSSR_000002933_0151"
            /> scarce thought obligatory: Ease and Plenty by an habitual Enjoyment had lost their
            Novelty, and the Largeness of their Sallaries seem'd rather lessen'd than advanc'd by
            the extraordinary Gains of the Undertakers; for that is the Scale in which the hired
            Actor will always weigh his Performance; but whatever Reason there may seem to be in his
            Case, yet, as he is frequently apt to throw a little Self-partiality into the Balance,
            that Consideration may a good deal alter the Justness of it. While the Actors,
            therefore, had this way of thinking, happy was it for the Menagers that their united
            Interest was so inseparably the same, and that their Skill and Power in Acting stood in
            a Rank so far above the rest, that if the whole Body of private Men had deserted them,
            it would yet have been an easier matter for the Menagers to have pick'd up Recruits,
            than for the Deserters to have found proper Officers to head them. Here, then, in this
            Distinction lay our Security: Our being Actors ourselves was an Advantage to our
            Government which all former Menagers, who were only idle Gentlemen, wanted: Nor wa sour
            Establishment easily to be broken, while our Health and Limbs enabled us to be
            Joint-labourers in the Work we were Masters of.</p>
          <p>The only Actor who, in the Opinion of the Publick, seem'd to have had a Pretence of
            being advanc'd to a Share with us was certainly <hi rend="italic">Booth:</hi> But when
            it is consider'd how strongly he had oppos'd the Measures that had made us Menagers, by
            setting <pb n="115" entity="DSSR_000002933_0152"/> himself (as has been observ'd) at the
            Head of an opposite Interest, <ref target="n115-1" n="88">[115.1]</ref> he could not as
            yet have much to complain of: Beside, if the Court had thought him, now, an equal Object
            of Favour, it could not have been in our Power to have oppos'd his Preferment: This I
            mention, not to take from his Merit, but to shew from what Cause it was not as yet
            better provided for. Therefore it may be no Vanity to say, our having at that time no
            visible Competitors on the Stage was the only Interest that rais'd us to be the Menagers
            of it.</p>
          <p>But here let me rest a while, and since at my time of Day our best Possessions are but
            Ease and Quiet, I must be content, if I will have Sallies of Pleasure, to take up with
            those only that are to be found in Imagination. When I look back, therefore, on the
            Storms of the Stage we had been toss'd in; when I consider that various Vicissitude of
            Hopes and Fears we had for twenty Years struggled with, and found ourselves at last thus
            safely set on Shore to enjoy the Produce of our own Labours, and to have rais'd those
            Labours by our Skill and Industry to a much fairer Profit, than our Task-masters by all
            their severe and griping Government had ever reap'd from them, a good-natur'd Reader,
            that is not offended at the Comparison of great things with small, will allow was a
            Triumph in proportion equal to those that have attended the <pb n="116"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0153"/> most heroick Enterprizes for Liberty! What Transport
            could the first <hi rend="italic">Brutus</hi> feel upon his Expulsion of the <hi
              rend="italic">Tarquins</hi> greater than that which now danc'd in the Heart of a poor
            Actor, who, from an injur'd Labourer, unpaid his Hare, had made himself, without Guilt,
            a legal Menager of his own Fortune? Let the Grave and Great contemn or yawn at these low
            Conceits, but let me be happy in the Enjoyment of them! TO this Hour my Memory runs o'er
            that pleasing Prospect of Life past with little less Delight than when I was first in
            the real Possession of it. This is the natural Temper of my Mind, which my Acquaintance
            are frequently Witnesses of: And as this was all the Ambition Providence had made my
            obscure Condition capable of, I am thankful that Means were given me to enjoy the Fruits
            of it.</p>

            <p> There has been some doubt as to the locality of the theatre in Little Lincoln's Inn
              Fields, in which Betterton acted, one authority at least holding that he played in
              Gibbons' Tennis Court in Vere Street, Clare Market. But Cibber distinctly states that
              Rich rented the building which Betterton left in 1705, and old maps of London show
              clearly that Rich's theatre was in Portugal Street, just opposite the end of the ten
              unnamed street, now called Carey Street. In "A New and Exact Plan of the Cities of
              London and Westminster," published 30th August, 1738, by George Foster, "The New Play
              House" is given as the name of this building, and it is worthy of notice that Cibber,
              a few lines above, writes of "the New Theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields." See also vol.
              i. p. 192, note 1, where I quote Downes, who calls Betterton's theatre the New Theatre
              in Lincoln's Inn Fields. About 1756 this house was made a barrack; it was afterwards
              an auction room; then the China Repository of Messrs. Spode and Copeland, and was
              ultimately pulled down about 1848 to make room for the extension of the Museum of the
              Royal College of Surgeons.</p>

            Pretensions could have expected, yet it is not to be suppos'd but wiser Men might have
            mended it. As we could not all govern our selves, there were Seasons when we were not
            all fit to govern others. Our Passions and our Interest drew not always the <pb n="118"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0155"/> same way. <hi rend="italic">Self</hi> had a great Sway
            in our Debates: We had our Partialities; our Prejudices; our Favourites of less Merit;
            and our Jealousies of those who came too near us; Frailties which Societies of higher
            Consideration, while they are compos'd of Men, will not always be free from. To have
            been constantly capable of Unanimity had been a Blessing too great for our Station: One
            Mind among three People were to have had three Masters to one Servant; but when that one
            Servant is called three different ways at the same time, whose Business is to be done
            first? For my own Part, I was forced almost all my Life to give up my Share of him. And
            if I could, by Art or Persuasion, hinder others from making what I thought a wrong use
            of their Power, it was the All and utmost I desired. Yet, whatever might be our Personal
            Errors, I shall think I have no Right to speak of them farther than where the Publick
            Entertainment was affected by them. If therefore, among so many, some particular Actors
            were remarkable in any part of their private Lives, that might sometimes make the World
            merry without Doors, I hope my laughing Friends will excuse me if I do not so far comply
            with their Desires or Curiosity as to give them a Place in my History. I can only
            recommend such Anecdotes to the Amusement of a Noble Person, who (in case I conceal
            them) does me the flattering Honour to threaten my Work with a Supplement. 'Tis enough
            for me that such Actors had their Merits to the Publick: Let <pb n="119"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0156"/> those recite their Imperfections who are themselves
            without them: It is my Misfortune not to have that Qualification. Let us see then
            (whatever was amiss in it) how our Administration went forward.</p>
          <p>When we were first invested with this Power, the Joy of our so unexpectedly coming into
            it kept us for some time in Amity and Good-Humour with one another: And the Pleasure of
            reforming the many false Measures, Absurdities, and Abuses, that, like Weeds, had suck'd
            up the due Nourishment from the Fruits of the Theatre, gave us as yet no leisure for
            private Dissentions. Our daily Receipts exceeded our Imagination: And we seldom met as a
            Board to settle our weekly Accounts without the Satisfaction of Joint-Heirs just in
            Possession of an unexpected Estate that had been distantly intail'd upon them. Such a
            sudden Change of our Condition it may be imagin'd could not but throw out of us a new
            Spirit in almost every Play we appear'd in: Nor did we ever sink into that common
            Negligence which is apt to follow Good-fortune: Industry we knew was the Life of our
            Business; that it not only conceal'd Faults, but was of equal Value to greater Talents
            without it; which the Decadence once of <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi>'s Company in
              <hi rend="italic">Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</hi> had lately shewn us a Proof of.</p>
          <p>This then was that happy Period, when both Actors and Menagers were in their highest
            Enjoyment of general Content and Prosperity. Now it was that the politer World, too, by
            their decent <pb n="120" entity="DSSR_000002933_0157"/> Attention, their sensible Taste,
            and their generous Encouragements to Authors and Actors, once more saw that the Stage,
            under a due Regulation, was capable of being what the wisest Ages thought it <hi
              rend="italic">might</hi> be, The most rational Scheme that Human Wit could form to
            dissipate with Innocence the Cares of Life, to allure even the Turbulent or Ill-disposed
            from worse Meditations, and to give the leisure Hours of Business and Virtue an
            instructive Recreation.</p>
          <p>If this grave Assertion is less recommended by falling from the Pen of a Comedian, I
            must appeal for the Truth of it to the Tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi>, which was
            first acted in 1712. <ref target="n120-1" n="90">[120.1]</ref> I submit to the Judgment
            of those who were then the sensible Spectators of it, if the Success and Merit of that
            Play was not an Evidence of every Article of that Value which I have given to a decent
            Theatre? But (as I was observing) it could not be expected the Summer <pb n="121"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0158"/> Days I am speaking of could be the constant Weather of
            the Year; we had our clouded Hours as well as our sun-shine, and were not always in the
            same Good-Humour with one another: Fire, Air, and Water could not be more vexatiously
            opposite than the different Tempers of the Three Menagers, though they might equally
            have their useful as well as their destructive Qualities. How variously these Elements
            in our several Dispositions operated may be judged from the following single Instance,
            as well as a thousand others, which, if they were all to be told, might possibly make my
            Reader wish I had forgot them.</p>
          <p>Much about this time, then, there came over from <hi rend="italic">Dublin</hi> Theatre
            two uncelebrated Actors to pick up a few Pence among us in the Winter, as <hi
              rend="italic">Wilks</hi> had a Year or two before done on their side the Water in the
            Summer. <ref target="n121-1" n="91">[121.1]</ref> But it was not so clear to <hi
              rend="italic">Dogget</hi> and myself that it was in their Power to do us the same
            Service in <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane</hi> as <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> might have
            done them in <hi rend="italic">Dublin.</hi> However, <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> was so
            much a Man of Honour that he scorned to be outdone in <pb n="122"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0159"/> the least Point of it, let the Cost be what it would to
            his Fellow-Menagers, who had no particular Accounts of Honour open with them. To acquit
            himself therefore with a better Grace, <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> so order'd it, that
            his <hi rend="italic">Hibernian</hi> Friends were got upon our Stage before any other
            Menager had well heard of their Arrival. This so generous Dispatch of their Affair gave
              <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> a very good Chance of convincing his Friends that Himself
            was sole Master of the Masters of the Company. Here, now, the different Elements in our
            Tempers began to work with us. While <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> was only animated by a
            grateful Hospitality to his Friends, <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> was ruffled into a
            Storm, and look'd upon this Generosity as so much Insult and Injustice upon himself and
            the Fraternity. During this Disorder I stood by, a seeming quiet Passenger, and, since
            talking to the Winds I knew could be to no great Purpose (whatever Weakness it might be
            call'd) could not help smiling to observe with what officious Ease and Delight <hi
              rend="italic">Wilks</hi> was treating his Friends at our Expence, who were scarce
            acquainted with them: For it seems all this was to end in their having a Benefit-Play in
            the Height of the Season, for the unprofitable Service they had done us without our
            Consent or Desire to employ them. Upon this <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> bounc'd and
            grew almost as untractable as <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> himself. Here, again, I was
            forc'd to clap my Patience to the Helm to weather this difficult Point between them:
            Applying myself therefore to the Person I imagin'd was most <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0160"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0161"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0162"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0163"/>
            <pb n="123" entity="DSSR_000002933_0164"/> likely to hear me, I desired <hi
              rend="italic">Dogget</hi> "to consider that "I must naturally be as much hurt by this
            vain and "over-bearing Behaviour in <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> as he could be; "and
            that tho' it was true these Actors had no Pretence "to the Favour design'd them, yet we
            could "not say they had done us any farther Harm, than "letting the Town see the Parts
            they had been "shewn in, had been better done by those to whom "they properly belong'd:
            Yet as we had greatly "profited by the extraordinary Labour of <hi rend="italic"
            >Wilks,</hi> who "acted long Parts almost every Day, and at least "twice to <hi
              rend="italic">Dogget</hi>'s once; <ref target="n123-1" n="92">[123.1]</ref> and that I
            granted it "might not be so much his Consideration of our "common Interest, as his
            Fondness for Applause, "that set him to Work, yet even that Vanity, if he "supposed it
            such, had its Merit to us; and as we "had found our Account in it, it would be Folly
            "upon a Punctilio to tempt the Rashness of a Man, "who was capable to undo all he had
            done, by any "Act of Extravagance that might fly into his Head: "That admitting this
            Benefit might be some little "Loss to us, yet to break with him upon it could not "but
            be ten times of worse Consequence, than our "overlooking his disagreeable manner of
            making the "Demand upon us."</p>
          <p>Though I found this had made <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> drop the Severity of his
            Features, yet he endeavoured still to seem uneasy, by his starting a new Objection,
            which <pb n="124" entity="DSSR_000002933_0165"/> was, That we could not be sure even of
            the Charge they were to pay for it: For <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>, said he, you know,
            will go any Lengths to make it a good Day to them, and may whisper the Door-keepers to
            give them the Ready-money taken, and return the Account in such Tickets only as these
            Actors have not themselves disposed of. To make this easy too, I gave him my Word to be
            answerable for the Charge my self. Upon this he acceded, and accordingly they had the
            Benefit-Play. But so it happen'd (whether as <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> had suspected
            or not, I cannot say) the Ready-money receiv'd fell Ten Pounds short of the Sum they had
            agreed to pay for it. Upon the <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> following, (the Day on
            which we constantly made up our Accounts) I went early to the Office, and inquired if
            the Ten Pounds had yet been paid in; but not hearing that one Shilling of it had found
            its way thither, I immediately supply'd the Sum our of my own Pocket, and directed the
            Treasurer to charge it received from me in the deficient Receipt of the Benefit-Day.
            Here, now, it might be imagined, all this silly Matter was accommodated, and that no one
            could so properly say he was aggrieved as myself: But let us observe what the
            Consequence says&mdash;why, the Effect of my insolent interposing honesty prov'd to
            be this: That the Party most oblig'd was the most offended; and the Offence was imputed
            to me who had been Ten Pounds out of Pocket to be able to commit it: For when <hi
              rend="italic">Wilks</hi> found in the Account how spitefully the Ten Pounds had been
            paid in, he <pb n="125" entity="DSSR_000002933_0166"/> took me aside into the adjacent
            Stone-Passage, and with some Warmth ask'd me, What I meant by pretending to pay in this
            Ten Pounds? And that, for his part, he did not understand such Treatment. To which I
            reply'd, That tho' I was amaz'd at his thinking himself ill-treated, I would give him a
            plain, justifiable Answer.&mdash;That I had give my Word to <hi rend="italic"
            >Dogget</hi> the Charge of the Benefit should be fully paid, and since his Friends had
            neglected it, I found myself bound to make it good. Upon which he told me I was mistaken
            if I thought he did not see into the bottom of all this&mdash;That <hi rend="italic"
              >Dogget</hi> and I were always endeavouring to thwart and make him uneasy; but he was
            able to stand upon his own Legs, and we should find he would not be used so: That he
            took this Payment of the Ten Pounds as an Insult upon him and a Slight to his Friends;
            but rather than suffer it he would tear the whole Business to pieces: That I knew it was
            in his Power to do it; and if he could not do a civil thing to a Friend without all this
            senseless Rout about it, he could be received in <hi rend="italic">Ireland</hi> upon his
            own Terms, and could as easily mend a Company there as he had done here: That if he were
            gone, <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> and I would not be able to keep the Doors open a
            Week; and, by G&mdash;, he would not be a Drudge for nothing. As I knew all this was
            but the Foam of the high Value he had set upon himself, I thought it not amiss to seem a
            little silently concerned, for the helpless Condition to which his Resentment of the
            Injury I have related <pb n="126" entity="DSSR_000002933_0167"/> was going to reduce us:
            For I knew I had a Friend in his Heart that, if I gave him a little time to cool, would
            soon bring him to Reason: The sweet Morsel of a Thousand Pounds a Year was not to be met
            with at every Table, and might tempt a nicer Palate than his own to swallow it, when he
            was not out of Humour. This I knew would always be of weight with him, when the best
            Arguments I could use would be of none. I therefore gave him no farther Provocation than
            by gravely telling him, We all had it in our Power to do one another a Mischief; but I
            believed none of us much cared to hurt ourselves; that if he was not of my Opinion, it
            would not be in my Power to hinder whatever new Scheme he might resolve upon; that <hi
              rend="italic">London</hi> would always have a Play-house, and I should have some
            Chance in it, tho' it might not be so good as it had been; that he might be sure, if I
            had thought my paying in the Ten Pounds could have been so ill received, I should have
            been glad to have saved it. Upon this he seem'd to mutter something to himself, and
            walk'd off as if he had a mind to be alone. I took the Occasion, and return'd to <hi
              rend="italic">Dogget</hi> to finish our Accounts. In about six Minutes <hi
              rend="italic">Wilks</hi> came in to us, not in the best Humour, it may be imagined;
            yet not in so ill a one but that he took his Share of the Ten Pounds without shewing the
            least Contempt of it; which, had he been proud enough to have refused, or to have paid
            in himself, I might have thought he intended to make good his Menaces, and that the <pb
              n="127" entity="DSSR_000002933_0168"/> Injury I had done him would never have been
            forgiven; but it seems we had different ways of thinking. </p>
          <p>Of this kind, more or less delightful, was the Life I led with this impatient Man for
            full twenty Years. <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi>, as we shall find, could not hold it so
            long; but as he had more Money than I, he had not Occasion for so much Philosophy. And
            thus were our Theatrical Affairs frequently disconcerted by this irascible Commander,
            this <hi rend="italic">Achilles</hi> of our Confederacy, who, I may be bold to say, came
            very little short of the Spirit <hi rend="italic">Horace</hi> gives to that Hero in
            his&mdash; <hi rend="italic">Impiger, iracundus, inexorabilis, acer.</hi>
            <ref target="n127-1" n="93">[127.1]</ref> This, then, is one of those Personal Anecdotes
            of our Variances, which, as our publick Performances were affected by it, could not,
            with regard to Truth and Justice, be omitted.</p>
          <p>From this time to the Year 1712 my Memory (from which Repository alone every Article of
            what I write is collected) has nothing worth mentioning, 'till the first acting of the
            Tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi>. <ref target="n127-2" n="94">[127.2]</ref> As to
            the Play itself, it might be enough to say, That the Author and the Actors had their
            different Hopes of Fame and Profit amply answer'd by the Performance; but as its Success
            was attended with remarkable Consequences, it may not be amiss to trace it from its
            several Years Concealment in the Closet, to the Stage.</p>
          <pb n="128" entity="DSSR_000002933_0169"/>
          <p>In 1703, nine Years before it was acted, I had the Pleasure of reading the first four
            Acts (which was all of it then written) privately with Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard
              Steele:</hi> It may be needless to say it was impossible to lay them out of my Hand
            'till I had gone thro' them, or to dwell upon the Delight his Friendship to the Author
            receiv'd upon my being so warmly pleas'd with them: But my satisfaction was as highly
            disappointed when he told me, Whatever Spirit Mr. <hi rend="italic">Addison</hi> had
            shewn in his writing it, he doubted he would never have Courage enough to let his <hi
              rend="italic">Cato</hi> stand the Censure of an <hi rend="italic">English</hi>
            Audience; that it had only been the Amusement of his leisure Hours in <hi rend="italic"
              >Italy</hi>, and was never intended for the Stage. This Poetical Diffidence <ref
              target="n128-1" n="95">[128.1]</ref> Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi> himself spoke
            of with some Concern, and in the Transport of his Imagination could not help saying, <hi
              rend="italic">Good God! what a Part would</hi> Betterton <hi rend="italic">make
            of</hi> Cato! But this was seven Years before <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi> died, and
            when <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> (who afterwards made his Fortune by acting it) was in
            his Theatrical Minority. In the latter end of Queen <hi rend="italic">Anne</hi>'s Reign,
            when our National Politicks had changed Hands, the Friends of Mr. <hi rend="italic"
              >Addison</hi> then thought it a proper time to animate the Publick with the Sentiments
            of <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi>; in a word, their Importunities were too warm to be
            resisted; and it was no sooner finish'd than hurried to the Stage, in <hi rend="italic"
              >April</hi>, <pb n="129" entity="DSSR_000002933_0170"/> 1712, <ref target="n129-1"
              n="96">[129.1]</ref> at a time when three Days a Week were usually appointed for the
            Benefit Plays of particular Actors: But a Work of that critical Importance was to make
            its way through all private Considerations; nor could it possibly give place to a
            Custom, which the Breach of could very little prejudice the Benefits, that on so
            unavoidable an Occasion were (in part, tho' not wholly) postpon'd; it was therefore (<hi
              rend="italic">Mondays</hi> excepted) acted every Day for a Month to constantly crowded
            Houses. <ref target="n129-2" n="97">[129.2]</ref> As the Author had made us a Present of
            whatever Profits he might have claim'd from it, we thought our selves oblig'd to spare
            no Cost in the proper Decorations of it. Its coming so late in the Season to the Stage
            prov'd of particular Advantage to the sharing Actors, because the Harvest of our annual
            Gains was generally over before the middle of <hi rend="italic">March,</hi> many select
            Audiences being then usually reserv'd in favour to the Benefits of private Actors; which
            fixt Engagements naturally abated the Receipts of the Days before and after them: But
            this unexpected Aftercrop of <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> largely <pb n="130"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0171"/> supplied to us those Deficiencies, and was almost equal
            to two fruitful Seasons in the same Year; at the Close of which the three menaging
            Actors found themselves each a Gainer of thirteen hundred and fifty Pounds: But to
            return to the first Reception of this Play from the Publick.</p>
          <p>Although <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> seems plainly written upon what are called <hi
              rend="italic">Whig</hi> Principles, yet the <hi rend="italic">Torys</hi> of that time
            had Sense enough not to take it as the least Reflection upon their Administration; but,
            on the contrary, they seem'd to brandish and vaunt their Approbation of every Sentiment
            in favour of Liberty, which, by a publick Act of their Generosity, was carried so high,
            that one Day, while the Play was acting, they collected fifty Guineas in the Boxes, and
            made a Present of them to <hi rend="italic">Booth,</hi> with this
              Compliment&mdash;<hi rend="italic">For his honest Opposition to a perpetual
              Dictator, and his dying so bravely in the Cause of Liberty:</hi> What was insinuated
            by any Part of these Words is not my Affair; <ref target="n130-1" n="98">[130.1]</ref>
            but so publick a Reward had the Appearance of a laudable Spirit, which only such a Play
            as <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> could have inspired; nor could <hi rend="italic"
            >Booth</hi> be blam'd if, upon so particular a Distinction of his Merit, he began
            himself to set more Value upon it: How far he might carry it, in making use of the
            Favour he stood in with a certain Nobleman <ref target="n130-2" n="99">[130.2]</ref>
            then in Power at Court, was not difficult <pb n="131" entity="DSSR_000002933_0172"/> to
            penetrate, and indeed ought always to have been expected by the menaging Actors: For
            which of them (making the Case every way his own) could with such Advantages have
            contented himself in the humble Station of an hired Actor? But let us see how the
            Menagers stood severally affected upon this Occasion.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi>, who expected, though he fear'd not, the Attempt of what
            after happen'd, imagin'd he had thought of an Expedient to prevent it: And to cover his
            Design with all the Art of a Statesman, he insinuated to us (for he was a staunch <hi
              rend="italic">Whig</hi>) that this Present of fifty Guineas was a sort of a <hi
              rend="italic">Tory</hi> Triumph which they had no Pretence to; and that for his Part
            he could not bear that so redoubted a Champion for Liberty as <hi rend="italic"
            >Cato</hi> should be bought off to the Cause of a Contrary Party: He therefore, in the
            seeming Zeal of his Heart, proposed that the Menagers themselves should make the same
            Present to <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> which had been made him from the Boxes the Day
            before. This, he said, would recommend the Equality and liberal Spirit of our Menagement
            to the Town, and might be a Means to secure <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> more firmly in
            our Interest, it never having been known that the Skill of the best Actor had receiv'd
            so round a Reward or Gratuity in one Day <pb n="132" entity="DSSR_000002933_0173"/>
            before. <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>, who wanted nothing but Abilities to be as cunning
            as <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi>, was so charm'd with the Proposal that he long'd that
            Moment to make <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> the Present with his own Hands; and though
            he knew he had no Right to do it without my Consent, had no Patience to ask it; upon
            which I turned to <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> with a cold Smile, and told him, that if
              <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> could be purchas'd at so cheap a Rate, it would be one of
            the best Proofs of his Oeconomy we had ever been beholden to: I therefore desired we
            might have a little Patience; that our doing it too hastily might be only making sure of
            an Occasion to throw the fifty Guineas away; for if we should be obliged to do better
            for him, we could never expect that <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> would think himself
            bound in Honour to refund them. This seem'd so absurd an Argument to <hi rend="italic"
              >Wilks</hi> that he began, with his usual Freedom of Speech, to treat it as a pitiful
            Evasion of their intended Generosity: But <hi rend="italic">Dogget,</hi> who was not so
            wide of my Meaning, clapping his Hand upon mine, said, with an Air of Security, O! don't
            trouble yourself! there must be two Words to that Bargain; let me alone to menage that
            Matter. <hi rend="italic">Wilks,</hi> upon this dark Discourse, grew uneasy, as if there
            were some Secret between us that he was to be left out of. Therefore, to avoid the Shock
            of his Intemperance, I was reduc'd to tell him that it was my Opinion, that <hi
              rend="italic">Booth</hi> would never be made easy by any thing we could do for him,
            'till he had a Share in the Profits and Menagement; and that, as he did not want Friends

            before, every one would think, since his acting of <hi rend="italic">Cato,</hi> he had
            now enough to back his Pretensions to it. To which <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi>
            reply'd, that nobody could think his Merit was slighted by so handsome a Present as
            fifty Guineas; and that, for his farther Pretensions, whatever the License might avail,
            our Property of House, Scenes, and Cloaths were our own, and not in the Power of the
            Crown to dispose of. To conclude, my Objections that the Money would be only thrown
            away, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> were over-rul'd, and the same Night <hi
              rend="italic">Booth</hi> had the fifty Guineas, which he receiv'd with a Thankfulness
            that made <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> perfectly easy,
            insomuch that they seem'd for some time to triumph in their Conduct, and often
            endeavour'd to laugh my Jealousy out of Countenance: But in the following Winter the
            Game happen'd to take a different Turn; and then, if it had been a laughing Matter, I
            had as strong an Occasion to smile at their former Security. But before I make an End of
            this Matter, I cannot pass over the good Fortune of the Company that followed us to the
            Act at <hi rend="italic">Oxford,</hi> which was held in the intervening Summer: Perhaps,
            too, a short View of the Stage in that different Situation may not be unacceptable to
            the Curious.</p>
          <p>After the Restoration of King <hi rend="italic">Charles,</hi> before the <hi
              rend="italic">Cavalier</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Round-head</hi> Parties, under their
            new Denomination of <hi rend="italic">Whig</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tory,</hi> began
            again to be politically troublesome, publick Acts at <hi rend="italic">Oxford</hi> (as I

            written by <hi rend="italic">Dryden</hi>
            <ref target="n134-1" n="100">[134.1]</ref> for <hi rend="italic">Hart</hi> on those
            Occasions) had been more frequently held than in late Reigns. Whether the same
            Party-Dissentions may have occasion'd the Discontinuance of them, is a Speculation not
            necessary to be enter'd into. But these Academical Jubilees have usually been look'd
            upon as a kind of congratulatory Compliment to the Accession of every new Prince to the
            Throne, and generally, as such, have attended them. King <hi rend="italic">James</hi>
            <ref target="n134-2" n="101">[134.2]</ref> , notwithstanding his Religion, had the
            Honour of it; at which the Players, as usual, assisted. This I have only mention'd to
            give the Reader a Theatrical Anecdote of a Liberty which <hi rend="italic">Tony
            Leigh</hi> the Comedian took with the Character of the well known <hi rend="italic"
              >Obadiah Walker,</hi>
            <ref target="n134-3" n="102">[134.3]</ref> then Head of <hi rend="italic">University

            acted the Part of <hi rend="italic">Teague,</hi> hauling in <hi rend="italic"
            >Obadiah</hi> with an Halter about his Neck, whom, according to his written Part, he was
            to threaten to hang for no better Reason than his refusing to drink <pb n="135"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0176"/> the King's Health, (but here <hi rend="italic"
            >Leigh</hi>) to justify his Purpose with a stronger Provocation, put himself into a more
            than ordinary Heat with his Captive <hi rend="italic">Obadiah,</hi> which having
            heightened his Master's Curiosity to know what <hi rend="italic">Obadiah</hi> had done
            to deserve such Usage, <hi rend="italic">Leigh,</hi> folding his Arms, with a ridiculous
            Stare of Astonishment, reply'd&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Upon my Shoule, he has shange
              his Religion.</hi> As the Merit of this Jest lay chiefly in the Auditors' sudden
            Application of it to the <hi rend="italic">Obadiah</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
            >Oxford,</hi> it was received with all the Triumph of Applause which the Zeal of a
            different Religion could inspire. But <hi rend="italic">Leigh</hi> was given to
            understand that the King was highly displeased at it, inasmuch as it had shewn him that
            the University was in a Temper to make a Jest of his Proselyte. But to return to the
            Conduct of our own Affairs there in 1712. <ref target="n135-1" n="103">[135.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>It had been a Custom for the Comedians while at <hi rend="italic">Oxford</hi> to act
            twice a Day; the first Play ending every Morning before the College Hours of dining, and
            the other never to break into the time of shutting their Gates in the Evening. This
            extraordinary Labour gave all the hired Actors a Title to double Pay, which, at the Act
            in King <hi rend="italic">William</hi>'s Time, I had myself accordingly received there.
            But the present Menagers considering that, by acting only once a Day, their Spirits
            might be fresher for every single <pb n="136" entity="DSSR_000002933_0177"/>
            Performance, and that by this Means they might be able to fill up the Term of their
            Residence, without the Repetition of their best and strongest Plays; and as their
            Theatre was contrived to hold a full third more than the usual Form of it had done, one
            House well fill'd might answer the Profits of two but moderately taken up: Being
            enabled, too, by their late Success at <hi rend="italic">London</hi>, to make the
            Journey pleasant and profitable to the rest of their Society, they resolved to continue
            to them their double Pay, notwithstanding this new Abatement of half their Labour. This
            Conduct of the Menagers more than answer'd their Intention, which was rather to get
            nothing themselves than not let their Fraternity be the better for the Expedition. Thus
            they laid an Obligation upon their Company, and were themselves considerably, though
            unexpected, Gainers by it. But my chief Reason for bringing the Reader to <hi
              rend="italic">Oxford</hi> was to shew the different Taste of Plays there from that
            which prevail'd at <hi rend="italic">London</hi>. A great deal of that false, flashy Wit
            and forc'd Humour, which had been the Delight of our Metropolitan Multitude, was only
            rated there at its bare intrinsick Value; <ref target="n136-1" n="104">[136.1]</ref>
            Applause was not to be purchased there <pb n="137" entity="DSSR_000002933_0178"/> but by
            the true Sterling, the <hi rend="italic">Sal Atticum</hi> of a Genius, unless where the
            Skill of the Actor pass'd it upon them with some extraordinary Strokes of Nature. <hi
              rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi> had there a sort of
            classical Authority; for whose masterly Scenes they seem'd to have as implicit a
            Reverence as formerly for the Ethicks of <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>; and were as
            incapable of allowing Moderns to be their Competitors, as of changing their Academical
            Habits for gaudy Colours or Embroidery. Whatever Merit, therefore, some few of our more
            politely-written Comedies might pretend to, they had not the same Effect upon the
            Imagination there, nor were received with that extraordinary Applause they had met with
            from the People of Mode and Pleasure in <hi rend="italic">London,</hi> whose vain
            Accomplishments did not dislike themselves in the Glass that was held to them: The
            elegant Follies of higher Life were not at <hi rend="italic">Oxford</hi> among their
            Acquaintance, and consequently might not be so good Company to a learned Audience as
            Nature, in her plain Dress and unornamented, in her Pursuits and Inclinations seem'd to
            be.</p>
          <p>The only distinguish'd Merit allow'd to any modern Writer <ref target="n137-1" n="105"
              >[137.1]</ref> was to the Author of <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi>, which <pb n="138"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0179"/> Play being the Flower of a Plant raised in that learned
            Garden, (for there Mr. <hi rend="italic">Addison</hi> had his Education) what favour may
            we not suppose was due to him from an Audience of Brethren, who from that local Relation
            to him might naturally have a warmer Pleasure in their Benevolence to his Fame? But not
            to give more Weight to this imaginary Circumstance than it may bear, the Fact was, that
            on our first Day of acting it our House was in a manner invested, and Entrance demanded
            by twelve a Clock at Noon, and before one it was not wide enough for many who came too
            late for Places. The same Crowds continued for three Days together, (an uncommon
            Curiosity in that Place) and the Death of <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> triumph'd over the
            Injuries of <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi> every where. To conclude, our
            Reception at <hi rend="italic">Oxford,</hi> whatever our Merit might be, exceeded our
            Expectation. At our taking Leave we had the Thanks of the Vice-Chancellor for the
            Decency and Order observ'd by our whole Society, an Honour which had not always been
            paid upon the same Occasions; for at <pb n="139" entity="DSSR_000002933_0180"/> the Act
            in King <hi rend="italic">William</hi>'s Time I remember some Pranks of a different
            Nature had been complain'd of. Our Receipts had not only enabled us (as I have observ'd)
            to double the Pay of every Actor, but to afford out of them towards the Repair of St.
              <hi rend="italic">Mary</hi>'s Church the Contribution of fifty Pounds: Besides which,
            each of the three Menagers had to his respective Share, clear of all Charges, one
            hundred and fifty more for his one and twenty Day's Labour, which being added to his
            thirteen hundred and fifty shared in the Winter preceding, amounted in the whole to
            fifteen hundred, the greatest Sum ever known to have been shared in one Year to that
            Time: And to the Honour of our Auditors here and elsewhere be it spoken, all this was
            rais'd without the Aid of those barbarous Entertainments with which, some few Years
            after (upon the Re-establishment of two contending Companies) we were forc'd to disgrace
            the Stage to support it.</p>
          <p>This, therefore, is that remarkable Period when the Stage, during my Time upon it, was
            the least reproachable: And it may be worth the publick Observation (if any thing I have
            said of it can be so) that <hi rend="italic">One</hi> Stage may, as I have prov'd it has
            done, very laudably support it self by such Spectacles only as are fit to delight a
            sensible People; but the equal Prosperity of <hi rend="italic">Two</hi> Stages has
            always been of a very short Duration. If therefore the Publick should ever recover into
            the true Taste of that Time, and stick to it, the Stage must come into it, or <hi
              rend="italic">starve</hi>; as, <pb n="140" entity="DSSR_000002933_0181"/> whenever the
            general Taste is vulgar, the Stage must come down to it to <hi rend="italic"
            >live.</hi>&mdash;But I ask Pardon of the Multitude, who, in all Regulations of the
            Stage, may expect to be a little indulg'd in what they like: If therefore they <hi
              rend="italic">will</hi> have a May-pole, why, the Players must <hi rend="italic"
            >give</hi> them a May-pole; but I only speak in case they should keep an old Custom of
            changing their Minds, and by their Privilege of being in the <hi rend="italic"
            >wrong,</hi> should take a Fancy, by way of Variety, of being in the <hi rend="italic"
              >right</hi>&mdash;Then, in such a Case, what I have said may appear to have been
            no intended Design against their Liberty of judging for themselves.</p>
          <p>After our Return from <hi rend="italic">Oxford, Booth</hi> was at full Leisure to
            solicit his Admission to a Share in the Menagement, <ref target="n140-1" n="106"
            >[140.1]</ref> in which he succeeded about the Beginning of the following Winter:
            Accordingly a new License (recalling all former Licenses) was issued, wherein <hi
              rend="italic">Booth</hi>'s Name was added to those of the other Menagers. <ref
              target="n140-2" n="107">[140.2]</ref> But still there was a Difficulty in his
            Qualification to be adjusted; what Consideration <pb n="141"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0182"/> he should allow for an equal Title to our Stock of
            Cloaths, Scenes, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> without which the License was of no
            more use than the Stock was without the License; or, at least, if there were any
            Difference, the former Menagers seem'd to have the Advantage in it; the Stock being
            intirely theirs, and three Parts in four of the License; for <hi rend="italic"
            >Collier</hi>, though now but a fifth Menager, still insisted on his former Appointment
            of 700<hi rend="italic">l.</hi> a Year, which in Equity ought certainly to have been
            proportionably abated: But Court-Favour was not always measur'd by <hi rend="italic"
              >that</hi> Yard; <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi>'s Matter was soon out of the Question;
            his Pretensions were too visible to be contested; but the Affair of <hi rend="italic"
              >Booth</hi> was not so clear a Point: The Lord Chamberlain, therefore, only
            recommended it to be adjusted among our selves; which, to say the Truth, at that Time
            was a greater Indulgence than I expected. Let us see, then, how this critical Case was
            handled.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> was of Opinion, that to set a good round Value upon our
            Stock, was the only way to come near an Equivalent for the Diminution of our Shares,
            which the Admission of <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> must occasion: But <hi rend="italic"
              >Dogget</hi> insisted that he had no mind to dispose of any Part of his Property, and
            therefore would set no Price upon it at all. Though I allow'd that Both these Opinions
            might be grounded on a good deal of Equity, yet I was not sure that either of them was
            practicable; and therefore told them, that when they could Both agree which of them
            could be made so, <pb n="142" entity="DSSR_000002933_0183"/> they might rely on my
            Consent in any Shape. In the mean time I desired they would consider, that as our
            License subsisted only during Pleasure, we could not pretend that the Queen might not
            recall or alter it: But that to speak out, without mincing the matter on either Side,
            the Truth was plainly this: That <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> had a manifest Merit as an
            Actor; and as he was not supposed to be a <hi rend="italic">Whig,</hi> it was as evident
            that a good deal for that Reason a Secretary of State had taken him into his Protection,
            which I was afraid the weak Pretence of our invaded Property would not be able to
            contend with: That his having signaliz'd himself in the Character of <hi rend="italic"
              >Cato</hi> (whose Principles the <hi rend="italic">Tories</hi> had affected to have
            taken into their own Possession) was a very popular Pretence of making him free of the
            Stage, by advancing him to the Profits of it. And, as we had seen that the Stage was
            frequently treated as if it was not suppos'd to have any Property at all, this Favour
            intended to <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> was thought a right Occasion to avow that
            Opinion by disposing of its Property at Pleasure: But be that as it might, I own'd it
            was not so much my Apprehensions of what the <hi rend="italic">Court</hi> might do, that
            sway'd me into an Accommodation with <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi>, as what the <hi
              rend="italic">Town,</hi> (in whose Favour he now apparently stood) might think <hi
              rend="italic">ought</hi> to be done: That there might be more danger in contesting
            their arbitrary Will and Pleasure than in disputing this less terrible Strain of the
            Prerogative. That if <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> were only impos'd upon us from his
            Merit to the Court, we were <pb n="143" entity="DSSR_000002933_0184"/> then in the
            Condition of other Subjects: Then, indeed, Law, Right, and Possession might have a
            tolerable Tug for our Property: But as the Town would always look upon his Merit to <hi
              rend="italic">them</hi> in a stronger Light, and be Judges of it themselves, it would
            be a weak and idle Endeavour in us not to sail with the Stream, when we might possibly
            make a Merit of our cheerfully admitting him: That though his former Opposition to our
            Interest might, between Man and Man, a good deal justify our not making an earlier
            Friend of him; yet that was a Disobligation out of the Town's Regard, and consequently
            would be of no weight against so approv'd an Actor's being preferr'd. But all this
            notwithstanding, if they could both agree in a different Opinion, I would, at the Hazard
            of any Consequence, be guided by it.</p>
          <p>Here, now, will be shewn another Instance of our different Tempers: <hi rend="italic"
              >Dogget</hi> (who, in all Matters that concern'd our common Weal and Interest, little
            regarded our Opinion, and even to an Obstinacy walk'd by his own) look'd only out of
            Humour at what I had said, and, without thinking himself oblig'd to give any Reason for
            it, declar'd he would maintain his Property. <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> (who, upon the
            same Occasions, was as remarkably ductile, as when his Superiority on the Stage was in
            question he was assuming and intractable) said, for his Part, provided our Business of
            acting was not interrupted, he did not care what we did: But, in short, he was for
            playing on, come what would of it. This last Part of his Declaration <pb n="144"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0185"/> I did not dislike, and therefore I desir'd we might all
            enter into an immediate Treaty with <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi>, upon the Terms of his
            Admission. <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> still sullenly reply'd, that he had no Occasion
            to enter into any Treaty. <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> then, to soften him, propos'd
            that, if I liked it, <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> might undertake it himself. I agreed.
            No! he would not be concern'd in it. I then offer'd the same trust to <hi rend="italic"
              >Wilks,</hi> if <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> approv'd of it. <hi rend="italic"
            >Wilks</hi> said he was not good at making of Bargains, but if I was willing, he would
            rather leave it to me. <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> at this rose up and said, we might
            both do as we pleas'd, but that nothing but he Law should make him part with his
            Property&mdash;and so went out of the Room. After which he never came among us more,
            either as an Actor of Menager. <ref target="n144-1" n="108">[144.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>By his having in this abrupt manner abdicated his Post in our Government, what he left
            of it naturally devolv'd upon <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> and myself. However, this did
            not so much distress our Affair as I have Reason to believe <hi rend="italic"
            >Dogget</hi> thought it would: For though by our Indentures tripartite we could not
            dispose of his Property without his Consent; Yet those Indentures could not oblige us to
            fast because he had no Appetite; and if the Mill did not grind, we could have no Bread:
            We therefore determin'd, at any Hazard, to keep our Business still going, and that our
            safest way would be to make the best Bargain we could with <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi>;
            one Article of which was to be, That <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> should stand equally
            answerable with <pb n="145" entity="DSSR_000002933_0186"/> us to <hi rend="italic"
              >Dogget</hi> for the Consequence: To which <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> made to
            Objection, and the rest of his Agreement was to allow us Six Hundred Pounds for his
            Share in our Property, which was to be paid by such Sums as should arise form half his
            Profits of Acting, 'till the whole was discharg'd: Yet so cautious were we in this
            Affair, that this Agreement was only Verbal on our Part, tho' written and sign'd by <hi
              rend="italic">Booth</hi> as what intirely contented him: However, Bond and Judgment
            could not have made it more secure to him; for he had his Share, and was able to
            discharge the Incumbrance upon it by his Income of that Year only. Let us see what <hi
              rend="italic">Dogget</hi> did in this Affair after he had left us.</p>
          <p>Might it not be imagin'd that <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> and Myself, by having made
            this Matter easy to <hi rend="italic">Booth,</hi> should have deserv'd the Approbation
            at least, if not the Favour of the Court that had exerted so much Power to prefer him?
            But shall I be believed when I affirm that <hi rend="italic">Dogget,</hi> who had so
            strongly oppos'd the Court in his Admission to a Share, was very near getting the better
            of us both upon that Account, and for some time appeared to have more Favour there than
            either of us? Let me tell out my Story, and then think what you please of it.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Dogget,</hi> who was equally oblig'd with us to act upon the Stage,
            as to assist in the Menagement of it, tho' he had refus'd to do either, still demanded
            of us his whole Share of the Profits, without considering what Part of them <hi
              rend="italic">Booth</hi> might pretend to from our <pb n="146"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0187"/> late Concessions. After many fruitless Endeavours to
            bring him back to us, <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> join'd with us in making him an Offer
            of half a Share if he had a mind totally to quit the Stage, and make it a <hi
              rend="italic">Sinecure.</hi> No! he wanted the whole, and to sit still himself, while
            we (if we pleased) might work for him or let it alone, and none of us all, neither he
            nor we, be the better for it. What we imagin'd encourag'd him to hold us at this short
            Defiance was, that he had laid up enough to live upon without the Stage (for he was one
            of those close Oeconomists whom Prodigals call a Miser) and therefore, partly from an
            Inclination as an invincible <hi rend="italic">Whig</hi> to signalize himself in defence
            of his Property, and as much presuming that our Necessities would oblige us to come to
            his own Terms, he was determin'd (even against the Opinion of his Friends) to make no
            other Peace with us. But not being able by this inflexible Perseverance to have his
            wicked Will of us, he was resolv'd to go to the Fountain-head of his own Distress, and
            try if from thence he could turn the Current against us. He appeal'd to the
            Vice-Chamberlain, <ref target="n146-1" n="109">[146.1]</ref> to whose Direction the
            adjusting of all these Theatrical Difficulties was then committed: But there, I dare
            say, the Reader does not expect he should meet with much Favour: However, be that as it
            may; for whether any regard was had to his having some Thousands in his Pocket; or that
            he was consider'd as a Man who would or could make <pb n="147"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0188"/> more Noise in the Matter than Courtiers might care for:
            Or what Charms, Spells, or Conjurations he might make use of, is all Darkness to me; yet
            so it was, he one way or other play'd his part so well, that in a few Days after we
            received an Order from the Vice-Chamberlain, positively commanding us to pay <hi
              rend="italic">Dogget</hi> his whole Share, notwithstanding we had complain'd before of
            his having withdrawn himself from acting on the Stage, and from the Menagement of it.
            This I thought was a dainty Distinction, indeed! that <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi>'s
            Defiance of the Commands in favour of <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> should be rewarded
            with so ample a <hi rend="italic">Sine-cure,</hi> and that we for our Obedience should
            be condemn'd to dig in the Mine to pay it him! This bitter Pill, I confess, was more
            than I could down with, and therefore soon determin'd at all Events never to take it.
            But as I had a Man in Power to deal with, it was not my business to speak <hi
              rend="italic">out</hi> to him, or to set forth our Treatment in its proper Colours. My
            only Doubt was, Whether I could bring <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> into the same
            Sentiments (for he never car'd to litigate any thing that did not affect his Figure upon
            the Stage.) But I had the good Fortune to lay our Condition in so precarious and
            disagreeable a Light to him, if we submitted to this Order, that he fir'd before I could
            get thro' half the Consequences of it; and I began now to find it more difficult to keep
            him within Bounds than I had before to alarm him. I then propos'd to him this Expedient:
            That we should draw up a Remonstrance, neither seeming <pb n="148"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0189"/> to refuse or comply with this Order; but to start such
            Objections and perplexing Difficulties that should make the whole impracticable: That
            under such Distractions as this would raise in our Affairs we could not be answerable to
            keep open our Doors, which consequently would destroy the Fruit of the Favour lately
            granted to <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi>, as well as of This intended to <hi
              rend="italic">Dogget</hi> himself. To this Remonstrance we received an Answer in
            Writing, which varied something in the Measures to accommodate Matters with <hi
              rend="italic">Dogget</hi>. This was all I desir'd; when I found the Style of <hi
              rend="italic">Sic jubeo</hi> was alter'd, when this formidable Power began to <hi
              rend="italic">parley</hi> with us, we knew there could not be much to be fear'd from
            it: For I would have remonstrated 'till I had died, rather than have yielded to the
            roughest or smoothest Persuasion, that could intimidate or deceive us. By this Conduct
            we made the Affair at last too troublesome for the Ease of a Courtier to go thro's with.
            For when it was consider'd that the principal Point, the Admission of <hi rend="italic"
              >Booth</hi>, was got over, <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> was fairly left to the Law
            for Relief. <ref target="n148-1" n="110">[148.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <pb n="149" entity="DSSR_000002933_0190"/>
          <p>Upon this Disappointment <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> accordingly preferred a Bill in
              <hi rend="italic">Chancery</hi> against us. <hi rend="italic">Wilks,</hi> who hated
            all Business but that of entertaining the Publick, left the Conduct of our Cause to me;
            in which we had, at our first setting out, this Advantage of <hi rend="italic"
            >Dogget</hi>, that we had three Pockets to support our Expence, where he had but One. My
            first Direction to our Solicitor was, to use all possible Delay that the Law would admit
            of, a Direction that Lawyers seldom neglect; by this means we hung up our Plaintiff
            about two Years in <hi rend="italic">Chancery,</hi> 'till we were at full Leisure to
            come to a Hearing before the Lord-Chancellor <hi rend="italic">Cooper</hi>, which did
            not happen 'till after the Accession of his late Majesty. The Issue of it was this. <hi
              rend="italic">Dogget</hi> had about fourteen Days allow'd him to make his Election
            whether he would <pb n="150" entity="DSSR_000002933_0191"/> return to act as usual: But
            he declaring, by his Counsel, That he rather chose to quit the Stage, he was decreed Six
            Hundred Pounds for his Share in our Property, with 15 <hi rend="italic">per Cent.</hi>
            Interest from the Date of the last License: Upon the Receipt of which both Parties were
            to sign General-Releases, and severally to pay their own Costs. By this Decree, <hi
              rend="italic">Dogget</hi>, when his Lawyer's Bill was paid, scarce got one Year's
            Purchase of what we had offer'd him without Law, which (as he surviv'd but seven Years
            after it) would have been an Annuity of Five Hundred Pounds and a <hi rend="italic">Sine
              Cure</hi> for Life. <ref target="n150-1" n="111">[150.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>Tho' there are many Persons living who know every Article of these Facts to be true:
            Yet it will be found that the strongest of them was not the strongest Occasion of <hi
              rend="italic">Dogget</hi>'s quitting the Stage. If therefore the Reader should not
            have Curiosity enough to know how the Publick came to be depriv'd of so valuable an
            Actor, let him consider that he is not obliged to go through the rest of this Chapter,
            which I fairly tell him before-hand will only be fill'd up with a few idle Anecdotes
            leading to that Discovery.</p>
          <p>After our Law-suit was ended, <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> for some few Years could
            scarce bear the Sight of <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> or myself; tho' (as shall be
            shewn) for different Reasons: Yet it was his Misfortune to meet with us almost every
            Day. <hi rend="italic">Button</hi>'s Coffee-house, so celebrated in <pb n="151"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0192"/> the <hi rend="italic">Tatlers</hi> for the Good-Company
            that came there, was at this time in its highest Request. <hi rend="italic">Addison,
              Steele, Pope,</hi> and several other Gentlemen of different Merit, then made it their
            constant <hi rend="italic">Rendezvous.</hi> Nor could <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi>
            decline the agreeable Conversation there, tho' he was daily sure to find <hi
              rend="italic">Wilks</hi> or myself in the same Place to sour his Share of it: For as
              <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> and He were differently Proud, the one rejoicing in a
            captious, over-bearing, valiant Pride, and the other in a stiff, sullen, Purse-Pride, it
            may be easily conceiv'd, when two such Tempers met, how agreeable the Sight of one was
            to the other. And as <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> knew I had been the Conductor of our
            Defence against his Law-suit, which had hurt him more for the Loss he had sustain'd in
            his Reputation of understanding Business, which he valued himself upon, than his
            Disappointment had of getting so little by it; it was no wonder if I was intirely out of
            his good Graces, which I confess I was inclin'd upon any reasonable Terms to have
            recover'd; he being of all my Theatrical Brethren the Man I most delighted in: For when
            he was not in a Fit of Wisdom, or not over-concerned about his Interest, he had a great
            deal of entertaining Humour: I therefore, notwithstanding his Reserve, always left the
            Door open to our former Intimacy, if he were inclined to come into it. I never failed to
            give him my Hat and <hi rend="italic">Your Servant</hi> wherever I met him; neither of
            which he would ever return for above a Year after; but I still persisted in my usual
            Salutation, without observing <pb n="152" entity="DSSR_000002933_0193"/> whether it was
            civilly received or not. This ridiculous Silence between two Comedians, that had so
            lately liv'd in a constant Course of Raillery with one another, was often smil'd at by
            our Acquaintance who frequented the same Coffee-house: And one of them carried his Jest
            upon it so far, that when I was at some Distance from Town he wrote me a formal Account
            that <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> was actually dead. After the first Surprize his
            Letter gave me was over, I began to consider, that this coming from a droll Friend to
            both of us, might possibly be written to extract some Merriment out of my real belief of
            it: In this I was not unwilling to gratify him, and returned an Answer as if I had taken
            the Truth of his News for granted; and was not a little pleas'd that I had so fair an
            Opportunity of speaking my Mind freely of <hi rend="italic">Dogget,</hi> which I did, in
            some Favour of his Character; I excused his Faults, and was just to his Merit. His
            Law-suit with us I only imputed to his having naturally deceived himself in the Justice
            of his Cause. What I most complain'd of was, his irreconcilable Disaffection to me upon
            it, whom he could not reasonably blame for standing in my own Defence; that not to
            endure me after it was a Reflection upon his Sense, when all our Acquaintance had been
            Witnesses of our former Intimacy, which my Behaviour in his Life-time had plainly shewn
            him I had a mind to renew. But since he was now gone (however great a Churl he was to
            me) I was sorry my Correspondent had lost him.</p>
          <pb n="153" entity="DSSR_000002933_0194"/>
          <p>This Part of my Letter I was sure, if <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi>'s Eyes were still
            open, would be shewn to him; if not, I had only writ it to no Purpose. But about a Month
            after, when I came to Town, I had some little Reason to imagine it had the Effect I
            wish'd from it: For one Day, sitting over-against him at the same Coffee-house where we
            often mixt at the same Table, tho' we never exchanged a single Syllable, he graciously
            extended his Hand for a Pinch of my Snuff: As this seem'd from him a sort of breaking
            the Ice of his Temper, I took Courage upon it to break Silence on my Side, and ask'd him
            how he lik'd it? To which, with a slow Hesitation naturally assisted by the Action of
            his taking the Snuff, he reply'd&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Umh! the
              best&mdash;Umh!&mdash;I have tasted a great while!</hi>&mdash;If the
            Reader, who may possibly think all this extremely trifling, will consider that Trifles
            sometimes shew Characters in as strong a Light as Facts of more serious Importance, I am
            in hopes he may allow that my Matter less needs an Excuse than the Excuse itself does;
            if not, I must stand condemn'd at the end of my Story.&mdash;But let me go on.</p>
          <p>After a few Days of these coy, Lady-like Compliances on his Side, we grew into a more
            conversable Temper: At last I took a proper Occasion, and desired he would be so frank
            with me as to let me know what was his real Dislike, or Motive, that made him throw up
            so good an Income as his Share with us annually brought him in? For though by our
            Admission of <hi rend="italic">Booth,</hi> it might not probably amount to <pb n="154"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0195"/> so much by a Hundred or two a Year as formerly, yet the
            Remainder was too considerable to be quarrel'd with, and was likely to continue more
            than the best Actors before us had ever got by the Stage. And farther, to encourage him
            to be open, I told him, If I had done any thing that had particularly disobliged him, I
            was ready, if he could put me in the way, to make him any Amends in my Power; if not, I
            desired he would be so just to himself as to let me know the real Truth without Reserve:
            But Reserve he could not, from his natural Temper, easily shake off. All he said came
            from him by half Sentences and <hi rend="italic">Inuendos,</hi> as&mdash;No, he had
            not taken any thing particularly ill&mdash;for his Part, he was very easy as he was;
            but where others were to dispose of his Property as they pleas'd&mdash;if you had
            stood it out as I did, <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> might have paid a better Price for
            it. &mdash;You were too much afraid of the Court&mdash;but that's all
            over.&mdash;There were other things in the Playhouse. &mdash;No Man of
            Spirit.&mdash;In short, to be always pester'd and provok'd by a trifling
            Wasp&mdash;a&mdash;vain&mdash;shallow! &mdash;A Man would sooner beg his
            Bread than bear it. &mdash;(Here it was easy to understand him: I therefore ask'd
            him what he had to bear that I had not my Share of?) No! it was not the same thing, he
            said. &mdash;You can play with a Bear, or let him alone and do what he would, but I
            could not let him lay his Paws upon me without being hurt; you did not feel him as I
            did.&mdash;And for a Man to be cutting of Throats upon every Trifle at my time of
            Day!&mdash;If I had been as <pb n="155" entity="DSSR_000002933_0196"/> covetous as
            he thought me, may be I might have born it as well as you&mdash;but I would not be a
            Lord of the Treasury if such a Temper as <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>'s were to be at
            the Head of it.&mdash;</p>
          <p>Here, then, the whole Secret was out. The rest of our Conversation was but explaining
            upon it. In a Word, the painful Behaviour of <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> had hurt him
            so sorely that the Affair of <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> was look'd upon as much a
            Relief as a Grievance, in giving him so plausible a Pretence to get rid of us all with a
            better Grace.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> too, in a little time, had his Share of the same
            Uneasiness, and often complain'd of it to me: Yet as we neither of us could then afford
            to pay <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi>'s Price for our Remedy, all we could do was to
            avoid every Occasion in our Power of inflaming the Distemper: So that we both agreed,
            tho' <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>'s Nature was not to be changed, it was a less Evil to
            live with him than without him.</p>
          <p>Tho' I had often suspected, from what I had felt myself, that the Temper of <hi
              rend="italic">Wilks</hi> was <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi>'s real Quarrel to the
            Stage, yet I could never thoroughly believe it 'till I had it from his own Mouth. And I
            then thought the Concern he had shewn at it was a good deal inconsistent with that
            Understanding which was generally allow'd him. When I give my Reasons for it, perhaps
            the Reader will not have a better Opinion of my own: Be that as it may, I cannot help
            wondering that he who was so much more capable of Reflexion than <hi rend="italic"
              >Wilks,</hi> could sacrifice <pb n="156" entity="DSSR_000002933_0197"/> so valuable an
            Income to his Impatience of another's natural Frailty! And though my Stoical way of
            thinking may be no Rule for a wiser Man's Opinion, yet, if it should happen to be right,
            the Reader may make his Use of it. Why then should we not always consider that the
            Rashness of Abuse is but the false Reason of a weak Man? and that offensive Terms are
            only used to supply the want of Strength in Argument? Which, as to the common Practice
            of the sober World, we do not find every Man in Business is oblig'd to resent with a
            military Sense of Honour: Or if he should, would not the Conclusion amount to this?
            Because another wants Sense and Manners I am obliged to be a Madman: For such every Man
            is, more or less, while the Passion of Anger is in Possession of him. And what less can
            we call that proud Man who would put another out of the World only for putting him out
            of Humour? If Accounts of the Tongue were always to be made up with the Sword, all the
            Wisemen in the World might be brought in Debtors to Blockheads. And when Honour pretends
            to be Witness, Judge, and Executioner in its own Cause, if Honour were a Man, would it
            be an Untruth to say Honour is a very impudent Fellow? But in <hi rend="italic"
            >Dogget</hi>'s Case it may be ask'd, How was he to behave himself? Were passionate
            Insults to be born for Years together? To these Questions I can only answer with two or
            three more, Was he to punish himself because another was in the wrong? How many sensible
            Husbands endure <pb n="157" entity="DSSR_000002933_0198"/> the teizing Tongue of a
            froward Wife only because she is the weaker Vessel? And why should not a weak Man have
            the same Indulgence? Daily Experience will tell us that the fretful Temper of a Friend,
            like the Personal Beauty of a fine Lady, by Use and Cohabitation may be brought down to
            give us neither Pain nor Pleasure. Such, at least, and no more, was the Distress I found
            myself in upon the same Provocations, which I generally return'd with humming an Air to
            myself; or if the Storm grew very high, it might perhaps sometimes ruffle me enough to
            sing a little out of Tune. Thus too (if I had any ill Nature to gratify) I often saw the
            unruly Passion of the Aggressor's Mind punish itself by a restless Disorder of the Body.</p>
          <p>What inclines me, therefore, to think the Conduct of <hi rend="italic">Dogget</hi> was
            as rash as the Provocations he complain'd of, is that in some time after he had left us
            he plainly discover'd he had repented it. His Acquaintance observ'd to us, that he sent
            many a long Look after his Share in the still prosperous State of the Stage: But as his
            Heart was too high to declare (what we saw too) his shy Inclination to return, he made
            us no direct Overtures. Nor, indeed, did we care (though he was a golden Actor) to pay
            too dear for him: For as most of his Parts had been pretty well supply'd, he could not
            now be of his former Value to us. However, to shew the Town at least that he had not
            forsworn the Stage, he one Day condescended <pb n="158" entity="DSSR_000002933_0199"/>
            to play for the Benefit of Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Porter,</hi>
            <ref target="n158-1" n="112">[158.1]</ref> in the <hi rend="italic">Wanton Wife,</hi> at
            which he knew his late Majesty was to be present. <ref target="n158-2" n="113"
            >[158.2]</ref> Now (tho' I speak it not of my own Knowledge) yet it was not likely Mrs.
              <hi rend="italic">Porter</hi> would have ask'd that Favour of him without some
            previous Hint that it would be granted. His coming among us for that Day only had a
            strong Appearance of his laying it in our way to make him Proposals, or that he hoped
            the Court or Town might intimate to us their Desire of seeing him oftener: But as he
            acted only to do a particular Favour, the Menagers ow'd him no Compliment for it beyond
            Common Civilities. And, as that might not be all he proposed by it, his farther Views
            (if he had any) came to nothing. For after this Attempt he never returned to the Stage.</p>
          <p>To speak of him as an Actor: He was the most an Original, and the strictest Observer of
            Nature, of all his Contemporaries. <ref target="n158-3" n="114">[158.3]</ref> He
            borrow'd from none of them: His Manner was his own: He was a Pattern <pb n="159"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0200"/> to others, whose greatest Merit was that they had
            sometimes tolerably imitated him. In dressing a Character to the greatest Exactness he
            was remarkably skilful; the least Article of whatever Habit he wore seem'd in some
            degree to speak and mark the different Humour he presented; a necessary Care in a
            Comedian, in which many have been too remiss or ignorant. He could be extremely
            ridiculous without stepping into the least Impropriety to make him so. His greatest
            Success was in Characters of lower Life, which he improv'd form the Delight he took in
            his Observations of that Kind in the real World. In Songs, and particular Dances, too,
            of Humour, he had no Competitor. <hi rend="italic">Congreve</hi> was a great Admirer of
            him, and found his Account in the Characters he expresly wrote for him. In those of <hi
              rend="italic">Fondlewife,</hi> in his <hi rend="italic">Old Batchelor,</hi> and <hi
              rend="italic">Ben,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Love for Love,</hi> no Author and Actor
            could be more obliged to their mutual masterly Performances. He was very acceptable to
            several Persons of high Rank and Taste: Tho' he seldom car'd to be the Comedian but
            among his more intimate Acquaintance.</p>
          <p>And now let me ask the World a Question. When Men have any valuable Qualities, why are
            the generality of our modern Wits so fond of exposing their Failings only, which the
            wisest of Mankind will never wholly be free from? Is it of more use to the Publick to
            know their Errors than their Perfections? Why is the Account of Life to be so unequally
            stated? Though a Man may be sometimes <pb n="160" entity="DSSR_000002933_0201"/> Debtor
            to Sense or Morality, is it not doing him Wrong not to let the World see, at the same
            time, how far he may be Creditor to both? Are Defects and Disproportions to be the only
            labour'd Features in a Portrait? But perhaps such Authors may know how to please the
            World better than I do, and may naturally suppose that what is delightful to themselves
            may not be disagreeable to other. For my own part, I confess myself a little touch'd in
            Conscience at what I have just now observ'd to the Disadvantage of my other
            Brother-Menager.</p>
          <p>If, therefore, in discovering the true Cause of the Publick's losing so valuable an
            Actor as <hi rend="italic">Dogget,</hi> I have been obliged to shew the Temper of <hi
              rend="italic">Wilks</hi> in its natural Complexion, ought I not, in amends and Balance
            of his Imperfections, to say at the same time of him, That if he was not the most
            Correct or Judicious, yet (as <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> says of the King his Father)
              <hi rend="italic">Take him</hi> for <hi rend="italic">All in All,</hi> &amp;c. he
            was certainly the most diligent, most laborious, and most useful Actor that I have seen
            upon the Stage in Fifty Years. <ref target="n160-1" n="115">[160.1]</ref>

            <p> "The Laureat" says these Irish actors were Elrington and Griffith, but I venture to
              think that Evans's name should be substituted for that of Griffith. All three came
              from Ireland to Drury Lane in 1714; but, while Elrington and Evans played many
              important characters, Griffith did very little. Again, I can find no record of the

            <p> The dates regarding this quarrel with Dogget are very difficult to fix
              satisfactorily. In the collection of Mr. Francis Harvey of St. James Street are some
              valuable letters by Dogget in connection with this matter. From these, and from Mr.
              Percy Fitzgerald's "New History" (i. 352-358), I have made up a list of dates, which,
              however, I give with all reserve. We know from "The Laureat" that Dogget had some
              funds of the theatre in his hands when he ceased acting, and this fact makes a
              Petition by Cibber and Wilks, that he should account with them for money,
              intelligible. This is dated 16th January, 1714&mdash;it cannot be 1713, as Mr.
              Fitzgerald says, for Booth was not admitted then, and the quarrel had not arisen. Then
              follows a Petition from Cibber, Booth, and Wilks, dated 5th February, 1714, praying
              the Chamberlain to settle the dispute. Petitions by Dogget bear date 17th April, 1714;
              and, I think, 14th June, 1714. Mr. Fitzgerald gives this latter date as 14th January,
              1714, and certainly the date on the document itself is more like "Jan" than "June;"
              but in the course of the Petition Dogget says that the season will end in a few days,
              which seems to fix June as the correct month. The season 1713-14 ended 18th June,
              1714. Next comes a Petition that Dogget should be compelled to act if he was to draw
              his share of the profits, which is dated 3rd November, 1714. In this case we are on
              sure ground, for the Petition is preserved among the Lord Chamberlain's Papers.
              Another Petition by Dogget, in which he talks of his being forced into Westminster
              Hall to obtain his rights, is dated "Jan. ye 6 1714," that is, 1715. After this, legal
              action was no doubt commenced, as related by Cibber.</p>

              rebuilt. The Patent restored. Eight Actors at once desert from the King's Company.
              Why. A new Patent obtain'd by Sir</hi> Richard Steele, <hi rend="italic">and assign'd
              in Shares to the menaging Actors of</hi> Drury-Lane. <hi rend="italic">Of modern
              Pantomimes. The Rise of them. Vanity invincible and asham'd. The</hi> Non-juror <hi
              rend="italic">acted. The Author not forgiven, and rewarded for it.</hi></p>

          <p>UPON the Death of the Queen, Plays (as they always had been on the like Occasions) were
            silenc'd for six Weeks. But this happening on the first of <hi rend="italic">August,</hi>
            <ref target="n161-1" n="116">[161.1]</ref> in the long Vacation of the Theatre, the
            Observance of that Ceremony, which at another <pb n="162" entity="DSSR_000002933_0203"/>
            Juncture would have fallen like wet Weather upon their Harvest, did them now no
            particular Damage. Their License, however, being of course to be renewed, that Vacation
            gave the Menagers Time to cast about for the better Alteration of it: And since they
            knew the Pension of seven hundred a Year, which had been levied upon them for <hi
              rend="italic">Collier,</hi> must still be paid to somebody, they imagined the Merit of
            a <hi rend="italic">Whig</hi> might now have as good a Chance for getting into it, as
            that of a <hi rend="italic">Tory</hi> had for being continued in it: Having no
            Obligations, therefore, to <hi rend="italic">Collier,</hi> who had made the last Penny
            of them, they apply'd themselves to Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard Steele,</hi> who had
            distinguished himself by his Zeal for the House of <hi rend="italic">Hanover</hi>, and
            had been expell'd the House of Commons for carrying it (as was judg'd at a certain
            Crisis) into a Reproach of the Government. This we knew was his Pretension to that
            Favour in which he now stood at Court: We knew, too, the Obligations the Stage had to
            his Writings; there being scarce a Comedian of Merit in our whole Company whom his <hi
              rend="italic">Tatlers</hi> had not made better by his publick Recommendation of them.
            And many Days had our House been particularly fill'd by the Influence and Credit of his
            Pen. Obligations of this kind from a Gentleman with whom they all had the Pleasure of a
            personal Intimacy, the Menagers thought could not be more justly return'd than by
            shewing him some warm Instance of their Desire to have him at the Head of them. We
            therefore beg'd him to use <pb n="163" entity="DSSR_000002933_0204"/> his Interest for
            the Renewal of our License, and that he would do us the Honour of getting our Names to
            stand with His in the same Commission. This, we told him, would put it still farther
            into his Power of supporting the Stage in that Reputation, to which his Lucubrations had
            already so much contributed; and that therefore we thought no Man had better Pretences
            to partake of its Success. <ref target="n163-1" n="117">[163.1]</ref>
          </p>
          <pb n="164" entity="DSSR_000002933_0205"/>
          <p>Though it may be no Addition to the favourable Part of this Gentleman's Character to
            say with what Pleasure he receiv'd this Mark of our Inclination to him, yet my Vanity
            longs to tell you that it surpriz'd him into an Acknowledgment that People who are shy
            of Obligations are cautious of confessing. His Spirits took such a lively turn upon it,
            that had we been all his own Sons, no unexpected Act of filial Duty could have more
            endear'd us to him.</p>
          <p>It must be observ'd, then, that as <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi> had no Share in any
            Part of our Property, no Difficulties from that Quarter could obstruct this Proposal.
            And the usual Time of our beginning to act for the Winter-Season now drawing near, we
            press'd him not to lose any Time in his Solicitation of this new License. Accordingly
            Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi> apply'd himself to the Duke of <hi rend="italic"
              >Marlborough,</hi> the Hero of his Heart, who, upon the first mention of it, obtain'd
            it of his Majesty for Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi> and the former Menagers <pb
              n="165" entity="DSSR_000002933_0206"/> who were Actors. <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi>
            we heard no more of. <ref target="n165-1" n="118">[165.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>The Court and Town being crowded very early in the Winter-Season, upon the critical
            Turn of Affairs so much expected from the <hi rend="italic">Hanover</hi> Succession, the
            Theatre had its particular Share of that general Blessing by a more than ordinary
            Concourse of Spectators. </p>
          <p>About this Time the Patentee, having very near finish'd his House in <hi rend="italic"
              >Lincoln's-Inn Fields</hi>, began to think of forming a new Company; and in the mean
            time found it necessary to apply for Leave to employ them. By the weak Defence he had
            always made against the several Attacks upon his Interest and former Government of the
            Theatre, it might be a Question, if his House had been ready in the Queen's Time,
            whether he would then have had the Spirit to ask, or Interest enough to obtain Leave to
            use it: But in the following Reign, as it did not appear he had done anything to forfeit
            the Right of his Patent, he prevail'd with Mr. <hi rend="italic">Craggs</hi> the Younger
            (afterwards Secretary of State) to lay his Case before the King, which he did in so
            effectual a manner that (as Mr. <hi rend="italic">Craggs</hi> himself told me) his
            Majesty was pleas'd to say upon it, "That he remember'd when he had "been in <hi
              rend="italic">England</hi> before, in King <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi> his Time,
              <pb n="166" entity="DSSR_000002933_0207"/> "there had been two Theatres in <hi
              rend="italic">London</hi>; and as "the Patent seem'd to be a lawful Grant, he saw no
            "Reason why Two Play-houses might not be continued." <ref target="n166-1" n="119"
              >[166.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>The Suspension of the Patent being thus taken off, the younger Multitude seem'd to call
            aloud for two Play-houses! Many desired another, from the common Notion that <hi
              rend="italic">Two</hi> would always create Emulation in the Actors (an Opinion which I
            have consider'd in a former Chapter). Others, too, were as eager for them, from the
            natural Ill-will that follows the Fortunate or Prosperous in any Undertaking. Of this
            low Malevolence we had, now and then, had remarkable Instances; we had been forced to
            dismiss an Audience of a hundred and fifty Pounds, from a Disturbance spirited up by
            obscure People, who never gave any better Reason for it, than that it was their Fancy to
            support the idle Complaint of one rival Actress against another, in their several
            Pretensions to the chief Part in a new Tragedy. But as this Tumult seem'd only to be the
            Wantonness of <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Liberty, I shall not presume to lay any
            farther Censure upon it. <ref target="n166-2" n="120">[166.2]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>Now, notwithstanding this publick Desire of re-establishing <pb n="167"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0208"/> two Houses; and though I have allow'd the former Actors
            greatly our Superiors; and the Menagers I am speaking of not to have been without their
            private Errors: Yet under all these Disadvantages, it is certain the Stage, for twenty
            Years before this time, had never been in so flourishing a Condition: And it was as
            evident to all sensible Spectators that this Prosperity could be only owing to that
            better Order and closer Industry now daily observ'd, and which had formerly been
            neglected by our Predecessors. But that I may not impose upon the Reader a Merit which
            was not generally allow'd us, I ought honestly to let him know, that about this time the
            publick Papers, particularly <hi rend="italic">Mist</hi>'s Journal, took upon them very
            often to censure our Menagement, with the same Freedom and Severity as if we had been so
            many Ministers of State: But so it happen'd, that these unfortunate Reformers of the
            World, these self-appointed <hi rend="italic">Censors,</hi> hardly ever hit upon what
            was really wrong in us; but taking up Facts upon Trust, or Hear-say, piled up many a
            pompous Paragraph that they had ingeniously conceiv'd was sufficient to demolish our
            Administration, or at least to make us very uneasy in it; which, indeed, had so far its
            Effect, that my equally-injur'd Brethren, <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> and <hi
              rend="italic">Booth</hi>, often complain'd to me of these disagreeable Aspersions, and
            propos'd that some publick Answer might be made to them, which <pb n="168"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0209"/> I always oppos'd by, perhaps, too secure a Contempt of
            what such Writers could do to hurt us; and my Reason for it was, that I knew but of one
            way to silence Authors of that Stamp; which was, to grow insignificant and good for
            nothing, and then we should hear no more of them: But while we continued in the
            Prosperity of pleasing others, and were not conscious of having deserv'd what they said
            of us, why should we gratify the little Spleen of our Enemies by wincing at it, <ref
              target="n168-1" n="121">[168.1]</ref> or give them fresh Opportunities to dine upon
            any Reply they might make to our publickly taking Notice of them? And though Silence
            might in some Cases be a sign of Guilt or Error confess'd, our Accusers were so low in
            their Credit and Sense, that the Content we gave the Publick almost every Day from the
            Stage ought to be our only Answer to them.</p>
          <p>However (as I have observ'd) we made many Blots, which these unskilful Gamesters never
            hit: But the Fidelity of an Historian cannot be excus'd the Omission of any Truth which
            might make for the other Side of the Question. I shall therefore <pb n="169"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0210"/> confess a Fact, which, if a happy Accident had not
            intervened, had brought our Affairs into a very tottering Condition. This, too, is that
            Fact which in a former Chapter I promis'd to set forth as a Sea-Mark of Danger to future
            Menagers in their Theatrical Course of Government. <ref target="n169-1" n="122"
            >[169.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>When the new-built Theatre in <hi rend="italic">Lincoln's-Inn Fields</hi> was ready to
            be open'd, seven or eight Actors in one Day deserted from us to the Service of the
            Enemy, <ref target="n169-2" n="123">[169.2]</ref> which oblig'd us to postpone many of
            our best Plays for want of some inferior Part in them which these Deserters had been
            used to fill: But the Indulgence of the Royal Family, who then frequently honour'd us by
            their Presence, was pleas'd to accept of whatever could be hastily got ready for their
            Entertainment. And tho' this critical good Fortune prevented, in some measure, our
            Audiences falling so low as otherwise they might have done, yet it was not sufficient to
            keep us in our former Prosperity: For that Year our Profits amounted not to above a
            third Part of our usual Dividends; tho' in the following Year we intirely recover'd
            them. The Chief of these Deserters were <hi rend="italic">Keene, Bullock, Pack,</hi>
            <ref target="n169-3" n="124">[169.3]</ref>
            <hi rend="italic">Leigh</hi>, Son of the <pb n="170" entity="DSSR_000002933_0211"/>
            famous <hi rend="italic">Tony Leigh</hi>, <ref target="n170-1" n="125">[170.1]</ref> and
            others of less note. 'Tis true, they none of them had more than a negative Merit, in
            being only able to do us more Harm by their leaving us without Notice, than they could
            do us Good by remaining with us: For though the best of them could not support a Play,
            the worst of them by their Absence could maim it; as the Loss of the least Pin in a
            Watch may obstruct its Motion. But to come to the true Cause of their Desertion: After
            my having discover'd the (long unknown) Occasion that drove <hi rend="italic"
            >Dogget</hi> from the Stage before his settled Inclination to leave it, it will be less
            incredible that these Actors, upon the first Opportunity to relieve themselves, should
            all in one Day have left us from the same Cause of Uneasiness. For, in a little time
            after, upon not finding their Expectations answer'd in <hi rend="italic">Lincoln's-Inn
              Fields</hi>, some of them, who seem'd <pb n="171" entity="DSSR_000002933_0212"/> to
            answer for the rest, told me the greatest Grievance they had in our Company was the
            shocking Temper of <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>, who, upon every, almost no Occasion,
            let loose the unlimited Language of Passion upon them n such a manner as their Patience
            was not longer able to support. This, indeed, was what we could not justify! This was a
            Secret that might have made a wholesome Paragraph in a critical News-Paper! But as it
            was our good Fortune that it came not to the Ears of our Enemies, the Town was not
            entertain'd with their publick Remarks upon it. <ref target="n171-1" n="126"
            >[171.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>After this new Theatre had enjoy'd that short Run of Favour which is apt to follow
            Novelty, their Audiences began to flag: But whatever good Opinion <pb n="172"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0213"/> we had of our own Merit, we had not so good a one of
            the Multitude as to depend too much upon the Delicacy of their Taste: We knew, too, that
            this Company, being so much nearer to the City than we were, would intercept many an
            honest Customer that might not know a good Market from a bad one; and that the thinnest
            of their Audiences must be always taking something from the Measure of our Profits. All
            these Disadvantages, with many others, we were forced to lay before Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Richard Steele,</hi> and farther to remonstrate to him, that as he now
            stood in <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi>'s Place, his Pension of 700<hi rend="italic"
            >l.</hi> was liable to the same Conditions that <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi> had
            receiv'd it upon; which were, that it should be only payable during our being the only
            Company permitted to act, but in case another should be set up against us, that then
            this Pension was to be liquidated into an equal Share with us; and which we now hoped he
            would be contented with. While we were offering to proceed, Sir <hi rend="italic"
              >Richard</hi> stopt us short by assuring us, that as he came among us by our own
            Invitation, he should always think himself oblig'd to come into any Measures for our
            Ease and Service: That to be a Burthen to our Industry would be more disagreeable to him
            than it could be to us; and as he had always taken a Delight in his Endeavours for our
            Prosperity, he should be still ready on our own Terms to continue them. Every one who
            knew Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard Steele</hi> in his Prosperity (before the Effects of
            his Good-nature had brought him to Distresses) knew that this was <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0214"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0215"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0216"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0217"/>
            <pb n="173" entity="DSSR_000002933_0218"/> his manner of dealing with his Friends in
            Business: Another Instance of the same nature will immediately fall in my way.</p>
          <p>When we proposed to put this Agreement into Writing, he desired us not to hurry
            ourselves; for that he was advised, upon the late Desertion of our Actors, to get our
            License (which only subsisted during Pleasure) enlarg'd into a more ample and durable
            Authority, and which he said he had Reason to think would be more easily obtain'd, if we
            were willing that a Patent for the same Purpose might be granted to him only, for his
            Life and three Years after, which he would then assign over to us. This was a Prospect
            beyond our Hopes; and what we had long wish'd for; for though I cannot say we had ever
            Reason to grieve at the Personal Severities or Behaviour of any one Lord-Chamberlain in
            my Time, yet the several Officers under them who had not the Hearts of Noblemen, often
            treated us (to use <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi>'s Expression) with all the <hi
              rend="italic">Insolence</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Office</hi> that narrow Minds are
            apt to be elated with; but a Patent, we knew, would free us from so abject a State of
            Dependency. Accordingly, we desired Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi> to lose no time;
            he was immediately promised it: In the Interim, we sounded the Inclination of the Actors
            remaining with us; who had all Sense enough to know, that the Credit and Reputation we
            stood in with the Town, could not but be a better Security for their Sallaries, than the
            Promise of any other Stage put into Bonds could <pb n="174" entity="DSSR_000002933_0219"
            /> make good to them. In a few Days after, Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi> told us,
            that his Majesty being apprised that others had a joint Power with him in the License,
            it was expected we should, under our Hands, signify that his Petition for a Patent was
            preferr'd by the Consent of us all. Such an Acknowledgment was immediately sign'd, and
            the Patent thereupon pass'd the Great Seal; for which I remember the Lord Chancellor <hi
              rend="italic">Cooper</hi>, in Compliment to Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard,</hi> would
            receive no Fee.</p>
          <p>We receiv'd the Patent <hi rend="italic">January</hi> 19, 1715, <ref target="n174-1"
              n="127">[174.1]</ref> and (Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi> being obliged the next
            Morning to set out for <hi rend="italic">Burrowbridge</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
              >Yorkshire,</hi> where he was soon after elected Member of Parliament) we were forced
            that very Night to draw up in a hurry ('till our Counsel might more adviseably perfect
            it) his Assignment to us of equal Shares in the Patent, with farther Conditions of
            Partnership: <ref target="n174-2" n="128">[174.2]</ref> But here I ought to take Shame
            to myself, and at the same time to give this second Instance of the Equity and Honour of
            Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard:</hi> For this Assignment (which I had myself the hasty
            Penning of) was so worded, that it gave Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi> as equal a
            Title to our Property <pb n="175" entity="DSSR_000002933_0220"/> as it had given us to
            his Authority in the Patent: But Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi>, notwithstanding,
            when he return'd to Town, took no Advantage of the Mistake, and consented in our second
            Agreement to pay us Twelve Hundred Pounds to be equally intitled to our Property, which
            at his Death we were obliged to repay (as we afterwards did) to his Executors; and
            which, in case any of us had died before him, the Survivors were equally obliged to have
            paid to the Executors of such deceased Person upon the same Account. But Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Richard</hi>'s Moderation with us was rewarded with the Reverse of <hi
              rend="italic">Collier</hi>'s Stiffness: <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi>, by insisting
            on his Pension, lost Three Hundred Pounds a Year; and Sir <hi rend="italic"
            >Richard,</hi> by his accepting a Share in lieu of it, was, one Year with another, as
            much a Gainer.</p>
          <p>The Grant of this Patent having assured us of a competent Term to be relied on, we were
            now emboldened to lay out larger Sums in the Decorations of our Plays: <ref
              target="n175-1" n="129">[175.1]</ref> Upon the Revival of <hi rend="italic"
            >Dryden</hi>'s <hi rend="italic">All for Love,</hi> the Habits of that Tragedy amounted
            to an Expence of near Six Hundred Pounds; a Sum unheard of, for many Years before, on
            the like Occasions. <pb n="176" entity="DSSR_000002933_0221"/>
            <ref target="n176-1" n="130">[176.1]</ref> But we thought such extraordinary Marks of
            our Acknowledgment were due to the Favours which the Publick were now again pouring in
            upon us. About this time we were so much in fashion, and follow'd, that our Enemies (who
            they were it would not be fair to guess, for we never knew them) made their Push of a
            good round Lye upon us, to terrify those Auditors from our Support whom they could not
            mislead by their private Arts or publick Invectives. A current Report that the Walls and
            Roof of our House were liable to fall, had got such Ground in the Town, that on a sudden
            we found our Audiences unusually decreased by it: <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> was
            immediately for denouncing War and Vengeance on the Author of this Falshood, and for
            offering a Reward to whoever could discover him. But it was thought more necessary first
            to disprove the Falshood, and then to pay what Compliments might be thought <pb n="177"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0222"/> adviseable to the Author. Accordingly an Order from the
            King was obtained, to have our Tenement surveyed by Sir <hi rend="italic">Thomas
            Hewet,</hi> then the proper Officer; whose Report of its being in a safe and sound
            Condition, and sign'd by him, was publish'd in every News-Paper. <ref target="n177-1"
              n="131">[177.1]</ref> This had so immediate an Effect, that our Spectators, whose
            Apprehensions had lately kept them absent, now made up our Losses by returning to us
            with a fresh Inclination and in greater Numbers.</p>
          <p>When it was first publickly known that the New <pb n="178" entity="DSSR_000002933_0223"
            /> Theatre would be open'd against us; I cannot help going a little back to remember the
            Concern that my Brother-Menagers express'd at what might be the Consequences of it. The
            imagined that now all those who wish'd Ill to us, and particularly a great Party who had
            been disobliged by our shutting them out from behind our Scenes, even to the Refusal of
            their Money, <ref target="n178-1" n="132">[178.1]</ref> would now exert themselves in
            any partial or extravagant Measures that might either hurt us or support our
            Competitors: These, too, were some of those farther Reasons which had discouraged them
            from running the hazard of continuing to Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard Steele</hi> the
            same Pension which had been paid to <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi>. Upon all which I
            observed to them, that, for my own Part, I had not the same Apprehensions; but that I
            foresaw as many good as bad Consequences from two Houses: That tho' the Novelty might
            possibly at first abate a little of our Profits; yet, if we slacken'd not our Industry,
            that Loss would be amply balanced by an equal Increase of our East and Quiet: That those
            turbulent Spirits which were always molesting us, would now have other Employment: That
            those turbulent Spirits which were always molesting us, would now have other Employment:
            That the question'd Merit of our Acting would now stand in a clearer Light when others
            were faintly compared to us: That though Faults might be found with the best Actors that
            ever were, yet the egregious Defects that would appear in others would now be the
            effectual means to make our Superiority shine, if we had any Pretence to it: And <pb
              n="179" entity="DSSR_000002933_0224"/> that what some People hoped might ruin us,
            would in the end reduce them to give up the Dispute, and reconcile them to those who
            could best entertain them.</p>
          <p>In every Article of this Opinion they afterwards found I had not been deceived; and the
            Truth of it may be so well remember'd by many living Spectators, that it would be too
            frivolous and needless a Boast to give it any farther Observation.</p>
          <p>But in what I have said I would not be understood to be an Advocate for two
            Play-houses: For we shall soon find that two Sets of Actors tolerated in the same Place
            have constantly ended in the Corruption of the Theatre; of which the auxiliary
            Entertainments that have so barbarously supply'd the Defects of weak Action have, for
            some Years past, been a flagrant Instance; it may not, therefore, be here improper to
            shew how our childish Pantomimes first came to take so gross a Possession of the Stage.</p>
          <p>I have upon several occasions already observ'd, that when one Company is too hard for
            another, the lower in Reputation has always been forced to exhibit some new-fangled
            Foppery to draw the Multitude after them: Of these Expedients, Singing and Dancing had
            formerly been the most effectual; <ref target="n179-1" n="133">[179.1]</ref> but, at the
            Time I am speaking of, our <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Musick had <pb n="180"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0225"/> been so discountenanced since the Taste of <hi
              rend="italic">Italian</hi> Operas prevail'd, that it was to no purpose to pretend to
            it. <ref target="n180-1" n="134">[180.1]</ref> Dancing therefore was now the only Weight
            in the opposite Scale, and as the Ne Theatre sometimes found their Account in it, it
            could not be safe for us wholly to neglect it. To give even Dancing therefore some
            Improvement, and to make it something more than Motion without Meaning, the Fable of <hi
              rend="italic">Mars</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Venus</hi>
            <ref target="n180-2" n="135">[180.2]</ref> was form'd into a connected Presentation of
            Dances in Character, wherein the Passions were so happily expressed, and the whole Story
            so intelligibly told by a mute Narration of Gesture only, that even thinking Spectators
            allow'd it both a pleasing and a rational Entertainment; though, at the same time, from
            our Distrust of its Reception, we durst not venture to decorate it with any
            extraordinary Expence of Scenes or Habits; but upon the Success of this Attempt it was
            rightly concluded, that if a visible Expence in both were added to something of the same
            Nature, it could not fail of drawing the Town proportionably after it. From this
            original Hint then (but every way unequal to it) sprung forth that Succession of
            monstrous Medlies that have so long infested the Stage, and which arose upon one another
            alternately, at both Houses <pb n="181" entity="DSSR_000002933_0226"/> outvying in
            Expence, like contending Bribes on both sides at an Election, to secure a Majority of
            the Multitude. But so it is, Truth may complain and Merit murmur with what Justice it
            may, the Few will never be a Match for the Many, unless Authority should think fit to
            interpose and put down these Poetical Drams, these Gin-shops of the Stage, that
            intoxicate its Auditors and dishonour their Understanding with a Levity for which I want
            a Name. <ref target="n181-1" n="136">[181.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>If I am ask'd (after my condemning these Fooleries myself) how I came to assent or
            continue my Share of Expence to them? I have no better Excuse for <pb n="182"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0227"/> my Error than confessing it. I did it against my
            Conscience! and had not Virtue enough to starve by opposing a Multitude that would have
            been too hard for me. <ref target="n182-1" n="137">[182.1]</ref> Now let me ask an odd
            Question: Had <hi rend="italic">Harry the Fourth</hi> of <hi rend="italic">France</hi> a
            better Excuse for changing his Religion? <ref target="n182-2" n="138">[182.2]</ref> I
            was still, in my Heart, as much as he could be, on the side of Truth and Sense, but with
            this difference, that I had their leave to quit them when they could not support me: For
            what Equivalent could I have found for my falling a Martyr to them? How far the Heroe or
            the Comedian was in the wrong, let the Clergy and the Criticks decide. Necessity will be
            as good a Plea for the one as the other. But let the Question go which way it will, <hi
              rend="italic">Harry</hi> IV. has always been allow'd a great Man: And what I want of
            his Grandeur, you see by the Inference, Nature has amply supply'd to me in Vanity; a
            Pleasure which neither the Pertness of Wit or the Gravity of Wisdom will ever persuade
            me to part with. And why is there not as <pb n="183" entity="DSSR_000002933_0228"/> much
            Honesty in owning as in concealing it? For though to hide it may be Wisdom, to be
            without it is impossible; and where is the Merit of keeping a Secret which every Body is
            let into? To say we have no Vanity, then, is shewing a great deal of it; as to say we
              <hi rend="italic">have</hi> a great deal cannot be shewing so much: And tho' there may
            be Art in a Man's accusing himself, even then it will be more pardonable than
            Self-commendation. Do not we find that even good Actions have their Share of it? that it
            is as inseparable from our Being as our Nakedness? And though it may be equally decent
            to cover it, yet the wisest Man can no more b without it, than the weakest can believe
            he was born in his Cloaths. If then what we say of ourselves be true, and not
            prejudicial to others, to be called vain upon it is no more a Reproach than to be called
            a brown or a fair Man. Vanity is of all Complexions; 'tis the growth of every Clime and
            Capacity; Authors of all Ages have had a Tincture of it; and yet you read <hi
              rend="italic">Horace, Montaign,</hi> and Sir <hi rend="italic">William Temple,</hi>
            with Pleasure. Nor am I sure, if it were curable by Precept, that Mankind would be
            mended by it! Could Vanity be eradicated from our Nature, I am afraid that the Reward of
            most human Virtues would not be found in this World! And happy is he who has no greater
            Sin to answer for in the next</p>
          <p>But what is all this to the Theatrical Follies I was talking of? Perhaps not a great
            deal; but it is to my Purpose; for though I am an Historian, I do not <pb n="184"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0229"/> write to the Wise and Learned only; I hope to have
            Readers of no more Judgment than some of my <hi rend="italic">quondam</hi> Auditors; and
            I am afraid they will be as hardly contented with dry Matters of Fact, as with a plain
            Play without Entertainments: This Rhapsody, therefore, has been thrown in as a Dance
            between the Acts, to make up for the Dullness of what would have been by itself only
            proper. But I now come to my Story again.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding, then, this our Compliance with the vulgar Taste, we generally made use
            of these Pantomimes but as Crutches to our weakest Plays: Nor were we so lost to all
            Sense of what was valuable as to dishonour our best Authors in such bad Company: We had
            still a due Respect to several select Plays that were able to be their own Support; and
            in which we found our constant Account, without painting and patching them out, like
            Prostitutes, with these Follies in fashion: If therefore we were not so strictly chaste
            in the other part of our Conduct, let the Error of it stand among the silly Consequences
            of Two Stages. Could the Interest of both Companies have been united in one only
            Theatre, I had been one of the Few that would have us'd my utmost Endeavour of never
            admitting to the Stage any Spectacle that ought not to have been seen there; the Errors
            of my own Plays, which I could not see, excepted. And though probably the Majority of
            Spectators would not have been so well pleas'd with a Theatre so regulated; yet Sense
            and Reason cannot <pb n="185" entity="DSSR_000002933_0230"/> lose their intrinsick Value
            because the Giddy and the Ignorant are blind and deaf, or numerous; and I cannot help
            saying, it is a Reproach to a sensible People to let Folly so publickly govern their
            Pleasures.</p>
          <p>While I am making this grave Declaration of what I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> have
            done had One only Stage been continued; to obtain an easier Belief of my Sincerity I
            ought to put my Reader in mind of what I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> do, even after Two
            Companies were again establish'd.</p>
          <p>About this Time <hi rend="italic">Jacobitism</hi> had lately exerted itself by the most
            unprovoked Rebellion that our Histories have handed down to us since the <hi
              rend="italic">Norman</hi> Conquest: <ref target="n185-1" n="139">[185.1]</ref> I
            therefore thought that to set the Authors and Principles of that desperate Folly in a
            fair Light, by allowing the mistaken Consciences of some their best Excuse, and by
            making the artful Pretenders to Conscience as ridiculous as they were ungratefully
            wicked, was a Subject fit for the honest Satire of Comedy, and what might, if it
            succeeded, do Honour to the Stage by shewing the valuable Use of it. <ref
              target="n185-2" n="140">[185.2]</ref> And considering what Numbers at that <pb n="186"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0231"/> time might come to it as prejudic'd Spectators, it may
            be allow'd that the Undertaking was not less hazardous than laudable.</p>
          <p>To give Life, therefore, to this Design, I borrow'd the <hi rend="italic">Tartuffe</hi>
            of <hi rend="italic">Moliere,</hi> and turn'd him into a modern <hi rend="italic"
              >Nonjuror:</hi>
            <ref target="n186-1" n="141">[186.1]</ref> Upon the Hypocrisy of the <hi rend="italic"
              >French</hi> Character I ingrafted a stronger Wickedness, that of an <hi rend="italic"
              >English</hi> Popish Priest lurking under the Doctrine of our own Church to raise his
            Fortune upon the Ruin of a Worthy Gentleman, whom his dissembled Sanctity had seduc'd
            into the treasonable Cause of a <hi rend="italic">Roman Catholick</hi> Out-law. How this
            Design, in the Play, was executed, I refer to the Readers of it; it cannot be mended by
            any critical Remarks I can make in its favour: Let it speak for itself. All the Reason I
            had to think it no bad Performance was, that it was acted eighteen Days running, <ref
              target="n186-2" n="142">[186.2]</ref> and that the Party that were hurt by it (as I
            have been told) have not been the smallest Number of my back Friends ever since. But
            happy was it for this Play that the very Subject was its Protection; a few Smiles of
            silent Contempt were the utmost Disgrace that on the first Day of its Appearance it was
            thought safe to throw upon it; as the <pb n="187" entity="DSSR_000002933_0232"/> Satire
            was chiefly employ'd on the Enemies of the Government, they were not so hardy as to own
            themselves such by any higher Disapprobation or Resentment. But as it was then probable
            I might write again, they knew it would not be long before they might with more Security
            give a Loose to their Spleen, and make up Accounts with me. And to do them Justice, in
            every Play I afterwards produced they paid me the Balance to a Tittle. <ref
              target="n187-1" n="143">[187.1]</ref> But to none was I more beholden than that
            celebrated Author Mr. <hi rend="italic">Mist</hi>, whose <hi rend="italic">Weekly
              Journal</hi>, <ref target="n187-2" n="144">[187.2]</ref> for about fifteen Years
            following, scarce ever fail'd of passing some of his Party Compliments upon me: The
            State and the Stage were his frequent Parallels, and the Minister and <hi rend="italic"
              >Minheer Keiber</hi> the Menager were as constantly droll'd upon: Now, for my own
            Part, though I could never persuade my Wit to have an open Account with him (for as he
            had no Effects of his own, I did not think myself oblig'd to answer his Bills;)
            notwithstanding, <pb n="188" entity="DSSR_000002933_0233"/> I will be so charitable to
            his real <hi rend="italic">Manes</hi>, and to the Ashes of his Paper, as to mention one
            particular Civility he paid to my Memory, after he thought he had ingeniously kill'd me.
            Soon after the <hi rend="italic">Nonjuror</hi> had receiv'd the Favour of the Town, I
            read in one of his Journals the following short Paragraph, <hi rend="italic">viz.
              Yesterday died Mr.</hi> Colley Cibber, <hi rend="italic">late Comedian of the
              Theatre-Royal, notorious for writing the</hi> Nonjuror. The Compliment in the latter
            part I confess I did not dislike, because it came from so impartial a Judge; and it
            really so happen'd that the former part of it was very near being true; for I had that
            very Day just crawled out, after having been some Weeks laid up by a Fever: However, I
            saw no use in being thought to be thoroughly dead before my Time, and therefore had a
            mind to see whether the Town cared to have me alive again: So the Play of the <hi
              rend="italic">Orphan</hi> being to be acted that Day, I quietly stole myself into the
            Part of the <hi rend="italic">Chaplain</hi>, which I had not been seen in for many Years
            before. The Surprize of the Audience at my unexpected Appearance on the very Day I had
            been dead in the News, and the Paleness of my Looks, seem'd to make it a Doubt whether I
            was not the Ghost of my real Self departed: But when I spoke, their Wonder eas'd itself
            by an Applause; which convinc'd me they were then satisfied that my Friend <hi
              rend="italic">Mist</hi> had told a <hi rend="italic">Fib</hi> of me. Now, if simply to
            have shown myself in broad Life, and about my Business, after he had <hi rend="italic"
              >notoriously</hi>
            <pb n="189" entity="DSSR_000002933_0234"/> reported me dead, can be called a Reply, it
            was the only one which his Paper while alive ever drew from me. How far I may be vain,
            then, in supposing that this Play brought me into the Disfavour of so many Wits <ref
              target="n189-1" n="145">[189.1]</ref> and valiant Auditors as afterwards appear'd
            against me, let those who may think it worth their Notice judge. In the mean time, 'till
            I can find a better Excuse for their sometimes particular Treatment of me, I cannot
            easily give up my Suspicion: And if I add a more remarkable Fact, that afterwards
            confirm'd me in it, perhaps it may incline others to join in my Opinion.</p>
          <p>On the first Day of the <hi rend="italic">Provok'd Husband,</hi> ten Years after the
              <hi rend="italic">Nonjuror</hi> had appear'd, <ref target="n189-2" n="146"
            >[189.2]</ref> a powerful Party, not having the Fear of publick Offence or private
            Injury before their Eyes, appear'd most impetuously concern'd for the Demolition of it;
            in which they so far succeeded, that for some Time I gave it up for lost; and to follow

            a dead and damn'd Piece; a swinging Criticism was made upon it in general invective

            World with Particulars; their Sentence, it seems, was Proof enough of its deserving the
            Fate it had met with. But this damn'd Play was, notwithstanding, acted twenty-eight
            Nights together, and left off at a Receipt of upwards of a hundred and forty Pounds;
            which happen'd to be more than in fifty Years before could be then said of any one Play
            whatsoever.</p>
          <p>Now, if such notable Behaviour could break out upon so successful a Play (which too,
            upon the Share Sir <hi rend="italic">John Vanbrugh</hi> had in it, I will venture to
            call a good one) what shall we impute it to? Why may not I plainly say, it was not the
            Play, but Me, who had a Hand in it, they did not like? And for what Reason? if they were
            not asham'd of it, why did not they publish it? No! the Reason had publish'd itself, I
            was the Author of the <hi rend="italic">Nonjuror!</hi> But, perhaps, of all Authors, I
            ought not to make this sort of Complaint, because I have Reason to think that that
            particular Offence has made me more honourable Friends than Enemies; the latter of which
            I am not unwilling should know (however unequal the Merit may be to the Reward) that
            Part of the Bread I now eat was given me for having writ the <hi rend="italic">Nonjuror.</hi>

          <p>And yet I cannot but lament, with many quiet Spectators, the helpless Misfortune that
            has so many Years attended the Stage! That no Law has had Force enough to give it
            absolute Protection! for <pb n="191" entity="DSSR_000002933_0236"/> 'till we can
            civilize its Auditors, the Authors that write for it will seldom have a greater Call to

            the Many in Affluence? or how often does Necessity make many unhappy Gentlemen turn
            Authors in spite of Nature?</p>
          <p>What a Blessing, therefore, is it! what an enjoy'd Deliverance! after a Wretch has been
            driven by Fortune to stand so many wanton Buffets of unmanly Fierceness, to find himself
            at last quietly lifted above the Reach of them!</p>
          <p>But let not this Reflection fall upon my Auditors without Distinction; for though
            Candour and Benevolence are silent Virtues, they are as visible as the most vociferous
            Ill-nature; and I confess the Publick has given me more frequently Reason to be thankful
            than to complain.</p>

            <p> In the Dedication to Steele of "Ximena" (1719) Cibber warmly acknowledges the great
              service Steele had done to the theatre, not only in improving the tone of its
              performances, but also in the mere attracting of public attention to it. "How many a
              time," he says, "have we known the most elegant Audiences drawn together at a Day's
              Warning, by the Influence or Warrant of a single <hi rend="italic">Tatler</hi>, when
              our best Endeavours without it, could not defray the Charge of the Performance." In
              the same Dedication Cibber's gratitude overstepped his judgment, in applying to
              Steele's generous acknowledgment of his indebtedness to Addison's help in his
              "Spectator," &amp;c., Dryden's lines:&mdash;</p>

            <p> Cibber on one occasion manifested temper to a rather unexpected degree. In 1720,
              when Dennis published his attacks on Steele, in connection with his being deprived of
              the Patent, he accused Cibber of impiety and various other crimes and misdemeanours;
              and Cibber is said in the "Answer to the Character of Sir John Edgar" to have inserted
              the following advertisement in the "Daily Post": "Ten Pounds will be paid by Mr.
              CIBBER, of the Theatre Royal, to any person who shall (by a legal proof) discover the

            <p> George Pack is an actor of whom Chetwood ("History," p. 210) gives some account. He
              first came on the stage as a singer, performing the female parts in duets with
              Leveridge. His first appearance chronicled by Genest was at Lincoln's Inn Fields in
              1700, as Westmoreland in the first part of "Henry IV." Chetwood says he was excellent
              as Marplot in "The Busy Body," Beau Maiden in "Tunbridge Walks," Beau Mizen in "The
              Fair Quaker of Deal," &amp;c.: <hi rend="italic">"indeed Nature seem'd to mean him
                for those Sort of Characters."</hi> On 10th March, 1722, he announced his last
              appearance on any stage; but he returned on 21st April and 7th May, 1724, on which
              latter date he had a benefit. Chetwood says that on his retirement he opened the Globe
              Tavern, near Charing-Cross, over against the Hay-market. When Chetwood wrote (1749)
              Pack was no longer alive.</p>

            <p> In the "Weekly Packet," 18th December, 1714, the following appears:&mdash;</p>
            <p>"This Day the New Play-House in Lincolns-Inn Fields, is to be open'd and a Comedy
              acted there, call'd, The Recruiting Officer, by the Company that act under the Patent;
              tho' it is said, that some of the Gentlemen who have left the House in Drury-Lane for
              that Service, are order'd to return to their Colours, upon Pain of not exercising
              their Lungs elsewhere; which may in Time prove of ill Service to the Patentee, that
              has been at vast Expence to make this Theatre as convenient for the Reception of an
              Audience as any one can possibly be."</p>
            <p>Genest remarks that this seems to show that the Lord Chamberlain threatened to
              interfere in the interests of Drury Lane. He adds: "Cibber's silence proves nothing to
              the contrary, as in more than one instance he does not tell the whole truth" (ii.
              565). In defence of Cibber I may say that the Chamberlain's Records contain no hint
              that he threatened to interfere with the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre or its
            actors.</p>

              Steele:&mdash;</p>
            <q>"Well, Sir, when the winter came on, what was done by your Deputies? Why, instead of
              keeping their word with me, they spent above two months of the season in getting up
              "All for Love, or, the World well Lost," a Play which has indeed a noble first act, an
              act which ends with a scene becoming of the dignity of the Tragic Stage. But if HORACE

              the same Passions. Examples of both. The Author quits the Stage. Why.</hi></p>

          <p>HAVING brought the Government of the Stage through such various Changes and
            Revolutions, to this settled State in which it continued to almost the Time of my
            leaving it; <ref target="n192-1" n="148">[192.1]</ref> it cannot be suppos'd that a
            Period of so much Quiet and so long a Train of Success (though happy for those who
            enjoy'd <pb n="193" entity="DSSR_000002933_0238"/> it) can afford such Matter of
            Surprize or Amusement, as might arise from Times of more Distress and Disorder. A quiet
            Time in History, like a Calm in a Voyage, leaves us but in an indolent Station: To talk
            of our Affairs when they were no longer ruffled by Misfortunes, would be a Picture
            without Shade, a flat Performance at best. As I might, therefore, throw all that tedious
            Time of our Tranquillity into one Chasm in my History, and cut my Way short at once to
            my last Exit from the Stage, I shall at least fill it up with such Matter only as I have
            a mind should be known, <ref target="n193-1" n="149">[193.1]</ref> how few soever may
            have <pb n="194" entity="DSSR_000002933_0239"/> Patience to read it: Yet, as I despair
            not of some Readers who may be most awake when they think others have most occasion to
            sleep; who may be more pleas'd to find me languid than lively, or in the <pb n="195"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0240"/> wrong than in the right; why should I scruple (when it
            is so easy a Matter too) to gratify their particular Taste by venturing upon any Error
            that I like, or the Weakness of my Judgment misleads me to commit? <pb n="196"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0241"/> I think, too, I have a very good Chance for my Success
            in this passive Ambition, by shewing myself in a Light I have not been seen in.</p>
          <p>By your Leave then, Gentlemen! let the Scene open, and at once discover your Comedian
            at the Bar! There you will find him a Defendant, and pleasing his own Theatrical Cause
            in a Court of <hi rend="italic">Chancery:</hi> But, as I chuse to have a Chance of
            pleasing others as well as of indulging you, Gentlemen; I must first beg leave to open
            my Case to them; after which my whole Speech upon that Occasion shall be at your Mercy.</p>
          <p>In all the Transactions of Life, there cannot be a more painful Circumstance, than a
            Dispute at Law with a Man with whom we have long liv'd in an agreeable Amity: But when
            Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard Steele,</hi> to get himself out of Difficulties, was
            oblig'd to throw his Affairs into the Hands of Lawyers and Trustees, that Consideration,
            then, could be of no weight: The Friend, or the Gentleman, had no more to do in the
            Matter! Thus, while Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi> no longer acted from himself, it
            may be no Wonder if a Flaw was found in our Conduct for the Law to make Work <pb n="197"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0242"/> with. It must be observed, then, that about two or
            three Years before this Suit was commenc'd, upon Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi>'s
            totally absenting himself from all Care and Menagement of the Stage (which by our
            Articles of Partnership he was equally and jointly oblig'd with us to attend) we were
            reduc'd to let him know that we could not go on at that Rate; but that if he expected to
            make the Business a <hi rend="italic">sine-Cure,</hi> we had as much Reason to expect a
            Consideration for our extraordinary Care of it; and that during his Absence we therefore
            intended to charge our selves at a Sallary of 1<hi rend="italic">l.</hi> 13<hi
              rend="italic">s.</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> every acting Day (unless he could
            shew us Cause to the contrary) for our Menagement: To which, in his compos'd manner, he
            only answer'd; That to be sure we knew what was fitter to be done than he did; that he
            had always taken a Delight in making us easy, and had no Reason to doubt of our doing
            him Justice. Now whether, under this easy Stile of Approbation, he conceal'd any Dislike
            of our Resolution, I cannot say. But, if I may speak my private Opinion, I really
            believe, from his natural Negligence of his Affairs, he was glad, at any rate, to be
            excus'd an Attendance which he was now grown weary of. But, whether I am deceiv'd or
            right in my Opinion, the Fact was truly this, that he never once, directly or
            indirectly, complain'd or objected to our being paid the above-mention'd daily Sum in
            near three Years together; and yet still continued to absent himself from us and our
            Affairs. But notwithstanding he had seen and done all this <pb n="198"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0243"/> with his Eyes open; his Lawyer thought here was still a
            fair Field for a Battle in Chancery, in which, though his Client might be beaten, he was
            sure his Bill must be paid for it: Accordingly, to work with us he went. But, not to be
            so long as the Lawyers were in bringing this Cause to an Issue, I shall at once let you
            know, that it came to a Hearing before the last Sir <hi rend="italic">Joseph
            Jekyll,</hi> then Master of the Rolls, in the Year 1726. <ref target="n198-1" n="150"
              >[198.1]</ref> Now, as the chief Point in dispute was, of what Kind or Importance the
            Business of a Menager was, or in what it principally consisted; it could not be suppos'd
            that the most learned Council could be so well appriz'd of the Nature of it, as one who
            had himself gone through the Care and Fatigue of it. I was therefore encourag'd by our
            Council to speak to that particular Head myself; which I confess I was glad he suffer'd
            me to undertake; but when I tell you that two of the learned Council against us came
            afterwards to be successively Lord-Chancellors, <pb n="199" entity="DSSR_000002933_0244"
            /> it sets my Presumption in a Light that I still tremble to shew it in: But however,
            not to assume more Merit from its Success than was really its Due, I ought fairly to let
            you know, that I was not so hardy as to deliver my Pleading without Notes, in my Hand,
            of the Heads I intended to enlarge upon; for though I thought I could conquer my Fear, I
            could not be so sure of my Memory: But when it came to the critical Moment, the Dread
            and Apprehension of what I had undertaken so disconcerted my Courage, that though I had
            been us'd to talk to above Fifty Thousand different People every Winter, for upwards of
            Thirty Years together; an involuntary and unaffected Proof of my Confusion fell from my
            Eyes; and, as I found myself quite out of my Element, I seem'd rather gasping for Life
            than in a condition to cope with the eminent Orators against me. But, however, I soon
            found, from the favourable Attention of my Hearers, that my Diffidence had done me no
            Disservice: And as the Truth I was to speak to needed no Ornament of Words, I delivered
            it in the plain manner following, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi></p>
          <p>In this Cause, Sir, I humbly conceive there are but two Points that admit of any
            material Dispute. The first is, Whether Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard Steele</hi> is as
            much obliged to do the Duty and Business of a Menager as either <hi rend="italic">Wilks,
              Booth,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cibber:</hi> And the second is, Whether by Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Richard</hi>'s totally withdrawing himself from the Business of a
            Menager, the Defendants are justifiable in charging to each of themselves <pb n="200"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0245"/> the 1<hi rend="italic">l.</hi> 13<hi rend="italic"
            >s.</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">d. per Diem</hi> for their particular Pains and Care in
            carrying on the whole Affairs of the Stage without any Assistance from Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Richard Steele.</hi></p>
          <p>As to the First, if I don't mistake the Words of the Assignment, there is a Clause in
            it that says, All Matters relating to the Government or Menagement of the Theatre shall
            be concluded by a Majority of Voices. Now I presume, Sir, there is no room left to
            alledge that Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi> was ever refused his Voice, though in
            above three Years he never desir'd to give it: And I believe there will be as little
            room to say, that he could have a Voice if he were not a Menager. But, Sir, his being a
            Menager is so self-evident, that it is amazing how he could conceive that he was to take
            the Profits and Advantages of a Menager without doing the Duty of it. And I will be bold
            to say, Sir, that his Assignment of the Patent to <hi rend="italic">Wilks, Booth</hi>,
            and <hi rend="italic">Cibber</hi>, in no one Part of it, by the severest Construction in
            the World, can be wrested to throw the heavy Burthen of the Menagement only upon their
            Shoulders. Nor does it appear, Sir, that either in his Bill, or in his Answer to our
            Cross-Bill, he has offer'd any Hint, or Glimpse of a Reason, for his withdrawing from
            the Menagement at all; or so much as pretend, from the time complained of, that he ever
            took the least Part of his Share of it. Now, Sir, however unaccountable this Conduct of
            Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi> may seem, we will still allow that he had some Cause
            for it; but whether or no that Cause was a reasonable one your Honour will <pb n="201"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0246"/> the better judge, if I may be indulged in the Liberty
            of explaining it.</p>
          <p>Sir, the Case, in plain Truth and Reality, stands thus: Sir <hi rend="italic"
            >Richard</hi>, though no Man alive can write better of Oeconomy than himself, yet,
            perhaps, he is above the Drudgery of practising it: Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi>,
            then, was often in want of Money; and while we were in Friendship with him, we often
            assisted his Occasions: But those Compliances had so unfortunate an Effect, that they
            only heightened his Importunity to borrow more, and the more we lent, the less he minded
            us, or shew'd any Concern for our Welfare. Upon this, Sir, we stopt our Hands at once,
            and peremptorily refus'd to advance another Shilling 'till by the Balance of our
            Accounts it became due to him. And this Treatment (though, we hope, not in the least
            unjustifiable) we have Reason to believe so ruffled his Temper, that he at once was as
            short with us as we had been with him; for, from that Day, he never more came near us:
            Nay, Sir, he not only continued to neglect what he <hi rend="italic">should</hi> have
            done, but actually did what he ought <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to have done: He made an
            Assignment of his Share without our Consent, in a manifest Breach of our Agreement: For,
            Sir, we did not lay that Restriction upon ourselves for no Reason: We knew, before-hand,
            what Trouble and Inconvenience it would be to unravel and expose our Accounts to
            Strangers, who, if they were to do us no hurt by divulging our Secrets, we were sure
            could do us no good by keeping them. If Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi>
            <pb n="202" entity="DSSR_000002933_0247"/> had had our common Interest at heart, he
            would have been as warm in it as we were, and as tender of hurting it: But supposing his
            assigning his Share to others may have done us no great Injury, it is, at least, a
            shrewd Proof that he did not care whether it did us any or no. And if the Clause was not
            strong enough to restrain him from it in Law, there was enough in it to have restrain'd
            him in Honour form breaking it. But take it in its best Light, it shews him as remiss a
            Menager in our Affairs as he naturally was in his own. Suppose, Sir, we had all been as
            careless as himself, which I can't find he has any more Right to be than we have, must
            not our whole Affair have fallen to Ruin? And may we not, by a parity of Reason,
            suppose, that by his Neglect a fourth Part of it <hi rend="italic">does</hi> fall to
            Ruin? But, Sir, there is a particular Reason to believe, that, from our want of Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Richard,</hi> more than a fourth Part <hi rend="italic">does</hi> suffer
            by it: His Rank and Figure in the World, while he gave us the Assistance of them, were
            of extraordinary Service to us: He had an easier Access, and a more regarded Audience at
            Court, than our low Station of Life could pretend to, when our Interest wanted (as it
            often did) a particular Solicitation there. But since we have been deprived of him, the
            very End, the very Consideration of his Share in our Profits is not perform'd on his
            Part. And will Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi>, then, make us no Compensation for so
            valuable a Loss in our Interests, and so palpable an Addition to our Labour? I am
            afraid, Sir, if we were <pb n="203" entity="DSSR_000002933_0248"/> all to be as indolent
            in the Menaging-Part as Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi> presumes he has a Right to
            be; our Patent would soon run us as many Hundreds in Debt, as he had (and still seems
            willing to have) his Share of, for doing of nothing.</p>
          <p>Sir, our next Point in question is whether <hi rend="italic">Wilkes, Booth,</hi> and
              <hi rend="italic">Cibber</hi> are justifiable in charging the 1<hi rend="italic"
            >l.</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">d. per diem</hi> for their
            extraordinary Menagement in the Absence of Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard Steele.</hi> I
            doubt, Sir, it will be hard to come to the Solution of this Point, unless we may be a
            little indulg'd in setting forth what is the daily and necessary Business and Duty of a
            Menager. But, Sir, we will endeavour to be as short as the Circumstances will admit of.</p>
          <p>Sir, by our Books it is apparent that the Menagers have under their Care no less than
            One Hundred and Forty Persons in constant daily Pay: And among such Numbers, it will be
            no wonder if a great many of them are unskilful, idle, and sometimes untractable; all
            which Tempers are to be led, or driven, watch'd, and restrain'd by the continual Skill,
            Care, and Patience of the Menagers. Every Menager is oblig'd, in his turn, to attend two
            or three Hours every Morning at the Rehearsal of Plays and other Entertainments for the
            Stage, or else every Rehearsal would be but a rude Meeting of Mirth and Jollity. The
            same Attendance is as necessary at every Play during the time of its publick Action, in
            which one or more of us have constantly been punctual, whether we have had any part in
            the Play <pb n="204" entity="DSSR_000002933_0249"/> than acted or not. A Menager ought
            to be at the Reading of every new Play when it is first offer'd to the Stage, though
            there are seldom one of those Plays in twenty which, upon hearing, proves to be fit for
            it; and upon such Occasions the Attendance must be allow'd to be as painfully tedious as
            the getting rid of the Authors of such Plays must be disagreeable and difficult. Besides
            this, Sir, a Menager is to order all new Cloaths, to assist in the Fancy and Propriety
            of them, to limit the Expence, and to withstand the unreasonable Importunities of some
            that are apt to think themselves injur'd if they are not finer than their Fellows. A
            Menager is to direct and oversee the Painters, Machinists, Musicians, Singers, and
            Dancers; to have an Eye upon the Door-keepers, Under-Servants, and Officers that,
            without such Care, are too often apt to defraud us, or neglect their Duty.</p>
          <p>And all this, Sir, and more, much more, which we hope will be needless to trouble you
            with, have we done every Day, without the least Assistance from Sir <hi rend="italic"
              >Richard</hi>, even at times when the Concern and Labour of our Parts upon the Stage
            have made it very difficult and irksome to go through with it.</p>
          <p>In this Place, Sir, it may be worth observing that Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi>,
            in his Answer to our Cross-Bill, seems to value himself upon <hi rend="italic"
            >Cibber</hi>'s confessing, in the Dedication of a Play which he made to Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Richard,</hi> that he (Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi>) had done the
            Stage very considerable Service by leading the Town to our Plays, <pb n="205"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0250"/> and filling our Houses by the Force and Influence of
            his <hi rend="italic">Tatlers.</hi>
            <ref target="n205-1" n="151">[205.1]</ref> But Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi>
            forgets that those <hi rend="italic">Tatlers</hi> were written in the late Queen's
            Reign, long before he was admitted to a Share in the Play-house: And in truth, Sir, it
            was our real Sense of those Obligations, and Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi>'s
            assuring us they should be continued, that first and chiefly inclin'd us to invite him
            to share the Profits of our Labours, upon such farther Conditions as in his Assignment
            of the Patent to us are specified. And, Sir, as <hi rend="italic">Cibber</hi>'s publick
            Acknowledgment of those Favours is at the same time an equal Proof of Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Richard</hi>'s <hi rend="italic">Power</hi> to continue them; so, Sir,
            we hope it carries an equal Probability that, without his Promise to <hi rend="italic"
              >use</hi> that Power, he would never have been thought on, much less have been invited
            by us into a Joint-Menagement of the Stage, and into a Share of the Profits: And,
            indeed, what Pretence could he have form'd for asking a Patent from the Crown, had he
            been possess'd of no eminent Qualities but in common with other Men? But, Sir, all these
            Advantages, all these Hopes, nay, Certainties of greater Profits from those great
            Qualities, have we been utterly depriv'd of by the wilful and unexpected Neglect of Sir
              <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi>. But we find, Sir, it is a common thing in the Practice
            of Mankind to justify one Error by committing another: For Sir <hi rend="italic"
            >Richard</hi> has not only refused us the extraordinary Assistance which he is able and
              <pb n="206" entity="DSSR_000002933_0251"/> bound to give us; but, on the contrary, to
            our great Expence and Loss of Time, now calls us to account, in this honourable Court,
            for the Wrong we have done him, in not doing his Business of a Menager for nothing. But,
            Sir, Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi> has not met with such Treatment from us: He has
            not writ Plays for us for <hi rend="italic">Nothing</hi>, we paid him very well, and in
            an extraordinary manner, for his late Comedy of the <hi rend="italic">Conscious
            Lovers:</hi> And though, in writing that Play, he had more Assistance from one of the
            Menagers <ref target="n206-1" n="152">[206.1]</ref> than becomes me to enlarge upon, of
            which Evidence has been given upon Oath by several of our Actors; yet, Sir, he was
            allow'd the full and particular Profits of that Play as an Author, which amounted to
            Three Hundred Pounds, besides about Three Hundred more which he received as a
            Joint-Sharer of the general Profits that arose from it. Now, Sir, though the Menagers
            are not all of them able to write Plays, yet they have all of them been able to do (I
            won't say as good, but at least) as profitable a thing. They have invented and adorn'd a
            Spectacle that for Forty Days together has brought more Money to the House than the best
            Play that ever was writ. The Spectacle I mean, Sir, is that of the Coronation-Ceremony
            of <hi rend="italic">Anna Bullen:</hi>
            <ref target="n206-2" n="153">[206.2]</ref> And though we allow a <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0252"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0253"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0254"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0255"/>
            <pb n="207" entity="DSSR_000002933_0256"/> good Play to be the more laudable
            Performance, yet, Sir, in the profitable Part of it there is no Comparison. If,
            therefore, our Spectacle brought in as much, or more Money than Sir <hi rend="italic"
              >Richard</hi>'s Comedy, what is there on his Side but Usage that intitles him to be
            paid for one, more than we are for t'other? But then, Sir, if he is so profitably
            distinguish'd for his Play, if we yield him up to the Preference, and pay him for his
            extraordinary Composition, and take nothing for our own, though it turn'd out more to
            our common Profit; sure, Sir, while we do such extraordinary Duty as Menagers, and while
            he neglects his Share of that Duty, he cannot grudge us the moderate Demand we make for
            our separate Labour?</p>
          <p>To conclude, Sir, if by our constant Attendance, our Care, our Anxiety (not to mention
            the disagreeable Contests we sometimes meet with, both within and without Doors, in the
            Menagement of our Theatre) we have not only saved the whole from Ruin, which, if we had
            all follow'd Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi>'s Example, could not have been avoided;
            I say, Sir, if we have still made it so valuable an Income to him, without his giving us
            the least Assistance for several Years past; we hope, Sir, that the poor Labourers that
            have done all this for Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi> will not be thought unworthy
            of their Hire.</p>
          <p>How far our Affairs, being set in this particular Light, might assist our Cause, may be
            of no great Importance to guess; but the Issue of it was this: That Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Richard</hi> not having made any objection <pb n="208"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0257"/> to what we had charged for Menagement for three Years
            together; and as our Proceedings had been all transacted in open Day, without any
            clandestine Intention of Fraud; we were allow'd the Sums in dispute above-mention'd; and
            Sir <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi> not being advised to appeal to the Lord-Chancellor,
            both Parties paid their own Costs, and thought it their mutual Interest to let this be
            the last of their Lawsuits.</p>
          <p>And now, gentle Reader, I ask Pardon for so long an Imposition on your Patience: For
            tho' I may have no ill Opinion of this Matter myself; yet to you I can very easily
            conceive it may have been tedious. You are, therefore, at your own Liberty of charging
            the whole Impertinence of it, either to the Weakness of my Judgment, or the Strength of
            my Vanity; and I will so far join in your Censure, that I farther confess I have been so
            impatient to give it you, that you have had it out of its Turn: For, some Years before
            this Suit was commenced, there were other Facts that ought to have had a Precedence in
            my History: But that, I dare say, is an Oversight you will easily excuse, provided you
            afterwards find them worth reading. However, as to that Point I must take my Chance, and
            shall therefore proceed to speak of the Theatre which was order'd by his late Majesty to
            be erected in the Great old Hall at <hi rend="italic">Hampton-Court</hi>; where Plays
            were intended to have been acted twice a Week during the Summer-Season. But before the
            Theatre could be finish'd, above half the Month of <hi rend="italic">September</hi>
            <pb n="209" entity="DSSR_000002933_0258"/> being elapsed, there were but seven Plays
            acted before the Court returned to <hi rend="italic">London</hi>. <ref target="n209-1"
              n="154">[209.1]</ref> This throwing open a Theatre in a Royal Palace seem'd to be
            reviving the Old <hi rend="italic">English</hi> hospitable Grandeur, where the lowest
            Rank of neighbouring Subjects might make themselves merry at Court without being laugh'd
            at themselves. In former Reigns, Theatrical Entertainments at the Royal Palaces had been
            perform'd at vast Expence, as appears by the Description of the Decorations in several
            of <hi rend="italic">Ben. Johnson</hi>'s Masques in King <hi rend="italic">James</hi>
            and <hi rend="italic">Charles the First</hi>'s Time; <ref target="n209-2" n="155"
              >[209.2]</ref> many curious and original Draughts of which, by Sir <hi rend="italic"
              >Inigo Jones,</hi> I have seen in the <hi rend="italic">Mus&aelig;um</hi> of our
            greatest Master and Patron of Arts and Architecture, whom it would be a needless Liberty
            to name. <ref target="n209-3" n="156">[209.3]</ref> But when our Civil Wars ended in the
            Decadence of Monarchy, it was then an Honour to the Stage to have fallen with it: Yet,
            after the Restoration of <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi> II. some faint Attempts were
            made to revive these Theatrical Spectacles at Court; but I have met with no Account of
            above one Masque acted there by the Nobility; which was that of <hi rend="italic"
              >Calisto,</hi> written by <hi rend="italic">Crown,</hi> the Author of Sir <hi
              rend="italic">Courtly Nice.</hi> For what Reason <hi rend="italic">Crown</hi> was
            chosen to that Honour <pb n="210" entity="DSSR_000002933_0259"/> rather than <hi
              rend="italic">Dryden,</hi> who was then Poet-Laureat and out of all Comparison his
            Superior in Poetry, may seem surprizing: But if we consider the Offence which the then
            Duke of <hi rend="italic">Buckingham</hi> took at the Character of <hi rend="italic"
              >Zimri</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Dryden</hi>'s <hi rend="italic">Absalom,</hi>
            &amp;c. (which might probably be a Return to his Grace's <hi rend="italic"
              >Drawcansir</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Rehearsal</hi>) we may suppose the Prejudice
            and Recommendation of so illustrious a Pretender to Poetry might prevail at Court to
            give <hi rend="italic">Crown</hi> this Preference. <ref target="n210-1" n="157"
            >[210.1]</ref> In the same Reign the King had his Comedians at <hi rend="italic"
            >Windsor</hi>, but upon a particular Establishment; for tho' they acted in St. <hi
              rend="italic">George</hi>'s Hall, within the Royal Palace, yet (as I have been
            inform'd by an Eye-witness) they were permitted to take Money at the Door of every
            Spectator; whether this was an Indulgence, in Conscience I cannot say; but it was a
            common Report among the principal Actors, when I first came into the <hi rend="italic"
              >Theatre-Royal,</hi> in 1690, that there was then due to the Company from that Court
            about One Thousand Five Hundred Pounds for Plays commanded, <hi rend="italic"
              >&amp;c.</hi> and yet it was the general Complaint, in that Prince's Reign, that
            he paid too much Ready-money for his Pleasures: <pb n="211" entity="DSSR_000002933_0260"
            /> But these Assertions I only give as I received them, without being answerable for
            their Reality. This Theatrical Anecdote, however, puts me in mind of one of a more
            private nature, which I had from old solemn <hi rend="italic">Boman</hi>, the late Actor
            of venerable Memory. <ref target="n211-1" n="158">[211.1]</ref>
            <hi rend="italic">Boman,</hi> then a Youth, and fam'd for his Voice, was appointed to
            sing some Part in a Concert of Musick at the private Lodgings of Mrs. <hi rend="italic"
              >Gwin</hi>; at which were only present the King, the Duke of <hi rend="italic"
            >York</hi>, and one or two more who were usually admitted upon those detach'd Parties of
            Pleasure. When the Performance was ended, the King express'd himself highly pleased, and
            gave it extraordinary Commendations: Then, Sir, said the Lady, to shew you don't speak
            like a Courtier, I hope you will make the Performers a handsome Present: The King said
            he had no Money about him, and ask'd the Duke if he had any? To which the Duke reply'd,
            I believe, Sir, not above a Guinea or two. Upon which the laughing Lady, turning to the
            People about her, and making bold with the King's common Expression, cry'd, <hi
              rend="italic">Od's Fish! what Company am I got into!</hi></p>
          <pb n="212" entity="DSSR_000002933_0261"/>
          <p>Whether the reverend Historian of his <hi rend="italic">Own Time,</hi>
            <ref target="n212-1" n="159">[212.1]</ref> among the many other Reasons of the same Kind
            he might have for stiling this Fair One the <hi rend="italic">indiscreetest and wildest
              Creature that ever was in a Court,</hi> might know this to be one of them, I can't
            say: But if we consider her in all the Disadvantages of her Rank and Education, she does
            not appear to have had any criminal Errors more remarkable than her Sex's Frailty to
            answer for: And if the same Author, in his latter End of that Prince's Life, seems to
            reproach his Memory with too kind a Concern for her Support, we may allow that it
            becomes a Bishop to have had no Eyes or Taste for the frivolous Charms or playful <hi
              rend="italic">Badinage</hi> of a King's Mistress: Yet, if the common Fame of her may
            be believ'd, which in my Memory was not doubted, she had less to be laid to her Charge
            than any other of those Ladies who were in the same State of Preferment: She never
            meddled in Matters of serious Moment, or was the Tool of working Politicians: Never
            broke into those amorous Infidelities which others in that grave Author are accus'd of;
            but was as visibly distinguish'd by her particular Personal Inclination to the King, as
            her Rivals were by their Titles and Grandeur. Give me leave to carry (perhaps the
            Partiality of) my Observation a little farther. The same Author, in the same Page, 263,
              <ref target="n212-2" n="160">[212.2]</ref> tells us, That "Another of the King's
            Mistresses, the Daughter of a Clergyman, Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Roberts</hi>, in whom
            her first <pb n="213" entity="DSSR_000002933_0262"/> "Education had so deep a Root, that
            though she fell "into many scandalous Disorders, with very dismal "Adventures in them
            all, yet a Principle of Religion "was so deep laid in her, that tho' it did not
            "restrain her, yet it kept alive in her such a constant "Horror of Sin, that she was
            never easy in an ill "course, and died with a great Sense of her former "ill Life."</p>
          <p>To all this let us give an implicit Credit: Here is the Account of a frail Sinner made
            up with a Reverend Witness! Yet I cannot but lament that this Mitred Historian, who
            seems to know more Personal Secrets than any that ever writ before him, should not have
            been as inquisitive after the last Hours of our other Fair Offender, whose Repentance I
            have been unquestionably inform'd, appear'd in all the contrite Symptoms of a Christian
            Sincerity. If therefore you find I am so much concern'd to make this favourable mention
            of the one, because she was a Sister of the <hi rend="italic">Theatre,</hi> why may
            not&mdash; But I dare not be so presumptuous, so uncharitably bold, as to suppose
            the other was spoken better of merely because she was the Daughter of a <hi
              rend="italic">Clergyman.</hi> Well, and what then? What's all this idle Prate, you may
            say, to the matter in hand? Why, I say your Question is a little too critical; and if
            you won't give an Author leave, now and then, to embellish his Work by a natural
            Reflexion, you are an ungentle Reader. But I have done with my Digression, and return to
            our Theatre at <hi rend="italic">Hampton-Court,</hi> where I am <pb n="214"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0263"/> not sure the Reader, be he ever so wise, will meet with
            any thing more worth his notice: However, if he happens to read, as I write, for want of
            something better to do, he will go on; and perhaps wonder when I tell him that</p>
          <p>A Play presented at Court, or acted on a publick Stage, seem to their different
            Auditors a different Entertainment. Now hear my Reason for it. In the common Theatre the
            Guests are at home, where the politer Forms of Good-breeding are not so nicely regarded:
            Every one there falls to, and likes or finds fault according to his natural Taste or
            Appetite. At Court, where the Prince gives the Treat, and honours the Table with his own
            Presence, the Audience is under the Restraint of a Circle, where Laughter or Applause
            rais'd higher than a Whisper would be star'd at. At a publick Play they are both let
            loose, even 'till the Actor is sometimes pleas'd with his not being able to be heard for
            the Clamour of them. But this Coldness or Decency of Attention at Court I observ'd had
            but a melancholy Effect upon the impatient Vanity of some of our Actors, who seem'd
            inconsolable when their flashy Endeavours to please had pass'd unheeded: Their not
            considering where they were quite disconcerted them; nor could they recover their
            Spirits 'till from the lowest Rank of the Audience some gaping <hi rend="italic"
            >John</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Joan,</hi> in the fullness of their Hearts, roar'd out
            their Approbation: And, indeed, such a natural Instance of honest Simplicity a Prince
            himself, whose Indulgence <pb n="215" entity="DSSR_000002933_0264"/> knows where to make
            Allowances, might reasonably smile at, and perhaps not think it the worst part of his
            Entertainment. Yet it must be own'd, that an Audience may be as well too much reserv'd,
            as too profuse of their Applause: For though it is possible a <hi rend="italic"
              >Betterton</hi> would not have been discourag'd form throwing out an Excellence, or
            elated into an Error, by his Auditors being too little or too much pleas'd, yet, as
            Actors of his Judgment are Rarities, those of less Judgment may sink into a Flatness in
            their Performance for want of that Applause, which from the generality of Judges they
            might perhaps have some Pretence to: And the Auditor, when not seeming to feel what
            ought to affect him, may rob himself of something more than he might have had by giving
            the Actor his Due, who measures out his Power to please according to the Value he sets
            upon his Hearer's Taste or Capacity. But, however, as we were not here itinerant
            Adventurers, and had properly but one Royal Auditor to please; after that Honour was
            attain'd to, the rest of our Ambition had little to look after: And that the King was
            often pleas'd, we were not only assur'd by those who had the Honour to be near him; but
            could see it, from the frequent Satisfaction in his Looks at particular Scenes and
            Passages: One Instance of which I am tempted to relate, because it was at a Speech that
            might more naturally affect a Sovereign Prince than any private Spectator. In <hi

            Letters of Indemnity into every County where the Payment of certain heavy taxes had been
            disputed: Upon which the Cardinal whispers the following Directions to his Secretary <hi

          <p>The Solicitude of this Spiritual Minister, in filching from his Master the Grace and
            Merit of a good Action, and dressing up himself in it, while himself had been Author of
            the Evil complain'd of, was so easy a Stroke of his Temporal Conscience, that it seem'd
            to raise the King into something more than a Smile whenever that Play came before him:
            And I had a more distinct Occasion to observe this Effect; because my proper Stand on
            the Stage when I spoke the Lines required me to be near the Box where the King usually
            sate: <ref target="n216-1" n="161">[216.1]</ref> In a Word, this Play is so true <pb
              n="217" entity="DSSR_000002933_0266"/> a Dramatick Chronicle of an old <hi
              rend="italic">English</hi> Court, and where the Character of <hi rend="italic">Harry
              the Eighth</hi> is so exactly drawn, even to a humourous Likeness, that it may be no
            wonder why his Majesty's particular Taste for it should have commanded it three several
            times in one Winter.</p>
          <p>This, too, calls to my Memory an extravagant Pleasantry of Sir <hi rend="italic"
              >Richard Steele,</hi> who being ask'd by a grave Nobleman, after the same Play had
            been presented at <hi rend="italic">Hampton-Court,</hi> how the King lik'd it, reply'd,
              <hi rend="italic">So terribly well, my Lord, that I was afraid I should have lost all
              my Actors! For I was not sure the King would not keep them to fill the Posts at Court
              that he saw them so fit for in the Play.</hi></p>
          <p>It may be imagin'd that giving Plays to the People at such a distance from <hi
              rend="italic">London</hi> could not but be attended with an extraordinary Expence; and
            it was some Difficulty, when they were first talk'd of, to bring them under a moderate
            Sum; I shall therefore, in as few Words as possible, give a Particular of what
            Establishment they were then brought to, that in case the same Entertainments should at
            any time hereafter be call'd to the same Place, future Courts may judge how far the
            Precedent may stand good, or need an Alteration.</p>
          <pb n="218" entity="DSSR_000002933_0267"/>
          <p>Though the stated Fee for a Play acted at <hi rend="italic">Whitehall</hi> had been
            formerly but Twenty Pounds; <ref target="n218-1" n="162">[218.1]</ref> yet, as that
            hinder'd not the Company's acting on the same Day at the Publick Theatre, that Sum was
            almost all clear Profits to them: But this Circumstance not being practicable when they
            were commanded to <hi rend="italic">Hampton-Court,</hi> a new and extraordinary Charge
            was unavoidable: The Menagers, therefore, not to inflame it, desired no Consideration
            for their own Labour, farther than the Honour of being employ'd in his Majesty's
            Commands; and, if the other Actors might be allow'd each their Day's Pay and travelling
            Charges, they should hold themselves ready to act any Play there at a Day's Warning: And
            that the Trouble might be less by being divided, the Lord-Chamberlain was pleas'd to let
            us know that the Houshold-Musick, the Wax Lights, and a <hi rend="italic"
            >Chaise-Marine</hi> to carry our moving Wardrobe to every different Play, should be
            under the Charge of the proper Officers. Notwithstanding these assistances, the Expence
            of every Pay amounted to Fifty Pounds: Which Account, when all was over, was not only
            allow'd us, but his Majesty was graciously pleas'd to give the Menagers Two Hundred
            Pounds more for their particular Performance and Trouble in only <pb n="219"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0268"/> seven times acting. <ref target="n219-1" n="163"
              >[219.1]</ref> Which last Sum, though it might not be too much for a Sovereign Prince
            to give, it was certainly more than our utmost Merit ought to have hop'd for: And I
            confess, when I receiv'd the Order for the Money from his Grace the Duke of <hi
              rend="italic">Newcastle,</hi> then Lord-Chamberlain, I was so surpris'd, that I
            imagin'd his Grace's Favour, or Recommendation of our Readiness or Diligence, must have
            contributed to so high a Consideration of it, and was offering my Acknowledgments as I
            thought them due; but was soon stopt short by his Grace's Declaration, That we had no
            Obligations for it but to the King himself, who had given it from no other Motive than
            his own Bounty. Now whether we may suppose that Cardinal <hi rend="italic">Wolsey</hi>
            (as you see <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> has drawn him) would silently have taken
            such low Acknowledgments to himself, perhaps may be as little worth consideration as my
            mentioning this Circumstance has been necessary: But if it is due to the Honour and
            Integrity of the (then) Lord-Chamberlain, I cannot think it wholly impertinent.</p>
          <p>Since that time there has been but one Play given at <hi rend="italic"
            >Hampton-Court</hi>, which was for the Entertainment of the Duke of <hi rend="italic"
              >Lorrain</hi>; and for which is present <pb n="220" entity="DSSR_000002933_0269"/>
            Majesty was pleased to order us a Hundred Pounds.</p>
          <p>The Reader may now plainly see that I am ransacking my Memory for such remaining Scraps
            of Theatrical History as may not perhaps be worth his Notice: But if they are such as
            tempt me to write them, why may I not hope that in this wide World there may be many an
            idle Soul, no wiser than my self, who may be equally tempted to read them?</p>
          <p>I have so often had occasion to compare the State of the Stage to the State of a
            Nation, that I yet feel a Reluctancy to drop the Comparison, or speak of the one without
            some Application to the other. How many Reigns, then, do I remember, from that of <hi
              rend="italic">Charles</hi> the Second, through all which there has been, from one half
            of the People or the other, a Succession of Clamour against every different Ministry for
            the time being? And yet, let the Cause of this Clamour have been never so well grounded,
            it is impossible but that some of those Ministers must have been wiser and honester Men
            than others: If this be true, as true I believe it is, why may I not then say, as some
            Fool in a <hi rend="italic">French</hi> Play does upon a like Occasion&mdash;<hi
              rend="italic">Justement, comme chez nous!</hi> 'Twas exactly the same with our
            Menagement! let us have done never so well, we could not please every body: All I can
            say in our Defence is, that though many good Judges might possibly conceive how the
            State of the Stage might have been mended, yet the best of them never pretended to
            remember the Time when <pb n="221" entity="DSSR_000002933_0270"/> it was better! or
            could shew us the way to make their imaginary Amendments practicable.</p>
          <p>For though I have often allow'd that our best Merit as Actors was never equal to that
            of our Predecessors, yet I will venture to say, that in all its Branches the Stage had
            never been under so just, so prosperous, and so settled a Regulation, for forty Years
            before, as it was at the Time I am speaking of. The most plausible Objection to our
            Administration seemed to be, that we took no Care to breed up young Actors to succeed
            us; <ref target="n221-1" n="164">[221.1]</ref> and this was imputed as the greater
            Fault, because it was taken for granted that it was a Matter as easy as planting so many
            Cabbages: Now, might not a Court as well be reproached for not breeding up a Succession
            of complete Ministers? And yet it is evident, that if Providence or Nature don't supply
            us with both, the State and the Stage will be but poorly supported. If a Man of an ample
            Fortune should take it into his Head to give a younger Son an extraordinary Allowance in
            order to breed him a great Poet, what might we suppose would be the Odds that his
            Trouble and Money would be all thrown away? Not more than it would be against the Master
            of a Theatre who should say, this or that young Man I will take care shall be an
            excellent Actor! Let it be our <pb n="222" entity="DSSR_000002933_0271"/> Excuse, then,
            for that mistaken Charge against us; that since there was no Garden or Market where
            accomplished Actors grew or were to be sold, we could only pick them up, as we do
            Pebbles of Value, by Chance: We may polish a thousand before we can find one fit to make
            a Figure in the Lid of a Snuff-Box. And how few soever we were able to produce, it is no
            Proof that we were not always in search of them: Yet, at worst, it was allow'd that our
            Deficiency of Men Actors was not so visible as our Scarcity of tolerable Women: But when
            it is consider'd, that the Life of Youth and Beauty is too short for the bringing an
            Actress to her Perfection; were I to mention, too, the many frail fair Ones I remember
            who, before they could arrive to their Theatrical Maturity, were feloniously stolen from
            the Tree, it would rather be thought our Misfortune than our Fault that we were not
            better provided. <ref target="n222-1" n="165">[222.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>Even the Laws of a Nunnery, we find, are thought no sufficient Security against
            Temptations without Iron Grates and high Walls to inforce them; which the Architecture
            of a Theatre will not so properly admit of: And yet, methinks, Beauty that has not those
            artificial Fortresses about it, that has no Defence but its natural Virtue (which upon
            the Stage <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0272"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0273"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0274"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0275"/>
            <pb n="223" entity="DSSR_000002933_0276"/> has more than once been met with) makes a
            much more meritorious Figure in Life than that immur'd Virtue which could never be
            try'd. But alas! as the poor Stage is but the Show-glass to a Toy-shop, we must not
            wonder if now and then some of the Bawbles should find a Purchaser.</p>
          <p>However, as to say more or less than Truth are equally unfaithful in an Historian, I
            cannot but own that, in the Government of the Theatre, I have known many Instances where
            the Merit of promising Actors has not always been brought forward, with the Regard or
            Favour it had a Claim to: And if I put my Reader in mind, that in the early Part of this
            Work I have shewn thro' what continued Difficulties and Discouragements I myself made my
            way up the Hill of Preferment, he may justly call it too strong a Glare of my Vanity: I
            am afraid he is in the right; but I pretend not to be one of those chaste Authors that
            know how to write without it: When Truth is to be told, it may be as much Chance as
            Choice if it happens to turn out in my Favour: But to shew that this was true of others
            as well as myself, <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> shall be another Instance. In 1707, when
              <hi rend="italic">Swiney</hi> was the only Master of the Company in the <hi
              rend="italic">Hay-Market</hi>; <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>, tho' he was then but an
            hired Actor himself, rather chose to govern and give Orders than to receive them; and
            was so jealous of <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi>'s rising, that with a high Hand he gave
            the Part of <hi rend="italic">Pierre,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Venice Preserv'd,</hi>
            to <hi rend="italic">Mills</hi> the elder, who (not to undervalue him) was out of Sight
            in the Pretensions <pb n="224" entity="DSSR_000002933_0277"/> that <hi rend="italic"
              >Booth,</hi> then young as he was, had to the same Part: <ref target="n224-1" n="166"
              >[224.1]</ref> and this very Discouragement so strongly affected him, that not long
            after, when several of us became Sharers with <hi rend="italic">Swiney, Booth</hi>
            rather chose to risque his Fortune with the old Patentee in <hi rend="italic"
              >Drury-Lane,</hi> than come into our Interest, where he saw he was like to meet with
            more of those Partialities. <ref target="n224-2" n="167">[224.2]</ref> And yet, again,
              <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> himself, when he came to be a Menager, would sometimes
            suffer his Judgment to be blinded by his Inclination to Actors whom the Town seem'd to
            have but an indifferent Opinion of. This again inclines me to ask another of my odd
            Questions, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Have we never seen the same passions govern a
            Court! How many white Staffs and great Places do we find, in our Histories, have been
            laid at the Feet of a Monarch, because they chose not to give way to a Rival in Power,
            or hold a second Place in his Favour? How many <hi rend="italic">Whigs</hi> and <hi
              rend="italic">Tories</hi> have chang'd their Parties, when their good or bad
            Pretensions have met with a Check to their higher Preferment?</p>
          <p>Thus we see, let the Degrees and Rank of Men be ever so unequal, Nature throws out
            their Passions from the same Motives; 'tis not the Eminence or Lowliness of either that
            makes the one, when provok'd, more or less a reasonable Creature than the <pb n="225"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0278"/> other: The Courtier and the Comedian, when their
            Ambition is out of Humour, take just the same Measures to right themselves.</p>
          <p>If this familiar Stile of talking should, in the Nostrils of Gravity and Wisdom, smell
            a little too much of the Presumptuous or the Pragmatical, I will at least descend lower
            in my Apology for it, by calling to my Assistance the old, humble Proverb, <hi
              rend="italic">viz. 'Tis an ill Bird that, &amp;c.</hi> Why then should I debase my
            Profession by setting it in vulgar Lights, when I may shew it to more favourable
            Advantages? And when I speak of our Errors, why may I not extenuate them by illustrious
            Examples? or by not allowing them greater than the greatest Men have been subject to? Or
            why, indeed, may I not suppose that a sensible Reader will rather laugh than look grave
            at the Pomp of my Parallels?</p>
          <p>Now, as I am tied down to the Veracity of an Historian whose Facts cannot be supposed,
            like those in a Romance, to be in the Choice of the Author to make them more marvellous
            by Invention; if I should happen to sink into a little farther Insignificancy, let the
            simple Truth of what I have farther to say, be my Excuse for it. I am obliged,
            therefore, to make the Experiment, by shewing you the Conduct of our Theatrical Ministry
            in such Lights as on various Occasions it appear'd in.</p>
          <p>Though <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> had more Industry and Application than any Actor I
            had ever known, yet we found it possible that those necessary Qualities might sometimes
              <pb n="226" entity="DSSR_000002933_0279"/> be so misconducted as not only to make them
            useless, but hurtful to our Common-wealth; <ref target="n226-1" n="168">[226.1]</ref>
            for while he was impatient to be foremost in every thing, he frequently shock'd the
            honest Ambition of others, whose Measures might have been more serviceable, could his
            Jealousy have given way to them. His own Regards for himself, therefore, were, to avoid
            a disagreeable Dispute with him, too often complied with: But this leaving his Diligence
            to his own Conduct, made us, in some Instances, pay dearly for it: For Example; he would
            take as much, or more Pains, in forwarding to the Stage the Water-gruel Work of some
            insipid Author that happen'd rightly to make his Court to him, <ref target="n226-2"
              n="169">[226.2]</ref> than he would for the <pb n="227" entity="DSSR_000002933_0280"/>
            best Play wherein it was not his Fortune to be chosen for the best Character. So great
            was his Impatience to be employ'd, that I scarce remember, in twenty Years, above one
            profitable Play we could get to be reviv'd, wherein he found he was to make no
            considerable Figure, independent of him: But the <hi rend="italic">Tempest</hi> having
            done Wonders formerly, he could not form any Pretensions to let it lie longer dormant:
            However, his Coldness to it was so visible, that he took all Occasions to postpone and
            discourage its Progress, by frequently taking up the morning-Stage with something more
            to his Mind. Having been myself particularly solicitous for the reviving this Play, <hi
              rend="italic">Dogget</hi> (for this was before <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> came into
            the Menagement) consented that the extraordinary Decorations and Habits should be left
            to my Care and Direction, as the fittest Person whose Temper could jossle through the
            petulant Opposition that he knew <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> would be always offering
            to it, because he had but a middling Part in it, that of <hi rend="italic"
            >Ferdinand:</hi> Notwithstanding which, so it happened, that the Success of it shew'd
            (not to take from the Merit of <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>) that it was possible to
            have good Audiences without his extraordinary Assistance. In the first six Days of
            acting it we paid all our constant and incidental Expence, and shar'd each of us a
            hundred Pounds: The greatest Profit that in so little a Time had yet been known within
            my Memory! But, alas! what was paltry Pelf to Glory? That was the darling Passion of <hi
              rend="italic">Wilks</hi>'s Heart! and <pb n="228" entity="DSSR_000002933_0281"/> not
            to advance in it was, to so jealous an Ambition, a painful Retreat, a mere Shade to his
            Laurels! and the common Benefit was but a poor Equivalent to his want of particular
            Applause! To conclude, not Prince <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
              >Baden</hi>, though a Confederate General with the Duke of <hi rend="italic"
              >Marlborough,</hi> was more inconsolable upon the memorable Victory at <hi
              rend="italic">Blenheim,</hi> at which he was not present, than our Theatrical Hero was
            to see any Action prosperous that he was not himself at the Head of. If this, then was
            an Infirmity in <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>, why may not my shewing the same Weakness
            in so great a Man mollify the Imputation, and keep his Memory in Countenance.</p>
          <p>This laudable Appetite for Fame in <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> was not, however, to be
            fed without that constant Labour which only himself was able to come up to: He therefore
            bethought him of the means to lessen the Fatigue, and at the same time to heighten his
            Reputation; which was, by giving up now and then a Part to some raw Actor who he was
            sure would disgrace it, and consequently put the Audience in mind of his superior
            Performance: Among this sort of Indulgences to young Actors he happen'd once to make a
            Mistake that set his Views in a clear Light. The best Criticks, I believe, will allow
            that in <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi>'s <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> there are, in
            the Part of <hi rend="italic">Macduff</hi>, two Scenes, the one of Terror, in the second
            Act, and the other of Compassion, in the fourth, equal to any that dramatick Poetry has
            produc'd: These Scenes <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> had acted with Success, tho' far
            short of that happier <pb n="229" entity="DSSR_000002933_0282"/> Skill and Grace which
              <hi rend="italic">Monfort</hi> had formerly shewn in them. <ref target="n229-1"
              n="170">[229.1]</ref> Such a Part, however, one might imagine would be one of the last
            a good Actor would chuse to part with: But <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> was of a
            different Opinion; for <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> was thrice as long, had more great
            Scenes of Action, and bore the Name of the Play: Now, to be a second in any Play was
            what he did not much care for, and had been seldom us'd to: This Part of <hi
              rend="italic">Macduff,</hi> therefore,he had given to one <hi rend="italic"
            >Williams,</hi> as yet no extraordinary, though a promising Actor. <ref target="n229-2"
              n="171">[229.2]</ref>
            <hi rend="italic">Williams,</hi> in the Simplicity of his Heart, immediately <pb n="230"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0283"/> told <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> what a Favour <hi
              rend="italic">Wilks</hi> had done him. <hi rend="italic">Booth,</hi> as he had Reason,
            thought <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> had here carried his Indulgence and his Authority a
            little too far; for as <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> had no better a Part in the same
            Play than that of <hi rend="italic">Banquo</hi>, he found himself too much disregarded
            in letting so young an Actor take Place of him: <hi rend="italic">Booth,</hi> therefore,
            who knew the Value of <hi rend="italic">Macduff,</hi> proposed to do it himself, and to
            give <hi rend="italic">Banquo</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Williams</hi>; and to make him
            farther amends, offer'd him any other of his Parts that he thought might be of Service
            to him. <hi rend="italic">Williams</hi> was content with the Exchange, and thankful for
            the Promise. This Scheme, indeed, (had it taken Effect) might have been an Ease to <hi
              rend="italic">Wilks,</hi> and possibly no Disadvantage to the Play; but
            softly&mdash;That was not quite what we had a Mind to! No sooner, then, came this
            Proposal to <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>, but off went the Masque and out came the
            Secret! For though <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> wanted to be eas'd of the Part, he did
            not desire to be <hi rend="italic">excell's</hi> in it; and as he was not sure but that
            might be the case if <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> were to act it, <ref target="n230-1"
              n="172">[230.1]</ref> he wisely retracted his <pb n="231" entity="DSSR_000002933_0284"
            /> own Project, took <hi rend="italic">Macduff</hi> again to himself, and while he liv'd
            never had a Thought of running the same Hazard by any farther Offer to resign it.</p>
          <p>Here I confess I am at a Loss for a Fact in History to which this can be a Parallel! To
            be weary of a Post, even to a real Desire of resigning it; and yet to chuse rather to
            drudge on in it than suffer it to be well supplied (though to share in that Advantage)
            is a Delicacy of Ambition that <hi rend="italic">Machiavil</hi> himself has made no
            mention of: Or if in old <hi rend="italic">Rome,</hi> the Jealousy of any pretended
            Patriot equally inclin'd to abdicate his Office may have come up to it, 'tis more than
            my reading remembers.</p>
          <p>As nothing can be more impertinent than shewing too frequent a Fear to be thought so, I
            will, without farther Apology, rather risque that Imputation than not tell you another
            Story much to the same purpose, and of no more consequence than my last. To make you
            understand it, however, a little Preface will be necessary.</p>
          <p>If the Merit of an Actor (as it certainly does) consists more in the Quality than the
            Quantity of his Labour; the other Menagers had no visible Reason to think this needless
            Ambition of <hi rend="italic">Wilks,</hi> in being so often and sometimes so
            unnecessarily employ'd, gave him any Title to a Superiority; especially when our
            Articles of Agreement had allow'd us all to be equal. But what are narrow Contracts to
            great Souls with growing Desires? <hi rend="italic">Wilks,</hi> therefore, who thought
            himself lessen'd in appealing to any Judgment but <pb n="232"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0285"/> his own, plainly discovered by his restless Behaviour
            (though he did not care to speak out) that he thought he had a Right to some higher
            Consideration for his Performance: This was often <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi>'s
            Opinion, as well as my own. It must be farther observ'd, that he actually had a separate
            Allowance of Fifty Pounds a Year for writing our daily Play-Bills for the Printer: Which
            Province, to say the Truth, was the only one we car'd to trust to his particular
            Intendance, or could find out for a Pretence to distinguish him. But, to speak a plainer
            Truth, this Pension, which was not part of our original Agreement, was merely paid to
            keep him quiet, and not that we thought it due to so insignificant a Charge as what a
            Prompter had formerly executed. This being really the Case, his frequent Complaints of
            being a Drudge to the Company grew something more than disagreeable to us: For we could
            not digest the Imposition of a Man's setting himself to work, and then bringing in his
            own Bill for it. <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi>, therefore, who was less easy than I was
            to see him so often setting a Merit upon this Quantity of his Labour, which neither
            could be our Interest or his own to lay upon him, proposed to me that we might remove
            this pretended Grievance by reviving some Play that might be likely to live, and be
            easily acted, without <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>'s having any Part in it. About this
            time an unexpected Occasion offer'd itself to put our Project in practice: What follow'd
            our Attempt will be all (if any thing be) worth Observation in my Story.</p>

          <pb n="233" entity="DSSR_000002933_0286"/>
          <p>In 1725 we were call'd upon, in a manner that could not be resisted, to revive the <hi
              rend="italic">Provok'd Wife,</hi>
            <ref target="n233-1" n="173">[233.1]</ref> a Comedy which, while we found our Account in
            keeping the Stage clear of those loose Liberties it had formerly too justly been charg'd
            with, we had laid aside for some Years. <ref target="n233-2" n="174">[233.2]</ref> The
            Author, Sir <hi rend="italic">John Vanbrugh,</hi> who was conscious of what it had too
            much of, was prevail'd upon <ref target="n233-3" n="175">[233.3]</ref> to substitute a
            new-written Scene in the Place of one in the fourth Act, where the Wantonness of his Wit
            and Humour had (originally) made a Rake <ref target="n233-4" n="176">[233.4]</ref> talk
            like a Rake in the borrow'd Habit of a Clergyman: To avoid which Offence, he clapt the
            same Debauchee into the Undress of a Woman of Quality: Now the Character and Profession
            of a Fine Lady not being so indelibly sacred as that of a Churchman, whatever Follies he
            expos'd in the Petticoat kept him at least clear of his former Prophaneness, <pb n="234"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0287"/> and were now innocently ridiculous to the Spectator.</p>
          <p>This Play being thus refitted for the Stage, was, as I have observ'd, call'd for from
            Court and by many of the Nobility. <ref target="n234-1" n="177">[234.1]</ref> Now, then,
            we thought, was a proper time to come to an Explanation with <hi rend="italic"
            >Wilks:</hi> Accordingly, when the Actors were summon'd to hear the Play read and
            receive their Parts, I address'd myself to <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>, before them
            all, and told him, That as the Part of <hi rend="italic">Constant</hi>, which he seem'd
            to chuse, was a Character of less Action than he generally appear'd in, we thought this
            might be a good Occasion to ease himself by giving it to another.&mdash;Here he
            look'd grave.&mdash;That the Love-Scenes of it were rather serious than gay or
            humourous, and therefore might sit very well upon <hi rend="italic">Booth.</hi>
            &mdash;Down dropt his Brow, and furl'd were his Features. &mdash;That if we were
            never to revive a tolerable Play without him, what would become of us in case of his
            Indispositon?&mdash;Here he pretended to stir the Fire.&mdash;That as he could
            have no farther Advantage or Advancement in his Station to hope for, his acting in this
            Play was but giving himself an unprofitable Trouble, which neither <hi rend="italic"
              >Booth</hi> or I desired to impose upon him.&mdash;Softly.&mdash;Now the Pill
            began to <pb n="235" entity="DSSR_000002933_0288"/> gripe him.&mdash;In a Word, this
            provoking Civility plung'd him into a Passion which he was no longer able to contain;
            out it came, with all the Equipage of unlimited Language that on such Occasions his
            Displeasure usually set out with; but when his Reply was stript of those Ornaments, it
            was plainly this: That he look'd upon all I had said as a concerted Design, not only to
            signalize our selves by laying him aside, but a Contrivance to draw him into the
            Disfavour of the Nobility, by making it suppos'd his own Choice that he did not act in a
            Play so particularly ask'd for; but we should find he could stand upon his own Bottom,
            and it wa snot all our little caballing should get our Ends of him: To which I answer'd
            with some Warmth, That he was mistaken in our Ends; for Those, Sir, said I, you have
            answer'd already by shewing the Company you cannot bear to be left out of any Play. Are
            not you every Day complaining of your being over-labour'd? And now, upon our first
            offering to ease you, you fly into a Passion, and pretend to make that a greater
            Grievance than t'other: But, Sir, if your being In or Out of the Play is a Hardship, you
            shall impose it upon yourself: The Part is in your Hand, and to us it is a Matter of
            Indifference now whether you take it or leave it. Upon this he threw down the Part upon
            the Table, cross'd his Arms, and sate knocking his Heel upon the Floor, as seeming to
            threaten most when he said least; but when no body persuaded him to take it up again,
              <hi rend="italic">Booth,</hi> not chusing to push <pb n="236"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0289"/> the matter too far, but rather to split the difference
            of our Dispute, said, That, for his Part, he saw no such great matter in acting every
            Day; for he believed it the wholsomest Exercise in the World; it kept the Spirits in
            motion, and always gave him a good Stomach. Though this was, in a manner, giving up the
            Part to <hi rend="italic">Wilks,</hi> yet it did not allow he did us any Favour in
            receiving it. Here I observ'd Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi> began to titter
            behind her Fan: But <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> being more intent upon what <hi
              rend="italic">Booth</hi> had said, reply'd, Every one could best feel for himself, but
            he did not pretend to the Strength of a Pack-horse; therefore if Mrs. <hi rend="italic"
              >Oldfield</hi> would chuse any body else to play with her, <ref target="n236-1"
              n="178">[236.1]</ref> he should be very glad to be excus'd: This throwing the Negative
            upon Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi> was, indeed, a sure way to save himself; which
            I could not help taking notice of, by saying, It was making but an ill Compliment to the
            Company to suppose there was but one Man in it fit to play an ordinary Part with her.
            Here Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Oldfield</hi> got up, and turning me half round to come
            forward, said with her usual Frankness, Pooh! you are all a Parcel of Fools, to make
            such a rout about nothing! Rightly judging that the Person most out of humour would not
            be more displeas'd at her calling us all by the same Name. As she knew, too, the best
            way of ending the Debate would be to help the Weak; she said, she hop'd Mr. <hi
              rend="italic">Wilks</hi> would not so far mind what had past as to refuse his acting
            the Part with <pb n="237" entity="DSSR_000002933_0290"/> her; for tho' it might not be
            so good as he had been us'd to, yet she believed those who had bespoke the Play would
            expect to have it done to the best Advantage, and it would make but an odd Story abroad
            if it were known there had been any Difficulty in that point among ourselves. To
            conclude, <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> had the Part, and we had all we wanted; which as
            an Occasion to let him see, that the Accident or Choice of one Menager's being more
            employ'd than another would never be allow'd a Pretence for altering our Indentures, or
            his having an extraordinary Consideration for it. <ref target="n237-1" n="179"
            >[237.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>However disagreeable it might be to have this unsociable Temper daily to deal with; yet
            I cannot but say, that from the same impatient Spirit that had so often hurt us, we
            still drew valuable Advantages: For as <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> seem'd to have no
            Joy in Life beyond his being distinguish'd on the Stage, we were not only sure of his
            always doing his best there himself, but of making others more careful than without the
            Rod of so irascible a Temper over them they would have been. And I much question if a
            more temperate or better Usage of the hired Actors could have so effectually kept them
            to Order. Not even <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi> (as we have seen) with all his good
            Sense, his great Fame and Experience, could, by being only a quiet Example of Industry
            himself, save his Company from falling, while neither Gentleness could <pb n="238"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0291"/> govern or the Consideration of their common Interest
            reform them. <ref target="n238-1" n="180">[238.1]</ref> Diligence, with much the
            inferior Skill or Capacity, will beat the best negligent Company that ever came upon a
            Stage. But when a certain dreaming Idleness or jolly Negligence of Rehearsals gets into
            a Body of the Ignorant and Incapable (which before <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> came
            into <hi rend="italic">Drury-Lane,</hi> when <hi rend="italic">Powel</hi> was at the
            Head of them, was the Case of that Company) then, I say, a sensible Spectator might have
            look'd upon the fallen Stage as <hi rend="italic">Portius</hi> in the Play of <hi
              rend="italic">Cato</hi> does upon his ruin'd Country, and have lamented it in
            (something near) the same Exclamation, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi></p>

          <p>The great Share, therefore, that <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>, by his exemplary
            Diligence and Impatience of Neglect in others, had in the Reformation of this Evil,
            ought in Justice to be remember'd; and let my own Vanity here take Shame to itself when
            I confess, That had I had half his Application, I still think I might have shewn myself
            twice the Actor that in my highest State of Favour I appear'd to be. But if I have any
            Excuse for that Neglect (a Fault which, if I loved not Truth, I need not have mentioned)
            it is that so much of my Attention was taken up in an incessant Labour to guard against
            our private Animosities, and preserve a Harmony in our Menagement, that I hope and
            believe it made ample Amends for whatever Omission my Auditors might sometimes know it
            cost me some pains to conceal. But Nature takes care to bestow her Blessings with a more
            equal Hand than Fortune does, and is seldom known to heap too many upon one Man: One
            tolerable Talent in an Individual is enough to preserve him from being good for nothing;
            and, if that was not laid to my Charge as an Actor, I have in this Light too, less to
            complain of than to be thankful for.</p>
          <p>Before I conclude my History, it may be expected I should give some further View of
            these my last Cotemporaries of the Theatre, <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> and <hi
              rend="italic">Booth,</hi> in their different acting Capacities. If I were to paint <pb
              n="240" entity="DSSR_000002933_0293"/> them in the Colours they laid upon one another,
            their Talents would not be shewn with half the Commendation I am inclined to bestow upon
            them, when they are left to my own Opinion. But People of the same Profession are apt to
            see themselves in their own clear Glass of Partiality, and look upon their Equals
            through a Mist of Prejudice. It might be imagin'd, too, from the difference of their
            natural Tempers, that <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> should have been more blind to the
            Excellencies of <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> than <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> was to
            those of <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>; but it was not so: <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>
            would sometimes commend <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> to me; but when <hi rend="italic"
              >Wilks</hi> excell'd, the other was silent: <ref target="n240-1" n="183">[240.1]</ref>
            <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> seem'd to think nothing valuable that was not tragically
            Great or Marvellous: Let that be as true as it may; yet I have often thought that, from
            his having no Taste of Humour himself, <ref target="n240-2" n="184">[240.2]</ref> he
            might be too much inclin'd to depreciate the Acting of it in others. The very slight
            Opinion <pb n="241" entity="DSSR_000002933_0294"/> which in private Conversation with me
            he had of <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>'s acting Sir <hi rend="italic">Harry
            Wildair,</hi> was certainly more than could be justified; not only from the general
            Applause that was against that Opinion (tho' Applause is not always infallible) but from
            the visible Capacity which must be allow'd to an Actor, that could carry such slight
            Materials to such a height of Approbation: For, though the Character of <hi
              rend="italic">Wildair</hi> scarce in any one Scene will stand against a just
            Criticism; yet in the Whole there are so many gay and false Colours of the fine
            Gentleman, that nothing but a Vivacity in the Performance proportionably extravagant
            could have made them so happily glare upon a common Audience.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>, from his first setting out, certainly form'd his manner
            of Acting upon the Model of <hi rend="italic">Monfort</hi>; <ref target="n241-1" n="185"
              >[241.1]</ref> as <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> did his on that of <hi rend="italic"
              >Betterton</hi>. But&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Haud passibus &aelig;quis:</hi> I
            cannot say either of them came up to their Original. <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> had
            not that easy regulated Behaviour, or the harmonious Elocution of the One, nor <hi
              rend="italic">Booth</hi> that Conscious Aspect of Intelligence nor requisite Variation
            of Voice that made every Line the Other spoke seem his own natural self-deliver'd
            Sentiment: Yet there is still room for great Commendation of Both the first mentioned;
            which will not be so much diminish'd in my having said they were only excell'd by such
            Predecessors, as it will be <pb n="242" entity="DSSR_000002933_0295"/> rais'd in
            venturing to affirm it will be a longer time before any Successors in Poetry came so
            near <hi rend="italic">Him</hi> as <hi rend="italic">He</hi> himself did to <hi
              rend="italic">Homer.</hi></p>
          <p>Though the Majority of Publick Auditors are but bad judges of Theatrical Action, and
            are often deceiv'd into their Approbation of what has no solid Pretence to it; yet, as
            there are no other appointed Judges to appeal to, and as every single Spectator has a
            Right to be one of them, their Sentence will be definitive, and the Merit of an Actor
            must, in some degree, be weigh'd by it: By this Law, then, <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi>
            was pronounced an Excellent Actor; which, if the few true Judges did not allow him to
            be, they were at least too candid to slight or discourage him. <hi rend="italic"
            >Booth</hi> and he were Actors so directly opposite in their Manner, that if either of
            them could have borrowed a little of the other's Fault, they would Both have been
            improv'd by it: If <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> had sometimes too violent a Vivacity;
              <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> as often contented himself with too grave a Dignity: The
            Latter seem'd too much to heave up his Words, as the other to dart them to the Ear with
            too quick and sharp a Vehemence: Thus <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> would too frequently
            break into the Time and Measure of the Harmony by too many spirited Accents in one Line;
            and <hi rend="italic">Booth,</hi> by too solemn a Regard to Harmony, would as often lose
            the necessary Spirit of it: So that (as I have observ'd) could we have sometimes rais'd
            the one and <pb n="243" entity="DSSR_000002933_0296"/> sunk the other, they had both
            been nearer to the mark. Yet this could not be always objected to them: They had their
            Intervals of unexceptionable Excellence, that more than balanc'd their Errors. The
            Master-piece of <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Othello:</hi> There
            he was most in Character, and seemed not more to animate or please himself in it than
            his Spectators. 'Tis true he owed his last and highest Advancement to his acting <hi
              rend="italic">Cato:</hi> But it was the Novelty and critical Appearance of that
            Character that chiefly swell'd the Torrent of his Applause: For let the Sentiments of a
            declaiming Patriot have all the Sublimity that Poetry can raise them to; let them be
            deliver'd, too, with the utmost Grace and Dignity of Elocution that can recommend them
            to the Auditor: Yet this is but one Light wherein the Excellence of an Actor can shine:
            But in <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> we may see him in the Variety of Nature: There the
            Actor is carried through the different Accidents of domestick Happiness and Misery,
            occasionally torn and tortur'd by the most distracting Passion that can raise Terror or
            Compassion in the Spectator. Such are the Characters that a Master Actor would delight
            in; and therefore in <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> I may safely aver that <hi
              rend="italic">Booth</hi> shew'd himself thrice the Actor that he could in <hi
              rend="italic">Cato.</hi> And yet his Merit in acting <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> need
            not be diminish'd by this Comparison.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> often regretted that in Tragedy he had not the full and
            strong Voice of <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> to command and grace his Periods with: But
              <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> us'd to say, That <pb n="244"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0297"/> if his Ear had been equal to it, <hi rend="italic"
              >Wilks</hi> had Voice enough to have shewn himself a much better Tragedian. Now,
            though there might be some Truth in this; yet these two Actors were of so mixt a Merit,
            that even in Tragedy the Superiority was not always on the same side: In Sorrow,
            Tenderness, or Resignation, <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> plainly had the Advantage, and
            seem'd more pathetically to feel, look, and express his Calamity: But in the more
            turbulent Transports of the Heart, <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> again bore the Palm, and
            left all Competitors behind him. A Fact perhaps will set this Difference in a clearer
            Light. I have formerly seen <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> act <hi rend="italic">Othello,</hi>
            <ref target="n244-1" n="186">[244.1]</ref> and <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> the <hi
              rend="italic">Earl of Essex,</hi>
            <ref target="n244-2" n="187">[244.2]</ref> in which they both miscarried: Neither the
            exclamatory Rage or Jealousy of the one, or the plaintive Distresses of the other, were
            happily executed, or became either of them; though in the contrary Characters they were
            both excellent.</p>
          <p>When an Actor becomes and naturally Looks the Character he stands in, I have often
            observ'd it to have had as fortunate an Effect, and as much recommended <pb n="245"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0298"/> him to the Approbation of the common Auditors, as the
            most correct or judicious Utterance of the Sentiments: This was strongly visible in the
            favourable Reception <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> met with in <hi rend="italic"
            >Hamlet,</hi> where I own the Half of what he spoke was as painful to my Ear as every
            Line that came from <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi> was charming; <ref target="n245-1"
              n="188">[245.1]</ref> and yet it is not impossible, could they have come to a Poll,
            but <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> might have had a Majority of Admirers: However, such a
            Division had been no Proof that the Pr&aelig;eminence had not still remain'd in <hi
              rend="italic">Betterton</hi>; and if I should add that <hi rend="italic">Booth,</hi>
            too, was behind <hi rend="italic">Betterton</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, it
            would be saying no more than <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> himself had Judgment and
            Candour enough to know and confess. And if both he and <hi rend="italic">Wilks</hi> are
            allow'd, in the two above-mention'd Characters, a second Place to so great a Master as
              <hi rend="italic">Betterton,</hi> it will be a Rank of Praise that the best Actors
            since my Time might have been proud of.</p>
          <p>I am now come towards the End of that Time through which our Affairs had long gone
            forward in a settled Course of Prosperity. From the Visible Errors of former Menagements
            we had at last found the necessary Means to bring our private Laws and Orders into the
            general Observance and Approbation of our Society: Diligence and Neglect were under an
            equal Eye; the one never fail'd of its Reward, and the other, by being very rarely
            excus'd, <pb n="246" entity="DSSR_000002933_0299"/> was less frequently committed. You
            are now to consider us in our height of Favour, and so much in fashion with the politer
            Part of the Town, that our House every <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> seem'd to be the
            appointed Assembly of the First Ladies of Quality: Of this, too, the common Spectators
            were so well appriz'd, that for twenty Years successively, on that Day, we scarce ever
            fail'd of a crowded Audience; for which Occasion we particularly reserv'd our best
            Plays, acted in the best Manner we could give them. <ref target="n246-1" n="189"
            >[246.1]</ref>
          </p>

          <p>Among our many necessary Reformations; what not a little preserv'd to us the Regard of
            our Auditors, was the Decency of our clear Stage; <ref target="n246-2" n="190"
            >[246.2]</ref> from whence we had now, for many Years, shut out those idle Gentlemen,
            who seem'd more delighted to be pretty Objects themselves, than capable of any Pleasure
            from the Play: Who took their daily Stands where they might best elbow the Actor, and
            come in for their Share of the Auditor's Attention. In many a labour'd Scene of the
            warmest Humour and of the most affecting Passion have I seen the best Actors
            disconcerted, while these buzzing Muscatos have been fluttering round their Eyes and
            Ears. How was it possible an Actor, so embarrass'd, should keep his Impatience from
            entering into that different <pb n="247" entity="DSSR_000002933_0300"/> Temper which his
            personated Character might require him to be Master of?</p>
          <p>Future Actors may perhaps wish I would set this Grievance in a stronger Light; and, to
            say the Truth, where Auditors are ill-bred, it cannot well be expected that Actors
            should be polite. Let me therefore shew how far an Artist in any Science is apt to be
            hurt by any sort of Inattention to his Performance.</p>
          <p>While the famous <hi rend="italic">Corelli,</hi>
            <ref target="n247-1" n="191">[247.1]</ref> at <hi rend="italic">Rome,</hi> was playing
            some Musical Composition of his own to a select Company in the private Apartment of his
            Patron-Cardinal, he observed, in the height of his Harmony, his Eminence was engaging in
            a detach'd Conversation; upon which he suddenly stopt short, and gently laid down his
            Instrument: The Cardinal, surpriz'd at the unexpected Cessation, ask'd him if a String
            was broke? To which <hi rend="italic">Corelli</hi>, in an honest Conscience of what was
            due to his Musick, reply'd, No, Sir, I was only afraid I interrupted Business. His
            Eminence, who knew that a Genius could never shew itself to Advantage where it had not
            its proper Regards, took this Reproof in good Part, and broke off his Conversation to
            hear the whole <hi rend="italic">Concerto</hi> play'd over again.</p>
          <p>Another Story will let us see what Effect a mistaken Offence of this kind had upon the
              <hi rend="italic">French</hi>
            <pb n="248" entity="DSSR_000002933_0301"/> Theatre; which was told me by a Gentleman of
            the long Robe, then at <hi rend="italic">Paris,</hi> and who was himself the innocent
            Author of it. At the Tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Zaire,</hi> while the celebrated
            Mademoiselle <hi rend="italic">Gossin</hi>
            <ref target="n248-1" n="192">[248.1]</ref> was delivering a Soliloquy, this Gentleman
            was seiz'd with a sudden Fit of Coughing, which gave the Actress some Surprize and
            Interruption; and his Fit increasing, she was forced to stand silent so long, that it
            drew the Eyes of the uneasy Audience upon him; when a <hi rend="italic">French</hi>
            Gentleman, leaning forward to him, ask'd him, If this Actress had given him any
            particular Offence, that he took so publick an Occasion to resent it? The <hi
              rend="italic">English</hi> Gentleman, in the utmost Surprize, assured him, So far from
            it, that he was a particular Admirer of her Performance; that his Malady was his real
            Misfortune, and if he apprehended any Return of it, he would rather quit his Seat than
            disoblige either the Actress of the Audience.</p>
          <p>This publick Decency in their Theatre I have myself seen carried so far, that a
            Gentleman in their <hi rend="italic">second Loge,</hi> or Middle-Gallery, being observ'd
            to sit forward himself while a Lady sate behind him, a loud Number of Voices call'd out
            to him from the Pit, <hi rend="italic">Place &agrave; la Dame! Place &agrave; la
              Dame!</hi> When the <pb n="249" entity="DSSR_000002933_0302"/> Person so offending,
            either not apprehending the Meaning of the Clamour, or possibly being some <hi
              rend="italic">John Trott</hi> who fear'd no Man alive; the Noise was continued for
            several Minutes; nor were the Actors, though ready on the Stage, suffer'd to begin the
            Play 'till this unbred Person was laugh'd out of his Seat, and had placed the Lady
            before him.</p>
          <p>Whether this Politeness observ'd at Plays may be owing to their Clime, their
            Complexion, or their Government, is of no great Consequence; but if it is to be
            acquired, methinks it is pity our accomplish'd Countrymen, who every Year import so much
            of this Nation's gawdy Garniture, should not, in this long Course of our Commerce with
            them, have brought over a little of their Theatrical Good-breeding too.</p>
          <p>I have been the more copious upon this Head, that it might be judg'd how much it stood
            us upon to have got rid of those improper Spectators I have been speaking of: For
            whatever Regard we might draw by keeping them at a Distance from our Stage, I had
            observed, while they were admitted behind our Scenes, we but too often shew'd them the
            wrong Side of our Tapestry; and that many a tolerable Actor was the less valued when it
            was known what ordinary Stuff he was made of.</p>
          <p>Among the many more disagreeable Distresses that are almost unavoidable in the
            Government of a Theatre, those we so often met with from the Persecution of bad Authors
            were what we could never intirely <pb n="250" entity="DSSR_000002933_0303"/> get rid of.
            But let us state both our Cases, and then see where the Justice of the Complaint lies.
            'Tis true, when an ingenious Indigent had taken perhaps a whole Summer's Pains, <hi
              rend="italic">invit&acirc; Minerv&acirc;,</hi> to heap up a Pile of Poetry
            into the Likeness of a Play, and found, at last, the gay Promise of his Winter's Support
            was rejected and abortive, a Man almost ought to be a Poet himself to be justly sensible
            of his Distress! Then, indeed, great Allowances ought to be made for the severe
            Reflections he might naturally throw upon those pragmatical Actors, who had no Sense of
            Taste of good Writing. And yet, if his Relief was only to be had by his imposing a bad
            Play upon a good Set of Actors, methinks the Charity that first looks at home has as
            good an Excuse for its Coldness as the unhappy Object of it had a Pleas for his being
            reliev'd at their Expence. But immediate Want was not always confess'd their Motive for
            Writing; Fame, Honour, and <hi rend="italic">Parnassian</hi> Glory had sometimes taken a
            romantick Turn in their Heads; and then they gave themselves the Air of talking to us in
            a higher Strain&mdash;Gentlemen were not to be so treated! the Stage was like to be
            finely govern'd when Actors pretended to be Judges of Authors, <hi rend="italic"
              >&amp;c.</hi> But, dear Gentlemen! if they were good Actors, why not? How should
            they have been able to act, or rise to any Excellence, if you supposed them not to feel
            or understand what you offer'd them? Would you have reduc'd them to the meer Mimickry of
            Parrots and Monkies, that can only <pb n="251" entity="DSSR_000002933_0304"/> prate, and
            play a great many pretty Tricks, without Reflection? Or how are you sure your Friend,
            the infallible Judge to whom you read your fine Piece, might be sincere in the Praises
            he gave it? Or, indeed, might no you have thought the best Judge a bad one if he had
            disliked it? Consider, too, how possible it might be that a Man of Sense would not care
            to tell you a Truth he was sure you would not believe! And if neither <hi rend="italic"
              >Dryden, Congreve, Steele, Addison,</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">Farquhar,</hi> (if you
            please) ever made any Complaint of their Incapacity to judge, why is the World to
            believe the Slights you have met with from them are either undeserved or particular?
            Indeed! indeed, I am not conscious that we ever did you or any of your Fraternity the
            least Injustice! <ref target="n251-1" n="193">[251.1]</ref> Yet this was not all we had
            to struggle with; to <pb n="252" entity="DSSR_000002933_0305"/> supersede our Right of
            rejecting, the Recommendation, or rather Imposition, of some great Persons (whom it was
            not Prudence to disoblige) sometimes came in with a high Hand to support their
            Pretensions; and then, <hi rend="italic">cout que cout,</hi> acted it must be! So when
            the short Life of this wonderful Nothing was over, the Actors were perhaps abus'd in a
            Preface for obstructing the Success of it, and the Town publickly damn'd us for our
            private Civility. <ref target="n252-1" n="194">[252.1]</ref>
          </p>

            Day's publick Triumph of his Muse, <pb n="253" entity="DSSR_000002933_0306"/> marching
            in a stately full-bottom'd Perriwig into the Lobby of the House, with a Lady of
            Condition in his Hand, when raising his Voice to the Sir <hi rend="italic">Fopling</hi>

            Box-keeper's real Name) Sir, we have dismiss'd, there was not Company enough to pay
            Candles. In which mortal Astonishment it may be sufficient to leave him. And yet had the
            Actors refus'd this Play, what Resentment might have been thought too severe for them?</p>
          <p>Thus was our Administration often censured for Accidents which were not in our Power to
            prevent: A possible Case in the wisest Governments. If, therefore, some Plays have been
            preferr'd to the Stage that were never fit to have been seen there, let this be our best
            Excuse for it. And yet, if the Merit of our rejecting the many bad Plays that press'd
            hard upon us were weigh'd against the few that were thus imposed upon us, our Conduct in
            general might have more Amendments of the Stage to boast of than Errors to answer for.
            But it is now Time to drop the Curtain.</p>
          <p>During our four last Years there happen'd so very little unlike what has been said
            before, that I shall conclude with barely mentioning those unavoidable Accidents that
            drew on our Dissolution. The first, that for some Years had led the way to greater, was
              <pb n="254" entity="DSSR_000002933_0307"/> the continued ill State of Health that

            <p> In leaping from 1717 to 1728, as Cibber does here, he omits to notice much that is
              of the greatest interest in stage history. Steele's connection with the theatre was of
              a chequered complexion, and it is curious as well as regrettable that an interested
              observer like Cibber should have simply ignored the great points which were at issue
              while Steele was sharer in the Patent. In order to bridge over the chasm I give a bare
              record of Steele's transactions in connection with the Patent.</p>
            <p>His first authority was a Licence granted to him and his partners, Wilks, Cibber,
              Dogget, and Booth, and dated October 18th, 1714. This was followed by a Patent, in
              Steele's name alone, for the term of his life, and three years after his death, which
              bore date January 19th, 1715. Cibber (p. 174) relates that Steele assigned to Wilks,
              Booth, and himself, equal shares in this Patent. All went smoothly for more than two
              years, until the appointment of the Duke of Newcastle (April 13th, 1717) as Lord
              Chamberlain. He seems soon to have begun to interfere in the affairs of the theatre.
              Steele, in the eighth number of "The Theatre," states that shortly after his
              appointment the Duke demanded that he should resign his Patent and accept a Licence in
              its place. This Steele naturally and rightly declined to do, and here the matter
              rested for many months. With reference to this it is interesting to note that among
              the Lord Chamberlain's Papers is the record of a consultation of the Attorney-General
              whether Steele's Patent made him independent of the Lord Chamberlain's authority.
              Unfortunately it is impossible to decide, from the terms of the queries put to the
              Attorney-General, whether these were caused by aggressive action on Steele's part, or
              merely by his defence of his rights.</p>
            <p>The next molestation was an order, dated December 19th, 1719, addressed to Steele,
              Wilks, and Booth, ordering them to dismiss Cibber; which they did. His suspension, for
              it was nothing more, lasted till January 28th, 1720. Steele, in the seventh number of
              "The Theatre," January 23rd, 1720, alludes to his suspension as then existing, and in
              No. 12 talks of Cibber's being just restored to the "Begging Bridge," that is, the
              theatre. The allusion is to an Apologue by Steele ("Reader," No. II.) which Cibber
              quotes, and applies to Steele, in his Dedication of "Ximena" to him. A peasant had
              succeeded in barricading, with his whole belongings, a bridge over which an enemy
              attempted to invade his native country. He kept them back till his countrymen were
              roused; but when the forces of his friends attacked the enemy, the peasant's property
              was destroyed in the fray and he was left destitute. He received no compensation, but
              it was enacted that he and his descendants were alone to have the privilege of <hi
                rend="italic">begging</hi> on this bridge. Cibber applies this fable to the
              treatment of Steele by the Lord Chamberlain, and there can be no doubt that this
              Dedication must have caused great offence to that official, and contributed materially
              to Cibber's suspension, though Steele declared that the attack upon his partner was
              merely intended as an oblique attack on himself. The author of the "Answer to the Case
              of Sir Richard Steele," 1720 (Nichols's ed., p. 532), says that Cibber had offended
              the Duke by an attack on the King and the Ministry in the Dedication of his "Ximena"
              to Steele. He also says that when the Chamberlain wanted a certain actor to play a
              part which belonged to one of the managers, Cibber flatly refused to allow him, and
              was thereupon silenced. (The actor is said to have been Elrington, and the part
              Torrismond; but I doubt if Elrington was at Drury Lane in 1719-20.) A recent stage
              historian curiously says that the play which gave offence was "The Nonjuror," which is
              about as likely as that a man should be accused of high treason because he sang "God
              Save the Queen!"</p>
            <p>Steele then, being made to understand that the attack on Cibber was the beginning of
              evil directed against himself, wrote to two great Ministers of State, and presented a
              Petition to the King on January 22nd, 1720, praying to be protected from molestation
              by the Lord Chamberlain. The result of this action was a revocation of Steele's
              Licence (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> his Patent specially, which is curious) dated
              January 23rd, 1720; and on the next Monday, the 25th, an Order for Silence was sent to
              the managers and actors at Drury Lane. The theatre accordingly remained closed Monday,
              Tuesday, and Wednesday, January 25th to 27th, 1720, and on the 28th re-opened, Wilks,
              Cibber, and Booth having made their submission and received a Licence dated the
              previous day.</p>
            <p>On the 4th of March following the actors of Drury Lane were sworn at the Lord
              Chamberlain's office, "pursuant to an Order occasioned by their acting in obedience to
              his Majesty's Licence, lately granted, exclusive of a Patent formerly obtained by Sir
              Richard Steele, Knight." The tenor of the Oath was, that as his Majesty's Servants
              they should act subservient to the Lord Chamberlain, Vice-Chamberlain, and
              Gentleman-Usher in Waiting. Whether Steele took any steps to test the legality of this
              treatment is doubtful; but, on the accession of his friend Walpole to office, he was
              restored to his position at the head of the theatre. On May 2nd, 1721, Cibber and his
              partners were ordered to account with Steele for his past and present share of the
              profits of the theatre, as if all the regulations from which his name had been
              excluded had never been made. This edict is signed by the Duke of Newcastle, and must,
              I fancy, have been rather a bitter pill for that nobleman. How Steele subsequently
              conducted himself, and how much interest he took in the theatre, Cibber very fully
              relates in the next few pages. After Steele's death a new Patent was granted to
              Cibber, Wilks, and Booth, as will be related further on. It may be noted here,
              however, that the date of the new Patent proves conclusively that Steele's grant was
              never superseded. The new power was dated July 3rd, 1731, but it did not take effect
              till September 1st, 1732, exactly three years after Steele's death, according to the
              terms of his original Patent.</p>

            <p> This is one of Cibber's bad blunders. The Case was heard in 1728. Genest (iii. 208)
              refers to the <hi rend="italic">St. James's Evening Post's</hi> mention of the

              an hearing in the Rolls Chapel in a Cause between Sir Richard Steele, Mr. Cibber, Mr.
              Wilks, and others belonging to Drury-Lane Theatre, which held five hours&mdash;one

              Cause went against Sir Richard Steele."&mdash;St. James's Evening Post, Feb. 17 to
              Feb. 20, 1728. In its next issue, Feb. 20 to Feb. 22, it corrects the blunder which it
              had made in attributing Cibber's speech to Wilks.</p>

              he was very well. Davies speaks highly of Boman's acting in his extreme old age

              prevarication, that, when this play was acted before George I. at Hampton-Court, about
              the year 1717, the courtiers laughed so loudly at this ministerial craft, that his
              majesty, who was unacquainted with the English language, asked the lord-chamberlain
              the meaning of their mirth; upon being informed of it, the king joined in a laugh of
              approbation." Davies adds that this scene "was not unsuitably represented by Colley
              Cibber;" but, in scenes requiring dignity or passion, he expresses an unfavourable
              opinion of Cibber's playing.</p>

              experienced a period of dulness, which was the natural result of the want of good

              the liberty of the scenes, because he had, in common with others, made merry with
              Cibber in a song, on his being appointed poet laureat; saying at the same time, he was

            <p> Charles Williams was a young actor of great promise, who died in 1731. On the
              production of Thomson's "Sophonisba" at Drury Lane, on February 28th, 1730, Cibber
              played Scipio, but was so hissed by a public that would not suffer him in tragic
              parts, that he resigned the character to Williams. (See Note <hi rend="super">1</hi>,
              vol. i. page 179.) This would seem to indicate that Williams was an actor of some
              position, for Scipio is a good part.</p>

              nodded to the Author to open his Manuscript. The Author begins to read, in which if he
              failed to please the <hi rend="italic">Corrector,</hi> he wou'd condescend sometimes
              to read it for him: When, if the play strook him very warmly, as it wou'd if he found

              would lay down his Pipe, (for the <hi rend="italic">Chancellor</hi> always smoaked
              when he made a Decree) and cry, <hi rend="italic">By G&mdash;d there is something
                in this: I do not know but it may do; but I will play such a Part.</hi> Well, when
              the Reading was finished, he made his proper Corrections and sometimes without any
              Propriety; nay, frequently he very much and very hastily maimed what he pretended to
              mend" (p. 95). The author also accuses Cibber of delighting in repulsing dramatic
              writers, which he called "Choaking of Singing birds." However, in Cibber's defence,
              Genest's opinion may be quoted (iii. 346): "After all that has been said against
              Chancellor Cibber, it does not appear that he often made a wrong decree: most of the
              good plays came out at Drury Lane&mdash;nor am I aware that Cibber is much to be

            instance."</p>

            <p> In the preface to "The Lunatick" (1705) the actors are roundly abused; but the most
              amusing attack on actors is in the following title-page: "The Sham Lawyer: or the
              Lucky Extravagant. As it was <hi rend="italic">Damnably</hi> Acted at the
              Theatre-Royal in Drury Lane." This play, by Drake, was played in 1697, and among the
              cast were Cibber, Bullock, Johnson, Haines, and Pinkethman.</p>
            <p>Bellchambers notes: "Such was the case in Dennis's 'Comic Gallant,' where one of the
              actors, whom I believe to be Bullock, is most severely handled." I think he is wrong
              in imagining Bullock to be the actor criticised. Dennis says that Falstaffe was the
              character that was badly sustained, and I cannot believe Bullock's position would
              entitle him to play that part in 1702. Genest (ii. 250) suggests Powell as the
              delinquent.</p>

            <p> Cibber's account of Booth is so complete that there is little to be added to it.
              Booth was born in 1681, and was of a good English family. He first appeared in Dublin
              in 1698, under Ashbury, but returned to England in 1700, and joined the Lincoln's Inn
              Fields Company. He followed the fortunes of Betterton until, as related by Cibber in
              Chapter XII., the secession of 1709 occurred. From that point to his retirement the
              only event demanding special notice is his marriage with Hester Santlow (see p. 96 of
              this volume). This took place in 1719, and was the cause of much criticism and
              slander, some of which Bellchambers reproduces with evident gusto. I do not repeat his
              statements, because I consider them wildly extravagant. They are fully refuted by
              Booth's will, from the terms of which it is clear that his marriage was a happy one,
              and that he esteemed his wife as well as loved her. Booth's illness, to which Cibber
              refers above, seized him early in the season of 1726-27, and though after it he was
              able to play occasionally, he was never restored to health. His last appearance was on
              9th January, 1728, but he lived till 10th May, 1733.</p>

            <p> Wilks died 27th September, 1732. He was of English parentage, and was born near
              Dublin, whither his father had removed, about 1665. He was in a Government office, but
              about 1691 he gave this up, and went on the stage. After a short probation in Dublin
              he came over to London, and was engaged by Rich, with whom he remained till about
              1695. He returned to Dublin, and became so great a favourite there, that it is said
              that the Lord Lieutenant issued a warrant to prevent his leaving again for London.
              However, he came to Drury Lane about 1698, and from that time his fortunes are closely
              interwoven with Cibber's, and are fully related by him.</p>

          <p>THE transaction to which Cibber alludes in his last paragraph is one with regard to
            which he probably felt that his conduct required some explanation. After the death of
            Steele, a Patent was granted to Cibber, Wilks, and Booth, empowering them to give plays
            at Drury Lane, or elsewhere, for a period of twenty-one years from 1st September, 1732.
              <ref target="n257-1" n="200">[257.1]</ref>
            <pb n="258" entity="DSSR_000002933_0315"/> Just after it came into operation Wilks died,
            and his share in the Patent became the property of his wife. Booth, shortly before his
            death, which occurred in May, 1733, sold half of his share for <hi rend="italic"
              >&pound;</hi>2,500, to John Highmore, a gentleman who seems to have been a typical
            amateur manager, being possessed of some money, no judgment, and unbounded vanity. In
            making this purchase Highmore stipulated that, with half of Booth's share, he should
            receive the whole of his authority; and he accordingly exercised the same power of
            control as had belonged to Booth. Mrs. Wilks deputed Mr. John Ellys, the painter, to be
            her representative, so that Cibber had to manage the affairs of the theatre in
            conjunction with a couple of amateurs, both ignorant, and one certainly presumptuous
            also. He delegated his authority for a time to his scapegrace son, Theophilus, who
            probably made himself so objectionable that Highmore was glad to buy the father's share
            in the Patent also. <ref target="n258-1" n="201">[258.1]</ref> He paid three thousand
            guineas for it, thus purchasing a whole share for a sum not much exceeding that which he
            had paid for one-half. Highmore's first purchase took place in the autumn of 1732, his
            second somewhere about May, 1733; so that, when Drury <pb n="259"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0316"/> Lane opened for the season 1733-34, he possessed
            one-half of the three shares into which the Patent was divided. Mrs. Wilks retained her
            share, but Mrs. Booth had sold her remaining half-share to Henry Giffard,<ref
              target="n259-1" n="202">[259.1]</ref> the manager of Goodman's Fields Theatre, at
            which, eight years later, Garrick made his first appearance. Highmore had scarcely
            entered upon his fuller authority when a revolt was spirited up among his actors, the
            chief of whom left him in a body to open the little theatre in the Haymarket. Shameful
            to relate, the ringleader in this mutiny was Theophilus Cibber; and, what is still more
            disgraceful, Colley Cibber lent them his active countenance. Benjamin Victor, though a
            devoted friend of Colley Cibber, characterizes the transaction as most dishonest, <ref
              target="n259-2" n="203">[259.2]</ref> and there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of
            his information or the soundness of his judgment. Davies ("Life of Garrick," i. 76)
            states that Colley <pb n="260" entity="DSSR_000002933_0317"/> Cibber applied to the Duke
            of Grafton, then Lord Chamberlain, for a new License or Patent in favour of his son; but
            the Duke, on inquiring into the matter, was so disgusted at Cibber's conduct that he
            refused the application with strong expressions of disapprobation. The seceders had of
            course no Patent or License under which to act; but, from the circumstance that they
            took the name of Comedians of His Majesty's Revels, it is probable that they received a
            License from the Master of the Revels, Charles Henry Lee. Highmore, deserted by every
            actor of any importance except Miss Raftor (Mrs. Clive), Mrs. Horton, and Bridgwater,
            was at his wits' end. He summoned the seceders for an infringement of his Patent, but
            his case, tried on 5th November, 1733, was dismissed, apparently on some technical
            pleas. He could not prevail upon the Lord Chamberlain to exert his authority to close
            the Haymarket, so he determined to try the efficacy of the Vagrant Act (12 Queen Anne)
            against the irregular performers. John Harper accordingly was arrested on 12th November,
            1733, and committed to Bridewell. On the 20th of the same month he was tried before the
            Court of King's Bench as a rogue and vagabond; but, whether from the circumstance that
            Harper was a householder, or from a decision that playing at the Haymarket was not an
            act of vagrancy, <ref target="n260-1" n="204">[260.1]</ref> he was discharged upon his
            own recognizance, <pb n="261" entity="DSSR_000002933_0318"/> and the manager's action
            failed. He had therefore to bring actors from the country to make up his company; but of
            these Macklin was the only one who proved of any assistance, and the unfortunate
            Highmore, after meeting deficiencies of fifty or sixty pounds each week for some months,
            was forced to give up the struggle.<ref target="n261-1" n="205">[261.1]</ref> Another
            amateur then stepped into the breach&mdash;Charles Fleetwood, who purchased the
            shares of Highmore and Mrs. Wilks for little more than the former had paid for his own
            portion. Giffard seems to have retained his sixth of the Patent. Fleetwood first set
            about regaining the services of the seceders, and, as the majority of them were probably
            ashamed of following the leadership of Theophilus Cibber, he succeeded at once. The last
            performance at the Haymarket took place on 9th March, 1734, and on the 12th the
            deserters reappeared on Drury Lane stage. This transaction ended Colley Cibber's direct
            interference in the affairs of the theatre, and his only subsequent connection with the
            stage was as an actor. His first appearance after his retirement was on 31st October,
            1734, when he played his great character of Bayes. During the season he acted Lord
            Foppington, Sir. <pb n="262" entity="DSSR_000002933_0319"/> John Brute, Sir Courtly
            Nice, and Sir Fopling Flutter; and on 26th February, 1735, he appeared as Fondlewife for
            the benefit of his old friend and partner, Owen Swiney.<ref target="n262-1" n="206"
              >[262.1]</ref> At the end of the season 1734-5, an arrangement was under consideration
            by which a committee of actors, including Mills, Johnson, Miller, Theo. Cibber, Mrs.
            Heron, Mrs. Butler, and others, were to rent Drury Lane from Fleetwood, for fifteen
            years, at <hi rend="italic">&pound;</hi>920 per annum; but the arrangement does not
            appear to have been carried out, and Fleetwood continued Patentee of Drury Lane until
            1744-5. </p>
          <p>The rival company, under the control of John Rich, acted at Lincoln's Inn Fields from
            18th December, 1714, to 5th December, 1732; then they removed to the new Covent Garden
            Theatre, which was opened on 7th December with "The Way of the World." For several
            seasons both companies dragged along very uneventfully, so far as the artistic
            advancement of the stage was concerned, although the passing of the Licensing Act of
            1737, already fully commended on, was an event of great historical importance.
            Artistically the period was one of rest, if not of retrogression; the methods of the
            older time were losing their meaning and vitality, and were becoming mere dry bones of
            tradition. The high priest of the stage was James Quin, a great actor, though not of the
            first order; and among the younger players perhaps the most notable was Charles <pb
              n="263" entity="DSSR_000002933_0320"/> Macklin, rough in manner as in person, but full
            of genius and a thorough reformer. Garrick was the direct means of revolutionizing the
            methods of the theatre, and it was his genius that swept away the formality and dulness
            of the old school; but it ought to be remembered that the way was prepared for him by
            Charles Macklin, whose rescue of Shylock from low comedy was an achievement scarcely
            inferior to Garrick's greatest. During this dull period Cibber's appearances must have
            had an importance and interest, which, after Garrick's advent, they lacked. </p>
          <p>In the season 1735-6 he acted Sir Courtly Nice and Bayes, and in the next season his
            play of "Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King John," a miserable mutilation of
            Shakespeare's "King John," was put in rehearsal to Drury Lane. But such a storm of
            ridicule and abuse arose when this play was announced, that Cibber withdrew it, <ref
              target="n263-1" n="207">[263.1]</ref> and it was not seen till 1745, when, the nation
            being in fear of a Popish Pretender, it was produced at Covent Garden from patriotic
            motives. </p>
          <p>Cibber's implacable foe, Fielding, was one of the ringleaders in the attack on him for
            mutilating Shakespeare; and in his "Historical Register for <pb n="264"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0321"/> 1736,"<ref target="n264-1" n="208">[264.1]</ref> in
            which Colley is introduced as "Ground-Ivy," <ref target="n264-2" n="209">[264.2]</ref>
            gives him the following excellent rebuke:&mdash;</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">"Medley.</hi> As <hi rend="italic">Shakspear</hi> is already good
            enough for People of Taste, he must be alter'd to the Palates of those who have none;
            and if you will grant that, who can be properer to alter him for the worse?" </p>
          <p>In 1738, having, as Victor says ("History," ii. 48), "Health and Strength enough to be
            as useful as ever," he agreed with Fleetwood to perform a round of his favourite
            characters. He was successful in comedy, but in tragedy he felt that his strength was no
            longer sufficient; and Victor relates that, going behind the scenes while the third act
            of "Richard III." was on, he was told in a whisper by the old man, "That he would give
            fifty Guineas to be then sitting in his easy Chair by his own Fire-side." Probably <pb
              n="265" entity="DSSR_000002933_0322"/> he never played in tragedy again until the
            production of his own "Papal Tyranny"&mdash;at least I cannot discover that he did.
            In 1740-1 he acted Fondlewife for the benefit of Chetwood, late prompter at Drury Lane,
            who was then imprisoned in the King's Bench for debt; and his reception was so
            favourable that he repeated the character a second and third time for his own
              profit.<ref target="n265-1" n="210">[265.1]</ref> Upon these occasions he spoke an
            "Epilogue upon Himself," which is given in "The Egotist" (p. 57 <hi rend="italic">et
              seq.</hi>), and forms so good an epitome of Cibber's philosophy, besides giving an
            excellent specimen of his style, that I quote it at length:&mdash;</p>

          <p>The representative of L&aelig;titia (or <hi rend="italic">Cocky</hi>) alluded to in
            this Epilogue was Mrs. Woffington, with whom stage-history has identified the "Susannah"
            of the following well-known anecdote, which I quote from an attack upon Cibber,
            published in 1742, entitled "A Blast upon <hi rend="italic">Bays</hi>; or, A New Lick at
            the Laureat." The author writes: "No longer ago than when the <hi rend="italic">Bedford
              Coffee house</hi> was in Vogue, and Mr. <hi rend="italic">Cibber</hi> was writing <hi
              rend="italic">An Apology for his own Life,</hi> there was <pb n="267"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0324"/> one Mr. S&mdash; (the Importer of an expensive <hi
              rend="italic">Hay-market</hi> Comedy) an old Acquaintance of Mr. <hi rend="italic"
              >Cibber,</hi> who, as well as he, retain'd a Smack of his antient Taste. In those Days
            there was also a fair smirking Damsel, whose name was <hi rend="italic"
            >Susannah-Maria</hi>* * *, who happen'd to have Charms sufficient to revive the decay'd
            Vigour of these two Friends. They equally pursued her, even to the <hi rend="italic"
              >Hazard of their Health,</hi> and were frequently seen dangling after her, with
            tottering Knees, at one and the same Time. You have heard, Sir, what a witty Friend of
            your own said once on this Occasion: <hi rend="italic">Lo! yonder goes</hi> Susannah <hi
              rend="italic">and the two Elders."</hi> Even Genest has applied this anecdote to Mrs.
            Woffington, but the only circumstance that lends confirmation to this view is the fact
            that Swiney (who is Mr. S&mdash;) left her his estate. Against this must be set the
            important points that Susannah Maria was not Mrs. Woffington's name, and that the joke
            depended for its neatness and applicability on the name Susannah. The narrator of the
            story, also, gives no hint that the damsel was the famous actress, as he certainly would
            have done; and, most important of all, it must be pointed out that at the period
            mentioned, that is, while Cibber was writing his "Apology," Mrs. Woffington had not
            appeared in London. The "Apology" was published in April, 1740, and had probably been

          <p>During the season 1741-2, "At the particular desire of several persons of Quality,"
            Cibber made a few appearances at Covent Garden; the purpose being, in all probability,
            to oppose the extraordinary attraction of Garrick at Goodman's Fields. In 1743-4 he
            played at the same theatre as Garrick, being engaged at Drury Lane for a round of his
            famous characters; but there is no record that Garrick and he appeared in the same play.
            For the new actor Cibber had, naturally enough, no great admiration. He must have
            resented deeply the alteration in the method of acting tragedy which Garrick introduced,
            and is always reported as having lost no opportunity of expressing his low opinion of
            the new school.<ref target="n268-1" n="215">[268.1]</ref>
          </p>
          <p>His last appearances on the stage were in direct rivalry with his young opponent. As
            has been related, Cibber's alteration of "King John," which had been "burked" in 1736-7,
            was produced, from patriotic motives, in 1745. As the principal purpose <pb n="269"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0326"/> of the alteration was to make King John resent the
            insolence of the Pope's Nuncio in a much more emphatic manner than he does in
            Shakespeare, it may easily be imagined how wretched a production Cibber's play is.
            Genest's criticism is not too strong when he says (iv. 161): "In a word, Cibber has on
            this occasion shown himself utterly void of taste, judgment and modesty&mdash;well
            might Fielding call his Ground-Ivy, and say that no man was better calculated to alter
            Shakespeare for the worse.... in the Epilogue (which was spoken by Mrs. Clive) Cibber
            speaks of himself with modesty, but in the dedication, being emboldened by the
            favourable reception of his Tragedy, he has the insolence to say '<hi rend="italic">I
              have endeavoured to make it more like a play than I found it in Shakespeare.</hi>'"
            "Papal Tyranny" was produced at Covent Garden on 15th February, 1745,<ref
              target="n269-1" n="216">[269.1]</ref>
            <pb n="270" entity="DSSR_000002933_0327"/> and, in opposition to it, Shakespeare's play
            was put up at Drury Lane, with Garrick as King John, Macklin as Pandulph, and Mrs.
            Cibber (the great Mrs. Cibber, wife of Theophilus) as Constance. Cibber's play was,
            nevertheless, successful; the profit resulting to the author being, according to Victor,
            four hundred pounds, which he wisely laid out in a profitable annuity with Lord
            Mountford. In this play Cibber made his last appearance on the stage, on 26th February,
            1745, on which day "Papal Tyranny" was played for the tenth time. "After which," says
            Victor ("History," ii. 49) "he retired to his easy Chair and his Chariot, to waste the
            Remains of Life with a chearful, contented Mind, without the least bodily Complaint, but
            that of a slow, unavoidable Decay." </p>
          <p>His state of mind was probably the more "chearful and contented" because of his
            unquestionable success in his tilt with the formidable author of "The Dunciad;" a
            success none the less certain at the time, that the enduring fame of Pope has caused
            Cibber's triumph over him to be lost sight of now. The progress of the quarrel between
            these enemies has already been related up to the publication of Cibber's "Apology" (see
            vol. i. p. 36), and on pages 21, 35, and 36 of the first volume of this edition will be
            found Cibber's perfectly good-natured and proper remarks on Pope's attacks on him.
            Whether the very fact that Cibber did not show temper irritated his opponent, I do not
            know; but it probably did so, for in the fourth book <pb n="271"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0328"/> of "The Dunciad," published in 1742, Pope had another
            fling at his opponent (line 17):&mdash;</p>

          <lg>
            <l>"She mounts the throne: her head a cloud conceal'd,</l>
            <l>In broad effulgence all below reveal'd;</l>
            <l>('Tis thus aspiring Dulness ever shines:)</l>
            <l>Soft on her lap her laureate son reclines."</l>
          </lg>

          <p> And in line 532 he talks of "Cibberian forehead" as typical of unblushing impudence. </p>
          <p>It is not surprising that this last attack exhausted Cibber's patience. He had hitherto
            received his punishment with good temper and good humour; but his powerful enemy had not
            therefore held his hand. He now determined to retaliate. Conscious of the diseased
            susceptibility of Pope to ridicule, he felt himself quite capable of replying, not with
            equal literary power, but with much superior practical effect. Accordingly in 1742 there
            appeared a pamphlet entitled "A Letter from Mr. Cibber, to Mr. Pope, inquiring into the
            motives that might induce him in his Satyrical Works, to be so frequently fond of Mr.
            Cibber's name." To it was prefixed the motto: <hi rend="italic">"Out of thy own Mouth
              will I judge thee.</hi> Pref. to the <hi rend="italic">Dunciad."</hi>
          </p>
          <p>Cibber commences by stating that he had been persuaded to reply to Pope by his friends;
            who insisted that for him to treat his attacker any longer with silent disdain might be
            thought a confession of Dulness indeed. This is a highly probable statement; for an
            encounter between the vivacious Cibber and the thin-skinned Pope promised a wealth of
              <pb n="272" entity="DSSR_000002933_0329"/> amusement for those who looked
            on&mdash;a promise which was amply fulfilled. Cibber proceeds to assure Pope that,
            having entered the lists, he will not in future avoid the fray, but reply to every
            attack made on him. <ref target="n272-1" n="217">[272.1]</ref> He confesses his vast
            inferiority to Pope, but adds: "I own myself so contented a Dunce, that I would not have
            even your merited Fame in Poetry, if it were to be attended with half the fretful
            Solicitude you seem to have lain under to maintain it; of which the laborious Rout you
            make about it, in those Loads of Prose Rubbish, wherewith you have almost smother'd your
              <hi rend="italic">Dunciad,</hi> is so sore a Proof." On page 17 of his "Letter" Cibber
            gives an interesting account of a quarrel between Pope and himself, to which he, with
            sufficient probability, attributes much of Pope's enmity. The passage is curious and
            important, so I quote it in full:&mdash; </p>
          <p>"The Play of the <hi rend="italic">Rehearsal</hi>, which had lain some few Years
            dormant, being by his present Majesty (then Prince of <hi rend="italic">Wales</hi>)
            commanded to be revived, the Part of <hi rend="italic">Bays</hi> fell to my share. To
            this Character there had always been allow'd such ludicrous Liberties of Observation,
            upon any thing new, or </p>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0330"/>
          <pb entity="DSSR_000002933_0331"/>

          <pb n="273" entity="DSSR_000002933_0334"/>
          <p>remarkable, in the state of the Stage, as Mr. <hi rend="italic">Bays</hi> might think
            proper to take. Much about this time, then, <hi rend="italic">The Three Hours after
              Marriage</hi> had been acted without Success; <ref target="n273-1" n="218"
            >[273.1]</ref> when Mr.<hi rend="italic">Bays,</hi> as usual, had a fling at it, which,
            in itself, was no Jest, unless the Audience would please to make it one: But however,
            flat as it was, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Pope</hi> was mortally sore upon it. This was the
            Offence. In this Play, two Coxcombs, being in love with a learned Virtuoso's Wife, to
            get unsuspected Access to her, ingeniously send themselves, as two presented Rarities,
            to the Husband, the one curiously swath'd up like an <hi rend="italic">Egyptian</hi>
            Mummy, and the other slily cover'd in the Pasteboard Skin of a Crocodile: upon which
            poetical Expedient, I, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Bays,</hi> when the two Kings of <hi
              rend="italic">Brentford</hi> came from the Clouds into the Throne again, instead of
            what my Part directed me to say, made use of these Words, viz. 'Now, Sir, this
            Revolution, I had some Thoughts of introducing, by a quite different Contrivance; but my
            Design taking air, some of your sharp Wits, I found, had made use of it before me;
            otherwise I intended to have stolen one of them in, in the Shape of a <hi rend="italic"
              >Mummy</hi>, and t'other, in that of a <hi rend="italic">Crocodile.</hi>' Upon which,
            I doubt, the Audience by the Roar of their Applause shew'd their proprotionable Contempt
            of the Play they belong'd to. But why am I answerable for that? I did not lead them, <pb
              n="274" entity="DSSR_000002933_0335"/> by any Reflection of my own, into that
            Contempt: Surely to have used the bare Word <hi rend="italic">Mummy</hi>, and <hi
              rend="italic">Crocodile,</hi> was neither unjust, or unmannerly; Where then was the
            Crime of simply saying there had been two such things in a former Play? But this, it
            seems, was so heinously taken by Mr. <hi rend="italic">Pope</hi>, that, in the swelling
            of his Heart, after the Play was over, he came behind the Scenes, with his Lips pale and
            his Voice trembling, to call me to account for the Insult: And accordingly fell upon me
            with all the foul Language, that a Wit out of his Senses could be capable
            of&mdash;How durst I have the Impudence to treat any Gentleman in that manner? <hi
              rend="italic">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> Now let the Reader judge by
            this Concern, who was the true Mother of the Child! When he was almost choked with the
            foam of his Passion, I was enough recover'd from my Amazement to make him (as near as I
            can remember) this Reply, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> 'Mr. <hi rend="italic"
            >Pope</hi>&mdash;You are so particular a Man, that I must be asham'd to return your
            Language as I ought to do: but since you have attacked me in so monstrous a Manner; This
            you may depend upon, that so long as the Play continues to be acted, I will never fail
            to repeat the same Words over and over again.' Now, as he accordingly found I kept my
            Word, for several Days following, I am afraid he has since thought, that his Pen was a
            sharper Weapon than his Tongue to trust his Revenge with. And however just Cause this
            may be for his so doing, it is, at least, the only Cause my Conscience can charge me
            with. Now, as I might <pb n="275" entity="DSSR_000002933_0336"/> have concealed this
            Fact if my Conscience would have suffered me, may we not suppose, Mr. <hi rend="italic"
              >Pope</hi> would certainly have mention'd it in his <hi rend="italic">Dunciad,</hi>
            had he thought it could have been of service to him? </p>
          <p>Cibber afterwards proceeds to criticise and reply to allusions to himself in Pope's
            works, some of which are in conspicuously bad taste. Cibber, of course, does not miss
            the obvious point that to attack his successful plays was a foolish proceeding on Pope's
            part, whose own endeavours as a dramatist had been completely unsuccessful, and who thus
            laid himself open to the charge of envy. Nor is this accusation so ridiculous as it may
            seem to readers of to-day, for a successful playwright was a notable public figure, and
            the delicious applause of the crowded theatre was eagerly sought by even the most
            eminent men. And again, it must be remembered that Pope's fame was not then the
            perfectly assured matter that it is now. </p>
          <p> But Cibber's great point, which made his opponent writhe with fury, was a little
            anecdote&mdash;Dr. Johnson terms it "an idle story of Pope's behaviour at a
            tavern"&mdash;which raised a universal shout of merriment at Pope's expense. The
            excuse for its introduction was found in these lines from the "Epistle to Dr.
            Arbuthnot":&mdash;</p>

          <lg>
            <l>"Whom have I hurt? has poet yet or peer</l>
            <l>Lost the arch'd eyebrow or Parnassian sneer?</l>
            <l>And has not Colley still his lord and whore?</l>
            <l>His butchers Henley? his freemasons Moore?"</l>
          </lg>

          <pb n="276" entity="DSSR_000002933_0337"/>
          <p>Cibber's anecdote cannot be defended on the ground of decency, but it is extremely
            ludicrous, and in the state of society then existing it must have been a knock-down blow
            to the unhappy subject of it. There can be little doubt that it was this pamphlet which
            Pope received on the occasion when the Richardsons visited him, as related by Johnson in
            his Life of the poet: "I have heard Mr. Richardson relate that he attended his father
            the painter on a visit, when one of Cibber's pamphlets came into the hands of Pope, who
            said, 'These things are my diversion.' They sat by him while he perused it, and saw his
            features writhing with anguish: and young Richardson said to his father, when they
            returned, that he hoped to be preserved from such diversion as had been that day the lot
            of Pope." How deeply Pope was galled by Cibber's ludicrous picture of him is manifested
            by the extraordinary revenge he took. And even now we can realize the bitterness of the
            provocation when we read the maliciously comic story of the vivacious Colley:&mdash; </p>
          <p>"As to the first Part of the Charge, the <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi>; Why&mdash;we
            have both had him, and sometimes the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> Lord; but as there is
            neither Vice nor Folly in keeping our Betters Company; the Wit or Satyr of the Verse!
            can only point at my Lord for keeping such <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> Company.
            Well, but if so! then <hi rend="italic">why</hi> so, good Mr. <hi rend="italic"
            >Pope?</hi> If either of us could be <hi rend="italic">good</hi> Company, our being
            professed Poets, I hope would be no Objection to my Lord's sometimes making <pb n="277"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0338"/> one with us? and though I don't pretend to write like
            you, yet all the Requisites to make a good Companion are not confined to Poetry! No,
            Sir, even a Man's inoffensive Follies and Blunders may sometimes have their Merits at
            the best Table; and in those, I am sure, you won't pretend to vie with me: Why then may
            not my Lord be as much in the Right, in his sometimes choosing <hi rend="italic"
            >Colley</hi> to laugh at, as at other times in his picking up <hi rend="italic"
            >Sawney,</hi> whom he can only admire? </p>
          <p>"Thus far, then, I hope we are upon a par; for the Lord, you see, will fit either of
            us.</p>
          <p>"As to the latter Charge, the <hi rend="italic">Whore,</hi> there indeed, I doubt you
            will have the better of me; for I must own, that I believe I know more of <hi

            don't recollect that ever I made you the least Confidence of <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
            Amours, though I have been very near an Eye-Witness of <hi rend="italic"
            >Yours</hi>&mdash; By the way, gentle Reader, don't you think, to say only, <hi
              rend="italic">a Man has his Whore,</hi> without some particular Circumstances to
            aggravate the Vice, is the flattest Piece of Satyr that ever fell from the formidable
            Pen of Mr. <hi rend="italic">Pope</hi>? because (<hi rend="italic">defendit
            numerus</hi>) take the first ten thousand Men you meet, and I believe, you would be no
            Loser, if you betted ten to one that every single Sinner of them, one with another, had
            been guilty of the same Frailty. But as Mr. <hi rend="italic">Pope</hi> has so
            particularly picked me out of the Number to make an Example of: Why may I not take the
            same Liberty, and even single him out for another <pb n="278"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0339"/> to keep me in Countenance? He must excuse me, then, if
            in what I am going to relate, I am reduced to make bold with a little private
            Conversation: But as he has shewn no Mercy to <hi rend="italic">Colley,</hi> why should
            so unprovok'd an Aggressor expect any for himself? And if Truth hurts him, I can't help
            it. He may remember, then (or if he won't I will) when <hi rend="italic">Button</hi>'s
            Coffee-house was in vogue, and so long ago, as when he had not translated above two or
            three Books of <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi>; there was a late young Nobleman (as much
            his <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi> as mine) who had a good deal of wicked Humour, and who,
            though he was fond of having Wits in his Company, was not so restrained by his
            Conscience, but that he lov'd to laugh at any merry Mischief he could do them: This

            one Evening slily seduced the celebrated Mr. <hi rend="italic">Pope</hi> as a Wit, and
            myself as a Laugher, to a certain House of Carnal Recreation, near the <hi rend="italic"

            what sort of Figure a Man of his Size, Sobriety, and Vigour (in Verse) would make, when
            the frail Fit of Love had got into him; in which he so far succeeded, that the smirking
            Damsel, who serv'd us with Tea, happen'd to have Charms sufficient to tempt the <pb

              >Pope</hi> into the next Room with her: at which you may imagine, his Lordship was in
            as much Joy, at what might happen within, as our small Friend could probably be in
            Possession of it: But I (forgive me all ye mortified Mortals whom his fell Satyr has
            since fallen upon) observing he had staid as long as without hazard of his Health he
            might, I, <q>Prick'd to it by foolish Honesty and Love,</q> As <hi rend="italic"
              >Shakespear</hi> says, without Ceremony, threw open the Door upon him, where I found

            upon the Mount of Love! But such was my Surprize, that I fairly laid hold of his Heels,
            and actually drew him down safe and sound from his Danger. My Lord, who staid tittering
            without, in hopes the sweet Mischief he came for would have been compleated, upon my
            giving an Account of the Actin within, began to curse, and call me an hundred silly
            Puppies, for my impertinently spoiling the Sport; to which with great Gravity I reply'd;
            pray, my Lord, consider what I have done was, in regard to the Honour of our Nation! For
            would you have had so glorious a Work as that of making <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi>
            speak elegant <hi rend="italic">English,</hi> cut short by laying up our little
            Gentleman of a Malady, which his thin Body might never have been cured of? No, my Lord!
              <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> would have been too serious a Sacrifice to our Evening
            Merriment. Now as his <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> has since been so happily <pb n="280"

            ever came to Perfection?</p>
          <p>"And now again, gentle Reader, let it be judged, whether the <hi rend="italic"

              <hi rend="italic">Colley</hi> the Criminal?</p>
          <p>"Though I confess Recrimination to be but a poor Defence for one's own Faults; yet when
            the Guilty are Accusers, it seems but just, to make use of any Truth, that may
            invalidate their Evidence: I therefore hope, whatever the serious Reader may think amiss
            in this Story, will be excused, by my being so hardly driven to tell it." </p>
          <p>In the remainder of Cibber's pamphlet there is not much that is of any importance,
            though an allusion to one of Pope's victims having hung up a birch in Button's Coffee
            House, wherewith to chastise his satirist, was skilfully calculated to rouse Pope's
            temper. Cibber thoroughly succeeded in this object, <ref target="n280-1" n="220"
            >[280.1]</ref> perhaps to a degree that he rather regretted. Pope made no direct reply
            to his banter, but in the following year (1743) a new edition of "The Dunciad" appeared,
            in which Theobald was deposed from the throne of Dulness, and Cibber elevated in his
            place. <pb n="281" entity="DSSR_000002933_0342"/> By doing this Pope gratified his
            vengeance, but injured his poem, for the carefully painted peculiarities of Theobald, a
            slow and pedantic scholar, sat ill on the pert and vivacious Colley. <ref
              target="n281-1" n="221">[281.1]</ref> TO this retaliation Cibber, as he had promised,
              <ref target="n281-2" n="222">[281.2]</ref> replied with another pamphlet, entitled
            "Another Occasional Letter from Mr. Cibber to Mr. Pope. Wherein the New Hero's
            Preferment to his Throne, in the <hi rend="italic">Dunciad</hi>, seems not to be
            Accepted. And the Author of that Poem His more rightful Claim to it, is Asserted. With
            An Expostulatory Address to the Reverend Mr. <hi rend="italic">W. W&mdash;n,</hi>
            Author of the new Preface, and Adviser in the curious Improvements of that Satire." The
            motto on the title-page was:&mdash;</p>

          <p>There is little that is of any note in this production, which is characterized by the
            same real or affected good-nature as marked the former pamphlet. The most interesting
            passages to us are those alluding to the effect of Cibber's previous attack, and
            exulting over Pope's distress at it. For instance (on page 7):&mdash; </p>
          <p>"And now, Sir, give me leave to be a little surpriz'd <pb n="282"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0343"/> at the impenetrable Skull of your Courage, that (after
            I had in my first Letter) so heartily teiz'd, and toss'd, and tumbled you through all
            the Mire, and Dirt, the madness of your Muse had been throwing at other People, it could
            still, so Vixen like, sprawl out the same feeble Paw of its Satyr, to have t'other
            Scratch at my Nose: But as I know the Vulgar (with whose Applause I humbly content my
            self) are apt to laugh when they see a curst Cat in a Kennel; so whenever I observe your
              <hi rend="italic">Grimalkin</hi> Spirit shew but the least grinning Gasp of Life, I
            shall take the honest liberty of old <hi rend="italic">Towser</hi> the House-dog, and
            merrily lift up my Leg to have a little more Game with you. </p>
          <p>"Well Sir, in plainer Terms, I am now, you see, once more willing to bring Matters to
            an Issue, or (as the Boxers say) to answer your Challenge, and come to a Trial of
            Manhood with you; though by our slow Proceedings, we seem rather to be at <hi

            and if you had not been a blinder Booby, than my self, you would have sate down quietly,
            with the last black Eye I gave you: For so loath was I to squabble with you, that though
            you had been snapping, and snarling at me for twenty Years together, you saw, I never so
            much as gave you a single Growl, or took any notice of you. At last, 'tis true, in meer
            Sport for others, rather than from the least Tincture of Concern for my self, I was

            Side, I doubt I have so offended the Gravity, and Greatness of your Soul, that to secure
            your more ample Revenge, you have prudently taken the full Term of thirteen Months
            Consideration, before you would pour it, upon me! But at last, it seems, we have it, and

          <p>And again (on page 15): "At your Peril be it, little Gentleman, for I shall have
            t'other Frisk with you, and don't despair that the very Notice I am now taking of you,
            will once more make your Fame fly, like a yelping Cur with a Bottle at his Tail, the

          </p>
          <p>To this pamphlet Pope, whose infirmities were very great, made no reply, and Cibber
            had, as he had vowed, the last word. Round the central articles of this quarrel a crowd
            of supplementary productions had gathered, a list of which will be found in the
            Bibliography of Cibber a few pages on. </p>
          <p>Cibber's position of Poet Laureate furnished him with a steady income during his
            declining years, and his Odes were turned out as required, with mechanical precision and
            most unpoetic spirit. They were the standing joke of the pamphleteers and new-sheet
            writers, and were always accompanied with a running <pb n="284"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0345"/> fire of banter and parody. Those curious in the matter
            will find excellent specimens, both of the Odes and the burlesques, in the early volumes
            of the "Gentleman's Magazine." </p>
          <p>After the termination of his quarrel with Pope, Cibber's life was very uneventful; and,
            although it extended far beyond the allotted span, he continued to enjoy it to the very
            end. Horace Walpole greeted him one day, saying, "I am glad, Sir, to see you looking so
            well." "Egad, Sir," replied the old man, "at eighty-four it is well for a man that he
            can look at all." On 11th December, 1757, he died, having attained the great age of
            eighty-six. <ref target="n284-1" n="223">[284.1]</ref> Dr. Doran ("Their Majesties'
            Servants," 1888 edition, ii. 235) says: "I read in contemporary publications that there
            'died at his house in Berkeley Square, Colley Cibber, Esq., Poet Laureate;'" and
            although it has been stated that he died at Islington, I see no reason to doubt Dr.
            Doran's explicit statement. Cibber was buried in the Danish Church, Wellclose
              Square.<ref target="n284-2" n="224">[284.2]</ref></p>

          <pb n="285" entity="DSSR_000002933_0346"/>
          <p>So far as we know, only two of Cibber's children survived him, his ne'er-do-well son
            Theophilus, and his equally scapegrace daughter Charlotte, who married Charke the
            musician. The former was born in 1703, and was drowned in the winter of 1758, while
            crossing to Ireland to fulfil an engagement in Dublin. As an actor he was chiefly famous
            for playing Ancient Pistol, but he was also excellent in some of his father's
            characters, such as Lord Foppington, Bayes, and Sir Francis Wronghead. His private life
            was in the last degree disreputable, and especially so in his relations with his second
            wife, Susanna Maria Arne&mdash;the great Mrs. Cibber. The literature regarding
            Theophilus Cibber is considerable in quantity and curious in quality. Some account of it
            will be found in my "Bibliographical Account of English Theatrical Literature," pp.
            52-55. <pb n="286" entity="DSSR_000002933_0347"/> Charlotte Charke, who was born about
            1710, and died in April, 1760, was of no note as an actress. Her private life, however,
            was madly eccentric, and her autobiography, published in 1755, is a curious and scarce
            work. </p>
          <p>Cibber's principal plays have been noted in the course of his "Apology;" but, for the
            sake of convenience, I give here a complete list of his regular dramatic

          <p>Of these, his alteration of "Richard III." had practically undisputed possession of the
            stage, until the taste and judgment of Mr. Henry Irving gave us back the original play.
              <ref target="n287-1" n="225">[287.1]</ref> But in the provinces, when <pb n="288"
              entity="DSSR_000002933_0349"/> stars of the old school play a round of legitimate
            parts, the adulterated version still reigns triumphant, and the great effect of the
            night is got in Cibber's famous line:&mdash; <q>"Off with his head! So much for
              Buckingham!"</q>
          </p>
          <p>In "The Hypocrite," a comedy still played at intervals, Cibber's "Nonjuror" survives.
            Bickerstaffe, who was the author of the alteration, retained a very large portion of the
            original play, his chief change being the addition of the inimitable Maw-worm. </p>

            its repertory Cibber's comedy of "She Would and She Would Not," and has shown in London
            as well as in New York how admirable a comedy it is. It goes without saying to those who
            have seen this company, that much of the success was due to Miss Ada Rehan, who showed
            in Hypolita, as she has done in Katharine ("Taming of the Shrew"), that she is mistress

          <p>Cibber was the cause of quite a considerable literature, mostly abusive. The following
            list, taken from my "Bibliographical Account of English Theatrical Literature" (1888),
            is, I believe, a complete catalogue of all separate publications by, or relating to,

            <q>A pamphlet of extreme rarity. Isaac Reed purchased a copy in 1769; and in 1795 he
              notes on it that, though he has had it twenty-six years, he has never seen another
              copy. Reed's copy was bought by Field for 65s., at whose sale, in 1827, Genest bought
              it for 36s.</q>

            characterising many persons of distinction....Together with an indictment exhibited
            against Alexander Pope of Twickenham, Esq; for not exerting his talents at this
            juncture: and the arraignment of George Cheyne, Physician at Bath, for the
            Philosophical, Physical, and Theological heresies, uttered in his last book on Regimen.

              The two "Letters" were reprinted, London, 1777, with, I believe, a curious
              frontispiece representing the adventure related by Cibber at Pope's expense in the
              first "Letter." I am not certain whether the frontispiece was issued with the London
              or Glasgow reprint, having seen it in copies of both. In Bohn's "Lowndes" (1865) is
              mentioned a parody on this first "Letter," with the same title, except that "Mrs.
              Cibber's name" is substituted for "Mr. Cibber's name." Lowndes says: "A copy is
              described in Mr. Thorpe's catalogue, p. iv, 1832, 'with the frontispiece of Pope
              surprized with Mrs. Cibber.'" I gravely doubt the existence of any such work, and
              fancy that this frontispiece is the one just mentioned, but wrongly described. Herman

              the old man, taking a pinch of snuff, with great nonchalance) it won't do.'" Davies
              (iii. 502) relates how Garrick drew on himself a rebuke from Cibber. Discussing in
              company the old school, "Garrick observed that the old style of acting was banishing
              the stage, and would not go down. 'How do you know? (said Cibber); you never tried

            <p> "But Pope's irascibility prevailed, and he resolved to tell the whole English world
              that he was at war with Cibber; and, to show that he thought him no common adversary,
              he prepared no common vengeance; he published a new edition of the 'Dunciad, in which
              he degraded Theobald from his painful pre-eminence and enthroned Cibber in his

            <p> It has been generally stated that Cibber died on 12th December, 1757, but "The
              Public Advertiser" of Monday, 12th December, announces his death as having occurred
              "Yesterday morning." The "Gentleman's Magazine" and the "London Magazine," in their

            <p> Mr. Laurence Hutton, in his "Literary Landmarks of London" (p. 54), gives the
              following interesting particulars regarding Cibber's last resting-place: "Cibber was
              buried by the side of his father and mother, in a vault under the Danish Church,
              situated in Wellclose Square, Ratcliff Highway (since named St. George Street). This
              church, according to an inscription placed over the doorway, was built in 1696 by
              Caius Gabriel Cibber himself, by order of the King of Denmark, for the use of such of
              his Majesty's subjects as might visit the port of London. The church was taken down
              some years ago (1868-70), and St. Paul's Schools were erected on its foundation, which
              was left intact. Rev. Dan. Greatorex, Vicar of the Parish of St. Paul, Dock Street, in
              a private note written in the summer of 1883, says:&mdash;</p>
            <q>"'Colley Cibber and his father and mother were buried in the vault of the old Danish
              Church. When the church was removed, the coffins were all removed carefully into the
              crypt under the apse, and then bricked up. So the bodies are still there. The Danish
              Consul was with me when I moved the bodies. The coffins had perished except the
              bottoms. I carefully removed them myself personally, and laid them side by side at the
              back of the crypt, and covered them with earth.'"</q>

            <p> Shakespeare's "Richard III." was produced at the Lyceum Theatre on 29th January,
              1877. It was announced as "strictly the original text, without interpolations, but
              simply with such omissions and transpositions as have been found essential for
              dramatic representation." In Richard Mr. Irving's great powers are seen to special
              advantage.</p>
