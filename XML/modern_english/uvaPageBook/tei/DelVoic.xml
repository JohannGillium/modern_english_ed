                    <p>"DR. LAVENDAR," said William King, "some time when Goliath is doing his 2.40
                        on a plank road, don't you want to pull him up at that house on the
                        Perryville pike where the Grays used to live, and make a call? An old fellow
                        called Roberts has taken it; he is a &mdash;" </p>
                    <p>"Teach your grandmother," said Dr. Lavendar; "he is an Irvingite. He comes
                        from Lower Ripple, down on the Ohio, and he has a daughter, Philippa." </p>
                    <p>"Oh," said Dr. King, "you know 'em, do you?" </p>
                    <p>"Know them? Of course I know <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0023" n="2"/> them! Do you think you are the only
                        man who tries to enlarge his business? But I was not successful in my
                        efforts. The old gentleman doesn't go to any church; and the young lady
                        inclines to the Perryville meeting-house &mdash; the parson there is a
                        nice boy." </p>
                    <p>"She is an attractive young creature," said the doctor, smiling at some
                        pleasant memory; "the kind of girl a man would like to have for a daughter.
                        But did you ever know such an old-fashioned little thing!" </p>
                    <p>"Well, she's like the girls I knew when I was the age of the Perryville
                        parson, so I suppose you'd call her old-fashioned," Dr. Lavendar said.
                        "There aren't many such girls nowadays; sweet-tempered and sensible and with
                        some fun in 'em." </p>
                    <p>"Why don't you say 'good,' too?" William King inquired. </p>
                    <p>"Unnecessary," Dr. Lavendar said, scratching Danny's ear; "anybody who <pb
                           entity="DSSR_000002486_0024" n="3"/> is amiable, sensible, and humorous <hi rend="italic">is</hi>
                        good. Can't help it." </p>
                    <p>"The father is good," William King said, "but he is certainly not sensible.
                        He's an old donkey, with his <hi rend="italic">Tongues</hi> and his <hi
                            rend="italic">Voice!"</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Dr. Lavendar's face sobered. "No," he said, "he may be an Irvingite, but he
                        isn't a donkey." </p>
                    <p>"What on earth is an Irvingite, anyhow?" William asked. </p>
                    <p>Dr. Lavendar looked at him, pityingly: "William, you are so ridiculously
                        young! Well, I suppose you can't help it. My boy, about the time you were
                        born, there was a man in London &mdash; some folks called him a saint,
                        and some folks called him a fool; it's a way folks have had ever since our
                        Lord came into this world. His name was Irving, and he started a new sect."
                        (Dr. Lavendar was as open-minded as it is possible for one of his Church to
                        be, but even he said "sect" when it came to outsiders.) <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002486_0025" n="4"/> "He
                        started this new sect, which believed that the Holy Ghost would speak again
                        by human lips, just as on the Day of Pentecost. Well, there was 'speaking'
                        in his congregation; sort of outbursts of exhortation, you know. Mostly
                        unintelligible. I remember Dr. Alexander said it was 'gibberish'; he heard
                        some of it when he was in London. It may have been 'gibberish,' but nobody
                        can doubt Irving's sincerity in thinking it was the Voice of God. When he
                        couldn't understand it, he just called it an 'unknown tongue.' Of course he
                        was considered a heretic. He was put out of his Church. He died soon after,
                        poor fellow." </p>
                    <p>"Doesn't Mr. Roberts's everlasting arguing about it tire you out?" William
                        asked. </p>
                    <p>"Oh no," Dr. Lavendar said, cheerfully; "when he talks too long I just shut
                        my eyes; he never notices it! <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0026" n="5"/> He's a gentle old soul. When I
                        answer back &mdash; once in a while I really have to speak up for the
                        Protestant Episcopal Church, &mdash; I feel as if I had kicked Danny." </p>
                    <p>William King grinned. Then he got up and, drawing his coat-tails forward,
                        stood with his back to the jug of lilacs in Dr. Lavendar's fireplace. "Oh,
                        well, of course it's all bosh," he said, and yawned; "I was on a case till
                        four o'clock this morning," he apologized. </p>
                    <p>"William," said Dr. Lavendar, admiringly, "what an advantage you fellows have
                        over us poor parsons! Everything a medical man doesn't understand is 'bosh'!
                        Now, we can't classify things as easily as that." </p>
                    <p>"Well, I don't care," William said, doggedly; "from my point of view
                        &mdash;" </p>
                    <p>"From your point of view," said Dr. Lavendar, "St. Paul was an epileptic,
                        because he heard a Voice?" </p>
                    <p>"If you really want to know what I think &mdash;" <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002486_0027" n="6"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"I don't," Dr. Lavendar said; "I want you to know what <hi rend="italic"
                        >I</hi> think. Mr. Roberts hasn't heard any Voice, yet; he is only listening
                        for it. William, listening for the Voice of God isn't necessarily a sign of
                        poor health; and provided a man doesn't set himself up to think he is the
                        only person his Heavenly Father is willing to speak to, listening won't do
                        him any harm. As for Henry Roberts, he is a humble old man. An example to
                        me, William! I am pretty arrogant once in a while. I have to be, with such
                        men as you in my congregation. No; the real trouble in that household is
                        that girl of his. It isn't right for a young thing to live in such an
                        atmosphere." </p>
                    <p>William agreed sleepily.</p>
                    <p>"Pretty creature. Wish I had a daughter just like her," he said, and took
                        himself off to make up for a broken night's rest. But Dr. Lavendar and Danny
                        still sat in front of the lilac-filled fireplace, and <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002486_0028" n="7"/> thought of
                        old Henry Roberts listening for the Voice of God, and of his Philippa. </p>
                    <p>The father and daughter had lately taken a house on a road that wandered over
                        the hills between elderberry-bushes and under sycamores, from Old Chester to
                        Perryville. They were about halfway between the two little towns, and they
                        did not seem to belong to either. Perryville's small manufacturing bustle
                        repelled the silent old man whom Dr. Lavendar called an "Irvingite"; and Old
                        Chester's dignity and dull aloofness repelled young Philippa. The result was
                        that the Robertses and their one woman servant, Hannah, had been living on
                        the Perryville pike for some months before anybody in either village was
                        quite aware of their existence. Then one day in May, Dr. Lavendar's sagging
                        old buggy pulled up at their gate, and the old minister called over the
                        garden wall to Philippa: <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0029" n="8"/> "Won't you give me some of your apple
                        blossoms?" </p>
                    <p>That was the beginning of Old Chester's knowledge of the Roberts family. A
                        little later Perryville came to know them, too: the Rev. John Fenn, pastor
                        of the Perryville Presbyterian Church, got off his big, raw-boned Kentucky
                        horse at the same little white gate in the brick wall at which Goliath had
                        stopped, and walked solemnly &mdash; not noticing the apple blossoms
                        &mdash; up to the porch. Henry Roberts was sitting there in the hot
                        twilight, with a curious listening look in his face &mdash; a look of
                        wait-ing expectation; it was so marked, that the caller involuntarily
                        glanced over his shoulder to see if any other visitor was approaching; but
                        there was nothing to be seen in the dusk but the roan nibbling at the
                        hitching-post. Mr. Fenn said that he had called to inquire whether Mr.
                        Roberts was a regular attendant at any place of worship. To which the <pb

                        and his own house was the House of God. </p>
                    <p>John Fenn was honestly dismayed at such sentiments &mdash; dismayed, and
                        a little indignant; and yet, somehow, the self-confidence of the old man
                        daunted him. It made him feel very young, and there is nothing so daunting
                        to Youth as to feel young. Therefore he said, venerably, that he hoped Mr.
                        Roberts realized that it was possible to deceive oneself in such matters.
                        "It is a dangerous thing to neglect the means of grace," he said. </p>
                    <p>"Surely it is," said Henry Roberts, meekly; after which there was nothing for
                        the caller to do but offer the Irvingite a copy of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >American Messenger</hi> and take his departure. He was so genuinely
                        concerned about Mr. Roberts's "danger," that he did not notice Philippa
                        sitting on a stool at her father's side. But Philippa noticed him. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002486_0031" n="10"
                        />
                    </p>
                    <p>So, after their kind, did these two shepherds of souls endeavor to establish
                        a relationship with Henry and Philippa Roberts.</p>
                    <p>And they were equally successful. Philippa gave her apple blossoms to the old
                        minister, &mdash; and went to Mr. Fenn's church the very next Sunday.
                        Henry Roberts accepted the tracts with a simple belief in the kindly purpose
                        of the young minister, and stayed away from both churches. But both father
                        and daughter were pleased by the clerical attentions: </p>
                    <p>"I love Dr. Lavendar," Philippa said to her father. </p>
                    <p>"I am obliged to Mr. Fenn," her father said to Philippa. "The youth," he
                        added, "cares for my soul. I am obliged to any one who cares for my soul." </p>
                    <p>He was, indeed, as Dr. Lavendar said, a man of humble mind; and yet with his
                        humbleness was a serene certainty <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0032" n="11"/> would have been impossible to
                        John Fenn, who measured every man's chance of salvation by his own
                        theological yardstick, or even to Dr. Lavendar, who thought salvation
                        unmeasurable. But then neither of these two ministers had had Henry
                        Roberts's experience. It was very far back, that experience; it happened
                        before Philippa was born; and when they came to live between the two
                        villages Philippa was twenty-four years old. . . . It was in the thirties
                        that young Roberts, a tanner in Lower Ripple, went to England to collect a
                        small bequest left him by a relative. The sense of distance, the long weeks
                        at sea in a sailing-vessel, the new country and the new people, all
                        impressed themselves upon a very sensitive mind, a mind which, even without
                        such emotional preparation, was ready to respond to any deeply emotional
                        appeal. Then came the appeal. It was that new <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002486_0033" n="12"/> gospel of the
                        Tongues, which, in those days, astounded and thrilled all London from the
                        lips of Edward Irving &mdash; fanatic, saint, and martyr! &mdash;
                        the man who, having prayed that God would speak again in prophecy, would not
                        deny the power of prayer by refusing to believe that his prayer was
                        answered, even though the prophecy was unintelligible. And later, when the
                        passionate cadences of the spirit were in English, and were found to be only
                        trite or foolish words, repeated and repeated in a wailing chant by some
                        sincere, hysterical woman, he still believed that a new day of Pentecost had
                        dawned upon a sinful world! "For," said he, "when I asked for bread, would
                        God give me a stone?" </p>
                    <p>Henry Roberts went to hear the great preacher and forgot his haste to receive
                        his little legacy so that he might hurry back to the tanyard. Irving's
                        eloquence entranced him, and it alone would have held him longer than <pb
                           entity="DSSR_000002486_0034" n="13"/> the time he had allowed himself for absence from the tannery.
                        But it happened that he was present on that Lord's Day when, with a solemn
                        and dreadful sound, the Tongues first spoke in that dingy Chapel in Regent
                        Square, &mdash; and no man who heard that Sound ever forgot it! The
                        mystical youth from America was shaken to his very soul. He stayed on in
                        London for nearly a year, immersing himself in those tides of emotion which
                        swept saner minds than his from the somewhat dry land of ordinary human
                        experience. That no personal revelation was made to him, that the searing
                        benediction of the Tongues had not touched his own awed, uplifted brow, made
                        no difference: he believed! &mdash; and prayed God to help any lingering
                        unbelief that might be holding him back from deeper knowledges. To the end
                        of his days he was Edward Irving's follower; and when he went back to
                        America it was as a <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0035" n="14"/> missionary of the new sect, that called
                        itself by the sounding title of The Catholic Apostolic Church. </p>
                    <p>In Lower Ripple he preached to any who would listen to him the doctrine of
                        the new Pentecost. At first curiosity brought him hearers; his story of the
                        Voice, dramatic and mysterious, was listened to in doubting silence; then
                        disapproved of &mdash; so hotly disapproved of that he was sessioned and
                        read out of Church.</p>
                    <p>But in those days in western Pennsylvania, mere living was too engrossing a
                        matter for much thought of "tongues" and "voices"; it was easier, when a man
                        talked of dreams and visions, not to argue with him, but to say that he was
                        "crazy." So by and by Henry Roberts's heresy was forgotten and his religion
                        merely smiled at. Certainly it struck no roots outside his own heart. Even
                        his family did not share his belief. When he married, as he did <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002486_0036" n="15"/>
                        when he was nearly fifty, his wife was impatient with his Faith &mdash;
                        indeed, fearful of it, and with persistent, nagging reasonableness urged his
                        return to the respectable paths of Presbyterianism. To his pain, when his
                        girl, his Philippa, grew up she shrank from the emotion of his creed; she
                        and her mother went to the brick church under the locust-trees of Lower
                        Ripple; and when her mother died Philippa went there alone, for Henry
                        Roberts, not being permitted to bear witness in the Church, did so out of
                        it, by sitting at home on the Sabbath day, in a bare upper chamber, waiting
                        for the manifestation of the Holy Spirit. It never came. The Tongues never
                        spoke. Yet still, while the years passed, he waited, &mdash; listening
                        &mdash; listening &mdash; listening; a kindly, simple old man with
                        mystical brown eyes, believing meekly in his own unworth to hear again that
                        Sound from Heaven, as of a rushing, mighty <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0037" n="16"/> wind, that had
                        filled the London Chapel, bowing human souls before it as a great wind bows
                        the standing corn! </p>
                    <p>It was late in the sixties that Henry Roberts brought this faith and his
                        Philippa to the stone house on the Perryville pike, where, after some months
                        had passed, they were discovered by the old and the young ministers. The two
                        clergymen met once or twice in their calls upon the new-comer, and each
                        acquired an opinion of the other: John Fenn said to himself that the old
                        minister was a good man, if he was an Episcopalian; and Dr. Lavendar said to
                        William King that he hoped there would be a match between the "theolog" and
                        Philippa. </p>
                    <p>"The child ought to be married and have a dozen children," he said; "although
                        Fenn's little sister will do to begin on &mdash; she needs mothering
                        badly enough. Yes, Miss Philly ought to be making smearkase and apple-butter
                        for <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0038" n="17"/> that pale and excellent young man. He intimated that I was
                        a follower of the Scarlet Woman because I wore a surplice." </p>
                    <p>"Now look here! I draw the line at that sort of talk," the doctor said; "he
                        can lay down the law to me, all he wants to; but when it comes to
                        instructing you &mdash;" </p>
                    <p>"Oh, well, he's young," Dr. Lavendar soothed him; "you can't expect him not
                        to know everything at his age." </p>
                    <p>"He's a squirt," said William. In those days in Old Chester middle age was
                        apt to sum up its opinion of youth in this expressive word. "We were all
                        squirts once," said Dr. Lavendar, "and very nice boys we were, too
                        &mdash; at least I was. Yes, I hope the youngster will see what a sweet
                        creature old Roberts's Philippa is." </p>
                    <p>She was a sweet creature; but as William King said, she was amusingly
                        old-fashioned. The Old Chester girl of <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0039" n="18"/> those days, who seems
                        (to look back upon her in these days) so medieval, was modern compared to
                        Philippa! But there was nothing mystical about her; she was just modest and
                        full of pleasant silences and soft gaieties and simple, startling
                        truth-telling. At first, when they came to live near Perryville, she used,
                        when the weather was fine, to walk over the grassy road, under the brown and
                        white branches of the sycamores, into Old Chester, to Dr. Lavendar's church.
                        "I like to come to your church," she told him, "because you don't preach
                        quite such long sermons as Mr. Fenn does." But when it rained or was very
                        hot she chose the shorter walk and sat under John Fenn, looking up at his
                        pale, ascetic face, lighted from within by his young certainties concerning
                        the old ignorances of people like Dr. Lavendar &mdash; life and death
                        and eternity. Of Dr. Lavendar's one certainty, Love, he was deeply ignorant,
                        this <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0040" n="19"/> honest boy, who was so concerned for Philippa's father's
                        soul! But Philippa did not listen much to his certainties; she coaxed his
                        little sister into her pew, and sat with the child cuddled up against her,
                        watching her turn over the leaves of the hymn-book or trying to braid the
                        fringe of Miss Philly's black silk mantilla into little pigtails. Sometimes
                        Miss Philly would look up at the careworn young face in the pulpit and think
                        how holy Mary's brother was, and how learned &mdash; and how shabby; for
                        he had only a housekeeper, Mrs. Semple, to take care of him and Mary. Not
                        but what he might have had somebody besides Mrs. Semple! Philippa, for all
                        her innocence, could not help being aware that he might have had &mdash;
                        almost anybody! For others of Philly's sex watched the rapt face there in
                        the pulpit. When Philippa thought of that, a slow blush used to creep up to
                        her very temples. She saw him oftener in <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0041" n="20"/> the pulpit than out of
                        it, because when he came to call on her father she was apt not to be
                        present. </p>
                    <p>At first he came very frequently to see the Irvingite, because he felt it his
                        duty to "deal" with him; but he made so little impression that he foresaw
                        the time when it would be necessary to say that Ephraim was joined to his
                        idols. But though it might be right to "let him alone," he could not stop
                        calling at Henry Roberts's house; "for," he reminded himself, "the believing
                        daughter may sanctify the unbelieving father!" He said this once to Dr.
                        Lavendar, when his roan and old Goliath met in a narrow lane and paused to
                        let their masters exchange a word or two. </p>
                    <p>"But do you know what the believing daughter believes?" said Dr. Lavendar. He
                        wiped his forehead with his red bandanna, for it was a hot day; then he put
                        his old straw hat very far back on his head <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0042" n="21"/> and looked at the
                        young man with a twinkle in his eye, which, considering the seriousness of
                        their conversation, was discomfiting; but, after all, as John Fenn reminded
                        himself, Dr. Lavendar was very old, and so might be forgiven if his mind was
                        lacking in seriousness. As for his question of what the daughter believed: </p>
                    <p>"I think &mdash; I hope," said the young minister, "that she is sound.
                        She comes to my church quite regularly." </p>
                    <p>"But she comes to my church quite irregularly," Dr. Lavendar warned him; and
                        there was another of those disconcerting twinkles. </p>
                    <p>The boy looked at him with honest, solemn eyes. "I still believe that she is
                        sound," he said, earnestly. </p>
                    <p>Dr. Lavendar blew his nose with a flourish of the red bandanna. "Well,
                        perhaps she is, perhaps she is," he said, gravely. </p>
                    <p>But the reassurance of that "perhaps" did not make for John Fenn's peace of
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0043" n="22"/> mind; he could not help asking himself whether Miss
                        Philippa <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a "believing daughter." She did not, he
                        was sure, share her father's heresies, but perhaps she was indifferent to
                        them? &mdash; which would be a grievous thing! And certainly, as the old
                        minister had declared, she did go "irregularly" to the Episcopal Church.
                        John Fenn wished that he was sure of Miss Philippa's state of mind; and at
                        last he said to himself that it was his duty to find out about it, so, with
                        his little sister beside him, he started on a round of pastoral calls. He
                        found Miss Philly sitting in the sunshine on the lowest step of the front
                        porch &mdash; and it seemed to Mary that there was a good deal of delay
                        in getting at the serious business of play; "for brother talks so much," she
                        complained. But "brother" went on talking. He told Miss Philippa that he
                        understood she went sometimes to Old Chester to church? <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002486_0044" n="23"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Sometimes," she said. </p>
                    <p>"I do not mean," he said, hesitatingly, "to speak uncharitably, but we all
                        know that Episcopacy is the handmaid of Papistry." </p>
                    <p>"Do we?" Philly asked, with grave eyes. </p>
                    <p>"Yes," said Mr. Fenn. "But even if Dr. Lavendar's teachings are defective,"
                        &mdash; Mary plucked at his sleeve, and sighed loudly; "(no, Mary!)
                        &mdash; even if his teachings are defective, he is a good man according
                        to his lights; I am sure of that. Still, do you think it well to attend a
                        place of worship when you cannot follow the pastor's teachings?" </p>
                    <p>"I love him. And I don't listen to what he says," she excused herself. </p>
                    <p>"But you should listen to what ministers say," the shocked young man
                        protested &mdash; "at least to ministers of the right faith. But you
                        should not go to church because you love ministers." <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002486_0045" n="24"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>Philippa's face flamed. "I do not love &mdash; most of them." </p>
                    <p>Mary, leaning against the girl's knee, looked up anxiously into her face. "Do
                        you love brother?" she said. </p>
                    <p>They were a pretty pair, the child and the girl, sitting there on the porch
                        with the sunshine sifting down through the lacy leaves of the two big
                        locusts on either side of the door. Philippa wore a pink and green palm-leaf
                        chintz; it had six ruffles around the skirt and was gathered very full about
                        her slender waist; her lips were red, and her cheeks and even her neck were
                        delicately flushed; her red-brown hair was blowing all about her temples;
                        Mary had put an arm around her and was cuddling against her. Yes, even
                        Mary's brother would have thought the two young things a pretty sight had
                        there been nothing more serious to think of. But John Fenn's thoughts were
                        so very serious that even <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0046" n="25"/> Mary's question caused him no
                        embarrassment; he merely said, stiffly, that he would like to see Miss
                        Philippa alone. "You may wait here, Mary," he told his little sister, who
                        frowned and sighed and went out to the gate to pull a handful of grass for
                        the roan. </p>
                    <p>Philippa led her caller to her rarely used parlor, and sat down to listen in
                        silent pallor to his exhortations. She made no explanations for not coming
                        to his church regularly; she offered no excuse of filial tenderness for her
                        indifference to her father's mistaken beliefs; she looked down at her hands,
                        clasped tightly in her lap, then out of the window at the big roan biting at
                        the hitching-post or standing very still to let Mary rub his silky nose. But
                        John Fenn looked only at Philippa. Of her father's heresies he would not, he
                        said, do more than remind her that the wiles of the devil against her soul
                        might present themselves through her natural affections; <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002486_0047" n="26"/> but in
                        regard to her failure to wait upon the means of grace he spoke without
                        mercy, for, he said, "faithful are the wounds of a friend." </p>
                    <p>"Are you my friend?" Philly asked, lifting her gray eyes suddenly. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Fenn was greatly confused; the text-books of the Western Seminary had not
                        supplied him with the answer to such a question. He explained, hurriedly,
                        that he was the friend of all who wished for salvation. </p>
                    <p>"I do not especially wish for it," Philippa said, very low. </p>
                    <p>For a moment John Fenn was silent with horror. "That one so young should be
                        so hardened!" he thought; aloud, he bade her remember hell fire. He spoke
                        with that sad and simple acceptance of the fact with which, even less than
                        fifty years ago, men humbled themselves before the mystery which they had
                        themselves created, of divine injustice. She must know, he said, <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002486_0048" n="27"
                        /> his voice trembling with sincerity, that those who slighted the offers of
                        grace were cast into outer darkness? </p>
                    <p>Philly said, softly, "Maybe." </p>
                    <p>"'Maybe?'</p>
                    <p>Alas, it is, certainly! Oh, why, <hi rend="italic">why</hi> do you absent
                        yourself from the house of God?" he said, holding out entreating hands.
                        Philippa made no reply. "Let us pray!" said the young man; and they knelt
                        down side by side in the shadowy parlor. John Fenn lifted his harsh,
                        melancholy face, gazing upward passionately, while he wrestled for her
                        salvation; Philly, looking downward, tracing with a trembling finger the
                        pattern of the beadwork on the ottoman before which she knelt, listened with
                        an inward shiver of dismay and ecstasy. But when they rose to their feet she
                        had nothing to say. He, too, was silent. He went away quite exhausted by his
                        struggle with this impassive, unresisting creature. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002486_0049" n="28"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>He hardly spoke to Mary all the way home. "A hardened sinner," he was
                        thinking. "Poor, lovely creature! So young and so lost!" Under Mary's
                        incessant chatter, her tugs at the end of the reins, her little bursts of
                        joy at the sight of a bird or a roadside flower, he was thinking, with a
                        strange new pain &mdash; a pain no other sinner had ever roused in him
                        &mdash; of the girl he had left.</p>
                    <p>He knew that his arguments had not moved her. "I believe," he thought, the
                        color rising in his face, "that she dislikes me! She says she loves Dr.
                        Lavendar; yes, she must dislike me. Is my manner too severe? Perhaps my
                        appearance is unattractive." He looked down at his coat uneasily. </p>
                    <p>As for Philly, left to herself, she picked up a bit of sewing, and her face,
                        at first pale, grew slowly pink. "He only likes sinners," she thought; "and,
                        oh, I am not a sinner!"</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER II</head>

                    <p>AFTER that on Sabbath mornings Philippa sat with her father, in the silent
                        upper chamber. At first Henry Roberts, listening &mdash; listening
                        &mdash; for the Voice, thought, rapturously, that at the eleventh hour
                        he was to win a soul &mdash; the most precious soul in his world!
                        &mdash; to his faith. But when, after a while, he questioned her, he saw
                        that this was not so; she stayed away from other churches, but not because
                        she cared for his church. This troubled him, for the faith he had outgrown
                        was better than no faith. </p>
                    <p>"Do you have doubts concerning the soundness of either of the ministers
                        &mdash; the old man or the young man?" he asked her, looking at her with
                        mild, anxious eyes. <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0053" n="30"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Oh no, sir," Philly said, smiling. </p>
                    <p>"Do you dislike them &mdash; the young man or the old man?" </p>
                    <p>"Oh no, father. I love &mdash; one of them." </p>
                    <p>"Then why not go to his church? Either minister can give you the seeds of
                        salvation; one not less than the other. Why not sit under either ministry?" </p>
                    <p>"I don't know," Philippa said, faintly. And indeed she did not know why she
                        absented herself. She only knew two things: that the young man seemed to
                        disapprove of the old man; and when she saw the young man in the pulpit,
                        impersonal and holy, she suffered. Therefore she would not go to hear either
                        man. </p>
                    <p>When Dr. Lavendar came to call upon her father, he used to glance at Philippa
                        sometimes over his spectacles while Henry Roberts was arguing about
                        prophecies; but he never asked her why she <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0054" n="31"/> stayed away from
                        church; instead, he talked to her about John Fenn, and he seemed pleased
                        when he heard that the young man was doing his duty in making pastoral
                        calls. "And I &mdash; <hi rend="italic">I</hi>, unworthy as I was!"
                        Henry Roberts would say, "I heard the Voice, speaking through a sister's
                        lips; and it said: Oh, sinner! for what, for what, what can separate,
                        separate, from the love. . . . Oh, nothing. Oh, nothing. Oh, nothing." He
                        would stare at Dr. Lavendar with parted lips. <hi rend="italic">"I heard
                        it</hi>," he would say, in a whisper. </p>
                    <p>And Dr. Lavendar, bending his head gravely, would be silent for a respectful
                        moment, and then he would look at Philippa. "You are teaching Fenn's sister
                        to sew?" he would say. "Very nice! Very nice!" </p>
                    <p>Philly saw a good deal of the sister that summer; the young minister,
                        recognizing Miss Philippa's fondness for Mary, and remembering a text as to
                        the <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0055" n="32"/> leading of a child, took pains to bring the little girl to
                        Henry Roberts's door once or twice a week; and as August burned away into
                        September Philippa's pleasure in her was like a soft wind blowing on the
                        embers of her heart and kindling a flame for which she knew no name. She
                        thought constantly of Mary, and had many small anxieties about her
                        &mdash; her dress, her manners, her health; she even took the child into
                        Old Chester one day to get William King to pull a little loose white tooth.
                        Philly shook very much during the operation and mingled her tears with
                        Mary's in that empty and bleeding moment that follows the loss of a tooth.
                        She was so passionately tender with the little girl that the doctor told Dr.
                        Lavendar that his match-making scheme seemed likely to prosper &mdash;
                        "she's so fond of the sister, &mdash; you should have heard her
                        sympathize with the little thing! &mdash; that I think she will smile on
                        the brother," he said. <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0056" n="33"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"I'm afraid the brother hasn't cut his wisdom teeth yet," Dr. Lavendar said,
                        doubtfully; "if he had, you might pull them, and she could sympathize with
                        him; then it would all arrange itself. Well, he's a nice boy, a nice boy;
                        &mdash; and he won't know so much when he gets a little older." </p>
                    <p>It was on the way home from Dr. King's that Philippa's feeling of
                        responsibility about Mary brought her a sudden temptation. They were walking
                        hand in hand along the road. The leaves on the mottled branches of the
                        sycamores were thinning now, and the sunshine fell warm upon the two young
                        things, who were still a little shaken from the frightful experience of
                        toothpulling. The doctor had put the small white tooth in a box and gravely
                        presented it to Mary, and now, as they walked along, she stopped sometimes
                        to examine it and say, proudly, how she had "bleeded and bleeded!" <pb
                           entity="DSSR_000002486_0057" n="34"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Will you tell brother the doctor said I behaved better than the circus lion
                        when his tooth was pulled?" </p>
                    <p>"Indeed I will, Mary!" </p>
                    <p>"An' he said he'd rather pull my tooth than a lion's tooth?" </p>
                    <p>"Of course I'll tell him." </p>
                    <p>"Miss Philly, shall I dream of my tooth, do you suppose?" </p>
                    <p>Philippa laughed and said she didn't know. </p>
                    <p>"I hope I will; it means something nice. I forget what, now." </p>
                    <p>"Dreams don't mean anything, Mary." </p>
                    <p>"Oh yes, they do!" the child assured her, skipping along with one arm round
                        the girl's slender waist. "Mrs. Semple has a dream-book, and she reads it to
                        me every day, an' she reads me what my dreams mean. Sometimes I haven't any
                        dreams," Mary admitted, regretfully, "but she reads all the same. Did you
                        ever dream about a black ox <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0058" n="35"/> walking on its back legs? I never
                        did. I don't want to. It means trouble." </p>
                    <p>"Goosey!" said Miss Philippa. </p>
                    <p>"If you dream of the moon," Mary went on, happily, "it means you are going to
                        have a beau who'll love you." </p>
                    <p>"Little girls mustn't talk about love," Philippa said, gravely; but the color
                        came suddenly into her face. To dream of the moon means &mdash; Why! but
                        only the night before she had dreamed that she had been walking in the
                        fields and had seen the moon rise over shocks of corn that stood against the
                        sky like the plumed heads of Indian warriors! "Such things are foolish,
                        Mary," Miss Philly said, her cheeks very pink. And while Mary chattered on
                        about Mrs. Semple's book Philippa was silent, remembering how yellow the
                        great flat disk of the moon had been in her dream; how it pushed up from
                        behind the black edge of the world, and how, suddenly, the misty
                        stubble-field was flooded with its <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0059" n="36"/> strange light: &mdash;
                        "you are going to have a beau!" </p>
                    <p>Philippa wished she might see the book, just to know what sort of things were
                        read to Mary. "It isn't right to read them to the child," she thought; "it's
                        a foolish book, Mary," she said, aloud. "I never saw such a book." </p>
                    <p>"I'll bring it the next time I come," Mary promised. </p>
                    <p>"Oh no, no," Philly said, a little breathlessly; "it's a wrong book. I
                        couldn't read such a book, except &mdash; except to tell you how foolish
                        and wrong it is." </p>
                    <p>Mary was not concerned with her friend's reasons; but she remembered to bring
                        the ragged old book with her the very next time her brother dropped her at
                        Mr. Roberts's gate to spend an hour with Miss Philippa. There had to be a
                        few formal words between the preacher and the sinner before Mary had entire
                        possession of her play- <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0060" n="37"/> mate, but when her brother drove away,
                        promising to call for her later in the afternoon, she became so engrossed in
                        the important task of picking hollyhock seeds that she quite forgot the
                        dream-book. The air was hazy with autumn, and full of the scent of fallen
                        leaves and dew-drenched grass and of the fresh tan-bark on the garden paths.
                        On the other side of the road was a corn-field, where the corn stood in
                        great shocks. Philly looked over at it, and drew a quick breath, &mdash;
                        her dream! </p>
                    <p>"Did you bring that foolish book?" she said. </p>
                    <p>Mary, slapping her pocket, laughed loudly. "I 'most forgot! Yes, ma'am; I got
                        it. I'll show what it says about the black ox &mdash;" </p>
                    <p>"No; you needn't," Miss Philly said; "you pick some more seeds for me, and
                        I'll &mdash; just look at it." She touched the stained old book with
                        shrinking fingertips; the moldering leather cover and the <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002486_0061" n="38"/> odor
                        of soiled and thumb-marked leaves offended her. The first page was folded
                        over, and when she spread it out, the yellowing paper cracked along its
                        ancient creases; it was a map, with the signs of the Zodiac; in the middle
                        was a single verse:</p>

                    <lg type="stanza">

                        <l>And the fate of dreams discern?</l>
                        <l>Wouldst thou ope the Curtain dark</l>

                        <l>What the vision has decreed.</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>Philly, holding her red lip between her teeth, turned the pages: </p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">"Money. To dream of finding money; mourning and loss</hi>. </p>

                    <p>She shut the book sharply, then <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0062" n="39"/> opened it again. Such books
                        sometimes told (so foolishly!) of charms which would bring love. She looked
                        furtively at Mary; but the child, pulling down a great hollyhock to pick the
                        fuzzy yellow disks, was not noticing Miss Philly's interest in the "foolish
                        book." Philippa turned over the pages. Yes; the charms were there! . . . </p>
                    <p>Instructions for making dumb-cake, to cut which reveals a lover: <hi
                            rend="italic">"Any number of young females shall take a handful of

                        wishes</hi>." Philippa sighed. Not that. A holy man does not "wish" for a

                    <p><hi rend="italic">"A charm to charm a man's love</hi>." The blood suddenly
                        ran tingling in Philly's veins. <hi rend="italic">"Let a young maid pick of

                        drawn through this <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0063" n="40"/> last word, and another word written above
                        it; but the ink was so faded, the page so woolly and thin with use, that it
                        was impossible to decipher the correction; perhaps it was "mother-wort," an
                        herb Philly did not know; or it might be "mandrake"? It looked as much like
                        one as the other, the writing was so blurred and dim. "It is best to take
                        what the book says," Philly said, simply; "besides, I haven't those other
                        things in the garden, and I have monk's-hood and rosemary &mdash; if I
                        should want to do it, just for fun." </p>

                    <p>"SOMEBODY making herb tea and stealing my business?" said William King, in
                        his kindly voice; he had called to see old Hannah, who had been laid up for
                        a day or two, and he stopped at the kitchen door to look in. Henry Roberts,
                        coming from the sitting-room to join him, asked his question, too: </p>
                    <p>"What is this smell of herbs, Philippa? Are you making a drink for Han-nah?" </p>
                    <p>"Oh no, father," Philly said, briefly, her face very pink. </p>
                    <p>William King sniffed and laughed. "Ah, I see you don't give away your secrets
                        to a rival," he said; and added, pleasantly, "but don't give your tea <pb
                           entity="DSSR_000002486_0066" n="43"/> to Hannah without telling me what it is." </p>
                    <p>Miss Philippa said, dutifully, "Oh no, sir." But she did not tell him what
                        the "tea" was, and certainly she offered none of it to old Hannah. All that
                        day there was a shy joyousness about her, with sudden soft blushes, and once
                        or twice a little half-frightened laugh; there was a puzzled look, too, in
                        her face, as if she was not quite sure just what she was going to do, or
                        rather, how she was going to do it. And, of course, that was the difficulty.
                        How could she "add the philter to the drink of one who loved her not"? </p>
                    <p>Yet it came about simply enough. John Fenn had lately felt it borne in upon
                        him that it was time to make another effort to deal with Henry Roberts;
                        perhaps, he reasoned, to show concern about the father's soul might touch
                        the daughter's hardened heart. It was when he reached this conclusion that
                        he <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0067" n="44"/> committed the extravagance of buying a new coat. So it
                        happened that that very afternoon, while the house was still pungent with
                        the scent of steeping herbs, he came to Henry Roberts's door, and knocked
                        solemnly, as befitted his errand; (but as he heard her step in the hall he
                        passed an anxious hand over a lapel of the new coat). Her father, she said,
                        was not at home; would Mr. Fenn come in and wait for him? Mr. Fenn said he
                        would. And as he always tried, poor boy! to be instant in season and out of
                        season, he took the opportunity, while he waited for her father and she
                        brought him a glass of wine and a piece of cake, to reprove her again for
                        absence from church. But she was so meek that he found it hard to inflict
                        those "faithful wounds" which should prove his friendship for her soul; she
                        sat before him on the slippery horsehair sofa in the parlor, her hands
                        locked tightly <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0068" n="45"/> together in her lap, her eyes downcast, her
                        voice very low and trembling. She admitted her backslidings: she
                        acknowl-edged her errors; but as for coming to church &mdash; she shook
                        her head: </p>
                    <p>"Please, I won't come to church yet." </p>
                    <p>"You mean you will come, sometime?" </p>
                    <p>"Yes; sometime." </p>
                    <p>"Behold, <hi rend="italic">now</hi> is the accepted time!" </p>
                    <p>"I will come . . . afterwards." </p>
                    <p>"After what?" he insisted. </p>
                    <p>"After &mdash;" she said, and paused. Then suddenly lifted bold,
                        guileless eyes: "After you stop caring for my soul." </p>
                    <p>John Fenn caught his breath. Something, he did not know what, seemed to jar
                        him rudely from that pure desire for her salvation; he said, stumblingly,
                        that he would <hi rend="italic">always</hi> care for her soul! &mdash;
                        "for &mdash; for any one's soul." And was she quite well? His voice
                        broke with <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0069" n="46"/> tenderness. She must be careful to avoid the chill
                        of these autumnal afternoons; "you are pale," he said, passionately
                        &mdash; "don't &mdash; oh, don't be so pale!" It occurred to him
                        that if she waited for him "not to care" for her salvation, she might die in
                        her sins; die before coming to the gate of heaven, which he was so anxious
                        to open to her! </p>
                    <p>Philippa did not see his agitation; she was not looking at him. She only
                        said, softly, "Perhaps you will stay to tea?" </p>
                    <p>He answered quickly that he would be pleased to do so. In the simplicity of
                        his saintly egotism it occurred to him that the religious pleasure of
                        entertaining him might be a means of grace to her. When she left him in the
                        dusk of the chilly room to go and see to the supper, he fell into silent
                        prayer for the soul that did not desire his care. </p>
                    <p>Henry Roberts, summoned by his <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0070" n="47"/> daughter to entertain the guest
                        until supper was ready, found him sitting in the darkness of the parlor; the
                        old man was full of hospitable apologies for his Philippa's forgetfulness;
                        "she did not remember the lamp!" he lamented; and making his way through the
                        twilight of the room, he took off the prism-hung shade of the tall astral
                        lamp on the center-table, and fumbled for a match to light the charred and
                        sticky wick; there were very few occasions in this plain household when it
                        was worth while to light the best lamp! This was one of them, for in those
                        days the office dignified the man to a degree that is hardly understood now.
                        But Henry Roberts's concern was not entirely a matter of social propriety;
                        it was a desire to propitiate this young man who was living in certain
                        errors of belief, so that he would be in a friendly attitude of mind and
                        open to the arguments which were always burning on the lips of <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002486_0071" n="48"/>
                        Edward Irving's follower. He did not mean to begin them until they were at
                        supper; so he and John Fenn sat in silence waiting Philippa's summons to the
                        dining-room. Neither of them had any small talk; Mr. Roberts was making sure
                        that he could trust his memory to repeat those wailing cadences of the
                        Voice, and John Fenn, still shaken by something he could not understand that
                        had been hidden in what he understood too well &mdash; a sinner's
                        indifference to grace &mdash; was trying to get back to his serene,
                        impersonal arrogance. </p>
                    <p>As for Philippa, she was frightened at her temerity in having invited the
                        minister to a Hannahless supper; her flutter of questions as to "what" and
                        "how" brought the old woman from her bed, in spite of the girl's
                        half-hearted protests that she "mustn't think of getting up! Just tell me
                        what to do," she implored, "I can manage. We are going to have &mdash;
                            <hi rend="italic">tea!"</hi>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0072" n="49"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"We always have tea," Hannah said, sourly; yet she was not really sour, for,
                        like William King and Dr. Lavendar, Hannah had discerned possibilities in
                        the Rev. John Fenn's pastoral visits. "Get your Sunday-go-to-meeting dress
                        on," she commanded, hunching a shawl over a rheumatic shoulder and
                        motion-ing the girl out of the kitchen. </p>
                    <p>Philippa, remorseful and breathless, ran quickly up to her room to put on her
                        best frock, smooth her shining hair down in two loops over her ears, and pin
                        her one adornment, a flat gold brooch, on the bosom of her dress. She lifted
                        her candle and looked at herself in the black depths of the little swinging
                        glass on her high bureau, and her face fell into sudden wistful lines. "Oh,
                        I do not look wicked," she thought, despairingly. </p>
                    <p>John Fenn, glancing at her across the supper-table, had some such thought
                        himself; how strange that one who was <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0073" n="50"/> so perverted in belief
                        should not betray perversion in her countenance. "On the contrary, her face
                        is pleasing," he said, simply. He feared, noticing the brooch, that she was
                        vain, as well as indifferent to her privileges; he wondered if she had
                        observed his new coat. </p>
                    <p>Philippa's vanity did not, at any rate, give her much courage; she scarcely
                        spoke, except to ask him whether he took cream and sugar in his tea. When
                        she handed his cup to him, she said, very low, "Will you taste it, and see
                        if it is right?" </p>
                    <p>He was so conscious of the tremor of her voice and hand that he made haste to
                        reassure her, sipping his tea with much politeness of manner; as he did so,
                        she said, suddenly, and with compelling loudness, "Is it &mdash;
                        agreeable?" </p>
                    <p>John Fenn, startled, looked at her over the rim of his cup. "Very; very
                        indeed," he said, quickly. But he instantly drank some water. "It is, <pb
                           entity="DSSR_000002486_0074" n="51"/> perhaps, a little strong," he said, blinking. Then, having
                        qualified his politeness for conscience' sake, he drank all the bitter tea
                        for human kindness' sake &mdash; for evidently Miss Philippa had taken
                        pains to give him what he might like. After that she did not speak, but her
                        face grew very rosy while she sat in silence listening to her father and
                        their guest. Henry Roberts forgot to eat, in the passion of his theological
                        arguments, but as supper proceeded he found his antagonist less alert than
                        usual; the minister defended his own doctrines instead of attacking those of
                        his host; he even admitted, a little listlessly, that if the Power fell upon
                        him, if he himself spoke in a strange tongue, then perhaps he would believe
                        &mdash; "that is, if I could be sure I was not out of my mind at the
                        time," he qualified, dully. Philippa took no part in the discussion; it
                        would not have been thought becoming in her to do so; but indeed, she hardly
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0075" n="52"/> heard what the two men were saying. She helped old Hannah
                        carry away the dishes, and then sat down by the table and drew the lamp near
                        her so that she could sew; she sat there smiling a little, dimpling even,
                        and looking down at her seam; she did not notice that John Fenn was being
                        worsted, or that once he failed altogether to reply, and sat in unprotesting
                        silence under Henry Roberts's rapt remembrances. A curious blackness had
                        settled under his eyes, and twice he passed his hand across his lips. </p>
                    <p>"They are numb," he said, in surprised apology to his host. A moment later he
                        shivered violently, beads of sweat burst out on his forehead, and the color
                        swept from his face. He started up, staring wildly about him; he tried to
                        speak, but his words stumbled into incoherent babbling. It was all so
                        sudden, his rising, then falling back into his chair, then <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002486_0076" n="53"/>
                        slipping sidewise and crumpling up upon the floor, all the while stammering
                        unmeaning words &mdash; that Henry Roberts sat looking at him in dumb
                        amazement. It was Philippa who cried out and ran forward to help him, then
                        stopped midway, her hands clutched together at her throat, her eyes dilating
                        with a horror that seemed to paralyze her so that she was unable to move to
                        his assistance. The shocked silence of the moment was broken by Fenn's
                        voice, trailing on and on, in totally unintelligible words. </p>
                    <p>Henry Roberts, staring open-mouthed, suddenly spoke: "The <hi rend="italic"
                            >Voice!"</hi> he said. </p>
                    <p>But Philippa, as though she were breaking some invisible bond that held her,
                        groaning even with the effort of it, said, in a whisper: "No. Not that. He
                        is dying. Don't you see? That's what it is. He is dying." </p>
                    <p>Her father, shocked from his ecstasy, ran to John Fenn's side, trying to lift
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0077" n="54"/> him and calling upon him to say what was the matter. </p>
                    <p>"He is going to die," said Philippa, monotonously. </p>
                    <p>Henry Roberts, aghast, calling loudly to old Hannah, ran to the kitchen and
                        brought back a great bowl of hot water. "Drink it!" he said. "Drink it, I
                        tell ye! I believe you're poisoned!" </p>
                    <p>And while he and Hannah bent over the unconscious young man, Philippa seemed
                        to come out of her trance; slowly, with upraised hands, and head bent upon
                        her breast, she stepped backward, backward, out of the room, out of the
                        house. On the doorstep, in the darkness, she paused and listened for several
                        minutes to certain dreadful sounds in the house. Then, suddenly, a passion
                        of purpose swept the daze of horror away. </p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">"He shall not die</hi>," she said. </p>
                    <p>She flung her skirt across her arm that her feet might not be hampered, <pb
                           entity="DSSR_000002486_0078" n="55"/> and fled down the road toward Old Chester. It was very dark. At
                        first her eyes, still blurred with the lamplight, could not distinguish the
                        footpath, and she stumbled over the grassy border into the wheel-ruts; then,
                        feeling the loose dust under her feet, she ran and ran and ran. The blood
                        began to sing in her ears; once her throat seemed to close so that she could
                        not breathe, and for a moment she had to walk, &mdash; but her hands,
                        holding up her skirts, trembled with terror at the delay. The road was very
                        dark under the sycamore-trees; twice she tripped and fell into the brambles
                        at one side or against a gravelly bank on the other. But stumbling somehow
                        to her feet, again she ran and ran and ran. The night was very still; she
                        could hear her breath tearing her throat; once she felt something hot and
                        salty in her mouth; it was then she had to stop and walk for a little space
                        &mdash; she must walk <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0079" n="56"/> or fall down! And she could not fall
                        down, no! no! no! he would die if she fell down! Once a figure loomed up in
                        the haze, and she caught the glimmer of an inquisitive eye. "Say," a man's
                        voice said, "where are you bound for?" There was something in the tone that
                        gave her a stab of fright; for a minute or two her feet seemed to fly, and
                        she heard a laugh behind her in the darkness: "What's your hurry?" the voice
                        called after her. And still she ran. But she was saying to herself that she
                        must <hi rend="italic">stop;</hi> she must stand still &mdash; just for
                        a moment. "Oh, just for a minute?" her body whimperingly entreated; she
                        would not listen to it! She must not listen, even though her heart burst
                        with the strain. But her body had its way, and she fell into a walk,
                        although she was not aware of it. In a gasping whisper she was saying, over
                        and over: "Doctor, hurry; he'll die; hurry; I killed him." She tried to be
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0080" n="57"/> silent, but her lips moved mechanically. "Doctor, hurry;
                        he'll &mdash; Oh, I <hi rend="italic">mustn't</hi> talk!" she told
                        herself, "it takes my breath" &mdash; but still her lips moved. She
                        began to run, heavily. "I can't talk &mdash; if &mdash; I
                        &mdash; run &mdash;" It was then that she saw a glimmer of light and
                        knew that she was almost in Old Chester. Very likely she would have fallen
                        if she had not seen that far-off window just when she did. </p>
                    <p>At William King's house she dropped against the door, her fingers still
                        clinging to the bell. She was past speaking when the doctor lifted her and
                        carried her into the office. "No; don't try to tell me what it is," he said;
                        "I'll put Jinny into the buggy, and we'll get back in a jiffy. I understand;
                        Hannah is worse." "Not . . . Hannah &mdash;" </p>
                    <p>"Your father?" he said, picking up his medicine-case. </p>
                    <p>"Not father; Mr. &mdash; Fenn &mdash;" <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0081" n="58"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>As the doctor hurried out to the stable to hitch up he bade his wife put
                        certain remedies into his bag, &mdash; "and look after that child," he
                        called over his shoulder to his efficient Martha. She was so efficient that
                        when he had brought Jinny and the buggy to the door, Philly was able to gasp
                        out that Mr. Fenn was sick. "Dying." </p>
                    <p>"Don't try to talk," he said again, as he helped her into the buggy. But
                        after a while she was able to tell him, hoarsely: </p>
                    <p>"I wanted him to love me." William King was silent. "I used a charm. It was
                        wicked." </p>
                    <p>"Come, come; not wicked," said the doctor; "a little foolish, perhaps. A new
                        frock, and a rose in your hair, and a smile at another man, would be enough
                        of a charm, my dear." </p>
                    <p>Philippa shook her head. "It was not enough. I wore my best frock, and I went
                        to Dr. Lavendar's church &mdash;" <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0082" n="59"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Good gracious!" said William King. </p>
                    <p>"They were not enough. So I used a charm. I made a drink &mdash;" </p>
                    <p>"Ah!" said the doctor, frowning. "What was in the drink, Miss Philly?" </p>
                    <p>"Perhaps it was not the right herb," she said; "it may have been
                        'mother-wort'; but the book said 'monk'shood,' and I &mdash;" </p>
                    <p>William King reached for his whip and cut Jinny across the flanks. <hi
                            rend="italic">"Aconite!"</hi> he said under his breath, while Jinny
                        leaped forward in shocked astonishment. </p>
                    <p>"Will he live?" said Philippa. </p>
                    <p>Dr. King, flecking Jinny again, and letting his reins hang over the
                        dashboard, could not help putting a comforting arm around her. "I hope so,"
                        he said; "I hope so!" After all, there was no use telling the child that
                        probably by this time her lover was either dead or getting better. "It's his
                        own fault," William King thought, angrily. <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0083" n="60"/> "Why in thunder
                        didn't he fall in love like a man, instead of making the child resort to
                        &mdash; G'on, Jinny! G'on!" </p>
                    <p>He still had the whip in his hand when they drew up at the gate.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER IV</head>

                    <p>WHEN Philippa Roberts had fled out into the night for help, her father and
                        old Hannah were too alarmed to notice her absence. They went hurrying back
                        and forth with this remedy and that. Again and again they were ready to give
                        up; once Henry Roberts said, "He is gone!" and once Hannah began to cry, and
                        said, "Poor lad, poor boy!" Yet each made one more effort, their shadows
                        looming gigantic against the walls or stretching across the ceiling, bending
                        and sinking as they knelt beside the poor young man, who by that time was
                        beyond speech. So the struggle went on. But little by little life began to
                        gain. John Fenn's eyes opened. Then he smiled. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002486_0085" n="62"/> Then he said
                        something &mdash; they could not hear what. </p>
                    <p>"Bless the Lord!" said Henry Roberts. </p>
                    <p>"He's asking for Philly," said old Hannah. By the time the doctor and
                        Philippa reached the house the shadow of death had lifted. </p>
                    <p>"It must have been poison," Mr. Roberts told the doctor. "When he gets over
                        it he will tell us what it was." </p>
                    <p>"I don't believe he will," said William King; he was holding Fenn's wrist
                        between his firm fingers, and then he turned up a fluttering eyelid and
                        looked at the still dulled eye. </p>
                    <p>Philippa, kneeling on the other side of John Fenn, said loudly: <hi
                            rend="italic">"I</hi> will tell <hi rend="italic">him</hi> &mdash;
                        and perhaps God will forgive me." </p>
                    <p>The doctor, glancing up at her, said: "No, you won't &mdash; anyhow at
                        present. Take that child up-stairs, Hannah," he commanded, "and put her to
                        bed. She ran all the way to Old Chester to <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0086" n="63"/> get me," he
                        explained to Henry Roberts. </p>
                    <p>Before he left the house that night he sat for a few minutes at Philippa's
                        bedside. "My dear little girl," he said, in his kind, sensible voice, "the
                        best thing to do is to forget it. It was a foolish thing to do &mdash;
                        that charm business; but happily no harm is done. Now say nothing about it,
                        and never do it again." </p>
                    <p>Philippa turned her shuddering face away. "Do it again? <hi rend="italic"
                            >Oh!"</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>As William King went home he apologized to Jinny for that cut across her
                        flanks by hanging the reins on the overhead hook, and letting her plod along
                        at her own pleasure. He was saying to himself that he hoped he had done
                        right to tell the child to hold her tongue. "It was just tomfoolery," he
                        argued; "there was no sin about it, so confession wouldn't do her any good;
                        on the contrary, it would hurt a girl's self-respect to have a man know she
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0087" n="64"/> had tried to catch him. But what a donkey he was not to
                        see. . . . Oh yes; I'm sure I'm right," said William King. "I wonder how Dr.
                        Lavendar would look at it?" </p>
                    <p>Philippa, at any rate, was satisfied with his advice. Perhaps the story of
                        what she had done might have broken from her pale lips had her father asked
                        any questions; but Henry Roberts had retreated into troubled silence. There
                        had been one wonderful moment when he thought that at last his faith was to
                        be justified and by the unbeliever himself! and he had cried out, with a
                        passion deferred for more than thirty years: "The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Voice!"</hi> But behold, the voice, babbling and meaningless, was nothing
                        but sickness. No one could guess what the shock of that disappointment was.
                        He was not able even to speak of it. So Philippa was asked no awkward
                        questions, and her self-knowledge burned deep into her heart. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002486_0088" n="65"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>In the next few days, while the minister was slowly recovering in the great
                        four-poster in Henry Roberts's guestroom, she listened to Hannah's
                        speculations as to the cause of his attack, and expressed no opinion. She
                        was dumb when John Fenn tried to tell her how grateful he was to her for
                        that terrible run through the darkness for his sake. </p>
                    <p>"You should not be grateful," she said, at last, in a whisper. </p>
                    <p>But he was grateful; and, furthermore, he was very happy in those days of
                        slow recovery. The fact was that that night, when he had been so near death,
                        he had heard Philippa, in his first dim moments of returning consciousness,
                        stammering out those distracted words: "Perhaps God will forgive me." To
                        John Fenn those words meant the crowning of all his efforts: she had
                        repented! </p>
                    <p>"Truly," he said, lying very white and feeble on his pillow and looking <pb
                           entity="DSSR_000002486_0089" n="66"/> into Philly's face when she brought him his gruel, "truly, </p>
                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"He moves in a mysterious way</l>
                        <l>His wonders to perform!"</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>The "mysterious way" was the befalling of that terrible illness in Henry
                        Roberts's house, so that Philippa should be impressed by it. "If my
                        affliction has been blessed to any one else, I am glad to have suffered it,"
                        he said. </p>
                    <p>Philippa silently put a spoonful of gruel between his lips; he swallowed it
                        as quickly as he could. </p>
                    <p>"I heard you call upon God for forgiveness; the Lord is merciful and
                        gracious!" </p>
                    <p>Philly said, very low, "Yes; oh <hi rend="italic">yes</hi>." </p>
                    <p>So John Fenn thanked God and took his gruel, and thought it was very good. He
                        thought, also, that Miss Philippa was very good to be so good to him. In
                        those next few days, before he was strong enough to be moved back to his own

                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0092" n="67"/> house, he thought more of her goodness and less of her salvation. It
                        was then that he had his great moment, his revealing moment! All of a
                        sudden, at the touch of Life, his honest artificiality had dropped from him,
                        and he knew that he had never before known anything worth knowing! He knew
                        he was in love. He knew it when he realized that he was not in the least
                        troubled about her soul. "That is what she meant!" he thought; "she wanted
                        me to care for her, before I cared for her soul." He was so simple in his
                        acceptance of the revelation that she loved him, that when he went to ask
                        her to be his wife the blow of her reply almost knocked him back into his
                        ministerial affectations: </p>
                    <p>"No." </p>
                    <p>When John Fenn got home that evening he went into his study and shut the
                        door. Mary came and pounded on it, but he only said, in a muffled voice: <pb
                           entity="DSSR_000002486_0093" n="68"/> "No, Mary. Not now. Go away." He was praying for resignation to
                        what he told himself was the will of God. "The Lord is unwilling that my
                        thoughts should be diverted from His service by my own personal happiness."
                        Then he tried to put his thoughts on that service by deciding upon a text
                        for his next sermon. But the texts which suggested themselves were not
                        steadying to his bewildered mind: </p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">"Love one another</hi>." ("I certainly thought she loved
                        me.") </p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">"Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you</hi>." ("I
                        am, perhaps, personally unattractive to her; and yet I wonder why?") </p>
                    <p>He was not a conceited man; but, like all his sex, he really did "marvel" a
                        little at the lack of feminine appreciation. </p>
                    <p>He marveled so much that a week later he took Mary and walked out to Mr.
                        Roberts's house. This time <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0094" n="69"/> Mary, to her disgust, was left with
                        Miss Philly's father, while her brother and Miss Philly walked in the
                        frosted garden. Later, when that walk was over, and the little sister
                        trudged along at John Fenn's side in the direction of Perryville, she was
                        very fretful because he would not talk to her. He was oc-cupied, poor boy,
                        in trying again not to "marvel," and to be submissive to the divine will. </p>
                    <p>After that, for several months, he refused Mary's plea to be taken to visit
                        Miss Philly. He had, he told himself, "submitted"; but submission left him
                        very melancholy and solemn, and also a little resentful; indeed, he was so
                        low in his mind, that once he threw out a bitter hint to Dr. Lavendar,
                        &mdash; who, according to his wont, put two and two together. </p>
                    <p>"Men in our profession, sir," said John Fenn, "must not expect personal
                        happiness." <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0095" n="70"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Well," said Dr. Lavendar, meditatively, "perhaps if we don't expect it, the
                        surprise of getting it makes it all the better. I expected it; but I've
                        exceeded my expectations!" </p>
                    <p>"But you are not married," the young man said, impulsively. </p>
                    <p>Dr. Lavendar's face changed; "I hope you will marry, Fenn," he said, quietly.
                        At which John Fenn said, "I am married to my profession; that is enough for
                        any minister." </p>
                    <p>"You'll find your profession a mighty poor housekeeper," said Dr. Lavendar. </p>
                    <p>It was shortly after this that Mr. Fenn and his big roan broke through the
                        snow-drifts and made their way to Henry Roberts's house. "I must speak to
                        you alone, sir," he said to the Irvingite, who, seeing him approaching, had
                        hastened to open the door for him and draw him in out of the cold sunshine. </p>
                    <p>What the caller had to say was brief and to the point: Why was his daughter
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0096" n="71"/> so unkind? John Fenn did not feel now that the world
                        &mdash; which meant Philippa &mdash; hated him. He felt &mdash;
                        he could not help feeling &mdash; that she did not even dislike him; "on
                        the contrary. . . ." So what reason had she for refusing him? But old Mr.
                        Roberts shook his head. "A young female does not have 'reasons,'" he said.
                        But he was sorry for the youth, and he roused himself from his abstraction
                        long enough to question his girl: </p>
                    <p>"He is a worthy young man, my Philippa. Why do you dislike him?" </p>
                    <p>"I do not dislike him." </p>
                    <p>"Then why &mdash;?" her father protested. </p>
                    <p>But Philly was silent. </p>
                    <p>Even Hannah came to the rescue: </p>
                    <p>"You'll get a crooked stick at the end, if you don't look out!" </p>
                    <p>Philly laughed; then her face fell. "I sha'n't have any stick, ever!" </p>
                    <p>And Hannah, in her concern, <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0097" n="72"/> confided her forebodings about the
                        stick to Dr. King. </p>
                    <p>"I wonder," William said to himself, uneasily, "if I was wise to tell that
                        child to hold her tongue? Perhaps they might have straightened it out
                        between 'em before this, if she had told him and been done with it. I've a
                        great mind to ask Dr. Lavendar." </p>
                    <p>He did ask him; at first with proper precautions not to betray a patient's
                        confidence, but, at a word from Dr. Lavendar, tumbling into truthfulness. </p>
                    <p>"You are talking about young Philippa Roberts?" Dr. Lavendar announced,
                        calmly, when William was half-way through his story of concealed identities. </p>
                    <p>"How did you guess it?" the doctor said, astonished; "oh, well, yes, I am. I
                        guess there's no harm telling you &mdash;" </p>
                    <p>"Not the slightest," said Dr. Lavendar, "especially as I knew it already from
                        the young man &mdash; I mean, I knew <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0098" n="73"/> she wouldn't have him.
                        But I didn't know why until your story dovetailed with his. William, the
                        thing has festered in her! The lancet ought to have been used the next day.
                        I believe she'd have been married by this time if she'd spoken out, then and
                        there." </p>
                    <p>William King was much chagrined. "I thought, being a girl, you know, her
                        pride, her self-respect &mdash;" </p>
                    <p>"Oh yes; the lancet hurts," Dr. Lavendar admitted; "but it's better than
                        &mdash; well, I don't know the terms of your trade, Willy &mdash;
                        but I guess you know what I mean?" </p>
                    <p>"I guess I do," said William King, thoughtfully. "Do you suppose it's too
                        late now?" </p>
                    <p>"It will be more of an operation," Dr. Lavendar conceded. </p>
                    <p>"Could <hi rend="italic">I</hi> tell him?" William said, after a while. </p>
                    <p>"I don't see why not," Dr. Lavendar said. <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0099" n="74"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"I suppose I'd have to ask her permission?" </p>
                    <p>"Nonsense!" said Dr. Lavendar. </p>
                    <p>That talk between the physician of the soul and the physician of the body
                        happened on the very night when John Fenn, in his study in Perryville, with
                        Mary dozing on his knee, threw over, once and for all, what he had called
                        "submission" and made up his mind to get his girl! The very next morning he
                        girded himself and walked forth upon the Pike toward Henry Roberts's house.
                        He did not take Mary with him, &mdash; but not because he meant to urge
                        salvation on Miss Philly! As it happened, Dr. King, too, set out upon the
                        Perryville road that morning, remarking to Jinny that if he had had his wits
                        about him that night in November, she would have been saved the trip on this
                        May morning. The trip was easy enough; William had found a medical pamphlet
                        among his mail, and he was reading it, <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0100" n="75"/> with the reins hanging
                        from the crook of his elbow. It was owing to this method of driving that
                        John Fenn reached the Roberts house before Jinny passed it, so she went all
                        the way to Perryville, and then had to turn round to follow on his track. </p>
                    <p>"Brother went to see Miss Philly, and he wouldn't take me," Mary complained
                        to William King, when he drew up at the minister's door; and the doctor was
                        sympathetic to the extent of five cents for candy comfort. </p>
                    <p>But when Jinny reached the Roberts gate Dr. King saw John Fenn down in the
                        garden with Philippa. "Ho &mdash; ho!" said William. "I guess I'll wait
                        and see if he works out his own salvation." He hitched Jinny, and went in to
                        find Philippa's father, and to him he freed his mind. The two men sat on the
                        porch looking down over the tops of the lilac-bushes into the garden, <pb
                           entity="DSSR_000002486_0101" n="76"/> where they could just see the heads of the two young, unhappy
                        people. </p>
                    <p>"It's nonsense, you know," said William King, "that Philly doesn't take that
                        boy. He's head over heels in love with her." </p>
                    <p>"She is not attached to him in any such manner," Henry Roberts said; "I
                        wonder a little at it, myself. He is a good youth." </p>
                    <p>The doctor looked at him wonderingly; it occurred to him that if he had a
                        daughter he would understand her better than Philly's father understood her.
                        "I think the child cares for him," he said; then, hesitatingly, he referred
                        to John Fenn's sickness. "I suppose you know about it?" he said. </p>
                    <p>Philly's father bent his head; he knew, he thought, only too well; no divine
                        revelation in a disordered digestion! </p>
                    <p>"Don't you think," William King said, smiling, "you might try to make <pb
                           entity="DSSR_000002486_0102" n="77"/> her feel that she is wrong not to accept him, now that the
                        charm has worked, so to speak?" </p>
                    <p>"The charm?" the old man repeated, vaguely. </p>
                    <p>"I thought you understood," the doctor said, frowning; then, after a minute's
                        hesitation, he told him the facts. </p>
                    <p>Henry Roberts stared at him, shocked and silent; his girl, his Philippa, to
                        have done such a thing! "So great a sin &mdash; my little Philly!" he
                        said, faintly. He was pale with distress. </p>
                    <p>"My dear sir," Dr. King protested, impatiently, "don't talk about <hi
                            rend="italic">sin</hi> in connection with that child. I wish I'd held my
                        tongue!" </p>
                    <p>Henry Roberts was silent. Philippa's share in John Fenn's mysterious illness
                        removed it still further from that revelation, waited for during all these
                        years with such passionate patience. He paid no attention to William King's
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0103" n="78"/> reassurances; and his silence was so silencing that by and
                        by the doctor stopped talking and looked down into the garden again. He
                        observed that those two heads had not drawn any nearer together. It was not
                        John Fenn's fault. . . . </p>
                    <p>"There can be no good reason," he was saying to Philippa. "If it is a bad
                        reason, I will overcome it! Tell me why?" </p>
                    <p>She put her hand up to her lips and trembled. </p>
                    <p>"Come," he said; "it is my due, Philippa. I <hi rend="italic">will</hi>
                        know!" </p>
                    <p>Philippa shook her head. He took her other hand and stroked it, as one might
                        stroke a child's hand to comfort and encourage it. </p>
                    <p>"You must tell me, beloved," he said. </p>
                    <p>Philippa looked at him with scared eyes; then, suddenly pulling her hands
                        from his and turning away, she covered her face and burst into
                        uncontrollable <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0104" n="79"/> sobbing. He, confounded and frightened, followed
                        her and tried to soothe her. </p>
                    <p>"Never mind, Philly, never mind! if you don't want to tell me &mdash;" </p>
                    <p>"I do want to tell you. I will tell you! You will despise me. But I will tell
                        you. <hi rend="italic">I did a wicked deed</hi>. It was this very plant
                        &mdash; here, where we stand, monk's-hood! It was poison. I didn't know
                        &mdash; oh, I didn't know. The book said monk's-hood &mdash; it was
                        a mistake. But I did a wicked deed. I tried to kill you &mdash;" </p>
                    <p>She swayed as she spoke, and then seemed to sink down and down, until she
                        lay, a forlorn little heap, at his feet. For one dreadful moment he thought
                        she had lost her senses. He tried to lift her, saying, with agitation: </p>
                    <p>"Philly! We will not speak of it &mdash;" </p>
                    <p>"I murdered you," she whispered. "I put the charm into your tea, to make you
                        . . . love me. You didn't die. <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0105" n="80"/> But it was murder. I meant
                        &mdash; I meant no harm &mdash;" </p>
                    <p>He understood. He lifted her up and held her in his arms. Up on the porch
                        William King saw that the two heads were close together! </p>
                    <p>"Why!" the young man said. "Why &mdash; but Philly! You loved me!" </p>
                    <p>"What difference does that make?" she said, heavily. </p>
                    <p>"It makes much difference to me," he answered; he put his hand on her soft
                        hair and tried to press her head down again on his shoulder. But she drew
                        away. </p>
                    <p>"No; no." </p>
                    <p>"But &mdash;" he began. She interrupted him. </p>
                    <p>"Listen," she said; and then, sometimes in a whisper, sometimes breaking into
                        a sob, she told him the story of that November night. He could hardly hear
                        it through. </p>
                    <p>"Love, you loved me! You will marry me." <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0106" n="81"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"No; I am a wicked girl &mdash; a &mdash; a &mdash; an immodest
                        girl &mdash;" </p>
                    <p>"My beloved, you meant no wrong &mdash;" He paused, seeing that she was
                        not listening. </p>
                    <p>Her father and the doctor were coming down the garden path; William King,
                        beaming with satisfaction at the proximity of those two heads, had summoned
                        Henry Roberts to "come along and give 'em your blessing!" </p>
                    <p>But as he reached them, standing now apart, the doctor's smile faded
                        &mdash; evidently something had happened. John Fenn, tense with
                        distress, called to him with frowning command: "Doctor! Tell her, for
                        heaven's sake, tell her that it was nothing &mdash; that charm! Tell her
                        she did no wrong." </p>
                    <p>"No one can do that," Henry Roberts said; "it was a sin." </p>
                    <p>"Now, look here &mdash;" Dr. King began. </p>
                    <p>"It was a sin to try to move by foolish arts the will of God." <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002486_0107" n="82"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>Philippa turned to the young man, standing quivering beside her. "You see?"
                        she said. </p>
                    <p>"No! No, I don't see &mdash; or if I do, never mind." </p>
                    <p>Just for a moment her face cleared. (Yes, truly, he was not thinking of her
                        soul now!) But the gleam faded. "Oh, father, I am a great sinner," she
                        whispered. </p>
                    <p>"No, you're not!" William King said. </p>
                    <p>"Yes, my Philippa, you are," Henry Roberts agreed, solemnly. </p>
                    <p>The lover made a despairing gesture: "Doctor King! tell her 'no!' 'no!'" </p>
                    <p>"Yes," her father went on, "it was a sin. Therefore, Philippa, <hi
                            rend="italic">sin no more</hi>. Did you pray that this young man's love
                        might be given to you?" </p>
                    <p>Philippa said, in a whisper, "Yes." </p>
                    <p>"And it was given to you?" </p>
                    <p>"Yes." </p>
                    <p>"Philippa, was it the foolish weed that moved him to love?" She was <pb
                           entity="DSSR_000002486_0108" n="83"/> silent. "My child, my Philly, it was your Saviour who moved the
                        heart of this youth, because you asked Him. Will you do such despite to your
                        Lord as to reject the gift he has given in answer to your prayer?" Philippa,
                        with parted lips, was listening intently: "The gift He had given!" </p>
                    <p>Dr. King dared not speak. John Fenn looked at him, and then at Philippa, and
                        trembled. Except for the sound of a bird stirring in its nest overhead in
                        the branches, a sunny stillness brooded over the garden. Then, suddenly, the
                        stillness was shattered by a strange sound &mdash; a loud, cadenced
                        chant, full of rhythmical repetitions. The three who heard it thrilled from
                        head to foot; Henry Roberts did not seem to hear it: it came from his own
                        lips. </p>
                    <p>"Oh, Philippa! Oh, Philippa! I do require &mdash; I do require that you
                        accept your Saviour's gift. Add not sin to <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0109" n="84"/> sin. Oh, add not sin
                        to sin by making prayer of no avail! Behold, He has set before thee an open
                        door. Oh, let no man shut it. Oh, let no man shut it. . . ." </p>
                    <p>The last word fell into a low, wailing note. No one spoke. The bird rustled
                        in the leaves above them; a butterfly wavered slowly down to settle on a
                        purple flag in the sunshine. Philly's eyes filled with blessed tears. She
                        stretched out her arms to her father and smiled. But it was John Fenn who
                        caught those slender, trembling arms against his breast; and, looking over
                        at the old man, he said, softly, <hi rend="italic">"The Voice of God</hi>." </p>
                    <p>. . . "and I," said William King, telling the story that night to Dr.
                        Lavendar &mdash; "I just wanted to say 'the voice of <hi rend="italic"
                            >common sense!</hi>'" </p>
                    <p>"My dear William," said the old man, <pb entity="DSSR_000002486_0110" n="85"/> gently, "the most beautiful
                        thing in the world is the knowledge that comes to you, when you get to be as
                        old as I am, that they are the same thing." </p>
