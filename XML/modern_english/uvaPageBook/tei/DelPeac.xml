        <p> ATHALIA HALL stopped to get her breath and look back over the road climbing steeply up
          from the covered bridge. It was a little after five, and the delicate air of dawn was full
          of wood and pasture scents &mdash; the sweetness of bay and the freshness of
          dew-drenched leaves. In the valley night still hung like gauze under the trees, but the
          top of the hill was glittering with sunshine. </p>
        <p>"Why, we've hardly come halfway!" she said. </p>
        <p>Her husband, plodding along behind </p>

        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0023" n="2"/>
        <p> her, nodded ruefully. "Hardly," he said. </p>

        <p>In her slim prettiness Athalia Hall looked like a girl, but she was thirty-four. Part of
          the girlishness lay in the smoothness of her white forehead and in the sincere intensity
          of her gaze. She wore a blue linen dress, and there was a little, soft, blue scarf under
          her chin; her white hat, with pink roses and loops of gray-blue ribbon, shadowed eager,
          unhumorous eyes, the color of forget-me-nots. Her husband was her senior by several years
          &mdash; a large, loose-limbed man, with a scholarly face and mild, calm eyes
          &mdash; eyes that were full of a singular tenacity of purpose. Just now his face
          showed the fatigue of the long climb up-hill; and when his wife, stopping to look back
          over the glistening tops of the birches, said, "I believe it's half a <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002487_0024" n="3"/>
        </p>

        <p> </p>
        <p> mile to the top yet!" he agreed, breathlessly. "Hard work!" he said. </p>

        <p>"It will be worth it when I get to the top and can see the view!" she declared, and began
          to climb again. </p>
        <p>"All the same, this road will be mighty hot when the sun gets full on it," her husband
          said; and added, anxiously, "I wish I had made you rest in the station until train-time."
          She flung out her hands with an exclamation: "Rest! I hate rest!" </p>
        <p>"Hold on, and I'll give you a stick," he called to her; "it's a help when you're
          climbing." He pulled down a slender birch, and, setting his foot on it, broke it off at
          the root. She stopped, with an impatient gesture, and waited while he tore off handfuls of
          leaves and whittled away the side-shoots. </p>
        <p>"Do hurry, Lewis!" she said. <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0025" n="4"/>
        </p>
        <p> </p>

        <p> </p>
        <p>They had left their train at five o'clock in the morning, and had been sitting in the
          frowsy station, sleepily awaiting the express, when Athalia had had this fancy for
          climbing the hill so that she might see the view. </p>
        <p>"It looks pretty steep," her husband warned her. </p>
        <p>"It will be something to do, anyhow!" she said; and added, with a restless sigh, "but you
          don't understand that, I suppose." </p>
        <p>"I guess I do &mdash; after a fashion," he said, smiling at her. It was only in
          love's fashion, for really he was incapable of quite understanding her. To the country
          lawyer of sober piety and granite sense of duty, the rich variety )of her moods was a
          continual wonder and sometimes a painful bewilderment. But whether he understood the
          impetuous inconsequence of her temperament <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0026" n="5"/>
        </p>
        <p> </p>

        <p> "after a fashion," or whether he failed entirely to follow the complexity of her
          thought, he met all her fancies with a sort of tender admiration. People said that Squire
          Hall was henpecked; they also said that he had married beneath him. His father had been a
          judge and his grandfather a minister; he himself was a graduate of a fresh-water college,
          which later, when he published his exegesis on the Prophet Daniel, had conferred its
          little degree upon him and felt that he was a "distinguished son." With such a lineage he
          might have done better, people said, than to marry that girl, who was the most fickle
          creature and no housekeeper, and whose people &mdash; this they told one another in
          reserved voices &mdash; were <hi rend="italic">play-actors!</hi> Athalia's mother, who
          had been the "play-actor," had left her children an example of duty &mdash; <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002487_0027" n="6"/>
        </p>
        <p> </p>

        <p> domestic as well as professional duty &mdash; faithfully done. As she did not leave
          anything else, Athalia added nothing to the Hall fortune; but Lewis's law practice, which
          was hardly more than conveyancing now and then, was helped out by a sawmill which the
          Halls had owned for two generations. So, as things were, they were able to live in humdrum
          prosperity which gave Lewis plenty of time to browse about among his grandfather's old
          theological books, and by-and-by to become a very sound Hebrew scholar, and spared Athalia
          much wholesome occupation which would have been steadying to her eager nature. She was one
          of those people who express every passing emotion, as a flower expresses each wind that
          sways it upon its stalk. But with expression the emotion ended. </p>
        <p>"But she isn't fickle," Lewis had defended <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0028" n="7"/>
        </p>
        <p> </p>

        <p> her once to a privileged relation who had made the accusation, basing it on the fact
          that Athalia had sewed her fingers off for the Missionary Society one winter and done
          nothing the next &mdash; "Athalia <hi rend="italic">isn't</hi> fickle," Lewis
          explained; "fickle people are insincere. Athalia is perfectly sincere, but she is
          temporary; that's all. Anyway, she wants to do something else this winter, and 'Thalia
          must have her head." </p>
        <p>"Your head's better than hers, young man," the venturesome relative insisted. </p>
        <p>"But it must be her head and not mine, Aunty, when it comes to doing what she thinks is
          right, even if it's wrong," he said, smiling. </p>
        <p>"Well, tell her she's a little fool!" cried the old lady, viciously. </p>
        <p>"You can't do that with 'Thalia," <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0029" n="8"/>
        </p>
        <p> </p>

        <p> Lewis explained, patiently, "because it would make her unhappy. She takes everything so
          dreadfully hard; she feels things more than other people do." </p>
        <p>"Lewis," said the little, old, wrinkled, privileged great-aunt, "think a little less of
          her feelings and a little more of your own, or you'll make a mess of things." </p>
        <p>Lewis Hall was too respectful to tell the old lady what he thought of such selfish
          advice; he merely did not act upon it. Instead, he went on giving a great deal of thought
          to Athalia's "feelings." That was why he and she were climbing the hill in the dewy
          silence of this August morning. Athalia had "felt" that she wanted to see the view
          &mdash; though it would have been better for her to have rested in the station, Lewis
          thought; &mdash; ("I ought to <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0030" n="9"/>
        </p>
        <p> </p>

        <p> have coaxed her out of it," he reproached himself.) It certainly was a hard walk,
          considering that it followed a broken night in the sleeping-car. They had left the train
          at five o'clock in the morning, and were sitting in the station awaiting the express when
          Athalia had had this impulse to climb the hill. "It looks pretty steep," Lewis objected;
          and she flung out her hands with an impatient gesture. </p>
        <p>"I love to climb!" she said. So here they were, almost at the top, panting and toiling,
          Athalia's skirts wet with dew, and Lewis's face drawn with fatigue. </p>
        <p>"Look!" she said; "it's all open! We can sit down and see all over the world!" She left
          the road, springing lightly through the fringing bay and briers toward an open space on
          the hillside. "There is a gate in the wall!" <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0031" n="10"/>
        </p>
        <p> </p>

        <p> she called out; "it seems to be some sort of enclosure. Lewis, help me to open the gate!
          Hurry! What a queer place! What do you suppose it is?" </p>
        <p>The gate opened into a little field bounded by a stone wall; the grass had been lately
          mowed, and the stubble, glistening with dew, showed the curving swaths of the scythe;
          across it, in even lines from wall to wall, were rows of small stakes painted black. Here
          and there were faint depressions, low, green cradles in the grass; each depression was
          marked at the head and foot by these iron stakes, hardly higher than the stubble itself. </p>
        <p>"Shakers' graveyard, I guess," Lewis said; "I've heard that they don't use gravestones.
          Peaceful place, isn't it?" </p>
        <p>Her vivid face was instantly grave. "Very peaceful! Oh," she added, as they sat down in
          the shadow of a pine, </p>

        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0032"/>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0033"/>

        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0034" n="11"/>

        <p> "don't you sometimes want to lie down and sleep &mdash; deep down in the grass and
          flowers?" </p>
        <p>"Well," he confessed, "I don't believe it would be as interesting as walking round on top
          of them." </p>
        <p>She looked at him in despair. </p>
        <p>"Come, now," he defended himself, "you don't take much to peace yourself at home." </p>
        <p>"You don't understand!" she said, passionately. </p>
        <p>"There, there, little Tay," he said, smiling, and putting a soothing hand on hers; "I
          guess I do &mdash; after a fashion." </p>
        <p>It was very still; below them the valley had suddenly brimmed with sunshine that
          flickered and twinkled on the birch leaves or shimmered on sombre stretches of pine and
          spruce. Close at hand, pennyroyal grew thick in the shadow of the wall; and just beyond,
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0035" n="12"/>
        </p>
        <p> </p>

        <p> mullen candles cast slender bars of shade across the grass. The sunken graves and the
          lines of iron markers lay before them. </p>
        <p>"How quiet it is!" she said, in a whisper. </p>
        <p>"I guess I'll smoke," Lewis said, and scratched a match on his trousers. </p>
        <p>"How can you!" she protested; "it is profane!" </p>
        <p>He gave her an amused look, but lighted his cigar and smoked dreamily for a minute; then
          he drew a long breath. "I was pretty tired," he said, and turned to glance back at the
          road. A horse and cart were coming in at the open gate; the elderly driver, singing to
          himself, drew up abruptly at the sight of the two under the pine-tree, then drove toward
          them, the wheels of the cart jolting cheerfully over the cradling graves. He had a sickle
          in his </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0036" n="13"/>

        <p> hand, and as he clambered down from the seat, he said, with friendly curiosity: </p>
        <p>"You folks are out early, for the world's people." </p>
        <p>"Is this a graveyard?" Athalia demanded, impetuously. </p>
        <p>"Yee," he said, smiling; "it's our burial-place; we're Shakers." </p>
        <p>"But why are there just the stakes &mdash; without names?" </p>
        <p>"Why should there be names?" he said, whimsically; "they have new names now." </p>
        <p>"Where is your community? Can we go and visit it?" </p>
        <p>"Yee; but we're not much to see," he said; "just men and women, like you. Only we're
          happy. I guess that's all the difference." </p>
        <p>"But what a difference!" she exclaimed; and Lewis smiled. </p>
        <p>"I've come up for pennyroyal," the</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0037" n="14"/>


        <p> Shaker explained, sociably; "it grows thick round here." </p>
        <p>"Tell me about the Shakers," Athalia pleaded. "What do you believe?" </p>
        <p>"Well," he said, a simple shrewdness glimmering in his brown eyes, "if you go to the
          Trustees' House, down there in the valley, Eldress Hannah'll tell you all about us. And
          the sisters have baskets and pretty truck to sell &mdash; things the world's people
          like. Go and ask the Eldress what we believe, and she'll show you the baskets." </p>
        <p>She turned eagerly to her husband. "Never mind the ten-o'clock train, Lewis. Let us go!" </p>
        <p>"We could take a later train, all right," he admitted, "but &mdash;" </p>
        <p>"Oh, <hi rend="italic">please!"</hi> she entreated, joyously. "We'll help you pick
          penny-royal," she added to the Shaker. </p>
        <p>But this he would not allow. "I </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0038" n="15"/>

        <p> doubt you'd be careful enough," he said, mildly; "Sister Lydia was the only female I
          ever knew who could pick herbs." </p>
        <p>"Do you get paid for the work you do?" Athalia asked, practically. Lewis flushed at the
          boldness of such a question, but the old man chuckled. </p>
        <p>"Should I pay myself?" he asked. </p>
        <p>"You own everything in common, don't you?" Lewis said. </p>
        <p>"Yee," said the Shaker; "we're all brothers and sisters. Nobody tries to get ahead of
          anybody else." </p>
        <p>"And you don't believe in marriage?" Athalia asserted. </p>
        <p>"We are as the angels of God," he said, simply. </p>
        <p>He left them and began to sickle his herbs, with the cheerfully obvious purpose of
          escaping further interruption. </p>
        <p>Athalia instantly bubbled over with </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0039" n="16"/>

        <p> questions, but Lewis could tell her hardly more of the Shakers than she knew already. </p>
        <p>"No, it isn't free love," he said; "they're decent enough. They believe in general love,
          not particular, I suppose. . . . 'Thalia, do you think it's worth while to wait over a
          train just to see the settlement?" </p>
        <p>"Of course it is! He said they were happy; I would like to see what kind of life makes
          people happy." </p>
        <p>He looked at the lighted end of his cigar and smiled, but he said nothing. Afterward, as
          they followed the cart across the field and out into the road, Athalia asked the old
          herb-gatherer many questions about the happiness of the community life, which he answered
          patiently enough. Once or twice he tried to draw into their talk the silent husband who
          walked at her side, but </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0040" n="17"/>

        <p> Lewis had nothing to say. Only when some reference was made to one of the Prophecies did
          he look up in sudden interest. "You take that to mean the Judgment, do you?" he said. And
          for the rest of the walk to the settlement the two men discussed the point, the Shaker
          walking with one hand on the heavy shaft, for the support it gave him, and Lewis keeping
          step with him. </p>
        <p>At the foot of the hill the road widened into a grassy street, on both sides of which,
          under the elms and maples, were the community houses, big and substantial, but gauntly
          plain; their yellow paint, flaking and peeling here and there, shone clean and fresh in
          the sparkle of morning. Except for a black cat whose fur glistened like jet, dozing on a
          white doorstep, the settlement, steeped in sunshine, showed no </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0041" n="18"/>

        <p> sign of life. There was a strange remoteness from time about the place; a sort of
          emptiness, and a silence that silenced even Athalia. </p>
        <p>"Where <hi rend="italic">is</hi> everybody?" she said, in a lowered voice; as she spoke,
          a child in a blue apron came from an open doorway and tugged a basket across the street. </p>
        <p>"Are there children here?" Lewis asked, surprised; and their guide said, sadly: </p>
        <p>"Not as many as there ought to be. The new school laws have made a great difference.
          We've only got two. Folks used to send 'em to us to bring up; oftentimes they stayed on
          after they were of age. Sister Lydia came that way. Well, well, she tired of us, Lydy did,
          poor girl! She went back into the world twenty years ago, now. And Sister Jane, she was a
          bound-out child, </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0042" n="19"/>

        <p> too," he rambled on; "she came here when she was six; she's seventy now." </p>
        <p>"What!" Lewis exclaimed; "has she never known anything but &mdash; this?" </p>
        <p>His shocked tone did not disturb the old man. "Want to see my herb-house?" he said.
          "Guess you'll find some of the sisters in the sorting-room. I'm Nathan Dale," he added,
          courteously. </p>
        <p>They had come to the open door of a great, weather-beaten building, from whose open
          windows an aromatic breath wandered out into the summer air. As they crossed the worn
          threshold, Athalia stopped and caught her breath in the overpowering scent of drying
          herbs; then they followed Brother Nathan up a shaky flight of steps to the loft. Here some
          elderly women, sitting on low benches, were sorting over great piles of herbs in </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0043" n="20"/>

        <p> silence &mdash; the silence, apparently, of peace and meditation. Two of them were
          dressed like world's people, but the others wore small gray shoulder-capes buttoned to
          their chins, and little caps of white net stretched smoothly over wire frames; the narrow
          shirrings inside the frames fitted so close to their peaceful, wrinkled foreheads that no
          hair could be seen. </p>
        <p>"I wish I could sit and sort herbs!" Athalia said, under her breath. </p>
        <p>Brother Nathan chuckled. "For how long?" he asked; and then introduced her to the three
          workers, who greeted her calmly and went on sorting their herbs. The loft was dark and
          cool; the window-frames, in which there were no sashes, opened wide on the still August
          fields and woods; the occasional brief words of the sorting-women seemed to drop into a
          pool of </p>

        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0044"/>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0045"/>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0046"/>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0047"/>

        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0048" n="21"/>

        <p> fragrant silence. The two visitors followed Brother Nathan down the room between piles
          of sorted herbs, and out into the sunshine again. Athalia drew a breath of ecstasy. </p>
        <p>"It's all so beautifully tranquil!" she whispered, looking about her with blue, excited
          eyes. </p>
        <p>"Tay and tranquillity!" Lewis said, with an amused laugh. </p>
        <p>But as they went along the grassy street this sense of tranquillity closed about them
          like a palpable peace. Now and then they stopped and spoke to some one &mdash; always
          an elderly person; and in each old face the experiences that life writes in unerasable
          lines about eyes and lips were hidden by a veil of calmness that was curiously unhuman. </p>
        <p>"It isn't canny, exactly," Lewis told his wife, in a low voice. But she did</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0049" n="22"/>

        <p> not seem to hear him. She asked many questions of Eldress Hannah, who had taken them in
          charge, and once or twice she burst into impetuous appreciation of the idea of
          brotherhood, and even of certain theological principles &mdash; which last diverted
          her husband very much. Eldress Hannah showed them the dairy, and the work-room, and all
          there was to see, with a patient hospitality that kept them at an infinite distance. She
          answered Lewis's questions about the community with a sad directness. </p>
        <p>"Yee; there are not many of us now. The world's people say we're dying out. But the Lord
          will preserve the remnant to redeem the world, young man. Yee; when they come in from the
          world they cast their possessions into the whole; we own nothing, for ourselves. Nay; we
          don't have many come. Brother </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0050" n="23"/>

        <p> William was the last. Why did he come?" She looked coldly at Athalia, who had asked the
          question. "Because he saw the way to peace. He'd had strife enough in the world. Yee," she
          admitted, briefly, "some fall from grace, and leave us. The last was Lydia. She was one of
          our children, and I thought she was of the chosen. But she was only thirty when she fell
          away, and you can't expect wisdom at that age. That was nearly twenty years ago. When she
          has tasted the dregs of the world she will come back to us &mdash; if she lives,"
          Eldress Hannah ended. </p>
        <p>Athalia listened breathlessly, her rapt, unhumorous eyes fixed on Eldress Hannah's still
          face. Now and then she asked a question, and once cried out that, after all, why wasn't it
          the way to live? Peace and self-sacrifice</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0051" n="24"/>

        <p> and love! "Oh," she said, turning to her husband, "can't you feel the attraction of it?
          I should think even you could feel it!" </p>
        <p>"I think I feel it &mdash; after a fashion," he said, mildly; "I think I have always
          felt the attraction of community life." </p>
        <p>Afterward, when they had left all this somnolent peace and begun the long walk back to
          the station, he explained what he meant: "I couldn't say so before the Eldress, but of
          course there are times when anybody can feel the charm of getting rid of personal
          responsibility &mdash; and that is what community life really means. It's the relief
          of being a little cog in a big machine; in fact, the very attraction of it is a sort of
          temptation, to my way of looking at it. But it &mdash; well, it made me sleepy," he
          confessed. </p>
        <p>For once his wife had no reply. She </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0052" n="25"/>

        <p> was very quiet on that return journey in the cars, and in the days that followed she
          kept referring to their visit with a persistence that surprised her husband. She thought
          the net caps were beautiful; she thought the exquisite cleanness of everything was like a
          perfume &mdash; "the perfume of a wild rose!" she said, ecstatically. She thought the
          having everything in common was the way to live. "And just think how peaceful it is!" </p>
        <p>"Well, yes," Lewis said; "I suppose it's peaceful &mdash; after a fashion. Anything
          that isn't alive is peaceful." </p>
        <p>"But their idea of brotherhood is the highest kind of life!" </p>
        <p>"The only fault I have to find with it is that it isn't human," he said, mildly. He had
          no desire to prove or disprove anything; Athalia was looking better, just because she was
          interested</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0053" n="26"/>

        <p> in something, and that was enough for Lewis. When she proposed to read a book on
          Shakerism aloud, he fell into her mood with what was, for him, enthusiasm; he declared he
          would like nothing better, and he put his daily paper aside without a visible regret. </p>
        <p>"Well," he admitted, "I must say there's more to it than I supposed. They've studied the
          Prophecies; that's evident. And they're not narrow in their belief. They're really
          Unitarians." </p>
        <p>"Narrow?" she said &mdash; "they are as wide as heaven itself! And, oh, the peace of
          it!" </p>
        <p>"But they are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> human," he would insist, smiling; "no marriage
          &mdash; that's not human, little Tay." </p>
        <p>It was not until two months later that he began to feel vaguely uneasy. </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0054" n="27"/>

        <p> "Yes; it's interesting," he admitted; "but nobody in these days would want to be a
          Shaker." To which she replied, boldly, "Why not?" </p>
        <p>That was all, but it was enough. Lewis Hall's face suddenly sobered. He had not stumbled
          along behind her in all her emotional experiences without learning to read the guide-posts
          to her thought. "I hope she'll get through with it soon," he said to himself, with a
          worried frown; "it isn't wholesome for a mind like 'Thalia's to dwell on this kind of
          thing." </p>
        <p>It was in November that she broke to him that she had written Eldress Hannah to ask if
          she might come and visit the community, and had been answered "Yee." </p>
        <p>Lewis was silent with consternation; he went out to the sawmill and climbed up into the
          loft to think it all out</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0055" n="28"/>

        <p> alone. Should he forbid it? He knew that was nonsense; in the first place, his
          conception of the relation of husband and wife did not include that kind of thing; but
          more than that, opposition would, he said to himself, "push her in." Not into Shakerism;
          "'Thalia couldn't be a Shaker to save her life," he thought, with an involuntary smile;
          but into an excited discontent with her comfortable, prosaic life. No; definite opposition
          to the visit must not be thought of &mdash; but he must try and persuade her not to
          go. How? What plea could he offer? His own loneliness without her he could not bring
          himself to speak of; he shrank from taking what seemed to him an advantage. He might urge
          that she would find it cold and uncomfortable in those old frame houses high up on the
          hills; or that it would be bad for her health </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0056" n="29"/>

        <p> to take the rather wearing journey at this time of year. But he knew too well how little
          effect any such prudent counsels would have. The very fact that her interest had lasted
          for more than three months showed that it had really struck roots into her mind, and mere
          prudence would not avail much. Still, he would urge prudence; then, if she was determined,
          she must go. "She'll get sick of it in a fortnight," he said; but for the present he must
          let her have her head, even if she was making a mistake. She had a right to have her head,
          he reminded himself &mdash; "but I must tell those people to keep her warm, she takes
          cold so easily." </p>
        <p>He got up and looked out of the window; below, in the race, there was a jam of logs, and
          the air was keen with the pungent smell of sawdust and new boards. The whir and thud of
          the</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0057" n="30"/>

        <p> machinery down-stairs sent a faint quiver through the planks under his feet. "The mill
          will net a good profit this year," he said to himself, absently. "'Thalia can have pretty
          nearly anything she wants." And even as he said it he had a sudden, vague misgiving: if
          she didn't have everything she wanted, perhaps she would be happier? But the idea was too
          new and too subtle to follow up, so the result of that troubled hour in the mill-chamber
          was only that he made no very resolute objection to Athalia's acceptance of Eldress
          Hannah's permission to come. It had been given grudgingly enough. </p>
        <p>The family were gathered in the sitting-room; they had had their supper &mdash; the
          eight elderly women and the three elderly men, all that were left of</p>

        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0058"/>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0059"/>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0060" n="31"/>

        <p> the community. The room had the austere and shining cleanness which Athalia had called a
          perfume, but it was full of homely comfort. A blue-and-white rag carpet in the centre left
          a border of bare floor, painted pumpkin-yellow; there was a glittering air-tight stove
          with isinglass windows that shone like square, red eyes; a gay patchwork cushion in the
          seat of a rocking-chair was given up to the black cat, whose sleek fur glistened in the
          lamplight. Three of the sisters knitted si-lently; two others rocked back and forth, their
          tired, idle hands in their laps, their eyes closed; the other three yawned, and spoke
          occasionally between themselves of their various tasks. Brother Nathan read his weekly <hi
            rend="italic">Farmer;</hi> Brother William turned over the leaves of a hymn-book and
          appeared to count them with noiseless,</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0061" n="32"/>

        <p> moving lips; Brother George cut pictures out of the back of a magazine, yawning
          sometimes, and looking often at his watch. Into this quietness Eldress Hannah's still
          voice came: </p>
        <p>"I have heard from Lydia again." There was a faint stir, but no one spoke. "The Lord is
          dealing with her," Eldress Hannah said; "she is in great misery." </p>
        <p>Brother George nodded. "That is good; He works in a mysterious way &mdash; she's real
          miserable, is she? Well, well; that's good. The mercies of the Lord are everlasting," he
          ended, in a satisfied voice, and began to read again. </p>
        <p>"Amen! &mdash; amen!" said Brother William, vaguely. </p>
        <p>"Poor Lydy!" Brother Nathan murmured. </p>
        <p>"And I had another letter," the Eldress proceeded, "from that young</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0062" n="33"/>

        <p> woman who came here in August &mdash; Athalia Hall; do you remember? &mdash; she
          asked two questions to the minute! She wants to visit us." </p>

        <p>Brother Nathan looked at her over his spectacles, and one of the sisters opened her eyes. </p>
        <p>"I don't see why she should," Eldress Hannah added. </p>
        <p>Two of the old brothers nodded agreement. </p>
        <p>"The curiosity of the world's people does not help their souls," said one of the
          knitters. </p>
        <p>"She thinks we walk in the Way to Peace," said the Eldress. </p>
        <p>"Yee; we do," said Brother George. </p>
        <p>"Shall I tell her 'nay'?" the Eldress questioned, calmly. </p>
        <p>"Yee," said Brother George; and the dozing sisters murmured "Yee." </p>
        <p>"Wait," said Brother Nathan; "her</p>

        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0063" n="34"/>

        <p> husband &mdash; <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has something to him. Let her come." </p>

        <p>"But if she visited us, how would that affect him?" Eldress Hannah asked, surprised into
          faint animation. </p>
        <p>"If she was moved to stay it would affect him," Brother Nathan said, dryly; "he would
          come, too, and there are very few of us left, Eldress. He would be a great gain." </p>
        <p>There was a long silence. Brother William's gray head sagged on his shoulder, and the
          hymn-book slipped from his gnarled old hands. The knitting sisters began, one after
          another, to stab their needles into their balls of gray yarn and roll their work up in
          their aprons. </p>
        <p>"It's getting late, Eldress," one of them said, and glanced at the clock. </p>
        <p>"Then I'll tell her she may come?" said Eldress Hannah, reluctantly. </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0064" n="35"/>

        <p>"He can make the wrath of man to praise Him," Brother Nathan encouraged her. </p>
        <p>"Yee; but I never heard that He could make the foolishness of woman do it," the old woman
          said, grimly. </p>
        <p>As the brothers and sisters parted at the door of the sitting-room Brother Nathan plucked
          at the Eldress's sleeve; "Is she very wretched &mdash; Lydia? Where is she now,
          Eldress? Poor Lydy! poor little Lydy!" </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The fortnight of Athalia's absence wore greatly upon her husband. Apprehension lurked in
          the back of his mind. In the mill, or out on the farm, or when he sat down among his
          shabby, old, calf-skin books, he was assailed by the memory of all her various fancies
          during their married life. Some of </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0065" n="36"/>

        <p> them were no more remarkable or unexpected than this interest in Shakerism. He began to
          be slowly frightened. Suppose she should take it into her head &mdash;?</p>

        <p>When her fortnight was nearly up and he was already deciding whether, when he drove over
          to Depot Corners to meet her, he would take Ginny's colt or the new mare, a letter came to
          say she was going to stay a week longer. </p>
        <p>"I believe," she wrote &mdash; her very pen, in the frantic down-hill slope of her
          lines, betraying the excitement of her thoughts &mdash; "I believe that for the first
          time in my life I have found my God!" The letter was full of dashes and underlining, and
          on the last page there was a blistered splash into which the ink had run a little on the
          edges. </p>
        <p>Lewis Hall's heart contracted with an almost physical pang. "I must go </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0066" n="37"/>

        <p> and get her right off," he said; "this thing is serious!" And yet, after a wakeful
          night, he decided, with the extraordinary respect for her individuality so characteristic
          of the man &mdash; a respect that may be called foolish or divine, as you happen to
          look at it &mdash; he decided not to go. If he dragged her away from the Shakers
          against her will, what would be gained? "I must give her her head, and let her see for
          herself that it's all moonshine," he told himself, painfully, over and over; "my seeing it
          won't accomplish anything." But he counted the hours until she would come home. </p>

        <p>When she came, as soon as he saw her walking along the platform looking for him while he
          stood with his hand on Ginny's colt's bridle, even before she had spoken a single word,
          even then he knew what had happened &mdash; the </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0067" n="38"/>

        <p> uplifted radiance of her face announced it. </p>

        <p>But she did not tell him at once. On the drive home, in the dark December afternoon, he
          was tense with apprehension; once or twice he ventured some questions about the Shakers,
          but she put them aside with a curious gentleness, her voice a little distant and
          monotonous; her words seemed to come only from the surface of her mind. When he lifted her
          out of the sleigh at their own door he felt a subtle resistance in her whole body; and
          when, in the hall, he put his arms about her and tried to kiss her, she drew back sharply
          and said: </p>
        <p>"No! &mdash; <hi rend="italic">please!"</hi> Then, as they stood there in the chilly
          entry, she burst into a passionate explanation: she had been convicted and converted! She
          had found her Saviour! She &mdash; </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0068" n="39"/>

        <p>"There, there, little Tay," he broke in, sadly; "supper is ready, dear." He heard a
          smothered exclamation &mdash; that it was smothered showed how completely she was
          immersed in a new experience, one of the details of which was the practice of
          self-control. </p>
        <p>But, of course, that night they had it out. . . . When they came into the sitting-room
          after supper she flung the news into his pale face: <hi rend="italic">she wished to join
            the Shakers</hi>. But she must have his consent, she added, impatiently, because
          otherwise the Shakers would not let her come. </p>
        <p>"That's the only thing I don't agree with them about," she said, candidly; "I don't think
          they ought to make anything so solemn contingent upon the 'consent' of any other human
          being. But, of course, Lewis, it's only a form. I have left you in spirit, and that is</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0069" n="40"/>

        <p> what counts. So I told them I knew you would consent." </p>

        <p>She looked at him with those blue, ecstatic eyes, so oblivious to his pain that for a
          moment a sort of impersonal amazement at such self-centredness held him silent. But after
          the first shock he spoke with a slow fluency that pierced Athalia's egotism and stirred an
          answering astonishment in her. His weeks of vague misgiving, deepening into keen
          apprehension, had given him protests and arguments which, although they never convinced
          her, silenced her temporarily. She had never known her husband in this character. Of
          course, she had been prepared for objections and entreaties, but sound arguments and stern
          disapproval confused and annoyed her. She had supposed he would tell her she would break
          his heart; instead, he </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0070" n="41"/>

        <p> said, calmly, that she hadn't the head for Shakerism. </p>
        <p>"You've got to be very reasonable, 'Thalia, to stand a community life, or else you've got
          to be an awful fool. You are neither one nor the other." </p>
        <p>"I believe their doctrines," she declared, "and I would die for a religious belief. But I
          don't suppose you ever felt that you could die for a thing!" </p>
        <p>"I think I have &mdash; after a fashion," he said, mildly; "but dying for a thing is
          easy; it's living for it that's hard. You couldn't keep it up, Athalia; you couldn't live
          for it." </p>
        <p>Well, of course, that night was only the beginning. The days and weeks that followed were
          full of argument, of entreaty, of determination. Perhaps if he had laughed at her. . . .
          But it is dangerous to laugh at unhumorous people, for if they get angry all is lost. </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0071" n="42"/>

        <p> So he never laughed, nor in all their talks did he ever reproach her for not loving him.
          Once only his plea was personal &mdash; and even then it was only indirectly so. </p>
        <p>"Athalia," he said, "there's only one kind of pain in this world that never gets cured.
          It's the pain that comes when you remember that you've made somebody who loved you unhappy
          &mdash; not for a principle, but for your own pleasure. I know that pain, and I know
          how it lasts. Once I did something, just to please myself, that hurt mother's feelings.
          I'd give my right hand if I hadn't done it. It's twenty-two years ago, and I wasn't more
          than a boy, and she forgave me and forgot all about it. I have never forgotten it. I wish
          to God I could! 'Thalia, I don't want you to suffer that kind of pain."</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0072" n="43"/>

        <p>She saw the implication rather than the warning, and she burst out, angrily, that she
          wasn't doing this for "pleasure"; she was doing it for principle! It was for the salvation
          of her soul! </p>
        <p>"Athalia," he said, solemnly, "the salvation of our souls depends on doing our duty." </p>
        <p>"Ah!" she broke in, triumphantly, "out of your own lips: &mdash; isn't it my duty to
          do what seems to me right?" </p>
        <p>He considered a minute. "Well, yes; I suppose the most valuable example any one can set
          is to do what he or she believes to be right. It may be wrong, but that is not the point.
          We must do what we conceive to be our duty. Only, we've got to be sure, Tay, in deciding
          upon duty, in deciding what is right, &mdash; we've got to be sure that self-interest
          is eliminated. I don't believe </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0073" n="44"/>

        <p> anybody can decide absolutely on what is right without eliminating self." </p>

        <p>She frowned at this impatiently; its perfect fairness meant nothing to her. </p>
        <p>"You promised to be my wife," he went on with a curious sternness; "it is obviously
          'right,' and so it is your first duty to keep your promise &mdash; at least, so long
          as my conduct does not absolve you from it." Then he added, hastily, with careful justice:
          "Of course, I'm not talking about promises to love; they are nonsense. Nobody can promise
          to love. Promises to do our duty are all that count." </p>
        <p>That was the only reproach he made &mdash; if it was a reproach &mdash; for his
          betrayed love. It was just as well. Discussion on this subject between husbands and wives
          is always futile. Nothing was ever accomplished by it; and yet, in</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0074" n="45"/>

        <p> spite of the verdict of time and experience that nothing is gained, over and over the
          jealous man, and still more frequently the jealous woman, protests against a lost love
          with a bitterness that kills pity and turns remorse into antagonism. But Lewis Hall made
          no reproaches. Perhaps Athalia missed them; perhaps, under her spiritual passion, she was
          piqued that earthly passion was so readily silenced. But, if she was, she did not know it.
          She was entirely sincere and intensely happy in a new experience. It was a long winter of
          argument; &mdash; and then suddenly, in early April, the break came. . . . </p>

        <p>"I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> go; I have a right to save my soul!" </p>
        <p>And he said, very simply, "Well, Athalia, then I'll go, too." </p>
        <p>"You? But you don't believe &mdash;" </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0075" n="46"/>

        <p> And almost in the Bible words he answered her, "No; but where you go, I will go; where
          you live, I will live." And then, a moment later, "I promised to cleave to you, little
          Tay." </p>

        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0076" n="47"/>

        <p> THE uprooting of their life took a surprisingly short time. In all those dark months of
          argument Lewis Hall had been quietly making plans for this final step, and such
          preparation betrayed his knowledge from the first of the hopelessness of his struggle
          &mdash; indeed, the struggle had only been loyalty to a lost cause. His calm assent to
          his wife's ultimatum left her a little blank; but in the immediate excitement of removal,
          in the thrill of martyrdom that came with publicity, the blankness did not last. What the
          publicity was to her husband she could not understand. He received the protests of his
          family</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0077" n="48"/>

        <p> in stolid silence; when the venturesome great-aunt told him what she thought of him, he
          smiled; when his brother informed him that he was a fool, he said he shouldn't wonder.
          When the minister, egged on by distracted Hall relatives, remonstrated, he replied,
          respectfully, that he was doing what he believed to be his duty, "and if it seems to be a
          duty, I can't help myself; you see that, don't you?" he said, anxiously. But that was
          practically all he found to say; for the most part he was silent. Athalia, in her
          absorption, probably had not the slightest idea of the agonies of mortification which he
          suffered; her imagination told her, truly enough, what angry relatives and pleasantly
          horrified neighbors said about her, and the abuse exhilarated her very much; but her
          imagination stopped there. It did not give her the</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0078" n="49"/>

        <p> family's opinion of her husband; it did not whisper the gossip of the grocery-store and
          the post-office; it did not repeat the chuckles or echo the innuendoes: </p>

        <p>"So Squire Hall's wife's got tired of him? Rather live with the Shakers than him!" "I
          like Hall, but I haven't any sympathy with him," the doctor said; "what in thunder did he
          let her go gallivanting off to visit the Shakers for? Might have known a female like Mrs.
          Hall'd get a bee in her bonnet. He ought to have kept her at home. <hi rend="italic"
          >I</hi> would have. I wouldn't have had any such nonsense in my family! Well, for an
          obstinate man (and he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> obstinate, you know), the squire, when it
          comes to his wife, has no more backbone than a wet string." </p>
        <p>"Wonder if there's anything under</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0079" n="50"/>

        <p> it all?" came the sly insinuation of gossip; "wonder if she hasn't got something besides
          the Shakers up her sleeve? You wait!" </p>


        <p>If Athalia's imagination spared her these comments, Lewis's unimaginative common sense
          supplied them. He knew what other men and husbands were saying about him; what servants
          and gossip and friends insinuated to one another, and set his jaw in silence. He made no
          excuse and no explanation. Why should he? The facts spoke. His wife did prefer the Shakers
          to her husband and her home. To have interfered with her purpose by any plea of his
          personal unhappiness, or by any threat of an appeal to law, or even by refusing to give
          the "consent" essential to her admission, would not have altered these facts. As for his
          reasons for going with her, they would not have</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0080" n="51"/>

        <p> enhanced his dignity in the eyes of the men who wouldn't have had any such nonsense in
          their families: he must be near her to see that she did not suffer too much hardship, and
          to bring her home when she was ready to come. </p>

        <p>In those days of tearing his life up by the roots the silent man was just a little more
          silent, that was all. But the fact was burning into his consciousness: he couldn't keep
          his wife! That was what they said, and that was the truth. It seemed to him as if his soul
          blushed at his helplessness. But his face was perfectly stolid. He told Athalia,
          passively, that he had rented the house and mill to Henry Davis; that he had settled half
          his capital upon her, so that she would have some money to put into the common treasury of
          the community; then he added </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0081" n="52"/>

        <p> that he had taken a house for himself near the settlement, and that he would hire out to
          the Shakers when they were haying, or do any farm-work that he could get. </p>

        <p>"I can take care of myself, I guess," he said; "I used to camp out when I was a boy, and
          I can cook pretty well, mother always said." He looked at her wistfully; but the
          uncomfortableness of such an arrangement did not strike her. In her desire for a new
          emotion, her eagerness to <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> &mdash; that eagerness which is
          really a sensuality of the mind &mdash; she was too absorbed in her own self-chosen
          hardships to think of his; which were not entirely self-chosen. </p>
        <p>"I think I can find enough to do," he said; "the Shakers need an able-bodied man; they
          only have those three old men." </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0082" n="53"/>

        <p>"How do you know that?" she asked, quickly. </p>
        <p>"I've been to see them twice this winter," he said. </p>
        <p>"Why!" she said, amazed, "you never told me!" </p>
        <p>"I don't tell you everything nowadays, 'Thalia," he said, briefly. </p>
        <p>In those two visits to the Shakers, Lewis Hall had been treated with great delicacy;
          there had been no effort to proselytize, and equally there had been no triumphing over the
          accession of his wife; in fact, Athalia was hardly referred to, except when they told him
          that they would take good care of her, and when Brother Nathan volunteered a brief summary
          of Shaker doctrines &mdash; "so as you can feel easy about her," he explained: "We
          believe that Christ was the male principle in Deity, and Mother Ann was the female
          principle. </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0083" n="54"/>

        <p> And we believe in confession of our sins, and communion with the dead &mdash;
          spiritualism, they call it nowadays &mdash; and in the virgin life. Shakers don't
          marry, nor give in marriage. And we have all things in common. That's all, friend. You
          see, we don't teach anything that Christ didn't teach, so she won't learn any evil from
          us. Simple, ain't it.?" </p>
        <p>"Well, yes, after a fashion," Lewis Hall said; "but it isn't human." </p>
        <p>And Brother Nathan smiled mystically. "Maybe that isn't against it, in the long run," he
          said. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>They came to the community in the spring twilight. The brothers and sisters had assembled
          to meet the convert, and to give a neighborly hand to the silent man who was to live by
          himself in a little, gray, shingled house </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0084" n="55"/>

        <p> down on Lonely Lake Road. It was a supreme moment to Athalia. She had expected an
          intense parting from her husband when they left their own house; and she was ready to
          press into her soul the poignant thorn of grief, not only because it would make her <hi
            rend="italic">feel</hi>, but because it would emphasize in her own mind the divine
          self-sacrifice which she wanted to believe she was making. But when the moment came to
          close the door of the old home behind them, her husband was cruelly commonplace about it
          &mdash; for poor Lewis had no more drama in him than a kindly Newfoundland dog! He was
          full of practical cares for his tenant, and he stopped even while he was turning the key
          in the lock, to "fuss," as Athalia said, over some last details of the transfer of the
          sawmill. Athalia could not tear herself from arms that placidly</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0085" n="56"/>

        <p> consented to her withdrawal; so there had been no rending ecstasies. In consequence, on
          the journey up to the community she was a little morose, a little irritable even, just as
          the drunkard is apt to be irritable when sobriety is unescapable. . . . But at the door of
          the Family House she had her opportunity: she said, dramatically, "Goodnight &mdash;
            <hi rend="italic">Brother Lewis</hi>." It was an entirely sincere moment. Dramatic
          nat-ures are not often insincere, they are only unreal. </p>

        <p>As for her husband, he said, calmly, "Good-night, dear," and trudged off in the cool May
          dusk down Lonely Lake Road. He found the door of the house on the latch, and a little fire
          glowing in the stove; Brother Nathan had seen to that, and had left some food on the table
          for him. But in spite of the old man's friendly foresight the house</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0086" n="57"/>

        <p> had all the desolation of confusion; in the kitchen there were two or three cases of
          books, broken open but not unpacked, a trunk and a carpet-bag, and some bundles of
          groceries; they had been left by the expressman on tables and chairs and on the floor, so
          that the solitary man had to do some lifting and unpacking before he could sit down in his
          loneliness to eat the supper Brother Nathan had provided. He looked about to see where he
          would put up shelves for his books, and as he did so the remembrance of his quiet, shabby
          old study came to him, almost like a blow. </p>


        <p>"Well," he said to himself, "this won't be for so very long. We'll be back again in a
          year, I guess. Poor little Tay! I shouldn't wonder if it was six months. I wonder, can I
          buy </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0087" n="58"/>

        <p> Henry Davis off, if she wants to go back in six months?" </p>

        <p>And yet, in spite of his calm understanding of the situation, the wound burned. As he
          went about putting things into some semblance of order, he paused once and looked hard
          into the fire. . . . When she did want to go back &mdash; let it be in six months or
          six weeks or six days &mdash; would things be the same? Something had been done to the
          very structure and fabric of their life. "Can it ever be the same?" he said to himself;
          and then he passed his hand over his eyes, in a bewildered way &mdash; "Will I be the
          same?" he said. </p>

      </div1>

      <div1 type="chapter" n="3" id="d12">
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0088" n="59"/>

        <p> SUMMER at the Shaker settlement, lying in the green cup of the hills, was very
          beautiful. The yellow houses along the grassy street drowsed in the sunshine, and when the
          wind stirred the maple leaves one could see the distant sparkle of the lake. Athalia had a
          fancy, in the warm twilights, for walking down Lonely Lake Road, that jolted over logs and
          across gullies and stopped abruptly at the water's edge. She had to pass Lewis's house on
          the way, and if he saw her he would call out to her, cheerfully, </p>
        <p>"Hullo, 'Thalia! how are you, dear?" </p>
        <p>And she, with prim intensity, would</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0089" n="60"/>

        <p> reply, "Good-evening, <hi rend="italic">Brother</hi> Lewis." </p>

        <p>If one of the sisters was with her, they would stop and speak to him; otherwise she
          passed him by in such an eager consciousness of her part that he smiled &mdash; and
          then sighed. When she had a companion, Lewis and the other Shakeress would gossip about
          the weather or the haying, and Lewis would have the chance to say: "You're not
          overworking, 'Thalia? You're not tired?" While Athalia, in her net cap and her gray
          shoulder cape buttoned close up to her chin, would dismiss the anxious affection with a
          peremptory "Of course not! I have bread to eat you know not of, Brother Lewis." Then she
          would add, didactically, some word of dogma or admonition. </p>
        <p>But she had not much time to give to Brother Lewis's salvation &mdash; she was</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0090" n="61"/>

        <p> so busy in adjusting herself to her new life. Its picturesque details fascinated her
          &mdash; the cap, the brevity of speech, the small mannerisms, the occasional and very
          reserved mysticism, absorbed her so that she thought very little of her husband. She saw
          him occasionally on those walks down to the lake, or when, after a day in the fields with
          the three old Shaker men, Brother Nathan brought him home to supper. </p>

        <p>"We Shakers are given to hospitality," he said; "we're always looking for the angel we
          are going to entertain unawares. Come along home with us, Lewis." And Lewis would plod up
          the hill and take his turn at the tin wash-basin, and then file down the men's side of the
          stairs to the dining-room, where he and the three old brothers sat at one table, and
          Athalia and the eight sisters sat at the other table. After supper</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0091" n="62"/>

        <p> he had the chance to see Athalia and to make sure that she was not looking tired. "You
          didn't take cold yesterday, 'Thalia? I saw you were out in the rain," he would say. And
          she, always a little embarrassed at such personal interest, would reply, primly, "I am not
          at all tired, Brother Lewis." Nathan used to walk home with his guest, and sometimes they
          talked of work that must be done, and sometimes touched on more unpractical things
          &mdash; those spiritual manifestations which at rare intervals centred in Brother
          William and were the hope of the whole community. For who could tell when the old man's
          incoherent muttering would break into the clear speech of one of those Heavenly Visitants
          who, in the early days, had descended upon the Shakers, and then, for some divine and
          deeply mysterious reason, withdrawn </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0092" n="63"/>

        <p> from such pure channels of communication, and manifested themselves in the world,
          &mdash; but through base and sordid natures. Poor, vague Brother William, who saw
          visions and dreamed dreams, was, in this community, the torch that held a smouldering
          spark of the divine fire, and when, in a cataleptic state, his faint intelligence
          fluttered back into some dim depths of personality, and he moaned and muttered, using
          awful names with babbling freedom, Brother Nathan and the rest listened with pathetic
          eagerness for a <hi rend="italic">"thus saith the Lord,"</hi> which should enflame the
          gray embers of Shakerism and give light to the whole world! When Nathan talked of these
          things he would add, with a sigh, that he hoped some day William would be inspired to tell
          them something more of Sister Lydia: "Once William said, </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0093" n="64"/>

        <p> 'Coming, coming.' <hi rend="italic">I</hi> think it meant Lydia; but Eldress thought it
          was Athalia; it was just before she came." Brother Nathan sighed. "I wish it had meant
          Lydy," he said, simply. </p>

        <p>If Lewis wished it had meant Lydy, he did not say so. And, indeed, he said very little
          upon any subject; Brother Nathan did most of the talking. </p>
        <p>"I fled from the City of Destruction when I was thirty," he told Lewis; "that was just a
          year before Sister Lydy left us. Poor Lydy! poor Lydy!" he said. "Oh, yee, <hi
            rend="italic">I</hi> know the world. I know it, my boy! Do you?" </p>
        <p>"Why, after a fashion," Lewis said; and then he asked, suddenly, "Why did you turn
          Shaker, Nathan?" </p>
        <p>"Well, I got hold of a Shaker book that set me thinking. Sister Lydia gave it to me. I
          met Sister Lydia</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0094" n="65"/>

        <p> when she had come down to the place I lived to sell baskets. And she was interested in
          my salvation, and gave me the book. Then I got to figuring out the Prophecies, and I saw
          Shakerism fulfilled them; and then I began to see that when you don't own anything
          yourself you can't worry about your property; well, that clinched me, I guess. Poor Sister
          Lydia, she didn't abide in grace herself," he ended, sadly. </p>

        <p>"I should have thought you would have been sorry then, that you &mdash;" Lewis began,
          but checked himself. "How about" &mdash; he said, and stopped to clear his voice,
          which broke huskily; &mdash; "how about love between man and woman? Husband and wife?" </p>
        <p>"Marriage is honorable," Brother Nathan conceded; "Shakers don't despise marriage. But
          they like to</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0095" n="66"/>

        <p> see folks grow out of it into something better, like &mdash; like your wife, maybe." </p>

        <p>"Well, your doctrine would put an end to the world," Lewis said, smiling. </p>
        <p>"I guess," said Brother Nathan, dryly, "there ain't any immediate danger of the world
          coming to an end." </p>
        <p>"I'd like to see that book," Lewis said, when they parted at the pasture-bars where a
          foot-path led down the hill to his own house. </p>
        <p>And that night Brother Nathan had an eager word for the family. "He's asked for a book!"
          he said. The Eldress smiled doubtfully, but Athalia, with a rapturous upward look, said, </p>
        <p>"May the Lord guide him!" then added, practically, "It won't amount to anything. He
          thinks Shakerism isn't human." </p>
        <p>"That's not against it, that's not,</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0096" n="67"/>

        <p> against it!" Nathan declared, smiling; "I've told him so a dozen times!" </p>

        <p>But Athalia was so happy that first year, and so important, that she did not often
          concern herself with the welfare of the man who had been her husband. Instead &mdash;
          it was early in April &mdash; he concerned himself with hers; he tried, tentatively,
          to see if it wasn't almost time for Athalia "to get through with it." Of course,
          afterward, Sister Athalia realized, with chagrin, that this attempt was only a forerunner
          of the fever that was developing, which in a few days was to make him a very sick man. But
          for the moment his question seemed to her a temptation of the devil, and, of course,
          resisted temptation made her faith stronger than ever. </p>
        <p>It was a deliciously cold spring night; Lewis had drawn the table, with his</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0097" n="68"/>

        <p> books on it, close to the fire to try to keep warm, but he shivered, even while his
          shoulders scorched, and somehow he could not keep his mind on the black, rectangular
          characters of the Hebrew page before him. He had been interested in Brother Nathan's
          explanation of Hosea's forecasting of Shakerism, and he had admitted to himself that, if
          Nathan was correct, there would be something to be said for Shakerism. The idea made him
          vaguely uneasy, because, that "something" might be so conclusive, that &mdash; But he
          could not face such a possibility. </p>

        <p>He wanted to dig at the text, so that he might refute Nathan; but somehow that night he
          was too dull to refute anybody, and by-and-by he pushed the black-lettered page aside,
          and, crouching over the fire, held out his hands to the blaze. He thought, </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0098"/>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0099"/>

        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0100" n="69"/>

        <p> vaguely, of the big fireplace in the old study, and suddenly, in the chilly numbness of
          his mind, he saw it &mdash; with such distinctness that he was startled. Then, a
          moment later, it changed into the south chamber that had been his mother's bedroom
          &mdash; he could even detect the faint scent of rose-geranium that always hung about
          her; he noticed that the green shutters on the west windows were bowed, and from between
          them a line of sunshine fell across the matting on the floor and touched the four-poster
          that had a chintz spread and valance. How well he knew the faded roses and the cockatoos
          on that old chintz! Over there by the window he had caught her crying that time he had
          hurt her feelings, "just for his own pleasure"; the old stab of this thought pierced
          through the feverish mists and touched the quick. He struggled</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0101" n="70"/>

        <p> numbly with the visualization of fever, brushing his hot hand across his eyes and trying
          to see which was real &mdash; the geranium-sweet south chamber or the chilly house on
          Lonely Lake Road. Athalia had given him pain in that same way &mdash; just for her own
          pleasure. Poor little Tay! He was afraid it would hurt her, some day, when she realized
          it; well, when she came to herself, when she got through her playing at Shakerism, he must
          not let her know how great the pain had been; she would suffer too much if she should
          understand his misery: and Athalia didn't bear suffering well. . . . But how long she had
          been getting over Shakerism! He had thought it would only last six months, and here it was
          a year! Well, if Nathan's reading of the Prophecies was right, then Athalia would never
          get over it. She ought</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0102" n="71"/>

        <p> never to get over it. Then what would become of the farm and the sawmill? And instantly
          everything was unreal again; he could hear the hum of the driving-wheel and the screech of
          the saw tearing through a log; how fragrant the fresh planks were, and the great heaps of
          sawdust &mdash; but the noise made his head ache; and &mdash; and the fire didn't
          seem hot. . . . </p>

        <p>It was in one of those moments when the mists thinned, and he knew that he was shivering
          over the stove instead of basking in the sunshine in his mother's room that smelled of
          rose-geranium leaves, that Athalia came in. She looked conscious and confused, full of a
          delightful embarrassment at being for once alone with him. The color was deep on her
          cheeks, and her eyes were starry. </p>
        <p>"Eldress asked me to bring your </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0103" n="72"/>

        <p> mail down to you, Brother Lewis," she said. </p>

        <p>"Thalia!" he said; "I am so glad to see you, dear; I &mdash; I seem to be rather used
          up, somehow." The mists had quite cleared away, but a violent headache made his words
          stumble. "I was just wondering, Thalia &mdash; don't you think you might go home now?
          You've had a whole year of it &mdash; and I really ought to go home &mdash; the
          mill &mdash;" </p>
        <p>"Why, Lewis Hall! What do you mean!" she said, forgetting her part in her indignation. "I
          am a Shakeress. You've no right to speak so to me." </p>
        <p>He blinked at her through the blur of pain. "I wish you'd stay with me, Athalia, I've got
          a &mdash; a sort of &mdash; headache. Never mind about being a Shakeress just for
          to-night. It would be such a comfort to have you." </p>
        <p>But Athalia, with a horrified look, </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0104" n="73"/>

        <p> had left him. She fled home in the darkness with burning cheeks; she debated with
          herself whether she should tell Eldress how her husband &mdash; no, Brother Lewis
          &mdash; had tried to "tempt" her back to him. In her excitement at this lure of the
          devil she even wondered whether Lewis had pretended that he was ill, to induce her to stay
          with him? But even Athalia's imagination could not compass such a thought of Lewis for
          more than a moment, so she only told the Eldress that Brother Lewis had "tried to persuade
          her to go back to the world with him." The Lord had defended her, she said, excitedly, and
          she had forbidden him to speak to her! </p>

        <p>Eldress Hannah looked perplexed. "That's not like Lewis. I wonder &mdash;" But she
          did not say what she wondered. Instead, she went early in the morning </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0105" n="74"/>

        <p> down Lonely Lake Road to Lewis's house. The poor fellow was entirely in the mists by
          that time, shivering and burning and quite unconscious, saying over and over, "She
          wouldn't stay; she wouldn't stay." </p>

        <p>"'Lure her back,'" said Eldress Hannah, with a snort. "Poor boy! It's good riddance for
          him." </p>
        <p>But Eldress Hannah stayed, and Brother Nathan joined her, and for many days the little
          community was shaken with real anxiety, for they had all come to love the solitary,
          waiting husband. Athalia, abashed, but still cherishing the dear insult of having been
          tempted, took what little part Eldress allowed her in the care of the sick man; but in the
          six or seven weeks of his illness Brother Nathan and the Eldress were his devoted nurses,
          and by-and-by a genuine friendship grew </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0106" n="75"/>

        <p> up between them. Old Eldress Hannah's shrewd good-humor was as wholesome as a sound
          winter apple, and Nathan had a gayety Lewis had never suspected. The old man grew very
          confidential in those days of Lewis's convalescence; he showed his simple heart with a
          generosity that made the sick man's lip tighten once or twice and his eyes blur;
          &mdash; Lewis came to know all about Sister Lydia; indeed, he knew more than the old
          man knew himself. When the invalid grew stronger, Nathan wrestled with him over the
          Prophecies, and Lewis studied them and the other foundation-stones of the Shaker faith
          with a constantly increasing anxiety. "Because," he said, with a nervous blink, "if you
            <hi rend="italic">are</hi> right &mdash;" But he left the sentence unfinished. Once
          he said, with a feeble passion &mdash; for he was still very weak &mdash; "I tell
          you, </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0107" n="76"/>

        <p> Nathan, it isn't human!" and then added, under his breath, "but God knows whether that's
          not in its favor." </p>

        <p>When he was quite well again he was plainly preoccupied. He pored over the Prophecies
          with a concentration that made him blind even to Athalia's tired looks. Once, when some
          one said in his presence, "Sister 'Thalia is working too hard," he blinked at her in an
          absent way before the old, anxious attention awoke in his eyes. </p>
        <p>Athalia tossed her head and said, "Brother Lewis has his own affairs to think of, I
          guess!" </p>
        <p>And he said, eagerly: "Yes, 'Thalia; I have been thinking &mdash; Some day I'll tell
          you. But not yet." </p>
        <p>"Oh, I haven't time to pry into other people's thoughts," she said, acidly. And, indeed,
          just then her time was </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0108" n="77"/>

        <p> very full. She was enormously useful to the community that second winter; her young
          power and strength shone out against the growing weariness of the old sisters. "Athalia's
          capable," Eldress Hannah said, and the other sisters said "Yee," and smiled at one
          another. </p>

        <p>"She <hi rend="italic">is</hi> useful," Sister Jane declared; "do you know, she got
          through the churning before nine? I'd 'a' been at it until eleven!" </p>
        <p>"Athalia is like one of those candles that have a streak of soft wax in 'em," Eldress
          Hannah murmured; "but she's useful, as you say, Jane." </p>
        <p>In January, when the Eldress fell ill, Athalia was especially useful. She nursed her with
          a passion of faithfulness that made the other sisters remonstrate. </p>
        <p>"You'll wear yourself out, Athalia; </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0109" n="78"/>

        <p> you haven't had your clothes off for three days and nights!" </p>

        <p>"The Lord has upheld me, and His right hand has sustained me," Athalia quoted, with an
          uplifted look. </p>
        <p>"Yee," old Jane assented, "but He likes sense, Athalia, and there ain't any reason why
          two of us shouldn't take turns settin' up with her tonight." </p>
        <p>"This is my service," Athalia said, smiling joyously. </p>
        <p>Eldress Hannah, lying with closed eyes, said, suddenly: "Athalia, don't be foolish and
          conceited. You go right along to your bed; Jane and Mary'll look after me." </p>
        <p>It took Athalia a perceptible minute to get herself in hand sufficiently to say, meekly,
          "Yee, Eldress." When she had shut the door behind her with perhaps something more than
          Shaker emphasis,</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0110" n="79"/>

        <p> the Eldress opened her eyes and smiled at old Jane. "She's smart," she said. </p>

        <p>"Yee," said Sister Jane; and there was a little chuckle. </p>
        <p>The sick woman closed her eyes again and sighed. "What a nurse Lydia was!" she said; and
          added, suddenly: "How is Nathan getting along with Lewis? There isn't much more time, I
          guess," she ended, mildly; "she won't last it out another summer." </p>
        <p>"She's done better than I expected to stay till now," Jane said; and the Eldress nodded. </p>
        <p>But it was, perhaps, a natural result of Athalia's abounding energy that toward the end
          of that second winter in the Shaker village she should grow irritable. The spring work was
          very heavy that year. Brother William was too feeble to do even the light,</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0111" n="80"/>

        <p> pottering tasks that had been allotted to him, and his vague babblings about the spirits
          ceased altogether. In April old Jane died, and that put extra burdens on Athalia's capable
          shoulders. "But I notice I don't get anything extra for my work, not even thanks!" she
          told Lewis, sharply, and forgot to call him "Brother." She had walked down Lonely Lake
          Road and stopped at his gate. She looked thinner; her forget-me-not eyes were clouded, and
          there was an impatient line about her lips, instead of the faint, ecstatic smile which was
          part of her early experience. </p>

        <p>"Yes, there's lots of work to be done," he agreed, "but when people do it together
          &mdash;" </p>
        <p>"What do you think?" &mdash; she interrupted him, her lip drooping a little in a
          half-contemptuous smile &mdash; "they've heard again from that Sister Lydia who </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0112" n="81"/>

        <p> ran away! You know who I mean? &mdash; Brother Nathan is always talking about her.
          They think she'll come back. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should say good riddance! Though of
          course if it's genuine repentance I'll be glad. Only I don't think it is." </p>

        <p>"How pleased Nathan will be!" Lewis said. </p>
        <p>"Oh, he's pleased; he's rather too pleased for a Shaker, it strikes me." </p>
        <p>Lewis frowned. "There is joy in the presence of the angels," he reminded her, gravely. </p>
        <p>"Angels!" she said, with a laugh; "I don't believe so much in the angels as I did before
          I knew so much about them. I understand that when this 'angel' comes back I am to give up
          my room to her, if you please, because it used to be hers. Oh, I'm of no importance now
          &mdash; Lewis," she broke off,</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0113" n="82"/>

        <p> suddenly, "who has our house this year?" </p>

        <p>"Davis; he wants to re-lease it in May." </p>
        <p>"He just takes it by the year, doesn't he?" she asked. </p>
        <p>He nodded. "Wants a five-years' lease next time." </p>
        <p>"Well, don't give it to him!" she said; and added, frowning: "You ought to go back
          yourself, you know. It's foolish for you to be here. Why, it's almost two years!" </p>
        <p>"Time flies," he said, smiling. </p>
        <p>She laughed and sighed. "Yes &mdash; I mean yee &mdash; indeed, it does! I was
          just thinking, Lewis, we've been married ten years!" </p>
        <p>"No, eight years. We were married just eight years," he said, soberly. </p>
        <p>The color flew into her face. "Oh,</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0114" n="83"/>

        <p> yee; we were married eight years when I came in." </p>

        <p>He looked at her with great tenderness. "Athalia, I have to confess to you that when you
          came I didn't think it would last with you. I distrusted the Holy Spirit. And I came,
          myself, against my will, as you know. But now I begin to think you were led &mdash;
          and perhaps you have led me." </p>
        <p>Athalia gave a little gasp &mdash; <hi rend="italic">"What!"</hi>
        </p>
        <p>"I am not sure yet," he said. </p>
        <p>"You said Shakerism was unhuman!" Athalia protested, with a thrill of panic in her voice. </p>
        <p>"Ah!" he cried, his voice suddenly kindling, "you know what Nathan is always saying?
          &mdash; 'That's not against it'? Athalia, its unhumanness, as you call it, is why I
          think it may be of God. The human in us must give way to the divine. 'First that which</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0115" n="84"/>
        <p> is natural; then that which is spiritual.'" </p>

        <p>"I &mdash; don't understand," she said, faintly; "you are not a Shaker?" </p>
        <p>"No," he said, "not yet. But perhaps some day &mdash; I am trying to follow you,
          Athalia." </p>
        <p>She caught her breath with a frightened look. "Follow &mdash; <hi rend="italic"
          >me?"</hi> Then she burst out crying. </p>
        <p>"Why, Tay!" he said, bewildered; "what is it, dear?" But she had left him, stumbling
          blindly as she walked, her face hidden in her hands. </p>
        <p>Lewis went back into his house, and, lighting his lamp, sat down to pore over one of
          Brother Nathan's books. He was concerned, but he smiled a little; it was so like Athalia
          to cry when she was happy! He did not see his wife for several days. The Eldress said
          Sister 'Thalia was not well, and </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0116" n="85"/>

        <p> Lewis looked sorry, but made no comment. He was a little anxious, but he did not dwell
          upon his anxiety. In the next few days he worked hard all day in Brother Nathan's
          herb-house, where the air was hazy with the aromatic dust of tansy and pennyroyal, then
          hurried home at night to sit down to his books, so profoundly absorbed in them that
          sometimes he only knew that it was time to sleep because the dawn fell white across the
          black-lettered page. </p>

        <p>But one night, a week later, when he came home from work, he did not open his Bible; he
          stood a long time in his doorway, looking at the sunset, and, as he looked, his face
          seemed to shine with some inner light. The lake was like glass; high in the upper heavens
          thin golden lines of cloud had turned to rippling copper; the sky behind the</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0117" n="86"/>

        <p> black circle of the hills was a clear, pale green, and in the growing dusk the water
          whitened like snow. "'Glass mingled with fire,'" he murmured to himself; "yes, 'great and
          marvellous are Thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of
          Saints!'" And what more marvellous work than this wonder of his own salvation? Brought
          here against his will, against his judgment! How he had struggled against the Spirit. He
          was humbled to the earth at the remembrance of it; "if I had my way, we wouldn't have
          walked up the hill from the station that morning!" . . . </p>
        <p>The flushing heavens faded into ashes, but the solemn glow of half-astonished gratitude
          lingered on his face. </p>
        <p>"Lewis," some one said in the darkness of the lane &mdash; <hi rend="italic"
          >"Lewis!"</hi> Athalia came up the path swiftly and put her </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0118" n="87"/>

        <p> hands on his arm. "Lewis, I &mdash; I want to go home." She sobbed as she spoke. </p>

        <p>He started as if she had struck him. </p>
        <p>"Lewis, Lewis, let us go home!" </p>
        <p>The flame of mystical satisfaction went out of his face as a lighted candle goes out in
          the wind. </p>
        <p>"There isn't any home now, Athalia," he said, with a sombre look; "there's only a house.
          Come in," he added, heavily; "we must talk this out." </p>
        <p>She followed him, and for a moment they neither of them spoke; he fumbled about in the
          warm darkness for a match, and lifting the shade, lighted the lamp on the table; then he
          looked at her. "Athalia," he said, in a terrified voice, "I am &mdash; <hi
            rend="italic">I am a Shaker!"</hi>
        </p>
        <p>"No &mdash; no &mdash; no!" she said. She grew very white, and sat down,
          breathing quickly. Then the color came back </p>

        <p> faintly into her lips. "Don't say it, Lewis; it isn't true. It can't be true!" </p>

        <p>"It is true," he said, with a groan. He had sunk into a chair, and his face was hidden in
          his hands. "What are we going to do?" he said, hoarsely. </p>
        <p>"Why, you mustn't be!" she cried; "you can't be &mdash; that's all. You can't <hi
            rend="italic">stay</hi> if I go!" </p>
        <p>"I must stay," he said. </p>
        <p>There was a stunned silence. Then she said, in an amazed whisper: </p>
        <p>"What! You don't love me any more?" </p>
        <p>Still he was silent. </p>
        <p>"You &mdash; don't &mdash; love &mdash; me," she said, as if repeating some
          astounding fact, which she could not yet believe. </p>
        <p>He seemed to gather his courage up. </p>

        <p>"I have &mdash;" he tried to speak; faltered, broke, went on: "I have &mdash; the</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0120"/>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0121"/>

        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0122" n="89"/>

        <p> kindliest feelings toward you, 'Thalia" -his last word was in a whisper. </p>

        <p>"Stop!" she protested, with a frightened look &mdash; "oh, stop! &mdash; don't
          say <hi rend="italic">that!"</hi> He did not speak; and suddenly, looking at his fixed
          face, she cried out, violently: "Oh, why, why did I go up to the graveyard that day? Why
          did you let me?" She stared at him, her forget-me-not eyes dilating with dismay. "It all
          came from that. If we hadn't walked up the hill that morning &mdash;" He was
          speechless. Then, abruptly, she sprang to her feet, and, running to him, knelt beside him
          and tried to pull down the hands in which he had again hidden his face. "Lewis, it's I
          &mdash; Tay! You don't 'feel kindly' to <hi rend="italic">me?</hi> Lewis, you haven't
          stopped loving me?" </p>
        <p>"I am a Shaker," he said, helplessly.</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0123" n="90"/>

        <p> "I can't give up my religion, even for you." </p>

        <p>He got on his feet and stood before her, his empty palms hanging at his sides in that
          strange gesture of entire hopelessness; he tried to speak, but no words came. The lamp on
          the table flickered a little. Their shadows loomed gigantic on the wall behind them; the
          little hot room was very still. </p>
        <p>"You think you don't love me?" Athalia said, between set teeth; <hi rend="italic">"I know
            better!"</hi> With a laugh she caught his arm with both her shaking hands, and kissed
          him once, and then again. Still he was silent. Then with a cry she threw herself against
          his breast. "I love you," she said, passionately, "and you love me! Nothing on earth will
          make me believe you don't love me," &mdash; and for one vital moment her lips burned
          against his. </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0124" n="91"/>

        <p>His arms did not close about her, &mdash; but his hands clinched slightly. Then he
          moved back a step or two, and she heard him sigh. "Don't, sister," he said, gently. </p>
        <p>She threw up her hands with a frantic gesture. <hi rend="italic">"Sister?</hi> My God!"
          she said; and left him. </p>
        <p> * * * </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>There was no further struggle between them. A week later she went away. As he told her,
          "the house was there" &mdash; and to that she went until she should go to find some
          whirl of life that would make her deaf to voices of the past. </p>
        <p>As for Lewis, he did not see that miserable departure from the Family House in the shabby
          old carryall that had been the Shakers' one vehicle for</p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0125" n="92"/>

        <p> more than thirty years. He told Nathan he wanted to mow the burial-ground up on the hill
          that morning. From that high and silent spot he could see the long white road up from the
          settlement on one side and down to the covered bridge on the other side. He sat under the
          pine-tree, his scythe against the stone wall behind him, his clinched hands between his
          knees. Sitting thus, he watched the road and the slow crawl of the shaky old carriage. . .
          . After it had passed the burying-ground and was out of sight, he hid his face in his bent
          elbow. </p>

        <p> </p>
        <p>It was some ten years afterward that word came to Eldress Hannah that Athalia Hall was
          dying and wanted to see her husband; would he come to her? </p>
        <p>"Will you go, Brother Lewis?" El-dress asked him, doubtfully. </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0126" n="93"/>

        <p>"Yee, if you think best," he said. </p>
        <p>"I do think best," the old woman said. </p>
        <p>He went, a bent, elderly man in a gray coat, threading his wavering way through the noisy
          buffet of the streets of the city where Athalia had elected to dwell. He found her in a
          gaudy hotel, full of the glare of pushing, hurrying life. He sat down at her bedside, a
          little breathless, and looked at her with mild, remote eyes. </p>
        <p>"Do you forgive me, Lewis?" she said. </p>
        <p>"I have nothing to forgive, sister," he told her. </p>
        <p>"Don't call me that!" she cried, with feeble passion. </p>
        <p>He looked a little bewildered. "Yee," he said, "I forgive you." </p>
        <p>"Oh, Lewis! &mdash; Lewis! &mdash; Lewis!" she mourned; "this is what I have </p>
        <pb entity="DSSR_000002487_0127" n="94"/>

        <p> done!" She wept pitifully. His face grew vaguely troubled, as if he did not quite
          understand. . . . Then, abruptly, the veil lifted: his eyes dilated with pain; he passed
          his hand over his forehead once or twice and sighed. Then he looked down at the poor,
          dying face that once he had loved. </p>
        <p>"Why, 'Thalia!" he said, in a surprised and anguished voice; suddenly he put his arm
          under the restless head. "There, there, little Tay; don't cry," he said, and smiled at
          her. </p>
        <p>And with that she was content to fall asleep. </p>
        <p> THE END </p>
