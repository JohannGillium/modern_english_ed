<head>THE BESETMENT OF KURT LIEDERS</head> 
<p> 
A SILVER rime glistened all down the street. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
There was a drabble of dead leaves on the 
sidewalk which was of wood, and on the roadway 
which was of macadam and stiff mud. The wind 
blew sharply, for it was a December day and only 
six in the morning. Nor were the houses high 
enough to furnish any independent bulwark; 
they were low, wooden dwellings, the tallest a 
bare two stories in height, the majority only one 
story. But they were in good painting and 
repair, and most of them had a homely gayety of 
geraniums or bouvardias in the windows. The 
house on the corner was the tall house. It occupied  
a larger yard than its neighbors; and there 
were lace curtains tied with blue ribbons for the 
windows in the right hand front room. The door 
of this house swung back with a crash, and a 
woman darted out. She ran at the top of her 
speed to the little yellow house farther down the 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0029" n="4"/> 
 
street. Her blue calico gown clung about her 
stout figure and fluttered behind her, revealing 
her blue woollen stockings and felt slippers. Her 
gray head was bare. As she ran tears rolled 
down her cheeks and she wrung her hands. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, lieber Herr Je!" One 
near would have heard her sob, in too distracted 
agitation to heed the motorneer of the passing 
street-car who stared after her at the risk of his 
car, or the tousled heads behind a few curtains. 
She did not stop until she almost fell against the 
door of the yellow house. Her frantic knocking 
was answered by a young woman in a light and 
artless costume of a quilted petticoat and a red 
flannel sack. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, gracious goodness! Mrs. Lieders!" cried 
she. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Thekla Lieders rather staggered than walked into 
the room and fell back on the black haircloth sofa. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"There, there, there," said the young woman 
while she patted the broad shoulders heaving 
between sobs and short breath, "what is it? The 
house aint afire?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, no, oh, Mrs. Olsen, he has done it again!" 
She wailed in sobs, like a child. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Done it? Done what?" exclaimed Mrs. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0030" n="5"/> 
 
Olsen, then her face paled. "Oh, my gracious, 
you <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> mean he's killed himself &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, he's killed himself, again." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"And he's dead?" asked the other in an awed 
tone. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Mrs. Lieders gulped down her tears. "Oh, not 
so bad as that, I cut him down, he was up in the 
garret and I sus &mdash; suspected him and I run up 
and &mdash; oh, he was there, a choking, and he was so 
mad! He swore at me and &mdash; he kicked me when 
I &mdash; I says: 'Kurt, what are you doing of? Hold 
on till I git a knife,' I says &mdash; for his hands was 
just dangling at his side; and he says nottings 
cause he couldn't, he was most gone, and I 
knowed I wouldn't have time to git no knife but 
I saw it was a rope was pretty bad worn and so &mdash; 
so I just run and jumped and ketched it in my 
hands, and being I'm so fleshy it couldn't stand 
no more and it broke! And, oh! he &mdash; he kicked 
me when I was try to come near to git the rope 
off his neck; and so soon like he could git his 
breath he swore at me &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"And you a helping of him! Just listen to 
that!" cried the hearer indignantly. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"So I come here for to git you and Mr. Olsen 
to help me git him down stairs, 'cause he is too 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0031" n="6"/> 
 
heavy for me to lift, and he is so mad he won't 
walk down himself." 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, yes, of course. I'll call Carl. Carl! dost 
thou hear? come! But did you dare to leave 
him Mrs. Lieders?" Part of the time she spoke 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0032" n="7"/> 
 
in English, part of the time in her own tongue, 
gliding from one to another, and neither party 
observing the transition. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Mrs. Lieders wiped her eyes, saying: "Oh, yes, 
Danke sch&ouml;n, I aint afraid 'cause I tied him with 
the rope, righd good, so he don't got no chance 
to move. He was make faces at me all the time 
I tied him." At the remembrance, the tears 
welled anew. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Mrs. Olsen, a little bright tinted woman with a 
nose too small for her big blue eyes and chubby 
cheeks, quivered with indignant sympathy. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, I did nefer hear of sooch a mean acting 
man!" seemed to her the most natural expression; 
but the wife fired, at once. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No, he is not a mean man," she cried, "no, 
Freda Olsen, he is not a mean man at all! There 
aint nowhere a better man than my man; and 
Carl Olsen, he knows that. Kurt, he always buys 
a whole ham and a whole barrel of flour, and 
never less than a dollar of sugar at a time! And 
he never gits drunk nor he never gives me any 
bad talk. It was only he got this wanting to kill 
himself on him, sometimes." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, I guess I'll go put on my things," said 
Mrs. Olsen, wisely declining to defend her position. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0033" n="8"/> 
 
"You set right still and warm yourself, 
and we'll be back in a minute." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Indeed, it was hardly more than that time 
before both Carl Olsen, who worked in the same 
furniture factory as Kurt Lieders, and was a 
comely and after-witted giant, appeared with 
Mrs. Olsen ready for the street. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He nodded at Mrs. Lieders and made a 
gurgling noise in his throat, expected to convey 
sympathy. Then, he coughed and said that he 
was ready, and they started. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Feeling further expression demanded, Mrs. 
Olsen asked: "How many times has he done 
it, Mrs. Lieders?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Mrs. Lieders was trotting along, her anxious 
eyes on the house in the distance, especially 
on the garret windows. "Three times," she 
answered, not removing her eyes; "onct he 
tooked Rough on Rats and I found it out and I 
put some apple butter in the place of it, and he 
kept wondering and wondering how he didn't feel 
notings, and after awhile I got him off the notion, 
that time. He wasn't mad at me; he just said: 
'Well, I do it some other time. You see!' but 
he promised to wait till I got the spring house 
cleaning over, so he could shake the carpets for 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0034" n="9"/> 
 
me; and by and by he got feeling better. He 
was mad at the boss and that made him feel bad. 
The next time it was the same, that time he 
jumped into the cistern &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, I know," said Olsen, with a half grin, 
"I pulled him out." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"It was the razor he wanted," the wife continued, 
"and when he come home and says he 
was going to leave the shop and he aint never 
going back there, and gets out his razor and 
sharps it, I knowed what that meant and I told 
him I got to have some bluing and wouldn't he 
go and get it? and he says, 'You won't git 
another husband run so free on your errands, 
Thekla,' and I says I don't want none; and when 
he was gone I hid the razor and he couldn't find 
it, but that didn't mad him, he didn't say notings; 
and when I went to git the supper he 
walked out in the yard and jumped into the 
cistern, and I heard the splash and looked in and 
there he was trying to git his head under, and I 
called, 'For the Lord's sake, papa! For the 
Lord's sake!' just like that. And I fished for 
him with the pole that stood there and he was 
sorry and caught hold of it and give in, and I 
rested the pole agin the side cause I wasn't 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0035" n="10"/> 
 
strong enough to h'ist him out; and he held on 
whilest I run for help &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"And I got the ladder and he clum out," said 
the giant with another grin of recollection, "he 
was awful wet!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"That was a month ago," said the wife, solemnly. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"He sharped the razor onct," said Mrs. Lieders, 
"but he said it was for to shave him, and I 
got him to promise to let the barber shave him 
sometime, instead. Here, Mrs. Olsen, you go 
righd in, the door aint locked." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
By this time they were at the house door. 
They passed in and ascended the stairs to the 
second story, then climbed a narrow, ladder-like 
flight to the garret. Involuntarily they had 
paused to listen at the foot of the stairs, but it 
was very quiet, not a sound of movement, not so 
much as the sigh of a man breathing. The wife 
turned pale and put both her shaking hands on 
her heart. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Guess he's trying to scare us by keeping 
quiet!" said Olsen, cheerfully, and he stumbled 
up the stairs, in advance. "Thunder!" he exclaimed, 
on the last stair, "well, we aint any too 
quick." 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0036" n="11"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
In fact Carl had nearly fallen over the master 
of the house, that enterprising self-destroyer having  
contrived, pinioned as he was, to roll over to 
the very brink of the stair well, with the plain 
intent to break his neck by plunging headlong. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
In the dim light all that they could see was 
a small, old man whose white hair was strung 
in wisps over his purple face, whose deep set 
eyes glared like the eyes of a rat in a trap, 
and whose very elbows and knees expressed in 
their cramps the fury of an outraged soul. 
When he saw the new-comers he shut his eyes 
and his jaws. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, Mr. Lieders," said Olsen, mildly, "I 
guess you better git down-stairs. Kin I help 
you up?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No," said Lieders. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Will I give you an arm to lean on?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Won't you go at all, Mr. Lieders?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Olsen shook his head. "I hate to trouble 
you, Mr. Lieders," said he in his slow, undecided 
tones, "please excuse me," with which he 
gathered up the little man into his strong arms 
and slung him over his shoulders, as easily as 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0037" n="12"/> 
 
he would sling a sack of meal. It was a vent 
for Mrs. Olsen's bubbling indignation to make 
a dive for Lieders's heels and hold them, while 
Carl backed down-stairs. But Lieders did not 
make the least resistance. He allowed them to 
carry him into the room indicated by his wife, 
and to lay him bound on the plump feather 
bed. It was not his bedroom but the sacred 
"spare room," and the bed was part of its 
luxury. Thekla ran in, first, to remove the 
embroidered pillow shams and the dazzling, 
silken "crazy quilt" that was her choicest possession. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Safely in the bed, Lieders opened his eyes 
and looked from one face to the other, his lip 
curling. "You can't keep me this way all the 
time. I can do it in spite of you," said he. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, I think you had ought to be ashamed 
of yourself, Mr. Lieders!" Mrs. Olsen burst out, 
in a tremble between wrath and exertion, shaking 
her little, plump fist at him. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
But the placid Carl only nodded, as in sympathy, 
saying, "Well, I am sorry you feel so bad, 
Mr. Lieders. I guess we got to go now." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Mrs. Olsen looked as if she would have liked 
to exhort Lieders further; but she shrugged 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0038" n="13"/> 
 
her shoulders and followed her husband in silence. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I wished you'd stay to breakfast, now you're 
here," Thekla urged out of her imperious hospitality; 
had Kurt been lying there dead, the next 
meal must have been offered, just the same. "I 
know, you aint got time to git Mr. Olsen his 
breakfast, Freda, before he has got to go to the 
shops, and my tea-kettle is boiling now, and the 
coffee'll be ready &mdash; I <hi rend="italic">guess</hi> you had better stay." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
But Mrs. Olsen seconded her husband's denial, 
and there was nothing left Thekla but to see 
them to the door. No sooner did she return 
than Lieders spoke. "Aint you going to take off 
them ropes?" said he. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Not till you promise you won't do it." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Silence. Thekla, brushing a few tears from 
her eyes, scrutinized the ropes again, before she 
walked heavily out of the room. She turned the 
key in the door. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Directly a savory steam floated through the 
hall and pierced the cracks about the door; then 
Thekla's footsteps returned; they echoed over 
the uncarpeted boards. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
She had brought his breakfast, cooked with the 
best of her homely skill. The pork chops that he 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0039" n="14"/> 
 
liked had been fried, there was a napkin on the 
tray, and the coffee was in the best gilt cup and 
saucer. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Here's your breakfast, papa," said she, trying 
to smile. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I don't want no breakfast," said he. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
She waited, holding the tray, and wistfully eying  
him. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Take it 'way," said he, "I won't touch it if 
you stand till doomsday, lessen you untie me!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I'll untie your arm, papa, one arm; you 
kin eat that way." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Not lessen you untie all of me, I won't 
touch a bite." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"You know why I won't untie you, papa." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Starving will kill as dead as hanging," was 
Lieders's orphic response to this. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Thekla sighed and went away, leaving the 
tray on the table. It may be that she hoped 
the sight of food might stir his stomach to 
rebel against his dogged will; if so she was 
disappointed; half an hour went by during 
which the statue under the bedclothes remained 
without so much as a quiver, 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Then the old woman returned. "Aint you 
awful cramped and stiff, papa?" 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0040" n="15"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes," said the statue. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Will you promise not to do yourself a mischief, 
if I untie you?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Thekla groaned, while the tears started to 
her red eyelids. "But you'll git awful tired 
and it will hurt you if you don't get the ropes 
off, soon, papa!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I know that!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He closed his eyes again, to be the less hindered  
from dropping back into his distempered 
musings. Thekla took a seat by his side and sat 
silent as he. Slowly the natural pallor returned 
to the high forehead and sharp features. They 
were delicate features and there was an air of 
refinement, of thought, about Lieders's whole 
person, as different as possible from the robust 
comeliness of his wife. With its keen sensitiveness  
and its undefined melancholy it was a 
dreamer's face. One meets such faces, sometimes, 
in incongruous places and wonders what 
they mean. In fact, Kurt Lieders, head cabinet 
maker in the furniture factory of Lossing &amp; Co., 
was an artist. He was, also, an incomparable 
artisan and the most exacting foreman in the 
shops. Thirty years ago he had first taken wages 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0041" n="16"/> 
 
from the senior Lossing. He had watched a 
modest industry climb up to a great business, nor 
was he all at sea in his own estimate of his share 
in the firm's success. Lieders's workmanship had 
an honesty, an infinite patience of detail, a daring 
skill of design that came to be sought and commanded  
its own price. The Lossing "art furniture" 
did not slander the name. No sculptor 
ever wrought his soul into marble with a more 
unflinching conscience or a purer joy in his 
work than this wood-carver dreaming over side-boards and bedsteads. Unluckily, Lieders had 
the wrong side of the gift as well as the right; 
was full of whims and crotchets, and as unpractical  
as the Christian martyrs. He openly defied 
expense, and he would have no trifling with 
the laws of art. To make after orders was an 
insult to Kurt. He made what was best for 
the customer; if the latter had not the sense 
to see it he was a fool and a pig, and some one 
else should work for him, not Kurt Lieders, 
<hi rend="italic">begehr!</hi> 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Young Lossing had learned the business practically. 
He was taught the details by his father's 
best workman; and a mighty hard and strict 
master the best workman proved! Lossing did 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0042" n="17"/> 
 
not dream that the crabbed old tyrant who rarely 
praised him, who made him go over, for the 
twentieth time, any imperfect piece of work, who 
exacted all the artisan virtues to the last inch, 
was secretly proud of him. Yet, in fact, the 
thread of romance in Lieders's prosaic life was his 
idolatry of the Lossing Manufacturing Co. It is 
hard to tell whether it was the Lossings or that 
intangible quantity, the firm, the business, that he 
worshipped. Worship he did, however, the one 
or the other, perhaps the both of them, though in 
the peevish and erratic manner of the savage who 
sometimes grovels to his idols and sometimes 
kicks them. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Nobody guessed what a blow it was to Kurt 
when, a year ago, the elder Lossing had died. 
Even his wife did not connect his sullen melancholy  
and his gibes at the younger generation, 
with the crape on Harry Lossing's hat. He 
would not go to the funeral, but worked savagely, 
all alone by himself, in the shop, the whole after-noon &mdash; breaking down at last at the sight of a 
carved panel over which Lossing and he had once 
disputed. The desolate loneliness of the old 
came to him when his old master was gone. He 
loved the young man, but the old man was of 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0043" n="18"/> 
 
his own generation; he had "known how things 
ought to be and he could understand without 
talking." Lieders began to be on the lookout for 
signs of waning consideration, to watch his own 
eyes and hands, drearily wondering when they 
would begin to play him false; at the same time 
because he was unhappy he was ten times as 
exacting and peremptory and critical with the 
younger workmen, and ten times as insolently 
independent with the young master. Often 
enough, Lossing was exasperated to the point of 
taking the old man at his word and telling him to 
go if he would, but every time the chain of long 
habit, a real respect for such faithful service, and 
a keen admiration for Kurt's matchless skill in his 
craft, had held him back. He prided himself on 
keeping his word; for that reason he was warier 
of using it. So he would compromise by giving 
the domineering old fellow a "good, stiff rowing." 
Once, he coupled this with a threat, if they could 
not get along decently they would better part! 
Lieders had answered not a word; he had given 
Lossing a queer glance and turned on his heel. 
He went home and bought some poison on the 
way. "The old man is gone and the young feller 
don't want the old crank round, no more," he 
 
</p> 
 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0044"/> 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0045" n="20"/> 
 
<p> 
 
said to himself. "Thekla, I guess I make her 
troubles, too; I'll git out!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
That was the beginning of his tampering with 
suicide. Thekla, who did not have the same 
opinion of the "trouble," had interfered. He 
had married Thekla to have someone to keep a 
warm fireside for him, but she was an ignorant 
creature who never could be made to understand 
about carving. He felt sorry for her when the 
baby died, the only child they ever had; he was 
sorrier than he expected to be on his own account, 
too, for it was an ugly little creature, only 
four days old, and very red and wrinkled; but he 
never thought of confiding his own griefs or trials 
to her. Now, it made him angry to have that 
stupid Thekla keep him in a world where he did 
not wish to stay. If the next day Lossing had 
not remembered how his father valued Lieders, 
and made an excuse to half apologize to him, I 
fear Thekla's stratagems would have done little 
good. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The next experience was cut out of the same 
piece of cloth. He had relented, he had allowed 
his wife to save him; but he was angry in secret. 
Then came the day when open disobedience to 
Lossing's orders had snapped the last thread of 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0046" n="21"/> 
 
Harry's patience. To Lieders's aggrieved "If 
you ain't satisfied with my work, Mr. Lossing, I 
kin quit," the answer had come instantly, "Very 
well, Lieders, I'm sorry to lose you, but we can't 
have two bosses here: you can go to the desk." 
And when Lieders in a blind stab of temper had 
growled a prophecy that Lossing would regret it, 
Lossing had stabbed in turn: "Maybe, but it 
will be a cold day when I ask you to come back." 
And he had gone off without so much as a word 
of regret. The old workman had packed up his 
tools, the pet tools that no one was ever permitted  
to touch, and crammed his arms into his 
coat and walked out of the place where he had 
worked so long, not a man saying a word. Lieders  
didn't reflect that they knew nothing of the 
quarrel. He glowered at them and went away 
sore at heart. We make a great mistake when 
we suppose that it is only the affectionate that 
desire affection; sulky and ill-conditioned souls 
often have a passionate longing for the very feelings  
that they repel. Lieders was a womanish, 
sensitive creature under the surly mask, and he 
was cut to the quick by his comrades' apathy. 
"There ain't no place for old men in this world," 
he thought, "there's them boys I done my best 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0047" n="22"/> 
 
to make do a good job, and some of 'em I've 
worked overtime to help; and not one of 'em has 
got as much as a good-by in him for me!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
But he did not think of going to poor Thekla 
for comfort, he went to his grim dreams. "I git 
my property all straight for Thekla, and then 
I quit," said he. Perhaps he gave himself a 
reprieve unconsciously, thinking that something 
might happen to save him from himself. Nothing 
happened. None of the "boys" came to see him, 
except Carl Olsen, the very stupidest man in the 
shop, who put Lieders beside himself fifty times 
a day. The other men were sorry that Lieders 
had gone, having a genuine workman's admiration 
for his skill, and a sort of underground liking for 
the unreasonable old man because he was so absolutely  
honest and "a fellow could always tell 
where to find him." But they were shy, they 
were afraid he would take their pity in bad part, 
they "waited a while." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Carl, honest soul, stood about in Lieders's 
workshop, kicking the shavings with his heels 
for half an hour, and grinned sheepishly, and was 
told what a worthless, scamping, bragging lot the 
"boys" at Lossing's were, and said he guessed he 
had got to go home now; and so departed, unwitting 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0048" n="23"/> 
 
that his presence had been a consolation. 
Mrs. Olsen asked Carl what Lieders said; 
 
</p> 
 

 
<p> 
 
Carl answered simply, "Say, Freda, that man 
feels terrible bad." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Meanwhile Thekla seemed easily satisfied. She 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0049" n="24"/> 
 
made no outcry as Lieders had dreaded, over his 
leaving the shop. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, then, papa, you don't need git up so 
early in the morning no more, if you aint going  
to the shop," was her only comment; and 
Lieders despised the mind of woman more than 
ever. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
But that evening, while Lieders was down town 
(occupied, had she known it, with a codicil to his 
will), she went over to the Olsens and found out 
all Carl could tell her about the trouble in the 
shop. And it was she that made the excuse of 
marketing to go out the next day, that she might 
see the rich widow on the hill who was talking 
about a china closet, and Judge Trevor, who had 
asked the price of a mantel, and Mr. Martin, who 
had looked at sideboards (all this information 
came from honest Carl); and who proposed to 
them that they order such furniture of the best 
cabinet-maker in the country, now setting up on 
his own account. He, simple as a baby for all his 
doggedness, thought that they came because of 
his fame as a workman, and felt a glow of pride, 
particularly as (having been prepared by the wife, 
who said, "You see it don't make so much difference  
with my Kurt 'bout de prize, if so he can 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0050" n="25"/> 
 
get the furniture like he wants it, and he always 
know of the best in the old country") they all 
were duly humble. He accepted a few orders 
and went to work with a will; he would show 
them what the old man could do. But it was 
only a temporary gleam; in a little while he grew 
homesick for the shop, for the sawdust floor and 
the familiar smell of oil, and the picture of Lossing  
flitting in and out. He missed the careless 
young workmen at whom he had grumbled, he 
missed the whir of machinery, and the consciousness  
of rush and hurry accented by the cars on 
the track outside. In short, he missed the feeling  
of being part of a great whole. At home, in 
his cosey little improvised shop, there was none 
to dispute him, but there was none to obey him 
either. He grew deathly tired of it all. He got 
into the habit of walking around the shops at 
night, prowling about his old haunts like a cat. 
Once the night watchman saw him. The next 
day there was a second watchman engaged. And 
Olsen told him very kindly, meaning only to warn 
him, that he was suspected to be there for no 
good purpose. Lieders confirmed a lurking suspicion  
of the good Carl's own, by the clouding 
of his face. Yet he would have chopped his 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0051" n="26"/> 
 
hand off rather than have lifted it against the 
shop. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
That was Tuesday night, this was Wednesday  
morning. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The memory of it all, the cruel sense of 
injustice, returned with such poignant force 
that Lieders groaned aloud. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Instantly, Thekla was bending over him. He 
did not know whether to laugh at her or to 
swear, for she began fumbling at the ropes, 
half sobbing. "Yes, I knowed they was hurting  
you, papa; I'm going to loose one arm. 
Then I put it back again and loose the other. 
Please don't be bad!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He made no resistance and she was as good 
as her word. She unbound and bound him 
in sections, as it were; he watching her with a 
morose smile. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Then she left the room, but only to return 
with some hot coffee. Lieders twisted his 
head away. "No," said he, "I don't eat none 
of that breakfast, not if you make fresh coffee 
all the morning; I feel like I don't eat never 
no more on earth." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Thekla knew that the obstinate nature that 
she tempted was proof against temptation; if 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0052" n="27"/> 
 
Kurt chose to starve, starve he would with 
food at his elbow. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, papa," she cried, helplessly, "what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> 
the matter with you?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Just dying is the matter with me, Thekla. 
If I can't die one way I kin another. Now 
Thekla, I want you to quit crying and listen. 
After I'm gone you go to the boss, young 
Mr. Lossing &mdash; but I always called him Harry 
because he learned his trade of me, Thekla, 
but he don't think of that now &mdash; and you tell 
him old Lieders that worked for him thirty 
years is dead, but he didn't hold no hard feelings, 
he knowed he done wrong 'bout that 
mantel. Mind you tell him." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, papa," said Thekla, which was a surprise  
to Kurt; he had dreaded a weak flood of 
tears and protestations. But there were no 
tears, no protestations, only a long look at him 
and a contraction of the eyebrows as if Thekla 
were trying to think of something that eluded 
her. She placed the coffee on the tray beside 
the other breakfast. For a while the room 
was very still. Lieders could not see the look 
of resolve that finally smoothed the perplexed 
lines out of his wife's kind, simple old face. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0053" n="28"/> 
 
She rose. "Kurt," she said, "I don't guess 
you remember this is our wedding-day; it was 
this day, eighteen year we was married." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"So!" said Lieders, "well, I was a bad bargain  
to you, Thekla; after you nursed your 
father that was a cripple for twenty years, I 
thought it would be easy with me; but I was a 
bad bargain." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"The Lord knows best about that," said 
Thekla, simply, "be it how it be, you are the 
only man I ever had or will have, and I don't 
like you starve yourself. Papa, say you don't 
kill yourself, to-day, and dat you will eat your 
breakfast!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes," Lieders repeated in German, "a bad 
bargain for thee, that is sure. But thou hast 
been a good bargain for me. Here! I promise. 
Not this day. Give me the coffee." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He had seasons, all the morning, of wondering  
over his meekness, and his agreement to 
be tied up again, at night. But still, what did 
a day matter? a man humors women's notions; 
and starving was so tedious. Between whiles 
he elaborated a scheme to attain his end. How 
easy to outwit the silly Thekla! His eyes shone, 
as he hid the little, sharp knife up his cuff. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0054" n="29"/> 
 
"Let her tie me!" says Lieders, "I keep my 
word. To-morrow I be out of this. He won't 
git a man like me, pretty soon!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Thekla went about her daily tasks, with her 
every-day air; but, now and again, that same 
pucker of thought returned to her forehead; 
and, more than once, Lieders saw her stand 
over some dish, poising her spoon in air, too 
abstracted to notice his cynical observation. 
 
</p> 
 

 
<p> 
The dinner 
was more 
elaborate than 
common, and 
Thekla had 
broached a 
bottle of her 
currant wine. 
She gravely 
drank Lieders's health. 
"And many 
good days, 
papa," she 
said. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Lieders felt 
a queer movement 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0055" n="30"/> 
 
of pity. After the table was cleared, he 
helped his wife to wash and wipe the dishes as 
his custom was of a Sunday or holiday. He 
wiped dishes as he did everything, neatly, slowly, 
with a careful deliberation. Not until the dishes 
were put away and the couple were seated, did 
Thekla speak. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Kurt," she said, "I got to talk to you." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
An inarticulate groan and a glance at the door 
from Lieders. "I just got to, papa. It aint 
righd for you to do the way you been doing for 
so long time; efery little whiles you try to kill 
yourself; no, papa, that aint righd!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Kurt, who had gotten out his pencils and compasses  
and other drawing tools, grunted: "I got 
to look at my work, Thekla, now; I am too busy 
to talk." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No, Kurt, no, papa" &mdash; the hands holding the 
blue apron that she was embroidering with white 
linen began to tremble; Lieders had not the least 
idea what a strain it was on this reticent, slow of 
speech woman who had stood in awe of him for 
eighteen years, to discuss the horror of her life; 
but he could not help marking her agitation. 
She went on, desperately: "Yes, papa, I got to 
talk it oud with you. You had ought to listen, 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0056" n="31"/> 
 
'cause I always been a good wife to you and nefer 
refused you notings. No." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, I aint saying I done it 'cause you been 
bad to me; everybody knows we aint had no 
trouble." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"But everybody what don't know us, when 
they read how you tried to kill yourself in the 
papers, they think it was me. That always is so. 
And now I never can any more sleep nights, for 
you is always maybe git up and do something to 
yourself. So now, I got to talk to you, papa. 
Papa, how could you done so?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Lieders twisted his feet under the rungs of his 
chair; he opened his mouth, but only to shut it 
again with a click of his teeth. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I got my mind made up, papa. I tought 
and I tought. I know <hi rend="italic">why</hi> you done it; you 
done it 'cause you and the boss was mad at each 
other. The boss hadn't no righd to let you 
go &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, he had, I madded him first; I was a 
fool. Of course I knowed more than him 'bout 
the work, but I hadn't no right to go against 
him. The boss is all right." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, papa, I got my mind made up" &mdash; like 
most sluggish spirits there was an immense 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0057" n="32"/> 
 
momentum about Thekla's mind, once get it 
fairly started it was not to be diverted &mdash; "you 
never killed yourself before you used to git mad 
at the boss. You was afraid he would send you 
away; and now you have sent yourself away you 
don't want to live, 'cause you do not know how 
you can git along without the shop. But you 
want to get back, you want to get back more as 
you want to kill yourself. Yes, papa, I know, I 
know where you did used to go, nights. Now" 
&mdash; she changed her speech unconsciously to the 
tongue of her youth &mdash; "it is not fair, it is not fair 
to me that thou shouldst treat me like that, thou 
dost belong to me, also; so I say, my Kurt, wilt 
thou make a bargain with me? If I shall get 
thee back thy place wilt thou promise me never 
to kill thyself any more?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Lieders had not once looked up at her during 
the slow, difficult sentences with their half 
choked articulation; but he was experiencing 
some strange emotions, and one of them was a 
novel respect for his wife. All he said was: 
"'Taint no use talking. I won't never ask him 
to take me back, once." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, you aint asking of him. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> ask him. I 
try to git you back, once!" 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0058" n="33"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I tell you, it aint no use; I know the boss, he 
aint going to be letting womans talk him over; 
no, he's a good man, he knows how to work his 
business himself!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"But would you promise me, Kurt?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Lieders's eyes blurred with a mild and dreamy 
mist; he sighed softly. "Thekla, you can't see 
how it is. It is like you are tied up, if I don't 
can do that; if I can then it is always that I am 
free, free to go, free to stay. And for you, 
Thekla, it is the same." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Thekla's mild eyes flashed. "I don't believe 
you would like it so you wake up in the morning 
and find <hi rend="italic">me</hi> hanging up in the kitchen by the 
clothes-line!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Lieders had the air of one considering deeply. 
Then he gave Thekla one of the surprises of her 
life; he rose from his chair, he walked in his shuffling, 
unheeled slippers across the room to where 
the old woman sat; he put one arm on the back 
of the chair and stiffly bent over her and kissed 
her. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Lieber Herr Je!" gasped Thekla. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Then I shall go, too, pretty quick, that is all, 
mamma," said he. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Thekla wiped her eyes. A little pause fell 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0059" n="34"/> 
 
between them, and in it they may have both 
remembered vanished, half-forgotten days when 
life had looked differently to them, when they 
had never thought to sit by their own fireside 
and discuss suicide. The husband spoke first; 
with a reluctant, half-shamed smile, "Thekla, I 
tell you what, I make the bargain with you; 
you git me back that place, I don't do it again, 
'less you let me; you don't git me back that 
place, you don't say notings to me." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The apron dropped from the withered, brown 
hands to the floor. Again there was silence; but 
not for long; ghastly as was the alternative, the 
proposal offered a chance to escape from the 
terror that was sapping her heart. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"How long will you give me, papa?" said she. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I give you a week," said he. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Thekla rose and went to the door; as she 
opened it a fierce gust of wind slashed her like 
a knife, and Lieders exclaimed, fretfully, "what 
you opening that door for, Thekla, letting in the 
wind? I'm so cold, now, right by the fire, I 
most can't draw. We got to keep a fire in the 
base-burner good, all night, or the plants will 
freeze." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Thekla said confusedly that something sounded 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0060" n="35"/> 
 
like a cat crying. "And you talking like that it 
frightened me; maybe I was wrong to make such 
bargains &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Then don't make it," said Lieders, curtly, "I 
aint asking you." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
But Thekla drew a long breath and straightened  
herself, saying, "Yes, I make it, papa, I 
make it." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, put another stick of wood in the stove, 
will you, now you are up?" said Lieders, shrugging  
his shoulders, "or I'll freeze in spite of you! 
It seems to me it grows colder every minute." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
But all that day he was unusually gentle with 
Thekla. He talked of his youth and the struggles  
of the early days of the firm; he related a 
dozen tales of young Lossing, all illustrating some 
admirable trait that he certainly had not praised 
at the time. Never had he so opened his heart 
in regard to his own ideals of art, his own ambitions. 
And Thekla listened, not always comprehending  
but always sympathizing; she was almost  
like a comrade, Kurt thought afterward. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The next morning, he was surprised to have her 
appear equipped for the street, although it was 
bitterly cold. She wore her garb of ceremony, a 
black alpaca gown, with a white crocheted collar 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0061" n="36"/> 
 
neatly turned over the long black, broadcloth 
cloak in which she had taken pride for the last 
five years; and her quilted black silk bonnet was 
on her gray head. When she put up her foot to 
don her warm overshoes Kurt saw that the stout 
ankles were encased in white stockings. This 
was the last touch. "Gracious, Thekla," cried 
Kurt, "are you going to market this day? It is 
the coldest day this winter!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, I don't mind," replied Thekla, nervously. 
Then she had wrapped a scarf about her and 
gone out while he was getting into his own coat, 
and conning a proffer to go in her stead. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, well, Thekla she aint such a fool like she 
looks!" he observed to the cat, "say, pussy, <hi rend="italic">was</hi> 
it you out yestiddy?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The cat only blinked her yellow eyes and 
purred. She knew that she had not been out, 
last night. Not any better than her mistress, 
however, who at this moment was hailing a 
street-car. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The street-car did not land her anywhere near 
a market; it whirled her past the lines of low 
wooden houses into the big brick shops with 
their arched windows and terra-cotta ornaments 
that showed the ambitious architecture of a 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0062" n="37"/> 
 
growing Western town, past these into mills and 
factories and smoke-stained chimneys. Here, she 
stopped. An acquaintance would hardly have 
recognized her, her ruddy cheeks had grown so 
pale. But she trotted on to the great building 
on the corner from whence came a low, incessant 
buzz. She went into the first door and ran 
against Carl Olsen. "Carl, I got to see Mr. 
Lossing," said she breathlessly. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"There ain't noding &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No, Gott sei dank', but I got to see him." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
It was not Carl's way to ask questions; he 
promptly showed her the office and she entered. 
She had not seen young Harry Lossing half a 
dozen times; and, now, her anxious eyes wandered  
from one dapper figure at the high desks, 
to another, until Lossing advanced to her. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He was a handsome young man, she thought, 
and he had kind eyes, but they hardened at her 
first timid sentence: "I am Mrs. Lieders, I come 
about my man &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Will you walk in here, Mrs. Lieders?" said 
Lossing. His voice was like the ice on the window-panes. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
She followed him into a little room. He shut 
the door. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0063" n="38"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Declining the chair that he pushed toward her 
she stood in the centre of the room, looking at 
him with the pleading eyes of a child. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Mr. Lossing, will you please save my Kurt 
from killing himself?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"What do you mean?" Lossing's voice had 
not thawed. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"It is for you that he will kill himself, Mr. 
Lossing. This is the dird time he has done it. 
It is because he is so lonesome now, your father 
is died and he thinks that you forget, and he has 
worked so hard for you, but he thinks that you 
forget. He was never tell me till yesterday; and 
then &mdash; it was &mdash; it was because I would not let him 
hang himself &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Hang himself?" stammered Lossing, "you 
don't mean &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, he was hang himself, but I cut him, no I 
broke him down," said Thekla, accurate in all the 
disorder of her spirits; and forthwith, with many 
tremors, but clearly, she told the story of Kurt's 
despair. She told, as Lieders never would have 
known how to tell, even had his pride let him, all 
the man's devotion for the business, all his personal  
attachment to the firm; she told of his 
gloom after the elder Lossing died, "for he was 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0064" n="39"/> 
 
think there was no one in this town such good 
man and so smart like your fader, Mr. Lossing, 
no, and he would set all the evening and try 
 
</p> 
 

 
<p> 
 
to draw and make the lines all wrong, and, then, 
he would drow the papers in the fire and go 
and walk outside and he say, 'I can't do nothing 
righd no more now the old man's died; they don't 
have no use for me at the shop, pretty quick!' and 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0065" n="40"/> 
 
that make him feel awful bad!" She told of his 
homesick wanderings about the shops by night; 
"but he was better as a watchman, he wouldn't 
hurt it for the world! He telled me how you 
was hide his dinner-pail onct for a joke, and put 
in a piece of your pie, and how you climbed on 
the roof with the hose when it was afire. And 
he telled me if he shall die I shall tell you that 
he ain't got no hard feelings, but you didn't know 
how that mantel had ought to be, so he done it 
righd the other way, but he hadn't no righd to 
talk to you like he done, nohow, and you was all 
righd to send him away, but you might a shaked 
hands, and none of the boys never said nothing 
nor none of them never come to see him, 'cept 
Carl Olsen, and that make him feel awful bad, 
too! And when he feels so bad he don't no more 
want to live, so I make him promise if I git him 
back he never try to kill himself again. Oh, Mr. 
Lossing, please don't let my man die!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Bewildered and more touched than he cared to 
feel, himself, Lossing still made a feeble stand for 
discipline. "I don't see how Lieders can expect 
me to take him back again," he began. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"He aint expecting you, Mr. Lossing, it's 
<hi rend="italic">me!"</hi> 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0066" n="41"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"But didn't Lieders tell you I told him I 
would never take him back?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No, sir, no, Mr. Lossing, it was not that, it 
was you said it would be a cold day that you 
would take him back; and it was git so cold yesterday, 
 so I think, 'Now it would be a cold day 
to-morrow and Mr. Lossing he can take Kurt 
back.' And it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the most coldest day this 
year!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Lossing burst into a laugh, perhaps he was glad 
to have the Western sense of humor come to the 
rescue of his compassion. "Well, it was a cold 
day for you to come all this way for nothing," 
said he. "You go home and tell Lieders to 
report to-morrow." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Kurt's manner of receiving the news was characteristic. 
 He snorted in disgust: "Well, I did 
think he had more sand than to give in to a 
woman!" But after he heard the whole story he 
chuckled: "Yes, it was that way he said, and he 
must do like he said; but that was a funny way 
you done, Thekla. Say, mamma, yesterday, was 
you look out for the cat or to find how cold it 
been?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Never you mind, papa," said Thekla,"you remember  
what you promised if I git you back?" 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0067" n="42"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Lieders's eyes grew dull; he flung his arms out, 
with a long sigh. "No, I don't forget, I will keep 
my promise, but &mdash; it is like the handcuffs, Thekla, 
it is like the handcuffs!" In a second, however, 
he added, in a changed tone, "But thou art a 
kind jailer, mamma, more like a comrade. And 
no, it was not fair to thee &mdash; I know that now, 
Thekla."

<head>THE FACE OF FAILURE</head> 
 
<p> 
 
AFTER the week's shower the low Iowa hills 
looked vividly green. At the base of the 
first range of hills the Blackhawk road winds from 
the city to the prairie. From its starting-point, 
just outside the city limits, the wayfarer may 
catch bird's-eye glimpses of the city, the vast 
river that the Iowans love, and the three bridges 
tying three towns to the island arsenal. But at 
one's elbow spreads Cavendish's melon farm. 
Cavendish's melon farm it still is, in current 
phrase, although Cavendish, whose memory is 
honored by lovers of the cantaloupe melon, long 
ago departed to raise melons for larger markets; 
and still a weather-beaten sign creaks from a post 
announcing to the world that "the celebrated 
Cavendish Melons are for Sale here!" To-day 
the melon-vines were softly shaded by rain-drops. 
A pleasant sight they made, spreading for acres 
in front of the green-houses where mushrooms 
and early vegetables strove to outwit the seasons, 
and before the brown cottage in which Cavendish 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0069" n="44"/> 
 
had begun a successful career. The black roof-tree of the cottage sagged in the middle, and the 
weather-boarding was dingy with the streaky dinginess  
of old paint that has never had enough 
oil. The fences, too, were unpainted and rudely 
patched. Nevertheless a second glance told one 
that there were no gaps in them, that the farm 
machines kept their bright colors well under 
cover, and that the garden rows were beautifully 
straight and clean. An old white horse switched 
its sleek sides with its long tail and drooped its 
untrammelled neck in front of the gate. The 
wagon to which it was harnessed was new and 
had just been washed. Near the gate stood a girl 
and boy who seemed to be mutually studying 
each other's person. Decidedly the girl's slim, 
light figure in its dainty frock repaid one's eyes 
for their trouble; and her face, with its brilliant 
violet eyes, its full, soft chin, its curling auburn 
hair and delicate tints, was charming; but her 
brother's look was anything but approving. His 
lip curled and his small gray eyes grew smaller 
under his scowling brows. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Is <hi rend="italic">that</hi> your best suit?" said the girl. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, it is; and it's <hi rend="italic">going</hi> to be for one while," 
said the boy. 
 
</p> 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0070"/> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0071"/> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0072" n="47"/> 
 <p> 
It was a suit of the cotton mixture that looks 
like wool when it is new, and cuts a figure on 
the counters of every dealer in cheap ready-made 
clothing. It had been Tim Powell's best attire 
for a year; perhaps he had not been careful 
enough of it, and that was why it no longer cared 
even to imitate wool; it was faded to the hue of a 
clay bank, it was threadbare, the trousers bagged 
at the knees, the jacket bagged at the elbows, the 
pockets bulged flabbily from sheer force of habit, 
although there was nothing in them. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I thought you were to have a new suit," said 
the girl. "Uncle told me himself he was going to 
buy you one yesterday when you went to town." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I wouldn't have asked him to buy me anything  
yesterday for more'n a suit of clothes." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Why?" The girl opened her eyes. "Didn't 
he do anything with the lawyer? Is that why 
you are both so glum this morning?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No, he didn't. The lawyer says the woman 
that owns the mortgage has got to have the 
money. And it's due next week." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The girl grew pale all over her pretty rosy 
cheeks; her eyes filled with tears as she gasped, 
"Oh, how hateful of her, when she promised &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"She never promised nothing, Eve; it ain't 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0073" n="48"/> 
 
been hers for more than three months. Sloan, 
that used to have it, died, and left his property to 
be divided up between his nieces; and the mortgage  
is her share. See?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I don't care, it's just as mean. Mr. Sloan 
promised." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No, he didn't; he jest said if Uncle was behind  
he wouldn't press him; and he did let Uncle 
get behind with the interest two times and never 
kicked. But he died; and now the woman, she 
wants her money!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I think it is mean and cruel of her to turn us 
out! Uncle says mortgages are wicked anyhow, 
and I believe him!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I guess he couldn't have bought this place if 
he didn't give a mortgage on it. And he'd have 
had enough to pay cash, too, if Richards hadn't 
begged him so to lend it to him." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"When is Richards going to pay him?"  
</p> 
 
<p> 
"It come due three months ago; Richards 
ain't never paid up the interest even, and now 
he says he's got to have the mortgage extended 
for three years; anyhow for two." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"But don't he <hi rend="italic">know</hi> we've got to pay our own 
mortgage? How can we help <hi rend="italic">him?</hi> I wish 
Uncle would sell him out!" 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0074" n="49"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The boy gave her the superior smile of the 
masculine creature. "I suppose," he remarked 
with elaborate irony, "that he's like Uncle and 
you; he thinks mortgages are wicked." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"And just as like as not Uncle won't want 
to go to the carnival," Eve went on, her eyes 
filling again. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Tim gazed at her, scowling and sneering; but 
she was absorbed in dreams and hopes with which 
as yet his boyish mind had no point of contact. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"All the girls in the A class were going to go 
to see the fireworks together, and George Dean 
and some of the boys were going to take us, 
and we were going to have tea at May Arlington's  
house, and I was to stay all night;" &mdash; this 
came in a half sob. "I think it is just too 
mean! I never have any good times!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, yes, you do, sis, lots! Uncle always 
gits you everything you want. And he feels 
terrible bad when I &mdash; when he knows he can't 
afford to git something you want &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I know well enough who tells him we can't 
afford things!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, do you want us to git things we 
can't afford? I ain't never advised him except 
the best I knew how. I told him Richards 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0075" n="50"/> 
 
was a blow-hard, and I told him those Alliance 
grocery folks he bought such a lot of truck of 
would skin him, and they did; those canned 
things they sold him was all musty, and they 
said there wasn't any freight on 'em, and he 
had to pay freight and a fancy price besides; 
and I don't believe they had any more to do 
with the Alliance than our cow!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Uncle always believes everything. He 
always is so sure things are going to turn out 
just splendid; and they don't &mdash; only just middling; 
and then he loses a lot of money." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"But he is an awful good man," said the boy, 
musingly. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I don't believe in being so good you can't 
make money. I don't want always to be poor 
and despised, and have the other girls have 
prettier clothes than me!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I guess you can be pretty good and yet 
make money, if you are sharp enough. Of 
course you got to be sharper to be good and 
make money than you got to be, to be mean 
and make money." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, I know one thing, that Uncle ain't 
<hi rend="italic">ever</hi> going to make money. He &mdash;" The 
last word shrivelled on her lips, which puckered 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0076" n="51"/> 
 
into a confused smile at the warning frown of 
her brother. The man that they were discussing  
had come round to them past the hen-house. 
How much had he overheard? 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He didn't seem angry, anyhow. He called: 
"Well, Evy, ready?" and Eve was glad to run 
into the house for her hat without looking at 
him. It was a relief that she must sit on the 
back seat where she need not face Uncle Nelson. 
Tim sat in front; but Tim was so stupid he 
wouldn't mind. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Nor did he; it was Nelson Forrest that stole 
furtive glances at the lad's profile, the knitted 
brows, the freckled cheeks, the undecided nose, 
and firm mouth. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The boyish shoulders slouched forward at the 
same angle as that of the fifty-year-old shoulders 
beside him. Nelson, through long following of 
the plough, had lost the erect carriage painfully 
acquired in the army. He was a handsome man, 
whose fresh-colored skin gave him a perpetual 
appearance of having just washed his face. The 
features were long and delicate. The brown eyes 
had a liquid softness like the eyes of a woman. 
In general the countenance was alertly intelligent; 
he looked younger than his years; but this 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0077" n="52"/> 
 
afternoon the lines about his mouth and in his 
brows warranted every gray hair of his pointed 
short beard. There was a reason. Nelson was 
having one of those searing flashes of insight that 
do come occasionally to the most blindly hopeful 
souls. Nelson had hoped all his life. He hoped 
for himself, he hoped for the whole human race. 
He served the abstraction that he called <hi rend="italic">"Pro-</hi> 
gress" with unflinching and unquestioning loyalty. 
Every new scheme of increasing happiness 
by force found a helper, a fighter, and a giver in 
him; by turns he had been an Abolitionist, a 
Fourierist, a Socialist, a Greenbacker, a Farmers' 
Alliance man. Disappointment always was followed  
hard on its heels by a brand-new confidence. 
Progress ruled his farm as well as his 
politics; he bought the newest implements and 
subscribed trustfully to four agricultural papers; 
but being a born lover of the ground, a vein of 
saving doubt did assert itself sometimes in his 
work; and, on the whole, as a farmer he was 
successful. But his success never ventured outside  
his farm gates. At buying or selling, at a 
bargain in any form, the fourteen-year-old Tim 
was better than Nelson with his fifty years' experience  
of a wicked and bargaining world. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0078" n="53"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Was that any part of the reason, he wondered 
to-day, why at the end of thirty years of unflinching  
toil and honesty, he found himself with a vast 
budget of experience in the ruinous loaning of 
money, with a mortgage on the farm of a friend, 
and a mortgage on his own farm likely to be foreclosed? 
Perhaps it might have been better to 
stay in Henry County. He had paid for his farm 
at last. He had known a good moment, too, that 
day he drove away from the lawyer's with the 
cancelled mortgage in his pocket and Tim hopping  
up and down on the seat for joy. But the 
next day Richards &mdash; just to give him the chance 
of a good thing &mdash; had brought out that Maine 
man who wanted to buy him out. He was anxious  
to put the money down for the new farm, to 
have no whip-lash of debt forever whistling about 
his ears as he ploughed, ready to sting did he 
stumble in the furrows; and Tim was more anxious  
than he; but &mdash; there was Richards! Richards  
was a neighbor who thought as he did about 
Henry George and Spiritualism, and belonged to 
the Farmers' Alliance, and had lent Nelson all 
the works of Henry George that he (Richards) 
could borrow. Richards was in deep trouble. 
He had lost his wife; he might lose his farm. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0079" n="54"/> 
 
He appealed to Nelson, for the sake of old friendship, 
 to save him. And Nelson could not resist; 
so, two thousand of the thirty-four hundred dollars  
that the Maine man paid went to Richards, 
the latter swearing by all that is holy, to pay his 
friend off in full at the end of the year. There 
was money coming to him from his dead wife's 
estate, but it was tied up in the courts. Nelson 
would not listen to Tim's prophecies of evil. But 
he was a little dashed when Richards paid neither 
interest nor principal at the year's end, although 
he gave reasons of weight; and he experienced 
veritable consternation when the renewed mortgage  
ran its course and still Richards could not 
pay. The money from his wife's estate had been 
used to improve his farm (Nelson knew how rundown  
everything was), his new wife was sickly 
and "didn't seem to take hold," there had been 
a disastrous hail-storm &mdash; but why rehearse the 
calamities? they focussed on one sentence: it 
was impossible to pay. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Then Nelson, who had been restfully counting  
on the money from Richards for his own 
debt, bestirred himself, only to find his patient 
creditor gone and a woman in his stead who 
must have her money. He wrote again &mdash; 
 
</p> 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0080"/> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0081" n="56"/> 
 <p> 
 sorely against his will &mdash; begging Richards to raise 
the money somehow. Richards's answer was 
in his pocket, for he wore the best black broad-cloth in which he had done honor to the lawyer, 
 yesterday. Richards plainly was wounded; 
but he explained in detail to Nelson how he 
(Nelson) could borrow money of the banks on 
his farm and pay Miss Brown. There was no 
bank where Richards could borrow money; 
and he begged Nelson not to drive his wife 
and little children from their cherished home. 
Nelson choked over the pathos when he read 
the letter to Tim; but Tim only grunted a 
wish that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had the handling of that feller. 
And the lawyer was as little moved as Tim. 
Miss Brown needed the money, he said. The 
banks were not disposed to lend just at present; 
 money, it appeared, was "tight;" so, in 
the end, Nelson drove home with the face 
of Failure staring at him between his horses' 
ears. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
There was only one way. Should he make 
Richards suffer or suffer himself? Did a man 
have to grind other people or be ground himself? 
 Meanwhile they had reached the town. 
The stir of a festival was in the air. On every 
 
</p> 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0082"/> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0083" n="58"/> 
 
<p> 
 
side bunting streamed in the breeze or was 
draped across brick or wood. Arches spanned 
some of the streets, with inscriptions of welcome 
on them, and swarms of colored lanterns glittered  
against the sunlight almost as gayly as 
they would show when they should be lighted 
at night. Little children ran about waving 
flags. Grocery wagons and butchers' wagons 
trotted by with a flash of flags dangling from 
the horses' harness. The streets were filled 
with people in their holiday clothes. Everybody  
smiled. The shopkeepers answered questions  
and went out on the sidewalks to direct 
strangers. From one window hung a banner 
inviting visitors to enter and get a list of 
hotels and boarding-houses. The crowd was 
entirely good-humored and waited outside restaurants, 
 bandying jokes with true Western 
philosophy. At times the wagons made a 
temporary blockade in the street, but no one 
grumbled. Bands of music paraded past them, 
the escort for visitors of especial consideration. 
In a window belonging, the sign above declared, 
 to the Business Men's Association, 
stood a huge doll clad in blue satin, on which 
was painted a device of Neptune sailing down 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0084" n="59"/> 
 
the Mississippi amid a storm of fireworks. 
The doll stood in a boat arched about with 
lantern-decked hoops, and while Nelson halted, 
unable to proceed, he could hear the voluble 
explanation of the proud citizen who was interpreting  
to strangers. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
This, Nelson thought, was success. Here were 
the successful men. The man who had failed 
looked at them. Eve roused him by a shrill cry, 
"There they are. There's May and the girls. 
Let me out quick, Uncle!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He stopped the horse and jumped out himself 
to help her. It was the first time since she came 
under his roof that she had been away from it all 
night. He cleared his throat for some advice 
on behavior. "Mind and be respectful to Mrs. 
Arlington. Say yes, ma'am, and no, ma'am &mdash;" 
He got no further, for Eve gave him a hasty kiss 
and the crowd brushed her away. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"All she thinks of is wearing fine clothes and 
going with the fellers!" said her brother, disdainfully. 
 "If I had to be born a girl, I wouldn't 
be born at all!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Maybe if you despise girls so, you'll be born 
a girl the next time," said Nelson. "Some folks 
thinks that's how it happens with us." 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0085" n="60"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Do <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, Uncle?" asked Tim, running his 
mind forebodingly over the possible business 
results of such a belief. "S'posing he shouldn't 
be willing to sell the pigs to be killed, 'cause they 
might be some friends of his!" he reflected, with 
a rising tide of consternation. 
Nelson smiled rather sadly. He said, in another  
tone: "Tim, I've thought so many things, 
that now I've about given up thinking. All I 
can do is to live along the best way I know 
how and help the world move the best I'm 
able." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"You bet <hi rend="italic">I</hi> ain't going to help the world 
move," said the boy; "I'm going to look out for 
myself!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Then my training of you has turned out 
pretty badly, if that's the way you feel." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
A little shiver passed over the lad's sullen face; 
he flushed until he lost his freckles in the red 
veil and burst out passionately: "Well, I got 
eyes, ain't I? I ain't going to be bad, or drink, 
or steal, or do things to git put in the penitentiary; but  
I ain't going to let folks walk all over 
me like you do; no, sir!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Nelson did not answer; in his heart he thought 
that he had failed with the children, too; and he 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0086" n="61"/> 
 
relapsed into that dismal study of the face of 
Failure. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He had come to the city to show Tim the 
sights, and, therefore, though like a man in a 
dream, he drove conscientiously about the gay 
streets, pointing out whatever he thought might 
interest the boy, and generally discovering that 
Tim had the new information by heart already. 
All the while a question pounded itself, like the 
beat of the heart of an engine, through the noise 
and the talk: "Shall I give up Richards or be 
turned out myself?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
When the afternoon sunlight waned he put up 
the horse at a modest little stable where farmers 
were allowed to bring their own provender. The 
charges were of the smallest and the place neat 
and weather-tight, but it had been a long time 
before Nelson could be induced to use it, because 
there was a higher-priced stable kept by an exfarmer  
and member of the Farmers' Alliance. 
Only the fact that the keeper of the low-priced 
stable was a poor orphan girl, struggling to earn 
an honest livelihood, had moved him. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
They had supper at a restaurant of Tim's discovery, 
 small, specklessly tidy, and as unexacting 
of the pocket as the stable. It was an excellent 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0087" n="62"/> 
 
supper. But Nelson had no appetite; in spite of 
an almost childish capacity for being diverted, he 
could attend to nothing but the question always 
in his ears: "Richards or me &mdash; which?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Until it should be time for the spectacle they 
walked down the hill, and watched the crowds 
gradually blacken every inch of the river-banks. 
Already the swarms of lanterns were beginning 
to bloom out in the dusk. Strains of music 
throbbed through the air, adding a poignant 
touch to the excitement vibrating in all the faces 
and voices about them. Even the stolid Tim felt 
the contagion. He walked with a jaunty step 
and assaulted a tune himself. "I tell you, 
Uncle," says Tim, "it's nice of these folks to be 
getting up all this show, and giving it for nothing!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Do you think so?" says Nelson. "You don't 
love your book as I wish you did; but I guess 
you remember about the ancient Romans, and 
how the great, rich Romans used to spend enormous  
sums in games and shows that they let the 
people in free to &mdash; well, what for? Was it to 
learn them anything or to make them happy? 
Oh, no, it was to keep down the spirit of liberty, 
Son, it was to make them content to be slaves! 
 
</p> 
 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0088"/> 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0089" n="64"/> 
 
<p> 
 
And so it is here. These merchants and capitalists  
are only looking out for themselves, trying 
to keep labor down and not let it know how 
oppressed it is, trying to get people here from 
everywhere to show what a fine city they have 
and get their money." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, <hi rend="italic">'tis</hi> a fine town," Tim burst in, "a boss 
town! And they ain't gouging folks a little bit. 
None of the hotels or the restaurants have put 
up their prices one cent. Look what a dandy 
supper we got for twenty-five cents! And ain't 
the boy at Lumley's grocery given me two tickets 
to set on the steamboat? There's nothing mean 
about this town!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Nelson made no remark; but he thought, for 
the fiftieth time, that his farm was too near the 
city. Tim was picking up all the city boys' false 
pride as well as their slang. Unconscious Tim 
resumed his tune. He knew that it was "Annie 
Rooney" if no one else did, and he mangled the 
notes with appropriate exhilaration. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Now, the river was as busy as the land, lights 
swimming hither and thither; steamboats with 
ropes of tiny stars bespangling their dark bulk 
and a white electric glare in the bow, low boats 
with lights that sent wavering spear-heads into 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0090" n="65"/> 
 
the shadow beneath. The bridge was a blazing 
barbed fence of fire, and beyond the bridge, at 
the point of the island, lay a glittering multitude 
of lights, a fairy fleet with miniature sails outlined  
in flame as if by jewels. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Nelson followed Tim. The crowds, the ceaseless  
clatter of tongues and jar of wheels, depressed 
the man, who hardly knew which way to dodge 
the multitudinous perils of the thoroughfare; but 
Tim used his elbows to such good purpose that 
they were out of the levee, on the steamboat, and 
settling themselves in two comfortable chairs in 
a coign of vantage on deck, that commanded 
the best obtainable view of the pageant, before 
Nelson had gathered his wits together enough to 
plan a path out of the crush. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I sized up this place from the shore," Tim 
sighed complacently, drawing a long breath of 
relief; "only jest two chairs, so we won't be 
crowded." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Obediently, Nelson took his chair. His head 
sank on his thin chest. Richards or himself, 
which should he sacrifice? So the weary old 
question droned through his brain. He felt a 
tap on his shoulder. The man who roused him 
was an acquaintance, and he stood smiling in the 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0091" n="66"/> 
 
attitude of a man about to ask a favor, while the 
expectant half-smile of the lady on his arm 
hinted at the nature of the favor. Would Mr. 
Forrest be so kind? &mdash; there seemed to be no more 
seats. Before Mr. Forrest could be kind Tim 
had yielded his own chair and was off, wriggling 
among the crowd in search of another place. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Smart boy, that youngster of yours," said the 
man; "he'll make his way in the world, he can 
push. Well, Miss Alma, let me make you acquainted  
with Mr. Forrest. I know you will be 
well entertained by him. So, if you'll excuse 
me, I'll get back and help my wife wrestle with 
the kids. They have been trying to see which 
will fall overboard first ever since we came on 
deck!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Under the leeway of this pleasantry he bowed 
and retired. Nelson turned with determined 
politeness to the lady. He was sorry that she 
had come, she looking to him a very fine lady 
indeed, with her black silk gown, her shining 
black ornaments, and her bright black eyes. She 
was not young, but handsome in Nelson's judgment, 
 although of a haughty bearing. "Maybe 
she is the principal of the High School," thought 
he. "Martin has her for a boarder, and he said 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0092" n="67"/> 
 
she was very particular about her melons being 
cold!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
But however formidable a personage, the lady 
must be entertained. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I expect you are a resident of the city, 
ma'am?" said Nelson. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, I was born here." She smiled, a smile 
that revealed a little break in the curve of her 
cheek, not exactly a dimple, but like one. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I don't know when I have seen such a fine 
appearing lady," thought Nelson. He responded: 
 "Well, I wasn't born here; but I come when 
I was a little shaver of ten and stayed till I was 
eighteen, when I went to Kansas to help fight 
the border ruffians. I went to school here in the 
Warren Street school-house." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"So did I, as long as I went anywhere to 
school. I had to go to work when I was 
twelve." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Nelson's amazement took shape before his 
courtesy had a chance to control it. I didn't 
suppose you ever did any work in your life!" 
cried he. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I guess I haven't done much else. Father 
died when I was twelve and the oldest of five, 
the next only eight &mdash; Polly, that came between 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0093" n="68"/> 
 
Eb and me, died &mdash; naturally I had to work. I 
was a nurse-girl by the day, first; and I never 
shall forget how kind the woman was to me. 
She gave me so much dinner I never needed to 
eat any breakfast, which was a help." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"You poor little thing! I'm afraid you went 
hungry sometimes." Immediately he marvelled 
at his familiar speech, but she did not seem 
to resent it. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No, not so often," she said, musingly; "but I 
used often and often to wish I could carry some 
of the nice things home to mother and the babies. 
After a while she would give me a cookey or a 
piece of bread and butter for lunch; that I could 
take home. I don't suppose I'll often have more 
pleasure than I used to have then, seeing little Eb 
waiting for sister; and the baby and mother &mdash;" 
She stopped abruptly, to continue, in an instant, 
with a kind of laugh; "I am never likely to feel 
so important again as I did then, either. It was 
great to have mother consulting me, as if I had 
been grown up. I felt like I had the weight of 
the nation on my shoulders, I assure you." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"And have you always worked since? You 
are not working out now?" with a glance at her 
shining gown. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0094" n="69"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, no, not for a long time. I learned to be a 
cook. I was a good cook, too, if I say it myself. 
I worked for the Lossings for four years. I am 
not a bit ashamed of being a hired girl, for I was 
as good a one as I knew how. It was Mrs. 
Lossing that first lent me books; and Harry Lossing, 
 who is head of the firm now, got Ebenezer 
into the works. Ebenezer is shipping-clerk with a 
good salary and stock in the concern; and Ralph 
is there, learning the trade. I went to the business-college and learned book-keeping, and afterward  
I learned typewriting and shorthand. I 
have been working for the firm for fourteen years. 
We have educated the girls. Milly is married, 
and Kitty goes to the boarding-school, here." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Then you haven't been married yourself?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"What time did I have to think of being married? 
 I had the family on my mind, and looking 
after them." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"That was more fortunate for your family than 
it was for my sex," said Nelson, gallantly. He 
accompanied the compliment by a glance of admiration, 
 extinguished in an eye-flash, for the white 
radiance that had bathed the deck suddenly vanished. 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Now you will see a lovely sight," said the 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0095" n="70"/> 
 
woman, deigning no reply to his tribute; "listen! 
That is the signal." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The air was shaken with the boom of cannon. 
Once, twice, thrice. Directly the boat-whistles 
took up the roar, making a hideous din. The 
fleet had moved. Spouting rockets and Roman 
candles, which painted above it a kaleidoscopic 
archway of fire, welcomed by answering javelins 
of light and red and orange and blue and green 
flares from the shore; the fleet bombarded the 
bridge, escorted Neptune in his car, man&oelig;uvred 
and massed and charged on the blazing city 
with a many-hued shower of flame. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
After the boats, silently, softly, floated the battalions  
of lanterns, so close to the water that they 
seemed flaming water-lilies, while the dusky mirror  
repeated and inverted their splendor. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"They're shingles, you know," explained Nelson' 
s companion, "with lanterns on them; but 
aren't they pretty?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, they are! I wish you had not told me. 
It is like a fairy story!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Ain't it? But we aren't through; there's 
more to come. Beautiful fireworks!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The fireworks, however, were slow of coming. 
They could see the barge from which they were 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0096" n="71"/> 
 
to be sent; they could watch the movements 
of the men in white oil-cloth who moved in a 
ghostly fashion about the barge; they could hear 
the tap of hammers; but nothing came of it all. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
They sat in the darkness, waiting; and there 
came to Nelson a strange sensation of being alone 
and apart from all the breathing world with this 
woman. He did not perceive that Tim had 
quietly returned with a box which did very well 
for a seat, and was sitting with his knees against 
the chair-rungs. He seemed to be somehow outside  
of all the tumult and the spectacle. It was 
the vainglorying triumph of this world. He was 
the soul outside, the soul that had missed its triumph. 
 In his perplexity and loneliness he felt 
an overwhelming longing for sympathy; neither 
did it strike Nelson, who believed in all sorts of 
occult influences, that his confidence in a stranger 
was unwarranted. He would have told you that 
his "psychic instincts" never played him false, 
although really they were traitors from their 
astral cradles to their astral graves. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He said in a hesitating way: "You must 
excuse me being kinder dull; I've got some 
serious business on my mind and I can't help 
thinking of it." 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0097" n="72"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Is that so? Well, I know how that is; I 
have often stayed awake nights worrying about 
things. Lest I shouldn't suit and all that &mdash;  
especially  
after mother took sick." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I s'pose you had to give up and nurse her 
then?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"That was what Ebenezer and Ralph were for 
having me do; but mother &mdash; my mother always 
had so much sense &mdash; mother says, 'No, Alma, 
you've got a good place and a chance in life, you 
sha'n't give it up. We'll hire a girl. I ain't 
never lonesome except evenings, and then you 
will be home. I should jest want to die,' she 
says, 'if I thought I kept you in a kind of 
prison like by my being sick &mdash; now, just when 
you are getting on so well.' There never <hi rend="italic">was</hi> 
a woman like my mother!" Her voice shook 
a little, and Nelson asked gently: 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Ain't your mother living now?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No, she died last year." She added, after a 
little silence, "I somehow can't get used to being 
lonesome." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> hard," said Nelson. "I lost my wife 
three years ago." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"That's hard, too." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"My goodness! I guess it is. And it's hardest 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0098" n="73"/> 
 
when trouble comes on a man and he can't go 
nowhere for advice." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, that's so, too. But &mdash; have you any 
children?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, ma'am; that is, they ain't my own children. 
 Lizzie and I never had any; but these 
two we took and they are most like my own. 
The girl is eighteen and the boy rising of fourteen." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"They must be a comfort to you; but they are 
considerable of a responsibility, too." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, ma'am," he sighed softly to himself. 
"Sometimes I feel I haven't done the right way 
by them, though I've tried. Not that they ain't 
good children, for they are &mdash; no better anywhere. 
Tim, he will work from morning till night, and 
never need to urge him; and he never gives me 
a promise he don't keep it, no ma'am, never did 
since he was a little mite of a lad. And he is a 
kind boy, too, always good to the beasts; and 
while he may speak up a little short to his sister, 
he saves her many a step. He doesn't take to 
his studies quite as I would like to have him, but 
he has a wonderful head for business. There is 
splendid stuff in Tim if it could only be worked 
right." 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0099" n="74"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
While Nelson spoke, Tim was hunching his 
shoulders forward in the darkness, listening with 
the whole of two sharp ears. His face worked in 
spite of him, and he gave an inarticulate snort. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well," the woman said, "I think that speaks 
well for Tim. Why should you be worried about 
him?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I am afraid he is getting to love money and 
worldly success too well, and that is what I fear 
for the girl, too. You see, she is so pretty, and 
the idols of the tribe and the market, as Bacon 
calls them, are strong with the young." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, that's so," the woman assented vaguely, 
not at all sure what either Bacon or his idols 
might be. "Are the children relations of 
yours?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No, ma'am; it was like this: When I was up 
in Henry County there came a photographic artist  
to the village near us, and pitched his tent 
and took tintypes in his wagon. He had his 
wife and his two children with him. The poor 
woman fell ill and died; so we took the two 
children. My wife was willing; she was a wonderfully  
good woman, member of the Methodist 
church till she died. I &mdash; I am not a church member  
myself, ma'am; I passed through that stage 
 
</p> 
 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0100"/> 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0101" n="76"/> 
 
<p> 
 
of spiritual development a long while ago." He 
gave a wistful glance at his companion's dimly 
outlined profile. "But I never tried to disturb 
her faith; it made <hi rend="italic">her</hi> happy." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, I don't think it is any good fooling with 
other people's religions," said the woman, easily. 
"It is just like trying to talk folks out of drinking; 
 nobody knows what is right for anybody 
else's soul any more than they do what is good 
for anybody else's stomach!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, ma'am. You put things very clearly." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I guess it is because you understand so 
quickly. But you were saying &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"That's all the story. We took the children, 
and their father was killed by the cars the next 
year, poor man; and so we have done the best we 
could ever since by them." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I should say you had done very well by 
them." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No, ma'am; I haven't done very well somehow  
by anyone, myself included, though God 
knows I've tried hard enough!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Then followed the silence natural after such a 
confession when the listener does not know the 
speaker well enough to parry abasement by 
denial. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0102" n="77"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I am impressed," said Nelson, simply, "to 
talk with you frankly. It isn't polite to bother 
strangers with your troubles, but I am impressed 
that you won't mind." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, no, I won't mind." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
It was not extravagant sympathy; but Nelson 
thought how kind her voice sounded, and what a 
musical voice it was. Most people would have 
called it rather sharp. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He told her &mdash; with surprisingly little egotism, 
as the keen listener noted &mdash; the story of his life; 
the struggle of his boyhood; his random self-education; 
 his years in the army (he had criticised 
his superior officers, thereby losing the promotion 
that was coming for bravery in the field); his marriage  
(apparently he had married his wife because 
another man had jilted her); his wrestle with 
nature (whose pranks included a cyclone) on a 
frontier farm that he eventually lost, having put 
all his savings into a "Greenback" newspaper, 
and being thus swamped with debt; his final slow 
success in paying for his Iowa farm; and his purchase  
of the new farm, with its resulting disaster. 
"I've farmed in Kansas," he said, "in Nebraska, 
in Dakota, in Iowa. I was willing to go wherever 
the land promised. It always seemed like I was 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0103" n="78"/> 
 
going to succeed, but somehow I never did. The 
world ain't fixed right for the workers, I take it. 
A man who has spent thirty years in hard, honest 
toil oughtn't to be staring ruin in the face like I 
am to-day. They won't let it be so when we have 
the single tax and when we farmers send our own 
men instead of city lawyers, to the Legislature 
and halls of Congress. Sometimes I think it's 
the world that's wrong and sometimes I think it's 
me!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The reply came in crisp and assured accents, 
which were the strongest contrast to Nelson's 
soft, undecided pipe: "Seems to me in this last 
case the one most to blame is neither you nor the 
world at large, but this man Richards, who is asking  
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> to pay for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> farm. And I notice you 
don't seem to consider your creditor in this business. 
 How do you know she don't need the 
money? Look at me, for instance; I'm in some 
financial difficulty myself. I have a mortgage for 
two thousand dollars, and that mortgage &mdash; for 
which good value was given, mind you &mdash; falls due 
this month. I want the money. I want it bad. 
I have a chance to put my money into stock at 
the factory. I know all about the investment; 
I haven't worked there all these years and not 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0104" n="79"/> 
 
know how the business stands. It is a chance 
to make a fortune. I ain't likely to ever have 
another like it; and it won't wait for me to make 
up my mind forever, either. Isn't it hard on me, 
too?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Lord knows it is, ma'am," said Nelson, despondently; 
 "it is hard on us all! Sometimes I 
don't see the end of it all. A vast social revolution  
&mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Social fiddlesticks! I beg your pardon, Mr. 
Forrest, but it puts me out of patience to have 
people expecting to be allowed to make every 
mortal kind of fools of themselves and then have 
'a social revolution' jump in to slue off the consequences. 
 Let us understand each other. Who 
do you suppose I am?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Miss &mdash; Miss Almer, ain't it?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"It's Alma Brown, Mr. Forrest. I saw you 
coming on the boat and I made Mr. Martin fetch 
me over to you. I told him not to say my name, 
because I wanted a good plain talk with you. 
Well, I've had it. Things are just about where 
I thought they were, and I told Mr. Lossing so. 
But I couldn't be sure. You must have thought 
me a funny kind of woman to be telling you all 
those things about myself." 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0105" n="80"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Nelson, who had changed color half a dozen 
times in the darkness, sighed before he said: 
"No, ma'am; I only thought how good you were 
to tell me. I hoped maybe you were impressed 
to trust me as I was to trust you." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Being so dark Nelson could not see the queer 
expression on her face as she slowly shook her 
head. She was thinking: "If I ever saw a babe 
in arms trying to do business! How did <hi rend="italic">he</hi> ever 
pay for a farm?" She said: "Well, I did it on 
purpose; I wanted you to know I wasn't a cruel 
aristocrat, but a woman that had worked as hard 
as yourself. Now, why shouldn't you help me 
and yourself instead of helping Richards? You 
have confidence in me, you say. Well, show it. 
I'll give you your mortgage for your mortgage on 
Richards's farm. Come, can't you trust Richards 
to me? You think it over." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The hiss of a rocket hurled her words into 
space. The fireworks had begun. Miss Brown 
looked at them and watched Nelson at the same 
time. As a good business woman who was also 
a good citizen, having subscribed five dollars to 
the carnival, she did not propose to lose the 
worth of her money; neither did she intend to 
lose a chance to do business. Perhaps there was 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0106" n="81"/> 
 
an obscurer and more complex motive lurking in 
some stray corner of that queer garret, a woman's 
mind. Such motives &mdash; aimless softenings of the 
heart, unprofitable diversions of the fancy &mdash; will 
seep unconsciously through the toughest business 
principles of woman. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
She was puzzled by the look of exaltation 
on Nelson's features, illumined as they were by 
the uncanny light. If the fool man had not forgotten  
all his troubles just to see a few fire-works! No, he was not that kind of a fool; 
maybe &mdash; and she almost laughed aloud in her 
pleasure over her own insight &mdash; maybe it all 
made him think of the war, where he had been 
so brave. "He was a regular hero in the war," 
Miss Brown concluded, "and he certainly is a 
perfect gentleman; what a pity he hasn't got 
any sense!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
She had guessed aright, although she had not 
guessed deep enough in regard to Nelson. He 
watched the great wheels of light, he watched 
the river aflame with Greek fire, then, with a 
shiver, he watched the bombs bursting into 
myriads of flowers, into fizzing snakes, into fields 
of burning gold, into showers of jewels that made 
the night splendid for a second and faded. They 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0107" n="82"/> 
 
were not fireworks to him; they were a magical  
phantasmagoria that renewed the incoherent 
and violent emotions of his youth; again he was 
in the chaos of the battle, or he was dreaming by 
his camp-fire, or he was pacing his lonely round 
on guard. His heart leaped again with the old 
glow, the wonderful, beautiful worship of Liberty 
that can do no wrong. He seemed to hear a 
thousand voices chanting: 
 
"In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea, 
 As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free!" 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
His turbid musings cleared &mdash; or they seemed 
to him to clear &mdash; under the strong reaction of 
his imagination and his memories. It was all 
over, the dream and the glory thereof. The 
splendid young soldier was an elderly, ruined 
man. But one thing was left: he could be true 
to his flag. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"A poor soldier, but enlisted for the war," says 
Nelson, squaring his shoulders, with a lump in his 
throat and his eyes brimming. "I know by the 
way it hurts me to think of refusing her that it's 
a temptation to wrong-doing. No, I can't save 
myself by sacrificing a brother soldier for humanity. 
 She is just as kind as she can be, but 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0108" n="83"/> 
 
women don't understand business; she wouldn't 
make allowance for Richards." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He felt a hand on his shoulder; it was Martin 
apologizing for hurrying Miss Brown; but the 
baby was fretting and &mdash; 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I'm sorry &mdash; yes &mdash; well, I wish you didn't have 
to go!" Nelson began; but a hoarse treble rose 
from under his elbows: "Say, Mr. Martin, Uncle 
and me can take Miss Brown home." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"If you will allow me the pleasure," said Nelson, 
 with the touch of courtliness that showed 
through his homespun ways. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> like to see the hundred bombs 
bursting at once and Vulcan at his forge!" said 
Miss Brown. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Thus the matter arranged itself. Tim waited 
with the lady while Nelson went for the horse, 
nor was it until afterward that Miss Brown 
wondered why the lad did not go instead of the 
man. But Tim had his own reasons. No sooner 
was Nelson out of earshot than he began: "Say, 
Miss Brown, I can tell you something." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"That Richards is no good; but you can't get 
Uncle to see it. At least it will take time. If 
you'll help me we can get him round in time. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0109" n="84"/> 
 
Won't you please not sell us out for six months 
and give me a show? I'll see you get your interest  
and your money, too." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"You?" Miss Brown involuntarily took a 
business attitude, with her arms akimbo, and 
eyed the boy. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, ma'am, me. I ain't so very old, but I 
know all about the business. I got all the figures 
down &mdash; how much we raise and what we got last 
year. I can fetch them to you so you can see. 
He is a good farmer, and he will catch on to the 
melons pretty quick. We'll do better next year, 
and I'll try to keep him from belonging to things 
and spending money; and if he won't lend to 
anybody or start in raising a new kind of crop 
just when we get the melons going, he will make 
money sure. He is awful good and honest. All 
the trouble with him is he needs somebody to 
take care of him. If Aunt Lizzie had been alive 
he never would have lent that dead-beat Richards 
that money. He ought to get married." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Miss Brown did not feel called on to say anything. 
 Tim continued in a judicial way: "He is 
awful good and kind, always gets up in the morning  
to make the fire if I have got something else 
to do; and he'd think everything his wife did was 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0110" n="85"/> 
 
the best in the world; and if he had somebody 
to take care of him he'd make money. I don't 
suppose <hi rend="italic">you</hi> 
 
</p> 
 

 
<p> 
 
would think 
of it?" This 
last in an 
insinuating 
tone, with 
evident anxiety. 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, I 
never!" said 
Miss Brown. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Whether 
she was more 
offended or 
amused she 
couldn't 
tell; and she 
stood staring  
at him 
by the electric  
light. 
To her amazement the hard little face began to 
twitch. "I didn't mean to mad you," Tim 
grunted, with a quiver in his rough voice. "I've 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0111" n="86"/> 
 
been listening to every word you said, and I 
thought you were so sensible you'd talk over 
things without nonsense. Of course I knew he'd 
have to come and see you Saturday nights, and 
take you buggy riding, and take you to the theatre, 
 and all such things &mdash; first. But I thought we 
could sorter fix it up between ourselves. I've 
taken care of him ever since Aunt Lizzie died, 
and I did my best he shouldn't lend that money, 
but I couldn't help it; and I did keep him from 
marrying a widow woman with eight children, 
who kept telling him how much her poor 
fatherless children needed a man; and I never 
did see anybody I was willing &mdash; before &mdash; and 
it's &mdash; it's so lonesome without Aunt Lizzie!" 
He choked and frowned. Poor Tim, who had 
sold so many melons to women and seen so 
much of back doors and kitchen humors that 
he held the sex very cheap, he did not realize 
how hard he would find it to talk of the one 
woman who had been kind to him! He 
turned red with shame over his own weakness. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"You poor little chap!" cried Miss Brown; 
"you poor little sharp, innocent chap!" The 
hand she laid on his shoulder patted it as she 
went on: "Never mind, if I can't marry your 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0112" n="87"/> 
 
uncle, I can help you take care of him. 
You're a real nice boy, and I'm not mad; don't 
you think it. There's your uncle now." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Nelson found her so gentle that he began to 
have qualms lest his carefully prepared speech 
should hurt her feelings. But there was no 
help for it now. "I have thought over your 
kind offer to me, ma'am," said he, humbly, 
"and I got a proposition to make to you. It 
is your honest due to have your farm, yes, 
ma'am. Well, I know a man would like to 
buy it; I'll sell it to him, and pay you your 
money." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"But that wasn't my proposal." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I know it, ma'am. I honor you for your 
kindness; but I can't risk what &mdash; what might be 
another person's idea of duty about Richards. 
Our consciences ain't all equally enlightened, 
you know." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Miss Brown did not answer a word. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
They drove along the streets where the 
lanterns were fading. Tim grew uneasy, she 
was silent so long. On the brow of the hill 
she indicated a side street and told them to 
stop the horse before a little brown house. 
One of the windows was a dim square of red. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0113" n="88"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"It isn't quite so lonesome coming home to 
a light," said Miss Brown. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
As Nelson cramped the wheel to jump out 
to help her from the vehicle, the light from 
the electric arc fell full on his handsome face 
and showed her the look of compassion and 
admiration, there. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Wait one moment," she said, detaining him 
with one firm hand. "I've got something to 
say to you. Let Richards go for the present; 
all I ask of you about him is that you will do 
nothing until we can find out if he is so bad off. 
But, Mr. Forrest, I can do better for you about 
that mortgage. Mr. Lossing will take it for 
three years for a relative of his and pay me the 
money. I told him the story." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"And <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will get the money all right?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Just the same. I was only trying to help 
you a little by the other way, and I failed. 
Never mind." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I can't tell you how you make me feel," 
said Nelson. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Please let him bring you some melons 
to-morrow and make a stagger at it, though," 
said Tim. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Can I?" Nelson's eyes shone. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0114" n="89"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"If you want to," said Miss Brown. She 
laughed; but in a moment she smiled. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
All the way home Nelson saw the same face 
of Failure between the old mare's white ears; 
but its grim lineaments were softened by a 
smile, a smile like Miss Brown's.

<head>TOMMY AND THOMAS</head> 
 
<p> 
IT was while Harry Lossing was at the High 
School that Mrs. Carriswood first saw Tommy 
Fitzmaurice. He was not much to see, a long lad 
of sixteen who had outgrown his jackets and was 
not yet grown to his ears. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
At this period Mrs. Fitzmaurice was his barber, 
 and she, having been too rash with the 
shears in one place, had snipped off the rest 
of his curly black locks "to match;" until he 
showed a perfect convict's poll, giving his ears 
all the better chance, and bringing out the 
rather square contour of his jaws to advantage. 
He had the true Irish-Norman face; a skin 
of fine texture, fair and freckled, high cheek-bones, 
 straight nose, and wide blue eyes that 
looked to be drawn with ink, because of their 
sharply pencilled brows and long, thick, black 
lashes. But the feature that Mrs. Carriswood 
noticed was Tommy's mouth, a flexible and 
 
</p> 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0116" n="91"/> 
 

 
<p> 
 
delicately cut mouth, of which the lips moved 
lightly in speaking and seldom were quite in 
repose. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0117" n="92"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"The genuine Irish orator's mouth," thought 
Mrs. Carriswood. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Tommy, however, was not a finished orator, 
and Mrs. Carriswood herself deigned to help him 
with his graduating oration; Tommy delivering 
the aforesaid oration from memory, on the stage 
of the Grand Opera House, to a warm-hearted 
and perspiring audience of his towns-people, amid 
tremendous applause and not the slightest proddings  
of conscience. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Really the speech deserved the applause; Mrs. 
Carriswood, who had heard half the eloquence of 
the world, spent three evenings on it; and she 
has a good memory. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Her part in the affair always amused her; 
though, in fact, it came to pass easily. She had 
the great fortune of the family. Being a widow 
with no children, and the time not being come 
when philanthropy beckons on the right hand 
and on the left to free-handed women, Mrs. Carriswood  
travelled. As she expressed it, she was 
searching the globe for a perfect climate. "Not 
that I in the least expect to find it," said she, 
cheerfully, "but I like to vary my disappointments; 
 when I get worn out being frozen, winters, 
 I go somewhere to be soaked." She was on 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0118" n="93"/> 
 
her way to California this time, with her English 
maid, who gave the Lossing domestics many a 
jolly moment by her inextinguishable panic about 
red Indians. Mrs. Derry supposed these savages 
to be lurking on the prairie outside every Western  
town; and almost fainted when she did 
 
</p> 
 

 
<p> 
 
chance to turn the corner upon three Kickapoo 
Indians, splendid in paint and feathers, and 
peacefully vending the "Famous Kickapoo Sagwa. 
" She had others of the artless notions of 
the travelling English, and I fear that they were 
encouraged not only by the cook, the "second 
girl," and the man-of-all-work, but by Harry and 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0119" n="94"/> 
 
his chum, Tommy; I know she used to tell how 
she saw tame buffalo "roosting" on the streets, 
"w'ich they do look that like common cows a 
body couldn't tell 'em hapart!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
She had a great opinion of Tommy, a mystery 
to her mistress for a long time, until one day it 
leaked out that Tommy "and Master Harry, 
too," had told her that Tommy's great-grandfather  
was a lord in the old country. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"The family seem to have sunk in the world 
since, Derry," was Mrs. Carriswood's single remark, 
 as she smiled to herself. After Derry was 
dismissed she picked up a letter, written that day 
to a friend of hers, and read some passages about 
Harry and Tommy, smiling again. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Harry" &mdash; one may look over her pretty 
shoulder without impertinence, in a story &mdash;  
"Harry, 
" she wrote, "is a boy that I long to 
steal. Just the kind of boy we have both 
wanted, Sarah &mdash; frank, happy, affectionate. I 
must tell you something about him. It came 
out by accident. He has the Western business 
instincts, and what do you suppose he did? He 
actually started a wee shop of his own in the 
corner of the yard (really it is a surprisingly 
pretty place, and they are quite civilized in the 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0120" n="95"/> 
 
house, gas, hot water, steam heat, all most comfortable),  
and sold 'pop' and candy and cakes to 
the boys. He made so much money that he proposed  
a partnership to the cook and the setting 
up a little booth in the 'county fair,' which is like 
our rural cattle shows, you know. The cook (a 
superior person who borrows books from Mrs. 
Lossing, but seems very decent and respectful 
notwithstanding, and broils game to perfection. 
And <hi rend="italic">such</hi> game as we have here, Sarah !) &mdash; well, 
the cook made him cream-cakes, sandwiches, 
tarts, and candy, and Harry honorably bought all 
the provisions with his profits from the first 
venture. You will open your eyes at his father 
permitting such a thing, but Henry Lossing is a 
thorough Westerner in some ways, and he looks 
on it all as a joke. 'Might show the boy how to 
do business,' he says. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, they had a ravishing display, so Alma, 
the cook, and William, the man, assured me &mdash; per 
Derry. All the sadder its fate; for alas! a gang 
of rowdy boys fell upon Harry, and while he was 
busy fighting half of them &mdash; he is as plucky as 
his uncle, the general &mdash; the other half looted the 
beautiful stock in trade! They would have despoiled  
our poor little merchant entirely but for 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0121" n="96"/> 
 
the opportune arrival of a schoolmate who is 
mightily respected by the rowdies. He knocked 
one of them down and shouted after the others 
that he would give every one of them a good 
thrashing if they did not bring the plunder back; 
and as he is known to be a lad of his word for 
good or evil, actually the scamps did return most 
of the booty, which the two boys brushed off and 
sold, as far as it went (!) The consequence of the 
fray has been that Harry is unboundedly grateful 
to this Tommy Fitzmaurice, and is at present 
coaching him on his graduating oration. Fitzmaurice  
has studied hard and won honors, and 
wants to make a show with his oration, to please 
his father. 'You see,' says Harry, 'Tommy's 
father has saved money and is spending it all on 
Tommy, so's he can be educated. He needs 
Tommy in the business real bad, but he won't 
let him come in; he keeps him at school, and he 
thinks everything of his getting the valedictory, 
and Tommy, he worked nights studying to get it.' 
When I asked what was the father's business, 
Harry grew a bit confused. 'Well, he kept a 
saloon; but' &mdash; Harry hastened to explain &mdash; 'it 
was a very nice saloon, never any trouble with the 
police there; why, Tommy knew every man on 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0122" n="97"/> 
 
the force. And they keep good liquors, too,' said 
Harry, earnestly; 'throw away all the beer left in 
the glasses.' 'What else would they do with it?' 
asked innocent I. 'Why, keep it in a bucket,' 
said Harry, solemnly, 'and then slip the glass 
under the counter and half fill out of the bucket, 
then hold it under the keg <hi rend="italic">low</hi>, so's the foam will 
come; that's a trick of the trade, you know. 
Tommy says his father would <hi rend="italic">scorn</hi> that!' There 
is a vista opened, isn't there? I was rather 
shocked at such associates for Harry, and told 
his mother. Did she think it a good idea to 
have such a boy coming to the house? a saloon-keeper' 
s son? She did not laugh, as I half expected, 
 but answered quite seriously that she had 
been looking up Tommy, that he was very much 
attached to Harry, and that she did not think he 
would teach him anything bad. He has, I find 
myself, notions of honor, though they are rather 
the code of the street. And he picks up things 
quickly. Once he came to tea. It was amusing 
to see how he glued his eyes on Harry and kept 
time with his motions. He used his fork quite 
properly, only as Harry is a left-handed little 
fellow, the right-handed Thomas had the more 
difficulty. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0123" n="98"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"He is taking such vast pains with his 'oration' 
that I felt moved to help him. The subject is 
'The Triumph of Democracy,' and Tommy civilly 
explained that 'democracy' did not mean the 
Democratic party, but 'just only a government 
where all the poor folks can get their rights and 
can vote.' 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"The oration was the kind of spread-eagle 
thing you might expect; I can see that Tommy 
has formed himself on the orators of his father's 
respectable saloon. What he said in comment 
interested me more. 'Sure, I guess it is the best 
government, ma'am, though, of course, I got to 
make it out that way, anyhow. But we come 
from Ireland, and there they got the other kind, 
and me granny, she starved in the famine time, 
she did that &mdash; with the fever. Me father walked 
twenty mile to the Sackville's place, where they 
gave him some meal, though he wasn't one of 
their tenants; yes, and the lady told him how he 
would be cooking it. I never will forget that 
lady!' 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I saw a dramatic opportunity: would Tommy 
be willing to tell that story in his speech? He 
looked at me with an odd look &mdash; or so I imagined 
it! 'Why not?' says he; 'I'd as soon as not tell 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0124" n="99"/> 
 
it to anyone of them, and why not to them all 
together?' Well, why not, when you come to 
think of it? So we have got it into the speech; 
and I, I myself, Sarah, am drilling young Demosthenes, 
 and he is so apt a scholar that I find 
myself rather pleasantly employed." Having read 
her letter, Mrs. Carriswood hesitated a second 
and then added Derry's information at the bottom  
of the page. "I suppose the lordly ancestor 
was one of King James's creation &mdash; see Macaulay, 
somewhere in the second volume. I dare say 
there is a drop or two of good blood in the boy. 
He has the manners of a gentleman &mdash; but I don't 
know that I ever saw an Irishman, no matter how 
low in the social scale, who hadn't." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Thus it happened that Tommy's valedictory 
scored a success that is a tradition of the High 
School, and came to be printed in both the city 
papers; copies of which journals Tommy's mother 
has preserved sacredly to this day; and I have no 
doubt, could one find them, they would be found 
wrapped around a yellow photograph of the "A 
Class" of 1870: eight pretty girls in white, smiling  
among five solemn boys in black, and Tommy 
himself, as the valedictorian, occupying the centre 
of the picture in his new suit of broadcloth, with 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0125" n="100"/> 
 
a rose in his buttonhole and his hair cut by a professional  
barber for the occasion. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
It was the story of the famine that really captured 
 
</p> 
 

 
<p> 
 
the audience; and Tommy told it well, 
with the true Irish fire, in a beautiful voice. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
In the front seat of the parquette a little old 
man in a wrinkled black broadcloth, with a bald 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0126" n="101"/> 
 
head and a fringe of whisker under his long chin, 
and a meek little woman, in a red Paisley shawl, 
wept and laughed by turns. They had taken the 
deepest interest in every essay and every speech. 
The old man clapped his large hands (which were 
encased in loose, black kid gloves) with unflagging 
vigor. He wore a pair of heavy boots, the soles 
of which made a noble thud on the floor. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Ain't it wonderful the like of them young 
craters can talk like that!" he cried; "shure, 
Molly, that young lady who'd the essay &mdash; where is 
it?" &mdash; a huge black forefinger travelled down the 
page &mdash;" '<hi rend="italic">Music, The Turkish Patrol</hi>,' No &mdash; though 
that's grand, that piece; I'll be spakin' wid Professor  
Von Keinmitz to bring it when we've the 
opening. Here 'tis, Molly: '<hi rend="italic">Tin, Essay. The 
Darkest Night Brings Out the Stars, Miss Mamie 
Odenheimer</hi>.' Thrue for you, mavourneen! And 
the sintiments, wasn't they illigant? and the langwidge  
was as foine as Pat Ronan's speeches or 
Father &mdash; whist! will ye look at the flowers that 
shlip of a gyirl's gitting! Count 'em, will 
ye?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Fourteen bouquets and wan basket," says the 
little woman, "and Mamie Odenheimer, she got 
seventeen bouquets and two baskets and a sign. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0127" n="102"/> 
 
Well," she looked anxious, but smiled, "I know 
of siven bouquets Tommy will git for sure. And 
that's not countin' what Harry Lossing will do 
for him. Hiven bless the good heart of him!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, I kin count four for him on wan seat," 
says the man, with a nod of his head toward the 
gay heap in the woman's lap, "barrin' I ain't onvaygled  
into flinging some of thim to the young 
ladies!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Harry Lossing, in the seat behind with his 
mother and Mrs. Carriswood, giggled at this and 
whispered in the latter lady's ear, "That's Tommy's  
father and mother. My, aren't they excited, 
though! And Tommy's white's a sheet &mdash; for fear 
he'll disappoint them, you know. He has said 
his piece over twice to me, to-day, he's so scared 
lest he'll forget. I've got it in my pocket, and 
I'm going behind when it's his turn, to prompt 
him. Did you see me winking at him? it sort of 
cheers him up." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He was almost as keen over the floral procession  
as the Fitzmaurices themselves. The Lossing  
garden had been stripped to the last bud, and 
levies made on the asparagus-bed, into the bargain, 
 and Mrs. Lossing and Alma and Mrs. Carriswood  
and Derry and Susy Lossing had made 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0128" n="103"/> 
 
bouquets and baskets and wreaths, and Harry 
had distributed them among friends in different 
parts of the house. I say Harry, but, complimented  
by Mrs. Carriswood, he admitted ingenuously  
that it was Tommy's idea. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Tommy thought they would make more show 
that way," says Harry, "and they are all on the 
middle aisle, so his father and mother can see 
them; Tim O'Halloran has got one for him, too, 
and Mrs. Macillarney, and she's got some splendid  
pinies. Picked every last one. They'll make 
a show!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
But Harry knew nothing of the most magnificent  
of his friend's trophies until it undulated 
gloriously down the aisle, above the heads of 
two men, white satin ribbons flying, tinfoil shining  
&mdash; an enormous horseshoe of roses and mignonette! 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The parents were both on their feet to crane 
their necks after it, as it passed them amid the 
plaudits. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, it was <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, Cousin Margaret; I know it 
was you," cried Harry. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He took the ladies over to the Fitzmaurices 
the minute that the diplomas were given; and, 
directly, Tommy joined them, attended by two 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0129" n="104"/> 
 
admiring followers laden with the trophies. Mrs. 
O'Halloran and Mrs. Macillarney and divers of 
the friends, both male and female, joined the 
circle. Tommy held quite a little court. He 
shook hands with all the ladies, beginning with 
Mrs. Carriswood (who certainly never had found 
herself before in such a company, jammed between  
Alderman McGinnis's resplendent new 
tweeds and Mrs. Macillarney's calico); he affectionately  
embraced his mother, and he allowed 
himself to be embraced by Mrs. Macillarney and 
Mrs. O'Halloran, while Patrick Fitzmaurice shook 
hands with the alderman. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Here's the lady that helped me on me piece, 
father; she's the lady that sent me the horse-shoe, 
 mother. Like to make you acquainted with 
me father and me mother. Mr. and Mrs. Fitzmaurice, 
 Mrs. Carriswood." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
In these words, Tommy, blushing and happy, 
presented his happy parents. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Sure, I'm proud to meet you, ma'am," said 
Fitzmaurice, bowing, while his wife courtesied 
and wiped her eyes. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
They were very grateful, but they were more 
grateful for the flowers than for the oratorical 
drilling. No doubt they thought that their 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0130" n="105"/> 
 
Tommy could have done as well in any case; 
but the splendid horseshoe was another matter! 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Ten years passed before Mrs. Carriswood saw 
her pupil again. During those years the town 
had increased and prospered; so had the Lossing 
Art Furniture Works. It was after Harry Lossing 
had disappointed his father. This is not saying 
that he had done anything out of the way; he 
had simply declined to be the fourth Harry Lossing  
on the rolls of Harvard College. Instead, he 
proposed to enter the business and to begin by 
learning his own trade. He was so industrious, 
he kept at it with such energy that his first 
convert was his father &mdash; no, I am wrong, Mrs. 
Carriswood was the first; Mrs. Lossing was not 
a convert, <hi rend="italic">she</hi> had believed in Harry from the 
beginning. But all this was years before Mrs. 
Carriswood's visit. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Another of Master Harry's notions was his 
belief in the necessity of his "meddling" &mdash; so his 
father put it &mdash; in the affairs of the town, the state, 
and the nation, as well as those of the Lossing 
furniture company. But, though he was pleased 
to make rather cynical fun of his son's political 
enthusiasm, esteeming it in a sense a diverting 
and therefore reprehensible pursuit for a business 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0131" n="106"/> 
 
man, the elder Lossing had a sneaking pride in it, 
all the same. He liked to bring out Harry's 
political shrewdness. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Fancy, Margaret," says he, "whom do you 
think Harry has brought over to our side now? 
The shrewdest ward politician in the town &mdash; why, 
you saw him when he was a boy &mdash; Tommy Fitzmaurice." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Then Mrs. Carriswood remembered; she asked, 
amused, how was Tommy and where was he? 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Tommy? Oh, he went to the State university; 
 the old man was bound to send him, and he 
was more dutiful than some sons. He was graduated  
with honors, and came back to a large, 
ready-made justice court's practice. Of course he 
drifted into criminal practice; but he has made a 
fine income out of that, and is the shrewdest, 
some folks say the least scrupulous, political 
manager in the county. And so, Harry, you 
have persuaded him to cast in his lot with the 
party of principle, have you? and he is packing 
the primaries?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I see nothing dishonest in our trying to 
get our friends out to vote at the primaries, 
sir." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Of course not, but he may not stop there. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0132" n="107"/> 
 
However, I want Bailey elected, and I am glad he 
will work for us; what's his price?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Harry blushed a little. "I believe he would 
like to be city attorney, sir," said he; and Mr. 
Lossing laughed. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Would he make a bad one?" asked Mrs. Carriswood. 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"He would make the best kind of a one," 
replied Harry, with youthful fervor; "he's a 
ward politician and all that, I know; but he has 
it in him to be an uncommon deal more! And I 
say, sir, do you know that he and the old man 
will take twenty-five thousand of the stock at par 
if we turn ourselves into a corporation?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"How about this new license measure? won't 
that bear a little bit hard on the old man?" 
This from Mr. Lossing, who was biting his 
cigar in deep thought. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"That will not prevent his doing his duty; 
why, the old man for very pride will be the 
first to obey the law. You'll <hi rend="italic">see!"</hi> 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Six months later they did see, since it was 
mostly due to Fitzmaurice's efforts that the 
reform candidate was elected; as a consequence, 
Tommy became prosecuting attorney; and, to 
the amazement of the critics, made the best 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0133" n="108"/> 
 
prosecuting attorney that the city had ever 
known. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
It was during the campaign that Mrs. Carriswood  
met him. Her goddaughter, daughter 
of the friend to whom years ago she described 
Tommy, was with her. This time Mrs. Carriswood  
had recently added Florida to her disappointments  
in climates, and was back, as she 
told Mrs. Lossing, "with a real sense of relief 
in a climate that was too bad to make any pretensions." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
She had brought Miss Van Harlem to see 
the shops. It may be that she would not have 
been averse to Harry Lossing's growing interested  
in young Margaret. She had seen a great 
deal of Harry while he was East at school, and 
he remained her first favorite, while Margaret 
was as good as she was pretty, and had half a 
million of dollars in her own right. They had 
seen Harry, and he was showing them through 
the different buildings or "shops," when a man 
entered who greeted him cordially, and whom 
he presented to Mrs. Carriswood. It was 
Tommy Fitzmaurice, grown into a handsome 
young man. He brought his heels together 
and made the ladies a solemn bow. "Pleased 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0134" n="109"/> 
 
to meet you, ladies; how do you like the 
West?" said Tommy. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
His black locks curled about his ears, which 
seemed rather small now; he had a good nose 
and a mobile, clean-shaven face. His hands 
were very white and soft, and the rim of linen 
above them was dazzling. His black frock-coat 
was buttoned snugly about his slim waist. He 
brushed his face with a fine silk handkerchief, 
 and thereby diffused the fragrance of the 
best imported cologne among the odors of 
wood and turpentine. A diamond pin sparkled 
from his neckscarf. The truth is, he knew 
that the visitors were coming and had made 
a state toilet. "He looks half like an actor and 
half like a clergyman, and he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> all a politician," 
thought Mrs. Carriswood; "I don't think I 
shall like him any more." While she thought, 
she was inclining her slender neck toward him, 
and the gentlest interest and pleasure beamed 
out of her beautiful, dark eyes. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"We like the West, but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have liked it for 
ten years; this is not my first visit," said Mrs. 
Carriswood. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I have reason to be glad for that, madam. 
I never made another speech so good." 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0135" n="110"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He had remembered her; she laughed. "I 
had thought that you would forget." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"How could I, when you have not changed 
at all?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"But you have," says Mrs. Carriswood, 
hardly knowing whether to show the young 
man his place or not. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, ma'am, naturally. But I have not 
learned how to make a speech yet." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Ah, but you make very good ones, Harry 
tells me." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Much obliged, Harry. No, ma'am, Harry 
is a nice boy; but he doesn't know. I know 
there is a lot to learn, and I guess a lot to 
unlearn; and I feel all outside; I don't even 
know how to get at it. I have wished a thousand  
times that I could talk with the lady who 
taught me to speak in the first place." He 
walked on by her side, talking eagerly. "You 
don't know how many times I have felt I would 
give most anything for the opportunity of just 
seeing you and talking with you; those things 
you said to me I always remembered." He 
had a hundred questions evidently stinging his 
tongue. And some of them seemed to Mrs. 
Carriswood very apposite. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0136" n="111"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I'm on the outside of such a lot of things," 
says he. "When I first began to suspect that 
I was on the outside was when I went to the 
High School, and sometimes I was invited to 
Harry's; that was my first acquaintance with 
cultivated society. You can't learn manners 
from books, ma'am. I learned them at Harry's. 
That is," &mdash; he colored and laughed, &mdash; "I learned 
<hi rend="italic">some</hi>. There's plenty left, I know. Then, I 
went to the University. Some of the boys came 
from homes like Harry's, and some of the professors  
there used to ask us to their houses; and 
I saw engravings and oil paintings, and heard 
the conversation of persons of culture. All this 
only makes me know enough to <hi rend="italic">know</hi> I am outside. 
 I can see the same thing with the lawyers, 
too. There is a set of them that are after 
another kind of things; that think themselves 
above me and my sort of fellows. You know all 
the talk about this being a free and equal country. 
 That's the tallest kind of humbug, madam! 
It is that. There are sets, one above another, 
everywhere; big bugs and little bugs, if you will 
excuse the expression. And you can't influence 
the big ones without knowing how they feel. A 
fellow can't be poking in the dark in a speech or 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0137" n="112"/> 
 
anywhere else. Now, these fellows here, they go 
into politics, sometimes; and there, I tell you, we 
come the nearest to a fair field and no favor! It 
is the best fellow gets the prize there &mdash; the sharpest-witted, the nerviest, and stanchest. Oh, talk 
of machine politics! all the soft chaps who ain't 
willing to get up early in the morning, or to go 
out in the wet, <hi rend="italic">they</hi> howl about the primaries and 
corruption; let them get up and clean the primaries  
instead of holding their noses! Those 
fellows, I'm not nice enough for them, but I can 
beat them every time. They make a monstrous 
racket in the newspapers, but when election 
comes on they can't touch side, edge, or bottom! 
" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Discoursing in this fashion, with digressions to 
Harry in regard to the machines, the furniture, 
and the sales, that showed Mrs. Carriswood that 
he meant to keep an eye on his twenty odd 
thousand dollars, he strolled at her side. To 
Miss Van Harlem he scarcely said three words. 
In fact, he said exactly three words, uttered as 
Miss Margaret's silken skirts swung too near a pot 
of varnish. They were "Look out, miss!" and 
at the same second, Tommy (who was in advance, 
with really no call to know of the danger), turned 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0138" n="113"/> 
 
on his heel and whisked the skirts away, turning 
back to pick up the sentence he had dropped. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Tommy told Harry that Miss Van Harlem was 
a very handsome lady, but haughty-looking. 
Then he talked for half an hour about the cleverness  
of Mrs. Carriswood. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I am inclined to think Tommy will rise." 
(Mrs. Carriswood was describing the interview to 
her cousin, the next day.) "What do you think 
he said to me last of all? 'How,' said he, 'does 
a man, a gentleman' &mdash; it had a touch of the 
pathetic, don't you know, the little hesitation he 
made on the word &mdash; 'how does he show his gratitude  
to a lady who has done him a great service? 
' 'Young or old?' I said. 'Oh, a married 
lady,' he said, 'very much admired, who has been 
everywhere.' Wasn't that clever of him? I told 
him that a man usually sent a few flowers. You 
saw the basket to-day &mdash; evidently regardless of 
expense. And fancy, there was a card, a card 
with a gilt edge and his name written on it." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"The card was his mother's. She has visiting 
cards, now, and pays visits once a year in a livery 
carriage. Poor Mrs. Fitzmaurice, she is always so 
scared; and she is such a good soul! Tommy is 
very good to her." 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0139" n="114"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"How about the father? Does he still keep 
that 'nice' saloon?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes; but he talks of retiring. They are not 
 
</p> 
 

 
<p> 
 
poor at all, and Tommy is their only child; the 
others died. It is hard on the old man to retire, 
 for he isn't so very old in fact, but if he 
once is convinced that his calling stands in the 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0140" n="115"/> 
 
way of Tommy's career, he won't hesitate a 
second." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Poor people," said Mrs. Carriswood; "do 
you know, Grace, I can see Tommy's future; he 
will grow to be a boss, a political boss. He will 
become rich by keeping your streets always being 
cleaned &mdash; which means never clean &mdash; and giving 
you the worst fire department and police to be 
obtained for money; and, by and by, a grateful 
machine will make him mayor, or send him to the 
Legislature, very likely to Congress, where he will 
misrepresent the honest State of Iowa. Then he 
will bloom out in a social way, and marry a gentlewoman, 
 and they will snub the old people who 
are so proud of him." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, we shall see," said Mrs. Lossing; "I 
think better things of Tommy. So does Harry." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Part of the prophecy was to be speedily fulfilled. 
 Two years later, the Honorable Thomas 
Fitzmaurice was elected mayor of his city, 
elected by the reform party, on account of his 
eminent services &mdash; and because he was the only 
man in sight who had the ghost of a chance of 
winning. Harry's version was: "Tommy jests at 
his new principles, but that is simply because he 
doesn't comprehend what they are. He laughs 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0141" n="116"/> 
 
at reform in the abstract; but every concrete, 
practical reform he is as anxious as I or anybody 
to bring about. And he will get them here, 
too." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He was as good as his word; he gave the city 
an admirable administration, with neither fear nor 
favor. Some of the "boys" still clung to him; 
these, according to Harry, were the better 
"boys," who had the seeds of good in them and 
only needed opportunity and a leader. Tommy 
did not flag in zeal; rather, as the time went on 
and he soared out of the criminal courts into big 
civil cases involving property, he grew up to the 
level of his admirers' praises. "Tommy," wrote 
Mr. Lossing, presently, "is beginning to take 
himself seriously. He has been told so often 
that he is a young lion of reform, that he begins  
to study the role in dead earnest. I don't 
talk this way to Harry, who believes in him and 
is training him for the representative for our district. 
 What harm? Verily, his is the faith that 
will move mountains. Besides, Tommy is now 
rich; he must be worth a hundred thousand 
dollars, which makes a man of wealth in these 
parts. It is time for him to be respectable." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Notwithstanding this preparation, Mrs. Carriswood 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0142" n="117"/> 
 
(then giving Washington the benefit of 
her doubts of climate) was surprised one day to 
receive a perfectly correct visiting card whereon 
was engraved, "Mr. Thomas Sackville Fitzmaurice, 
 M.C." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The young lady who was with her lifted her 
brilliant hazel eyes and half smiled. "Is it the 
droll young man we met once at Mrs. Lossing's? 
Pray see him, Aunt Margaret," said Miss Van 
Harlem. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Mrs. Carriswood shrugged her shoulders and 
ordered the man to show him up. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
There entered, in the wake of the butler, a distinguished-looking personage who held out his 
hand with a perfect copy of the bow that she saw 
forty times a day. "He is taking himself very 
seriously," she sighed; "he is precisely like anybody  
else!" And she felt her interest snuffed 
out by Tommy's correctness. But, directly, she 
changed her mind; the unfailing charm of his 
race asserted itself in Tommy; she decided that 
he was a delightful, original young man, and in 
ten minutes they were talking in the same odd 
confidence that had always marked their relation. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"How perfectly you are gotten up! Are you 
<hi rend="italic">inside</hi>, now?" 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0143" n="118"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Ah, do you remember that?" said he; 
"that's awfully good of you. Which is so fortunate  
as to please you, my clothes or my deportment?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Both. They are very good. Where did you 
get them, Tommy? I shall take the privilege of 
my age and call you Tommy." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Thank you. The clothes? Oh, I asked Harry  
for the proper thing, and he recommended a 
tailor. I think Harry gave me the manners, 
too." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"And your new principles?" She could not 
resist this little fling. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I owe a great deal in that way to Harry, 
also," answered he, with gravity. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Gone were the days of sarcastic ridicule, of 
visionary politics. Tommy talked of the civil 
service in the tone of Harry himself. He was 
actually eloquent. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Why, Aunt Margaret, he is a remarkable 
young man," exclaimed Miss Van Harlem; "his 
honesty and enthusiasm are refreshing in this 
pessimist place. I hope he will come again. 
Did you notice what lovely eyes he has?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Before long it was not pure good-nature that 
caused Mrs. Carriswood to ask Fitzmaurice to her 
 
</p> 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0144"/> 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0145"/> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0146" n="121"/> 
 
<p> 
 
house. He was known as a rising young man, 
One met him at the best houses; yet he was a 
prodigious worker, and had made his mark in 
committees, before the celebrated speech that 
sent him into all the newspaper columns, or that 
stubborn and infinitely versatile fight against 
odds which inspired the artist of <hi rend="italic">Puck</hi>. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Tommy bore the cartoon to Mrs. Carriswood, 
beaming. She had not seen that light in his face 
since the memorable June afternoon in the Opera-house. 
 He sent the paper to his mother, who 
vowed the picture "did not favor Tommy at all, 
at all. Sure Tommy never had such a red nose!" 
The old man, however, went to his ex-saloon, and 
sat in state all the morning, showing Tommy's 
funny picture. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
It was about this time that Mrs. Carriswood 
observed something that took her breath away: 
Tommy Fitzmaurice had the presumption to be 
attentive to my lady's goddaughter, Miss Van 
Harlem. Nor was this the worst; there were 
indications that Miss Van Harlem, who had refused  
the noble names and titles of two or three 
continental nobles, and the noble name unaccompanied  
by a title of the younger son of an English 
earl, without mentioning the half-dozen "nice" 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0147" n="122"/> 
 
American claimants &mdash; Miss Van Harlem was not 
angry. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The day this staggering blow fell on her, Mrs. 
Carriswood was in her dressing-room, peacefully 
watching Derry unpack a box from Paris, in 
anticipation of a state dinner. And Miss Van 
Harlem, in a bewitching wrapper, sat on the 
lounge and admired. Upon this scene of feminine 
peace and happiness enter the Destroyer, in the 
shape of a note from Tommy Fitzmaurice! Were 
they going on Beatoun's little excursion to Alexandria? 
 If they were, he would move heaven 
and earth to put off a committee meeting, in 
order to join them. By the way, he was to get 
the floor for his speech that afternoon. Wouldn't 
Mrs. Carriswood come to inspire him? Perhaps 
Miss Van Harlem would not be bored by a little 
of it. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
It was a well-worded note; as Mrs. Carriswood 
read it she realized for the first time how completely  
Tommy was acclimated in society. She 
remembered his plaint years ago, and his awe of 
"oil paintings" and "people of culture;" and 
she laughed half-sadly as she passed the note over 
to Miss Van Harlem. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I presume it is the Alexandria excursion that 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0148" n="123"/> 
 
the Beatouns were talking about yesterday," she 
said, languidly. "He wants to show that young 
Irishman that we have a mild flavor of antiquity, 
ourselves. We are to see Alexandria and have a 
real old Virginian dinner, including one of the 
famous Beatoun hams and some of the '69 Chateau  
Yquem and the sacred '47 port. I suppose 
he will have the four-in-hand buckboard. 'A 
small party ' &mdash; that will mean the Honorable Basil 
Sackville, Mrs. Beatoun, Lilly Denning, probably 
one of the Cabinet girls, Colonel Turner, and that 
young Russian Beatoun is so fond of, Tommy 
Fitzmaurice &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Why do you always call Mr. Fitzmaurice 
Tommy?" &mdash; this interruption comes with a slight 
rise of color from young Margaret. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Everybody calls him Tommy in his own 
town; a politician as popular as he with the 
boys is naturally Tommy or Jerry or Billy. 
They slap him on the back or sit with an arm 
around his neck and concoct the ways to rule 
us." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I don't think anyone slaps Mr. Fitzmaurice 
on the back and calls him Tommy, <hi rend="italic">now</hi>," says 
Margaret, with a little access of dignity. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I dare say his poor old father and mother 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0149" n="124"/> 
 
don't venture on that liberty; I wish you had 
seen them &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"He has told me about them," says Margaret. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
And Mrs. Carriswood's dismay was such that 
for a second she simply gasped. Were things 
so far along that such confessions were made? 
Tommy must be very confident to venture; it 
was shrewd, very shrewd, to forestall Mrs. Carriswood's  
sure revelations &mdash; oh, Tommy was not 
a politician for nothing! 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Besides," Margaret went on, with the same 
note of repressed feeling in her voice, "his is a 
good family, if they have decayed; his ancestor 
was Lord Fitzmaurice in King James's time." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"She takes <hi rend="italic">him</hi> seriously too!" thought Mrs. 
Carriswood, with inexpressible consternation; 
"what <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> I say to her mother?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Strange to say, perhaps, considering that she 
was so frankly a woman of the world, her stubbornest  
objection to Tommy was not an objection 
of expediency. She had insensibly grown to take 
his success for granted, like the rest of the Washington  
world; he would be a governor, a senator, 
he might be &mdash; anything! And he was perfectly 
presentable, now; no, it would be on the whole 
an investment in the future that would pay well 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0150" n="125"/> 
 
enough; his parents would be awkward, but they 
were old people, not likely to be too much <hi rend="italic">en 
&eacute;vidence</hi>. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Mrs. Carriswood, while not overjoyed, would 
not feel crushed by such a match, but she did 
view what she regarded as Tommy's moral instability, 
 with a dubious and fearful eye. He was 
earnest enough for his new principles now; but 
what warrant was there of his sincerity? Margaret  
and her mother were high-minded women. It 
was the gallant knight of her party and her political  
faith that the girl admired, the valiant fight, 
not the triumph! No mere soldier of fortune, no 
matter how successful or how brilliant, could win 
her; if Tommy were the mercenary, not the 
knight, no worldly glory could compensate his 
wife. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Wherefore, after a bad quarter of an hour 
reflecting on these things, Mrs. Carriswood went 
to the Capitol, resolved to take her goddaughter 
away. She would not withdraw her acceptance 
of the Beatouns' invitation, no; let the Iowa 
congressman have every opportunity to display 
his social shortcomings in contrast with the accomplished  
Russian, and Jack Turner, the most 
elegant man in the army; the next day would be 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0151" n="126"/> 
 
time enough for a telegram and a sudden flitting. 
Yet in the midst of her plans for Tommy's discomfiture  
she was assailed by a queer regret and 
reluctance. Tommy's fascination had affected 
even a professional critic of life; he had been so 
amusing, so willing, so trusting, so useful, that 
her chill interest had warmed into liking. She 
felt a moving of the heart as the handsome black 
head arose, and the first notes of that resonant, 
thrilling voice swelled above the din on the floor. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
It was the day of his great speech, the speech 
that made him, it was said. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
As Mrs. Carriswood sank back, turning a little 
in an instinctive effort to repulse her own sympathy, 
 she was aware of the presence near her of 
an elderly man and woman. The old man wore a 
shining silk hat and shining new black clothes. 
His expansive shirt-bosom was very white, but 
not glossy, and rumpled in places; and his collar 
was of the spiked and antique pattern known as 
a "dickey." His wrinkled, red face was edged 
by a white fringe of whisker. He wore large 
gold-bowed spectacles, and his jaws worked incessantly. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The woman was a little, mild, wrinkled creature, 
 with an anxious blue eye and snowy hair, 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0152" n="127"/> 
 
smoothed down over her ears, under her fine 
bonnet. She was richly dressed, but her silks 
and velvets ill suited the season. Had she seen 
them anywhere else, Mrs. Carriswood might not 
have recognized them; but there, with Tommy 
before them, both of them feverishly absorbed in 
Tommy, she recognized them at a glance. She 
had a twinge of pity, watching the old faces pale 
and kindle. With the first rustle of applause, 
she saw the old father slip his hand into the old 
mother's. They sat well behind a pillar; and 
however excited they became, they never so lost 
themselves as to lean in front of their shield. 
This, also, she noticed. The speech over, the 
woman wiped her eyes. The old man joined in 
the tumult of applause that swept over the galleries, 
 but the old woman pulled his arm, evidently  
feeling that it was not decent for them to 
applaud. She sat rigid, with red cheeks and her 
eyes brimming; he was swaying and clapping and 
laughing in a roar of delight. But it was he that 
drew her away, finally, while she fain would have 
lingered to look at Tommy receiving congratulations  
below. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Poor things," said Mrs. Carriswood, "I do 
believe they haven't let him know that they are 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0153" n="128"/> 
 
here." And she remembered how she had pitied 
them for this very possibility of humiliation years 
before. But she did not pursue the adventure, 
and some obscure motive prevented her speaking 
of it to Miss Van Harlem. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Did Tommy's parents tell Tommy? If they 
did, Tommy made no sign. The morning found 
him with the others, in a beautiful white flannel 
suit, with a silk shirt and a red silk sash, looking 
handsomer than any man of the party. He took 
the congratulations of the company modestly. 
Either he was not much puffed up, or he had the 
art of concealment. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
They saw Alexandria in a conscientious fashion, 
 for the benefit of the guest of the day. He 
was a modest young fellow with a nose rather too 
large for his face, a long upper lip, and frank blue 
eyes. He made himself agreeable to one of the 
Cabinet girls, on the front seat, while Tommy, 
just behind him, had Miss Van Harlem and bliss 
for his portion. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The old streets, the toppling roofs, the musty 
warehouses, the uneven pavement, all pleased the 
young creatures out in the sunshine. They made 
merry over the ancient ball-room, where Washington  
had asked a far-away ancestress of Beatoun to 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0154" n="129"/> 
 
dance; and they decorously walked through the 
old church. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
<hi rend="italic">It</hi> happened in the church. Mrs. Carriswood 
was behind the others; so she saw them come in, 
the same little old couple of the Capitol. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
In the chancel, Beatoun was explaining; beside  
Beatoun shone a curly black head that they 
knew. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Mrs. Carriswood sat in one of the high old 
pews. Through a crack she could look into the 
next pew; and there they stood. She heard the 
old man: "Whist, Molly, let's be getting out of 
this! <hi rend="italic">He</hi> is here with all his grand friends. 
Don't let us be interrupting him." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The old woman's voice was so like Tommy's 
that it made Mrs. Carriswood start. Very softly 
she spoke: "I only want to look at him a minute, 
 Pat, jest a minute. I ain't seen him for so 
long." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"And is it any longer for you than for me?" 
retorted the husband. "Ye know what ye promised  
if I'd be taking you here, unbeknownst. 
Don't look his way! Look like ye was a stranger 
to him. Don't let us be mortifying him wid our 
country ways. Like as not 'tis the prisidint, 
himself, he is colloguein' wid, this blessed minute. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0155" n="130"/> 
 
Shtep back and be a stranger to him, 
woman!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
A stranger to him, his own mother! But she 
stepped back; she turned her patient face. Then 
&mdash; Tommy saw her. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
A wave of red flushed all over his face. He 
took two steps down the aisle, and caught the 
little figure in his arms. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Why, mother?" he cried, "why, mother, 
where did you drop from?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
And before Mrs. Carriswood could speak she 
saw him step back and push young Sackville forward, 
 crying, "This is my father, this is the boy 
that knew your grandmother." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He did it so easily; he was so entirely unaffected, 
 so perfectly unconscious, that there was 
nothing at all embarrassing for anyone. Even the 
Cabinet girl, with a grandmother in very humble 
life, who must be kept in the background, could 
not feel disconcerted. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
For this happy result Mrs. Carriswood owns a 
share of the credit. She advanced on the first 
pause, and claimed acquaintanceship with the 
Fitzmaurices. The story of their last meeting 
and Tommy's first triumph in oratory came, of 
course; the famous horseshoe received due mention; 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0156" n="131"/> 
 
and Tommy described with much humor 
his terror of the stage. From the speech to its 
most effective passage was a natural transition; 
equally natural the transition to Tommy's grandmother, 
 the Irish famine, and the benevolence of 
Lady Sackville. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Everybody was interested, and it was Sackville 
himself, who brought the Fitzmaurices' noble ancestors, 
 the apocryphal Viscounts Fitzmaurice of 
King James's creation, on to the carpet. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He was entirely serious. "My grandmother 
told me of your great-grandfather, Lord Fitzmaurice; 
 she saw him ride to hounds once, when she 
was a little girl. They say he was the boldest 
rider in Ireland, and a renowned duellist too. 
King James gave the title to his grandfather, 
didn't he? and the countryside kept it, if it was 
given rather too late in the day to be useful. I 
am glad you have restored the family fortunes, 
Mr. Fitzmaurice." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The Cabinet girl looked on Tommy with respect, 
 and Miss Van Harlem blushed like an 
angel. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"All is lost," said Mrs. Carriswood to herself; 
yet she smiled. Going home, she found a word 
for Tommy's ear. The old Virginian dinner had 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0157" n="132"/> 
 
been most successful. The Fitzmaurices (who 
had been almost forced into the banquet by Beatoun's  
imperious hospitality) were not a wet blanket  
in the least. Patrick Fitzmaurice, brogue and 
all, was an Irish gentleman without a flaw. He 
blossomed out into a modest wag; and told two 
or three comic stories as acceptably as he was 
used to tell them to a very different circle &mdash; only, 
carrying a fresher flavor of wit to this circle, perhaps, 
 it enjoyed them more. Mrs. Fitzmaurice 
looked scared and ate almost nothing, with the 
greatest propriety, and her fork in her left hand. 
Yet even she thawed under Miss Van Harlem's 
attentions and gentle Mrs. Beatoun's tact, and 
the winning ways of the last Beatoun baby. She 
took this absent cherub to her heart with such 
undissembled warmth that its mother ever since 
has called her "a sweet, funny little old lady." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
They were both (Patrick and his wife) quite 
unassuming and retiring, and no urging could dissuade  
them from parting with the company at the 
tavern door. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"My word, Tommy, your mother and I can git 
home by ourselves," whispered honest Patrick; 
"we've not exceeded &mdash; if the wines <hi rend="italic">were</hi> good. I 
never exceeded in my life, God take the glory!" 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0158" n="133"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
But he embraced Tommy so affectionately in 
parting that I confess Mrs. Carriswood had suspicions. 
 Yet, surely, it is more likely that his 
brain was &mdash; let us not say <hi rend="italic">turned</hi>, but just a wee 
bit <hi rend="italic">tilted</hi>, by the joy and triumph of the occasion 
rather than by Beatoun's port or champagne. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
But Mrs. Carriswood's word had nothing to 
do with Tommy's parents, ostensibly, though, in 
truth, it had everything to do. She said: "Will 
you dine with us to-morrow, quite <hi rend="italic">en famille</hi>, 
Thomas?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I ought to tell you, I suppose, that I find 
your house a pretty dangerous paradise, Mrs. 
Carriswood," says Tommy. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"And I find you a most dangerous angel, 
Thomas; but &mdash; you see I ask you!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Thank you," answers Tommy, in a different 
tone; "you've always been an angel to me. 
What I owe to you and Harry Lossing &mdash; well, I 
can't talk about it. But see here, Mrs. Carriswood, 
 you always have called me Tommy; now 
you say Thomas; why this state?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I think you have won your brevet, Thomas." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He looked puzzled, and she liked him the 
better that he should not make enough of his 
conduct to understand her; but, though she 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0159" n="134"/> 
 
has called him Tommy often since, he keeps 
the brevet in her thoughts. In fact, Mrs. Carriswood  
is beginning to take the Honorable Thomas 
Fitzmaurice and his place in the world seriously, 
herself.

<head>MOTHER EMERITUS</head> 
 
<p> 
THE Louders lived on the second floor, at the 
head of the stairs, in the Lossing Building. 
There is a restaurant to the right; and a new 
doctor, every six months, who is every kind of a 
healer except "regular," keeps the permanent 
boarders in gossip, to the left; two or three 
dressmakers, a dentist, and a diamond merchant 
up-stairs, one flight; and half a dozen families 
and a dozen single tenants higher &mdash; so you see 
the Louders had plenty of neighbors. In fact, 
the multitude of the neighbors is one cause of 
my story. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Tilly Louder came home from the Lossing 
factory (where she is a typewriter) one February 
afternoon. As she turned the corner, she was 
face to the river, which is not so full of shipping 
in winter that one cannot see the steel-blue glint 
of the water. Back of her the brick paved street 
climbed the hill, under a shapeless arch of trees. 
The remorseless pencil of a railway has drawn 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0161" n="136"/> 
 
black lines at the foot of the hill; and, all day 
and all night, slender red bars rise and sink in 
their black sockets, to the accompaniment of the 
outcry of tortured steam. All day, if not all 
night, the crooked pole slips up and down the 
trolley wire, as the yellow cars rattle, and flash, 
and clang a spiteful little bell, that sounds like a 
soprano bark, over the crossings. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
It is customary in the Lossing Building to say, 
"We are so handy to the cars." The street is a 
handsome street, not free from dingy old brick 
boxes of stores below the railway, but fast replacing  
them with fairer structures. The Lossing 
Building has the wide arches, the recessed doors, 
the balconies and the colonnades of modern business  
architecture. The occupants are very proud 
of the balconies, in particular; and, summer days, 
these will be a mass of greenery and bright tints. 
To-day, it was so warm, February day though it 
was, that some of the potted plants were sunning 
themselves outside the windows. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Tilly could see them if she craned her neck. 
There were some bouvardias and fuchsias of her 
mother's among them. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a pretty building," said Tilly; and, for 
some reason, she frowned. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0162" n="137"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
She was a young woman, but not a very young 
woman. Her figure was slim, and she looked better  
in loose waists than in tightly fitted gowns. 
She wore a dark green gown with a black jacket, 
and a scarlet shirt-waist underneath. Her face 
was long, with square chin and high cheek-bones, 
and thin, firm lips; yet she was comely, because 
of her lustrous black hair, her clear, gray eyes, 
and her charming, fair skin. She had another 
gift: everything about her was daintily neat; at 
first glance one said, "Here is a person who has 
spent pains, if not money, on her toilet." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
By this time Tilly was entering the Lossing 
Building. Half-way up the stairway a hand 
plucked her skirts. The hand belonged to a 
tired-faced woman in black, on whose breast glittered  
a little crowd of pins and threaded needles, 
like the insignia of an Order of Toil. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Please excuse me, Miss Tilly," said the woman, 
 at the same time presenting a flat package 
in brown paper, "but <hi rend="italic">will</hi> you give this pattern 
back to your mother. I am so very much 
obliged. I don't know how I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> git along 
without your mother, Tilly." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I'll give the pattern to her," said Tilly, and 
she pursued her way. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0163" n="138"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Not very far. A stout woman and a thin 
young man, with long, wavy, red hair, awaited 
her on the landing. The woman held a plate of 
cake which she thrust at Tilly the instant they 
were on the same level, saying: "The cake was 
just splendid, tell your mother; it's a lovely 
recipe, and will you tell her to take this, and see 
how well I succeeded?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"And &mdash; ah &mdash; Miss Louder," said the man, as the 
stout woman rustled away, "here are some <hi rend="italic">Banner  
of Lights;</hi> I think she'd be interested in some 
of the articles on the true principles of the inspirational  
faith &mdash;" Tilly placed the bundle of 
newspapers at the base of her load &mdash; "and &mdash; and, 
I wish you'd tell your dear mother that, under 
the angels, her mustard plaster really saved 
my life." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I'll tell her," said Tilly. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
She had advanced a little space before a young 
girl in a bright blue silk gown flung a radiant 
presence between her and the door. "Oh, Miss 
Tilly," she murmured, blushing, "will you just 
give your mother this? &mdash; it's &mdash; it's Jim's photograph. 
 You tell her it's <hi rend="italic">all</hi> right; and <hi rend="italic">she</hi> was exactly  
right, and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was wrong. She'll understand." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Tilly, with a look of resignation, accepted a 
 
</p> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0164"/>
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0165" n="140"/>
<p>  
stiff package done up in white tissue paper. She 
had now only three steps to take: she took two, 
only two, for &mdash; "Miss Tilly, <hi rend="italic">please!"</hi> a voice 
pealed around the corner, while a flushed and 
breathless young woman, with a large baby toppling  
over her lean shoulder, staggered into view. 
"My!" she panted, "ain't it tiresome lugging a 
child! I missed the car, of course, coming home 
from ma's. Oh, say, Tilly, your mother was so 
good, she said she'd tend Blossom next time I 
went to the doctor's, and &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I'll take the baby," said Tilly. She hoisted 
the infant on to her own shoulder with her right 
arm. "Perhaps you'll be so kind's to turn the 
handle of the door," said she in a slightly caustic 
tone, "as I haven't got any hands left. Please 
shut it, too." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
As the young mother opened the door, Tilly 
entered the parlor. For a second she stood and 
stared grimly about her. The furniture of the 
room was old-fashioned but in the best repair. 
There was a cabinet organ in one corner. A 
crayon portrait of Tilly's father (killed in the 
civil war) glared out of a florid gilt frame. Perhaps  
it was the fault of the portrait, but he had 
a peevish frown. There were two other portraits 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0166" n="141"/> 
 
of him, large ghastly gray tintypes in oval frames 
of rosewood, obscurely suggesting coffins. In 
these he looked distinctly sullen. He was represented  
in uniform (being a lieutenant of volunteers),  
and the artist had conscientiously gilded 
his buttons until, as Mrs. Louder was wont to 
observe, "It most made you want to cut them 
off with the scissors." There were other tintypes  
and a flock of photographs in the room. 
What Mrs. Louder named "a throw" decorated 
each framed picture and each chair. The largest 
arm-chair was drawn up to a table covered with 
books and magazines: in the chair sat Mrs. 
Louder, reading. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
At Tilly's entrance she started and turned her 
head, and then one could see that the tears were 
streaming down her cheeks. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Now, <hi rend="italic">mother!"</hi> exploded Tilly. Kicking the 
door open, she marched into the bed-chamber. 
An indignant sweep of one arm sent the miscellany  
of gifts into a rocking-chair; an indignant 
curve of the other landed the baby on the bed. 
Tilly turned on her mother. "Now, mother, 
what did you promise &mdash; <hi rend="italic">hush!</hi> will you?" (The 
latter part of the sentence a fierce <hi rend="italic">"aside"</hi> to the 
infant on the bed.) In a second Mrs. Louder's 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0167" n="142"/> 
 
arms were encircling him, and she was soothing 
him on her broad shoulder, where I know not 
how many babies have found comfort. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Jane Louder was a tall woman &mdash; tall and portly. 
She had a massive repose about her, a kind of 
soft dignity; and a stranger would not guess how 
tender was her heart. Deprecatingly she looked 
up at her only child, standing in judgment over 
her. Her eyes were fine still, though they had 
sparkled and wept for more than half a century. 
They were not gray, like Tilly's, but a deep violet, 
with black eyelashes and eyebrows. Black, once, 
had been the hair under the widow's cap, now 
streaked with silver; but Jane Louder's skin was 
fresh and daintily tinted like her daughter's, for 
all its fine wrinkles. Her voice when she spoke 
was mellow and slow, with a nervous vibration 
of apology. "Never mind, dear," she said, "I 
was just reading 'bout the Russians." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> it! You promised me you wouldn't 
cry about the Russians any more." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I know, Tilly, but Alma Brown lent this to 
me, herself. There's a beautiful article in it about 
'The Horrors of Hunger.' It would make your 
heart ache! I wish you would read it, Tilly." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No, thank you. I don't care to have my 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0168" n="143"/> 
 
heart ache. I'm not going to read any more 
horrors about the Russians, or hear them either, 
if I can help it. I have to write Mr. Lossing's 
letters about them, and that's enough. I've 
given all I can afford, and you've given more 
than you can afford; and I helped get up the 
subscription at the shops. I've done all I could; 
and now I ain't going to have my feelings harrowed  
up any more, when it won't do me nor the 
Russians a mite of good." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"But I cayn't <hi rend="italic">help</hi> it, Tilly. I cayn't take any 
comfort in my meals, thinking of that awful black 
bread the poor children starve rather than eat; 
and, Tilly, they ain't so dirty as some folks think! 
I read in a magazine how they have <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to bathe 
twice a week by their religion; and there's a 
bath-house in every village. Tilly, do you know 
how much money they've raised here?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Over three thousand. This town is the 
greatest town for giving &mdash; give to the cholera 
down South, give to Johnstown, give to Grinnell, 
give to cyclones, give to fires. <hi rend="italic">The Freeman</hi> always  
starts up a subscription, and Mr. Bayard 
runs the thing, and Mr. Lossing always gives. 
Mother, I tell you <hi rend="italic">he</hi> makes them hustle when 
he takes hold. He's the chairman here, and he 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0169" n="144"/> 
 
has township chairmen appointed for every township. 
 He's so popular they start in to oblige 
him, and then, someway, he makes them all interested. 
 I must tell you of a funny letter he 
had to-day from a Captain Ferguson, out at 
Baxter. He's a rich farmer with lots of influence 
and a great worker, Mr. Lossing says. But this 
is 'most word for word what he wrote: 'Dear 
Sir: I am sorry for the Russians, but my wife is 
down with the la grippe, and I can't get a hired 
girl; so I have to stay with her. If you'll get 
me a hired girl, I'll get you a lot of money for 
the Russians.'" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Did he git a girl? I mean Mr. Lossing." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No, ma'am. He said he'd try if it was the 
city, but it was easier finding gold-mines than 
girls that would go into the country. See here, 
I'm forgetting your presents. Mother, you look 
real dragged and &mdash; queer!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"It's nothing; jist a thought kinder struck me 
'bout &mdash; 'bout that girl." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Tilly was sorting out the parcels and explaining  
them; at the end of her task her mind harked 
back to an old grievance. "Mother," said she, 
"I've been thinking for a long time, and I've 
made up my mind." 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0170" n="145"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, dearie." Mrs. Louder's eyes grew troubled. 
 She knew something of the quality of 
Tilly's mind, which resembled her father's in a 
peculiar immobility. Once let her decision run 
into any mould (be it whatsoever it might), and 
let it stiffen, there was no chance, any more than 
with other iron things, of its bending. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Positively I could hardly get up the stairs today,"  
said Tilly &mdash; she was putting her jacket and 
hat away in her orderly fashion; of necessity her 
back was to Mrs. Louder &mdash; "there was such a raft 
of people wanting to send stuff and messages to 
you. You are just working yourself to death; and, 
mother, I am convinced we have <hi rend="italic">got to move!"</hi> 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Mrs. Louder dropped into a chair and gasped. 
The baby, who had fallen asleep, stirred uneasily. 
It was not a pretty child; its face was heavy, its 
little cheeks were roughened by the wind, its 
lower lip sagged, its chin creased into the semblance  
of a fat old man's. But Jane Louder 
gazed down on it with infinite compassion. She 
stroked its head as she spoke. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Tilly," said she, "I've been in this block, 
Mrs. Carleton and me, ever since it was built; 
and, some way, between us we've managed to 
keep the run of all the folks in it; at least when 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0171" n="146"/> 
 
they were in any trouble. We've worked together  
like sisters. She's 'Piscopal, and I guess 
I'm Unitarian; but never a word between us. 
We tended the Willardses through diphtheria 
and the Hopkinses through small-pox, and we 
steamed and fumigated the rooms together. It 
was her first found out the Dillses were letting 
that twelve-year-old child run the gasoline stove, 
and she threatened to tell Mr. Lossing, and they 
begged off; and when it exploded we put it out 
together, with flour out of her flour-barrel, for 
the poor, shiftless things hadn't half a sack full 
of their own; and her and me, we took half the 
care of that little neglected Ellis baby that was 
always sitting down in the sticky fly-paper, poor 
innocent child. He's took the valedictory at the 
High School, Tilly, now. No, Tilly, I couldn't 
bring myself to leave this building, where I've 
married them, and buried them, and born them, 
you may say, being with so many of their 
mothers; I feel like they was all my children. 
Don't <hi rend="italic">ask</hi> me." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Tilly's head went upward and backward with a 
little dilatation of the nostrils. "Now, mother," 
said she in a voice of determined gentleness, 
"just listen to me. Would I ask you to do anything

<p> 
 that wouldn't be for your happiness? I 
have found a real pretty house up on Fifteenth 
Street; and we'll keep house together, just as 
cosey; and have a woman come to wash and iron 
and scrub, so it won't be a bit hard; and be right 
on the street-cars; and you won't have to drudge 
helping Mrs. Carleton extra times with her restaurant." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"But, Tilly," eagerly interrupted Mrs. Louder, 
"you know I dearly love to cook, and she <hi rend="italic">pays</hi> 
me. I couldn't feel right to take any of the 
pension money, or the little property your father 
left me, away from the house expenses; but what 
I earn myself, it is <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a comfort to give away 
out of <hi rend="italic">that</hi>." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Tilly ran over and kissed the agitated face. 
"You dear, generous mother!" cried she, <hi rend="italic">"I'll</hi> 
give you all the money you want to spend or 
give. I got another rise in my salary of five a 
month. Don't you worry." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"You ain't thinking of doing anything right 
away, Tilly?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Don't you think it's best done and over with, 
after we've decided, mother? You have worked 
so hard all your life I want to give you some ease 
and peace now." 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0174" n="149"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"But, Tilly, I love to work; I wouldn't be 
happy to do nothing, and I'd get so fleshy!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Tilly only laughed. She did not crave the 
show of authority. Let her but have her own 
way, she would never flaunt her victories. She 
was imperious, but she was not arrogant. For 
months she had been pondering how to give her 
mother an easier life; and she set the table for 
supper, in a filial glow of satisfaction, never 
dreaming that her mother, in the kitchen, was 
keeping her head turned from the stove lest she 
should cry into the fried ham and stewed potatoes. 
 But, at a sudden thought, Jane Louder 
laid her big spoon down to wipe her eyes. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Here you are, Jane Louder" &mdash; thus she addressed  
herself &mdash; "mourning and grieving to leave 
your friends and be laid aside for a useless old 
woman, and jist be taken care of, and you clean 
forgetting the chance the Lord gives you to 
help more'n you ever helped in your life! For 
shame!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
A smile of exaltation, of lofty resolution, 
erased the worry lines on her face. "Why, it 
might be to save twenty lives," said she; but in 
the very speaking of the words a sharp pain 
wrenched her heart again, and she caught up 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0175" n="150"/> 
 
the baby from the floor, where he sat in a wall 
of chairs, and sobbed over him: "Oh, how can I 
go away when I got to go for good so soon? I 
want every minnit!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
She never thought of disputing Tilly's wishes. 
"It's only fair," said Jane. "She's lived here all 
these years to please me, and now I ought to be 
willing to go to please her." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Neither did she for a moment hope to change 
Tilly's determination. "She was the settest baby 
ever was," thought poor Jane, tossing on her pillow, 
 in the night watches, "and it's grown with 
every inch of her!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
But in the morning she surprised her daughter. 
"Tilly," said she at the breakfast-table, "Tilly, 
I got something I must do, and I don't want you 
to oppose me." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Good gracious, ma!" said Tilly; "as if I ever 
opposed you!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"You know how bad I have been feeling about 
the poor Russians &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"And how I've wished and wished I could do 
something &mdash; something to <hi rend="italic">count?</hi> I never could, 
Tilly, because I ain't got the money or the intellect; 
 but s'posing I could do it for somebody 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0176" n="151"/> 
 
else, like this Captain Ferguson who could do so 
much if he just could get a hired girl to take care 
of his wife. Well, I do know how to cook and to 
keep a house neat and to do for the sick &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Tilly could restrain herself no longer; her voice 
rose to a shout of dismay &mdash; "Mother Louder, you 
<hi rend="italic">ain't</hi> thinking of going to be the Ferguson's <hi rend="italic">hired 
girl!"</hi> 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Not their hired girl, Tilly; just their help, so 
as he can work for those poor starving creatures." 
Jane strangled a sob in her throat. Tilly, in a 
kind of stupor of bewilderment, frowned at her 
plate. Then her clouded face cleared. If Mrs. 
Louder had surprised her daughter, her daughter 
repaid the surprise. "Well, if you feel that way, 
mother," said she, "I won't say a word; and I'll 
ask Mr. Lossing to explain to the Fergusons and 
fix everything. He will." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"You're real good, Tilly." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"And while you're gone I guess it will be a 
good plan to move and git settled &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
For some reason Tilly's throat felt dry, she 
lifted her cup. She did not intend to look across 
the table, but her eyes escaped her. She set the 
coffee down untasted. The clock was slow, she 
muttered; and she left the room. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0177" n="152"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Jane Louder remained in her place, with the 
same pale face, staring at the table-cloth. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"It don't seem like I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> go, now," she 
thought dully to herself; "the time's so awful 
short, I don't s'pose Maria Carleton can git up to 
see me more'n once or twice a month, busy as she 
is! I got so to depend on seeing her every day. 
A sister couldn't be kinder! I don't see how I 
am going to bear it. And to go away, beforehand  
&mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
For a long while she sat, her face hardly changing. 
 At last, when she did push her chair away, 
her lips were tightly closed. She spoke to the 
little pile of books lying on the table in the corner. 
 "I cayn't &mdash; these are my own and you are 
strangers! "She walked across the room to take 
up the same magazine which Tilly had found her 
reading the day before. When she began reading 
she looked stern &mdash; poor Jane, she was steeling her 
heart &mdash; but in a little while she was sniffing and 
blowing her nose. With a groan she flung the 
book aside. "It's no use, I would feel like a 
murderer if I don't go!" said she. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
She did go. Harry Lossing made all the arrangements. 
 Tilly was satisfied. But, then, 
Tilly had not heard Harry's remark to his 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0178" n="153"/> 
 
mother: "Alma says Miss Louder is trying to 
make the old lady move against her will. I dare 
say it would be better to give the young woman 
a chance to miss her mother and take a little 
quiet think." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Tilly saw her mother off on the train to Baxter, 
the Fergusons' station. Being a provident, far-sighted, 
 and also inexperienced traveller, she had 
allowed a full half-hour for preliminary passages 
at arms with the railway officials; and, as the 
train happened to be an hour late, she found 
herself with time to spare, even after she had 
exhausted the catalogue of possible deceptions 
and catastrophes by rail. During the silence 
that followed her last warning, she sat mentally 
keeping tally on her fingers. "Confidence men" 
&mdash; Tilly began with the thumb &mdash; "Never give anybody  
her check. Never lend anybody money. 
Never write her name to anything. Don't get 
out till conductor tells her. In case of accident, 
telegraph me, and keep in the middle of the car, 
off the trucks. Not take care of anybody's baby 
while she goes off for a minute. Not take care of 
babies at all. Or children. Not talk to strangers 
&mdash; good gracious!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Tilly felt a movement of impatience; there, 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0179" n="154"/> 
 
after all her cautions, there was her mother helping  
an old woman, an utterly strange old woman, 
to pile a bird-cage on a bandbox surmounting a 
bag. The old woman was clad in a black alpaca 
frock, made with the voluminous draperies of 
years ago, but with the uncreased folds and the 
brilliant gloss of a new gown. She wore a bonnet  
of a singular shape, unknown to fashion, but 
made out of good velvet. Beneath the bonnet 
(which was large) appeared a little, round, agitated  
old face, with bobbing white curls and white 
teeth set a little apart in the mouth, a defect that 
brought a kind of palpitating frankness into the 
expression. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Now, who <hi rend="italic">has</hi> mother picked up now?" 
thought Tilly. "Well, praise be, she hasn't a 
baby, anyhow!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
She could hear the talk between the two; for 
the old woman being deaf, Mrs. Louder elevated 
her voice, and the old woman, herself, spoke in a 
high, thin pipe that somehow reminded Tilly of 
a lost lamb. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"That's just so," said Mrs. Louder, "a body 
cayn't help worrying over a sick child, especially if 
they're away from you." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Solon and Minnie wouldn't tell me," bleated 
 
</p> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0180"/> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0181" n="156"/> 
<p> 
 the other woman, "they knew I'd worry. Kinder 
hurt me they should keep things from me; but 
they hate to have me upset. They are awful 
good children. But I suspicioned something 
when Alonzo kept writing. Minnie, she wouldn't 
tell me, but I pinned her down and it come out, 
Eliza had the grip bad. And, then, nothing 
would do but I must go to her &mdash; why, Mrs. 
Louder, she's my child! But they wouldn't hark 
to it. 'Fraid to have me travel alone &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I guess they take awful good care of you," 
said Mrs. Louder; and she sighed. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, ma'am, awful." She, too, sighed. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
As she talked her eyes were darting about the 
room, eagerly fixed on every new arrival. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Are you expecting anyone, Mrs. Higbee?" 
said Jane. They seemed, at least, to know each 
other by name, thought Tilly; it was amazing the 
number of people mother did know! 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No," said Mrs. Higbee, "I &mdash; I &mdash; fact is, I'm 
kinder frightened. I &mdash; fact is, Mrs. Louder, I 
guess I'll tell you, though I don't know you very 
well; but I've known about you so long &mdash; I run 
away and didn't tell 'em. I just couldn't stay 
way from Liza. And I took the bird &mdash; for the 
children; and it's my bird, and I was 'fraid Minnie 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0182" n="157"/> 
 
would forget to feed it and it would be lonesome. 
My children are awful kind good children, but 
they don't understand. And if Solon sees me 
he will want me to go back. I know I'm dretful 
foolish; and Solon and Minnie will make me see 
I am. There won't be no good reason for me to 
go, and I'll have to stay; and I feel as if I should 
<hi rend="italic">fly</hi> &mdash; Oh, massy sakes! there's Solon coming down 
the street &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
She ran a few steps in half a dozen ways, then 
fluttered back to her bag and her cage. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well," said Mrs. Louder, drawing herself up 
to her full height, "you <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> go if you want to." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Solon will find me, he'll know the bird-cage! 
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Then a most unexpected helper stepped upon 
the stage. What is the mysterious instinct of 
rebellion to authority that, nine cases out of ten, 
sends us to the aid of a fugitive? Tilly, the 
unconscious despot of her own mother, promptly 
aided and abetted Solon's rebel mother in her 
flight. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Not if <hi rend="italic">I</hi> carry it," said she, snatching up the 
bird-cage; "run inside that den where they sell 
refreshments; he'll see <hi rend="italic">me</hi> and go somewhere 
else." 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0183" n="158"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
It fell out precisely as she planned. They 
heard Solon demanding a lady with a bird-cage of 
the agent; they heard the agent's reply, given 
with official indifference, "There she is, inside." 
Directly, Solon, a small man with an anxious 
mien, ran into the waiting-room, flung a glance of 
disappointment at Tilly, and ran out again. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Tilly went to her client. "Did he look like he 
was anxious?" was the mother's greeting. "Oh, 
I just know he and Minnie will be hunting me 
everywhere. Maybe I had better go home, 'stead 
of to Baxter." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No, you hadn't," said Tilly, with decision. 
"Mother's going to Baxter, too, and if you like, 
minnit you're safely off, I'll go tell your folks." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"You're real kind, I'd be ever so much obliged. 
And you don't mind your ma travelling alone? 
ain't that nice for her!" She seemed much 
cheered by the prospect of company and warmed 
into confidences. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I am kinder lonesome, sometimes, that's a 
fact," said she, "and I kinder wish I lived in a 
block or a flat like your ma. You see, Minnie 
teaches in the public school and she's away all 
day, and she don't like to have me make company 
of the hired girl, though she's a real nice girl. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0184" n="159"/> 
 
And there ain't nothing for me to do, and I feel 
like I wasn't no use any more in the world. I 
remember that's what our old minister in Ohio 
said once. He was a real nice old man; and they 
<hi rend="italic">had</hi> thought everything of him in the parish; but 
he got old and his sermons were long; and so 
they got a young man for assistant; and they 
made <hi rend="italic">him</hi> a <hi rend="italic">pastor americus</hi>, they called it &mdash; some 
sort of Latin. Folks did say the young feller was 
stuck up and snubbed the old man; anyhow, he 
never preached after young Lisbon come; and 
only made the first prayers. But when the old 
folks would ask him to preach some of the old 
sermons they had liked, he only would say, 'No, 
friends, I know more about my sermons, now.' 
He didn't live very long, and I always kinder 
fancied being a <hi rend="italic">americus</hi> killed him. And some 
days I git to feeling like I was a kinder <hi rend="italic">americus</hi> 
myself." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"That ain't fair to your children," said Tilly; 
"you ought to let them know how you feel. 
Then they'd act different." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, I don't know, I don't know. You see, 
miss, they're so sure they know better'n me. 
Say, Mrs. Louder, be you going to visit relatives 
in Baxter?" 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0185" n="160"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No, ma'am, I'm going to take care of a sick 
lady," said Jane, "it's kinder queer. Her name's 
Ferguson, her &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"For the land's sake!" screamed Mrs. Higbee, 
"why, that's my 'Liza!" She was in a flutter of 
surprise and delight, and so absorbed was Tilly in 
getting her and her unwieldy luggage into the car, 
that Jane's daughter forgot to kiss her mother 
good-by. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Put your arm in <hi rend="italic">quick</hi>," she yelled, as Jane 
essayed to kiss her hand through the window; 
"don't <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> put your arm or your head out of a 
train!" &mdash; the train moved away &mdash; "I do hope she'll 
remember what I told her, and not lend anybody 
money, or come home lugging somebody else's 
baby!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
With such reflections, and an ugly sensation of 
loneliness creeping over her, Tilly went to assure 
Miss Minnie Higbee of her mother's safety. She 
described her reception to Harry Lossing and 
Alma, later. "She really seemed kinder mad at 
me," says Tilly, "seemed to think I was interfering  
somehow. And she hadn't any business to 
feel that way, for <hi rend="italic">she</hi> didn't know how I'd fooled 
her brother with that bird-cage. I guess the poor 
old lady daren't call her soul her own. I'd hate 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0186" n="161"/> 
 
to have my mother that way &mdash; so 'fraid of me. <hi rend="italic">My</hi> 
mother shall go where she pleases, and stay where 
she pleases, and <hi rend="italic">do</hi> as she pleases." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"That makes me think," says Alma, "I heard 
you were going to move." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, we are. Mother is working too hard. 
She knows everybody in the building, and they 
call on her all the time; and I think the easiest 
way out is just to move." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Alma and Mr. Lossing exchanged glances. 
There is an Arabian legend of an angel whose 
trade it is to decipher the language of faces. This 
angel must have perceived that Alma's eyes said, 
with the courage of a second in a duel, "Go on, 
now is the time!" and that Harry's answered, 
with masculine pusillanimity, "I don't like to!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
But he spoke. "Very likely your mother does 
sometimes work too hard," said he. "But don't 
you think it would be harder for her not to work? 
Why, she must have been in the building ever 
since my father bought it; and she's been a janitor 
and a fire inspector and a doctor and a ministering 
angel combined! That is why we never raised the 
rent to you when we improved the building, and 
raised it on the others. My father told me your 
mother was the best paying tenant he ever had. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0187" n="162"/> 
 
And don't you remember how, when I used to 
come with him, when I was a little boy, she used 
to take me in her room while he went the rounds? 
She was always doing good to everybody, the same 
way. She has a heart as big as the Mississippi, 
and I assure you, Miss Louder, you won't make 
her happy, but miserable, if you try to dam up its 
channel. She has often told me that she loved 
the building and all the people in it. They all 
love her. I <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>, Miss Louder, you'll think of 
those things before you decide. She is so unselfish  
that she would go in a minute if she 
thought it would make you happier." The angel 
aforesaid, during this speech (which Harry delivered  
with great energy and feeling), must have 
had all his wits busy on Tilly's impassive features; 
but he could read ardent approval, succeeded by 
indignation, on Alma's countenance, at his first 
glance. The indignation came when Tilly spoke. 
She said: "Thank you, Mr. Lossing, you're very 
kind, I'm sure" &mdash; Harry softly kicked the waste-basket  
under the desk &mdash; "but I guess it's best for 
us to go. I've been thinking about it for six 
months, and I know it will be a hard struggle for 
mother to go; but in a little while she will be glad 
she went. It's only for her sake I am doing it; 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0188" n="163"/> 
 
it ain't an easy or a pleasant thing for me to do, 
either &mdash;" As Tilly stopped her voice was unsteady, 
 and the rare tears shone in her eyes. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"What's best for her is the only question, of 
course," said Alma, helping Harry off the field. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
In a few days Tilly received a long letter from 
her mother. Mr. Ferguson was doing wonders 
for the Russians; the family were all very kind to 
her and "nice folks" and easily pleased. ("Of 
<hi rend="italic">course</hi> they're pleased with mother's cooking; 
what would they be made of if they weren't!" 
cried Tilly.) It was wonderful how much help 
Mrs. Higbee was about the house, and how happy 
it made her. Mrs. Ferguson had seemed real glad 
to see her, and that made her happy. And then, 
maybe it helped a little, her (Jane Louder's) telling  
Mrs. Ferguson ("accidental like") how Tilly 
treated her, never trying to boss her, and letting 
her travel alone. Perhaps, if Mrs. Ferguson kept 
on improving, they might let her come home next 
week. And the letter ended: 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I will be so glad if they do, for I want to see 
you so bad, dear daughter, and I want to see the 
old home once more before we leave. I guess the 
house you tell me about will be very nice and 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0189" n="164"/> 
 
convenient. I do thank you, dear daughter, for 
being so nice and considerate about the Russians. 
Give my love to Mrs. Carleton and all of them; 
and if little Bobby Green hasn't missed school 
since I left, give him a nickel, please; and please 
give that medical student on the fifth floor &mdash; I 
forget his name &mdash; the stockings I mended. They 
are in the first drawer of the walnut bureau. 
Good-by, my dear, good daughter. 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
MOTHER, JANE M. LOUDER." 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
When Tilly read the letter she was surrounded 
by wall-paper and carpet samples. Her eyes grew 
moist before she laid it down; but she set her 
mouth more firmly. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"It is an awful short time, but I've just got to 
hurry and have it over before she comes," said 
she. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Next week Jane returned. She was on the 
train, waiting in her seat in the car, when Captain 
Ferguson handed her Tilly's last letter, which had 
lain in the post-office for three days. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
It was very short: 
 
</p> 
 
 
 
<q><p> "DEAR MOTHER: I shall be very glad indeed 
to see you. I have a surprise which I hope will


 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0190"/> 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0191" n="166"/> 
 
be pleasant for you; anyhow, I truly have meant 
it for your happiness. </p>
 
<p> Your affectionate daughter, </p>
 
 
<p>M. E. LOUDER."</p>  
</q> 
 
 
 
<p> 
There must have been, despite her shrewd 
sense, an obtuse streak in Tilly, else she would 
never have written that letter. Jane read it twice. 
The paper rattled in her hands. "Tilly has moved 
while I was gone," she said; "I never shall live 
in the block again." She dropped her veil over 
her face. She sat very quietly in her seat; but 
the conductor who came for her ticket watched 
her sharply, she seemed so dazed by his demand 
and was so long in finding the ticket. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The train rumbled and hissed through darkening  
cornfields, into scattered yellow lights of low 
houses, into angles of white light of street-arcs 
and shop-windows, into the red and blue lights 
dancing before the engines in the station. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Mother!" cried Tilly's voice. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Jane let her and Harry Lossing take all her 
bundles and lift her out of the car. Whether she 
spoke a word she could not tell. She did rouse 
a little at the vision of the Lossing carriage glittering  
at the street corner; but she had not the 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0192" n="167"/> 
 
sense to thank Harry Lossing, who placed her in 
the carriage and lifted his hat in farewell. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"What's he doing all that for, Tilly?" cried 
she;" there ain't &mdash; there ain't nobody dead &mdash;  
Maria  
Carleton &mdash;" She stared at Tilly wildly. 
</p>

Tilly was oddly moved, though she tried to 
speak lightly. "No, no, there ain't nothing wrong, 
at all. It's because you've done so much for the 
Russians &mdash; and other folks! Now, ma, I'm going 
to be mysterious. You must shut your eyes and 
shut your mouth until I tell you. That's a dear 
ma." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
It was vaguely comforting to have Tilly so 
affectionate. "I'm a wicked, ungrateful woman 
to be so wretched," thought Jane; "I'll never let 
Tilly know how I felt." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
In a surprisingly short time the carriage 
stopped. "Now, ma," said Tilly. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
A great blaze of light seemed all about Jane 
Louder. There were the dear familiar windows of 
the Lossing block. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Come up-stairs, ma," said Tilly. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
She followed like one in a dream; and like one 
in a dream she was pushed into her own old parlor. 
The old parlor, but not quite the old parlor; hung 
with new wall-paper, shining with new paint, soft 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0193" n="168"/> 
 
under her feet with a new carpet, it looked to Jane 
Louder like fairyland. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, Tilly," she gasped; "oh, Tilly, ain't you 
moved?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No, nor we ain't going to move, ma &mdash; that's 
the surprise! I took the money I'd saved for 
moving, for the new carpet and new dishes; and 
the Lossings they papered and painted. I was 
<hi rend="italic">so</hi> 'fraid we couldn't get done in time. Alma and 
all the boarders are coming in pretty soon to welcome  
you, and they've all chipped in for a little 
banquet at Mrs. Carleton's &mdash; why, mother, you're 
crying! Mother, you didn't really think I'd 
move when it made you feel so bad? I know I'm 
set and stubborn, and I didn't take it well when 
Mr. Lossing talked to me; but the more I thought 
it over, the more I seemed to myself like that 
hateful Minnie. Oh, mother, I ain't, am I? You 
shall do just exactly as you like all the days of 
your life!"

<head>AN ASSISTED PROVIDENCE</head> 
 
<p> 
IT was the Christmas turkeys that should be 
held responsible. Every year the Lossings 
give each head of a family in their employ, and 
each lad helping to support his mother, a turkey 
at Christmastide. As the business has grown, so 
has the number of turkeys, until it is now well 
up in the hundreds, and requires a special contract. 
 Harry, one Christmas, some two years 
ago, bought the turkeys at so good a bargain 
that he felt the natural reaction in an impulse 
to extravagance. In the very flood-tide of the 
money-spending yearnings, he chanced to pass 
Deacon Hurst's stables and to see two Saint 
Bernard puppies, of elephantine size but of the 
tenderest age, gambolling on the sidewalk before 
the office. Deacon Hurst, I should explain, is no 
more a deacon than I am; he is a livery-stable 
keeper, very honest, a keen and solemn sportsman, 
 and withal of a staid demeanor and a habitual  
garb of black. Now you know as well as I 
any reason for his nickname. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0195" n="170"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Deacon Hurst is fond of the dog as well as of 
that noble animal the horse (he has three copies 
of "Black Beauty" in his stable, which would do 
an incalculable amount of good if they were ever 
read!); and he usually has half a dozen dogs of 
his own, with pedigrees long enough for a poor 
gentlewoman in a New England village. He told 
Harry that the Saint Bernards were grandsons of 
Sir Bevidere, the "finest dog of his time in the 
world, sir;" that they were perfectly marked and 
very large for their age (which Harry found it 
easy to believe of the young giants), and that 
they were "ridiculous, sir, at the figger of two 
hundred and fifty!" (which Harry did not believe 
so readily); and, after Harry had admired and 
studied the dogs for the space of half an hour, 
he dropped the price, in a kind of spasm of 
generosity, to two hundred dollars. Harry was 
tempted to close the bargain on the spot, hot-headed, 
 but he decided to wait and prepare his 
mother for such a large addition to the stable. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The more he dwelt on the subject the more he 
longed to buy the dogs. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
In fact, a time comes to every healthy man 
when he wants a dog, just as a time comes when 
he wants a wife; and Harry's dog was dead. By 
 
</p> 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0196"/> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0197"/>
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0198" n="173"/> 
 
<p> 
 
consequence, Harry was in the state of sensitive 
affection and desolation to which a promising 
new object makes the most moving appeal. The 
departed dog (Bruce by name) had been a Saint 
Bernard; and Deacon Hurst found one of the 
puppies to have so much the expression of countenance  
of the late Bruce that he named him 
Bruce on the spot &mdash; a little before Harry joined 
the group. Harry did not at first recognize this 
resemblance, but he grew to see it; and, combined  
with the dog's affectionate disposition, it 
softened his heart. By the time he told his 
mother he was come to quoting Hurst's adjectives  
as his own. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Beauties, mother," says Harry, with sparkling 
eyes; "the markings are perfect &mdash; couldn't be 
better; and their heads are shaped just right! 
You can't get such watch-dogs in the world! 
And, for all their enormous strength, gentle as a 
lamb to women and children! And, mother, one 
of them looks like Bruce!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I suppose they would want to be house-dogs, 
" says Mrs. Lossing, a little dubiously, but 
looking fondly at Harry's handsome face; "you 
know, somehow, all our dogs, no matter how 
properly they start in a kennel, end by being so 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0199" n="174"/> 
 
hurt if we keep them there that they come into 
the house. And they are so large, it is like having  
a pet lion about." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"These dogs, mother, shall never put a paw in 
the house." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, I hope just as I get fond of them they 
will not have the distemper and die!" said Mrs. 
Lossing; which speech Harry rightly took for the 
white flag of surrender. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
That evening he went to find Hurst and clinch 
the bargain. As it happened, Hurst was away, 
driving an especially important political personage  
to an especially important political council. 
The day following was a Sunday; but, by this 
time, Harry was so bent upon obtaining the dogs 
that he had it in mind to go to Hurst's house for 
them in the afternoon. When Harry wants anything, 
 from Saint Bernards to purity in politics, 
he wants it with an irresistible impetus! If he 
did wrong, his error was linked to its own punishment. 
 But this is anticipating, if not presuming; 
I prefer to leave Harry Lossing's experience to 
paint its own moral without pushing. The event 
that happened next was Harry's pulling out his 
check-book and beginning to write a check, remarking, 
 with a slight drooping of his eyelids, 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0200" n="175"/> 
 
"Best catch the deacon's generosity on the fly, or 
it may make a home run!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Then he let the pen fall on the blotter, for he 
had remembered the day. After an instant's 
hesitation he took a couple of hundred-dollar 
bank-notes out of a drawer (I think they were 
gifts for his two sisters on Christmas day, for he 
is a generous brother; and most likely there 
would be some small domestic joke about engravings  
to go with them); these he placed in the 
right-hand pocket of his waistcoat. In his left-hand  
waistcoat pocket were two five-dollar notes. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Harry was now arrayed for church. He was a 
figure to please any woman's eye, thought his 
mother, as she walked beside him, and gloried 
silently in his six feet of health and muscle and 
dainty cleanliness. He was in a most amiable 
mood, what with the Saint Bernards and the season. 
 As they approached the cathedral close, 
Harry, not for the first time, admired the pure 
Gothic lines of the cathedral, and the soft blending  
of grays in the stone with the warmer hues 
of the brown network of Virginia creeper that 
still fluttered, a remnant of the crimson adornings 
of autumn. Beyond were the bare, square outlines  
of the old college, with a wooden cupola 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0201" n="176"/> 
 
perched on the roof, like a little hat on a fat 
man, the dull-red tints of the professors' houses, 
and the withered lawns and bare trees. The 
turrets and balconies and arched windows of the 
boys' school displayed a red background for a 
troop of gray uniforms and blazing buttons; the 
boys were forming to march to church. Opposite 
the boys' school stood the modest square brick 
house that had served the first bishop of the 
diocese during laborious years. Now it was the 
dean's residence. Facing it, just as you approached  
the cathedral, the street curved into a 
half-circle on either side, and in the centre the 
granite soldier on his shaft looked over the city 
that would honor him. Harry saw the tall figure 
of the dean come out of his gate, the long black 
skirts of his cassock fluttering under the wind of 
his big steps. Beside him skipped and ran, to 
keep step with him, a little man in ill-fitting black, 
of whose appearance, thus viewed from the rear, 
one could only observe stooping shoulders and 
iron-gray hair that curled at the ends. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"He must be the poor missionary who built 
his church himself," Mrs. Lossing observed; "he 
is not much of a preacher, the dean said, but he 
is a great worker and a good pastor." 
 
</p> 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0202"/> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0203"/> 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0204" n="179"/> 
 
 
<p> 
"So much the better for his people, and the 
worse for us!" says Harry, cheerfully. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Why?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Naturally. We shall get the poor sermon and 
they will get the good pastoring!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Then Harry caught sight of a woman's frock 
and a profile that he knew, and thought no more 
of the preacher, whoever he might be. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
But he was in the chancel in plain view, after 
the procession of choir-boys had taken their seats. 
He was an elderly man with thin cheeks and a 
large nose. He had one of those great, orotund 
voices that occasionally roll out of little men, 
and he read the service with a misjudged effort 
to fill the building. The building happened to 
have peculiarly fine acoustic properties; but the 
unfortunate man roared like him of Bashan. 
There was nothing of the customary ecclesiastical  
dignity and monotony about his articulation; 
indeed, it grew plain and plainer to Harry that 
he must have "come over" from some franker 
and more emotional denomination. It seemed 
quite out of keeping with his homely manner 
and crumpled surplice that this particular reader 
should intone. Intone, nevertheless, he did; and 
as badly as mortal man well could! It was not 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0205" n="180"/> 
 
so much that his voice or his ear went wrong; 
he would have had a musical voice of the heavy 
sort, had he not bellowed; neither did his ear 
betray him; the trouble seemed to be that he 
could not decide when to begin; now he began 
too early, and again, with a startled air, he began 
too late, as if he had forgotten. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I hope he will not preach," thought Harry, 
who was absorbed in a rapt contemplation of his 
sweetheart's back hair. He came back from a 
tender revery (by way of a little detour into the 
furniture business and the establishment that a 
man of his income could afford) to the church and 
the preacher and his own sins, to find the strange 
clergyman in the pulpit, plainly frightened, and 
bawling more loudly than ever under the influence 
of fear. He preached a sermon of wearisome 
platitudes; making up for lack of thought by 
repetition, and shouting himself red in the face 
to express earnestness. "Fourth-class Methodist 
effort," thought the listener in the Lossing pew, 
stroking his fair mustache, "with Episcopal decorations! 
 That man used to be a Methodist minister, 
 and he was brought into the fold by a high-churchman. 
 Poor fellow, the Methodist church 
polity has a place for such fellows as he; but he 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0206" n="181"/> 
 
is a stray sheep with us. He doesn't half catch 
on to the motions; yet I'll warrant he is proud of 
that sermon, and his wife thinks it one of the 
great efforts of the century." Here Harry took 
a short rest from the sermon, to contemplate the 
amazing moral phenomenon: how robust can be 
a wife's faith in a commonplace husband! 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Now, this man," reflected Harry, growing 
interested in his own fancies, "this man never 
can have <hi rend="italic">lived!</hi> He doesn't know what it is to 
suffer, he has only vegetated! Doubtless, in a 
prosaic way, he loves his wife and children; but 
can a fellow who talks like him have any delicate  
sympathies or any romance about him? He 
looks honest; I think he is a right good fellow 
and works like a soldier; but to be so stupid as 
he is, ought to <hi rend="italic">hurt!"</hi> 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Harry felt a whimsical moving of sympathy 
towards the preacher. He wondered why he continually  
made gestures with the left arm, never 
with his right. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"It gives a one-sided effect to his eloquence," 
said he. But he thought that he understood 
when an unguarded movement revealed a rent 
which had been a mended place in the surplice. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Poor fellow," said Harry. He recalled how, 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0207" n="182"/> 
 
as a boy, he had gone to a fancy-dress ball in 
Continental smallclothes, so small that he had 
been strictly cautioned by his mother and sisters 
not to bow except with the greatest care, lest he 
rend his magnificence and reveal that it was too 
tight to allow an inch of underclothing. The 
stockings, in particular, had been short, and his 
sister had providently sewed them on to the 
knee-breeches, and to guard against accidents still 
further, had pinned as well as sewed, the pins 
causing Harry much anguish. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Poor fellow!" said Harry again, "I wonder 
is <hi rend="italic">he</hi> pinned somewhere? I feel like giving him 
a lift; he is so prosy it isn't likely anyone else 
will feel moved to help." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Thus it came about that when the dean announced  
that the alms this day would be given to 
the parish of our friend who had just addressed 
us; and the plate paused before the Lossing pew, 
Harry slipped his hand into his waistcoat pocket 
after those two five-dollar notes. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
I should explain that Harry being a naturally 
left-handed boy, who has laboriously taught himself  
the use of his right hand, it is a family joke 
that he is like the inhabitants of Nineveh, who 
could not tell their right hand from their left. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0208" n="183"/> 
 
But Harry himself has always maintained that he 
can tell as well as the next man. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Out drifted the flock of choir-boys singing, 
"For thee, oh dear, dear country," and presently, 
following them, out drifted the congregation; 
among the crowd the girl that Harry loved, not 
so quickly that he had not time for a look and a 
smile (just tinged with rose); and because she was 
so sweet, so good, so altogether adorable, and 
because she had not only smiled but blushed, and, 
unobserved, he had touched the fur of her jacket, 
the young man walked on air. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He did not remember the Saint Bernards until 
after the early Sunday dinner, and during the 
after-dinner cigar. He was sitting in the library, 
before some blazing logs, at peace with all the 
world. To him, thus, came his mother and announced  
that the dean and "that man who 
preached this morning, you know," were waiting 
in the other room. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"They seem excited," said she, "and talk 
about your munificence. What <hi rend="italic">have</hi> you been 
doing?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Appear to make a great deal of fuss over ten 
dollars," said Harry, lightly, as he sauntered out 
of the door. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0209" n="184"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The dean greeted him with something almost 
like confusion in his cordiality; he introduced his 
companion as the Rev. Mr. Gilling. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Mr. Gilling could not feel easy until he 
had &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Made sure about there being no mistake," 
interrupted Mr. Gilling; "I &mdash; the sum was so 
great &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
A ghastly suspicion shot like a fever-flush over 
Harry's mind. Could it be possible? There were 
the two other bills; could he have given one of 
them? Given that howling dervish a hundred 
dollars? The thought was too awful! 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"It was really not enough for you to trouble 
yourself," he said; "I dare say you are thanking 
the wrong man." He felt he must say something. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
To his surprise the dean colored, while the 
other clergyman answered, in all simplicity: 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No, sir, no, sir. I know very well. The only 
other bill, except dollars, on the plate, the dean 
here gave, and the warden remembers that you 
put in two notes &mdash; I" &mdash; he grew quite pale &mdash; "I 
can't help thinking you maybe intended to put 
in only <hi rend="italic">one!</hi> "His voice broke, he tried to control  
it. "The sum is so <hi rend="italic">very</hi> large!" quavered 
he. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0210" n="185"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I have given him <hi rend="italic">both</hi> bills, two hundred 
dollars!" thought Harry. He sat down. He 
was accustomed to read men's faces, and plainly 
as ever he had read, he could read the signs of 
distress and conflict on the prosaic, dull features 
before him. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I <hi rend="italic">intended</hi> to put in two bills," said he. Gilling  
gave a little gasp &mdash; so little, only a quick ear 
could have caught it; but Harry's ear is quick. 
He twisted one leg around the other, a further 
sign of deliverance of mind. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, sir, well, Mr. Lossing," he remarked, 
clearing his throat, "I cannot express to you 
properly the &mdash; the appreciation I have of your &mdash;  
your  
<hi rend="italic">princely</hi> gift!" (Harry changed a groan into 
a cough and tried to smile.) "I would like to 
ask you, however, <hi rend="italic">how</hi> you would like it to be 
divided. There are a number of worthy causes: 
the furnishing of the church, which is in charge 
of the Ladies' Aid Society; they are very hard 
workers, the ladies of our church. And there is 
the Altar Guild, which has the keeping of the 
altar in order. They are mostly young girls, 
and they used to wash my things &mdash; I mean the 
vestments" (blushing) &mdash; "but they &mdash; they were so 
young they were not careful, and my wife thought 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0211" n="186"/> 
 
she had best wash the &mdash; vestments herself, but she 
allowed them to laundry the other &mdash; ah, things." 
There was the same discursiveness in his talk as 
in his sermon, Harry thought; and the same 
uneasy restlessness of manner. "Then, we give 
to &mdash; various causes, and &mdash; and there is, also, my 
own salary &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"That is what it was intended for," said Harry. 
"I hope the two hundred dollars will be of some 
use to you, and then, indirectly, it will help your 
church." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Harry surprised a queer glance from the dean's 
brown eyes; there was both humor and a something  
else that was solemn enough in it. The 
dean had believed that there was a mistake. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"All of it! To <hi rend="italic">me!"</hi> cried Gilling. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"All of it. To <hi rend="italic">you</hi>," Harry replied, dryly. He 
was conscious of the dean's gaze upon him. "I 
had a sudden impulse," said he, "and I gave it; 
that is all." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The tears rose to the clergyman's eyes; he 
tried to wink them away, then he tried to brush 
them away with a quick rub of his fingers, then 
he sprang up and walked to the window, his back 
to Harry. Directly he was facing the young man 
again, and speaking. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0212" n="187"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"You must excuse me, Mr. Lossing; since my 
sickness a little thing upsets me." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Mr. Gilling had diphtheria last spring," the 
dean struck in, "there was an epidemic of diphtheria, 
 in Matin's Junction; Mr. Gilling really 
saved the place; but his wife and he both contracted  
the disease, and his wife nearly died." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Harry remembered some story that he had 
heard at the time &mdash; his eyes began to light up as 
they do when he is moved. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Why, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are the man that made them disinfect  
their houses," cried he, "and invented a 
little oven or something to steam mattresses and 
things. You are the man that nursed them and 
buried them when the undertaker died. You 
digged graves with your own hands &mdash; I say, I 
should like to shake hands with you!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Gilling shook hands, submissively, but looking 
bewildered. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He cleared his throat. "Would you mind, Mr. 
Lossing, if I took up your time so far as to tell 
you what so overcame me?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I should be glad &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"You see, sir, my wife was the daughter of 
the Episcopal minister &mdash; I mean the rector, at the 
town &mdash; well, it wasn't a town, it was two or three 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0213" n="188"/> 
 
towns off in Shelby County where I had my circuit. 
 You may be surprised, sir, to know that I 
was once a Methodist minister." 
 
 
</p> 
 

 
<p> 
"Is it possible?" said Harry. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, sir. Her father &mdash; my wife's, I mean &mdash;  
was  
about as high a churchman as he could be, 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0214" n="189"/> 
 
and be married. He induced me to join our communion; 
 and very soon after I was married. I 
hope, Mr. Lossing, you'll come and see us some 
time, and see my wife. She &mdash; are you married?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I am not so fortunate." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"A good wife cometh from the Lord, sir, <hi rend="italic">sure!</hi> 
I thought I appreciated mine, but I guess I didn't. 
She had two things she wanted, and one I did 
want myself; but the other &mdash; I couldn't seem to 
bring my mind to it, no &mdash; anyhow! We hadn't 
any children but one that died four years ago, a 
little baby. Ever since she died my wife has had 
a longing to have a stained-glass window, with the 
picture, you know, of Christ blessing little children, 
 put into our little church. In Memoriam, 
you know. Seems as if, now we've lost the baby, 
we think all the more of the church. Maybe she 
was a sort of idol to us. Yes, sir, that's one thing 
my wife fairly longed for. We've saved our money, 
what we <hi rend="italic">could</hi> save; there are so many calls; during  
the sickness, last winter, the sick needed so 
many things, and it didn't seem right for us to 
neglect them just for our baby's window; and &mdash;  
the  
money went. The other thing was different. 
My wife has got it into her head I have a fine 
voice. And she's higher church than I am; so 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0215" n="190"/> 
 
she has always wanted me to <hi rend="italic">intone</hi>. I told her 
I'd look like a fool intoning, and there's no mistake  
about it, I <hi rend="italic">do</hi>! But she couldn't see it that 
way. It was 'most the only point wherein we 
differed; and last spring, when she was so sick, 
and I didn't know but I'd lose her, it was dreadful  
to me to think how I'd crossed her. So, Mr. 
Lossing, when she got well I promised her, for a 
thank-offering, I'd intone. And I have ever since. 
My people know me so well, and we've been 
through so much together, that they didn't make 
any fuss &mdash; though they are not high &mdash; fact is, I'm 
not high myself. But they were kind and considerate, 
 and I got on pretty well at home; but 
when I came to rise up in that great edifice, before  
that cultured and intellectual audience, so 
finely dressed, it did seem to me I could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> do 
it! I was sorely tempted to break my promise. 
I was, for a fact." He drew a long breath. "I 
just had to pray for grace, or I never would have 
pulled through. I had the sermon my wife likes 
best with me; but I know it lacks &mdash; it lacks &mdash; it 
isn't what you need! I was dreadfully scared and 
I felt miserable when I got up to preach it &mdash; and 
then to think that you were &mdash; but it is the Lord's 
doing and marvellous in our eyes! I don't know 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0216" n="191"/> 
 
what Maggie will say when I tell her we can get 
the window. The best she hoped was I'd bring 
back enough so the church could pay me eighteen 
dollars they owe on my salary. And now &mdash; it's 
wonderful! Why, Mr. Lossing, I've been thinking  
so much and wanting so to get that window 
for her, that, hearing the dean wanted some carpentering  
done, I thought maybe, as I'm a fair 
carpenter &mdash; that was my trade once, sir &mdash; I'd ask 
him to let <hi rend="italic">me</hi> do the job. I was aware there is 
nothing in our rules &mdash; I mean our canons &mdash; to prevent  
me, and nobody need know I was the rector 
of Matin's Junction, because I would come just in 
my overalls. There is a cheap place where I could 
lodge, and I could feed myself for almost nothing, 
living is so cheap. I was praying about that, too. 
Now, your noble generosity will enable me to 
donate what they owe on my salary, and get the 
window too!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Take my advice," said Harry, "donate nothing. 
 Say nothing about this gift; I will take care 
of the warden, and I can answer for the dean." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes," said the dean, "on the whole, Gilling, 
you would better say nothing, I think; Mr. Lossing  
is more afraid of a reputation for generosity 
than of the small-pox." 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0217" n="192"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The older man looked at Harry with glistening 
eyes of admiration; with what Christian virtues 
 
</p> 
 

 
<p> 
 
of humility he was endowing that embarrassed 
young man, it is painful to imagine. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0218" n="193"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The dean's eyes twinkled above his handkerchief, 
 which hid his mouth, as he rose to make his 
farewells. He shook hands, warmly. "God bless 
you, Harry," said he. Gilling, too, wrung Harry's 
hands; he was seeking some parting word of gratiude, 
 but he could only choke out, "I hope you 
will get <hi rend="italic">married</hi> some time, Mr. Lossing, then 
you'll understand." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well," said Harry, as the door closed, and he 
flung out his arms and his chest in a huge sigh, 
"I do believe it was better than the puppies!"

<head>HARRY LOSSING</head> 
 
<p> 
THE note-book of Mr. Horatio Armorer, president  
of our street railways, contained a 
page of interest to some people in our town, on 
the occasion of his last visit. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He wrote it while the train creaked over the 
river, and the porter of his Pullman car was 
brushing all the dust that had been distributed 
on the passengers' clothing, into the main aisle. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
If you had seen him writing it (with a stubby 
little pencil that he occasionally brightened with 
the tip of his tongue), you would not have 
dreamed him to be more profoundly disturbed 
than he had been in years. Nor would the page 
itself have much enlightened you. 
 
<lb/> 
 
<q> 
<hi rend="italic">"See abt road M&mdash; D&mdash;<lb/> 
See E &amp; M tea-set<lb/> 
See abt L</hi>." 
</q> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Translated into long-hand, this reads: "See 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0220" n="195"/> 
 
about the street-car road, Marston (the superintendent) 
 and Dane (the lawyer). See Lossing, 
see Esther and Maggie, and remember about 
tea-set. See about Lossing." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
His memoranda written, he slipped the book in 
his pocket, reflecting cynically, "There's habit! 
I've no need of writing that. It's not pleasant 
enough to forget!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Thirty odd years ago, Horatio Armorer &mdash; they 
called him 'Raish, then &mdash; had left the town to 
seek his fortune in Chicago. It was his day-dream  
to wrestle a hundred thousand dollars out 
of the world's tight fists, and return to live in 
pomp on Brady Street hill! He should drive a 
buggy with two horses, and his wife should keep 
two girls. Long ago, the hundred thousand limit 
had been reached and passed, next the million; 
and still he did not return. His father, the Presbyterian  
minister, left his parish, or, to be exact, 
was gently propelled out of his parish by the 
disaffected; the family had a new home; and the 
son, struggling to help them out of his scanty 
resources, went to the new parish and not to the 
old. He grew rich, he established his brothers 
and sisters in prosperity, he erected costly monuments  
and a memorial church to his parents (they 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0221" n="196"/> 
 
were beyond any other gifts from him); he married, 
 and lavished his money on three daughters; 
but the home of his youth neither saw him nor 
his money until Margaret Ellis bought a house on 
Brady Street, far up town, where she could have 
all the grass that she wanted. Mrs. Ellis was a 
widow and rich. Not a millionaire like her 
brother, but the possessor of a handsome property. 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
She was the best-natured woman in the world, 
and never guessed how hard her neighbors found 
it to forgive her for always calling their town of 
thirty thousand souls, "the country." She said 
that she had pined for years to live in the 
country, and have horses, and a Jersey cow and 
chickens, and "a neat pig." All of which modest 
cravings she gratified on her little estate; and the 
gardener was often seen with a scowl and the 
garden hose, keeping the pig neat. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
It was later that Mr. Armorer had bought the 
street railways, they having had a troublous history  
and being for sale cheap. Nobody that 
knows Armorer as a business man would back his 
sentiment by so much as an old shoe; yet it was 
sentiment, and not a good bargain, that had enticed  
the financier. Once engaged, the instincts 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0222" n="197"/> 
 
of a shrewd trader prompted him to turn it into a 
good bargain, anyhow. His fancy was pleased by 
 
</p> 
 

<p> 
 
a vision of a return to the home of his childhood 
and his struggling youth, as a greater personage 
than his hopes had ever dared promise. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0223" n="198"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
But, in the event, there was little enough 
gratification for his vanity. Not since his wife's 
death had he been so harassed and anxious; for 
he came not in order to view his new property, 
but because his sister had written him her suspicions  
that Harry Lossing wanted to marry his 
youngest daughter. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Armorer arrived in the early dawn. Early as it 
was, a handsome victoria, with horses sleeker of 
skin and harness heavier and brighter than one is 
used to meet outside the great cities, had been in 
waiting for twenty minutes; while for that space 
of time a pretty girl had paced up and down the 
platform. The keenest observer among the 
crowd, airing its meek impatience on the platform, 
 did not detect any sign of anxiety in her 
behavior. She walked erect, with a step that left 
a clean-cut footprint in the dust, as girls are 
trained to walk nowadays. Her tailor-made gown 
of fine blue serge had not a wrinkle. It was so 
simple that only a fashionable woman could guess 
anywhere near the awful sum total which that 
plain skirt, that short jacket, and that severe 
waistcoat had once made on a ruled sheet of 
paper. When she turned her face toward the low, 
red station-house and the people, it looked gentle, 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0224" n="199"/> 
 
and the least in the world sad. She had one of 
those clear olive skins that easily grow pale; 
it was pale to-day. Her black hair was fine as 
spun silk; the coil under her hat-brim shone as 
she moved. The fine hair, the soft, transparent 
skin, and the beautiful marking of her brows were 
responsible for an air of fragile daintiness in her 
person, just as her almond-shaped, liquid dark 
eyes and unsmiling mouth made her look sad. It 
was a most attractive face, in all its moods; sometimes  
it was a beautiful face; yet it did not have 
a single perfect feature except the mouth, which 
&mdash; at least so Harry Lossing told his mother &mdash;  
might  
have been stolen from the Venus of Milo. 
Even the mouth, some critics called too small for 
her nose; but it is as easy to call her nose too 
large for her mouth. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The instant she turned her back on the bustle 
of the station, all the lines in her face seemed to 
waver and the eyes to brighten. Finally, when 
the train rolled up to the platform and a young-looking  
elderly man swung himself nimbly off the 
steps, the color flared up in her cheeks, only to 
sink as suddenly; like a candle flame in a gust of 
wind. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Mr. Armorer put his two arms and his umbrella 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0225" n="200"/> 
 
and travelling-bag about the charming shape in 
blue, at the same time exclaiming, "You're a 
good girl to come out so early, Essie! How's 
Aunt Meg?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, very well. She would have come too, but 
she hasn't come back from training." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Training?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Yes, dear, she has a regular trainer, like John 
L. Sullivan, you know. She drives out to the 
park with Eliza and me, and walks and runs races, 
and does gymnastics. She has lost ten pounds." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Armorer wagged his head with a grin: "I dare 
say. I thought so when you began. Meg is 
always moaning and groaning because she isn't a 
sylph! She will make her cook's life a burden for 
about two months and lose ten pounds, and then 
she will revel in ice-cream! Last time, she was 
raving about Dr. Salisbury and living on beef-steak  
sausages, spending a fortune starving 
herself." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"She had Dr. Salisbury's pamphlet; but 
Cardigan told her it was a long way out; so she 
said she hated to have it do no one any good, and 
she gave it to Maria, one of the maids, who is 
always fretting because she is so thin." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"But the thing was to cure fat people!" 
 
</p> 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0226"/> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0227"/> 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0228" n="203"/> 
 
<p> 
"Precisely." Esther laughed a little low laugh, 
at which her father's eyes shone; "but you see 
she told Maria to exactly reverse the advice and 
eat everything that was injurious to stout people, 
and it would be just right for her." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I perceive," said Armorer, dryly; "very 
ingenious and feminine scheme. But who is 
Cardigan?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Shuey Cardigan? He is the trainer. He is a 
fireman in a furniture shop, now; but he used to 
be the boxing teacher for some Harvard men; 
and he was a distinguished pugilist, once. He 
said to me, modestly, 'I don't suppose you will 
have seen my name in the <hi rend="italic">Police Gazette</hi>, miss?' 
But he really is a very sober, decent man, 
notwithstanding." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Your Aunt Meg always was picking up queer 
birds! Pray, who introduced this decent pugilist?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Esther was getting into the carriage; her face 
was turned from him, but he could see the pink 
deepen in her ear and the oval of her cheek. She 
answered that it was a friend of theirs, Mr. Lossing. 
 As if the name had struck them both dumb, 
neither spoke for a few moments. Armorer bit a 
sigh in two. "Essie," said he, "I guess it is no 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0229" n="204"/> 
 
use to side-track the subject. You know why I 
came here, don't you?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Aunt Meg told me what she wrote to you." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I knew she would. She had compunctions of 
conscience letting him hang round you, until she 
told me; and then she had awful gripes because 
she had told, and had to confess to <hi rend="italic">you!"</hi> 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He continued in a different tone: "Essie, I 
have missed your mother a long while, and 
nobody knows how that kind of missing hurts; 
but it seems to me I never missed her as I do 
to-day. I need her to advise me about you, Essie. 
It is like this: I don't want to be a stern parent 
any more than you want to elope on a rope ladder. 
 We have got to look at this thing together, 
my dear little girl, and try to &mdash; to trust each 
other." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Don't you think, papa," said Esther, smiling 
rather tremulously, "that we would better wait, 
before we have all these solemn preparations, 
until we know surely whether Mr. Lossing wants 
me?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Don't you know surely?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"He has never said anything of &mdash; of that &mdash;  
kind." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, he is in love with you fast enough," 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0230" n="205"/> 
 
growled Armorer; but a smile of intense relief 
brightened his face. "Now, you see, my dear, all 
I know about this young man, except that he 
wants my daughter &mdash; which you will admit is not 
likely to prejudice me in his favor &mdash; is that he is 
mayor of this town and has a furniture store &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"A manufactory; it is a very large business!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"All right, manufactory, then; all the same he 
is not a brilliant match for my daughter, not such 
a husband as your sisters have." Esther's lip 
quivered and her color rose again; but she did 
not speak. "Still I will say that I think a fellow 
who can make his own fortune is better than a 
man with twice that fortune made for him. My 
dear, if Lossing has the right stuff in him and he 
is a real good fellow, I shan't make you go into a 
decline by objecting; but you see it is a big shock 
to me, and you must let me get used to it, and 
let me size the young man up in my own way. 
There is another thing, Esther; I am going to 
Europe Thursday, that will give me just a day in 
Chicago if I go to-morrow, and I wish you would 
come with me. Will you mind?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Either she changed her seat or she started at 
the proposal. But how could she say that she 
wanted to stay in America with a man who had 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0231" n="206"/> 
 
not said a formal word of love to her? "I can 
get ready, I think, papa," said Esther. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
They drove on. He felt a crawling pain in his 
heart, for he loved his daughter Esther as he had 
loved no other child of his; and he knew that he 
had hurt her. Naturally, he grew the more angry 
at the impertinent young man who was the cause 
of the flitting; for the whole European plan had 
been cooked up since the receipt of Mrs. Ellis's 
letter. They were on the very street down which 
he used to walk (for it takes the line of the hills) 
when he was a poor boy, a struggling, ferociously 
ambitious young man. He looked at the changed 
rows of buildings, and other thoughts came 
uppermost for a moment. "It was here father's 
church used to stand; it's gone, now," he said. 
"It was a wood church, painted a kind of gray; 
mother had a bonnet the same color, and she used 
to say she matched the church. I bought it with 
the very first money I earned. Part of it came 
from weeding, and the weather was warm, and I 
can feel the way my back would sting and creak, 
now! I would want to stop, often, but I thought 
of mother in church with that bonnet, and I kept 
on! There's the place where Seeds, the grocer 
that used to trust us, had his store; it was his 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0232" n="207"/> 
 
children had the scarlet fever, and mother went 
to nurse them. My! but how dismal it was at 
home! We always got more whippings when 
mother was away. Your grandfather was a good 
man, too honest for this world, and he loved 
every one of his seven children; but he brought 
us up to fear him and the Lord. We feared him 
the most, because the Lord couldn't whip us! 
He never whipped us when we did anything, but 
waited until next day, that he might not punish 
in anger; so we had all the night to anticipate it. 
Did I ever tell you of the time he caught me in a 
lie? I was lame for a week after it. He never 
caught me in another lie." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I think he was cruel; I can't help it, papa," 
cried Esther, with whom this was an old argument, 
 "still it did good, that time!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, no, he wasn't cruel, my dear," said Armorer, with  
a queer smile that seemed to take 
only one-half of his face, not answering the last 
words; "he was too sure of his interpretation of 
the Scripture, that was all. Why, that man just 
slaved to educate us children; he'd have gone to 
the stake rejoicing to have made sure that we 
should be saved. And of the whole seven only 
one is a church member. Is that the road?" 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0233" n="208"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
They could see a car swinging past, on a parallel  
street, its bent pole hitching along the trolley-wire. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Pretty scrubby-looking cars," commented Armorer; 
 "but get our new ordinance through the 
council, we can save enough to afford some fine 
new cars. Has Lossing said anything to you 
about the ordinance and our petition to be allowed  
to leave off the conductors?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"He hasn't said anything, but I read about it 
in the papers. Is it so very important that it 
should be passed?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Saving money is always important, my dear," 
said Armorer, seriously. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The horses turned again. They were now opposite  
a fair lawn and a house of wood and stone 
built after the old colonial pattern, as modern 
architects see it. Esther pointed, saying: 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Aunt Meg's, papa; isn't it pretty?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Very handsome, very fine," said the financier, 
who knew nothing about architecture, except its 
exceeding expense. "Esther, I've a notion; if 
that young man of yours has brains and is fond 
of you he ought to be able to get my ordinance 
through his little eight by ten city council. There 
is our chance to see what stuff he is made of!" 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0234" n="209"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, he has a great deal of influence," said 
Esther; "he can do it, unless &mdash; unless he thinks 
the ordinance would be bad for the city, you 
know." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Confound the modern way of educating 
girls!" thought Armorer. "Now, it would have 
been enough for Esther's mother to know that 
anything was for my interests; it wouldn't have 
to help all out-doors, too!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
But instead of enlarging on this point, he went 
into a sketch of the improvements the road could 
make with the money saved by the change, and 
was waxing eloquent when a lady of a pleasant 
and comely face, and a trig though not slender 
figure, advanced to greet them. 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
It was after breakfast (and the scene was the 
neat pig's pen, where Armorer was displaying his 
ignorance of swine) that he found his first chance 
to talk with his sister alone. "Oh, first, Sis," 
said he, "about your birthday, to-day; I telegraphed  
to Tiffany's for that silver service, you 
know, that you liked, so you needn't think there's 
a mistake when it comes." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, 'Raish, that gorgeous thing! I must kiss 
you, if Daniel does see me!" 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0235" n="210"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, that's all right," said Armorer, hastily, 
and began to talk of the pig. Suddenly, without 
looking up, he dropped into the pig-pen the remark: 
 "I'm very much obliged to you for writing 
me, Meg." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I don't know whether to feel more like a 
virtuous sister or a villanous aunt," sighed Mrs. 
Ellis; "things seemed to be getting on so rapidly 
that it didn't seem right, Esther visiting me and 
all, not to give you a hint; still, I am sure that 
nothing has been said, and it is horrid for Esther, 
perfectly <hi rend="italic">horrid</hi>, discussing her proposals that 
haven't been proposed!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I don't want them ever to be proposed," said 
Armorer, gloomily. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I know you always said you didn't want 
Esther to marry; but I thought if she fell in love 
with the right man &mdash; we know that marriage is a 
very happy estate, sometimes, Horatio!" She 
sighed again. In her case it was only the memory 
of happiness, for Colonel Ellis had been dead these 
twelve years; but his widow mourned him still. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"If you marry the right one, maybe," answered 
Armorer, grudgingly; "but see here, Meg, Esther 
is different from the other girls; they got married 
when Jenny was alive to look after them, and I 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0236" n="211"/> 
 
knew the men, and they were both big matches, 
you know. Then, too, I was so busy making 
money while the other girls grew up that I hadn't 
time to get real well acquainted with them. I 
don't think they ever kissed me, except when 
I gave them a check. But Esther and I &mdash;" 
he drummed with his fingers on the boards, his 
thin, keen face wearing a look that would have 
amazed his business acquaintances &mdash; "you remember  
when her mother died, Meg? Only 
fifteen, and how she took hold of things! And 
we have been together ever since, and she makes 
me think of her grandmother and her mother 
both. She's never had a wish I knew that I 
haven't granted &mdash; why, d&mdash; it! I've bought my 
clothes to please her &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"That's why you are become so well-dressed, 
Horatio; I wondered how you came to spruce up 
so!" interrupted Mrs. Ellis. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"It has been so blamed lonesome whenever she 
went to visit you, but yet I wouldn't say a word 
because I knew what a good time she had; but if 
I had known that there was a confounded, long-legged, 
 sniffy young idiot all that while trying to 
steal my daughter away from me!" In an access 
of wrath at the idea Armorer wrenched off the 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0237" n="212"/> 
 
picket that he clutched, at which he laughed and 
stuck his hands in his pockets. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Why, Meg, the papers and magazines are always  
howling that women won't marry," cried he, 
with a fresh sense of grievance; "now, two of my 
girls have married, that's enough; there was no 
reason for me to expect any more of them would! 
There isn't one d&mdash; bit of need for Esther to 
marry!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"But if she loves the young fellow and he loves 
her, won't you let them be happy?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"He won't make her happy." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"He is a very good fellow, truly and really, 
'Raish. And he comes of a good family &mdash;"

"I don't care for his family; and as to his being 
moral and all that, I know several young fellows 
that could skin him alive in a bargain that are 
moral as you please. I have been a moral man, 
myself. But the trouble with this Lossing (I told 
Esther I didn't know anything about him, but I 
do), the trouble with him is that he is chock 
full of all kinds of principles! Just as father was. 
Don't you remember how he lost parish after 
parish because he couldn't smooth over the big 
men in them? Lossing is every bit as pig-headed. 
I am not going to have my daughter lead the kind 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0238" n="213"/> 
 
of life my mother did. I want a son-in-law who 
ain't going to think himself so much better than I 
am, and be rowing me for my way of doing business. 
 If Esther <hi rend="italic">must</hi> marry I'd like her to marry 
a man with a head on him that I can take into 
business, and who will be willing to live with the 
old man. This Lossing has got his notions of 
making a sort of Highland chief affair of the labor 
question, and we should get along about as well 
as the Kilkenny cats!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Mrs. Ellis knew more than Esther about Armorer's  
business methods, having the advantage of 
her husband's point of view; and Colonel Ellis 
had kept the army standard of honor as well as 
the army ignorance of business. To counterbalance, 
 she knew more than anyone alive what 
a good son and brother Horatio had always 
been. But she could not restrain a smile at the 
picture of the partnership. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Precisely, you see yourself," said Armorer. 
"Meg" &mdash; hesitating &mdash; "you don't suppose it would 
be any use to offer Esther a cool hundred thousand  
to promise to bounce this young fellow?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Horatio, <hi rend="italic">no!"</hi> cried Mrs. Ellis, tossing her 
pretty gray head indignantly; "you'd insult 
her!" 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0239" n="214"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Take it the same way, eh? Well, perhaps; 
Essie has high-toned notions. That's all right, it 
is the thing for women. Mother had them too. 
Look here, Meg, I'll tell you, I want to see if this 
young fellow has <hi rend="italic">any</hi> sense! We have an ordinance  
that we want passed. If he will get his 
council to pass it, that will show he can put his 
grand theories into his pockets sometimes; and I 
will give him a show with Esther. If he doesn't 
care enough for my girl to oblige her father, even 
if he doesn't please a lot of carping roosters that 
want the earth for their town and would like a 
street railway to be run to accommodate them 
and lose money for the stockholders, well, then, 
you can't blame me if I don't want him! Now, 
will you do one thing for me, Meg, to help me 
out? I don't want Lossing to persuade Esther 
to commit herself; you know how, when she was 
a little mite, if Esther gave her word she kept it. 
I want you to promise me you won't let Esther 
be alone one second with young Lossing. She is 
going to-morrow, but there's your whist-party 
to-night; I suppose he's coming? And I want 
you to promise you won't let him have our address. 
 If he treats me square, he won't need to 
ask you for it. Well?" 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0240" n="215"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He buttoned up his coat and folded his arms, 
waiting. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Mrs. Ellis's sympathy had gone out to the 
young people as naturally as water runs down 
hill; for she is of a romantic temperament, 
though she doesn't dare to be weighed. But 
she remembered the silver service, the coffee-pot, 
the tea-pot, the tray for spoons, the creamer, the 
hot-water kettle, the sugar-bowl, all on a rich 
salver, splendid, dazzling; what rank ingratitude 
it would be to oppose her generous brother! 
Rather sadly she answered, but she did answer: 
"I'll do that much for you, 'Raish, but I feel 
we're risking Esther's happiness, and I can only 
keep the letter of my promise." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"That's all I ask, my dear," said Armorer, 
taking out a little shabby note-book from his 
breast-pocket, and scratching out a line. The 
line effaced read: 
 
</p> 
 
<q> 
 
 
<hi rend="italic">"See E &amp; M tea-set</hi>." 
 
</q> 
 
<p> 
"The silver service was a good muzzle," he 
thought. He went away for an interview with 
the corporation lawyer and the superintendent 
of the road, leaving Mrs. Ellis in a distraction of 
conscience that made her the wonder of her servants 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0241" n="216"/> 
 
that morning, during all the preparations 
for the whist-party. She might have felt more 
remorseful had she guessed her brother's real plan. 
He knew enough of Lossing to be assured that 
he would not yield about the ordinance, which he 
firmly believed to be a dangerous one for the city. 
He expected, he counted on the mayor's refusing 
his proffers. He hoped that Esther would feel 
the sympathy which women give, without question  
generally, to the business plans of those near 
and dear to them, taking it for granted that the 
plans are right because they will advantage those 
so near and dear. That was the beautiful and 
proper way that Jenny had always reasoned; why 
should Jenny's daughter do otherwise? When 
Harry Lossing should oppose her father and refuse  
to please him and to win her, mustn't any 
high-spirited woman feel hurt? Certainly she 
must; and he would take care to whisk her off 
to Europe before the young man had a chance to 
make his peace! "Yes, sir," says Armorer, to his 
only confidant, "you never were a domestic conspirator  
before, Horatio, but you have got it 
down fine! You would do for Gaboriau" &mdash; 
Gaboriau's novels being the only fiction that 
ever Armorer read. Nevertheless, his conscience 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0242" n="217"/> 
 
pricked him almost as sharply as his sister's 
pricked her. Consciences are queer things; like 
certain crustaceans, they grow shells in spots; 
and, proof against moral artillery in one part, they 
may be soft as a baby's cheek in another. Armorer's  
conscience had two sides, business and 
domestic; people abused him for a business buccaneer, 
 at the same time his private life was pure, 
and he was a most tender husband and father. 
He had never deceived Esther before in her life. 
Once he had ridden all night in a freight-car to 
keep a promise that he had made the child. It 
hurt him to be hoodwinking her now. But 
he was too angry and too frightened to cry 
back. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The interview with the lawyer did not take any 
long time, but he spent two hours with the superintendent  
of the road, who pronounced him "a 
little nice fellow with no airs about him. Asked 
a power of questions about Harry Lossing; guess 
there is something in that story about Lossing 
going to marry his daughter!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Marston drove him to Lossing's office and left 
him there. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He was on the ground, and Marston lifting the 
whip to touch the horse, when he asked: "Say, 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0243" n="218"/> 
 
before you go &mdash; is there any danger in leaving off 
the conductors?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Marston was raised on mules, and he could 
not overcome a vehement distrust of electricity. 
"Well," said he, "I guess you want the cold 
facts. The children are almighty thick down 
on Third Street, and children are always trying 
to see how near they can come to being killed, 
you know, sir; and then, the old women like to 
come and stand on the track and ask questions 
of the motorneer on the other track, so that 
the car coming down has a chance to catch 'em. 
The two together keep the conductors on the 
jump!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Is that so?" said Armorer, musingly; "well, 
I guess you'd better close with that insurance man 
and get the papers made out before we run the 
new way." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"If we ever do run!" muttered the superintendent  
to himself as he drove away. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Armorer ran his sharp eye over the buildings of 
the Lossing Art Furniture Manufacturing Company, 
 from the ugly square brick box that was 
the nucleus &mdash; the egg, so to speak &mdash; from which 
the great concern had been hatched, to the handsome  
new structures with their great arched windows 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0244" n="219"/> 
 
and red mortar. "Pretty property, very 
pretty property," thought Armorer; "wonder if 
that story Marston tells is true!" The story was 
to the effect that a few weeks before his last sickness  
the older Lossing had taken his son to look 
at the buildings, and said, "Harry, this will all be 
yours before long. It is a comfort to me to think 
that every workman I have is the better, not the 
worse, off for my owning it; there's no blood or 
dirt on my money; and I leave it to you to keep 
it clean and to take care of the men as well as the 
business." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Now, wasn't he a d&mdash; fool!" said Armorer, 
cheerfully, taking out his note-book to mark, 
 
</p> 
 
<q> 
 
 <hi rend="italic">"See abt road M&mdash; D&mdash;"</hi> 
 
</q> 
 
<p> 
And he went in. Harry greeted him with 
exceeding cordiality and a fine blush. Armorer 
explained that he had come to speak to him about 
the proposed street-car ordinances; he (Armorer) 
always liked to deal with principals and without 
formality; now, couldn't they come, representing 
the city and the company, to some satisfactory 
compromise? Thereupon he plunged into the 
statistics of the earnings and expenses of the road 
(with the aid of his note-book), and made the 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0245" n="220"/> 
 
absolute necessity of retrenchment plain. Meanwhile, 
 as he talked he studied the attentive 
listener before him; and Harry, on his part, made 
quite as good use of his eyes. Armorer saw a 
tall, athletic, fair young man, very carefully, 
almost foppishly dressed, with bright, steady blue 
eyes and a firm chin, but a smile under his mustache  
like a child's; it was so sunny and so quick. 
Harry saw a neat little figure in a perfectly fitting 
gray check travelling suit, with a rose in the buttonhole  
of the coat lapel. Armorer wore no 
jewellery except a gold ring on the little finger of 
his right hand, from which he had taken the glove 
the better to write. Harry knew that it was his 
dead wife's wedding-ring; and noticed it with a 
little moving of the heart. The face that he saw 
was pale but not sickly, delicate and keen. A 
silky brown mustache shot with gray and a Vandyke  
beard hid either the strength or the weakness  
of mouth and chin. He looked at Harry 
with almond-shaped, pensive dark eyes, so like 
the eyes that had shone on Harry's waking and 
sleeping dreams for months that the young fellow 
felt his heart rise again. Armorer ended by asking  
Harry (in his most winning manner) to help 
him pull the ordinance out of the fire. "It would 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0246" n="221"/> 
 
be," he said, impressively, "a favor he should not 
forget!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"And you must know, Mr. Armorer," said 
Harry, in a dismal tone at which the president 
chuckled within, "that there is no man whose 
favor I would do so much to win!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, here's your chance!" said Armorer. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Harry swung round in his chair, his clinched 
fists on his knee. He was frowning with eagerness, 
 and his eyes were like blue steel. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"See here, Mr. Armorer," said he, "I am frank 
with you. I want to please you, because I want 
to ask you to let me marry your daughter. But I 
<hi rend="italic">can't</hi> please you, because I am mayor of this 
town, and I don't dare to let you dismiss the 
conductors. I don't <hi rend="italic">dare</hi>, that's the point. We 
have had four children killed on this road since 
electricity was put in." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"We have had forty killed on one street 
railway I know; what of it? Do you want to 
give up electricity because it kills children?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"No, but look here! the conductors lessen the 
risk. A lady I know, only yesterday, had a little 
boy going from the kindergarten home, nice little 
fellow only five years old &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"She ought to have sent a nurse with a 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0247" n="222"/> 
 
child five years old, a baby!" cried Armorer, 
warmly. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"That lady," answered Harry, quietly, "goes 
without any servant at all in order to keep her 
two children at the kindergarten; and the boy's 
elder sister was ill at home. The boy got on the 
car, and when he got off at the crossing above his 
house, he started to run across; the other train-car  
was coming, the little fellow didn't notice, and 
ran to cross; he stumbled and fell right in the 
path of the coming car!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Where was the conductor? He didn't seem 
much good!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"They had left off the conductor on that line." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, did they run over the boy? Why 
haven't I been informed of the accident?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"There was no accident. A man on the front 
platform saw the boy fall, made a flying leap off 
the moving car, fell, but scrambled up and pulled 
the boy off the track. It was sickening; I 
thought we were both gone!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, you were the man?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I was the man; and don't you see, Mr. 
Armorer, why I feel strongly on the subject? If 
the conductor had been on, there wouldn't have 
been any occasion for any accident." 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0248" n="223"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, sir, you may be assured that we will 
take precautions against any such accidents. It 
is more for our interest than anyone's to guard 
against them. And I have explained to you the 
necessity of cutting down our expense list." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"That is just it, you think you have to risk our 
lives to cut down expenses; but we get all the 
risk and none of the benefits. I can't see my way 
clear to helping you, sir; I wish I could." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Then there is nothing more to say, Mr. Lossing,"  
said Armorer, coldly. "I'm sorry a mere 
sentiment that has no real foundation should 
stand in the way of our arranging a deal that 
would be for the advantage of both the city and 
our road." He rose. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Harry rose also, but lifted his hand to arrest 
the financier. "Pardon me, there is something 
else; I wouldn't mention it, but I hear you are 
going to leave to-morrow and go abroad with &mdash;  
Miss  
Armorer. I am conscious I haven't introduced  
myself very favorably, by refusing you a 
favor when I want to ask the greatest one possible; 
 but I hope, sir, you will not think the less 
of a man because he is not willing to sacrifice the 
interests of the people who trust him, to please 
<hi rend="italic">anyone</hi>. I &mdash; I hope you will not object to my asking 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0249" n="224"/> 
 
Miss Armorer to marry me," concluded Harry, 
very hot and shaky, and forgetting the beginning 
of his sentences before he came to the end. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Does my daughter love you, do I understand, 
Mr. Lossing?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I don't know, sir. I wish I did." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, Mr. Lossing," said Armorer, wishing 
that something in the young man's confusion 
would not remind him of the awful moment when 
he asked old Forrester for his Jenny, "I am afraid 
I can do nothing for you. If you have too nice 
a conscience to oblige me, I am afraid it will 
be too nice to let you get on in the world. 
Good-morning." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Stop a minute," said Harry; "if it is only 
my ability to get on in the world that is the 
trouble, I think &mdash;" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"It is your love for my daughter," said 
Armorer; "if you don't love her enough to 
give up a sentimental notion for her, to win her, 
I don't see but you must lose her, I bid you 
good-morning, sir." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Not quite yet, sir" &mdash; Harry jumped before the 
door; "you give me the alternative of being what 
I call dishonorable or losing the woman I love!" 
He pronounced the last word with a little effort 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0250" n="225"/> 
 
and his lips closed sharply as his teeth shut under 
them. "Well, I decline the alternative. I shall 
try to do my duty and get the wife I want, <hi rend="italic">both</hi>." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, you give me fair warning, don't you?" 
said Armorer. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Harry held out his hand, saying, "I am sorry 
that I detained you. I didn't mean to be rude." 
There was something boyish and simple about 
the action and the tone, and Armorer laughed. 
As Harry attended him through the outer office 
to the door, he complimented the shops. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Miss Armorer and Mrs. Ellis have promised 
to give me the pleasure of showing them to them 
this afternoon," said Harry; "can't I show them 
and part of our city to you, also? It has changed 
a good deal since you left it." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The remark threw Armorer off his balance; for 
a rejected suitor this young man certainly kept an 
even mind. But he had all the helplessness of 
the average American with regard to his daughter's 
amusements. The humor in the situation took 
him; and it cannot be denied that he began to 
have a vivid curiosity about Harry. In less time 
than it takes to read it, his mind had swung round 
the circle of these various points of view, and he 
had blandly accepted Harry's invitation. But he 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0251" n="226"/> 
 
mopped a warm and furrowed brow, outside, 
and drew a prodigious sigh as he opened the 
note-book in his hand and crossed out, <hi rend="italic">"See L."</hi> 
"That young fellow ain't all conscience," said he, 
"not by a long shot." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He found Mrs. Ellis very apologetic about the 
Lossing engagement. It was made through the 
telephone; Esther had been anxious to have her 
father meet Lossing; Lossing was to drive them 
there, and later show Mr. Armorer the town. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Mr. Lossing is a very clever young man, very," 
said Armorer, gravely, as he went out to smoke 
his cigar after luncheon. He wished he had 
stayed, however, when he returned to find that 
a visitor had called, and that this visitor was the 
mother of the little boy that Harry Lossing had 
saved from the car. The two women gave him 
the accident in full, and were lavish of harrowing 
detail, including the mother's feelings. "So you 
see, 'Raish," urged Mrs. Ellis, timidly, "there is 
some reason for opposition to the ordinance." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Esther's cheeks were red and her eyes shone, 
but she had not spoken. Her father put his arm 
around her waist and kissed her hair. "And what 
did you say, Essie," he asked, gently, "to all the 
criticisms?" 
 
</p> 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0252"/> 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0253" n="228"/> 
 

 
<p> 
"I told her I thought you would find some 
way to protect the children even if the conductors 
were taken off; you didn't enjoy the slaughter of 
children any more than anyone else." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I guess we can fix it. Here is your young 
man." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Harry drove a pair of spirited horses. He 
drove well, and looked both handsome and happy. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Did you know that lady &mdash; the mother of the 
boy that wasn't run over &mdash; was coming to see my 
sister?" said Armorer, on the way. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I did," said Harry, "I sent her; I thought 
she could explain the reason why I shall have to 
oppose the bill, better than I." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Armorer made no reply. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
At the shops he kept his eye on the young man. 
Harry seemed to know most of his workmen, and 
had a nod or a word for all the older men. He 
stopped several moments to talk with one old 
German who complained of everything, but 
looked after Harry with a smile, nodding his 
head. "That man, Lieders, is our best workman; 
 you can't get any better work in the 
country," said he. "I want you to see an armoire 
that he has carved, it is up in our exhibition 
room." 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0254" n="229"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Armorer said, "You seem to get on very well 
with your working people, Mr. Lossing." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I think we generally get on well with them, 
and they do well themselves, in these Western 
towns. For one thing, we haven't much organization  
to fight, and for another thing, the individual 
workman has a better chance to rise. That man 
Lieders, whom you saw, is worth a good many 
thousand dollars; my father invested his savings 
for him." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"You are one of the philanthropists, aren't you, 
Mr. Lossing, who are trying to elevate the laboring  
classes?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Not a bit of it, sir. I shall never try to elevate  
the laboring classes; it is too big a contract. 
But I try as hard as I know how to have every 
man who has worked for Harry Lossing the better 
for it. I don't concern myself with any other 
laboring men." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Just then a murmur of exclamations came from 
Mrs. Ellis and Esther, whom the superintendent 
was piloting through the shops. "Oh, no, it is 
too heavy; oh, don't do it, Mr. Cardigan!" "Oh, 
we can see it perfectly well from here! <hi rend="italic">Please</hi> 
don't, you will break yourself somewhere!" Mrs. 
Ellis shrieked this; but the shrieks turned to a 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0255" n="230"/> 
 
murmur of admiration as a huge carved sideboard 
came bobbing and wobbling, like an intoxicated 
piece of furniture in a haunted house, toward the 
two gentlewomen. Immediately, a short but 
powerfully built man, whose red face beamed 
above his dusty shoulders like a full moon with a 
mustache, emerged, and waved his hand at the 
sideboard. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I could tackle the two of them, begging your 
pardon, ladies." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"That's Cardigan," explained Harry, "Miss 
Armorer may have told you about him. Oh, 
<hi rend="italic">Shuey!"</hi> 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Cardigan approached and was presented. He 
brought both his heels together and bowed solemnly, 
 bending his head at the same time. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Pleased to meet you, sir," said Shuey. Then 
he assumed an attitude of military attention. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Take us up in the elevator, will you, Shuey?" 
said Harry. "Step in, Mr. Armorer, please, we 
will go and see the reproductions of the antique; 
we have a room upstairs." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Mr. Armorer stepped in, Shuey following; and 
then, before Harry could enter it, the elevator 
shot upward and &mdash; stuck! 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"What's the matter?" cried Armorer. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0256" n="231"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Shuey was tugging at the wire rope. He called, 
in tones that seemed to come from a panting 
chest: "Take a pull at it yourself, sir! Can you 
move it?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Armorer grasped the rope viciously; Shuey was 
on the seat pulling from above. "We're stuck, 
sir, fast!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Can't you get down either?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Divil a bit, saving your presence, sir. Do ye 
think like the water-works could be busted?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Can't you make somebody hear?" panted 
Armorer. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, you see there's a deal of noise of the 
machinery," said Shuey, scratching his chin with 
a thoughtful air, "and they expect we've gone 
up!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Best try, anyhow. This infernal machine may 
take a notion to drop!" said Armorer. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"And that's true, too," acquiesced Shuey. 
Forthwith he did lift up his voice in a loud wailing: 
 <hi rend="italic">"Oh&mdash;h</hi>, Jimmy! <hi rend="italic">Oh&mdash;h</hi>, Jimmy Ryan!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Jimmy might have been in Chicago for any 
response he made; though Armorer shouted with 
Shuey; and at every pause the whir of the 
machinery mocked the shouters. Indescribable 
moans and gurgles, with a continuous malignant 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0257" n="232"/> 
 
hiss, floated up to them from the rebel steam 
below, as from a volcano considering eruption. 
"They'll be bound to need the elevator some 
time, if they don't need <hi rend="italic">us</hi>, and that's one comfort! 
" said Shuey, philosophically. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Don't you think if we pulled on her we could 
get her up to the next floor, by degrees? Now 
then!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Armorer gave a dash and Shuey let out his 
muscles in a giant tug. The elevator responded 
by an astonishing leap that carried them past 
three or four floors! 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Stop her! stop her!" bawled Shuey; but in 
spite of Armorer's pulling himself purple in the 
face, the elevator did not stop until it bumped 
with a crash against the joists of the roof. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, do you suppose we're stuck <hi rend="italic">here?"</hi> 
growled Armorer. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Well, sir, I'll try. Say, don't be exerting 
yourself violent. It strikes me she's for all the 
world like the wimmen,&mdash; in exthremes, sir, in exthremes! 
 And it wouldn't be noways so pleasant 
to go riproaring that gait down cellar! Slow and 
easy, sir, let me manage her. Hi! she's working." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
In fact, by slow degrees and much puffing, 
 
</p> 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0258"/> 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0259" n="234"/> 
 
<p> 
 
Shuey got the erratic box to the next floor, where, 
disregarding Shuey's protestations that he could 
"make her mind," Mr. Armorer got out, and 
they left the elevator to its fate. It was a long 
way, through many rooms, downstairs. Shuey 
would have beguiled the way by describing the 
rooms, but Armorer was in a raging hurry and 
urged his guide over the ground. Once they 
were delayed by a bundle of stuff in front of a 
door; and after Shuey had laboriously rolled the 
great roll away, he made a misstep and tumbled 
over, rolling it back, to a tittering accompaniment 
from the sewing-girls in the room. But he picked 
himself up in perfect good temper and kicked the 
roll ten yards. "Girls is silly things," said the 
philosopher Shuey, "but being born that way it 
ain't to be expected otherwise!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He had the friendly freedom of his class in the 
West. He praised Mrs. Ellis's gymnastics, and 
urged Armorer to stay over a morning train and 
see a "real pretty boxing match" between Mr. 
Lossing and himself. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, he boxes too, does he?" said Armorer. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"And why on earth would he groan-like?" 
wondered Shuey to himself. "He does that, sir," 
he continued aloud; "didn't Mrs. Ellis ever tell 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0260" n="235"/> 
 
you about the time at the circus? She was there 
herself, with three children she borrowed and an 
unreasonable gyurl, with a terrible big screech in 
her and no sense. Yes, sir, Mr. Lossing he is 
mighty cliver with his hands! There come a yell 
of 'Lion loose! lion loose!' at that circus, just 
as the folks was all crowding out at the end of it, 
and them that had gone into the menagerie tent 
came a-tumbling and howling back, and them that 
was in the circus tent waiting for the concert 
(which never ain't worth waiting for, between you 
and me!) was a-scrambling off them seats, making 
a noise like thunder; and all fighting and pushing 
and bellowing to get out! I was there with my 
wife and making for the seats that the fools quit, 
so's to get under and crawl out under the canvas, 
when I see Mrs. Ellis holding two of the children, 
and that fool girl let the other go and I grabbed 
it. 'Oh, save the baby! save one, anyhow,' cries 
my wife &mdash; the woman is a tinder-hearted crechure! 
And just then I seen an old lady tumble over on 
the benches, with her gray hair stringing out of 
her black bonnet. The crowd was <hi rend="italic">wild</hi>, hitting 
and screaming and not caring for anything, and I 
see a big jack of a man come plunging down right 
spang on that old lady! His foot was right in 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0261" n="236"/> 
 
the air over her face! Lord, it turned me sick. 
I yelled. But that minnit I seen an arm shoot 
out and that fellow shot off as slick! it was Mr. 
Lossing. He parted that crowd, hitting right and 
left, and he got up to us and hauled a child from 
Mrs. Ellis and put it on the seats, all the while 
shouting: 'Keep your seats! it's all right! it's 
all over! stand back!' I turned and floored a 
feller that was too pressing, and hollered it was 
all right too. And some more people hollered 
too. You see, there is just a minnit at such 
times when it is a toss up whether folks will quiet 
down and begin to laugh, or get scared into wild 
beasts and crush and kill each other. And Mr. 
Lossing he caught the minnit! The circus folks 
came up and the police, and it was all over. <hi rend="italic">Well</hi>, 
just look here, sir; there's our folks coming out 
of the elevator!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
They were just landing; and Mrs. Ellis wanted 
to know where he had gone. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"We run away from ye, shure," said Shuey, 
grinning; and he related the adventure. Armorer  
fell back with Mrs. Ellis. "Did you stay 
with Esther every minute?" said he. Mrs. Ellis 
nodded. She opened her lips to speak, then 
closed them and walked ahead to Harry Lossing. 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0262" n="237"/> 
 
Armorer looked &mdash; suspicion of a dozen kinds 
gnawing him and insinuating that the three all 
seemed agitated &mdash; from Harry to Esther, and then 
to Shuey. But he kept his thoughts to himself 
and was very agreeable the remainder of the afternoon. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He heard Harry tell Mrs. Ellis that the city 
council would meet that evening; before, however, 
 Armorer could feel exultant he added, "but 
may I come late?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"He is certainly the coolest beggar," Armorer 
snarled, "but he is sharp as a nigger's razor, confound  
him!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Naturally this remark was a confidential one to 
himself. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
He thought it more times than one during the 
evening, and by consequence played trumps with 
equal disregard of the laws of the noble game of 
whist and his partner's feelings. He found a few, 
a very few, elderly people who remembered his 
parent, and they will never believe ill of Horatio 
Armorer, who talked so simply and with so much 
feeling of old times, and who is going to give 
a memorial window in the new Presbyterian 
church. He was beginning to think with some 
interest of supper, the usual dinner of the family 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0263" n="238"/> 
 
having been sacrificed to the demands of state; 
then he saw Harry Lossing. The young mayor's 
blond head was bowing before his sister's black 
velvet. He caught Armorer's eye and followed 
him out to the lawn and the shadows and the gay 
lanterns. He looked animated. Evening dress 
was becoming to him. "One of my daughters 
married a prince, but I am hanged if he looked it 
like this fellow," thought Armorer; "but then he 
was only an Italian. I suppose the council did 
not pass the ordinance? your committee reported 
against it?" he said quite amicably to Harry. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I wish you could understand how much pain 
it has given me to oppose you, Mr. Armorer," 
said Harry, blushing. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I don't doubt it, under the circumstances, Mr. 
Lossing." Armorer spoke with suave politeness, 
but there was a cynical gleam in his eye. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"But Esther understands," says Harry. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Esther!" repeats Armorer, with an indescribable  
intonation. "You spoke to her this afternoon? 
 For a man with such high-toned ideas as 
you carry, I think you took a pretty mean advantage  
of your guests!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"You will remember I gave you fair warning, 
Mr. Armorer." 
 
</p> 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0264"/>  
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0265"/> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0266" n="241"/> 
 
<p> 
"It was while I was in the elevator, of course. 
I guessed it was a put-up job; how did you 
manage it?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Harry smiled outright; he is one who cannot 
keep either his dog or his joke tied up. "It was 
Shuey did it," said he; "he pulled the opposite 
way from you, and he has tremendous strength; 
but he says you were a handful for him." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"You seem to have taken the town into your 
confidence," said Armorer, bitterly, though he 
had a sneaking inclination to laugh himself; "do 
you need all your workmen to help you court 
your girl?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I'd take the whole United States into my 
confidence rather than lose her, sir," answered 
Harry, steadily. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Armorer turned on his heel abruptly; it was to 
conceal a smile. "How about my sister? did 
you propose before her? But I don't suppose a 
little thing like that would stop you." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I had to speak; Miss Armorer goes away tomorrow. 
 Mrs. Ellis was kind enough to put her 
fingers in her ears and turn her back." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"And what did my daughter say?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I asked her only to give me the chance to 
show her how I loved her, and she has. God bless 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0267" n="242"/> 
 
her! I don't pretend I'm worthy of her, Mr. 
Armorer, but I have lived a decent life, and I'll 
try hard to live a better one for her trust in me." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"I'm glad there is one thing on which we are 
agreed," jeered Armorer, "but you are more 
modest than you were this noon. I think it was 
considerably like bragging, sending that woman 
to tell of your heroic feats!" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Oh, I can brag when it is necessary," said 
Harry, serenely; "what would the West be but 
for bragging?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"And what do you intend to do if I take your 
girl to Europe?"  
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Europe is not very far," said Harry. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Armorer was a quick thinker, but he had never 
thought more quickly in his life. This young 
fellow had beaten him. There was no doubt 
of it. He might have principles, but he declined  
to let his principles hamper him. There 
was something about Harry's waving aside defeat 
so lightly, and so swiftly snatching at every chance 
to forward his will, that accorded with Armorer's 
own temperament. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"Tell me, Mr. Armorer," said Harry, suddenly; 
"in my place wouldn't you have done the same 
thing?" 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002489_0268" n="243"/> 
 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Armorer no longer checked his sense of humor. 
"No, Mr. Lossing," he answered, sedately, "I 
should have respected the old gentleman's wishes 
and voted any way he pleased." He held out his 
hand. "I guess Esther thinks you are the coming  
young man of the century; and to be honest, 
I like you a great deal better than I expected to 
this morning. I'm not cut out for a cruel father, 
Mr. Lossing; for one thing, I haven't the time 
for it; for another thing, I can't bear to have my 
little girl cry. I guess I shall have to go to 
Europe without Esther. Shall we go in to the 
ladies now?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Harry wrung the president's hand, crying that 
he should never regret his kindness. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
"See that Esther never regrets it, that will be 
better," said Armorer, with a touch of real and 
deep feeling. Then, as Harry sprang up the 
steps like a boy, he took out the note-book, and 
smiling a smile in which many emotions were 
blended, he ran a black line through
