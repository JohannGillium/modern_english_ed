    <head>her first Appearance</head>

    <p>It was at the end of the first act of the first night of "The Sultana," and every member of
     the Lester Comic Opera Company, from Lester himself down to the wardrobe woman's son, who would
     have had to work if his mother lost her place, was sick with anxiety. </p>
    <p>There is perhaps only one other place as feverish as it is behind the scenes on the first
     night of a comic opera, and that is a newspaper office on the last night of a Presidential
     campaign, when the returns are being flashed on the canvas outside, and the mob is howling, and
     the editor-in-chief is expecting to go to the Court of St. James if the election <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0021" n="4"/>
      comes his way, and the office-boy is betting his wages that it won't. </p>
    <p>Such nights as these try men's souls; but Van Bibber passed the stage-door man with as calmly
     polite a nod as though the piece had been running a hundred nights, and the manager was
     thinking up souvenirs for the one hundred and fiftieth, and the prima donna had, as usual,
     begun to hint for a new set of costumes. The stage-door keeper hesitated and was lost, and Van
     Bibber stepped into the unsuppressed excitement of the place with a pleased sniff at the
     familiar smell of paint and burning gas, and the dusty odor that came from the scene-lofts
     above. </p>
    <p>For a moment he hesitated in the cross-lights and confusion about him, failing to recognize
     in their new costumes his old acquaintances of the company; but he saw Kripps, the
     stage-manager, in the centre of <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0022" n="5"/>
     the stage, perspiring and in his shirtsleeves as always, wildly waving an arm to some
     one in the flies, and beckoning with the other to the gasman in the front entrance. The stage
     hands were striking the scene for the first act, and fighting with the set for the second, and
     dragging out a canvas floor of tessellated marble, and running a throne and a practical pair of
     steps over it, and aiming the high quaking walls of a palace and abuse at whoever came in their
     way.</p>
    <p>"Now then, Van Bibber," shouted Kripps, with a wild glance of recognition, as the
     white-and-black figure came towards him, "you know you're the only man in New York who gets
     behind here to-night. But you can't stay. Lower it, lower it, can't you?" This to the man in
     the flies. "Any other night goes, but not this night. I can't have it. I&mdash; Where is
     the backing for the <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0023" n="6"/> centre entrance? Didn't I tell you men&mdash;" </p>
    <p>Van Bibber dodged two stage hands who were steering a scene at him, stepped over the carpet
     as it unrolled, and brushed through a group of anxious, whispering chorus people into the quiet
     of the star's dressing-room. </p>
    <p>The star saw him in the long mirror before which he sat, while his dresser tugged at his
     boots, and threw up his hands, desperately. </p>
    <p>"Well," he cried, in mock resignation, "are we in it or are we not? Are they in their seats
     still or have they fled?" </p>
    <p>"How are you, John?" said Van Bibber to the dresser. Then he dropped into a big arm-chair in
     the corner, and got up again with a protesting sigh to light his cigar between the wires around
     the gas-burner. "Oh, it's going very well. I wouldn't have come around if it <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0024" n="7"/>
     wasn't. If the rest of it is as good as the first act, you needn't worry." </p>
    <p>Van Bibber's unchallenged freedom behind the scenes had been a source of much comment and
     perplexity to the members of the Lester Comic Opera Company. He had made his first appearance
     there during one hot night of the long run of the previous summer, and had continued to be an
     almost nightly visitor for several weeks. At first it was supposed that he was backing the
     piece, that he was the "Angel," as those weak and wealthy individuals are called who allow
     themselves to be led into supplying the finances for theatrical experiments. But as he never
     peered through the curtain-hole to count the house, nor made frequent trips to the front of it
     to look at the box sheet, but was, on the contrary, just as undisturbed on a rainy night as on

     the front entrance, this supposition was discarded as untenable. Nor did he show the
     least interest in the prima donna, or in any of the other pretty women of the company; he did
     not know them, nor did he make any effort to know them, and it was not until they inquired
     concerning him outside of the theatre that they learned what a figure in the social life of the
     city he really was. He spent most of his time in Lester's dressing-room smoking, listening to
     the reminiscences of Lester's dresser when Lester was on the stage; and this seclusion and his
     clerical attire of evening dress led the second comedian to call him Lester's father confessor,
     and to suggest that he came to the theatre only to take the star to task for his sins. And in
     this the second comedian was unknowingly not so very far wrong. Lester, the comedian, and young
     Van Bibher had known each other at the <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0026" n="9"/> university, when Lester's voice and gift of
     mimicry had made him the leader in the college theatricals; and later, when he had gone upon
     the stage, and had been cut off by his family even after he had become famous, or on account of
     it, Van Bibber had gone to visit him, and had found him as simple and sincere and boyish as he
     had been in the days of his Hasty-Pudding successes. And Lester, for his part, had found Van
     Bibber as likable as did every one else, and welcomed his quiet voice and youthful knowledge of
     the world as a grateful relief to the boisterous <hi rend="italic">camaraderie</hi> of his
     professional acquaintances. And he allowed Van Bibber to scold him, and to remind him of what
     he owed to himself, and to touch, even whether it hurt or not, upon his better side. And in
     time he admitted to finding his friend's occasional comments on stage matters of value as
     coming <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0027" n="10"/> from the point of view of those who look on at the game; and even Kripps,
     the veteran, regarded him with respect after he had told him that he could turn a set of purple
     costumes black by throwing a red light on them. To the company, after he came to know them, he
     was gravely polite, and, to those who knew him if they had overheard, amusingly commonplace in
     his conversation. He understood them better than they did themselves, and made no mistakes. The
     women smiled on him, but the men were suspicious and shy of him until they saw that he was
     quite as shy of the women; and then they made him a confidant, and told him all their woes and
     troubles, and exhibited all their little jealousies and ambitions, in the innocent hope that he
     would repeat what they said to Lester. They were simple, unconventional, light-hearted folk,
     and Van Bibber <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0028" n="11"/>
     found them vastly more entertaining and preferable to the silence of the deserted
     club, where the matting was down, and from whence the regular <hi rend="italic">habitues</hi>
     had departed to the other side or to Newport. He liked the swing of the light, bright music as
     it came to him through the open door of the dressing-room, and the glimpse he got of the chorus
     people crowding and pushing for a quick charge up the iron stairway, and the feverish smell of
     oxygen in the air, and the picturesque disorder of Lester's wardrobe, and the wigs and swords,
     and the mysterious articles of make-up, all mixed together on a tray with half-finished cigars
     and autograph books and newspaper notices." </p>
    <p>And he often wished he was clever enough to be an artist with the talent to paint the
     unconsciously graceful groups in the sharply divided light and shadow of the wings as he saw
      <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0029" n="12"/>
     them. The brilliantly colored, fantastically clothed girls leaning against the bare
     brick wall of the theatre, or whispering together in circles, with their arms close about one
     another, or reading apart and solitary, or working at some piece of fancy-work as soberly as
     though they were in a rocking-chair in their own flat, and not leaning against a scene brace,
     with the glare of the stage and the applause of the house just behind them. He liked to watch
     them coquetting with the big fireman detailed from the precinct engine-house, and clinging
     desperately to the curtain wire, or with one of the chorus men on the stairs, or teasing the
     phlegmatic scene-shifters as they tried to catch a minute's sleep on a pile of canvas. He even
     forgave the prima donna's smiling at him from the stage, as he stood watching her from the
     wings, and smiled back at her with polite cynicism, as though <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0030" n="13"/> he did not know and
     she did not know that her smiles were not for him, but to disturb some more interested one in
     the front row. And so, in time, the company became so well accustomed to him that he moved in
     and about as unnoticed as the stage-manager himself, who prowled around hissing "hush" on
     principle, even though he was the only person who could fairly be said to be making a noise. </p>
    <p>The second act was on, and Lester came off the stage and ran to the dressing-room and
     beckoned violently. "Come here," he said; "you ought to see this; the children are doing their
     turn. You want to hear them. They're great!" </p>
    <p>Van Bibber put his cigar into a tumbler and stepped out into the wings. They were crowded on
     both sides of the stage with the members of the company; the girls were tiptoeing, with their
     hands on the <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0031" n="14"/> shoulders of the men, and making futile little leaps into the air to
     get a better view, and others were resting on one knee that those behind might see over their
     shoulders. There were over a dozen children before the footlights, with the prima donna in the
     centre. She was singing the verses of a song, and they were following her movements, and
     joining in the chorus with high piping voices. They seemed entirely too much at home and too
     self-conscious to please Van Bibber; but there was one exception. The one exception was the
     smallest of them, a very, very little girl, with long auburn hair and black eyes; such a very
     little girl that every one in the house looked at her first, and then looked at no one else.
     She was apparently as unconcerned to all about her, excepting the pretty prima donna, as though
     she were by a piano at home practising a singing lesson. She seemed to think it was <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0032" n="15"
     /> some new sort of a game. When the prima donna raised her arms, the child raised hers; when
     the prima donna courtesied, she stumbled into one, and straightened herself just in time to get
     the curls out of her eyes, and to see that the prima donna was laughing at her, and to smile
     cheerfully back as if to say, <hi rend="italic">"We</hi> are doing our best anyway, aren't we?"
     She had big, gentle eyes and two wonderful dimples, and in the excitement of the dancing and
     the singing her eyes laughed and flashed, and the dimples deepened and disappeared and
     reappeared again. She was as happy and innocent looking as though it were nine in the morning
     and she were playing school at a kindergarten. From all over the house the women were murmuring
     their delight, and the men were laughing and pulling their mustaches and nudging each other to
     "look at the littlest one." 
     <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0033" n="16"/>
    </p>
    <p>The girls in the wings were rapturous in their enthusiasm, and were calling her absurdly
     extravagant titles of endearment, and making so much noise that Kripps stopped grinning at her
     from the entrance, and looked back over his shoulder as he looked when he threatened fines and
     calls for early rehearsal. And when she had finished finally, and the prima donna and the
     children ran off together, there was a roar from the house that went to Lester's head like
     wine, and seemed to leap clear across the footlights and drag the children back again. </p>
    <p>"That settles it!" cried Lester, in a suppressed roar of triumph. "I knew that child would
     catch them." </p>
    <p>There were four encores, and then the children and Elise Broughten, the pretty prima donna,
     came off jubilant and happy, with the Littlest Girl's arms full of flowers, which the <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0034"
      n="17"/> management had with kindly forethought prepared for the prima donna, but which that
     delightful young person and the delighted leader of the orchestra had passed over to the little
     girl. </p>
    <p>"Well," gasped Miss Broughten, as she came up to Van Bibber laughing, and with one hand on
     her side and breathing very quickly, "will you kindly tell me who is the leading woman now? Am
     I the prima donna, or am I not? I wasn't in it, was I?" </p>
    <p>"You were not," said Van Bibber. </p>
    <p>He turned from the pretty prima donna and hunted up the wardrobe woman, and told her he
     wanted to meet the Littlest Girl. And the wardrobe woman, who was fluttering wildly about, and
     as delighted as though they were all her own children, told him to come into the property-room,
     where the children were, and which had been changed <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0035" n="18"/>
     into a dressing-room that they might be by themselves. The six little girls were in
     six different states of dishabille, but they were too little to mind that, and Van Bibber was
     too polite to observe it. </p>
    <p>"This is the little girl, sir," said the wardrobe woman, excitedly, proud at being the means
     of bringing together two such prominent people. "Her name is Madeline. Speak to the gentleman,
     Madeline; he wants to tell you what a great big hit youse made." </p>
    <p>The little girl was seated on one of the cushions of a double throne so high from the ground
     that the young woman who was pulling off the child's silk stockings and putting woollen ones on
     in their place did so without stooping. The young woman looked at Van Bibber and nodded
     somewhat doubtfully and ungraciously, and Van Bibber turned to the little girl in preference.
     The young woman's </p>
     
     <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0036"/>
     <p>"HE KNEW THAT WAS NOT THE REASON"</p>
     <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0037"/> 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0038" n="19"/>
    <p>face was one of a type that was too familiar to be pleasant. </p>
    <p>He took the Littlest Girl's small hand in his and shook it solemnly, and said, "I am very
     glad to know you. Can I sit up here beside you, or do you rule alone?" </p>
    <p>"Yes, ma'am&mdash;yes, sir," answered the little girl. </p>
    <p>Van Bibber put his hands on the arms of the throne and vaulted up beside the girl, and pulled
     out the flower in his button-hole and gave it to her. </p>
    <p>"Now," prompted the wardrobe woman, "what do you say to the gentleman?" </p>
    <p>"Thank you, sir," stammered the little girl. </p>
    <p>"She is not much used to gentlemen's society," explained the woman who was pulling on the
     stockings. </p>
    <p>"I see," said Van Bibber. He did not know exactly what to say next. And yet he wanted to talk
      <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0039" n="20"/> to the child very much, so much more than he generally wanted to talk to most
     young women, who showed no hesitation in talking to him. With them he had no difficulty
     whatsoever. There was a doll lying on the top of a chest near them, and he picked this up and
     surveyed it critically. "Is this your doll he asked. </p>
    <p>"No," said Madeline, pointing to one of the children, who was much taller than herself; "it
     's 'at 'ittle durl's. My doll he's dead." </p>
    <p>"Dear me!" said Van Bibber. He made a mental note to get a live one in the morning, and then
     he said: "That's very sad. But dead dolls do come to life." </p>
    <p>The little girl looked up at him, and surveyed him intently and critically, and then smiled,
     with the dimples showing, as much as to say that she understood him and approved of him
     entirely. Van Bibber <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0040" n="21"/>
     answered this sign language by taking Madeline's hand in his and asking her how she
     liked being a great actress, and how soon she would begin to storm because <hi rend="italic"
      >that</hi> photographer hadn't sent the proofs. The young woman understood this, and deigned
     to smile at it, but Madeline yawned a very polite and sleepy yawn, and closed her eyes. Van
     Bibber moved up closer, and she leaned over until her bare shoulder touched his arm, and while
     the woman buttoned on her absurdly small shoes, she let her curly head fall on his elbow and
     rest there. Any number of people had shown confidence in Van Bibber&mdash;not in that form
     exactly, but in the same spirit&mdash;and though he was used to being trusted, he felt a
     sharp thrill of pleasure at the touch of the child's head on his arm, and in the warm clasp of
     her fingers around his. And he was conscious of a keen sense of <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0041" n="22"/> pity and sorrow
     for her rising in him, which he crushed by thinking that it was entirely wasted, and that the
     child was probably perfectly and ignorantly happy. </p>
    <p>"Look at that, now," said the wardrobe woman, catching sight of the child's closed eyelids;
     "just look at the rest of the little dears, all that excited they can't stand still to get
     their hats on, and she just as unconcerned as you please, and after making the hit of the
     piece, too." </p>
    <p>"She's not used to it, you see," said the young woman, knowingly; "she don't know what it
     means. It's just that much play to her." </p>
    <p>This last was said with a questioning glance at Van Bibber, in whom she still feared to find
     the disguised agent of a Children's Aid Society. Van Bibber only nodded in reply, and did not
     answer her, because he found he could not very well, for he was looking a long way ahead at <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0042"
      n="23"/> what the future was to bring to the confiding little being at his side, and thinking
     of the evil knowledge and temptations that would mar the beauty of her quaintly sweet face, and
     its strange mark of gentleness and refinement. Outside he could hear his friend Lester shouting
     the refrain of his new topical song, and the laughter and the hand-clapping came in through the
     wings and open door, broken but tumultuous. </p>
    <p>"Does she come of professional people?" Van Bibber asked, dropping into the vernacular. He
     spoke softly, not so much that he might not disturb the child, but that she might not
     understand what he said. </p>
    <p>"Yes," the woman answered, shortly, and bent her head to smooth out the child's stage dress
     across her knees. </p>
    <p>Van Bibber touched the little girl's head with his hand and found that she was asleep, and so
     let his hand <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0043" n="24"/>
     rest there, with the curls between his fingers. "Are&mdash;are you her mother?"
     he asked, with a slight inclination of his head. He felt quite confident she was not; at least,
     he hoped not. </p>
    <p>The woman shook her head. "No," she said. </p>
    <p>"Who is her mother ? </p>
    <p>The woman looked at the sleeping child and then up at him almost defiantly. "Ida Clare was
     her mother," she said. </p>
    <p>Van Bibber's protecting hand left the child as suddenly as though something had burned it,
     and he drew back so quickly that her head slipped from his arm, and she awoke and raised her
     eyes and looked up at him questioningly. He looked back at her with a glance of the strangest
     concern and of the deepest pity. Then he stooped and drew her towards him very tenderly, put
     her head back in the corner of his arm, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0044" n="25"/> watched her in silence while she
     smiled drowsily and went to sleep again. </p>
    <p>"And who takes care of her now?" he asked. </p>
    <p>The woman straightened herself and seemed relieved. She saw that the stranger had recognized
     the child's pedigree and knew her story, and that he was not going to comment on it. "I do,"
     she said. "After the divorce Ida came to me," she said, speaking more freely. "I used to be in
     her company when she was doing `Aladdin,' and then when I left the stage and started to keep an
     actors' boarding-house, she came to me. She lived on with us a year, until she died, and she
     made me the guardian of the child. I train children for the stage, you know, me and my sister,
     Ada Dyer; you've heard of her, I guess. The courts pay us for her keep, but it isn't much, and
     I'm expecting to get <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0045" n="26"/> what I spent on her from what she makes on the stage. Two of
     them other children are my pupils; but they can't touch Madie. She is a better dancer an'
     singer than any of them. If it hadn't been for the Society keeping her back, she would have
     been on the stage two years ago. She's great, she is. She'll be just as good as her mother was. </p>
    <p>Van Bibber gave a little start, and winced visibly, but turned it off into a cough. "And her
     father," he said hesitatingly, "does he&mdash;" </p>
    <p>" Her father," said the woman, tossing back her head, "he looks after himself, he does. We
     don't ask no favors of <hi rend="italic">him.</hi> She'll get along without him or his folks,
     thank you. Call him a gentleman? Nice gentleman he is!" Then she stopped abruptly. "I guess,
     though, you know him," she added. Perhaps he's a friend of yourn?" </p><pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0046" n="27"/>
    
    <p>"I just know him," said Van Bibber, wearily. </p>
    <p>He sat with the child asleep beside him while the woman turned to the others and dressed them
     for the third act. She explained that Madie would not appear in the last act, only the two
     larger girls, so she let her sleep, with the cape of Van Bibber's cloak around her. </p>
    <p>Van Bibber sat there for several long minutes thinking, and then looked up quickly, and
     dropped his eyes again as quickly, and said, with an effort to speak quietly and unconcernedly:
     "If the little girl is not on in this act, would you mind if I took her home? I have a cab at
     the stage door, and she's so sleepy it seems a pity to keep her up. The sister you spoke of or
     some one could put her to bed." </p>
    <p>"Yes," the woman said, doubtfully, "Ada's home. Yes, you can take her around, if you want
     to." </p><pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0047" n="28"/>
     
    <p>She gave him the address, and he sprang down to the floor, and gathered the child up in his
     arms and stepped out on the stage. The prima donna had the centre of it to herself at that
     moment, and all the rest of the company were waiting to go on; but when they saw the little
     girl in Van Bibber's arms they made a rush at her, and the girls leaned over and kissed her
     with a great show of rapture and with many gasps of delight. </p>
    <p>"Don't," said Van Bibber, he could not tell just why. "Don't." "</p>
    <p>"Why not?" asked one of the girls, looking up at him sharply. </p>
    <p>"She was asleep; you've wakened her," he said, gently. </p>
    <p>But he knew that was not the reason. He stepped into the cab at the stage entrance, and put
     the child carefully down in one corner. Then he looked back over his shoulder to see that there
     was no one near enough <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0048" n="29"/> to hear him, and said to the driver, "To the Berkeley
     Flats, on Fifth Avenue." He picked the child up gently in his arms as the carriage started, and
     sat looking out thoughtfully and anxiously as they flashed past the lighted shop-windows on
     Broadway. He was far from certain of this errand, and nervous with doubt, but he reassured
     himself that he was acting on impulse, and that his impulses were so often good. The hall-boy
     at the Berkeley said, yes, Mr. Caruthers was in, and Van Bibber gave a quick sigh of relief. He
     took this as an omen that his impulse was a good one. The young English servant who opened the
     hall door to Mr. Caruthers's apartment suppressed his surprise with an effort, and watched Van
     Bibber with alarm as he laid the child on the divan in the hall, and pulled a covert coat from
     the rack to throw over her. </p>
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0049" n="30"/>
        
    <p>"Just say Mr. Van Bibber would like to see him," he said, "and you need not speak of the
     little girl having come with me" </p>
    <p>She was still sleeping, and Van Bibber turned down the light in the hall, and stood looking
     down at her gravely while the servant went to speak to his master. </p>
    <p>"Will you come this way, please, sir?" he said. </p>
    <p>"You had better stay out here," said Van Bibber, "and come and tell me if she wakes." </p>
    <p>Mr. Caruthers was standing by the mantel over the empty fireplace, wrapped in a long, loose
     dressing-gown which he was tying around him as Van Bibber entered. He was partly undressed, and
     had been just on the point of getting into bed. Mr. Caruthers was a tall, handsome man, with
     dark reddish hair, turning below the temples into gray; his mustache was quite white, and his
      <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0050" n="31"/> eyes and face showed the signs of either dissipation or of great trouble, or of
     both. But even in the formless dressing-gown he had the look and the confident bearing of a
     gentleman, or, at least, of the man of the world. The room was very rich-looking, and was
     filled with the medley of a man's choice of good paintings and fine china, and papered with
     irregular rows of original drawings and signed etchings. The windows were open, and the lights
     were turned very low, so that Van Bibber could see the many gas lamps and the dark roofs of
     Broadway and the Avenue where they crossed a few blocks off, and the bunches of light on the
     Madison Square Garden, and to the lights on the boats of the East River. From below in the
     streets came the rattle of hurrying omnibuses and the rush of the hansom cabs. If Mr. Caruthers
     was surprised at this late visit, he hid it, and came <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0051" n="32"/> forward to receive his
     caller as if his presence were expected. </p>
    <p>"Excuse my costume, will you?" he said. "I turned in rather early to-night, it was so hot."
     He pointed to a decanter and some soda bottles on the table and a bowl of ice, and asked, "Will
     you have some of this?" And while he opened one of the bottles, he watched Van Bibber's face as
     though he were curious to have him explain the object of his visit. </p>
    <p>"No, I think not, thank you," said the younger man. He touched his forehead with his
     handkerchief nervously. "Yes, it is hot," he said. </p>
    <p>Mr. Caruthers filled a glass with ice and brandy and soda, and walked back to his place by
     the mantel, on which he rested his arm, while he clinked the ice in the glass and looked down
     into it. </p>
    <p>"I was at the first night of `The <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0052" n="33"/>
     Sultana' this evening," said Van Bibber, slowly and uncertainly. </p>
    <p>"Oh, yes," assented the elder man, politely, and tasting his drink. "Lester's new piece. Was
     it any good?" </p>
    <p>"I don't know," said Van Bibber. </p>
    <p>Yes, I think it was. I didn't see it from the front. There were a lot of children in
     it&mdash;little ones; they danced and sang, and made a great hit. One of them had never
     been on the stage before. It was her first appearance." </p>
    <p>He was turning one of the glasses around between his fingers as he spoke. He stopped, and
     poured out some of the soda, and drank it down in a gulp, and then continued turning the empty
     glass between the tips of his fingers. </p>
    <p>"It seems to me," he said, "that it is a great pity." He looked up interrogatively at the
     other, but Mr. Caruthers met his glance without <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0053" n="34"/> any returning show of interest. "I
     say," repeated Van Bibber&mdash; "I say it seems a pity that a child like that should be
     allowed to go on in that business. A grown woman can go into it with her eyes open, or a girl
     who has had decent training can too. But it's different with a child. She has no choice in the
     matter; they don't ask her permission; and she isn't old enough to know what it means; and she
     gets used to it and fond of it before she grows to know what the danger is. And then it's too
     late. It seemed to me that if there was any one who had a right to stop it, it would be a very
     good thing to let that person know about her&mdash;about this child, I mean; the one who
     made the hit&mdash;before it was too late. It seems to me a responsibility I wouldn't care
     to take myself. I wouldn't care to think that I had the chance to stop it, and had let the
     chance go by. You know <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0054" n="35"/> what the life is, and what the temptation a
     woman&mdash;" Van Bibber stopped with a gasp of concern, and added, hurriedly, "I mean we
     all know&mdash;every man knows." </p>
    <p>Mr. Caruthers was looking at him with his lips pressed closely together, and his eyebrows
     drawn into the shape of the letter V. He leaned forward, and looked at Van Bibber intently.</p>
    <p>"What is all this about?" he asked. "Did you come here, Mr. Van Bibber, simply to tell me
     this? What have you to do with it? What have I to do with it? Why did you come? </p>
    <p>"Because of the child." </p>
    <p>"What child?" </p>
    <p>"Your child," said Van Bibber. </p>
    <p>Young Van Bibber was quite prepared for an outbreak of some sort, and mentally braced himself
     to receive it. He rapidly assured himself that this man had every reason to be <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0055" n="36"/>
     angry, and that he, if he meant to accomplish anything, had every reason to be
     considerate and patient. So he faced Mr. Caruthers with shoulders squared, as though it were a
     physical shock he had had to stand against, and in consequence he was quite unprepared for what
     followed. For Mr. Caruthers raised his face without a trace of feeling in it, and, with his
     eyes still fixed on the glass in his hand, set it carefully down on the mantel beside him, and
     girded himself about with the rope of his robe. When he spoke, it was in a tone of quiet
     politeness. </p>
    <p>"Mr. Van Bibber," he began, you are a very brave young man. You have dared to say to me what
     those who are my best friends&mdash;what even my own family&mdash;would not care to
     say. They are afraid it might hurt me, I suppose. They have some absurd regard for my feelings;
     they hesitate to touch upon a subject <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0056" n="37"/> which in no way concerns them and which they
     know must be very painful to me. But you have the courage of your convictions; you have no
     compunctions about tearing open old wounds; and you come here, unasked and uninvited, to let me
     know what you think of my conduct, to let me understand that it does not agree with your own
     ideas of what I ought to do, and to tell me how I, who am old enough to be your father, should
     behave. You have rushed in where angels fear to tread, Mr. Van Bibber, to show me the error of
     my ways. I suppose I ought to thank you for it; but I have always said that it is not the
     wicked people who are to be feared in this world, or who do the most harm. We know them; we can
     prepare for them, and checkmate them. It is the well-meaning fool who makes all the trouble.
     For no one knows him until he discloses <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0057" n="38"/> himself, and the mischief is done before
     he can be stopped. I think, if you will allow me to say so, that you have demonstrated my
     theory pretty thoroughly, and have done about as much needless harm for one evening as you can
     possibly wish. And so, if you will excuse me," he continued, sternly, and moving from his
     place, "I will ask to say good-night, and will request of you that you grow older and wiser and
     much more considerate before you come to see me again." </p>
    <p>Van Bibber had flushed at Mr. Caruthers's first words, and had then grown somewhat pale, and
     straightened himself visibly. He did not move when the elder man had finished, but cleared his
     throat, and then spoke with some little difficulty. "It is very easy to call a man a fool," he
     said, slowly, "but it is much harder to be called a fool and not to throw the other man out <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0058"
      n="39"/>
     of the window. But that, you see, would not do any good, and I have something to say
     to you first. I am quite clear in my own mind as to my position, and I am not going to allow
     anything you have said or can say to annoy me much until I am through. There will be time
     enough to resent it then. I am quite well aware that I did an unconventional thing in coming
     here&mdash;a bold thing or a foolish thing, as you choose&mdash;but the situation is
     pretty bad, and I did as I would have wished to be done by if I had had a child going to the
     devil and didn't know it. I should have been glad to learn of it even from a stranger.
     However," he said, smiling grimly, and pulling his cape about him, "there are other kindly
     disposed people in the world besides fathers. There is an aunt, perhaps, or an uncle or two;
     and sometimes, even to-day, there is the chance Samaritan." </p>
    <p>Van Bibber picked up his high hat <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0059" n="40"/>
    from the table, looked into it critically, and settled it on his head. "Good-night,"
     he said, and walked slowly towards the door. He had his hand on the knob, when Mr. Caruthers
     raised his head. </p>
    <p>"Wait just one minute, please, Mr. Van Bibber?" asked Mr. Caruthers. </p>
    <p>Van Bibber stopped with a prompt obedience which would have led one to conclude that he might
     have put on his hat only to precipitate matters. </p>
    <p>"Before you go," said Mr. Caruthers, grudgingly, "I want to say&mdash;I want you to
     understand my position." </p>
    <p>"Oh, that's all right," said Van Bibber, lightly, opening the door. </p>
    <p>"No, it is not all right. One moment, please. I do not intend that you shall go away from
     here with the idea that you have tried to do a service, and that I have been unable to
     appreciate it, and that you </p>
     <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0060"/>
    <p>"YOU HAVE TRIED ME VERY SORELY"</p>
     <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0061"/> 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0062" n="41"/>
    <p>are a much-abused and much-misunderstood young man. Since you have done me the
     honor to make my affairs your business, I would prefer that you should understand them fully. I
     do not care to have you discuss my conduct at clubs and afternoon teas with young women until
     you&mdash;" </p>
    <p>Van Bibber drew in his breath sharply, with a peculiar whistling sound, and opened and shut
     his hands. "Oh, I wouldn't say that if I were you," he said, simply. </p>
    <p>"I beg your pardon," the older man said, quickly. "That was a mistake. I was wrong. I beg
     your pardon. But you have tried me very sorely. You have intruded upon a private trouble that
     you ought to know must be very painful to me. But I believe you meant well. I know you to be a
     gentleman, and I am willing think you acted on impulse, and that you will see to-morrow what a
     mistake you <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0063" n="42"/> have made. It is not a thing I talk about; I do not speak of it to my
     friends, and they are far too considerate to speak of it to me. But you have put me on the
     defensive. You have made me out more or less of a brute, and I don't intend to be so far
     misunderstood. There are two sides to every story, and there is something to be said about
     this, even for me." </p>
    <p>He walked back to his place beside the mantel, and put his shoulders against it, and faced
     Van Bibber, with his fingers twisted in the cord around his waist. </p>
    <p>"When I married," said Mr. Caruthers, "I did so against the wishes of my people and the
     advice of all my friends. You know all about that. God help us! who doesn't?" he added,
     bitterly. "It was very rich, rare reading for you and for everyone else who saw the daily
     papers, and we gave them all <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0064" n="43"/> they wanted of it. I took her out of that life and
     married her because I believed she was as good a woman as any of those who had never had to
     work for their living, and I was bound that my friends and your friends should recognize her
     and respect her as my wife had a right to be respected; and I took her abroad that I might give
     all you sensitive, fine people a chance to get used to the idea of being polite to a woman who
     had once been a burlesque actress. It began over there in Paris. What I went through then no
     one knows; but when I came back&mdash;and I would never have come back if she had not made
     me&mdash;it was my friends I had to consider, and not her. It was in the blood; it was in
     the life she had led, and in the life men like you and me had taught her to live. And it had to
     come out." </p>
    <p>The muscles of Mr. Caruthers's <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0065" n="44"/> face were moving, and beyond his control; but Van
     Bibber did not see this, for he was looking intently out of the window, over the roofs of the
     city. </p>
    <p>"She had every chance when she married me that a woman ever had," continued the older man.
     "It only depended on herself. I didn't try to make a housewife of her or a drudge. She had all
     the healthy excitement and all the money she wanted, and she had a home here ready for her when
     ever she was tired of travelling about and wished to settle down. And I was &mdash; and a
     husband that loved her as&mdash;she had everything&mdash;everything that a man's whole
     thought and love and money could bring to her. And you know what she did."</p>
    <p>He looked at Van Bibber, but Van Bibber's eyes were still turned towards the open window and
     the night. <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0066" n="45"/>
    </p>
    <p>And after the divorce&mdash;and she was free to go where she pleased, and to live as she
     pleased and with whom she pleased, without bringing disgrace on a husband who honestly loved
     her&mdash;I swore to my God that I would never see her nor her child again. And I never saw
     her again, not even when she died. I loved the mother, and she deceived me and disgraced me and
     broke my heart, and I only wish she had killed me; and I was beginning to love her child, and I
     vowed she should not live to trick me too. I had suffered as no man I know had suffered; in a
     way a boy like you cannot understand, and that no one can understand who has not gone to hell
     and been forced to live after it. And was I to go through that again? Was I to love and care
     for and worship this child, and have her grow up with all her mother's vanity and animal
     nature, and have her turn on <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0067" n="46"/> me some day and show me that what is bred in the bone
     must tell, and that I was a fool again&mdash;a pitiful fond fool? I could not trust her. I
     can never trust any woman or child again, and least of all that woman's child. She is as dead
     to me as though she were buried with her mother, and it is nothing to me what she is or what
     her life is. I know in time what it will be. She has begun earlier than I had supposed, that is
     all; but she is nothing to me." The man stopped and turned his back to Van Bibber, and hid his
     head in his hands, with his elbows on the mantelpiece. "I care too much," he said. "I cannot
     let it mean anything to me; when I do care, it means so much more to me than to other men. They
     may pretend to laugh and to forget and to, outgrow it, but it is not so with me. It means too
     much." He took a quick stride towards one of the <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0068" n="47"/>
     arm-chairs, and threw himself into it. </p>
    <p>Why, man," he cried, "I loved that child's mother to the day of her death. I loved that woman
     then, and, God help me! I love that woman still." </p>
    <p>He covered his face with his hands, and sat leaning forward and breathing heavily as he
     rocked himself to and fro. Van Bibber still stood looking gravely out at the lights that
     picketed the black surface of the city. He was to all appearances as unmoved by the outburst of
     feeling into which the older man had been surprised as though it had been something in a play.
     There was an unbroken silence for a moment, and then it was Van Bibber who was the first to
     speak. </p>
    <p>"I came here, as you say, on impulse," he said; "but I am glad I came, for I have your
     decisive answer now about the little girl. I have been thinking," he continued, <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0069" n="48"/>
     slowly, "since you have been speaking, and before, when I first saw her dancing in front of the
     footlights, when I did not know who she was, that I could give up a horse or two, if necessary,
     and support this child instead. Children are worth more than horses, and a man who saves a
     soul, as it says"&mdash;he flushed slightly, and looked up with a hesitating, deprecatory
     smile&mdash;"somewhere, wipes out a multitude of sins. And it may be I'd like to try and
     get rid of some of mine. I know just where to send her; I know the very place. It's down in
     Evergreen Bay, on Long Island. They are tenants of mine there, and very nice farm sort of
     people, who will be very good to her. They wouldn't know anything about her, and she'd forget
     what little she knows of this present life very soon, and grow up with the other children to be
     one of them; and then, when she gets older and <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0070" n="49"/> becomes a young lady, she could go
     to some school&mdash;but that's a bit too far ahead to plan for the present; but that's
     what I am going to do, though," said the young man, confidently, and as though speaking to
     himself. "That theatrical boarding-house person could be bought off easily enough," he went on,
     quickly, "and Lester won't mind letting her go if I ask it,&mdash;and&mdash;and that's
     what I'II do. As you say, it's a good deal of an experiment, but I think I'II run the risk." </p>
    <p>He walked quickly to the door and disappeared in the hall, and then came back, kicking the
     door open as he returned, and holding the child in his arms. </p>
    <p>"This is she," he said, quietly. He did not look at or notice the father, but stood, with the
     child asleep in the bend of his left arm, gazing down at her. "This is she," he repeated; "this
     is your child." <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0071" n="50"/>
    </p>
    <p>There was something cold and satisfied in Van Bibber's tone and manner, as though he were
     congratulating himself upon the engaging of a new groom; something that placed the father
     entirely outside of it. He might have been a disinterested looker-on. </p>
    <p>"She will need to be fed a bit," Van Bibber ran on, cheerfully. "They did not treat her very
     well, I fancy. She is thin and peaked and tired-looking." He drew up the loose sleeve of her
     jacket, and showed the bare forearm to the light. He put his thumb and little finger about it,
     and closed them on it gently. "It is very thin," he said. "And under her eyes, if it were not
     for the paint," he went on, mercilessly, "you could see how deep the lines are. This red spot
     on her cheek," he said, gravely, "is where Mary Vane kissed her to-night, and this is where
     Alma Stantley kissed <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0072" n="51"/> her, and that Lee girl. You have heard of them, perhaps. They
     will never kiss her again. She is going to grow up a sweet, fine, beautiful woman&mdash;are
     you not?" he said, gently drawing the child higher up on his shoulder, until her face touched
     his, and still keeping his eyes from the face of the older man. "She does not look like her
     mother," he said; "she has her father's auburn hair and straight nose and finer-cut lips and
     chin. She looks very much like her father. It seems a pity," he added, abruptly. </p>
    <p> She will grow up," he went on, without knowing him, or who he is&mdash;or was, if he
     should die. She will never speak with him, or see him, or take his hand. She may pass him some
     day on the street and will not know him, and he will not know her, but she will grow to be very
     fond and to be very grateful to the simple, kindhearted old people who will have <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0073" n="52"/>
     cared for her when she was a little girl." </p>
    <p>The child in his arms stirred, shivered slightly, and awoke. The two men watched her
     breathlessly, with silent intentness. She raised her head and stared around the unfamiliar room
     doubtfully, then turned to where her father stood, looking at him a moment, and passed him by;
     and then, looking up into Van Bibber's face, recognized him, and gave a gentle, sleepy smile,
     and, with a sigh of content and confidence, drew her arm up closer around his neck, and let her
     head fall back upon his breast. </p>
    <p>The father sprang to his feet with a quick, jealous gasp of pain. "Give her to me!" he said,
     fiercely, under his breath, snatching her out of Van Bibber's arms. "She is mine; give her to
     me!" </p>
    <p>Van Bibber closed the door gently behind him, and went jumping down <pb entity="DSSR_000002441_0074" n="53"/>
     the winding stairs of the Berkeley three steps at a time. </p>
    <p>And an hour later, when the English servant came to his master's door, he found him still
     awake and sitting in the dark by the open window, holding something in his arms and looking out
     over the sleeping city. </p>
    <p>"James, he said, "you can make up a place for me here on the lounge. Miss Caruthers, my
     daughter, will sleep in my room to-night. </p>
