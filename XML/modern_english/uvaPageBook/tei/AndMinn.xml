<head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
<p>
THE object of publishing these letters can be very briefly stated.
</p><p>
During the last autumn I made a tour into Minnesota, upwards
of a hundred and thirty miles north-west of St. Paul, to satisfy myself as
to the character and prospects of the territory. All I could learn from personal
observation, and otherwise, concerning its society and its ample means of
greatness, impressed me so favorably as to the advantages still open to the
settler, that I put down in the form of letters such facts as I thought would
be of general interest. Since their publication&mdash;in the <hi rend="italic">Boston, Post</hi>&mdash;a
few requests, which I could not comply with, were made for copies of them
all. I was led to believe, therefore, that if I revised them and added
information relative to unoccupied lands, the method of preemption, and the
business interests of the territory, they would be worthy of publication
in a more permanent form. Conscious that what I 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0019" n="viii"/>
have written is an inadequate
description of that splendid domain, I shall be happy indeed to have contributed,
in ever so small a degree, to advance its growth and welfare.
</p><p>
Here I desire to acknowledge the aid which has been readily
extended to my undertaking by the Delegate from Minnesota&mdash;Hon. HENRY M.
RICE&mdash;whose faithful and unwearied services&mdash;I will take the liberty to add&mdash;in
behalf of the territory, merit the highest praise. I am also indebted for
valuable information to EARL S. GOODRICH, Esq., editor of the <hi rend="italic">Daily Pioneer
</hi>(St. Paul) <hi rend="italic">and Democrat.</hi>
</p><p>
In another place I give a list of the works which
I have had occasion to consult or refer to.

<p>
I SIT down at the first place where a pen can be used,
to give you some account of my trip to Minnesota. And if any one should complain
that this is a dull letter, let me retain his good-will by the assurance
that the things I expect to describe in my next will be of more novelty and
interest. And here I am reminded of a good little anecdote which I am afraid
I shall not have a better chance to tell. An eminent minister of the Gospel
was preaching in a new place one Sunday, and about half through his sermon
when two or three dissatisfied hearers got up to leave, "My friends," said
he, "I have one small favor to ask. As an attempt has been made to prejudice
my reputation in this vicinity, I 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0029" n="18"/>
beg you to be candid enough, if any one
asks how you liked my sermon, to say you didn't stop to hear me through."
</p><p>
Stepping into the cars on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
a few evenings ago&mdash;for I am not going to say anything of my trip further
east&mdash;I saw as great an exhibition of selfishness as one often meets in
travelling. This was in the rear car, the others being all crowded. The seats
were spacious, and had high backs for night travelling. A gentleman entered
the car and proposed to sit in a seat in which was only one child, but he
was informed by a feminine voice in the rear that the whole seat was taken&mdash;so
he advanced to the next seat, which was occupied by another child, a boy
about eight years old&mdash;again the same voice, confirmed by one of the other
sex, informed him in very decided terms that that also was wholly occupied.
The gentleman of course did not attempt to take a seat with this lady, but
advancing still further, in a seat behind her he saw another child the only
occupant. His success here was no better. The fact was, here was a family
of a husband, wife, and three children occupying five entire seats. The traveller
politely asked if it would not be convenient for two of the children to sit
together. "No," said the lady and her husband (and they spoke together, though
they didn't sit together), "the children want all the room so as to sleep."
The traveller betrayed no feeling until the husband aforesaid pointed out
for him a seat 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0030" n="19"/>
next to a colored woman who sat alone near the door of the
car, some little distance off. It was quite apparent, and it was the fact,
that this colored woman was the servant of the family; and the traveller
appeared to think that, although as an "original question" he might not object
to the proffered seat, yet it was not civil for a man to offer him what he
would not use himself. The scene closed by the traveller's taking a seat
with another gentleman, I mention this incident because it is getting to
be too common for people to claim much more room than belongs to them, and
because I have seen persons who are modest and unused to travelling subjected
to considerable annoyance in consequence. Moreover, conductors are oftentimes
fishing so much after popularity, that they wink at misconduct in high life.
</p><p>
Somewhere about midnight, along the banks of the Potomac,
and, if I remember right, near the town of Hancock, the cars were detained
for three hours. A collision had occurred twelve hours before, causing an
extensive destruction of cars and freight, and heavy fragments of both lay
scattered over the track. Had it not been for the skilful use of a steam-engine
in dragging off the ruins, we must have waited till the sun was up. Two or
three large fires were kindled with the ruins, so that the scene of the disaster
was entirely visible. And the light shining in the midst of the thick darkness,
near the river, with the crowd of people standing around, 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0031" n="20"/>
was not very romantic,
perhaps not picturesque&mdash;but it was quite novel; and the novelty of the scene
enabled us to bear with greater patience the gloomy delay.
</p><p>
The mountain scenery in plain sight of the traveller over
the Baltimore and Ohio road is more extensive and protracted, and I think
as beautiful, as on any road in the United States. There are as wild places
seen on the road across Tennessee from Nashville, and as picturesque scenes
on the Pennsylvania Central road&mdash;perhaps the White Mountains as seen from
the Atlantic and St. Lawrence road present a more sublime view&mdash;but I think
on the road I speak of, there is more gorgeous mountain scenery than on any
other. On such routes one passes through a rude civilization. The settlements
are small and scattered, exhibiting here and there instances of thrift and
contentment, but generally the fields are small and the houses in proportion.
The habits of the people are perhaps more original than primitive. It was
along the route that I saw farmers gathering their corn on sleds. The cheerful
scene is often witnessed of the whole family&mdash;father, mother, and children&mdash;at
work gathering the crops. These pictures of cottage life in the mountain
glens, with the beautiful variegated foliage of October for groundwork, are
objects which neither weary nor satiate our sight.
</p><p>
The practice of taking a vote for presidential candidates
in the cars has been run into the ground. 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0032" n="21"/>
By this I mean that it has been
carried to a ridiculous excess. So far I have had occasion to vote several
times. A man may be indifferent as to expressing his vote when out of his
state; but a man's curiosity must have reached a high pitch when he travels
through a train of cars to inquire how the passengers vote. It is not uncommon,
I find, for people to carry out the joke by voting with their real opponents.
Various devices are resorted to to get a unanimous vote. For example, a man
will say, "All who are in favor of Buchanan take off their boots; all in
favor of Fremont keep them on." Again, when there are several passengers
on a stage-coach out west, and they are passing under the limbs of a tree,
or low bridge, as they are called, it is not unusual far a Fremont man to
say, "All in favor of Fremont bow their heads."
</p><p>
I have a word to say about refreshments on railroad routes.
It is, perhaps, well known that the price for a meal anywhere on a railroad
in the United States is fifty cents. That is the uniform price. Would that
the meals were as uniform! But alas! a man might as well get a quid of tobacco
with his money, for he seldom gets a <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi></foreign>. Once in a couple
of days' travel you may perhaps get a wholesome meal, but as a general thing
what you get (when you get out of New England) isn't worth over a dime. You
stop at a place, say for breakfast, after having rode all night. The conductor
calls out, "Twenty minutes for breakfast." There is a 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0033" n="22"/>
great crowd and a great
rush, of course. Well, the proprietor expects there will be a crowd, and
ought to be prepared. But how is it? Perhaps you are lucky enough to get
a seat at the table. Then your chance to get something to eat is as one to
thirteen: for as there is nothing of any consequence on the table, your luck
depends on your securing the services of a waiter who at the same time is
being called on by about thirteen others as hungry as yourself. Then suppose
you succeed! First comes a cup of black coffee, strong of water; then a piece
of tough fried beef steak, some fried potatoes, a heavy biscuit&mdash;a little
sour (and in fact everything is sour but the pickles). You get up when you
have finished eating&mdash;it would be a mockery to say when you have satisfied
your appetite&mdash;and at the door stand two muscular men (significantly the
proprietor is aware of the need of such) with bank bills drawn through their
fingers, who are prepared to receive your 50c. It is not unusual to hear
a great deal of indignation expressed by travellers on such occasions. No
man has a right to grumble at the fare which hospitality sets before him.
But when he buys a dinner at a liberal price, in a country where provisions
are abundant, he has a right to expect something which will sustain life
and health. Those individuals who have the privilege of furnishing meals
to railroad travellers probably find security in the reflection that their
patronage does not depend on the will of their patrons. But the evil can
be remedied by the proprietors 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0034" n="23"/>
and superintendents of the roads, and the
public will look for a reformation in dinners and suppers at their hands.
</p><p>
I might say that from Benwood, near Wheeling&mdash;where I arrived
at about four in the afternoon, having been nearly twenty-four hours coming
875 miles&mdash;I passed on to Zanesville to spend the night; thinking it more
convenient, as it surely was, to go to bed at eleven at night and start the
next morning at eight, than to go to bed at Wheeling at nine, or when I chose,
and start again at two in the morning. The ride that evening was pleasant.
The cars were filled with lusty yeomen, all gabbling politics. There was
an overwhelming majority for Fremont. Under such circumstances it was a virtue
for a Buchanan man to show his colors. There was a solid old Virginian aboard;
and his open and intelligent countenance&mdash;peculiar, it seems to me, to
Virginia&mdash;denoted that he was a good-hearted man. I was glad to see him defend
his side of politics with so much zeal against the Fremonters. He argued
against half a dozen of them with great spirit and sense. In spite of the
fervor of his opponents, however, they treated him with proper respect and
kindness. It was between eleven and twelve when I arrived at Zanesville.
I hastened to the Stacy House with my friend, J. E B. (a young gentleman
on his way to Iowa, whose acquaintance I regard it as good luck to have made).
The Stacy House could give us lodgings, but not a mouthful of refreshments.

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0035" n="24"/>
As the next best thing, we descended to a restaurant, which seemed to be
in a very drowsy condition, where we soon got some oyster and broiled chicken,
not however without paying for it an exorbitant price. I rather think, however,
I shall go to the Stacy House again when next I visit Zanesville, for, on
the whole, I have no fault to find with it. Starting at eight the next morning,
we were four hours making the distance (59 miles) from Zanesville to Columbus.
The road passes through a country of unsurpassed loveliness. Harvest fields,
the most luxuriant, were everywhere in view. At nearly every stopping-place
the boys besieged us with delicious apples and grapes, too tempting to be
resisted. We had an hour to spend at Columbus, which, after booking our names
at the Neil House for dinner&mdash;and which is a capital house&mdash;we partly spent
in a walk about the city. It is the capital of the state, delightfully situated
on the Scioto river, and has a population in the neighborhood of 20,000.
The new Capitol there is being built on a scale of great magnificence. Though
the heat beat down intensely, and the streets were dusty, we were "bent on
seeing the town." We&mdash;my friend B. and myself&mdash;had walked nearly half a mile
down one of the fashionable streets for dwellings, when we came to a line
which was drawn across the sidewalk in front of a residence, which, from
the appearance, might have belonged to one of the upper-ten. The line was
in charge of two or three little girls, the 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0036" n="25"/>
eldest of whom was not over twelve.
She was a bright-eyed little miss, and had in her face a good share of that
metal which the vulgar think is indispensable to young lawyers. We came to
a gradual pause at sight of this novel obstruction. "Buchanan, Fillmore,
or Fremont?" said she, in a tone of dogmatical interrogatory. B. was a fervid
Fremonter&mdash;he probably thought she was&mdash;so he exclaimed, "Vermont for ever!"
I awaited the sequel in silence. "Then you may go round," said the little
female politician. "You may go round," and round we went, not a little amused
at such an exhibition of enthusiasm. I remember very well the excitement
during the campaign of 1840; and I did my share with the New Hampshire boys
in getting up decoy cider barrels to humbug the Whigs as they passed in their
barouches to attend some great convention or hear Daniel Webster. But it
seems to me there is much more political excitement during this campaign
than there was in 1840. Flagstaffs and banners abound in the greatest profusion
in every village. Every farm-house has some token of its polities spread
to the breeze.
</p><p>
At twenty minutes past one&mdash;less or more&mdash;we left Columbus,
and after travelling 158 miles, <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Dayton, we came to Indianapolis,
the great "Railroad City," as it is called, of the west. It was half past
nine when we arrived there. I did not have time to go up to the Bates House,
where I once had the pleasure of stopping, but concluded to get supper 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0037" n="26"/>
at
a hotel near the depot, where there was abundant time to go through the ceremony
of eating. It strikes me that Indianapolis would be an agreeable place to
reside in. There are some cities a man feels at home in as soon as he gets
into them; there are others which make him homesick; just as one will meet
faces which in a moment make a good impression on him, or which leave a dubious
or disagreeable impression. That city has 16,000 people. Its streets are
wide, and its walks convenient. All things denote enterprise, liberality,
and comfort. It is 210 miles from Indianapolis to this city, <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Lafayette
and Michigan City. We ought to have made the time in less than twelve hours,
and, but for protracted detentions at Lafayette and Michigan City, we would
have done so. We reached the latter place at daylight, and there waited about
the depot in dull impatience for the Detroit and Chicago train. It is the
principal lake harbor in Indiana.
</p><p>
It is about two years since I was last in Chicago; and
as I have walked about its streets my casual observation confirms the universal
account of its growth and prosperity. I have noticed some new and splendid
iron and marble buildings in the course of completion. Chicago is a great
place to find old acquaintances. For its busy population comprises citizens
from every section of the United States, and from every quarter of the globe.
The number of its inhabitants is now estimated at 100,000. Everybody that
can move is active. It is a city of 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0038" n="27"/>
activity. Human thoughts are all turned
towards wealth. All seem to he contending in the race for riches: some swift
and daring on the open course; some covertly lying low for a by-path. You
go along the streets by jerks: down three feet to the street here; then up
four slippery steps to the sidewalk there. Here a perfect crowd and
commotion&mdash;almost a mob&mdash;because the drawbridge is up. You would think there
was a wonderful celebration coming off at twelve, and that everybody was
hurrying through his work to be in season for it. Last year 20,000,000 bushels
of grain were brought into Chicago. Five years ago there were not a hundred
miles of railroad in the state of Illinois. Now there are more than two thousand.
Illinois has all the elements of empire. Long may its great metropolis prosper!

CHICAGO TO ST. PAUL.</head>

Railroads to the Mississippi&mdash;Securing passage on the steamboat&mdash;The Lady
Franklin&mdash;Scenery of the Mississippi&mdash;Hastings&mdash;Growth of settlements
</p></epigraph>
<opener><dateline><name type="place">ST. PAUL, </name><date value="1856-10">October, 1856.</date></dateline></opener>
<p>
HOW short a time it is since a railroad to the Mississippi
was thought a wonder! And now within the state of Illinois four terminate
on its banks. Of course I started on one of these roads from Chicago to get
to Dunleith. I think it is called the Galena and Chicago Union Road. A good
many people have supposed Galena to be situated on the Mississippi river,
and indeed railroad map makers have had it so located as long as it suited
their convenience&mdash;(for they have a remarkable facility in annihilating distance
and in making crooked ways straight)&mdash;yet the town is some twelve miles from
the great river on a narrow but navigable stream. The extent and importance
of Rockford, Galena, and Dunleith cannot fail to make a strong impression
on the traveller. They are towns of recent growth, and well illustrate that
steam-engine sort of progress peculiar now-a-days in the west. Approaching
Galena we leave the region of level prairie 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0040" n="29"/>
and enter a mineral country of
naked bluffs or knolls, where are seen extensive operations in the lead mines.
The trip from Chicago to Dunleith at the speed used on most other roads would
be performed in six hours, but ten hours are usually occupied, for what reason
I cannot imagine. However, the train is immense, having on board about six
or seven hundred first class passengers, and two-thirds as many of the second
class. Travelling in the cars out west is not exactly what it is between
Philadelphia and New York, or New York and Boston, in this respect: that
in the West more families are found, in the cars, and consequently more babies
and carpet bags.
</p><p>
It may not be proper to judge of the health of a community
by the appearance of people who are seen standing about a railroad station;
yet I have often noticed, when travelling through Illinois, that this class
had pale and sickly countenances, showing too clearly the traces of fever
and ague.
</p><p>
But I wish to speak about leaving the cars at Dunleith
and taking the steamboat for St. Paul. There is a tremendous rush for the
boats in order to secure state-rooms. Agents of different boats approach
the traveller, informing him all about their line of boats, and depreciating
the opposition boats. For instance, an agent, or, if you please, a runner
of a boat called Lucy&mdash;not Long&mdash;made the assertion on the levee with great
zeal and perfect impunity that no other boat but the said Lucy would 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0041" n="30"/>
leave
for St. Paul within twenty-four hours; when it must have been known to him
that another boat on the mail line would start that same evening, as was
actually the fact. But the activity of the runners was needless; for each
boat had more passengers than it could well accommodate. I myself went aboard
the " Lady Franklin," one of the mail boats, and was accommodated with a
state-room. But what a scene is witnessed for the first two hours after the
passengers begin to come aboard! The cabin is almost filled, and a dense
crowd surrounds the clerk's office, just as the ticket office of a theatre
is crowded on a benefit night. Of course not more than half can get state-rooms
and the rest must sleep on the cabin floor. Over two hundred cabin passengers
came up on the Lady Franklin. The beds which are made on the floor are tolerably
comfortable, as each boat is supplied with an extra number of single mattresses.
The Lady Franklin is an old boat, and this is said to be its last season.<ref target="n1.2.1" n="1">1</ref>
Two years ago it was one of the excursion fleet to St. Paul, and was then
in its prime. But steamboats are short lived. We had three tables set, and
those who couldn't get a seat at the first or second sat at the third. There
was a choice you may believe, for such was the havoc made with the provisions
at the first table that the second and third were not the most inviting.
It was amusing to see gentlemen seat themselves 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0042" n="31"/>
in range of the plates as
soon as they were laid, and an hour before the table was ready. But the officers
were polite&mdash;as is generally the case on steamboats till you get down to
the second mate&mdash;and in the course of a day or two, when the passengers begin
to be acquainted, the time wears away pleasantly. We were nearly four days
in making the trip. The line of boats of which the Lady Franklin is one,
carries the mail at fifty dollars a trip. During the boating season I believe
the fare varies from seven to ten dollars to St. Paul.<ref target="n1.2.2" n="2">2</ref> This season there
have been two lines of boats running to Minnesota. All of them have made
money fast; and next season many more boats will run. The "Northern Belle"
is the best boat this season, and usually makes the trip up in two days.
The advertised time is thirty hours.
</p><p>
The scenery on the upper Mississippi is reputed to be
beautiful. So it is. Yet all river scenery is generally monotonous. One gets
tired of looking at high rocky ridges quite as quickly as at more 

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0043" n="32"/>tame and
tranquil scenery. The bluffs on either side of the Mississippi, for most
of the way between Dunleith and St. Anthony's Falls, constitute some of the
most beautiful river scenery in the world. It is seldom that they rise over
two hundred feet from the water level, and their height is quite uniform,
so that from a distant point of view their summit resembles a huge fortification.
Nor, as a general thing, do they present a bold or rocky front. The rise
from the river is gradual. Sometimes they rise to a sharp peak, towards the
top of which crops out in half circles heavy ridges of limestone. The ravines
which seem to divide them into separate elevations, are more thickly wooded,
and appear to have been grooved out by the rolling down of deep waters. The
most attractive feature of these bluffs&mdash;or miniature mountains, as they
might be called&mdash;is their smooth grassy surface, thinly covered over with
shade trees of various kinds. Whoever has seen a large orchard on a hill
side can imagine how the sides of these bluffs look. At this season of the
year the variegated foliage of the trees gives them a brilliant appearance.
It is quite rare to see a bluff which rises gradually enough to admit of
its being a good town site. Hence it is that settlements on the banks of
the river will never be very numerous. Nature has here interposed against
that civilization which adorns the lower Mississippi. It appears to me that
all the available points for town sites on the river are taken up as far
as the bluffs extend; 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0044" n="33"/>
and some of these will require a great amount of excavation
before they can grow to importance.
</p><p>
But there are several thrifty and pleasant villages in
Minnesota, on the river, before reaching St. Paul. The first one of importance
is Brownsville, where, for some time, was a United States land office. It
is 168 miles above Dunleith. Winona, 58 miles farther up, is a larger town.
It is said to contain 5000 population. There is a land office there also.
But the town stands on land which, in very high water, will run too much
risk of inundation. Passing by several other landings and germs of towns,
we come to Wacouta, ninety-eight miles above; which is a successful lumber
depot. Six miles further on is Red Wing, a place which delighted me on account
of its cheerful location. It is growing quite fast, and is the seat of a
large Methodist seminary. But the town of Hastings, thirty-two miles above,
eclipses everything but St. Paul. It is finely located on rising ground,
and the river is there narrow and deep. The boat stopped here an hour, and
I had a good opportunity to look about the place. The town appears to have
considerable trade with the back country. Its streets are laid out with
regularity; its stores and buildings are spacious, durable, and neat. I heard
that over $2000 were asked for several of the building lots. A little way
into the interior of the town I saw men at work on a stone church; and
approaching the spot, I determined to make some inquiries of a boy who was

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0045" n="34"/>
briskly planing boards. First, I asked how much the church was going to cost?
About $3000, he replied.
</p><p>
"Are there any other churches in the place?"
</p><p>
"Yes, up there, where they are building."
</p><p>
"What denomination is that?"
</p><p>
"I don't know," he responded. "I only came into the place
yesterday."
</p><p>
I thought he was doing well to begin to build churches
so soon after his arrival. And from his countenance, I have no doubt he will
do well, and become a useful citizen of the state. Hastings has its democratic
press&mdash;the Dakota Journal, edited by J. C. Dow, a talented young man from
New Hampshire. The population of the town is about two thousand. It is thirty-two
miles below St. Paul, on the west side of the river. There is nothing of
especial interest between the two places.
</p><p>
The great panorama which time paints is but a species of
dissolving views. It is but as yesterday since the present sites of towns
and cities on the shores just referred to showed only the rude huts of Indian
tribes. To-day, the only vestige left there of the Indian are his
burying-grounds. Hereafter the rudeness of pioneer life shall be exchanged
for a more genial civilization, and the present, then the past, will be looked
back to as trivial by men still yearning for the future.

CITY OF ST. PAUL.
</head>
<epigraph><p>
First settlement of St. Paul&mdash;Population&mdash;Appearance of the city&mdash;Fuller
House&mdash;Visitors&mdash;Roads&mdash;Minneapolis&mdash;St. Anthony&mdash;Suspension Bridge.
</p></epigraph>
<opener><dateline><name type="place">FULLER HOUSE, ST. PAUL, </name><date value="1856-10">October, 1856.</date></dateline></opener>
<p>
THE circumstance of finding a good spring of water first
led to the settlement of Boston. It would not be unreasonable to suppose
that a similar advantage induced the first settler of St. Paul to locate
here; for I do not suppose its pioneers for a long while dreamed of its becoming
a place even of its present importance. And here let me mention that St.
Paul is not on the west side of the Mississippi, but on the east. Though
it is rather too elevated and rough in its natural state to have been coveted
for a farm, it is yet just such a spot as a pioneer would like to plant himself
upon, that he might stand in his door and have a broad and beautiful view
towards the south and west. And when the speculator came he saw that it was
at the head of navigation of what be thought was the Upper Mississippi, but
which in reality is only the Middle Mississippi. Then stores were put up,
small and rude, and trade began to increase with settlers and 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0047" n="36"/>
hunters of
furs. Then came the organization of the territory, and the location of the
capital here, so that St. Paul began to thrive still more from the crumbs
which fell from the government table, as also by that flood of emigration
which nothing except the Rocky Mountains has ever stayed from entering a
new territory. And now it has passed its doubtful era. It has passed from
its wooden to its brick age. Before men are certain of the success of a town,
they erect one story pine shops; but when its success appears certain, they
build high blocks of brick or granite stores. So now it is common to see
four and five story brick or stone buildings going up in St. Paul.
</p><p>
I believe this city numbers at present about 10,000 population.
It is destined to increase for a few years still more rapidly than it has
heretofore. But that it will be a second Chicago is what I do not expect.
It would certainly seem that the high prices demanded for building lots must
retard the progress of the place; but I am told the prices have always been
as high in proportion to the business and number of population. $500 and
upwards is asked for a decent building lot in remote parts of the town.
</p><p>
I have had an agreeable stroll down upon the bluff, south-east
from the city, and near the elegant mansion of Mr. Dayton. The first engraving
of St. Paul was made from a view taken at that point. As I stood looking
at the city, I recalled the picture in 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0048" n="37"/>
Mr. Bond's work, and contrasted its
present with the appearance it had three or four years ago. What a change!
Three or four steamers were lying at the levee; steam and smoke were shooting
forth from the chimneys of numerous manufactories; a ferry was plying the
Mississippi, transporting teams and people; church steeples and domes and
great warehouses stood in places which were vacant as if but yesterday; busy
streets had been built and peopled; rows of splendid dwellings and villas,
adorned with delightful terraces and gardens, had been erected. I went out
on Sunday morning too, and the view was none the less pleasant. Business
was silent; but the church bells were ringing out their sweet and solemn
melody, and the mellow sunlight of autumn glittered on the bright roofs and
walls in the city. The whole scene revealed the glorious image of that ever
advancing civilization which springs from well rewarded labor and general
intelligence.
</p><p>
Like all new and growing places in the west, St. Paul has
its whiskey shops, its dusty and dirty streets, its up and down sidewalks,
and its never-ceasing whirl of business. Yet it has its churches, well filled;
its spacious school-houses; its daily newspapers; and well-adorned mansions.
There are many cottages and gardens situated on the most elevated part of
the city, north and west, which would not suffer by a comparison with those
cheerful and elegant residences so numerous for six to ten miles around Boston.
From the parlors of these 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0049" n="38"/>
homes one may look down upon the city and upon
the smooth bosom of the river. In the streets, too, you see much evidence
of opulence and luxury, in the shape of handsome carriages, which are set
out to advantage by a first-rate quality of horses.
</p><p>
One element of the success of this city is the public spirit
of its leading business men. They have put their hands deep into their pockets
to improve and advance the place. In all their rivalry there is an amicable
feeling and boundless liberality. They help him that tries to help himself,
and help each other in a way that will help them all together; and such kind
of enterprises produces grand results. Why, here is a new hotel (the Fuller
House) at which I stop, which is surpassed but by very few hotels in the
country. It is a first-class house, built of brick, five stories high, and
of much architectural beauty. The building itself cost upwards of $100,000,
and its furniture over $30,000. Its proprietor is Mr. Long, who has already
had good success in this sort of business. One can well imagine the comfort
of finding such a house at the end of a long and tedious journey in a new
country.
</p><p>
It is estimated that 28,000 people have visited and left
St. Paul during the present season. During July and August the travel diminishes,
but as soon as autumn sets in it comes on again in daily floods. It is really
a novel and interesting state of things one finds on his arrival at the hotel.
There are so many people from so many different places! Then 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0050" n="39"/>
everybody is
a stranger to almost everybody, and therefore quite willing to get acquainted
with somebody. Everybody wants a bit of information on some point. Everybody
is going to some place where he thinks somebody has been or is going, and
so a great many new acquaintances are made without ceremony or delay; and
old acquaintances are revived. I find people who have come from all sections
of the country&mdash;from the east and the west, and from the south&mdash;not adventurers
merely, but men of substance and means, who seek a healthier climate and
a pleasant home. Nor can I here omit to mention the meeting of my friend,
Col. A. J. Whitney, who is one of the pioneers of Minnesota, and with whom
I had two years before travelled over the western prairies. A. H. Marshall,
Esq., of Concord, N. H., well known as a popular speaker, is also here on
a visit.
</p><p>
But what are the roads leading from St. Paul, and what
are the facilities of travel to places beyond? These are questions which
I suppose some would like to have answered. There is a road to Stillwater,
and a stage, which I believe runs daily. That is the route now often taken
to Lake Superior. This morning three men came in on that stage from Superior,
who have been a week on the journey. The great highway of the territory extends
as far as Crow Wing, 130 miles north of here. It passes St. Anthony and several
important towns on the eastern bank of the Mississippi. In a day or two I
intend 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0051" n="40"/>
to take a journey as far as Crow Wing, and I can then write with more
knowledge on the subject.
</p><p>
A very pretty drive out of St. Paul is by the cave. This
is an object worth visiting, and is about two miles out of the city. Three
or four miles beyond are the beautiful falls of Minnehaha, or laughing water.
The drive also takes in Fort Snelling. St. Anthony is on the east side of
the Mississippi; Minneapolis is opposite, on the west side. Both places are
now large and populous. The main street of St. Anthony is over a mile in
length. One of the finest water powers in the Union is an element of growth
to both towns. The lumber which is sawed there is immense. A company is
undertaking to remove the obstructions to navigation in the river between
St. Paul and St. Anthony. $20,000 were raised for the purpose; one-half by
the Steamboat Company, and the other half by the people of St. Anthony. The
suspension bridge which connects Minneapolis with St. Anthony is familiar
to all. It is a fit type of the enterprise of the people. I forget the exact
sum I paid as toll when I walked across the bridge&mdash;perhaps it was a dime;
at any rate I was struck with the answer given by the young man who took
the toll, in reply to my inquiry as I returned, if my coming back wasn't
included in the toll paid going over? " No," said he, in a very good-natured
way, "we don't know anything about coming back; <hi rend="italic">it's all go ahead in this
country."</hi>

THE BAR.</head>
<epigraph><p>

practice&mdash;Courts&mdash;Recent legislation of Congress as to the territorial
judiciary&mdash;The code of practice&mdash;Practice in land cases&mdash;Chances for lawyers
in the West&mdash;Charles O'Connor&mdash;Requisite qualifications of a lawyer&mdash;The

<opener><dateline><name type="place">ST. PAUL, </name><date value="1856-10">October, 1856.</date></dateline></opener>
<p>
I HAVE not yet been inside of a court of justice, nor seen
a case tried, since I have been in the territory. But it has been my pleasure
to meet one of the judges of the supreme court and several prominent members
of the bar. My impression is, that in point of skill and professional ability
the Minnesota bar is a little above the average of territorial bars. Here,
as in the West generally, the practice is common for lawyers to mix with
their profession considerable miscellaneous business, such as the buying
and selling of land. The law is too jealous a mistress to permit any divided
love, and therefore it cannot be expected that really good lawyers will be
found in the ranks of general business agents and speculators. In other words,
a broker's 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0053" n="42"/>
office is not a lawyer's office. There are some lawyers here who
have attended strictly to the profession, who are ornaments of it, and who
have met with good success. The idea has been common, and as fatal as common,
that success in legal practice could be easily attained in the West with
a small amount of skill and learning. It is true that a poor lawyer aided
by some good qualities will sometimes rise to affluence and eminence, though
such cases are exceptions. There are able layers in the West, and, though
practice may be less formal and subtle than in older communities, ability
and skill find their relative advancement and reward, while ignorance and
incapacity have their downward tendency just as they do everywhere else.
The fees for professional services are liberal, being higher than in the
East. Before an attorney can be admitted to practise he must have an examination
by, or under the direction of, one of the judges of the supreme court. The
provisions of the territorial statutes are quite strict in their tendency
to maintain upright practice.
</p><p>
An act of the present congress has created a revolution
in the courts of the territory. The organic act, SS 9, provided that the
territory should be divided into three judicial districts; "and a district
court shall be held in each of said districts by one of the justices of the
supreme court, at such times and places <hi rend="italic">as may be prescribed by law."
</hi>This meant, I suppose, at such times and places as 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0054" n="43"/>
    the territorial
legislature should prescribe. Accordingly, as population increased and extended,
and as counties were established, the territorial legislature increased the
places in each district for holding the district court. Either on account
of the expense or for some other cause congress has just stepped aside from
the doctrine of non-intervention (ch. 124, sec. 5), and abrogated the territorial
legislation so far as to provide that there shall be but one place in each
of the three districts for holding a district court. The act applies to all
territories. In a territory of five or six hundred miles in extent it is
of course inconvenient to have but three places for holding courts. The
Minnesotians complain that it is an interference with popular sovereignty.
It is possible the legislature might have gone to an extreme in creating
places for holding courts; and I suppose the judges were kept on the march
a good deal of the time. It also looks as if the remedy by congress was extreme.
The people say it is a coercive measure to drive them into a state organization.
</p><p>
The administration of justice is secured by a system which
is now common to all the territories, with the exception of Kansas. The supreme
court consists of the three district judges in full bench. They hold nisi
prius terms in their respective districts, which are called district courts.
The judges have a salary of $2000 each, and are appointed for a term of four
years, subject to removal by the President. 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0055" n="44"/>
The district courts have chancery
jurisdiction in matters where there is not a plain, adequate, and complete
remedy at law. (Stat. of Min. ch. 94, sec. 1.) There are also probate courts.
Each county has two justices of the peace, who are elected by the people.
And I cannot but remark how much better the practice is to elect or appoint
a few justices of the peace rather than to allow the office to be degraded
by wholesale appointments, as a matter of compliment, according to the usage
too common in some Eastern States. The justices of the peace have jurisdiction
in civil cases where the amount in question does not exceed $100; and when
the amount at issue is over $20 either party may demand a jury of six men
to try the case. But there would be little demand for juries if all magistrates
were as competent as our enlightened friend Judge Russell.
</p><p>
Special pleading never flourished much in the West. It
was never "a favorite with the court" out this way; while the regard which
the lawyers have cherished for it has been "distant and respectful." It has
been laid on the shelf about as effectually as bleeding in the practice of
medicine. The science of special pleading, as it is known in these days&mdash;and
that in some of the older states&mdash;exists in a mitigated form from what it
did in the days of Coke and Hale. The opportunities to amend, and the various
barriers against admitting a multiplicity of pleas, have rendered the system
so much more 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0056" n="45"/>
rational than it once was, that it is doubtful if some of the
old English worthies could now identify it. Once a defendant could plead
to an action of assumpsit just as many defences as he chose; first, he could
deny the whole by pleading the general issue; then he could plead the statute
of limitations, infancy, accord and satisfaction, and a dozen other pleas,
by which the plaintiff would be deprived of any clue to the real defence.
I suppose it was this practice of formal lying which has given rise to the
popular error that a lawyer is in the habit of lying, or is obliged to lie,
in his arguments. Many people do not know the difference between
<hi rend="italic">pleading</hi>&mdash;which is a process in writing to bring the parties to an
issue&mdash;and the oral arguments of counsel in courts. It is ridiculous to suppose
that it is easy or profitable for lawyers to make false statements in their
arguments. The opposing counsel is ready to catch at anything of the kind;
and if he misstates the evidence, the jury are aware of it; while if he states
what is not law, the court generally knows it. So there is no opportunity
for lying even if a lawyer should be so disposed. The practice in civil actions
as provided by the statutes of Minnesota is similar&mdash;if not actually the
same&mdash;to the New York code of practice. There is but one form of action,
called an action of contract. The only pleading on the part of the plaintiff
is, 1st, the complaint; 2d, the reply. On the part of the defendant, 1st,
demurrer; or 2d, the answer. (Stats. ch. 70, sec. 58.) The complaint 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0057" n="46"/>
must
contain, 1st, the title of the cause, specifying the name of the court in
which the action is brought and the names of the parties to the action, plaintiff
and defendant; 2d, a statement of the facts constituting the cause of action
in ordinary and concise language, without repetition, and in such a manner
as to enable a person of common understanding to know what is intended; 3d,
a demand of the relief to which the plaintiff supposes himself entitled.
If the recovery of money be demanded the amount must be stated. (Ibid. sec.
59.)
</p><p>
While testifying my approval of this code of practice as
a whole, I cannot resist saying that in many respects it is not so systematic
as the Massachusetts code, which was devised by Messrs. Curtis (now Mr. Justice),
Lord, and Chapman. That code is one of the best in the world. And if I may
be allowed one word more about special pleading, I would say that there is
no branch of law which will better reward study. Without mentioning the practice
in the U. S. courts, which requires, certainly, a knowledge of special pleading,
no one can read the old English reports and text books with much profit,
who is ignorant of the principles of that science.
</p><p>
A class of business peculiar to new territories and states
arises from the land laws. A great many pre-emption cases are contested before
the land officers, in which the services of lawyers are required. This fact
will partly explain why there are, generally, so many lawyers located in
the vicinity of a 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0058" n="47"/>
land office. In a community that is newly settled the title
to property must often be in dispute; and however much averse people may
be to going to law, they find it frequently indispensable, if they wish to
have their rights settled on a firm basis.
</p><p>
The opinion prevails almost universally in the East that
a lawyer can do best in the West. In some respects he can. If he cannot do
a good deal better, he is not compensated for going. I had the pleasure of
a conversation last summer with one of the most eminent members of the New
York bar (Mr. O'Connor), on this very subject. It was his opinion that western
lawyers begin sooner to enjoy their reputation than the lawyers in the eastern
cities. This is true; and results from there being less competition in newer
communities. "A lawyer among us," said Mr. O'Connor, "seldom acquires eminence
till he begins to turn gray." Nevertheless, there is no field so great and
so certain in the long run, in which one may become really a great lawyer,
as in some of our large commercial cities, whether of the East or the West.
To admit of the highest professional eminence there must be a large and varied
business; and a lawyer must devote himself almost exclusively to law. And
then, when this great reputation is acquired, what does it amount to? Something
now, but not much hereafter. The great lawyer lives a life of toil and
excitement. Often does it seem to "break on the fragments of a reviving dream."
His nerves are worn by the troubles of others; for 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0059" n="48"/>
the exercise of the
profession, as has been said by a brilliant lawyer, "involves intimate
participation with the interests, hopes, fears, passions, affections, and
vicissitudes of many lives." And yet merely as a lawyer, he seldom leaves
any durable vestige of his fame behind him&mdash;hardly a fortune. But if his
fame is transient and mortal, there is some equivalent in the pleasure of
triumph and the consciousness of power. There is no man so powerful as the
great lawyer. The wealth and the character of his fellow men often depend
upon him. His clients are sometimes powerful corporations, or cities, or
states. Crowded courts listen to his eloquence year after year; and no one
has greater freedom of speech than he. The orator and politician may be wafted
into a conspicuous place for a brief period, and fall again when popular
favor has cooled; yet the lawyer is rising still higher, nor can the rise
and fall of parties shake him from his high pedestal; for the tenure of his
power is not limited. He is, too, one of the most serviceable protectors
of the liberties of his country. It was as a lawyer that Otis thundered against
writs of assistance. The fearless zeal of Somers, in defence of the seven
bishops, fanned the torch of liberty at the beginning of the great English
revolution. Erskine and Brougham did more as lawyers to promote freedom of
the press, than as Statesmen.
</p><p>
I cannot refrain from inserting here Mr. Justice Talfourd's
interesting analysis of the professional 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0060" n="49"/>
abilities of Follett: "It may be
well, while the materials for investigation remain, to inquire into the causes
of success, so brilliant and so fairly attained by powers which have left
so little traces of their progress. Erskine was never more decidedly at the
head of the common law bar than Follett; compared with Follett he was
insignificant in the house of commons; his career was chequered by vanities
and weaknesses from which that of Follett was free; and yet even if he had
not been associated with the greatest constitutional questions of his time
and their triumphant solution, his fame would live by the mere force and
beauty of his forensic eloquence as long as our language. But no collection
of the speeches of Follett has been made; none will ever be attempted; no
speech he delivered is read, except perchance as part of an interesting trial,
and essential to its story, and then the language is felt to be poor, the
cadences without music, and the composition vapid and spiritless; although,
if studied with a view to the secrets of forensic success, with a 'learned
spirit of human dealing,' in connexion with the facts developed and the
difficulties encountered, will supply abundant materials for admiration of
that unerring skill which induced the repetition of fortunate topics, the
dexterous suppression of the most stubborn things when capable of oblivion,
and the light evasive touch with which the speaker fulfilled his promise
of not forgetting others which could not be passed over, but which, if deeply
considered, 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0061" n="50"/>
might he fatal. If, however, there was no principle of duration
in his forensic achievements, there can be doubt of the esteem in which they
were held or the eagerness with which they were sought. His supremacy in
the minds of clients was more like the rage of a passion for a youthful Roscius
or an extraordinary preacher, than the result of deliberate consideration;
and yet it prevailed, in questions not of an evening's amusement, but of
penury or riches, honor or shame. Suitors were content, not only to make
large sacrifices for the assured advantage of his advocacy, but for the bare
chance&mdash;the distant hope&mdash;of having some little part (like that which Phormio
desires to retain in Thais) of his faculties, with the certainty of preventing
their opposition. There was no just ground, in his case, for the complaint
that he received large fees for services he did not render; for the chances
were understood by those who adventured in his lottery; in which after all
there were comparatively few blanks. His <hi rend="italic">name</hi> was 'a tower of strength,'
which it was delightful to know that the adverse faction wanted, and which
inspired confidence even on the back of the brief of his forsaken junior,
who bore the burden and heat of the day for a fifth of the fee which secured
that name. Will posterity ask what were the powers thus sought, thus prized,
thus rewarded, and thus transient? They will be truly told that he was endowed,
in a remarkable degree, with some moral qualities which smoothed his course

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0062" n="51"/>
and charmed away opposition, and with some physical advantages which happily
set off his intellectual gifts; that he was blessed with a temper at once
gentle and even; with a gracious manner and a social temperament; that he
was without jealousy of the solid or showy talents of others, and willingly
gave them the amplest meed of praise; that he spoke with all the grace of
modesty, yet with the assurance of perfect mastery over his subject, his
powers, and his audience; and yet they will scarcely recognise in these
excellencies sufficient reasons for his extraordinary success. To me, the
true secret of his peculiar strength appeared to lie in the possession of
two powers which rarely co-exist in the same mind&mdash;extraordinary subtlety
of perception and as remarkable simplicity of execution. In the first of
these faculties&mdash;in the intuitive power of common sense, which is the finest
essence of experience, whereby it attains 'to something of prophetic strain'&mdash;he
excelled all his contemporaries except Lord Abinger, with whom it was more
liable to be swayed by prejudice or modified by taste, as it was adorned
with happier graces. The perfection of this faculty was remarkably exemplified
in the fleeting visits he often paid to the trials of causes which he had
left to the conduct of his juniors; a few words, sometimes a glance, sufficed
to convey to his mind the exact position of complicated affairs, and enabled
him to decide what should be done or avoided; and where the interference
of any other moral 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0063" n="52"/>
advocate would have been dangerous, he often rendered
good service, and, which was more extraordinary, never did harm. So his
unrivalled aptitude for legal reasoning, enabled him to deal with authorities
as he dealt with facts; if unprepared for an argument, he could find its
links in the chaos of an index, and make an imposing show of learning out
of a page of Harrison; and with the aid of the interruptions of the bench,
which he could as dexterously provoke as parry, could find the right clue
and conduct a luminous train of reasoning to a triumphant close. His most
elaborate arguments, though not comparable in essence with those of his chief
opponent, Lord Campbell&mdash;which, in comprehensive outline, exact logic, felicitous
illustration, and harmonious structure, excelled all others I have heard&mdash;were
delivered in tones so nicely adapted to the minds and ears of the judges,
with an earnestness so winning, and a confidence so contagious, that they
made a judgment on his side not only a necessity, but a pleasure.
</p><p>
"The other faculty, to which, in combination with his subtlety
of understanding, the excellence of his advocacy may be attributed, is one
more rarely possessed&mdash;and scarcely ever in such association&mdash;the entire
singleness of a mind equally present in every part of a cause. If the promotion
of the interest of the client were an advocate's highest duty, it would be
another name for the exactest virtue; and inasmuch as that interest is not,
like the objects of 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0064" n="53"/>
moral zeal, fixed in character, but liable to frequent change,
the faculty of directing the whole power of the understanding to each shifting
aspect of the cause in its minutest shadowings without the guidance of an
inflexible law, is far more wonderful, if far less noble, than a singleness
of devotion to right. It has an integrity of its own, which bears some affinity
to that honesty which Baillie Nichol Jarvie attributes to his Highland kinsman.
Such honesty&mdash;that is, the entire devotion of all the faculties to the object
for which it was retained, without the lapse of a moment's vanity or indolence,
with unlimited vision and unceasing activity&mdash;was Follett's beyond all other
advocates of our time. To the presentment of truth, or sophism, as the cause
might require, he gave his entire mind with as perfect oblivion of self as
the most heroic sufferer for principle. The faculty which in Gladstone, the
statesman, applied to realities and inspired only by the desire to discover
the truth and to clothe it in language, assumes, in the minds of superficial
observers, the air of casuistry from the nicety of its distinctions and the
earnest desire of the speaker to present truth in its finest shades&mdash;in Follett,
the advocate, applied indiscriminately to the development of the specious
shows of things as of their essences, wore all the semblance of sincerity;
and, in one sense, deserved it. No fears, no doubts, no scruples shook him.
Of the license which advocacy draws from sympathy 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0065" n="54"/>
with the feelings of those
it represents, he made full use, with unhesitating power; for his reason,
of 'large discourse,' was as pliable as the affections of the most sensitive
nature. Nor was he diverted from his aim by any figure or fancy: if he neither
exalted his subject by imagination, nor illustrated it by wit, nor softened
its details by pathos, he never made it the subject of vain attempts at the
exhibition of either. He went into the arena, stripped of all encumbrance,
to win, and contended studious only and always of victory. His <hi rend="italic">presence
of mind</hi> was not merely the absence of external distraction, nor the capacity
of calling up all energies on an emergency, but the continued application
of them equally to the duty of each moment. There are few speakers, even
of fervid sincerity and zeal, whose thoughts do not frequently run before
or beside the moment's purpose; whose wits do not sometimes wander on to
some other part of the case than that they are instantly discussing; who
do not anticipate some future effect, or dally with some apprehension of
future peril, while they should consider only the next word or sentence.
This momentary desertion of the exact purpose never occurred to Follett;
he fitted the thought to its place; the word to the thought; and allowed
the action only to take care of itself, as it always will with an earnest
speaker. His, therefore, was rather the artlessness than the art of advocacy&mdash;its
second 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0066" n="55"/>
nature&mdash;justly appreciated by those to whose interests it was devoted;
but not fully understood even by the spectator of its exertion; dying with
the causes in which it was engaged, and leaving no vestiges except in their
success. Hence the blank which is substituted for the space he filled in
human affairs. The modest assurance, the happy boldness, the extemporaneous
logic, all that 'led but to the grave,' exist, like the images of departed
actors, only in the recollection of those who witnessed them, till memory
shall fade into tradition, and tradition dwindle down to a name." (Supplement
to Vacation Rambles, p. 115.) The eagerness with which the talents of Sir
William Follett were sought, forcibly illustrates the truth of a remark,
made to me in the course of some friendly advice, by one who may be ranked
among the most brilliant advocates who have adorned the American Bar (now
in the highest office in the nation), that to attain the highest rank in
the legal profession, a lawyer must have such abilities and character as
will "compel" patronage.
</p><p>
He, however, who enters the profession here or elsewhere
merely as a stepping stone to political preferment, need not expect great
success, even though he may acquire some temporary advancement. The day is
past when lawyers could monopolize every high place in the state. The habit
of public speaking is not now confined to the learned professions. Our peculiar
system of education has 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0067" n="56"/>
trained up a legion of orators and politicians outside
of the bar. Now-a-days a man must have other qualifications besides the faculty
of speech-making to win the prize in politics. He must be a man of comprehensive
ability, and thoroughly identified with the interests of the people, before
he can secure much popular favor, or else he must be possessed of such shining
talents and character that his fellow men will take a pride in advancing
him to conspicuous and responsible trusts. Let a man have a part or all of
these qualifications, however, and with them the experience and tact of a
lawyer, and he will of course make a more valuable public servant, especially
if he is placed in a deliberative body. The British cabinets have always
relied vastly on the support afforded them in the house of commons by their
attorneys and solicitors general, whether it consisted in the severe and
solemn logic of Romilly, in the cool and ready arguments of Scarlett, or
the acute and irresistible oratory of Sir William Follett. The education
of a lawyer;&mdash;his experience as a manager; his art of covering up weak points,
his ready and adroit style of speaking;&mdash;all serve to make him peculiarly
valuable to his own party, and dangerous to an opposition in a deliberative
body. But the fact that a man is a lawyer does not advance him in politics
so much as it once did. Fortunate it is so! For though learning will always
have its advantages, yet no profession ought to have exclusive 

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0068" n="57"/>privileges.
Nor need the lawyer repine that it is so, inasmuch as it is for his benefit,
if he desires success in the profession, to discard the career of politics.
The race is not to the swift, and he can afford to wait for the legitimate
honors of the bar. I will conclude by saying that I regard Minnesota as a
good field for an upright, industrious, and competent lawyer. For those of
an opposite class, I have never yet heard of a very promising field.

<opener><dateline><name type="place">CROW WING, </name><date value="1856-10">October, 1856.</date></dateline></opener>
<p>
HERE I am, after two days drive in a stage, at the town
of Crow Wing, one hundred and thirty miles, a little west of north, from
St. Paul. I will defer, however, any remarks on Crow Wing, or the many objects
of interest hereabout, till I have mentioned a few things which I saw coming
up. Between St. Paul and this place is a tri-weekly line of stages. The coaches
are of Concord manufacture, spacious and comfortable; and the entire equipage
is well adapted to the convenience of travellers. Next season, the enterprising
proprietors, Messrs. Chase and Allen, who carry the mail, intend establishing
a daily line. I left the Fuller House in the stage at about five in the morning.
There was only a convenient number of passengers till we arrived at St. Anthony,
where we breakfasted; but then our load was more than doubled, and we drove
out with nine inside and about seven outside, with 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0070" n="59"/>
any quantity of baggage.
The road is very level and smooth; and with the exception of encountering
a few small stamps where the track has been diverted for some temporary
impediment, and also excepting a few places where it is exceedingly sandy,
it is an uncommonly superior road. It is on the eastern bank of the Mississippi,
and was laid out very straight. But let me remark that everybody who travels
it seems conscious that it is a government road. There are several bridges,
and they are often driven over at a rapid rate, much to their damage. When
Minnesota shall have a state government, and her towns or counties become
liable for the condition of the roads, people will doubtless be more economical
of the bridges, even though the traveller be not admonished to walk his horse,
or to "keep to the right," &amp;c.
</p><p>
Emerging from St. Anthony, the undulating aspect of the
country ceases, and we enter upon an almost unbroken plain. A leading
characteristic of the scenery is the thin forests of oak, commonly called
oak openings. The soil appears to be rich.
</p><p>
Seven miles from St. Anthony is a tidy settlement called
Manomin, near the mouth of Rice river. But the first place of importance
which we reached is Anoka, a large and handsome village situated on Rum river.
It is twenty-five miles from St. Paul. The river is a large and beautiful
stream and affords good water-power, in the development of which Anoka appears
to thrive. A vast number of pine 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0071" n="60"/>
logs are annually floated down the river
and sawed into lumber at the Anoka mills. The settlers are principally from
Maine. By the treaty of 22d February, 1855, with three bands of the Chippewa
Indians, an appropriation of $5000 was set apart for the construction of
a road from the mouth of Rum river to Mille Lac. The road is half completed.
</p><p>
We took an early dinner at Itasca, having come thirty-two
miles. Itasca is quite an unassuming place, and not so pretty as its name.
But I shall always cherish a good-will for the spot, inasmuch as I got a
first-rate dinner there. It was all put upon the table before we sat down,
so that each one could help himself; and as it consisted of very palatable
edibles, each one did help himself quite liberally. We started on soon
afterwards, with a new driver and the third set of horses; but with the
disagreeable consciousness that we had still before us the largest part of
the day's journey. In about three hours we came to Big Lake, or, as it is
sometimes called, Humboldt. The lake is anything but a big lake, being the
size of a common New England pond. But then all such sheets of water are
called lakes in this part of the country. It is a clear body of water, abounding
with fine fish, and has a beautiful shore of pebbles. Several similar sheets
of water are passed on the journey, the shores of which present a naked
appearance. There is neither the trace of a stream leading from or to them,
nor, with few exceptions, even a swamp in their vicinity.
</p><p>

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0072" n="61"/>
Sauk Rapids is 44 miles from Itasca, and it was late when
we reached there. But, late as it was, we found a large collection of people
at the post office waiting for the mail. They appeared to have had a caucus,
and were discussing politics with much animation. There is at Sauk Rapids
a local land office. That is of more advantage to a place than being the
county seat. In a short time, however, some of the land offices will be removed
further west for the convenience of settlers. The village is finely situated
on rising ground, and contains some handsome residences.
</p><p>
It was midnight when we arrived at Watab, where we were
to lodge. The weather had been delightful during the day, but after nightfall
a high wind rose and filled the air with dust. I descended from the stage&mdash;for
I had rode upon the outside&mdash;with self-satisfied emotions of having come
eighty-two miles since morning. The stage-house was crowded. It is a two-story
building, the rooms of which are small. I went to bed, I was about to say,
without any supper. But that was not so. I didn't get any supper, it is true,
neither did I get a bed; for they were all occupied. The spare room on the
floor was also taken. The proprietor, however, was accommodating, and gave
me a sort of a lounge in rather a small room where three or four other men,
and a dog, were sleeping on the floor. I fixed the door ajar for ventilation,
and with my overcoat snugly buttoned around me, though it was not cold, addressed

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0073" n="62"/>
myself to sleep. In the morning I found that one of the occupants was an
ex-alderman from the fifth ward of New York; and that in the room over me
slept no less a personage than Parker H. French. I say I ascertained these
facts in the morning. Mr. French came to Watab a few weeks ago with a company
of mechanics, and has been rushing the place ahead with great zeal. He appears
to make a good impression on the people of the town.
</p><p>
A heavy rain had fallen during the night; the stage was
but moderately loaded, and I started out from Watab, after breakfast the
next morning, in bright spirits. Still the road is level, and at a slow trot
the team makes better time than a casual observer is conscious of. Soon we
came to Little Rock River, which is one of the crookedest streams that was
ever known of. We are obliged to cross it twice within a short space. Twelve
miles this side we cross the beautiful Platte River. It would make this letter
much more monotonous than it is, I fear, were I to name all the rivers we
pass. They are very numerous: and as they increase the delight of the traveller,
so are they also a delight and a convenience to the settler. Like the rivers
of New England, they are clear and rapid, and furnish abundant means for
water-power. The view which we catch of the Mississippi is frequent, but
brief, as the road crosses its curves in the most direct manner. Much of
the best land on either side of 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0074" n="63"/>
the road is in the hands of speculators,
who purchased it at public sale, or afterwards plastered it over with land
warrants. There is evidence of this on the entire route; for, although we
pass populous villages, and a great many splendid farms, the greater part
of the land is still unoccupied. The soil is dark colored, but in some places
quite mealy; everywhere free from stones, and susceptible of easy cultivation.
</p><p>
We arrived at Swan River at about one o'clock, where we
dined on wild ducks. That is a village also of considerable importance; but
it is not so large as Little Falls, which is three miles this side. At that
place the Mississippi furnishes a good water power. It has a spacious and
tidy hotel, several stores, mechanics' shops, a saw-mill, &amp;c. At Belle
Prairie we begin to see something of the Chippewas. The half-breeds have
there some good farms, and the school-house and the church denote the progress
of civilization. It was near sunset when we reached Fort Ripley. The garrison
stands on the west bank of the Mississippi, but the reservation extends several
miles on both sides. The stage crosses the river on the ferry to leave the
mail and then returns. The great flag was still flying from the high staff,
and had an inspiring influence. Like most of our inland military posts, Port
Ripley has no stone fortifications. It is neatly laid out in a square, and
surrounded by a high protective fence. Three 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0075" n="64"/>
or four field-pieces stand upon
the bank of the river fronting it, and at some distance present a warlike
attitude. The rest of the trip, being about five miles, was over the reservation,
on which, till we come to Crow Wing, are no settlements. Here I gladly alighted
from the coach, and found most comfortable and agreeable entertainment at
a house which stands on the immediate bank of the river.

THE TOWN OF CROW WING.</head>

of the town&mdash;Upper navigation&mdash;Mr. Beaulieu&mdash;Washington's theory as to
Norfolk&mdash;Observations on the growth of towns.
</p></epigraph>
<opener><dateline><name type="place">CROW WING, </name><date value="1856-10">October, 1856.</date></dateline></opener>
<p>
I AM highly gratified with the appearance of this place.
Mr. Burke says&mdash;" In order that we should love our country, our country should
first be lovely," and there is much wisdom in the remark. Nature has done
so much for this locality that one could be contented to live here on quite
a moderate income. The land is somewhat elevated, near the bank of the
Mississippi, affording a pleasant view over upon the western side, both above
and below the two graceful mouths of the Crow Wing River. Towards the east
and north, after a few miles, the view is intercepted by a higher ridge of
land covered with timber; or, by the banks of the Mississippi itself, as
from this point we begin to ascend it in a northeasterly course.
</p><p>
Crow Wing was selected as a trading post upwards of twenty
years ago. Mr. McDonnald, who 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0077" n="66"/>
still resides here, was, I believe, the first
white settler. Till within a recent period it was the headquarters of the
Mississippi tribe of Chippewas, and the principal trading depot with the
Chippewas generally. Here they brought their furs, the fruits of their buffalo
and their winter hunts, and their handicraft of beads and baskets, to exchange
for clothing and for food. Thus the place was located and settled on long
before there was a prospect of its becoming a populous town. Mr. Rice, the
delegate in congress, if I mistake not, once had a branch store here with
several men in his employ. The principal traders at present are Mr. Abbee
and Mr. Beaulieu, who have large and well selected stocks of goods. The present
population of white persons probably numbers a hundred souls. The place now
has a more populous appearance on account of the presence of a caravan of
Red Lake Indians, who have come down about four hundred miles to trade. They
are encamped round about in tents or birch bark lodges, as it may happen
to be. In passing some of them, I saw the squaws busily at work on the grass
outside of the lodge in manufacturing flag carpets. The former Indian residents
are now removed to their reservation in the fork of the Mississippi and Crow
Wing rivers, where their agency is now established.
</p><p>
The houses here are very respectable in size, and furnished
in metropolitan style and elegance. The farms are highly productive, and
the grazing for 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0078" n="67"/>
stock unequalled. There is a good ferry at the upper end
of the town, at a point where the river is quite narrow and deep. You can
be taken over with a horse for twenty-five cents; with a carriage, I suppose,
the tariff is higher.
</p><p>
Perhaps one cause of my favorable impression of Crow Wing
is the excellent and home-like hotel accommodations which I have found. The
proprietor hardly assumes to keep a public-house, and yet provides his guests
with very good entertainment; and I cannot refrain from saying that there
is no public-house this side of St. Paul where the traveller will be better
treated. Mr. Morrison&mdash;for that is the proprietor's name&mdash;came here fifteen
years ago, having first come into this region in the service of John Jacob
Astor. He married one of the handsomest of the Chippewa maidens, who is now
his faithful wife and housekeeper, and the mother of several interesting
and amiable children. Mr. M. is the postmaster. He has been a member of the
territorial legislature, and his name has been given to a large and beautiful
county. I judge that society has been congenial in the town. The little church,
standing on an eminence, indicates some union of sentiment at least, and
a regard for the higher objects of life. Spring and summer and autumn must
be delightful seasons here, and bring with them the sweetest tranquillity.
Nor are the people shut out from the world in winter; for then there is travel
and intercourse and traffic. So are 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0079" n="68"/>
there pleasures and recreation peculiar
to the season.
</p><p>
But the serene and quiet age of the settlement is near
its close. Enterprise and speculation, with their bustle and turmoil, have
laid hold of it. The clank of the hammer, the whistle of steamboats, the
rattling of carts, heaps of lumber and of bricks, excavations and gratings,
short corners and rough unshapen walks, will usurp the quiet and the regularity
of the place. Indeed a man ought to make a fortune to compensate for residing
in a town during the first years of its rapid building. The streets appear,
on the map, to be well laid out. A number of purchasers of lots are preparing
to build; and a few new buildings are already going up. As near as I am able
to learn, the things which conduce to its availability as a business place
are these&mdash;First, it is the beginning of the Upper Mississippi navigation.
From this point steamboats can go from two to three hundred miles. But they
cannot pass below, on account of the obstructions near Fort Ripley, at Little
Falls, and at Sauk Rapids. This of course is a great element in its future
success, as the country above in the valley of the river is destined to be
thickly settled, and boats will run between this point and the settlements
along the river. It will also be a large lumber market, for the pine forests
begin here and extend along the river banks for hundreds of miles, while
the facility of getting the logs down is unexceptionable. The territory north

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0080" n="69"/>
of Crow Wing is now open for settlers to a great distance, the Indian title
having been extinguished. Two land districts have also been established,
which will be an inducement for fresh emigration. There is no other place
but this to supply these settlements; at least none so convenient. A great
deal of timber will also come down the Crow Wing River, which is a large
stream, navigable three months in the year. Arrangements are complete for
building a steamboat the ensuing winter, at this very place, to begin running
in the spring as far up as Ojibeway. Next season there will be a daily line
of stages between this and St. Paul. I understand also that it is intended
next summer to connect Crow Wing with the flourishing town of Superior by
stage. It will require considerable energy to do this thing; but if it can
be done, it will be a great blessing to the traveller as well as a profit
to the town. The journey from St. Paul to Lake Superior via Crow Wing can
then be performed in three days, while on the usual route it now occupies
a week. Such are some of the favorable circumstances which corroborate the
expectation of the growth of this place. The southern or lower portion of
the town is included within the Fort Ripley reserve, and though several
residences are situated on it, no other buildings can be put up without a
license from the commanding officer; nor can any lots be sold from that portion
until the reserve is cut down. With the upper part of the town it is different.
Mr. C. H. 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0081" n="70"/>
Beaulieu, long a resident of the place, is the proprietor of that
part, and has already, I am informed, made some extensive sales of lots.
He is one of those lucky individuals, who have sagacity to locate on an available
spot, and patience to wait the opening of a splendid fortune.<ref target="n1.6.1" n="3">1</ref>
</p><p>
My observation and experience in regard to town sites have
taught me an important fact: that as much depends on the public spirit, unity
of action, and zeal of the early proprietors, as upon the locality itself.
The one is useless without these helps. General Washington wrote an able
essay to prove the availability of Norfolk, Va., as the great commercial
metropolis of the country. He speculated upon its being the great market
for the West. His imagination pictured out some such place as New York now
is, as its future. The unequalled harbor of Norfolk, and the resources of
the country all around it, extending as far, almost, as thought could reach,
might well have encouraged the theory of Washington. But munificence and
energy and labor have built up many cities since then, which had not half
the natural advantages of Norfolk, while Norfolk is far behind. A little
lack of enterprise, a little lack of harmony and liberality, may, in the
early days of a town, divert business and improvements from a good location,
till in a short time an unheard-of and 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0082" n="71"/>
inferior place totally eclipses it.
Knowing this to be the case, I have been careful in my previous letters not
to give too much importance to many of the town sites which have been commended
to me along my journey. I do not discover any of these retarding circumstances
about Crow Wing. I must conclude at this paragraph, however, in order to
take a horseback ride to the Chippewa agency. In my next I intend to say
something about the Indians, pine timber, and the country above here in general.

<p>
I CONSIDER myself exceedingly fortunate in having had a
good opportunity for observing the condition of the Chippewa Indians. Sometime
ago I saw enough of the Indians in another part of the country to gratify
my curiosity as to their appearance and habits; and as I have always felt
a peculiar interest in their destiny, my present observations have been with
a view to derive information as to the best means for their improvement.
The whole number of Chippewas in Minnesota is not much over 2200. They are
divided into several bands, each band being located a considerable distance
from the other. The Mississippi band live on their reservation, which begins
a few miles above here across the river, while the Pillagor and Lake
Winnibigoshish bands are some three hundred miles further north. The agency
of the Chippewas is on the reservation 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0084" n="73"/>
referred to, a little north of the
Crow Wing River, and six miles distant from this town. To come down more
to particulars, however, and adopt words which people here would use, I might
say that the agency is on Gull River, a very clear and pretty stream, which
flows from a lake of that name, into the Crow Wing. I passed the agency
yesterday, and two miles beyond, in order to visit Pug-o-na-ke-shick, or
Hole-in-the-day, the principal and hereditary chief of the Chippewas. Mr.
Herriman, the agent, resides at the agency, in compliance with the regulation
of the Indian bureau, which requires agents to reside among the Indians.
I strongly suspect there are many people who would think it unsafe to travel
alone among the Chippewas. But people who live about here would ridicule
the idea of being afraid of violence or the slightest molestation from them,
unless indeed the fellows were intoxicated. For my part, a walk on Boston
common on a summer morning could not seem more quiet and safe than a ramble
on horseback among the homes of these Indians. I spoke to a good many. Though
naturally reserved and silent, they return a friendly salutation with a pleasant
smile.
</p><p>
Their old costume is still retained as a general thing.
The blanket is still worn instead of coats. Sometimes the men wear leggins,
but often go with their legs naked. A band is generally worn upon the head
with some ornament upon it. A feather of the war eagle worn in the head-band
of a brave, 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0085" n="74"/>
denotes that he has taken the scalp of an enemy or performed
some rare feat of daring. An Indian does not consider himself in full dress
without his war hatchet or weapons. I meet many with long-stemmed pipes,
which are also regarded as an ornamental part of dress. They appear pleased
to have anything worn about them attract attention. They are of good size,
taller than the Winnebagoes, and of much lighter complexion than tribes living
five hundred miles further south. Herein the philosopher on the cooking of
men is confirmed. Their hair is black, long, and straight; and some are really
good-looking. There are but few who still paint. Those in mourning paint
their faces black. What I have seen of their houses raises high hopes of
their advancement in civilization. We can now begin to lay aside the word
lodge and say house. Over a year ago, Mr. Herriman promised every one a good
cooking stove who would build himself a comfortable house. This promise had
a good effect, for several houses were built. But the want of windows and
several other conveniences, which are proper fixtures, gives their dwellings
a desolate appearance to one who looks to a higher standard of comfort. Of
course I saw a few of the men at the store (for there is a store at the agency),
spending their time, as too many white men do in country villages. Eight
miles beyond the agency, on Gull Lake, is a mission. It has been under the
charge of Rev. J. L. Breck, a gentleman of high culture, and whose 

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0086" n="75"/>enlightened
and humane exertions in behalf of the Indians have received much commendation
both from the agent and Gov. Gorman, the Superintendent. He has been at the
mission four years. While he had the benefit of the school-fund, he had in
his school, under his own roof, 35 pupils; since that was withheld, the number
of pupils has been 22. Mr. Breck will soon remove to Leech Lake, and will
be succeeded by a gentleman who comes well recommended from a theological
institution in Wisconsin. I desired very much to go as far as the mission,
but from Crow Wing and back it would have been thirty miles, and it was otherwise
inconvenient on account of the rain. The Indians are beginning to farm a
little. They begin with gardens. Their support is chiefly from the annuities
paid by the United States, which are principally received in some sort of
dry goods. The goods are furnished by contract, and the price paid for them
is about enough, if all stories are true. They also derive some support from
their fur hunts and by fishing. Buffaloes are still hunted successfully beyond
the Red River of the North. They bring home the furs, and also the best parts
of the meat. The meat is preserved by being partially cooked in buffalo fat,
cut into small pieces, and sewed up very tight in the hide of the animal.
It is called <hi rend="italic">pemmican,</hi> and sells here for twenty-five cents a pound.
It is broken to pieces like pork scraps, and the Indians regard it as a great
luxury.
</p><p>
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0087" n="76"/>
From the agency I hastened on to see Hole-in-the-day
(Pug-o-na-ke-shick, his Indian name, means, literally, <hi rend="italic">Hole-in-the-sky</hi>).
He is a famous chief, having in his youth distinguished himself for bold
exploits and severe endurance. But what most entitles him to attention is
the very exemplary course he has pursued in attempting to carry out the wishes
of the government in bringing his race to the habits of civilized life. It
was principally through his influence that a treaty was made between his
tribe and the United States, and after it went into effect he turned his
attention to farming. Previous to the treaty he was supported as chief by
the tribal revenue. He has succeeded well. Over a year ago the receipts of
what he sold from his farm, aside from what his household needed, amounted
to over two hundred dollars. At length, after riding a mile and a half without
passing a habitation, over a fertile prairie, I came in sight of his house.
He lives near a small lake, and north of him is a large belt of heavy pine
timber. He has an excellent farm, well fenced and well cultivated. His house
is in cottage style, and of considerable length; spacious, neat, and well
furnished. Arriving at the door I dismounted, and inquired of his squaw if
he was at home. She sent her little girl out into the field to call him.
There, indeed, in his cornfield, was he at work. He met me very cordially;
and invited me into a room, where he had an interpretor. We held a protracted
and agreeable conversation 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0088" n="77"/>
on Indian matters. He invited me to dine with
him, and nothing but want of time prevented my accepting his polite invitation.
He was very neatly dressed, and is quite prepossessing in his appearance.
He is younger than I supposed before seeing him. I judge him to be about
thirty-four. He is a man of strong sense, of great sagacity, and considerable
ambition.
</p><p>
There is no reason why the Indians should not speedily
become civilized. Those who have longest lived amongst them, and who best
understand their character, tell me so. I fully believe it. The Indian follows
his wild habits because he has been educated to do so. The education of habit,
familiar from infancy, and the influence of tradition, lead him to the hunt,
and as much to despise manual labor. He does what he has been taught to consider
as noble and honorable, and that is what the most enlightened do. Certainly
his course of life is the most severe and exposed; it is not for comfort
that he adheres to his wild habits. He regards it as noble to slay his hereditary
foe. Hence the troubles which occasionally break out between the Chippewas
and the Sioux. To gain the applause of their tribe they will incur almost
any danger, and undergo almost any privation. Thus, we see that for those
objects which their education has taught them to regard as first and best,
they will sacrifice all their comforts. They have sense enough, and ambition
enough, and fortitude enough. To those they love 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0089" n="78"/>
they are affectionate almost
to excess. Only direct their ambition in the proper way, and they will at
once rise. Teach them that it is noble to produce something useful by their
labor, and to unite with the great family of man to expand arts and to improve
the immortal mind&mdash;teach them that it is noble, that there is more applause
to be gained by it, as well as comfort, and they will change in a generation.
They will then apply themselves to civilization with Spartan zeal and with
Spartan virtues.
</p><p>
In a communication to the secretary of war by Gen. Cass
in 1821, relative to his expedition to the sources of the Mississippi, he
makes the following interesting extract from the journal of Mr. Doty, a gentleman
who accompanied the expedition:&mdash;"The Indians of the upper country consider
those of the Fond-du-Lac as very stupid and dull, being but little given
to war. They count the Sioux their enemies, but have heretofore made few
war excursions.
</p><p>
"Having been frequently reprimanded by some of the more
vigilant Indians of the north, and charged with cowardice, and an utter disregard
for the event of the war, thirteen men of this tribe, last season, determined
to retrieve the character of their nation, by making an excursion against
the Sioux. Accordingly, without consulting the other Indians, they secretly
departed and penetrated far into the Sioux country. Unexpectedly, at night,
t
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0090" n="79"/>
hey came upon a party of the Sioux, amounting to near one hundred men, and
immediately began to prepare for battle. They encamped a short distance from
the Sioux, and during the night dug holes in the ground into which they might
retreat and fight to the last extremity. They appointed one of their number
(the youngest) to take a station at a distance and witness the struggle,
and instructed him, when they were all slain, to make his escape to their
own land, and relate the circumstances under which they had fallen.
</p><p>
"Early in the morning they attacked the Sioux in their
camp, who, immediately sallying out upon them, forced them back to the last
place of retreat they had resolved upon. They fought desperately. More than
twice their own number were killed before they had lost their lives. Eight
of them were tomahawked in the holes to which they had retreated; the other
four fell on the field. The thirteenth returned home, according to the directions
he had received, and related the foregoing circumstances to his tribe. They
mourned their death; but delighted with the bravery of their friends, unexampled
in modern times, they were happy in their grief.
</p>
<cit><q>"This account I received of the very Indian who was of
the party and had escaped."</q><bibl>&mdash;[See Schoolcraft, p. 481.]<ref target="n1.7.1" n="4">1</ref></bibl></cit>

In the contest between the Athenians and the Dorians, an
oracle had declared that the side would triumph whose king should fall. Codrus
the Athenian king, to be more sure of sacrificing himself, assumed the dress
of a peasant, and was soon killed; and the event soon spread dismay among
the enemies of Athens. His patriotism was accounted so great, that the Athenians
declared that there was no man worthy to be his successor, and so abolished
the monarchy. I think the history of the Indians would show instances of
heroism as praiseworthy as can be found in the annals of the ancients. Let
it be remembered, too, that the Spartans knew that an imperishable literature
would hand down their valor to the praise of the world through all the future.
But the Indian looked for the preservation of his exploits only in the songs
and the traditional stories of his tribe.
</p><p>
I allude to these traits because I think it will be agreed,
that whatever race possesses those elements of character which lead them
to pursue with zeal and courage things they have been taught to regard 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0092" n="81"/>
most
creditable, is capable of being civilized. We now pay the Indian for his
lands in agricultural tools, in muskets and powder, in blankets and cheap
calico&mdash;and in education; but the smallest item is education. If half the
money which the government is liable to pay for Indian troubles during the
last year, could be appropriated to a proper system of education, we should
hear of no more serious Indian wars. But I have not time to pursue the subject.
I will say, however, that the present commissioner of Indian affairs, Mr.
Manypenny, is doing a very good work in advancing their condition. The press
ought to bestow some attention on the subject. There are nearly 400,000 Indians
within the United States and territories. If the philanthropy of the age
could spare the blacks for a little while, and help civilize the Indians,
it would be better for all parties. Here is an enterprise for genuine humanity.
</p>
<note id="n1.7.1" n="4"><seg type="note-symbol">1</seg> <p>Pride is a characteristic trait in Indian character. On
a recent occasion when several bands of the Chippewas were at Washington

<p>
IT seems to have been more difficult for countries which
abound in precious metals to attain to great prosperity than for a rich man
to secure eternal felicity. Witness, for instance, the sluggish growth and
degenerate civilization of the South American states. But timber is a fundamental
element of colonial growth. The mines of Potosi cannot compare with it in
value. An abundance of timber and a superabundance of it are two very different
things. Some of the Middle, and what were once Western States, were originally
covered with forests. So of the greater part of New England. In Ohio and
in Michigan timber has been an encumbrance; for there was great labor to
be performed by the settler in clearing the land and preparing it for the
plough; and at this day we see in travelling through each of those states,
as well as in Kentucky, Tennessee, 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0094" n="83"/>
and Missouri, fields planted amidst heavy
timber trees which have been belted that they may wither and die. By an abundance
of timber I mean an ample supply not only for domestic but foreign market;
and with this understanding of the word I will repeat what has often been
said, and what I suppose is well known, that Minnesota has an abundance of
excellent timber. Unlike the gorgeous forests in New Hampshire, which behind
high cliffs and mountain fastnesses defy the woodman, the timber of Minnesota
grows in the valleys of her great rivers and upon the banks of their numerous
tributaries. It is thus easily shipped to a distant market; while the great
body of the land, not encumbered with it, but naked, is ready for the plough
and for the seed. Most of the timber which grows in the region below this
point is hard wood, such as elm, maple, oak, and ash.
</p><p>
There is considerable scrub oak also thinly scattered over
large portions of fertile prairie. To a casual observer these oaks, from
their stunted appearance, would be taken as evidence of poor soil. But the
soil is not the cause of their scrubby looks. It is the devouring fires which
annually sweep over the plains with brilliant though terrific aspect, and
which are fed by the luxuriant grass grown on that same soil. If the oaks
did not draw uncommon nourishment from the soil, it must be difficult for
them to survive such scorchings. It is a consoling thought that these fires
cease in proportion as the 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0095" n="84"/>
country is settled up. The rock maple is indigenous
to the soil; and the Indians have long been in the habit of making sugar
from its sap. The timber most used for fences is tamarack. The pineries may
be said to begin at the mouth of the Crow Wing River; though there is a great
supply on the Rum River. For upwards of a hundred miles above here on the
Mississippi&mdash;more or less dense, the pine forests extend. Captain John Pope,
in the interesting report of his expedition to the Red River of the North,
in 1849, says&mdash;" The pineries of the upper Mississippi are mostly upon its
tributaries, and I think are not found on the west side further south than
the parallel of 46 degrees N. latitude." (The latitude of this place is 46
degrees 16' 50".) "They alternate, even where most abundant, with much larger
tracts of fertile country." Again he says&mdash;"As might be expected from its
alluvial character, there is no pine timber in the valley of the Red River,
but the oak and elm there attain to a size which I do not think I have ever
seen elsewhere." In another place he remarks that "the pineries along the
Crow Wing River are among the most extensive and valuable found on the
tributaries of the Mississippi." Mr. Schoolcraft says of this river, "the
whole region is noted for its pine timber." In speaking of the country on
the St. Louis River, a few miles from where it empties into Lake Superior,
the same gentleman remarks: "The growth of the forest is pines, hemlock,
spruce, birch, oak, and 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0096" n="85"/>
maple." I had heard considerable about Minnesota
lumber, it is true, but I was not prepared to see the pine timber so valuable
and heavy as it is above and about here. The trees are of large growth, straight
and smooth. They are not surpassed by
<q><lg>
<l rend="indent3">                      "The tallest pine,
</l><l>Hewn on Norwegian hills to be the mast
</l><l>Of some great admiral."
</l></lg></q>
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="lat">Cujus est solum ejus est usque ad caelum</foreign></hi>&mdash;whose
the soil, his to the sky&mdash;is a maxim in these pine regions of literal importance.
There is something besides utility also to be mentioned in this connection.
With the exception of swamps, which are few and far between, the timber land
has all the beauty of a sylvan grove. The entire absence of underbrush and
decayed logs lends ornament and attraction to the woods. They are more like
the groves around a mansion in their neat and cheerful appearance; and awaken
reflection on the Muses and the dialogues of philosophers rather than
apprehension of wild beasts and serpents.
</p><p>
The relative importance of the lumber business would hardly
be estimated by a stranger. It has been carried on for at least six years;
and considerable has found its way as far down as St. Louis. It will be asked,
I imagine, if all this timber land, especially the pine, has been sold by
the government; and if not, how it happens that men cut it down and sell
it? I will answer this. The great region of pineries has not yet been surveyed,
much 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0097" n="86"/>
less sold by the government. But notwithstanding this, men have cut
it in large quantities, sold it into a greedy market, and made money, if
not fortunes in the business. As a sort of colorable excuse for cutting timber,
those employed in the business often make a preemption claim on land covered
with it, and many people suppose they have the right to cut as much as they
please after the incipient steps towards preemption. But this is not so.
All that a claimant can do in this respect is to cut wood enough for his
fuel, and timber enough for his own building purposes, until he receives
a patent from the government. Of course it is altogether reasonable and proper
that men should be precluded from doing so until their title in the soil
is complete. Because, until a preemption claim is perfect, or, until the
land has been acquired by some legal title, it is not certain that the claimant
will ultimately secure it or pay any money to the government. But does not
the government do anything to prevent these trespasses? Yes, but all its
attempts are baffled.
</p><p>
For example, last spring a large quantity of splendid lumber
was seized by the United States marshal and sold at public auction. It was
bid off by the lumbermen themselves, who had formed a combination to prevent
its falling into the hands of other purchasers. This combination had no
resistance as I am aware of in the public opinion of the territory, and the
timber was sold to those who had it cut at a price so far below its value
that it didn't 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0098" n="87"/>
pay the expense of the legal proceedings on the part of the
government. This is accounted for in the fact of the exhaustless quantity
of pine timber towards the north; in the demand for it when sawed; and in
the disposition to protect enterprising men, though technically trespassers,
who penetrate into the forest in the winter at great expense, and whose standing
and credit are some guaranty of their ultimate responsibility to the government,
should they not perfect their titles. The business of getting out the timber
is carried on in the winter, and affords employment for a large number of
athletic young men. The price of timber, I ascertained of Mr. P. D. Pratt,
a dealer at St. Paul, is, for the best, $30 per M.; for common, $20.
</p><p>
Most people have seen or been told something of the lumbermen
of Maine. Allowing this to be so, it will not be difficult to comprehend
the condition and character of the lumbermen of Minnesota and the northwest.
But if there is anybody who fancies them to be a set of laborers, such as
build our railroads and dig coal and minerals, he is greatly mistaken. The
difference is in birth and education; between foreigners and native-born
citizens. A difference not in rights and merits, so much as in habits and
character. Born on American soil, they have attended our common schools,
and have the bearing and independence of sovereigns. None but very vigorous
men can endure, or at least attempt to endure, the exposure of living in
the woods all 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0099" n="88"/>
winter and swinging the axe; though by proper care of themselves,
such exercise is conducive to health and strength. Accordingly we find the
lumberman&mdash;I mean of course the practical lumberman&mdash;to be a thick-set, muscular
young man, with a bright eye and florid cheek; in short, one whom we would
call a double-fisted fellow. He is not one of your California boys, but more
affable and domestic, with a shorter beard, and not so great a profusion
of weapons. His dress is snug and plain&mdash;the regular pioneer costume of boots
over the pants, and a thick red shirt in lieu of a coat. His capital stock
is his health and his hands. When in employment he is economical and lays
up his wages. When out of employment and in town, his money generally goes
freely. As a class, the lumbermen are intelligent. They are strong talkers,
for they put in a good many of the larger sort of words; and from their pungent
satire and sledge-hammer style of reasoning, are by no means very facile
disputants. They are preeminently jokers. This is as they appear on their
way to the woods. During the season of their active labor they usually spend
the evening, after a day of hard work, in storytelling or in a game of euchre.
Their wages amount to about two dollars a day, exclusive of board. They have
good living in the woods, the provisions, which are furnished on an ample
scale, being served by male cooks.
</p><p>
While on the subject of lumber, which may possibly 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0100" n="89"/>
interest
some people who wish to redeem the fortunes they have lately lost in Maine
lumber, I ought not to leave unmentioned the valuable cargoes of it which
are floated down the Mississippi. When coming up in the boat I was astonished
to see such stupendous rafts. Large logs are transported by being made into
rafts. At a landing where the boat stopped, I on one occasion attempted to
estimate the number of logs comprised in one of these marine novelties, and
found it to be about eight hundred; the logs were large, and were worth from
five to six dollars each. Here then was a raft of timber worth at least $4000.
They are navigated by about a dozen men, with large paddles attached at either
end of the raft, which serve to propel and steer. Often, in addition to the
logs, the rafts are laden with valuable freights of sawed lumber. Screens
are built as a protection against wind, and a caboose stands somewhere in
the centre, or according to western parlance it might be called a cabin.
Sometimes the raft will be running in a fine current; then only a couple
of hands are on the watch and at the helm. The rest are seen either loitering
about observing the country, or reclining, snugly wrapped up in their blankets.
Some of these rafts must cover as much as two acres. Birnam Wood coming to
Dunsinane was not a much greater phenomenon.

<p>
THERE is one very important section of this territory that
I have not yet alluded to. I mean that part which borders on Lake Superior.
This calls to mind that there is such a place as Superior City. But that
is in Wisconsin, not in Minnesota. From that city (so called, yet city in
earnest it is like to be) to the nearest point in this territory the distance
by water is twelve miles. The St. Louis River is the dividing line for many
miles between Minnesota and Wisconsin. The country round about this greatest
of inland seas is not the most fertile. It is somewhat bleak, on the northern
shore especially, but is nevertheless fat in minerals. On the banks of the
St. Louis River the soil is described, by the earliest explorers as well
as latest visiters, to be good. The river itself, though it contains a large
volume of water, is not adapted to navigation, on account of its rapids.
</p><p>
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0102" n="91"/>
Those who have sailed across Lake Superior to the neighborhood
of 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0103" n="92"/>
Fond-du-Lac appear to have been charmed by the scenery of its magnificent
islands and its rock-bound shores. Most people, I suppose, have heard of
its beautiful cluster of islands called the Twelve Apostles. One peculiar
phenomenon often mentioned is the boisterous condition of its waters at the
shore, which occurs when the lake itself is perfectly calm. The water is
said to foam and dash so furiously as to make it almost perilous to land
in a small boat. This would seem to be produced by some movement of the waters
similar to the flow of the tide; and perhaps the dashing after all is not
much more tumultuous than is seen on a summer afternoon under the rocks of
Nahant, or along the serene coast at Phillips Beach.
</p><p>
The resources of that part of the territory bordering on
the lake, however, are sufficient to induce an extensive, if not a rapid,
settlement of the country. The copper mines afford occupation for thousands
of people now. I have known a young man to clear $40 a month in getting out
the ore. But the labor is hard. Somewhere near Fond-du-Lac is destined to
be a great commercial city. Whether it will be at Superior, which has now
got the start of all other places, or whether it will be at some point within
this territory, is more than can be known at present. But a great town there
is to be, sooner or later; and for this reason, that the distance from Buffalo
to Fond-du-Lac by navigation is about the same as from Buffalo to Chicago,
affording, therefore, as good facilities for water transportation of merchandise
between Fond-du-Lac and the East, as between Chicago and the East. Moreover,
the development of this new agricultural world will tend to that result.
A railroad will then run from that point directly west, crossing the upper
Mississippi as also the Red River of the North at the head of its navigation,
which is at the mouth of the Sioux Wood River.
</p><p>
During the last summer, congress established two new land
districts in the upper part of the territory, called the north-eastern and
the north-western. The former includes the country lying on Lake Superior,
and its land office has been located at Buchanan, a new place just started
on the shore of the lake. The land office for the north-western district
has been located at Ojibeway, a town site situated sixty miles above here,
on the Mississippi, near the mouth of Muddy River. This district includes
the head waters of the Mississippi, and extends west as far as the Red River
of the North. The surveyors have been engaged in either district only a few
weeks. I don't expect there will be any land offered for sale in either district
till spring. While on the subject of land offices, let me observe that the
appointments in them are among the most lucrative under the patronage of
the general government. There is a register and receiver for each office.
They have, each, $500 per annum and fees; the whole not to 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0104" n="93"/>
exceed $3000.
Aside from the official fees, they get much more for private services. They
have more or less evidence to reduce to writing in nearly every preemption
case, for which the general land office permits them to receive private
compensation. It is rather necessary that the local land officers should
be lawyers, as they have frequent occasion to decide on litigated land claims.
</p><p>
Many explorations have been made of the region around the
head waters of the Mississippi, the reports of which have conveyed to the
world attractive information of the country, but information which only
approximated to accuracy. In 1806, Lieut. Pike explored the river as far
as Turtle Lake, and returned, thinking, good easy man, full surely he had
discovered the real source of the river, and yet the source of the river
was more than a hundred miles off in another direction. Lewis and Clarke
had ascended the river previously. In 1820, General Cass, accompanied by
Mr. Schoolcraft, explored the river to Cass Lake; being obliged to stop there
on account of the low stage of water which they heard existed a few days'
journey beyond. Again, in 1832, Mr. Schoolcraft, then superintendent of Indian
affairs, made another expedition, which resulted in his discovery of the
true sources of the river; it being a lake which he named <hi rend="italic">Itasca.</hi> It
has been said that he manufactured this beautiful word out of the last syllables
of <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">veritas </hi></foreign>and the first syllable of <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">caput </hi></foreign>(the true head).
But I have been
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0105" n="94"/>
told that the word was suggested to his mind by an Indian
word signifying breast. Dr. Johnson says, that a traveller in order to bring
back knowledge should take knowledge with him. That is, that he should have
posted himself up to some extent on the country he visits. I hope it will
not require an affidavit for me to prove that I availed myself of the suggestion.
But I must say I have found great pleasure and profit in perusing Mr.
Schoolcraft's narratives of both his expeditions. Though he had the encouragement
of the government, his undertaking was surrounded by many obstacles and some
dangers. His account of the whole country is pleasant and instructive to
the reader, and shows that all he saw produced on his mind a favorable
impression. The arduous services of this gentleman as an explorer have been
of great advantage to the country, and his fine literary talents have given
his adventures an historic fame. Not less deserving of applause either have
been his efforts to promote the welfare of the Indians. He now lives in affluent
circumstances at Washington, and, though suffering under some bodily infirmities,
appears (or did when I saw him) to enjoy life with that serene and rational
happiness which springs from useful employment, and a consciousness that
past opportunities have been improved.

There have been other explorations of this part of the
country at different times by Messrs. Long, Nicollet, and Pope. M. Nicollet
was accompanied and assisted by Mr. (then Lieutenant) Fremont. The reports
made of these explorations afford information which, if extensively known
among the people, would tend to direct a larger emigration into the upper
part of the territory. They often launch off into exclamations as to the
beautiful surface of the country; while their account of native fruits and
the bracing climate and fertile soil picture to the imagination all the elements
of a home.
</p><p>
M. Nicollet was a foreign gentleman who possessed superior
scientific knowledge and a rare zeal to prosecute researches. He made an
exploration through the valley of the St. Peter's and the Missouri; and from
thence to the sources of the Mississippi, in the year 1839. The official
report which he made is a valuable document, but difficult to be obtained.
I shall therefore make a few extracts from it. I should here remark that
M. Nicollet died before he had completed the introduction to his report.
"The Mississippi," he says, "holds its own from its very origin; for it is
not necessary to suppose, as has been done, that Lake Itasca may be supplied
with invisible sources, to justify the character of a remarkable stream,
which it assumes at its issue from this lake. There are five creeks that
fall into it, formed by innumerable streamlets oozing from the clay-beds
at the bases of the hills, that 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0107" n="96"/>
consist of an accumulation of sand, gravel,
and clay, intermixed with erratic fragments; being a more prominent portion
of the great erratic deposit previously described, and which here is known
by the name of <hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="fre">'Hauteurs des Terres'</foreign></hi>&mdash;heights of land.
</p><p>
"These elevations are commonly flat at top, varying in
height from 85 to 100 feet above the level of the surrounding waters. They
are covered with thick forests, in which coniferous plants predominate. South
of Itasca Lake, they form a semicircular region with a boggy bottom, extending
to the south-west a distance of several miles; thence these <hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="fre">Hauteurs des
Terres</foreign></hi> ascend to the north-west and north; and then, stretching to the
north-east and east, through the zone between 47 degrees and 48 degrees of
latitude, make the dividing ridge between the waters that empty into Hudson's
Bay and those which discharge themselves into the Gulf of Mexico. The principal
group of these <hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="fre">Hauteurs des Terres</foreign></hi> is subdivided into several
ramifications, varying in extent, elevation, and course, so as to determine
the hydrographical basins of all the innumerable lakes and rivers that so
peculiarly characterize this region of country.
</p><p>
"One of these ramifications extends in a southerly direction
under the name of <hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="fre">Coteau du Grand Bois;</foreign></hi> and it is this which separates
the Mississippi streams from those of the Red River of the North.
</p><p>
"The waters supplied by the north flank of these heights
of land&mdash;still on the south side of Lake 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0108" n="97"/>
Itasca&mdash;give origin to the five
creeks of which I have spoken above. These are the waters which I consider
to be the utmost sources of the Mississippi. Those that flow from the southern
side of the same heights, and empty themselves into Elbow Lake, are the utmost
sources of the Red River of the North; so that the most remote feeders of
Hudson's Bay and the Gulf of Mexico are closely approximated to each other."
</p><p>
Of the country above Crow Wing, he makes the following
observations, which are not less interesting than instructive: "Over the
whole route which I traversed after leaving Crow Wing River, the country
has a different aspect from that which the banks of the Mississippi above
the falls present. The forests are denser and more varied; the soil, which
is alternately sandy, gravelly, clayey, and loamy, is, generally speaking,
lighter excepting on the shores of some of the larger lakes. The uplands
are covered with white and yellow pines, spruce and birch; and the wet lowlands
by the American larch and the willow. On the slopes of sandy hills, the American
aspen, the canoe birch (white birch), with a species of birch of dwarfish
growth, the alder, and wild rose, extend to the very margin of the river.
On the borders of the larger lakes, where the soil is generally better, we
find the sugar maple, the black and bar oaks (also named overcup white oak,
but differing from the white oak), the elm, ash, lime tree, &amp;c. Generally
speaking, however, this woodland 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0109" n="98"/>
does not extend back farther than a mile
from the lakes. The white cedar, the hemlock, spruce, pine, and fir, are
occasionally found; but the red cedar is scarce throughout this region, and
none, perhaps, are to be seen but on islands of those lakes called by the
Indians Red Cedar Lakes. The shrubbery consists principally of the wild rose,
hawthorn, and wild plum; and raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, and
cranberries are abundant.
</p><p>
"The aspect of the country is greatly varied by hills,
dales, copses, small prairies, and a great number of lakes; the whole of
which I do not pretend to have laid down on my map. * * * * The lakes to
which I have just alluded are distributed in separate groups, or are arranged
in prolonged chains along the rivers, and not unfrequently attached to each
other by gentle rapids. It has seemed to me that they diminish in extent
on both sides of the Mississippi, as we proceed southwardly, as far as 43
degrees of north latitude; and this observation extends to the Arctic region,
commencing at Bear's Lake; or Slave Lake, Winnipeg Lake, &amp;c. It may be
further remarked that the basins of these lakes have a sufficient depth to
leave no doubt that they will remain characteristic features of the country
for a long time to come. Several species of fish abound in them. The white
fish <hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="lat">(Corregonus albus)</foreign></hi> is found in all the deep lakes west of the
Mississippi&mdash;and, indeed, from Lake Erie to the Polar Sea. That which is
taken in Leech Lake is said by amateurs 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0110" n="99"/>
to be more highly flavored than even
that of Lake Superior, and weighs from three to ten pounds.* * * Of all the
Indian nations that I have visited, the Chippewas, inhabiting the country
about the sources of the Mississippi, are decidedly the most favored. Besides
their natural resources (to which I have already referred) of fish, wild
rice, and maple sugar, with the addition of an abundance of game, the climate
is found to be well adapted to the culture of corn, wheat, barley, oats,
and pulse. The potato is of superior quality to that of the Middle States
of the Union. In a trading point of view, the hunt is very profitable. The
bear, the deer and elk, the wolf, the fox, the wolverine, the fisher raccoon,
muskrat, mink, otter, marten, weasel, and a few remaining beavers, are the
principal articles of this traffic." (pp. 58, 64.) To those who are desirous
of perusing this valuable report, and who have access to the congressional
documents, I would say that it may be found in Senate Document 237, 2d Session
of 26th Congress.

A CELEBRATED geographer of the first century wrote, "Germany
is indeed habitable, but is uninhabited on account of the cold." I am not
so certain, but some people have a similar idea of the upper portion of
Minnesota. If there are any, however, thus distrustful of its climate, they
probably live out of the territory. I have no means of knowing what the climate
is here in winter, except from hearsay and general principles. It seems to
be an approved theory, that the farther we approach the west in a northern
latitude the milder becomes the winter. The stage-drivers tell me that the
snow does not fall to such a depth as in the northern part of New England;
that the weather is tolerably uniform; and that the roads are at all times
kept open and much travelled. After all, it is a great way before we come
to the home of the Esquimaux, 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0112" n="101"/>
and the desert of ice where Sir John Franklin
perished.
</p><p>
I will here subjoin the following extract from a letter
addressed to Gov. Stephens by the Hon. Henry M. Rice, the able delegate from
Minnesota. It is dated 3d June, 1854:
</p><p>
"Navigation of the Mississippi River closes from the 10th
to the 25th of November, and opens from the 1st to the 10th of April. That
of the Red River of the North closes from the 1st to 16th November, and opens
from 10th to 25th April. I have often travelled in the winter from St. Paul
to Crow Wing, a distance of one hundred and fifty miles, with a single horse
and sled, without a track, and have never found the snow deep enough to impede
my progress. I have also gone from Crow Wing, beyond the head waters of the
Mississippi, to the waters of the Hudson's Bay, on foot and without snow-shoes.
I spent one entire winter travelling through that region, and never found
the snow over eighteen inches deep, and seldom over nine inches.
</p><p>
"For several years I had trading-posts extending from Lake
Superior to the Red River of the North, from 46 degrees to 49 degrees north
latitude, and never found the snow so deep as to prevent supplies being
transported from one post to another with horses. One winter, north of Crow
Wing, say 47 degrees north latitude, I wintered about sixty head of horses
and cattle without giving them food of any kind except such as they could
procure themselves under the snow. 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0113" n="102"/>
Between the 45th and 49th degrees north
latitude, the snow does not fall so deep as it does between the 40th and
45th degrees; this is easily accounted for upon the same principle that in
the fall they have frosts much earlier near the 40th than they do near the
45th degree. I say this in reference to the country watered by the Mississippi
River. Owing to its altitude the atmosphere is dry beyond belief, which accounts
for the absence of frosts in the fall, and for the small quantity of snow
that falls in a country so far north. Voyageurs traverse the territory from
Lake Superior to the Missouri the entire winter with horses and sleds, having
to make their own roads, and yet with heavy loads are not detained by snow.
Lumbermen in great numbers winter in the pine regions of Minnesota with their
teams, and I have never heard of their finding the snow too deep to prosecute
their labors. I have known several winters when the snow at no time was over
six inches deep."
</p><p>
The Hon. H. H. Sibley, ex-delegate from Minnesota, in a
letter dated at Mendota says: "As our country is for the most part composed
of prairie, it is of course much exposed to the action of the winds. It is,
however, a peculiarity of our climate, that calms prevail during the cold
weather of the winter months; consequently, the snow does not drift to anything
like the extent experienced in New England or northern New York. I have never
believed that railroad communication in this territory would 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0114" n="103"/>
be seriously
impeded by the depth or drift of snow, unless, perhaps, in the extreme northern
portion of it." (See Explorations and Surveys for the Pacific Railroad, I.,
400.)
</p><p>
A few facts in regard to the people who live four or five
hundred miles to the north, will best illustrate the nature of the climate
and its adaptedness to agriculture.
</p><p>
It is common to say that settlements have not extended
beyond Crow Wing. This is only technically true. There is a settlement at
Pembina, where the dividing line between British America and the United States
crosses the Red River of the North. It didn't <hi rend="italic">extend</hi> there from our
frontier, sure enough. If it extended from anywhere it must have been from
the north, or along the confines of that mystic region called Rainy Lake.
Pembina is said to have about 600 inhabitants. It is situated on the Pembina
River. It is an Indian-French word meaning cranberry. Men live there who
were born there, and it is in fact an old settlement. It was founded by British
subjects, who thought they had located on British soil. The greater part
of its inhabitants are half-breeds, who earn a comfortable livelihood in
fur hunting and in farming. It sends two representatives and a councillor
to the territorial legislature. It is 460 miles north-west of St. Paul, and
330 miles distant from this town. Notwithstanding the distance, there is
considerable communication between the places. West of Pembina, about thirty

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0115" n="104"/>
miles, is a settlement called St. Joseph, situated N. of a large mythological
body of water called Miniwakan, or Devil's Lake; and is one of the points
where Col. Smith's expedition was intending to stop. This expedition to which
I refer, started out from Fort Snelling in the summer, to explore the country
on both sides of the Red River of the North as far as Pembina, and to report
to the war department the best points for the establishment of a new military
post. It is expected that Col. Smith will return by the first of next month;
and it is probable he will advise the erection of a post at Pembina. When
that is done, if it is done, its effect will be to draw emigrants from the
Red River settlement into Minnesota.
</p><p>
Now let me say a word about this Red River of the North,
for it is beginning to be a great feature in this upper country. It runs
north, and empties into Lake Winnipeg, which connects with Hudson's Bay by
Nelson River. It is a muddy and sluggish stream, navigable to the mouth of
Sioux Wood River for vessels of three feet draught for four months in the
year. So that the extent of its navigation within the territory alone (between
Pembina and the mouth of Sioux Wood River) is 417 miles. Buffaloes still
feed on its western banks. Its tributaries are numerous and copious, abounding
with the choicest kinds of game, and skirted with a various and beautiful
foliage. It cannot be many years before this magnificent valley shall pour
its products 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0116" n="105"/>
into our markets, and be the theatre of a busy and genial life.
</p><p>
One of the first things which drew my attention to this
river was a sight of several teams travelling towards this vicinity from
a north-westerly direction. I observed that the complexion of those in the
caravan was a little darker than that of pure white Minnesotians, and that
the carts were a novelty. "Who are those people? and where are they from?"
I inquired of a friend. "They are Red River people, just arrived&mdash;they have
come down to trade." Their carts are made to be drawn by one animal, either
an ox or a horse, and are put together without the use of a particle of iron.
They are excellently adapted to prairie travelling. How strange it seems!
Here are people who have been from twenty to thirty days on their journey
to the nearest civilized community. This is their nearest market. Their average
rate of travelling is about fifteen miles a day, and they generally secure
game enough on the way for their living. I have had highly interesting accounts
of the Red River settlement since I have been here, both from Mr. Ross and
Mr. Marion, gentlemen recently from there. The settlement is seventy miles
north of Pembina, and lies on both sides of the river. Its population is
estimated at 10,000. It owes its origin and growth to the enterprise and
success of the Hudson's Bay Company. Many of the settlers came from Scotland,
but the most were from Canada. They speak English and Canadian French. The

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0117" n="106"/>
English style of society is well kept up, whether we regard the church with
its bishop, the trader with his wine cellar, the scholar with his library,
the officer with his sinecure, or their paper currency. I find they have
everything but a hotel, for I was particular on that point, though not intending
just yet to go there. Probably the arrivals do not justify such an institution,
but their cordial hospitality will make up for any such lack, from all I
hear. They have a judge who gets a good house to live in, and L1000 sterling
a year; but he has nothing of consequence to do. He was formerly a leading
lawyer in Canada.
</p><p>
The great business of the settlement, of course, is the
fur traffic. An immense amount of buffalo skins is taken in the summer and
autumn, while in the winter smaller but more valuable furs are procured.
The Indians also enlist in the hunts; and it is estimated that upwards of
$200,000 worth of furs are annually taken from our territory and sold to
the Hudson's Bay Company. It is high time indeed that a military post should
be established somewhere on the Red River by our government. The Hudson's
Bay Company is now a powerful monopoly. Not so magnificent and potent as
the East India Company, it is still a powerful combination, showering opulence
on its members, and reflecting a peculiar feature in the strength and grandeur
of the British empire&mdash;a power, which, to use the eloquent language of Daniel
Webster, "has dotted 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0118" n="107"/>
over the whole surface of the globe with her possessions
and military posts&mdash;whose morning drum-beat, following the sun, and keeping
company with the hours, circles the earth daily with one continuous and unbroken
strain of martial music." The company is growing richer every year, and its
jurisdiction and its lands will soon find an availability never dreamed of
by its founders, unless, as may possibly happen, popular sovereignty steps
in to grasp the fruits of its long apprenticeship. Some time ago I believe
the Canadas sought to annex this broad expanse to their own jurisdiction.
There are about two hundred members in the Hudson's Bay Company. The charter
gives them the power to legislate for the settlement. They have many persons
in their employ in England as well as in British America. A clerk, after
serving the company ten years, with a salary of about $500 per annum, is
considered qualified for membership, with the right to vote in the deliberations
of the company, and one share in the profits. The profits of a share last
year amounted to $10,000! A factor of the company, after serving ten years,
is entitled to membership with the profits of two shares. The aristocracy
of the settlement consists principally of retired factors and other members
of the company, who possess large fortunes, dine on juicy roast beef, with
old port, ride in their carriages, and enjoy life in a very comfortable manner.
Two of the company's ships sail up into Hudson's Bay every year to bring

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0119" n="108"/>
merchandise to the settlement and take away furs. <ref target="n1.10.1" n="5">1</ref> But the greatest portion
of the trade is done with Minnesota. Farming is carried on in the neighborhood
of the settlement with cheerful ease and grand success. I was as much surprised
to hear of the nature of their agriculture as of anything else concerning
the settlement. The same kind of crops are raised as in Pennsylvania or Maine;
and this in a country, be it remembered, five hundred miles and upwards north
of St. Paul. Stock must be easily raised, as it would appear from the fact
that it is driven down here into the territory and sold at a great profit.
Since I have been here, a drove of fine-looking cattle from that settlement
passed to be sold in the towns below, and a drove of horses is expected this
fall. The stock which comes from there is more hardy than can be got anywhere
else, and therefore is preferred by the Minnesotians.
</p><p>
The following extract from Ex-Governor Ramsey's address,
recently delivered before the annual fair at Minneapolis, wherein he gives
some results of his observations of the Red River settlement during his trip
there in 1851, will be read with much interest:&mdash;
</p><p>
"Re-embarking in our canoes, we continued descending the
river for some fifteen miles further, through the French portion of the
settlement, lining 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0120" n="109"/>
mainly the west or left bank of the river, until we arrived
about the centre of the colony, at the mouth of the Assinniboin tributary
of Red River, where we landed and remained a few days, viewing the colony
and its improvements. I was at that time, and am even now, when I look back
upon it, lost in wonder at the phenomena which that settlement exhibits to
the world, considering its location in an almost polar region of the North.
Imagine a river flowing sluggishly northward through a flat alluvial plain,
and the west side of it lined continuously for over thirty miles with cultivated
farms, each presenting those appearances of thrift around them which I mentioned
as surrounding the first farms seen by us; but each farm with a narrow frontage
on the river of only twenty-four rods in width, but extending back for one
or two miles, and each of these narrow farms having their dwellings and the
farm out-buildings spread only along the river front, with lawns sloping
to the water's edge, and shrubbery and vines liberally trained around them,
and trees intermingled&mdash;the whole presenting the appearance of a long suburban
village&mdash;such as you might see near our eastern sea-board, or such as you
find exhibited in pictures of English country villages, with the resemblance
rendered more striking by the spires of several large churches peeping above
the foliage of the trees in the distance, whitewashed school-houses glistening
here and there amidst sunlight and green; gentlemen's houses of 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0121" n="110"/>
pretentious
dimensions and grassy lawns and elaborate fencing, the seats of retired officers
of the Hudson's Bay Company occasionally interspersed; here an English bishop's
parsonage, with a boarding or high school near by; and over there a Catholic
bishop's massive cathedral, with a convent of Sisters of Charity attached;
whilst the two large stone forts, at which reside the officers of the Hudson's
Bay Company, or of the colony once called Upper Fort Garry, and situated
at the mouth of the Assinniboin, and the other termini the Lower Fort Garry,
which is twenty miles farther down the river, helped to give additional
picturesqueness to the scene. I had almost forgotten to mention what is,
after all, the most prominent and peculiar feature of that singular landscape,
singular from its location&mdash;and that is the numerous wind-mills, nearly twenty
in all, which on every point of land made by the turns and bends in the river,
stretched out their huge sails athwart the horizon, and seemingly looked
defiance at us as invading strangers, that were from a land where steam or
water mills monopolize their avocation of flour making. One morning as we
passed down the principal high road, on our way to Lower Fort Garry, the
wind, after a protracted calm, began to blow a little; when presto! each
mill veered around its sails to catch the propitious breeze, and as the sails
began to revolve, it was curious to observe the numerous carts that shot
out from nearly every farm-house, and hurried 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0122" n="111"/>
along the road to these mills,
to get ground their grists of spring wheat, with which they were respectively
loaded.
</p><p>
"Another incident during the same trip that struck us oddly,
was seeing two ladies driving by themselves a fine horse hitched to a buggy
of modern fashion, just as much at home apparently as if they were driving
through the streets of St. Paul, or St. Anthony, or Minneapolis, instead
of upon that remote highway towards the North Pole; but this was not a whit
more novel than to hear the pianoforte, and played, too, with both taste
and skill. While another 'lion' of those parts that met our view was a topsail
schooner lying in the river at the lower fort, which made occasional trips
into Great Lake Winnepeg of the North, a hundred miles below.
</p><p>
"I took occasion during my visit to inquire what success
the farmers met with in securing good crops, and the profits of farmers
generally. As to wheat, I learned that the yield of the spring variety was
quite equal in quantity and quality to the crop of that grain on any more
southern farms; that in raising barley they could almost surpass the world;
and the cereals generally, and all the esculent roots, were easily raised.
Indian corn was not planted as a field crop, though it was grown in their
gardens. In a word, the capacity of their land to produce almost everything
plentifully and well, was established; but for all this, farming did not
afford much
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0123" n="112"/>
profit. for want of a sufficient market; beyond a small demand
by the Hudson's Bay Company, there was no outlet for their superabundance;
and to use an Austrian phase in regard to Hungarians, the Selkirkers are
metaphysically 'smothering in their own fat.' To remedy this state of things
they were beginning, when I was there, to turn their attention towards raising
cattle and horses, for which their country is well calculated; and the first
fruits of this new decision given to their farming energies, we have already
experienced in the droves of both which have recently been driven from thence
and sold in this vicinity."
</p><p>
I think the facts which I have herein hastily set downhill
dispel any apprehension as to the successful cultivation of the soil in the
northern part of the territory. It has a health-giving climate which before
long, I predict, will nourish as patriotic a race of men as gave immortality
to the noble plains of Helvetia. There is one thing I would mention which
seems to auspicate the speedy development of the valley of the North Red
River. Next year Minnesota will probably be admitted as a state; and a new
territory organized out of the broad region embracing the valley aforesaid
and the head waters of the Mississippi. Or else it will be divided by a line
north and south, including the western valley of that river, and extending
as far to the west as the Missouri River. I understand it will be called
Dacotah, though I at first thought it would be called Pembina. 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0124" n="113"/>
There is always
a rush into new territories, and the proposed new territory of Dacotah will
present sufficient inducements for a large immigration. When the valley of
the North Red River shall be settled, and splendid harvest fields adorn its
banks; when great factories take the place of wind-mills, and when railroads
shall take the place of Red River carts, then we will have new cause to exclaim,

THE TRUE PIONEER.</head>

the farmer in moving West&mdash;Advice in regard to making preemption claims&mdash;Abstract
of the preemption law&mdash;Hints to the settler&mdash;Character and services of the

<opener><dateline><name type="place">CROW WING, </name><date value="1856-10">October, 1856.</date></dateline></opener>
<p>
I DESIRE in this letter to say something about the pioneer,
and life on the frontier. And by pioneer I mean the true pioneer who comes
into the West to labor and to share the vicissitudes of new settlements;
not the adventurer, who would repine at toil, and gather where he has not
sown.
</p><p>
As I have looked abroad upon the vast domain of the West
beyond the dim Missouri, or in the immediate valley of the Mississippi, I
have wondered at the contrast presented between the comparatively small number
who penetrate to the frontier, and that great throng of men who toil hard
for a temporary livelihood in the populous towns and cities of the Union.
And I have thought if this latter class were at all mindful of the opportunities
for gain and independence which the new territories afforded, they would
soon abandon&mdash;in a great measure at least&mdash;their crowded alleys in the city,
and aspire to be cultivators and owners of the soil. Why 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0126" n="115"/>
there has not been
a greater emigration from cities I cannot imagine, unless it is owing to
a misapprehension of Western life. Either it is this, or the pioneer is possessed
of a very superior degree of energy.
</p><p>
It has been said that the frontier man always keeps on
the frontier; that he continues to emigrate as fast as the country around
him becomes settled. There is a class that do so. Not, however, for the cause
which has been sometimes humorously assigned&mdash;that civilization was inconvenient
to them&mdash;but because good opportunities arise to dispose of the farms they
have already improved; and because a further emigration secures them cheaper
lands. The story of the pioneer who was disturbed by society, when his nearest
neighbor lived fifteen miles off, even if it be true, fails to give the correct
reason for the migratory life of this class of men.
</p><p>
It almost always happens that wherever we go somebody else
has preceded us. Accident or enterprise has led some one to surpass us. Many
of the most useful pioneers of this country have been attracted hither by
the accounts given of its advantages by some one of their friends who had
previously located himself here. Ask a man why he comes, and he says a neighbor
of his, or a son, or a brother, has been in the territory for so many months,
and he likes it so well I concluded to come also. A very respectable gentleman
from Maine, a shipowner and a man of wealth, who came up on 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0127" n="116"/>
the boat with
me to St. Paul, said his son-in-law was in the territory, and he had another
son at home who was bound to come, and if his wife was willing he believed
the whole family would come. Indeed the excellent state of society in the
territory is to be attributed very much to the fact that parents have followed
after their children.
</p><p>
It is pretty obvious too why men will leave poor farms
in New England, and good farms in Ohio, to try their fortunes here. The farmer
in New England, it may be in New Hampshire, hears that the soil of Minnesota
is rich and free from rocks, that there are other favorable resources, and
a salubrious climate such as he has been accustomed to. He concludes that
it is best to sell out the place he has, and try ploughing where there are
no rocks to obstruct him. The farmer of Ohio does not expect to find better
soil than he leaves; but his inducements are that he can sell his land at
forty or fifty dollars an acre, and preempt as good in Minnesota for a dollar
and a quarter an acre. This operation leaves him a surplus fund, and he becomes
a more opulent man, with better means to adorn his farm and to educate his
children.
</p><p>
Those who contemplate coming West to engage in agricultural
employment should leave their families, if families they have, behind till
they have selected a location and erected some kind of a habitation; provided,
however, they have no particular friend whose hospitality they can avail
themselves of till 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0128" n="117"/>
their preliminary arrangements are effected. It will require
three months, I judge, for a man to select a good claim (a quarter section,
being 160 acres), and fence and plough a part of it and to erect thereon
a cabin. There is never a want of land to preempt in a new country. The settler
can always get an original claim, or buy out the claim of another very cheap,
near some other settlers. The liberal policy of our government in regard
to the disposal of public lands is peculiarly beneficial to the settler.
The latter has the first chance. He can go on to a quarter section which
may be worth fifteen dollars an acre, and preempt it before it is surveyed,
and finally obtain it for $1.25 an acre. Whereas the speculator must wait
till the land is surveyed and advertised for sale; and then he can get only
what has not been preempted, and at a price which it brings at auction, not
less than $1.25 an acre. Then what land is not sold at public sale is open
to private entry at $1.25 an acre. It is such land that bounty warrants are
located on. Thus it is seen the pioneer has the first choice. Why, I have
walked over land up here that would now bring from ten to twenty dollars
an acre if it was in the market, and which any settler can preempt and get
for $1.25 an acre. I am strongly tempted to turn farmer myself, and go out
and build me a cabin. The speculation would be a good one. But to acquire
a title by preemption I must dwell on the soil, and prove that I have erected
a dwelling and made other 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0129" n="118"/>
improvements. In other words, before a man (or
any head of a family) can get a patent, he must satisfy the land officers
that he is a dweller in good faith on the soil. It is often the case, indeed,
that men get a title by preemption who never intend to live on their quarter
section. But they do it by fraud. They have a sort of mental reservation,
I suppose, when they take the requisite oaths. In this way many valuable
claims are taken up and held along from month to month, or from year to year,
by mock improvements. A pretender will make just improvements enough to hinder
the actual settler from locating on the claim, or will sell out to him at
a good profit. A good deal of money is made by these fictitious claimants.
It is rather hard to prevent it, too, inasmuch as it is difficult to disprove
that a man intends some time to have a permanent home, or, in fact, that
his claim is not his legal residence, though his usual abiding place is somewhere
else. Nothing could be more delightful than for a party of young men who
desire to farm to come out together early in the spring, and aid each other
in preempting land in the same neighborhood. The preemptor has to pay about
five dollars in the way of fees before he gets through the entire process
of securing a title. It is a popular error (much like the opinion that a
man cannot swear to what he sees through glass) that improvements of a certain
value, say fifty dollars, are required to be made, or that a certain number
of acres 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0130" n="119"/>
must be cultivated. All that is required, however, is evidence that
the party has built a house fit to live in, and has in good faith proceeded
to cultivate the soil. The law does not permit a person to preempt 160 acres
but once; yet this provision is often disregarded, possibly from ignorance,
I was about to say, but that cannot be, since the applicant must make oath
that he has not before availed himself of the right of preemption.
</p><p>
I will insert at this place an abridgment of the preemption
act of 4th September, 1841, which I made two years ago; and which was extensively
published in the new states and territories. I am happy to find, also, that
it has been thought worth copying into one or more works on the West.
</p><p>
I. <hi rend="italic">Lands subject to preemption.</hi> By sec. 10 of said
act it is provided that the public lands to which the Indian title had been
extinguished at the time of the settlement, and which had also been <hi rend="italic">surveyed
</hi>prior thereto, shall be subject to preemption, and purchase at the rate
of one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre. And by the act of 22d July,
1854, sec. 12, the preemption of <hi rend="italic">unsurveyed</hi> lands is recognised as
legal. Lands of the following description are excepted: such as are included
in any reservation, by any treaty, law, or proclamation of the President
of the United States, or reserved for salines or for other purposes; lands
included within the limits of any incorporated town, or which have been selected
as the site for a city or town; lands actually 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0131" n="120"/>
settled and occupied for the
purposes of trade and not agriculture; and lands on which are situated any
known salines or mines.
</p><p>
II. <hi rend="italic">The amount</hi> designated is any number of acres
not exceeding one hundred and sixty.
</p><p>
III. <hi rend="italic">Who may preempt. "</hi>Every person being the head
of a family, or widow, or single man over the age of twenty-one years, and
being a citizen of the United States, or having filed his declaration of
intention to become a citizen, as required by the naturalization laws." But
no person shall be entitled to more than one preemptive right, and no person
who is the proprietor of three hundred and twenty acres of land in any state
or territory of the United States, and no person who shall quit or abandon
his residence on his own land to reside on the public land in the same state
or territory, shall acquire any right of preemption.
</p><p>
IV. <hi rend="italic">The method to perfect the right.</hi> The preemptor
must make a settlement on the land in person; inhabit and improve the same,
and erect thereon a dwelling. And when the land has been surveyed previous
to settlement the preemptor shall, within thirty days of the date of the
settlement, file with the register of the proper district a written statement
describing the land settled upon, and declaring the intention of such person
to claim the same under the provisions of the preemption law. And within
twelve months of the date of the settlement such person shall make the requisite
proof, affidavit, and payment. 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0132" n="121"/>
When unsurveyed lands are prompted (act of
1854), notice of the specific tracts claimed shall be filed with the surveyor
general, within three months after the survey has been made in the field.
And when two or more persons shall have settled on the same quarter section,
the right of preemption shall be in him or her who made the first settlement;
and questions arising between different settlers shall be decided by the
register and receiver of the district within which the land is situated,
subject to an appeal to and revision by the Secretary of the Interior of
the United States.
</p><p>
And the settler must make oath before the receiver or register
that he or she has never had the benefit of any right of preemption under
the preemption act: that he or she is not the owner of three hundred and
twenty acres of land in any state or territory of the United States, nor
hath he or she settled upon and improved said land to sell the same on
speculation, but in good faith to appropriate it to his or her own exclusive
use or benefit: and that he or she has not directly or indirectly made any
agreement or contract in any way or manner with any person or persons whatsoever,
by which the title which he or she might acquire from the government of the
United States should enure in whole or in part to the benefit of any person
except himself or herself; and if any person talking such oath shall swear
falsely in the premises, he or she shall be subject to all the pains and
penalties 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0133" n="122"/>
of perjury, and shall forfeit the money which he or she may have
paid for such land, and all right and title to the same; and any grant or
conveyance which he or she may have made, except in the hands of bona fide
purchasers for a valuable consideration, shall be null and void.
</p><p>
Proof of the requisite settlement and improvement shall
be made by the preemptor to the satisfaction of the register and receiver,
in the district in which the lands so claimed lie, who shall each be entitled
to receive fifty cents from each applicant for his services rendered. as
aforesaid; and all assignments and transfers of the right hereby secured
prior to the issuing of the patent, shall be null and void. (See U. S. Stat.
at Large, vol. 5, 453-458.)
</p><p>
But I was on the point of advising the settler what he
should bring with him into a new country and what leave behind. He should
not bring much furniture. It is very expensive and troublesome to have it
transported. Nor will he need much to begin with, or have room for it. It
will cost nearly as much to transport it seventy miles through the territory
as it will to bring it from whence he started within the limits of the territory.
Let him pack up in a small compass the most precious part of his inanimate
household, and leave it ready for an agent to start it after he shall have
found a domicil. This will save expensive storage. Then let his goods be
directed to the care of some responsible forwarding merchant in a river town

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0134" n="123"/>
nearest to their final destination, that they may be taken care of and not
be left exposed on the levee when they arrive. St. Paul is now a place of
so much mercantile importance and competition that one may buy provisions,
furniture, or agricultural tools cheaper there than he can himself bring
them from the East. The professional man, however, will do well to bring
his books with him.
</p><p>
Let us assume now that the settler has got his house up,
either a frame house or of logs, with a part of his farm fenced; and that
be has filed his application for preemption at the land office in the district
in which he resides. Let us suppose further, that he is passing his first
autumn here. His house, if he is a man of limited means, has but two rooms,
and they are both on the basement story. He has just shelter enough for his
stock, but none for his hay, which is stacked near by. The probability is,
that he lives in the vicinity of some clear stream or copious spring, and
has not, therefore, needed to dig a well. The whole establishment, one would
think, who was accustomed to the Eastern style of living, betrayed downright
poverty.
</p><p>
But let us stop a moment; this is the home of a pioneer.
He has been industrious, and everything about him exhibits forethought. There
is a cornfield all fenced in with tamarack poles. It is paved over with pumpkins
(for pumpkins flourish wonderfully in Minnesota), and contains twenty acres
of ripe corn, which, allowing thirty-five bushels to an 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0135" n="124"/>
acre, is worth at
ninety cents per bushel the sum of $630. There are three acres of potatoes,
of the very best quality, containing three hundred bushels, which, at fifty
cents a bushel, are worth $150. Here then, off of two crops, he gets $780,
and I make a moderate estimate at that. Next year he will add to this a crop
of oats or wheat. The true pioneer is a model farmer. He lays out his work
two weeks in advance. Every evening finds him further ahead. If there is
a rainy day, he knows what to set himself about. Be lays his plans in a
systematic manner, and carries them into execution with energy. He is a true
pioneer, and therefore he is not an idle man, nor a loafer, nor a weak
addle-headed tippler. Go into his house, and though you do not see elegance
you can yet behold intelligence, and neatness, and sweet domestic bliss.
The life of the pioneer is not exposed to such hardships and delays as retarded
the fortunes of the settlers in the older states. They had to clear forests;
here the land is ready for the plough. And though "there is society where
none intrude," yet he is not by any means beyond the boundaries of good
neighborhood. In many cases, however, he has left his dearest friends far
away in his native village, where his affections still linger. He has to
endure painful separations, and to forego those many comforts which spring
from frequent meetings under the parental roof, and frequent converse with
the most attractive scones of youth. But to compensate
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0136" n="125"/>
for these things he
can feel that the labor of the pioneer, aside from its pecuniary advantage
to himself, is of service to the state, and a helpmate to succeeding generations.

<p>
IT is maintained by the reviewers, I believe, that the
duller a writer is, the more accurate he should be. In the outset of this
letter, I desire to testify my acquiescence in the justice of that dogma,
for if, like neighbor Dogberry, "I were as tedious as a king," I could not
find it in my heart to bestow it all without a measure of utility.
</p><p>
I shall try to answer some questions which I imagine might
be put by different classes of men who are interested in this part of the
west. My last letter had some hints to the farmer, and I can only add, in
addition, for his benefit, that the most available locations are now a
considerable distance above St. Paul. The valley of the St. Peter's is pretty
much taken up; and so of the valley of the Mississippi for a distance of
fifteen miles on either side to a point a hundred miles above St. Paul. One
of 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0138" n="127"/>
the land officers at Minneapolis informed me that there were good preemption
claims to be had fifteen miles west, that being as far as the country was
thickly settled. One of the finest regions now unoccupied, that I know of,
not to except even the country on the Crow Wing River, is the land bordering
on Otter Tail Lake. For forty miles all round that lake the land is splendid.
More than a dozen disinterested eye-witnesses have described that region
to me in the most glowing terms. In beauty, in fertility, and in the various
collateral resources which make a farming country desirable, it is not surpassed.
It lies south of the picturesque highlands or <hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="fre">hauteurs des terres,</foreign></hi>
and about midway between the sources of the Crow Wing and North Red Rivers.
From this town the distance to it is sixty miles. The lake itself is forty
miles long and five miles in width. The water is clear and deep, and abounds
with white fish that are famous for their delicious flavor. The following
description, which I take from Captain Pope's official narrative of his
exploration, is a reliable description of this delightful spot, now fortunately
on the eve of being settled&mdash;" To the west, north-west, and north-east, the
whole country is heavily timbered with oak, elm, ash, maple, birch, bass,
&amp;c., &amp;c. Of these the sugar maple is probably the most valuable,
and in the vicinity of Otter Tail Lake large quantities of maple sugar are
manufactured by the Indians. The wild rice, which exists in these lakes in
the most 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0139" n="128"/>
lavish profusion, constitutes a most necessary article of food with
the Indians, and is gathered in large quantities in the months of September
and October. To the east the banks of the lake are fringed with heavy oak
and elm timber to the width of one mile. The whole region of country for
fifty miles in all directions around this lake is among the most beautiful
and fertile in the world. The fine scenery of lakes and open groves of oak
timber, of winding streams connecting them, and beautifully rolling country
on all sides, renders this portion of Minnesota the garden spot of the
north-west. It is impossible in a report of this character to describe the
feeling of admiration and astonishment with which we first beheld the charming
country in the vicinity of this lake; and were I to give expression to my
own feelings and opinions in reference to it, I fear they would be considered
the ravings of a visionary or an enthusiast."<ref target="n1.12.1" n="6">1</ref> But let me say to the speculator
that he need not covet any of these broad acres. There is little chance for
him. Before that land can be bought at public sale or by mere purchasers
at private sale, it will, I feel sure, be entirely occupied by actual settlers.
And so it ought to be. The good of the territory is promoted by that 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0140" n="129"/>
beneficent
policy of our public land laws which gives the actual settler the first and
best chance to acquire a title by preemption.
</p><p>
Speculators have located a great many land warrants in
Minnesota. Some have been located on lakes, some on swamps, some on excellent
land. Of course the owner, who, as a general thing, is a nonresident, leaves
his land idle for something to "turn up" to make it profitable. There it
stands doing no good, but on the contrary is an encumbrance to the settler,
who has to travel over and beyond it without meeting the face of a neighbor
in its vicinity. The policy of new states is to tax non-resident landholders
at a high rate. When the territory becomes a state, and is obliged to raise
a revenue, some of these fellows outside, who, to use a phrase common up
here, have plastered the country over with land warrants, will have to keep
a lookout for the tax-gatherer. Now I do not mean to discourage moneyed men
from investing in Minnesota lands. I do not wish to raise any bugbears, but
simply to let them know that hoarding up large tracts of land without making
improvements, and leaving it to increase in value by the toil and energy
of the pioneer, is a way of doing things which is not popular with the actual
settler. But there is a great deal of money to be made by judicious investments
in land. Buying large tracts of land I believe to be the least profitable
speculation, unless indeed the purchaser knows exactly what he 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0141" n="130"/>
is buying,
and is on hand at the public sale to get the benefit of a second choice.
I say second choice, because the preemptor has had the first choice long
ago, and it may be before the land was surveyed. What I would recommend to
speculators is to purchase in some good town sites. Buy in two or three,
and if one or two happen to prove failures, the profits on the other will
enable you to bear the loss. I know of a man who invested $6000 at St. Paul
six years ago. He has sold over $80,000 worth of the land, and has as much
more left. This is but an ordinary instance. The advantage of buying lots
in a town arises from the rapid rise of the value of the land, the ready
market, and withal the moderate prices at which they can be procured during
the early part of its history.
</p><p>
To such persons as have a desire to come West, and are
not inclined to be farmers, and who have not capital enough to engage in
mercantile business, there is sufficient employment. A new country always
opens avenues of successful business for every industrious man and woman;
more kinds even than I could well enumerate. Every branch of mechanics needs
workmen of all grades; from the boy who planes the rough boards to the head
workman. Teaming affords good employment for young men the year round. The
same may be said of the saw-mills. A great deal of building is going on
constantly; and those who have good trades get $2.50 per day. I am speaking,
of course, of the 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0142" n="131"/>
territory in general. One of the most profitable kinds
of miscellaneous business is surveying. This art requires the services of
large numbers; not only to survey the public lands, but town sites and the
lands of private individuals. Labor is very high everywhere in the West,
whether done by men, women, or children;&mdash;even the boys, not fourteen years
old, who clean the knives and forks on the steamboats, get $20 a month and
<hi rend="italic">are found</hi>. But the best of it all is, that when a man earns a few
dollars he can easily invest it in a piece of land, and double his money
in three months, perhaps in one month. One of the merchant princes of Boston,
the late Col. T. H. Perkins, published a notice in a Boston paper in 1789,
he being then 25, that he would soon embark on board the ship Astrea for
Canton, and that if any one desired to commit an "adventure" to him, they
might be assured of his exertions for their interests. The practice of sending
" adventures" "beyond the seas" is not so common as it was once; and instead
thereof men invest their funds in western prizes. But let me remark in regard
to the fact I relate, that it shows the true pioneer spirit. Col. Perkins
was a pioneer. His energy led him beyond his counting-room, and he reaped
the reward of his exertions in a great fortune.
</p><p>
I have now a young man in my mind who came to a town ten
miles this side of St. Paul, six months ago, with $500. He commenced trading,
and has 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0143" n="132"/>
already, by good investments and the profits of his business, doubled
his money. Everything that one can eat or wear brings a high price, or as
high as it does in any part of the West. The number of visitors and emigrants
is so large that the productions of the territory are utterly inadequate
to supply the market. Therefore large quantities of provisions have to be
brought up the river from the lower towns. At Swan River, 100 miles this
side of St. Paul, pork is worth $85. Knowing that pork constitutes a great
part of the "victuals" up this way, though far from being partial to the
article, I tried it when I dined at Swan River to see if it was good, and
found it to be very excellent. Board for laboring men must be about four
dollars a week. For transient guests at Crow Wing it is one dollar a day.
</p><p>
I have heard it said that money is scarce. It is possible.
It certainly commands a high premium; but the reason is that there are such
splendid opportunities to make fortunes by building and buying and selling
city lots. A man intends that the rent of a house or store shall pay for
its construction in three years. The profits of adventure justify a man in
paying high interest. If a man has money enough to buy a pair of horses and
a wagon, he can defy the world. These are illustrations to show why one is
induced to pay interest. I do not think, however, money is "tight." I never
saw 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0144" n="133"/>
people so free with their money, or appear to have it in so great abundance.
</p><p>
There is one drawback which this territory has in common
with the greater part of the West, and in fact of the civilized world. It
is not only a drawback, but a nuisance anywhere; I mean drinking or whiskey
shops. The greater proportion of the settlers are temperate men, I am sure;
but in almost every village there are places where the meanest kind of
intoxicating liquor is sold. There are some who sell liquor to the Indians.
But such business is universally considered as the most degraded that a mean
man can be guilty of. It is filthy to see men staggering about under the
influence of bad whiskey, or of any kind of whiskey. He who sends a young
husband to his new cabin home intoxicated, to mortify and torment his family;
or who sells liquor to the uneducated Indians, that they may fight and murder,
must have his conscience&mdash;if he has any at all&mdash;cased over with sole leather.
Mr. Gough is needed in the West.
</p><p>
Minnesota is not behind in education. Ever since Governor
Slade, of Vermont, brought some bright young school mistresses up to St.
Paul (in 1849), common school education has been diffusing its precious
influences. The government wisely sets apart two sections of land&mdash;the 16th
and 36th&mdash;in every township for school purposes. A township is six miles
square; and the two sections thus reserved in
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0145" n="134"/>
each township comprise 1280
acres. Other territories have the same provision. This affords a very good
fund for educational uses, or rather it is a great aid to the exertions of
the people. There are some nourishing institutions of learning in the territory.
But the greatest institution after all in the country&mdash;the surest protection
of our liberties and our laws&mdash;is the FREE SCHOOL.
</p>
<note id="n1.12.1" n="6"><seg type="note-symbol">1</seg> <p>To illustrate the rapid progress which is going on constantly,
I would remark that in less than a month after leaving Crow Wing, I received
a letter from there informing me that Messrs. Crittenden, Cathcart, and others
had been to Otter Tail Lake and laid out a town which they call Otter Tail
City. The standing and means of the men engaged in the enterprise, are a
sure guaranty of its success.</p></note>

<p>
YESTERDAY morning at seven I took my departure, on the
stage, from Crow Wing. It was a most delightful morning, the air not damp,
but bracing; and the welcome rays of the sun shed a mellow lustre upon a
scene of "sylvan beauty." The first hour's ride was over a road I had passed
in the dark on my upward journey, and this was the first view I had of the
country immediately below Crow Wing. No settlements were to be seen, because
the regulations of military reservations preclude their being made except
for some purpose connected with the public interests. A heavy shower the
night before had effectually laid the dust, and we bounded along on the easy
coach in high spirits. The view of the prairie stretching "in airy undulations
far away," and of the eddying current of the Mississippi, there as everywhere
deep and majestic, with its banks skirted with autumn-colored foliage, was
enough to commend the old fashioned system of stages to more general use.
Call it poetry or what 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0147" n="136"/>
you please, yet the man who can contemplate with
indifference the wonderful profusion of nature, undeveloped by art&mdash;inviting,
yet never touched by the plough&mdash;must lack some one of the senses. Indeed,
this picture, so characteristic of the new lands of the West, seems to call
into existence a new sense. The view takes in a broad expanse which has never
produced a stock of grain; and which has been traversed for ages past by
a race whose greatest and most frequent calamity was hunger. If we turn to
its past there is no object to call back our thoughts. All is oblivion. There
are no ruins to awaken curious images of former life&mdash;no vestige of
humanity&mdash;nothing but the present generation of nature. And yet there are
traces of the past generations of nature to be seen. The depressions of the
soil here and there to be observed, covered with a thick meadow grass, are
unmistakeable indications of lakes which have now "vanished into thin air."
That these gentle hollows were once filled with water is the more certain
from the appearance of the shores of the present lakes, where the low water
mark seems to have grown lower and lower every year. But if the past is blank,
these scenes are suggestive of happy reflections as to the future. The long
perspective is radiant with busy life and cheerful husbandry. New forms spring
into being. Villages and towns spring up as if by magic, along whose streets
throngs of men are passing. And thus, as "coming events cast their 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0148" n="137"/>
shadows before," does the mind wander from the real to the probable. An hour and
a half of this sort of revery, and we had come to the Fort Ripley ferry,
over which we were to go for the mail. That ferry (and I have seen others
on the river like it) is a marvellous invention. It is a flat-boat which
is quickly propelled either way across the river by means of the resistance
which it offers to the current. Its machinery is so simple I will try to
describe it. In the first place a rope is stretched across the river from
elevated objects on either side. Each end of the boat is made fast to this
line by pullies, which can be taken up or let out at the fastenings on the
boat. All that is required to start the boat is to bring the bow, by means
of the pully, to an acute angle with the current. The after part of the boat
presents the principal resistance to the current by sliding a thick board
into the water from the upper side. As the water strikes against this, the
boat is constantly attempting to describe a circle, which it is of course
prevented from doing by the current, and so keeps on&mdash;for it must move
somewhere&mdash;in a direction where the obstruction is less. It certainly belongs
to the science of hydraulics, for it is not such a boat as can be propelled
by steam or wind. I had occasion recently to cross the Mississippi on a similar
ferry, early in the morning, and before the ferryman was up. The proprietor
of it was with me; yet neither of us knew much of its practical operation.
I soon pulled 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0149" n="138"/>
the head of the boat towards the current, but left down the
resistance board, or whatever it is called, at the bow as well as at the
stern. This, of course, impeded our progress; but we got over in a few minutes;
and I felt so much interested in this new kind of navigation, that I would
have been glad to try the voyage over again.
</p><p>
On arriving within the square of the garrison, I expected
to find the mail ready for delivery to the driver; but we had to wait half
an hour. The mail is only weekly, and there was nothing of any consequence
to change. We repaired to the post office, which was in a remote corner of
a store-room, where the postmaster was busy making up his mail. Some of the
officers had come in with documents which they wished to have mailed. And
while we stood waiting, corporals and privates, servants of other officers
brought in letters which Lieutenant So-and-so "was particularly desirous
of having mailed this morning." The driver was magnanimous enough to submit
to me whether we should wait. We all felt accommodating&mdash;the postmaster I
saw was particularly so&mdash;and we concluded to wait till everything was in,
and perhaps we would have waited for some one to write a letter. I could
not but think it would be a week before another mail day; and still I could
not but think these unnecessary morning hindrances were throwing a part of
our journey into the night hours. Returning again to the eastern bank of
the river by our fine ferry, 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0150" n="139"/>
we soon passed the spacious residence of Mr.
Olmsted, a prominent citizen of the territory. We made a formal halt at his
door to see if there were any passengers. Mr. Olmsted has a large farm under
good cultivation, and several intelligent young men in his service. In that
neighborhood are some other as handsome farms as I ever saw; but I think
they are on the reservation, and are cultivated under the patronage of the
war department. The winter grain was just up, and its fresh verdure afforded
an agreeable contrast with the many emblems of decaying nature. It was in
the middle of the forenoon that we reached Belle Prairie, along which are
many good farm houses occupied by half-breeds. There is a church and a
school-house. In the cemetery is a large cross painted black and white, and
from its imposing appearance it cannot fail to make a solemn impression on
minds which revere any tangible object that is consigned sacred. A very
comfortable-looking house was pointed out to me as the residence of a Catholic
priest, who has lived for many years in that section, spreading among the
ignorant a knowledge of Christianity, and ministering to their wants in the
hour of death. And though I am no Catholic, I could not but regard the
superiority of that kind of preaching&mdash;for visiting the sick, consoling the
afflicted, and rebuking sin by daily admonitions, is the true preaching of
the Gospel&mdash;over the pompous declamation which now too often usurps the pulpit.
</p><p>
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0151" n="140"/>
The dinner was smoking hot on the table when we drove up
to the hotel at Swan River; and so charming a drive in the pure air had given
me a keen appetite. The dinner (and I speak of these matters because they
are quite important to travellers) was in all respects worthy of the appetite.
The great staple article of Minnesota soil appears to be potatoes, for they
were never known to be better anywhere else&mdash;Eastport not excepted&mdash;and at
our table d'hote they were a grand collateral to the beef and pork. The dessert
consisted of nice home made apple pies served with generosity, and we had
tea or milk or water, as requested, for a beverage. After partaking of a
dinner of this kind, the rest of the day's journey was looked forward to
with no unpleasant emotions. The stage happened to be lightly loaded, and
we rolled along with steady pace, and amidst jovial talk, till we reached
the thriving, but to me not attractive, town of Watab. Three houses had been
put up within the short time since I had stopped there. We got into Mr. Gilman's
tavern at sundown. I was rejoiced to find a horse and carriage waiting for
me, which had been kindly sent by a friend to bring me to St. Cloud. It is
seven miles from Watab to this town. It was a charming moonlight evening,
and I immediately started on with the faithful youth who had charge of the
carriage, to enjoy my supper and lodging under the roof of my hospitable
friend at St. Cloud.

<p>
IF I follow the injunction of that most impartial and worthy
critic, Lord Jeffrey, which is, that tourists should describe those things
which make the pleasantest impression on their own minds, I should begin
with an account of the delightful entertainment which genuine hospitality
and courtesy have here favored me with. I passed Blannerhasset's Island once,
and from a view of the scenery, sought something of that inspiration which,
from reading Wirt's glowing description of it, I thought would be excited;
but the reality was far below my anticipation. If applied to the banks of
the Mississippi River, however, at this place, where the Sauk Rapids terminate,
that charming description would be no more than an adequate picture. The
residence of my friend is a little above the limits of St. Cloud, midway
on the gradual rise from the river to the prairie. It is a neat white two-story
cottage, 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0153" n="142"/>
with a piazza in front. The yard extends to the water's edge, and
in it is a grove of handsome shade trees. Now that the leaves have fallen,
we can sit on the piazza and have a full view of the river through the branches
of the trees. The river is here very clear and swift, with a hard bottom;
and if it were unadorned with its cheerful foliage-covered banks, the view
of it would still add a charm to a residence. There is a mild tranquillity,
blended with the romance of the scene, admirably calculated to raise in the
mind emotions the most agreeable and serene. For nature is a great instructor
and purifier. As Talfourd says in that charming little volume of Vacation
Rambles, "to commune with nature and grow familiar with all her aspects,
surely softens the manners as much, at the least, as the study of the liberal
arts."
</p><p>
St. Cloud is favorably located on the west bank of the
river, seventy-five miles above St. Paul. It is just enough elevated to have
good drainage facilities, should it become densely populous. For many years
it was the seat of a trading post among the Winnebagoes. But the date of
its start as a town is not more than six months ago; since when it has been
advancing with unsurpassed thrift, on a scale of affluence and durability.
Its main street is surely a street in other respects than in the name; for
it has on either side several neatly built three-story blocks of stores,
around which the gathering of teams and of people denotes such an activity
of 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0154" n="143"/>
business as to dispel any idea that the place is got up under false pretences.
The St. Cloud advertisements in the St. Paul daily papers contain the cards
of about forty different firms or individuals, which is a sort of index to
the business of the place. A printing press is already in the town, and a
paper will in a few days be issued. There are now two hotels; one of which
(the Stearns House), it is said, cost $9000. A flourishing saw-mill was destroyed
by fire, and in a few weeks another one was built in its place. An Episcopal
church is being erected. The steamer "H. M. Rice" runs between here and St.
Anthony. It is sometimes said that this is the head of the Upper Mississippi
navigation, but such is not the case. The Sauk Rapids which terminate here
are an obstruction to continuous navigation between St. Anthony and Crow
Wing, but after you get to the latter place (where the river is twenty feet
deep) there is good navigation for two hundred miles. There are several roads
laid out to intersect at St. Cloud, for the construction of which, I believe,
the government has made some appropriation. Town lots are sold on reasonable
terms to those who intend to make improvements on them, which is the true
policy for any town, but the general market price ranges from $100 to $1000
a lot. The town is not in the hands of capitalists, though moneyed men are
interested in it. General Lowry is a large proprietor. He lives at Arcadia,
just above the town limits, and has a farm consisting of three hundred 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0155" n="144"/>
acres
of the most splendid land, which is well stocked with cattle and durably
fenced. A better barn, or a neater farmyard than he has, cannot be found
between Boston and Worcester. And while speaking of barns I would observe
that the old New England custom of having good barns is better observed in
Minnesota than anywhere else in the West. General Lowry has been engaged
in mercantile business. He was formerly a member of the territorial council,
and is a very useful and valuable citizen of the territory.
</p><p>
It would not be more surprising to have Eastern people
doubt some of the statements concerning the growth of Western towns, than
it was for the king of Siam to doubt that there was any part of the world
where water changed from liquid to a hard substance. His majesty knew nothing
about ice. Now, there are a good many handsome villages in the East which
hardly support one store. Not that people in such a village do not consume
as much or live in finer style; but the reason is that they are old settlers
who produce very much that they live on, and who, by great travelling facilities,
are able to scatter their trading custom into some commercial metropolis.
Suppose, however, one of your large villages to be so newly settled that
the people have had no chance to raise anything from their gardens or their
fields, and are obliged to buy all they are to eat and all that is to furnish
their dwellings, or equip their shops, or stock  their farms; 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0156" n="145"/>
then you have
a state of things which will support several stores, and a whole catalogue
of trades. It is a state of affairs which corresponds with every new settlement
in the West; or, indeed, which faintly compares with the demand for everything
merchantable, peculiar in such places. Then again, besides the actual residents
in a new place, who have money enough in their pockets, but nothing in their
cellars, there is generally a large population in the back country of farmers
and no stores. Such people come to a place like this to trade, for fifteen
or twenty miles back, perhaps; and it being a county seat they have other
objects to bring them. At the same time there is an almost constant flow
of settlers through the place into the unoccupied country to find preemption
claims, who, of course, wish to take supplies with them. The settler takes
a day, perhaps, for his visit in town to trade. Time is precious with him,
and he cannot come often. So he buys, perhaps, fifty or a hundred dollars
worth of goods. These are circumstances which account for activity of business
in these river towns, and which, though they are strikingly apparent here,
are not peculiar to this town. At first, I confess, it was a mystery to me
what could produce such startling and profitable trade in these new towns.
</p><p>
It was in the immediate vicinity of St. Cloud that Gov.
Stevens left the Mississippi on his exploration, in 1853, of a railroad route
to the Pacific. Several crossings of the river had been previously 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0157" n="146"/>
examined,
and it was found that one of the favorable points for a railroad bridge over
it was here. I might here say that the country directly west lies in the
valley of Sauk River, and from my own observation I know it to be a good
farming country; and I believe the land is taken up by settlers as far back
as twelve miles. It is a little upwards of a hundred miles in a westerly
direction from St. Cloud to where the expedition first touched the Bois des
Sioux (or Sioux Wood River). Gov. Stevens says in his report&mdash;" The plateau
of the Bois des Sioux will be a great centre of population and communication.
It connects with the valley of the Red River of the North, navigable 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0158" n="147"/>
four
hundred miles for steamers of three or four feet draught, with forty-five
thousand square miles of arable and timber land; and with the valley of the
Minnesota, also navigable at all seasons when not obstructed by ice, one
hundred miles for steamers, and occasionally a hundred miles further. The
head of navigation of the Red River of the North is within one hundred and
ten miles of the navigable portion of the Mississippi, and is distant only
forty miles from the Minnesota. Eastward from these valleys to the great
lakes, the country on both sides of the Mississippi is rich, and much of
it heavily timbered."
</p><p>
I will also add another remark which he makes, inasmuch
as the character of the country in this latitude, as far as the Pacific shore,
must have great influence on this locality; and it is this: " Probably four
thousand square miles of tillable land is to be found immediately on the
eastern slopes of (the Rocky Mountains); and at the bottoms of the different
streams, retaining their fertility for some distance after leaving the mountains,
will considerably increase this amount." Mr. John Lambert, the topographer
of the exploration, divides the country between the Mississippi and Columbia
rivers, into three grand divisions. The first includes the vast prairies
between the Mississippi and the base of the Rocky Mountains. The second is
the mountain division, embracing about five degrees of longitude. The third
division comprises the immense plains of the Columbia.
</p><p>
Of the first division&mdash;from here to the foot of the Rocky
Mountains&mdash;let me quote what Mr. Lambert in his official report calls a "passing
glance." "Undulating and level prairies, skirted with woods of various growth,
and clothed everywhere with a rich verdure; frequent and rapid streams, with
innumerable small but limpid lakes, frequented by multitudes of waterfowl,
most conspicuous among which appears the stately swan; these, in ever-recurring
succession, make up the panorama of this extensive district, which may be
said to be everywhere fertile, beautiful, and inviting. The most remarkable
features of this region are the intervals of level prairie, especially that
near the bend of Red River, where the horizon is as unbroken as that of a
calm sea. Nor are other points of resemblance 

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0159" n="148"/>
wanting&mdash;the long grass, which
in such places is unusually rank, bending gracefully to the passing breeze
as it sweeps along the plain, gives the idea of waves (as indeed they are);
and the solitary horseman on the horizon is so indistinctly seen as to complete
the picture by the suggestion of a sail, raising the first feeling of novelty
to a character of wonder and delight. The following outlines of the rolling
prairies are broken only by the small lakes and patches of timber which relieve
them of monotony and enhance their beauty; and though marshes and sloughs
occur, they are of too small extent and too infrequent to affect the generally
attractive character of the country. The elevation of the rolling prairies
is generally so uniform, that even the summits between streams flowing in
opposite directions exhibit no peculiar features to distinguish them from
the ordinary character of the valley slopes."
</p><p>
I think I cannot do a better service to the emigrant or
settler than to quote a part of the report made by Mr. A. W. Tinkham, descriptive
of his route from St. Paul to Fort Union. His exploration, under Gov. Stevens,
was made in the summer of 1853; and he has evidently given an impartial account
of the country. I begin with it where he crosses the Mississippi in the vicinity
of St. Cloud. The part quoted embraces the route for a distance of two hundred
and ninety-five miles; the first seventy miles of which was due west&mdash;the
rest of the route being a little north of west.
</p><p>
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0160" n="149"/>
<hi rend="italic">"June </hi>9. Ferried across the Mississippi River, here
some six hundred to eight hundred feet wide&mdash;boating the camp equipage,
provisions, &amp;c., and swimming the animals; through rich and fertile prairies,
variegated with the wooded banks of Sauk River, a short distance on the left,
with the wooded hills on either side, the clustered growth of elm, poplar,
and oak, which the road occasionally touches; following the 'Red River trail,'
we camp at Cold Spring Brook, with clear, cool water, good grass, and wood.
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">"June </hi>10. Cold Spring Brook is a small brook about
ten feet across, flowing through a miry slough, which is very soft and deep,
and previous to the passage of the wagons, had, for about two hundred feet
distance, been bridged in advance by a causeway of round or split logs of
the poplar growth near by; between this and the crossing of Sauk River are
two other bad sloughs, over one of which are laid logs of poplar, and over
the other the wagons were hauled by hand, after first removing the loads.
Sauk River is crossed obliquely with a length of ford some three hundred
feet&mdash;depth of water four-and-a-half to five feet; goods must be boated or
rafted over, the river woods affording the means of building a raft; camped
immediately after crossing; wood, water, and grass good and abundant.
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">"June </hi>11. Over rolling prairies, without wood on
the trail, although generally in sight on the right or left, with occasional
small ponds and several bad 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0161" n="150"/>
sloughs, across which the wagons were hauled
over by hand to Lake Henry&mdash;a handsome, wooded lake; good wood and grass;
water from small pond; not very good.
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">"June </hi>13. Passing over rolling prairies to a branch
of Crow River, the channel of which is only some twenty feet wide and four
or five feet deep; but the water makes back into the grass one hundred feet
or more from the channel as early in the season as when crossed by the train.
Goods boated over; wagons by hand and with ropes; no wood on the stream;
several small lakes, not wooded, are on either side of the trail, with many
ducks, geese, and plovers on them: encamp at Lightning Lake, a small and
pretty lake, sufficiently well wooded on the borders for camping purposes;
good water, wood, and grass, and abounding with fish.
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">"June </hi>18. Over rolling prairie with small pools
and marshes, to a swift running stream about twenty feet wide, three feet
deep, a branch of Chippewa River; heavily rolling ground with stony knolls
and granite boulders, to White Bear Lake, a large handsome lake, with mingled
open and woodland.
</p><p>
"Broken rolling ground to camp, a mile off the Red River
trail, and near a small wooded lake. Two small brooks have to be crossed
in the interval, and being somewhat deep and with abrupt sides, are troublesome
crossings.
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">"June</hi> 20. Rolling prairie country, with small marshes
and ponds to a tributary of South Branch. 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0162" n="151"/>
Swift running stream, gravelly
bottom, fifteen feet wide, three to four feet deep; with care in selection
good crossing was obtained for the wagons; a wooded lake is a short distance
to the right of trail.
</p><p>
"Small rivulet, whose banks are marshy and soft.
</p><p>
"Prairies, with small marshes and ponds to a swift running
brook, six feet wide.
</p><p>
"Prairie to Pike Lake and camp of St. Grover; a handsome
lake of about a mile in diameter, said to abound in pike; well wooded on
its south border; grass, water, and wood, for camping, abundant and good.
</p><p>
"Rolling prairie with knolls; several ponds and marshes,
with an intervening brook about six feet wide, and rather difficult of passage,
from the abruptness of its banks, to a small brook, the outlet of a small
and partially wooded lake or pond.
</p><p>
"Rolling prairie, with grassy, swelling knolls, small ponds
and marshes, to Chippeway River; camp of odometer wagon on edge of river;
water and grass good; no wood.
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">"June </hi>24. Crossed Chippeway River, one hundred and
twenty-four feet wide, three to six feet deep; goods boated over, and the
animals swimming; wagon hauled through the water by a rope attached to the
tongue, and with the aid of the mules; camped on Elk Lake, a small and pretty
lake, well wooded, and with luxuriant grass; good water.
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">"June</hi> 25. Trail passes over prairies with a rich

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0163" n="152"/>
heavy grass (this is a hundred miles west of the Mississippi River), about
eighteen inches high, winding between wooded lakes to a heavy ravine, with
a small and sluggish rivulet in its bottom; sides steep, and laborious for
the wagon train.
</p><p>
"Prairie sloping towards the western branch of the Chippeway
River; a stream when crossed, about one hundred and forty feet wide, three
or four feet deep, with a marked current and firm bottom; no wood.
</p><p>
"Camp on a small lake, fairly wooded, with luxuriant grass,
and good water.
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">"June</hi> 27. Undulating prairie, rich soil, covered
with a heavy growth of grass, with small ponds and marshes; woods continue
in sight a short distance on the left of Elbow Lake, a well wooded lake,
of form indicated by its name.
</p><p>
"Rolling prairie, with two bad sloughs, to Rabbit River,
which is crossed with the wagon with but little difficulty, where it issues
from a small lake. It is a small stream, but spreads out from one hundred
to three hundred feet, with marshy borders; camp on the small lake, with
good grass, wood, and water.
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">"June </hi>28. Rolling ground, with small ponds and marshes,
to a small brook twelve feet wide; the Bois des Sioux prairie, a smooth,
flat prairie, without knoll or undulation&mdash;an immense plain, apparently level,
covered with a tall, coarse, dark-colored grass, and unrelieved with the
sight of a tree or shrub; firm bottom, but undoubtedly wet in spring; small
brook, when the train made a noon halt.
</p><p>
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0164" n="153"/>
"Same smooth prairie as above to Bois des Sioux River,

occasionally interrupted with open sloughs to Wild Rice River, and camp with
wood, water, and abundant grass.
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">"June</hi> 30. Wild Rice River, about forty feet wide
and five and a half feet deep, with muddy and miry bottom and sides, flowing
in a canal-like channel, some twenty feet below prairie level; river skirted
with elm&mdash;bridged from the steep banks, being too miry to sustain the animals,
detaining the train but little more than half-a-day; small brook without
wood, flowing in a broad channel cut out through the prairie; crossing miry,
but made passable for the wagon by strewing the bottom with mown grass.
</p><p>
"Firm prairie to camp on edge of above small stream; good
grass and water; no wood; elk killed by hunter.
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">"July </hi>1. Smooth prairie extending to Shayenne River;
sand knolls, ponds, and marshes frequent as the river is approached. The
marshes were not miry&mdash;firmer bottom; good wagon road; night encampment on

train; wood abundant; river water good;
many catfish caught in river.
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">"July</hi> 2. Shayenne River, sixty feet wide, fourteen
feet deep; river had been previously bridged by Red River train, from the
poplars and other trees growing on the river, and this bridge we made use
of in crossing our wagons; camp on the west bank of the river; water, wood,
and grass good.
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">"July </hi>4. Prairie undulation, interrupted with marshes,
small ponds and occasional small rivulets, to Maple River, about twenty-five
feet wide, three and a half feet deep, firm bottom, and easily passed by
the wagons; river tolerably well wooded, and the camp on its edge is furnished
with water, wood, and good grass. The rich black soil of the valley of this
stream is noticeable.
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">"July </hi>5. To a small stream thirty feet wide, two
feet deep, clayey bottom, easily crossed by the wagons; prairie high, firm,
and almost level for some thirteen miles, becoming more rolling and with
small ponds in the last seven miles of the march; on the edge of some of
the ponds are salt incrustations; camp on the river; water good; grass good;
no wood, and the bois de vache is used for fuel.
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">"July </hi>6. Country wet and marshy; not a tree in sight;
prairie with low ridges and knolls, and great number of ponds and marshes;
night's camp by a small pond; no wood, but plenty of bois de vache; grass

for some half dozen miles; bordering on the river the ground is broken with
deep coulees and ravines, and to keep away from them the train kept at some
distance from the river, encamping by a small marshy pond; no wood; plenty
of bois de vache; grass good; water tolerable; first buffalo killed to-day.
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">"July </hi>8. Prairie swelling with ridges; descend to
the Shayenne, which flows some one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet
below the prairie by a steep hill; camp in the bottom of the river; wood
and water good; grass rather poor; the bottom of the Shayenne, some half
a mile wide, is often soft and miry, but when crossed by the train firm and
dry.
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">"July </hi>9. Cross the Shayenne, fifty feet wide, three
and a half feet deep; immediate banks some ten feet high, and requiring some
digging to give passage to the wagons.

<p>
I WAS up by the gray dawn of the morning of yesterday,
and after an early but excellent breakfast, crossed the river from St. Cloud,
in order to meet the stage at Sauk Rapids. As we came up on the main road,
the sight of a freshly made rut, of stage-wheel size, caused rather a disquieting
apprehension that the stage had passed. But my nerves were soon quieted by
the assurance from an early hunter, who was near by shooting prairie chickens
while they were yet on the roost, that the stage had not yet come. So we
kept on to the spacious store where the post office is kept; where I waited
and waited for the stage to come which was to bring me to St. Paul. It did
not arrive till eight o'clock. I thought if every one who had a part to perform
in starting off the stage from Watab (for it had started out from there that
morning), was obliged to make the entire journey of 80 miles to St. Paul
in the 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0168" n="157"/>
stage, they would prefer to get up a little earlier rather than have
the last part of the trip extended into "the dead waist and middle of the
night." I remarked to the driver, who is a very clever young man, that the
stage which left St. Paul started as early as five o'clock, and I could not
see why it was not as necessary to start as early in going down, inasmuch
as the earlier we started the less of the night darkness we had to travel
in. He perfectly agreed with me, and attributed his inability to start earlier
to the dilatory arrangements at the hotel. When jogging along at about eleven
at night between St. Anthony and the city, I could not help begrudging every
minute of fair daylight which had been wasted. The theory of Judge Story,
that it don't make much difference when a man gets up in the morning, provided
he is wide awake after he is up, will do very well, perhaps, except when
one is to start on a journey in the stage.
</p><p>
I took a seat by the driver's side, the weather being clear
and mild, and had an unobstructed and delightful view of every object, and
there seemed to be none but pleasant objects in range of the great highway.
Though there is, between every village, population enough to remind one
constantly that he is in a settled country, the broad extent yet unoccupied
proclaims that there is still room enough. Below Sauk Rapids a good deal
of the land on the road side is in the hands of speculators. This, it is
understood, is on the east side of the Mississippi. 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0169" n="158"/>
On the west side there
are more settlements. But yet there are many farms, with tidy white cottages;
and in some places are to be seen well-arranged flower-gardens. The most
attractive scenery to me, however, was the ample corn-fields, which, set
in a groundwork of interminable virgin soil, are pictures which best reflect
the true destiny and usefulness of an agricultural region. We met numerous
teams heavily laden with furniture or provisions, destined for the different
settlements above. The teams are principally drawn by two horses; and, as
the road is extremely level and smooth, are capable of taking on as much
freight as under other circumstances could be drawn by four horses. Mules
do not appear to be appreciated up this way so much as in Missouri or Kentucky.
Nor was it unusual to meet light carriages with a gentleman and lady, who,
from the luggage, &amp;c., aboard, appeared to have been on somewhat of an
extensive shopping expedition. And I might as well say here, if I havn't
yet said it, that the Minnesotians are supplied with uncommonly good horses.
I do not remember to have seen a mean horse in the territory. I suppose,
as considerable pains are taken in raising stock, poor horses are not raised
at all; and it will not pay to import poor ones. A company of surveyors whom
we met excited a curiosity which I was not able to solve. It looked odd enough
to see a dozen men walking by the side or behind a small one-horse cart;
the latter containing some sort of baggage 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0170" n="159"/>
which was covered over, as it
appeared, with camping fixtures. It was more questionable whether the team
belonged to the men than that the men were connected with the team. The men
were mostly young and very intelligent-looking, dressed with woollen shirts
as if for out door service, and I almost guessed they were surveyors; yet
still thought they were a party of newcomers who had concluded to club together
to make their preemption claim. But surveyors they were.
</p><p>
The town of Humboldt is the county seat for Sherburne county.
It lies between the Mississippi and Snake rivers. The part of the town which
I saw was a very small part. Mr. Brown's residence, which is delightfully
situated on the shore of a lake, is at once the court house and the post
office, besides being the general emporium and magnate of Humboldt business
and society. Furthermore, it is the place where the stage changes horses
and where passengers on the down trip stop to dine. It was here we stopped
to dine; and as the place had been a good deal applauded for its table-d'hote,
a standard element of which was said to be baked fish, right out of the big
lake, I at least had formed very luxurious expectations. Mr. Brown was away.
We had met his lively countenance on his way up to a democratic caucus. Perhaps
that accounted for our not having baked fish, for fish we certainly did not
have. The dinner was substantial, however, and yielded to appetites which
had been sharpened by a 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0171" n="160"/>
half day's inhalation of serene October air. We had
all become infused with a spirit of despatch; and were all ready to start,
and did start, in half an hour from the time we arrived at the house.
</p><p>
We had not proceeded far after dinner before meeting the
Monticello stage, which runs between the thriving village of that name&mdash;on
the west bank of the Mississippi&mdash;and St. Paul. It carries a daily mail.
There were several passengers aboard.
</p><p>
One little incident in our afternoon travel I will mention,
as it appeared to afford more pleasure to the rest of the passengers than
it did to me. Where the stage was to stop for fifteen or twenty minutes,
either to change mail or horses, I had invariably walked on a mile, if I
could get as far, for the sake of variety and exercise. So when we came to
the pretty village of Anoka (at the mouth of Rum River), where the mail was
to be changed, I started on foot and alone. But unfortunately and unconsciously
I took the wrong road. I had walked a mile I think&mdash;for twenty minutes at
least had expired since I started&mdash;and being in the outskirts of the town,
in the midst of farms and gardens, turned up to a garden-fence, on the other
side of which a gentleman of professional&mdash;I rather thought clerical
appearance&mdash;was feeding a cow on pumpkins. I had not seen pumpkins so abundant
since my earliest youth, when I used to do a similar thing. I rather thought
too that the gentleman whom I accosted was a Yankee, 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0172" n="161"/>
and after talking a
few minutes with him, so much did he exceed me in asking questions, that
I felt sure he was one. How thankful I ought to be that he was one! for otherwise
it is probable he would not have ascertained where, and for what purpose,
I was walking. He informed me I was on the wrong road; that the stage took
a road further west, which was out of sight; and that I had better go on
a little further and then cross the open prairie. Then for the first time
did I notice that the road I had taken was but a street, not half so much
worn as the main road. I followed his friendly advice, and feeling some despair
I hastened on at a swift run, and as I advanced towards where I thought the
right road ought to be, though I could neither see it nor the stage, "called
so loud that all the hollow deep of"&mdash;the prairies might have resounded.
At last, when quite out of breath and hoarse with loud vociferation, I descried
the stage rolling on at a rapid rate. Then I renewed my calls, and brought
it up standing. After clambering over a few fences, sweating and florid,
I got to the stage and resumed my seat, amidst the pleasant merriment of
the passengers. The driver was kind enough to say that he began to suspect
I had taken the wrong road, and was about to turn round and come after me&mdash;that
he certainly would not have left me behind, &amp;c. I was happy, nevertheless,
that my mistake did not retard the stage. But I do not intend to abandon

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0173" n="162"/>
the practice of walking on before the stage whenever it stops to change horses.
</p><p>
Just in the edge of twilight, and when we were a little
way this side of Coon Creek, where we had changed horses again, we came in
sight of a large fire. It was too much in one spot to be a prairie fire;
and as we drove on the sad apprehension that it was a stack of hay was confirmed.
The flames rose up in wide sheets, and cast a steady glare upon the landscape.
It was a gorgeous yet a dismal sight. It always seems worse to see grain
destroyed by fire than ordinary merchandise. Several stacks were burning.
We saw that the usual precaution against prairie fires had been taken. These
consist in ploughing several furrows around the stack, or by burning the
grass around it to prevent the flames from reaching it. It was therefore
suspected that some rascal had applied the torch to the hay; though for
humanity's sake we hoped it was not so. The terrible prairie fires, which
every autumn waste the western plains, are frequently started through the
gross carelessness of people who camp out, and leave their fires burning.
</p><p>
Some of us took supper at St. Anthony. I cannot say much
of the hotel <hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="lat">de facto</foreign></hi>. The table was not as good as I found on the
way at other places above. There is a hotel now being built there out of
stone, which I am confident will exceed anything in the territory, if we
except the Fuller House. It is possible 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0174" n="163"/>
we all felt invigorated and improved
by the supper, for we rode the rest of the way in a very crowded stage without
suffering any exhibition of ill temper to speak of, and got into St. Paul
at last, when it was not far from eleven; and after seventy-five miles of
staging, the luxurious accommodations of the Fuller House seemed more inviting
than ever.

PROGRESS.</head>
<epigraph><p>
Rapid growth of the North-West&mdash;Projected railroads&mdash;Territorial system of
the United States&mdash;Inquiry into the cause of Western progress&mdash;Influence
of just laws and institutions&mdash;Lord Bacon's remark.
</p></epigraph>
<opener><dateline><name type="place">ST. PAUL, </name><date value="1856-10">October, 1856.</date></dateline></opener>
<p>
THE progress which has characterized the settlement of
the territory of Minnesota, presents to the notice of the student of history
and political economy some important facts. The growth of a frontier community,
so orderly, so rapid, and having so much of the conservative element in it,
has rarely been instanced in the annals of the world. In less time than it
takes the government to build a custom house we see an unsettled territory
grown to the size of a respectable state, in wealth, in population, in power.
A territory, too, which ten years ago seemed to be an incredible distance
from the civilized portions of the country; and which was thought by most
people to be in a latitude that would defeat the energy and the toil of man.
Today it could bring into the field a larger army than Washington took command
of at the beginning of our revolution!
</p><p>
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0176" n="165"/>
In 1849, the year of its organization, the population of
the territory was 4780; now it is estimated to be nearly 200,000. In 1852
there were 42 post offices in the territory, now there are 253. The number
of acres of public land sold during the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1852,
was 15,258. For the year ending 30th June, 1856, the number of acres sold
was 1,002,130.
</p><p>
When we contemplate the headlong progress of Western growth
in its innumerable evidences of energy, we admit the truth of what the Roman
poet said&mdash;<hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="lat">nil mortalibus ardum est</foreign></hi>&mdash;that there is nothing too difficult
for man. In the narrative of his exploration to the Mississippi in 1820,
along with General Cass, Mr. Schoolcraft tells us how Chicago then appeared.
"We found," says he, <hi rend="italic">"four or five families living here."</hi> Four or
five families was the extent of the population of Chicago in 1820! In 1836
it had 4853 inhabitants. In 1855 its population was 85,000. The history of
many western towns that have sprung up within ten years is characterized
by much the same sort of thrift. Unless some terrible scourge shall come
to desolate the land, or unless industry herself shall turn to sloth, a few
more years will present the magnificent spectacle of the entire domain stretching
from this frontier to the Pacific coast, transformed into a region of culture,
"full of life and splendor and joy."
</p><p>
At present there are no railroads in operation in 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0177" n="166"/>
Minnesota;
but those which are already projected indicate, as well as any statistics,
the progress which is taking place. The Chicago, St. Paul, and Fond-du-Lac
Railroad was commenced some two years ago at Chicago, and over 100 miles
of it are completed. It is to run <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Hudson in Wisconsin, Stillwater,
St. Paul, and St. Anthony in Minnesota to the western boundary of the territory.
Recently it has united with the Milwaukee and La Cross Road, which secures
several millions of acres of valuable land, donated by congress, and which
will enable the stockholders to complete the road to St. Paul and St. Anthony
within two years. A road has been surveyed from the head of Lake Superior
<hi rend="italic">via</hi> St. Paul to the southern line of the territory, and will soon
be worked. The Milwaukee and Mississippi Railroad Company will in a few weeks
have their road completed to Prairie du Chien, and are extending it on the
east side of the Mississippi to St. Paul. Another road is being built up
the valley of the Red Cedar River in Iowa to Minneapolis. The Keokuck road
is in operation over fifty miles, and will soon be under contract to St.
Paul. This road is to run <hi rend="italic">via</hi> the valley of the Des Moines River,
through the rich coal fields of Iowa, and will supply the upper Mississippi
and Lake Superior region with coal.
</p><p>
The Green Bay and Minnesota Railroad Company has been organized
and the route selected. This road will soon be commenced. The active men

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0178" n="167"/>
engaged in the enterprise reside in Green Bay and Stillwater. A company has
been formed and will soon commence a road from Winona to the western line
of the territory. The St. Anthony and St. Paul Railroad Company will have
their line under contract early the coming season. The Milwaukee and La Cross
Company propose continuing their road west through the valley of Root River,
through Minnesota to the Missouri River. Another company has been formed
for building a road from the head of Lake Superior to the Red River of the
North.<ref target="n1.13.1" n="7">1</ref> Such are some of the railroad enterprises which are under way,
and which will contribute at an early day to develop the opulent resources
of the territory. A railroad through this part of the country to the Pacific
is among the probable events of the present generation.
</p><p>
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0179" n="168"/>
It may be well to pause here a moment and inquire into
the causes which contribute so wonderfully to build up empire in our
north-western domain. 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0180" n="169"/>
The territorial system of the United States has some
analogy, it is true, to the colonial system of Great Britain&mdash;not the colonial
system which existed 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0181" n="170"/>
in the days of the stamp act&mdash;but that which a wiser
statesmanship has more recently inaugurated. The relation between the general
government and our territories is like that of guardian and ward&mdash;the relation
of a protector, not that of a master. Nor can we find in the history of antiquity
any such relationship between colonies and the mother country, whether we
consider the system of Phoenicia, where first was exhibited the doctrine
of non-intervention, or the tribute-paying colonies of Carthage. That system
which was peculiar to Greece, "resting not on state contrivances and economical
theories, but on religious sympathies and ancestral associations," came as
near perhaps in spirit to ours as any on record. The patronage which the
government bestows on new territories is one of the sources of their growth
which ought not to be overlooked. Instead of making the territory a dependency
and drawing from it a tax, the government pays its political expenses, builds
its roads, and gives it a fair start in the world.
</p><p>
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0182" n="171"/>
Another cause of the successful growth of our territories
in general, and of Minnesota in particular, is the ready market which is
found in the limits of the territory for everything which can be raised from
a generous soil or wrought by industrious hands. The farmer has a ready market
for everything that is good to eat or to wear; the artisan is driven by unceasing
demands upon his skill. This arises from extensive emigration. Another reason,
also, for the rapid growth of the territory, is, that the farmer is not delayed
by forests, but finds, outside of pleasant groves of woodland, a smooth,
unencumbered soil, ready for the plough the first day he arrives.
</p><p>
But if a salubrious climate, a fertile soil, clear and
copious streams, and other material elements, can be reckoned among its physical
resources, there are other elements of empire connected with its moral and
political welfare which are indispensable. Why is it that Italy is not great?
Why is it the South American republics are rusting into abject decay? Is
it because they have not enough physical resources, or because their climate
is not healthy? Certainly not. It is because their political institutions
are rotten and oppressive; because ignorance prevents the growth of a wholesome
public opinion. It is the want of the right sort of men and institutions
that there is
<q>"Sloth in the mart and schism within the temple."</q>
"Let states that aim at greatness," says Lord 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0183" n="172"/>
Bacon, "take
heed how their nobility and gentlemen do multiply too fast; for that maketh
the common subject to be a peasant and base swain, driven out of heart, and,
in effect, but a gentleman's laborer." He who seeks for the true cause of
the greatness and thrift of our northwestern states will find it not less
in the influence of just laws and the education of all classes of men, than
in the existence of productive fields and in the means of physical wealth.

    <note id="n1.13.1" n="7"><p>1 The following highly instructive article on navigation,
I take from The <hi rend="italic">Pioneer and Democrat </hi>(St. Paul), of the 20th
November:
</p><p>
"GROWTH OF THE STEAMBOATING BUSINESS&mdash;THE SEASON OF 1856.
</p><p>
&mdash;About ten years after the first successful attempt at steamboat navigation
on the Ohio River, the first steamboat that ever ascended the Upper Mississippi
River to Fort Snelling, arrived at that post. This was the 'Virginia,' a
stern-wheel boat, which arrived at the Port in the early part of May, 1823.
From 1823 to 1844 there were but few arrivals each year&mdash;sometimes not more
than two or three. The steamers running on the Upper Mississippi, at that
time, were used altogether to transport supplies for the Indian traders and
the troops stationed at Fort Snelling. Previous to the arrival of the Virginia,
keel boats were used for this purpose, and sixty days' time, from St. Louis
to the Fort, was considered a good trip.
</p><p>
"By a reference to our files, we are enabled to present,
at a glance, the astonishing increase in steamboating business since 1844.
The first boat to arrive that year, was the Otter, commanded by Captain Harris.
The following table presents the number of arrivals since that time:&mdash;

</p><p>
"In 1851, three boats went up the Minnesota River, and
in 1852, one boat ran regularly up that stream during the season. In 1853,
the business required an average of one boat per day. In 1854, the business
had largely increased, and in 1855, the arrivals of steamers from the Minnesota,
amounted to 119.
</p><p>
"The present season, on the Mississippi, has been a very
prosperous one, and the arrivals at St. Paul exhibit a gratifying increase
over any preceding year, notwithstanding the season of navigation has been
two weeks shorter than last season. Owing to the unusually early gorge in
the river at Hastings, upwards of fifty steamers bound for this port, and
heavily laden with merchandise and produce, were compelled to discharge their
cargoes at Hastings and Stillwater.
</p><p>
"Navigation this season opened on the 18th of April. The
Lady Franklin arrived on the evening of that day from Galena. Previous to
her arrival, there had been eighteen arrivals at our landing from the head
of Lake Pepin, and twelve arrivals at the foot of the lake, from Galena and
Dubuque.
</p><p>
"During the present season, seventy-eight different steamers
have arrived at our wharf, from the points mentioned in the following table.

<p>
THE territory of Minnesota according to its present boundaries
embraces an area of 141,839 square miles exclusive of water;&mdash;a domain four
times as large as the State of Ohio, and twelve times as large as Holland,
when her commerce was unrivalled and her fleets ruled the sea. Its limits
take in three of the largest rivers of North America; the Mississippi, the
Missouri, and the Red River of the North. Though remote from the sea board,
ships can go out from its harbors to the ocean in two if not three different
channels. Its delightful scenery of lakes and water-falls, of prairie and
woodland, are not more alluring to the tourist, than are its invigorating
climate and its verdant fields attractive to the husbandman. It has been
organized seven years; and its resources have become so much developed, and
its population so large, there is a general disposition among the people
to have a state organization, 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0187" n="176"/>
and be admitted into the Confederacy of the
Union.<ref target="n2.1.1" n="8">1</ref> A measure of this kind is not now premature: on the contrary, it
is not for the interest of the general government any longer to defray the
expenses of the territory; and the adoption of a state organization, throwing
the taxes upon the people, would give rise to a spirit of rivalry and emulation,
a watchfulness as to the system of public expenditures, and a more jealous
regard for the proper development of the physical resources of the state.
The legislature which meets in January (1857), will without doubt take the
subject into consideration, and provide for a convention to frame a constitution.
</p><p>
This being the condition of things, the manner in which
the territory shall be divided&mdash;for no one can expect the new state will
embrace the whole extent of the present territory&mdash;becomes a very interesting
question. Some maintain, I believe, that the territory should be divided
by a line running east and west. That would include in its limits the country
bordering, for some distance, on the Missouri River; possibly the head of
navigation 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0188" n="177"/>
of the Red River of the North. But it is hardly probable that
a line of this description would give Minnesota any part of Lake Superior.
Others maintain that the territory should be divided by a line running north
and south; say, for instance, along the valley of the Red River of the North.
Such a division would not give Minnesota any of the Missouri River. But it
would have the benefit of the eastern valley of the Red River of the North;
of the entire region surrounding the sources of the Mississippi; and of the
broad expanse which lies on Lake Superior. The question is highly important,
not only to Minnesota, but to the territory which will be left outside of
it; and it should be decided with a due regard to the interests of both.<ref target="n2.1.2" n="9">1</ref>

<opener><dateline><name type="place">WASHINGTON, D. C. </name><date value="1856-12-10">Dec. 10, 1856.</date></dateline></opener>
<p>DEAR SIR:&mdash;Your note of the 6th instant is before me; and
I will premise my reply by saying that the suggestions I shall offer to your
inquiries are based upon my knowledge of the condition of the territory in
1849, which circumstances beyond my acquaintance may have materially modified
since.
</p><p>
The important points to be secured for the new state to
be erected in the territory of Minnesota, seem to be:&mdash;first a harbor on
Lake Superior, easily accessible from the West; second, the whole course
of the Mississippi to the Iowa line; and, third, the head of navigation of
the Red River of the North. It is unnecessary to point out the advantages
of securing these features to the new state; and to do so without enclosing
too many square miles of territory, I would suggest the following boundaries,
viz.:
</p><p>
Commencing on the 49th parallel of latitude, where it is
intersected by the Red River of the North, to follow the line of deepest
water of that river to the mouth of the Bois des Sioux (or Sioux Wood) River;
thence up the middle of that stream to the south-west point of Lake Traverse;
thence following a due south line to the northern boundary of the state of
Iowa (43 degrees 30' north latitude); thence along this boundary line to
the Mississippi River; thence up the middle of the Mississippi River to the
mouth of the St. Croix River; thence along the western boundary line of the
state of Wisconsin to its intersection with the St. Louis River; thence down
the middle of that river to Lake Superior; thence following the coast of
the lake to its intersection with the boundary line between the United States
and the British possessions, and following this boundary to the place of
beginning.
</p><p>
These boundaries will enclose an area of about 65,000 square
miles of the best agricultural and manufacturing region in the territory,
and will form a state of unrivalled advantages. That portion of the territory
set aside by the boundary line will be of little value for many years to
come. It presents features differing but little from the region of prairie
and table land west of the frontier of Missouri and Arkansas. From this,
of course, are to be excepted the western half of the valley of the Red River
and of the Big Sioux River, which are as productive as any portion of the
territory, which, with the region enclosed between them, would contain arable
land sufficient for another state of smaller dimensions.
</p><p>
As you will find stated and fully explained in my report
of February, 1850, the valley of the Red River of the North must find an
outlet for its productions towards the south, either through the great lakes
or by the Mississippi River. The necessity, therefore, of connecting the
head of its navigation with a harbor on Lake Superior, and a port on the
Mississippi, is sufficiently apparent. As each of these lines of railroad
will run through the most fertile and desirable portion of the territory,
they will have a value far beyond the mere object of transporting the products
of the Red River valley.
</p><p>
The construction of these roads&mdash;in fact the mere location
of them&mdash;will secure a population along the routes at once, and will open
a country equal to any in the world.
</p><p>
As these views have been fully elaborated in my report
of 1850, I refer you to that paper for the detailed information upon which
these views and suggestions are based.

If the division last mentioned&mdash;or one on that plan&mdash;is
made, there will then be left west of the state of Minnesota an extent of
country embracing 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0190" n="179"/>
more than half of the territory as it now is; extending
from latitude 42 degrees 30' to the 49th degree; and embracing six degrees
of longitude&mdash;97th to 103d&mdash;at its northern extreme. The Missouri River would
constitute nearly the whole of its western boundary. In the northerly part
the Mouse and Pembina Rivers are among its largest streams; in the middle
flows the large and finely wooded Shayenne, "whose valley possesses a fertile
soil and offers many inducements to its settlement;" while towards the south
it would have the Jacques, the Big Sioux, the Vermillion, and the head waters
of the St. Peter's. In its supply of copious streams, nature seems there
to have been lavish. Of the Big Sioux River, M. Nicollet says, its Indian
name means that it is continuously lined with wood; that its length cannot
be less than three hundred and fifty miles. "It flows through a beautiful
and fertile country; amidst which the Dacotahs, inhabiting the valleys of
the St. Peter's and Missouri, have always kept up summer establishments on
the borders of the adjoining lakes, whilst they hunted the river banks. Buffalo
herds are confidently expected to be met with here at all seasons of the
year." The Jacques (the Indian name of which is <hi rend="italic">Tchan-sansan</hi>) "takes
its rise on the plateau of the Missouri beyond the parallel of 47 degrees
north; and after pursuing nearly a north and south course, empties into the
Missouri River below 43 degrees. It is deemed navigable with small hunting
canoes for between five hundred and six hundred miles; but 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0191" n="180"/>
below
<hi rend="italic">Otuhuoja</hi>, it will float much larger boats. The shores of the river
are generally tolerably well wooded, though only at intervals. Along those
portions where it widens into lakes, very eligible situations for farms would
be found." The same explorer says, the most important tributary of the Jacques
is the Elm River, which "might not deserve any special mention as a navigable
stream, but is very well worthy of notice on account of the timber growing
on its own banks and those of its forks." He further observes (Report, p.
46) that "the basin of the river Jacques, between the two coteaux and in
the latitude of <hi rend="italic">Otuhuoja</hi>, may be laid down as having a breadth of
eighty miles, sloping gradually down from an elevation of seven hundred to
seven hundred and fifty feet. These dimensions, of course, vary in the different
parts of the valley; but what I have said will convey some idea of the immense
prairie watered by the <hi rend="italic">Tchan-sansan</hi>, which has been deemed by all
travellers to those distant regions perhaps the most beautiful within the
territory of the United States."
</p><p>
The middle and northern part comprises an elevated plain,
of average fertility and tolerably wooded. Towards the south it is characterized
by bold undulations. The valley of the Missouri is narrow; and the bluffs
which border upon it are abrupt and high. The country is adapted to agricultural
pursuits, and though inferior as a general thing to much of Minnesota, affords
promise of
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0192" n="181"/>
thrift and properity in its future. It is blessed with a salubrious
climate. Dr. Suckley, who accompanied the expedition of Gov. Stevens through
that part of the West, as far as Puget Sound, says in his official report:
"On reviewing the whole route, the unequalled and unparalleled good health
of the command during a march of over eighteen hundred miles appears remarkable;
especially when we consider the hardships and exposures necessarily incident
to such a trip. Not a case of ague or fever occurred. Such a state of health
could only be accounted for by the great salubrity of the countries passed
through, and their freedom from malarious or other endemic disease."
</p><p>
Governor Stevens has some comprehensive remarks concerning
that part of the country in his report. "The Grand Plateau of the Bois des
Sioux and the Mouse River valley are the two keys of railroad communication
from the Mississippi River westward through the territory of Minnesota. The
Bois des Sioux is a river believed to be navigable for steamers of light
draught, flowing northward from Lake Traverse into the Red River of the North,
and the plateau of the Bois des Sioux may be considered as extending from
south of Lake Traverse to the south bend of the Red River, and from the Rabbit
River, some thirty miles east of the Bois des Sioux River, to the Dead Colt
hillock. This plateau separates the rivers flowing into Hudson's Bay from
those flowing into the Mississippi 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0193" n="182"/>
River. The Mouse River valley, in the
western portion of Minnesota, is from ten to twenty miles broad; is separated
from the Missouri River by the Coteau du Missouri, some six hundred feet
high, and it is about the same level as the parallel valley of the Missouri."
(Report, ch. 4.)
</p><p>
M. Nicollet was a scientific or matter of fact man, who
preferred to talk about "erratic blocks" and "cretaceous formations" rather
than to indulge in poetic descriptions. The outline which follows, however,
of the western part of the territory is what he considers "a faint description
of this beautiful country." "The basin of the Upper Mississippi is separated
in a great part of its extent from that of the Missouri, by an elevated plain;
the appearance of which, seen from the valley of the St. Peter's or that
of the Jacques, looming as it were a distant shore, has suggested for it
the name of <hi rend="italic">Coteau des Prairies</hi>. Its more appropriate designation
would be that of <hi rend="italic">plateau</hi>, which means something more than is conveyed
to the mind by the expression, a <hi rend="italic">plain</hi>. Its northern extremity is
in latitude 46 degrees, extending to 43 degrees; after which it loses its
distinctive elevation above the surrounding plains, and passes into rolling
prairies. Its length is about two hundred miles, and its general direction
N. N. W. and S. S. E. Its northern termination (called <hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="fre">Tete du Couteau</foreign></hi>
in consequence of its peculiar configuration) is not more than fifteen to
twenty miles across; its elevation above the level of the Big Stone Lake
is eight 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0194" n="183"/>
hundred and ninety feet, and above the ocean one thousand nine hundred
and sixteen feet. Starting from this extremity (that is, the head of the
Coteau), the surface of the plateau is undulating, forming many dividing
ridges which separate the waters flowing into the St. Peter's and the Mississippi
from those of the Missouri. Under the 44th degree of latitude, the breadth
of the Coteau is about forty miles, and its mean elevation is here reduced
to one thousand four hundred and fifty feet above the sea. Within this space
its two slopes are rather abrupt, crowned with verdure, and scolloped by
deep ravines thickly shaded with bushes, forming the beds of rivulets that
water the subjacent plains.
</p><p>
The Coteau itself is isolated, in the midst of boundless
and fertile prairies, extending to the west, to the north, and into the valley
of the St. Peter's.
</p><p>
The plain at its northern extremity is a most beautiful
tract of land diversified by hills, dales, woodland, and lakes, the latter
abounding in fish. This region of country is probably the most elevated between
the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson's Bay. From its summit, proceeding from its
western to its eastern limits, grand views are afforded. At its eastern border
particularly, the prospect is magnificent beyond description, extending over
the immense green turf that forms the basin of the Red River of the North,
the forest-capped summits of the <hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="fre">haugeurs des terres</foreign></hi> that surround
the sources of the Mississippi, the granitic valley of the Upper 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0195" n="184"/>
St. Peter's,
and the depressions in which are Lake Traverse and the Big Stone Lake. There
can be no doubt that in future times this region will be the summer resort
of the wealthy of the land." (pp. 9, 10.)
</p><p>
I will pass over what he says of the "vast and magnificent
valley of the Red River of the North," having before given some account of
that region, and merely give his description of the largest lake which lies
in the northern part of the territory: "The greatest extension of Devil's
Lake is at least forty miles,&mdash;but may be more, as we did not, and could
not, ascertain the end of the north-west bay, which I left undefined on the
map. It is bordered by hills that are pretty well wooded on one side, but
furrowed by ravines and coulees, that are taken advantage of by warlike parties,
both for attack and defence according to circumstances. The lake itself is
so filled up with islands and promontories, that, in travelling along its
shores, it is only occasionally that one gets a glimpse of its expanse. This
description belongs only to its wooded side; for, on the opposite side, the
shores, though still bounded by hills, are destitute of trees, so as to exhibit
an embankment to the east from ten to twelve miles long, upon an average
breadth of three-quarters of a mile. The average breadth of the lake may
be laid down at fifteen miles. Its waters appear to be the drainings of the
surrounding hills. We discovered no outlets in the whole extent of 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0196" n="185"/>
about
three-quarters of its contour we could explore. At all events, if there be
any they do not empty into the Red River of the North, since the lake is
shut up in that direction, and since we found its true geographical position
to be much more to the north than it is ordinarily laid down upon maps. A
single depression at its lower end would intimate that, in times of high
water, some discharge might possibly take place; but then it would be into
the <hi rend="italic">Shayenne</hi>." (p. 50.)
</p><p>
Such are some of the geographical outlines of the extensive
domain which will be soon organized as a new territory.
</p><p>
What will it be called? If the practice hitherto followed
of applying to territories the names which they have been called by their
aboriginal inhabitants is still adhered to, this new territory will have
the name of Dacotah. It is the correct or Indian name of those tribes whom
we call the Sioux; the latter being an unmeaning Indian-French word. Dacotah
means "united people," and is the word which the Indians apply to seven of
their bands.<ref target="n2.1.3" n="10">1</ref> 
    
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0197" n="186"/>These tribes formerly occupied the country south and south-west
of Lake Superior; from whence they were gradually driven towards the Missouri
and the Rocky Mountains by their powerful and dreaded enemies the Chippewas.
Since which time they have been the acknowledged occupants of the broad region
to which they have impressed a name. Several of the tribes, however, have
crossed the Missouri, between which and the Rocky Mountains they still linger
a barbaric life. We may now hope to realize the truth of Hiawatha's words:&mdash;

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0198" n="187"/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"After many years of warfare,
</l><l>Many years of strife and bloodshed,
</l><l>There is peace between the Ojibways
</l><l>And the tribe of the Dacotahs."
</l></lg></q>
</p><p>
If it be asked what will be done with these tribes when
the country comes to be settled, I would observe, as I have said, that the
present policy of the government is to procure their settlement on reservations.
This limits them to smaller boundaries; and tends favorably to their
civilization. I might also say here, that the title which the Indians have
to the country they occupy is that of occupancy. They have the natural right
to occupy the land; but the absolute and sovereign title is in the United
States. The Indians can dispose of their title to no party or power but the
United States. When, however, the government wishes to extinguish their title
of occupancy, it pays them a fair price for their lands according as may
be provided by treaty. The policy of our government towards the Indians is
eminently that of protection and preservation; not of conquest and extermination.
</p><p>
Dacotah is the name now applied to the western part of
Minnesota, and I am assured by the best informed men of that section, that
such will be the name of the territory when organized.

	<note id="n2.1.3" n="10"><seg type="note-symbol">1</seg> <p>The following description of the Dacotahs
is based on observations made in 1823. "The Dacotahs are a large and powerful
nation of Indians, distinct in their manners, language, habits, and opinions,
from the Chippewas, Sauks, Foxes, and Naheawak or Kilisteno, as well as from
all nations of the Algonquin stock. They are likewise unlike the Pawnees
and the Minnetarees or Gros Ventres. They inhabit a large district of country
which may be comprised within the following limits:&mdash;From Prairie du Chien,
on the Mississippi, by a curved line extending east of north and made to
include all the eastern tributaries of the Mississippi, to the first branch
of Chippewa River; the head waters of that stream being claimed by the Chippewa
Indians; thence by a line running west of north to the head of Spirit Lake;
thence by a westerly line to the Riveree de Corbeau; thence up that river
to its head, near Otter Tail Lake; thence by a westerly line to Red River,
and down that river to Pembina; thence by a south-westerly line to the east
bank of the Missouri near the Mandan villages; thence down the Missouri to
a point probably not far from Soldier's River; thence by a line running east
of north to Prairie du Chien.
</p><p>
This immense extent of country is inhabited by a nation
calling themselves, in their internal relations, the Dacotah, which means
the Allied; but who, in their external relations, style themselves the Ochente
Shakoan, which signifies the nation of seven (council) fires. This refers
to the following division which formerly prevailed among them, viz.:&mdash;

PREEMPTION FOR CITY OR TOWN SITES.
</p><p>
AT a late moment, and while the volume is in press, I am
enabled to present the following exposition of the Preemption Law, addressed
to the Secretary of the Interior by Mr. Attorney-General Cushing. (See "Opinions
of Attorneys General," vol. 7, 733-743&mdash;in press.)

<div2 type="section" id="d42">

PREEMPTION FOR CITY OR TOWN SITES.
</head>
<p>
Portions of the public lands, to the amount of three hundred
and twenty acres, may be taken up by individuals or preemptioners for city
or town sites.
</p><p>
The same rules as to proof of occupation apply in the case
of municipal, as of agricultural, preemption.
</p><p>
The statute assumes that the purposes of a city or town
have preference over those of trade or of agriculture.

<p>
SIR: Your communication of the 20th May, transmitting papers
regarding Superior City (so called) in the State of Wisconsin, submits for
consideration three precise questions of law; two of them presenting inquiry
of the legal relations of locations for town sites on the public domain,
and the third presenting inquiry of another matter, which, although pertinent
to the case, yet is comprehended in a perfectly distinct class of legal
relations.
</p><p>
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0215" n="204"/>
I propose, in this communication, to reply only upon the
two first questions.
</p><p>
The act of Congress of April 24, 1841, entitled "An act
to appropriate the proceeds of the sales of the public lands and to grant
preemption rights," contains, in section 10th, the following provisions:
"no lands reserved for the support of schools, nor lands acquired by either
of the two last treaties with the Miami tribe of Indians in the State of
Indiana, or which may be acquired of the Wyandot tribe of Indians in the
State of Ohio, or other Indian reservation to which the title has been or
may be extinguished by the United States at any time during the operation
of this act; no sections of lands reserved to the United States alternate
to other sections of land granted to any of the States for the construction
of any canal, railroad, or other public improvement; no sections or fractions
of sections included within the limits of any incorporated town; no portions
of the public lands which have been selected for the site of a city or town;
no parcel of a lot of land actually settled or occupied for the purposes
of trade and not agriculture; and no lands on which are situated any known
salines or mines, shall be liable to entry under or by virtue of this act."
(v Stat. at Large, p. 456.)
</p><p>
An act passed May 28, 1844, entitled "An act for the relief
of citizens of towns upon the lands of the United States under certain
circumstances," provides as follows:
</p><p>
"That whenever any portion of the surveyed public lands
has been or shall be settled upon and occupied as a town site, and therefore
not subject to entry under the existing preemption laws, it shall be lawful,
in case such town or place shall be incorporated, for the corporate authorities
thereof, and if not incorporated, for the judges of the county court for
the county in which such town may be situated, to enter at the proper land
office, and at the minimum price, the land so settled and occupied, in trust
for the several use and benefit of the several occupants thereof, according
to their respective interests; the execution of which trust, as to the disposal
of the lots in said town, and the proceeds of the sales thereof, 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0216" n="205"/>
to be conducted
under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the legislative
authority of the state or territory in which the same is situated; <hi rend="italic">Provided,
</hi>that the entry of the land intended by this act be made prior to the
commencement of a public sale of the body of land in which it is included,
and that the entry shall include only such land as is actually occupied by
the town, and be made in conformity to the legal subdivisions of the public
lands authorized by the act of the twenty-fourth of April, one thousand eight
hundred and twenty, and shall not in the whole exceed three hundred and twenty
acres; and <hi rend="italic">Provided</hi> also, that the act of the said trustees, not made
in conformity to the rules and regulations herein alluded to, shall be void
and of none effect:" * * * (v Stat. at Large, p. 687.)
</p><p>
Upon which statutes you present the following questions
of construction: "1st. What is the legal signification to be given to the
words, 'portions of the public lands which have been selected as the site
for a city or town,' which occur in the preemption law of 1841, and which
portions of the public lands are by said act exempted from its provisions?
Do they authorize selections by individuals with a view to the building thereon
of a city or town, or do they contemplate a selection made by authority of
some special law?
</p><p>
"Do the words in the act of 23d May, 1844, 'and that the
entry shall include only such land as is actually occupied by the town,'
restrict the entry to those quarter quarter-sections, or forty acre subdivisions,
alone, on which houses have been erected as part of said town, or do they
mean, only, that the entry shall not embrace any land not shown <hi rend="italic">by</hi> the
survey on the ground, or the plat of the town, to be occupied thereby, and
not to exceed 820 acres, which is to be taken by legal subdivisions, according
to the public survey, and to what species of 'legal subdivisions' is reference
made in said act of 1844?"
</p><p>
These questions, as thus presented by you, are abstract
questions of law,&mdash;namely, of the construction of statutes. 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0217" n="206"/>
They are distinctly
and clearly stated, so as not to require of me any investigation of external
facts to render them more intelligible. Nor do they require of me to attempt
to make application of them to any actual case, conflict of right, or controversy
either between private individuals or such individuals and the Government.
</p><p>
It is true that, accompanying your communication, there
is a great mass of representations, depositions, arguments, and other papers,
which show that the questions propounded by you are not speculative ones,
and that, on the contrary, they bear, in some way, on matters of interest,
public or private, to be decided by the Department. But those are matters
for you, not for me, to determine. You have requested my opinion of certain
points of law, to be used by you, so far as you see fit, in aid of such your
own determination. I am thus happily relieved of the task of examining and
undertaking to analyze the voluminous documents in the case: more especially
as your questions, while precise and complete in themselves, derive all needful
illustration from the very instructive report in the case of the present
Commissioner of Public Lands and the able brief on the subject drawn up in
your Department.
</p><p>
I. To return to the questions before me: the first is in
substance whether the words in the act of 1841,&mdash;" portions of the public
land which have been selected as the site for a city or a town,"&mdash;are to
be confined to cases of such selection in virtue of some special authority,
or by some official authority?
</p><p>
I think not, for the following reasons:
</p><p>
The statute does not by any words of legal intendment say
so.
</p><p>
The next preceding clause of the act, which speaks of lands
"included within the limits of any incorporated town," implies the contrary,
in making separate provision for a township existing by special or public
authority.
</p><p>
The next succeeding clause, which speaks of land "actually
settled or occupied for the purposes of trade and not agriculture," 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0218" n="207"/>
leads
to the same conclusion; for why should selection for a town site require
special authority any more than occupation for the purposes of trade?
</p><p>
The general scope of the act has the same tendency. Its
general object is to regulate, in behalf of individuals, the acquisition
of the public domain by preemption, after voluntary occupation for a certain
period of time, and under other prescribed circumstances. In doing this,
it gives a preference preemption to certain other uses of the public land,
by excluding such land from liability to ordinary preemption. Among the uses
thus privileged, and to which precedence in preemption is accorded, are,
1. "Sections, or fractions of sections included within the limits of any
incorporated town;" 2. "Portions of the public land which have been selected
for the site of a city or town;" and, 3. "Land actually settled or occupied
for the purposes of trade, and not agriculture." Now, it is not easy to see
any good reason why, if individuals may thus take voluntarily for the purposes
of agriculture,&mdash;they may not also take for the purposes of a city or town.
The statute assumes that the purposes of a city or town have preference over
those of trade, and still more over those of agriculture. Yet individuals
may take for either of the latter objects: <hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="lat">a fortiori </foreign></hi>they may take
for a city or town.
</p><p>
Why should it be assumed that individual action in this
respect is prohibited for towns any more than for trade or agriculture? It
does not concern the Government whether two persons preempt one hundred and
sixty acres each for the purposes of agriculture, or for the purpose of a
town, except that the latter object will, incidentally, be more beneficial
to the Government. Nor is there any other consideration of public policy
to induce the Government to endeavor to discourage the formation of towns.
Why, then, object to individuals taking up a given quantity of land in one
case rather than in the other?
</p><p>
Finally, the act of 1844 definitively construes the act
of 1841, and proves that the "selection" for town sites there spoken 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0219" n="208"/>
of may
be either by public authority or by individuals:&mdash;that the word is for that
reason designedly general, and without qualification, but must be fixed by
occupation. That act supposes public land to be "settled upon and occupied
as a town site," and "therefore" not subject to entry under the existing
preemption laws. This description identifies it with the land "selected for
the site of <hi rend="italic">a city</hi> or town," in the previous act. It limits the quantity
so to be selected, that is, settled or occupied, to three hundred and twenty
acres, and otherwise regulates the selection as hereinafter explained. It
then provides how such town site is to be entered and patented. If the town
be incorporated, then the <hi rend="italic">entry</hi> is to be made by its corporate
authorities. If the town be not incorporated, then it may be entered in the
name of the judges of the county court of the county, in which the projected
town lies, "in trust for the several use and benefit of the several occupants
thereof, according to their respective interests." Here we have express
recognition of voluntary selection and occupancy by individuals, and provision
for means by which legal title in their behalf may be acquired and patented.
</p><p>
I am aware that by numerous statutes anterior to the act
of 1841, provision is made for the <hi rend="italic">authoritative</hi> selection of town
sites in special cases; but such provisions do by no means exclude or contradict
the later enactment of a general provision of law to comprehend all cases
of selections for town sites, whether authoritative or voluntary. I think
the act of 1841, construed in the light of the complementary act of 1844,
as it must be, provides clearly for both contingencies or conditions of the
subject. Among the anterior acts, however, is one of great importance and
significancy upon this point, more especially as that act received exposition
at the time from the proper departments of the Government. I allude to the
act of June 22d, 1838, entitled "An act to grant preemption rights to settlers
on the public lands." This act, like that of 1841, contains a provision reserving
certain lands from ordinary preemption, among which are:
</p>
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0220" n="209"/>
<cit><q>"Any portions of public lands, surveyed or otherwise, which
have been actually selected as sites for cities or towns, lotted into smaller
quantities than eighty acres, and settled upon and occupied for the purposes
of trade, and not of agricultural cultivation and improvement, or any land
specially occupied or reserved for town lots, or other purposes, by authority
of the United States." </q><bibl>(v Stat. at Large, p. 251.)</bibl></cit>
<p>
Here the "selection" generally, and the "selection" by
authority are each provided for <hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="lat">eo nomine. </foreign></hi>It is obvious that the
provision in the latter case is made for certainty only; since, by the general
rules of statute construction, no ordinary claim of preemption could attach
to reservations made by authority of the United States. The effective provision
in the enactment quoted, must be selections not made by the authority of
the United States.
</p><p>
In point of fact the provision was construed by the Department
to include all voluntary selections: lands, says the circular of the General
Land Office of July 8, 1838, "which settlers have selected with a view of
building thereon a village or city."
</p><p>
It seems to me that the same considerations which induced
this construction of the word "selection" in the act of 1838, dictate a similar
construction of the same word in the subsequent act. Besides which, when
a word or words of a statute, which were of uncertain signification originally,
but which have been construed by the proper authority, are repented in a
subsequent statute, that is understood as being not a repetition merely of
the word with the received construction, but an implied legislative adoption
even of such construction.
</p><p>
II. The second question is of the construction of the act
of 1844, supplemental to that of 1841; and as the construction of the elder
derives aid from the language of the later one, so does that of the latter
from the former. The question is divisible into sub-questions.
</p><p>
1. Does the phrase "that the entry (for a town-site) shall

    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0221" n="210"/>
include only such land as is actually occupied by the town," restrict the
entry to those quarter quarter-sections, or forty acre subdivisions alone,
on which houses have been erected as part of said town?
</p><p>
2. What is the meaning of the phrase in the act "legal
subdivisions of the public lands," in "conformity" with which the entry must
be made?
</p><p>
I put the two acts together and find that they provide
for a system of preemptions for, among other things, agricultural occupation,
commercial or mechanical occupation, and municipal occupation.
</p><p>
In regard to agricultural occupation, the laws provide
that, in certain cases and conditions, one person may preempt one hundred
and sixty acres, and that in regard to municipal occupation a plurality of
persons may, in certain cases and conditions, preempt three hundred and twenty
acres. In the latter contingency, there is no special privilege as to quantity,
but a disability rather; for two persons together may preempt three hundred
and twenty acres by agricultural occupation, and afterwards convert the land
into a town site, and four persons together might in the same way secure
six hundred and forty acres, to be converted ultimately into the site of
a town; while the same four persons, selecting land for a town site, can
take only three hundred and twenty acres. In both forms the parties enter
at the minimum price of the public lands. The chief advantage which the
preemptors for municipal purposes enjoy, is, that they have by statute a
preference over agricultural preemptors, the land selected for a town site
being secured by statute against general and ordinary, that is, agricultural
preemption. In all other respects material to the present inquiry, we may
assume, for the argument's sake at least, that the two classes stand on a
footing of equality, as respects either the convicting interests of third
persons, or the rights of the Government.
</p><p>
Now, the rights of an agricultural preemptor we understand.
He is entitled, if he shall "make a settlement in person 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0222" n="211"/>
on the public lands," and
"shall inhabit and improve the same, and shall erect a dwelling thereon," to enter,
"by legal subdivisions, any number of acres not exceeding one hundred and sixty, or
a quarter-section of land, to include the residence of such claimant." (Act of 1841,
s. 10.) And of two settlers on "the same quarter-section of land," the earlier one
is to have the preference. (Sec. 11.)
</p><p>
Now, was it ever imagined that such claimant must personally
inhabit every quarter quarter-section of his claim? That he must have under
cultivation every quarter quarter-section? That he must erect a dwelling
on every quarter quarter-section? And that, if he failed to do this, any
such quarter of his quarter-section might be preempted by a later occupant?
</p><p>
There is no pretension that such is the condition of the
ordinary preemptor, and that he is thus held to inhabit, to cultivate, to
dwell on, every quarter quarter-section, under penalty of having it seized
by another preemptor, or entered in course by any public or private purchaser.
He is to provide, according to the regulations of the Land Office or otherwise,
indicia, by which the limits of his claim shall be known,&mdash;he must perform
acts of possession or intended ownership on the land, as notice to others;
and that suffices to secure his rights under the statute. It is not necessary
for him to cultivate every separate quarter of his quarter-section; it is
not necessary for him even to enclose each; it only needs that in good faith
he take possession, with intention of occupation and settlement, and proceed
in good faith to occupy and settle, in such time and in such manner, as belong
to the nature of agricultural occupation and settlement.
</p><p>
Why should there be a different rule in regard to occupants
for municipal preemption? The latter is, by the very tenor of the law, the
preferred object. Why should those interested in it be subject to special
disabilities of competing occupancy? I cannot conceive.
</p><p>
It is obvious that, in municipal settlement, as well as
agricultural, 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0223" n="212"/>
there must be space of time between the commencement and the
consummation of occupation. There will be a moment, when the equitable right
of the agricultural settler is fixed, although he have as yet done nothing
more in the way of inhabiting or improving than to cut a tree or drive a
stake into the earth. And it may be long before he improves each one of all
his quarter quarter-sections. So, in principle, it is in the case of settlement
for a town. We must deal with such things according to their nature. Towns
do not spring into existence consummate and complete. Nor do they commence
with eight houses, systematically distributed, each in the centre of a forty-acre
lot. And in the case of a town settlement of three hundred and twenty acres;
as well as that of a farm site of one hundred and sixty acres, all which
can be lawfully requisite to communicate to the occupants the right of preemption
to the block of land, including every one of its quarter quarter-sections,&mdash;is
improvement, or indication of the improvement of the entire block,&mdash;acts
of possession or use regarding it, consonant with the nature of the thing.
That, in a farm, will be the erection of a house and outhouses, cultivation,
and use of pasturage or woodland: in a town, it will be erecting houses or
shops, platting out the land, grading or opening streets, and the like signs
and marks of occupation or special destination.
</p><p>
The same considerations lead to the conclusion that it
would not be just to confine the proofs of occupation to facts existing at
its very incipiency. The inchoate or equitable right, as against all others,
begins from the beginning of the occupation: the ultimate sufficiency of
that occupation is to be determined in part by subsequent facts, which consummate
the occupation, and also demonstrate its <hi rend="italic"><foreign lang="lat">bona fides. </foreign></hi>If it were otherwise,
there would be an end of all the advantage expressly given by the statute
to priority of occupation. Take the case of agricultural preemptions for
example. A settler enters in good faith upon a quarter-section for preemption;
his entry, at first, attaches physically to no more than the 
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0224" n="213"/>
rood of land
on which he is commencing to construct a habitation. Is that entry confined
in effect to a single <hi rend="italic">quarter</hi> quarter? Can other settlers, the next
day, enter upon all the adjoining quarter quarters, and thus limit the first
settler to the single quarter quarter on which his dwelling is commenced?
Is all proof of occupation in his case, when he comes to prove up his title,
to be confined to acts anterior to the date of conflict? Clearly not. The
inchoate title of the first occupant ripens into a complete one by the series
of acts on his part subsequent to the original occupation.
</p><p>
In the statement of the case prepared in your office, it
is averred that numerous precedents exist in the Land Office, not only of
the allowance of town preemptions as the voluntary selection of individuals,
but also of the application to such preemption claims of the ordinary
construction of the word "occupation" habitually applied to agricultural
preemption claims. That is to say, it has been the practice of the Government,
not to consider municipal occupation "circumscribed by the forty-acre
subdivisions actually built upon; * * but that such occupation was (sufficiently)
evidenced, either by an actual survey, upon the ground, of said town into
streets, alleys, and blocks, or the publication of a plat of the same evidencing
the connection therewith of the public surveys, so as to give notice to others
of the extent of the town site:" all this, within the extreme limits, of
course, of the three hundred and twenty acres prescribed by the statute.
</p><p>
I think the practice of the Land Office in this respect,
as thus reported, is lawful and proper: it being understood, of course, that
thus the acts of alleged selection, possession, and occupation are performed
in perfect good faith.
</p><p>
Something is hinted, in the report of the commissioner,
as to the speculation-character of the proposed town settlement,&mdash;and, in
the official brief accompanying your letter, as to the speculation-character
of the proposed agricultural preemption. I suppose it must be so, if the
land in question has peculiar aptitude for municipal uses. But how is that
material? The
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0225" n="214"/>
object, in either mode of attaining it, is a lawful one. Two
persons may lawfully preempt a certain quantity of land under the general
law, and <hi rend="italic">intend</hi> a townsite without saying so; or they may preempt
<hi rend="italic">avowedly</hi> for a town site. As between the two courses, both having
the same ultimate destination, it would not seem that there could be any
cause of objection to the more explicit one.
</p><p>
So much for the first branch of the second question. As
to the second branch of it, the same line of reasoning leads to equally
satisfactory results.
</p><p>
The municipal preemptor, like the agricultural preemptor,
is required to take his land in conformity with "the legal subdivisions of
the public lands." I apprehend the import of the requirement is the same
in both cases. Neither class of pre-emptors is to break the legal subdivisions
as surveyed. The preemptor of either case may take fractional sections if
he will, but he is in every case to run his extreme lines with the lines
of the surveyed subdivisions. In fine, as it seems to me, there is nothing
of the present case, in so far as appears by the questions presented, and
the official reports and statement by which they are explained, except a
convict of claim to two or three sectional subdivisions of land between different
sets of preemptors, one set being avowed municipal preemptors, and the other
professed agricultural preemptors, but both sets having in reality the same
ulterior purposes in regard to the use of the land. The Government has no
possible concern in the controversy, except to deal impartially between the
parties according to law. The agricultural preemptors contend that different
rules of right as to the power of individual or private occupation, and as
to the <hi rend="italic">criteria</hi> of valid occupation, apply to them, as against their
adversaries. The municipal preemptors contend that the same rules of equal
right, inceptive and progressive, in these respects, apply to both classes
of preemptors. I think that the latter view of the law is correct, according
to its letter, its spirit; and the settled practice of the Government.
</p><p>
    <pb entity="DSSR_000002532_0226" n="215"/>
The investigation of the facts of the case, and the application
of the law to the facts, are, of course, duties of your Department.
