                <head>DAVID GRAHAM PHILLIPS <lb/> A TRIBUTE</head>


                <p>Even now I cannot realize that he is dead, and often in the city
                    streets&mdash;on Fifth Avenue in particular&mdash;I find myself glancing
                    ahead for a glimpse of the tall, boyish, familiar figure&mdash;experience
                    once again a flash of the old happy expectancy. </p>
                <p>I have lived in many lands, and have known men. I never knew a finer man than
                    Graham Phillips. </p>
                <p>His were the clearest, bluest, most honest eyes I ever saw&mdash;eyes that
                    scorned untruth&mdash;eyes that penetrated all sham. </p>
                <p>In repose his handsome features were a trifle stern&mdash;and the magic of
                    his smile was the more wonderful&mdash;such a sunny, youthful, engaging
                    smile. </p>
                <p>His mere presence in a room was exhilarating. It seemed to freshen the very air
                    with a keen sweetness almost pungent. </p>
                <p>He was tall, spare, leisurely, iron-strong; yet figure, features and bearing were
                    delightfully boyish. </p>
                <p>Men liked him, women liked him when he liked them. </p>
                <p>He was the most honest man I ever knew, clean in mind, clean-cut in body, a
                    little over-serious perhaps, except when among intimates; a little prone to
                    hoist the burdens of the world on his young shoulders. </p>
                <p>His was a knightly mind; a paladin character. But <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0017" n="vi"/> he could unbend, and the memory of
                    such hours with him&mdash;hours that can never be again&mdash;hurts more
                    keenly than the memory of calmer and more sober moments. </p>
                <p>We agreed in many matters, he and I; in many we differed. To me it was a greater
                    honor to differ in opinion with such a man than to find an entire synod of my
                    own mind. </p>
                <p>Because&mdash;and of course this is the opinion of one man and worth no more
                    than that&mdash;I have always thought that Graham Phillips was head and
                    shoulders above us all in his profession. </p>
                <p>He was to have been really great. He is&mdash;by his last book, "Susan
                    Lenox." </p>
                <p>Not that, when he sometimes discussed the writing of it with me, I was in
                    sympathy with it. I was not. We always were truthful to each other. </p>
                <p>But when a giant molds a lump of clay into tremendous masses, lesser men become
                    confused by the huge contours, the vast distances, the terrific spaces, the
                    majestic scope of the ensemble. So I. But he went on about his business. </p>
                <p>I do not know what the public may think of "Susan Lenox." I scarcely know what I
                    think. </p>
                <p>It is a terrible book&mdash;terrible and true and beautiful. </p>
                <p>Under the depths there are unspeakable things that writhe. His plumb-line touches
                    them and they squirm. He bends his head from the clouds to do it. Is it worth
                    doing? I don't know. </p>
                <p>But this I do know&mdash;that within the range of all fiction of all lands
                    and of all times no character has so overwhelmed me as the character of <hi
                        rend="italic">Susan Lenox.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0018" n="vii"/>

                <p>She is as real as life and as unreal. She is Life. Hers was the concentrated
                    nobility of Heaven and Hell. And the divinity of the one and the tragedy of the
                    other. For she had known both&mdash;this girl&mdash;the most pathetic,
                    the most human, the most honest character ever drawn by an American writer. </p>
                <p>In the presence of his last work, so overwhelming, so stupendous, we lesser men
                    are left at a loss. Its magnitude demands the perspective that time only can
                    lend it. Its dignity and austerity and its pitiless truth impose upon us that
                    honest and intelligent silence which even the quickest minds concede is
                    necessary before an honest verdict. </p>
                <p>Truth was his goddess; he wrought honestly and only for her. </p>
                <p>He is dead, but he is to have his day in court. And whatever the verdict, if it
                    be a true one, were he living he would rest content. </p>

                <head>BEFORE THE CURTAIN</head>
                <p> A few years ago, as to the most important and most interesting subject in the
                    world, the relations of the sexes, an author had to choose between silence and
                    telling those distorted truths beside which plain lying seems almost white and
                    quite harmless. And as no author could afford to be silent on the subject that
                    underlies all subjects, our literature, in so far as it attempted to deal with
                    the most vital phases of human nature, was beneath contempt. The authors who
                    knew they were lying sank almost as low as the nasty-nice purveyors of fake
                    idealism and candied pruriency who fancied they were writing the truth. Now it
                    almost seems that the day of lying conscious and unconscious is about run. "And
                    ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." </p>
                <p>There are three ways of dealing with the sex relations of men and
                    women&mdash;two wrong and one right. </p>
                <p>For lack of more accurate names the two wrong ways may be called respectively the
                    Anglo-Saxon and the Continental. Both are in essence processes of spicing up and
                    coloring up perfectly innocuous facts of nature to make them poisonously
                    attractive to perverted palates. The wishy-washy literature and the wishy-washy
                    morality on which it is based are not one stage more&mdash;or
                    less&mdash;rotten than the libertine literature and the libertine morality
                    on which it is based. So far as degrading effect is concerned, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0021" n="x"/> the "pure, sweet" story or play, false
                    to nature, false to true morality, propagandist of indecent emotions disguised
                    as idealism, need yield nothing to the so-called "strong" story. Both pander to
                    different forms of the same diseased craving for the unnatural. Both produce
                    moral atrophy. The one tends to encourage the shallow and unthinking in
                    ignorance of life and so causes them to suffer the merciless penalties of
                    ignorance. The other tends to miseducate the shallow and unthinking, to give
                    them a ruinously false notion of the delights of vice. The Anglo-Saxon
                    "morality" is like a nude figure salaciously draped; the Continental "strength"
                    is like a nude figure salaciously distorted. The Anglo-Saxon article reeks the
                    stench of disinfectants; the Continental reeks the stench of degenerate perfume.
                    The Continental shouts "Hypocrisy!" at the Anglo-Saxon; the Anglo-Saxon shouts
                    "Filthiness!" at the Continental. Both are right; they are twin sisters of the
                    same horrid mother. And an author of either allegiance has to have many a
                    redeeming grace of style, of character drawing, of philosophy, to gain him
                    tolerance in a clean mind. </p>
                <p>There is the third and right way of dealing with the sex relations of men and
                    women. That is the way of simple candor and naturalness. Treat the sex question
                    as you would any other question. Don't treat it reverently; don't treat it
                    rakishly. Treat it naturally. Don't insult your intelligence and lower your
                    moral tone by thinking about either the decency or the indecency of matters that
                    are familiar, undeniable, and unchangeable facts of life. Don't look on woman as
                    mere female, but as human being. Remember that she has a mind and a heart as
                    well as a body. <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0022"/> In a sentence, don't join in
                    the prurient clamor of "purity" hypocrites and "strong" libertines that
                    exaggerates and distorts the most commonplace, if the most important feature of
                    life. Let us try to be as sensible about sex as we are trying to be about all
                    the other phenomena of the universe in this more enlightened day. </p>
                <p>Nothing so sweetens a sin or so delights a sinner as getting big-eyed about it
                    and him. Those of us who are naughty aren't nearly so naughty as we like to
                    think; nor are those of us who are nice nearly so nice. Our virtues and our
                    failings are&mdash;perhaps to an unsuspected degree&mdash;the result of
                    the circumstances in which we are placed. The way to improve individuals is to
                    improve these circumstances; and the way to start at improving the circumstances
                    is by looking honestly and fearlessly at things as they are. We must know our
                    world and ourselves before we can know what should be kept and what changed. And
                    the beginning of this wisdom is in seeing sex relations rationally. Until that
                    fundamental matter is brought under the sway of good common sense, improvement
                    in other directions will be slow indeed. Let us stop lying&mdash;to
                    others&mdash;to ourselves. </p>

                <p>THE child's dead," said Nora, the nurse. It was the upstairs sitting-room in one
                    of the pretentious houses of Sutherland, oldest and most charming of the towns
                    on the Indiana bank of the Ohio. The two big windows were open; their limp and
                    listless draperies showed that there was not the least motion in the stifling
                    humid air of the July afternoon. At the center of the room stood an oblong
                    table; over it were neatly spread several thicknesses of white cotton cloth;
                    naked upon them lay the body of a newborn girl baby. At one side of the table
                    nearer the window stood Nora. Hers were the hard features and corrugated skin
                    popularly regarded as the result of a life of toil, but in fact the result of a
                    life of defiance to the laws of health. As additional penalties for that same
                    self-indulgence she had an enormous bust and hips, thin face and arms, hollow,
                    sinew-striped neck. The young man, blond and smooth faced, at the other side of
                    the table and facing the light, was Doctor Stevens, a recently graduated pupil
                    of the famous Schulze of Saint Christopher who as much as any other one man is
                    responsible for the rejection of hocus-pocus and the injection of common sense
                    into American medicine. For upwards of an hour young Stevens, coat <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0025" n="2"/> off and shirt sleeves rolled to his
                    shoulders, had been toiling with the lifeless form on the table. He had tried
                    everything his training, his reading and his experience suggested&mdash;all
                    the more or less familiar devices similar to those indicated for cases of
                    drowning. Nora had watched him, at first with interest and hope, then with
                    interest alone, finally with swiftly deepening disapproval, as her compressed
                    lips and angry eyes plainly revealed. It seemed to her his effort was
                    degenerating into sacrilege, into defiance of an obvious decree of the Almighty.
                    However, she had not ventured to speak until the young man, with a muttered
                    ejaculation suspiciously like an imprecation, straightened his stocky figure and
                    began to mop the sweat from his face, hands and bared arms. </p>
                <p>When she saw that her verdict had not been heard, she repeated it more
                    emphatically. "The child's dead," said she, "as I told you from the set-out."
                    She made the sign of the cross on her forehead and bosom, while her fat, dry
                    lips moved in a "Hail, Mary." </p>
                <p>The young man did not rouse from his reverie. He continued to gaze with a baffled
                    expression at the tiny form, so like a whimsical caricature of humanity. He
                    showed that he had heard the woman's remark by saying, to himself rather than to
                    her, "Dead? What's that? Merely another name for ignorance." But the current of
                    his thought did not swerve. It held to the one course: What would his master,
                    the dauntless, the infinitely resourceful Schulze, do if he were confronted by
                    this intolerable obstacle of a perfect machine refusing to do its duty and pump
                    vital force through an eagerly waiting body? "He'd _make_ it go, I'd bet my
                    life," the young man muttered. "I'm ashamed of myself." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0026" n="3"/>
                <p>As if the reproach were just the spur his courage and his intelligence had
                    needed, his face suddenly glowed with the upshooting fire of an inspiration. He
                    thrust the big white handkerchief into his hip pocket, laid one large strong
                    hand upon the small, beautifully arched chest of the baby. Nora, roused by his
                    expression even more than by his gesture, gave an exclamation of horror. "Don't
                    touch it again," she cried, between entreaty and command. "You've done all you
                    can&mdash;and more." </p>
                <p>Stevens was not listening. "Such a fine baby, too," he said,
                    hesitating&mdash;the old woman mistakenly fancied it was her words that made
                    him pause. "I feel no good at all," he went on, as if reasoning with himself,
                    "no good at all, losing both the mother and the child." </p>
                <p>"_She_ didn't want to live," replied Nora. Her glances stole somewhat fearfully
                    toward the door of the adjoining room&mdash;the bedroom where the mother lay
                    dead. </p>
                <p>"There wasn't nothing but disgrace ahead for both of them. Everybody'll be glad." </p>
                <p>"Such a fine baby," muttered the abstracted young doctor. </p>
                <p>"Love-children always is," said Nora. She was looking sadly and tenderly down at
                    the tiny, symmetrical form&mdash;symmetrical to her and the doctor's expert
                    eyes. "Such a deep chest," she sighed. "Such pretty hands and feet. A real
                    love-child." There she glanced nervously at the doctor; it was meet and proper
                    and pious to speak well of the dead, but she felt she might be going rather far
                    for a "good woman." </p>
                <p>"I'll try it," cried the young man in a resolute tone. "It can't do any harm,
                    and&mdash;" </p>
                <p>Without finishing his sentence he laid hold of the body by the ankles, swung it
                    clear of the table. As <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0027" n="4"/> Nora saw it
                    dangling head downwards like a dressed suckling pig on a butcher's hook she
                    vented a scream and darted round the table to stop by main force this revolting
                    desecration of the dead. Stevens called out sternly: "Mind your business, Nora!
                    Push the table against the wall and get out of the way. I want all the room
                    there is." </p>
                <p>"Oh, Doctor&mdash;for the blessed Jesus' sake&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Push back that table!" </p>
                <p>Nora shrank before his fierce eyes. She thought his exertions, his disappointment
                    and the heat had combined to topple him over into insanity. She retreated toward
                    the farther of the open windows. With a curse at her stupidity Stevens kicked
                    over the table, used his foot vigorously in thrusting it to the wall. "Now!"
                    exclaimed he, taking his stand in the center of the room and gauging the
                    distance of ceiling, floor and walls. </p>
                <p>Nora, her back against the window frame, her fingers sunk in her big loose bosom,
                    stared petrified. Stevens, like an athlete swinging an indian club, whirled the
                    body round and round his head, at the full length of his powerful arms. More and
                    more rapidly he swung it, until his breath came and went in gasps and the sweat
                    was trickling in streams down his face and neck. Round and round between ceiling
                    and floor whirled the naked body of the baby&mdash;round and round for
                    minutes that seemed hours to the horrified nurse&mdash;round and round with
                    all the strength and speed the young man could put forth&mdash;round and
                    round until the room was a blur before his throbbing eyes, until his expression
                    became fully as demoniac as Nora had been fancying it. Just as she was
                    recovering from her paralysis of horror and was about to fly shrieking <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0028" n="5"/> from the room she was halted by a sound
                    that made her draw in air until her bosom swelled as if it would burst its
                    gingham prison. She craned eagerly toward Stevens. He was whirling the body more
                    furiously than ever. </p>
                <p>"Was that you?" asked Nora hoarsely. "Or was it&mdash;" She paused, listened. </p>
                <p>The sound came again&mdash;the sound of a drowning person fighting for
                    breath. </p>
                <p>"It's&mdash;it's&mdash;" muttered Nora. "What is it, Doctor?" </p>
                <p>"Life!" panted Stevens, triumph in his glistening, streaming face. "Life!" </p>
                <p>He continued to whirl the little form, but not so rapidly or so vigorously. And
                    now the sound was louder, or, rather, less faint, less uncertain&mdash;was a
                    cry&mdash;was the cry of a living thing. "She's alive&mdash;alive!"
                    shrieked the woman, and in time with his movements she swayed to and fro from
                    side to side, laughing, weeping, wringing her hands, patting her bosom, her
                    cheeks. She stretched out her arms. "My prayers are answered!" she cried. "Don't
                    kill her, you brute! Give her to me. You shan't treat a baby that way." </p>
                <p>The unheeding doctor kept on whirling until the cry was continuous, a low but
                    lusty wail of angry protest. Then he stopped, caught the baby up in both arms,
                    burst out laughing. "You little minx!" he said&mdash;or, rather,
                    gasped&mdash;a tenderness quite maternal in his eyes. "But I got you! Nora,
                    the table." </p>
                <p>Nora righted the table, spread and smoothed the cloths, extended her scrawny
                    eager arms for the baby. Stevens with a jerk of the head motioned her aside,
                    laid the baby on the table. He felt for the pulse at its wrist, bent to listen
                    at the heart. Quite useless. <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0029" n="6"/> That
                    strong, rising howl of helpless fury was proof enough. Her majesty the baby was
                    mad through and through&mdash;therefore alive through and through. </p>
                <p>"Grand heart action!" said the young man. He stood aloof, hands on his hips, head
                    at a proud angle. "You never saw a healthier specimen. It'll be many a year, bar
                    accidents, before she's that near death again." </p>
                <p>But it was Nora's turn not to hear. She was soothing and swaddling the outraged
                    baby. "There&mdash;there!" she crooned. "Nora'll take care of you. The bad
                    man shan't come near my little precious&mdash;no, the wicked man shan't
                    touch her again." </p>
                <p>The bedroom door opened. At the slight noise superstitious Nora paled, shriveled
                    within her green and white checked gingham. She slowly turned her head as if on
                    this day of miracles she expected yet another&mdash;the resurrection of the
                    resurrected baby's mother, "poor Miss Lorella." But Lorella Lenox was forever
                    tranquil in the sleep that engulfed her and the sorrows in which she had been
                    entangled by an impetuous, trusting heart. The apparition in the doorway was
                    commonplace&mdash;the mistress of the house, Lorella's elder and married
                    sister Fanny&mdash;neither fair nor dark, neither tall nor short, neither
                    thin nor fat, neither pretty nor homely, neither stupid nor bright, neither neat
                    nor dowdy&mdash;one of that multitude of excellent, unobtrusive human beings
                    who make the restful stretches in a world of agitations&mdash;and who
                    respond to the impetus of circumstance as unresistingly as cloud to wind. </p>
                <p>As the wail of the child smote upon Fanny's ears she lifted her head, startled,
                    and cried out sharply, "What's that?" </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0030" n="7"/>

                <p>"We've saved the baby, Mrs. Warham," replied the young doctor, beaming on her
                    through his glasses. </p>
                <p>"Oh!" said Mrs. Warham. And she abruptly seated herself on the big chintz-covered
                    sofa beside the door. </p>
                <p>"And it's a lovely child," pleaded Nora. Her woman's instinct guided her straight
                    to the secret of the conflict raging behind Mrs. Warham's unhappy face. </p>
                <p>"The finest girl in the world," cried Stevens, well-meaning but tactless. </p>
                <p>"Girl!" exclaimed Fanny, starting up from the sofa. "Is it a _girl_?" </p>
                <p>Nora nodded. The young man looked downcast; he was realizing the practical side
                    of his victory for science&mdash;the consequences to the girl child, to all
                    the relatives. </p>
                <p>"A girl!" moaned Fanny, sinking to the sofa again. "God have mercy on us!" </p>
                <p>Louder and angrier rose the wail. Fanny, after a brief struggle with herself,
                    hurried to the table, looked down at the tiny helplessness. Her face softened.
                    She had been a mother four times. Only one had lived&mdash;her fair little
                    two-year-old Ruth&mdash;and she would never have any more children. The
                    tears glistened in her eyes. "What ails you, Nora Mulvey?" she demanded. "Why
                    aren't you 'tending to this poor little creature?" </p>
                <p>Nora sprang into action, but she wrapped the baby herself. The doctor in deep
                    embarrassment withdrew to the farther window. She fussed over the baby
                    lingeringly, but finally resigned it to the nurse. "Take it into the bathroom,"
                    she said, "where everything's ready to feed it&mdash;though I never
                    dreamed&mdash;" As Nora was about to depart, she detained her. "Let me look
                    at it again." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0031" n="8"/>

                <p>The nurse understood that Fanny Warham was searching for evidence of the
                    mysterious but suspected paternity whose secret Lorella, with true Lenox
                    obstinacy, had guarded to the end. The two women scanned the features. A man
                    would at a glance have abandoned hope of discovering anything from a chart so
                    vague and confused as that wrinkled, twisted, swollen face of the newborn. Not
                    so a woman. Said Nora: "She seems to me to favor the Lenoxes. But I
                    think&mdash;I _kind_ o' think&mdash;I see a _trace_
                    of&mdash;of&mdash;" There she halted, waiting for encouragement. </p>
                <p>"Of Galt?" suggested Fanny, in an undertone. </p>
                <p>"Of Galt," assented Nora, her tone equally discreet. "That nose is Galt-like and
                    the set of the ears&mdash;and a kind of something to the neck and
                    shoulders." </p>
                <p>"Maybe so," said Fanny doubtfully. She shook her head drearily, sighed. "What's
                    the use? Lorella's gone. And this morning General Galt came down to see my
                    husband with a letter he'd got from Jimmie. Jimmie denies it. Perhaps so. Again,
                    perhaps the General wrote him to write that, and threatened him if he didn't.
                    But what's the use? We'll never know." </p>
                <p>And they never did. </p>
                <p>When young Stevens was leaving, George Warham waylaid him at the front gate,
                    separated from the spacious old creeper-clad house by long lawns and an avenue
                    of elms. "I hear the child's going to live," said he anxiously. </p>
                <p>"I've never seen anything more alive," replied Stevens. </p>
                <p>Warham stared gloomily at the ground. He was evidently ashamed of his feelings,
                    yet convinced that they were human and natural. A moment's silence between the
                    men, then Stevens put his hand on the gate <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0032"
                        n="9"/> latch. "Did&mdash;did&mdash;my wife&mdash;" began
                    Warham. "Did she say what she calculated to do?" </p>
                <p>"Not a word, George." After a silence. "You know how fond she is of babies." </p>
                <p>"Yes, I know," replied Warham. "Fanny is a true woman if ever there was one."
                    With a certain defiance, "And Lorella&mdash;she was a sweet, womanly girl!" </p>
                <p>"As sweet and good as she was pretty," replied Stevens heartily. </p>
                <p>"The way she kept her mouth shut about that hound, whoever he is!" Warham's Roman
                    face grew savage, revealed in startling apparition a stubborn cruelty of which
                    there was not a trace upon the surface. "If I ever catch the&mdash;
                    &mdash;I'll fill him full of holes." </p>
                <p>"He'd be lynched&mdash;_whoever_ he is," said Stevens. </p>
                <p>"That's right!" cried Warham. "This is the North, but it's near enough to
                    Kentucky to know what to do with a wretch of that sort." His face became calmer.
                    "That poor little baby! He'll have a hard row to hoe." </p>
                <p>Stevens flushed a guilty red. "It's&mdash;it's&mdash;a girl," he
                    stammered. </p>
                <p>Warham stared. "A _girl_!" he cried. Then his face reddened and in a furious tone
                    he burst out: "Now don't that beat the devil for luck!. . . A girl! Good
                    Lord&mdash;a girl!" </p>
                <p>"Nobody in this town'll blame her," consoled Stevens. </p>
                <p>"You know better than that, Bob! A girl! Why, it's downright wicked. . . I wonder
                    what Fanny allows to do?" He showed what fear was in his mind by wheeling
                    savagely on Stevens with a stormy, "We can't keep her&mdash;we simply
                    can't!" </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0033" n="10"/>
                <p>"What's to become of her?" protested Stevens gently. </p>
                <p>Warham made a wild vague gesture with both arms. "Damn if I know! I've got to
                    look out for my own daughter. I won't have it. Damn it, I won't have it!"
                    Stevens lifted the gate latch. "Well&mdash; </p>
                <p>"Good-by, George. I'll look in again this evening." And knowing the moral ideas
                    of the town, all he could muster by way of encouragement was a half-hearted
                    "Don't borrow trouble." </p>
                <p>But Warham did not hear. He was moving up the tanbark walk toward the house,
                    muttering to himself. When Fanny, unable longer to conceal Lorella's plight, had
                    told him, pity and affection for his sweet sister-in-law who had made her home
                    with them for five years had triumphed over his principles. He had himself
                    arranged for Fanny to hide Lorella in New York until she could safely return.
                    But just as the sisters were about to set out, Lorella, low in body and in mind,
                    fell ill. Then George&mdash;and Fanny, too&mdash;had striven with her to
                    give them the name of her betrayer, that he might be compelled to do her
                    justice. Lorella refused. "I told him," she said, "and he&mdash;I never want
                    to see him again." They pleaded the disgrace to them, but she replied that he
                    would not marry her even if she would marry him; and she held to her refusal
                    with the firmness for which the Lenoxes were famous. They suspected Jimmie Galt,
                    because he had been about the most attentive of the young men until two or three
                    months before, and because he had abruptly departed for Europe to study
                    architecture. Lorella denied that it was he. "If you kill him," she said to
                    Warham, "you kill an innocent man." Warham was so exasperated by her obstinacy
                    that he was <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0034" n="11"/> at first for taking her at
                    her offer and letting her go away. But Fanny would not hear of it, and he
                    acquiesced. Now&mdash;"This child must be sent away off somewhere, and never
                    be heard of again," he said to himself. "If it'd been a boy, perhaps it might
                    have got along. But a girl&mdash; </p>
                <p>"There's nothing can be done to make things right for a girl that's got no father
                    and no name." </p>
                <p>The subject did not come up between him and his wife until about a week after
                    Lorella's funeral. But he was thinking of nothing else. At his big grocery
                    store&mdash;wholesale and retail&mdash;he sat morosely in his office,
                    brooding over the disgrace and the danger of deeper disgrace&mdash;for he
                    saw what a hold the baby already had upon his wife. He was ashamed to appear in
                    the streets; he knew what was going on behind the sympathetic faces, heard the
                    whisperings as if they had been trumpetings. And he was as much afraid of his
                    own soft heart as of his wife's. But for the sake of his daughter he must be
                    firm and just. </p>
                <p>One morning, as he was leaving the house after breakfast, he turned back and said
                    abruptly: "Fan, don't you think you'd better send the baby away and get it over
                    with?" </p>
                <p>"No," said his wife unhesitatingly&mdash;and he knew his worst suspicion was
                    correct. "I've made up my mind to keep her." </p>
                <p>"It isn't fair to Ruth." </p>
                <p>"Send it away&mdash;where?" </p>
                <p>"Anywhere. Get it adopted in Chicago&mdash;Cincinnati&mdash;Louisville." </p>
                <p>"Lorella's baby?" </p>
                <p>"When she and Ruth grow up&mdash;what then?" </p>
                <p>"People ain't so low as some think." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0035"/>
                <p>"`The sins of the parents are visited on the children unto&mdash;'" </p>
                <p>"I don't care," interrupted Fanny. "I love her. I'm going to keep her. Wait here
                    a minute." </p>
                <p>When she came back she had the baby in her arms. "Just look," she said softly. </p>
                <p>George frowned, tried not to look, but was soon drawn and held by the sweet,
                    fresh, blooming face, so smooth, so winning, so innocent. </p>
                <p>"And think how she was sent back to life&mdash;from beyond the grave. It must
                    have been for some purpose." </p>
                <p>Warham groaned, "Oh, Lord, I don't know _what_ to do! But&mdash;it ain't fair
                    to our Ruth." </p>
                <p>"I don't see it that way. . . . Kiss her, George." </p>
                <p>Warham kissed one of the soft cheeks, swelling like a ripening apple. The baby
                    opened wide a pair of wonderful dark eyes, threw up its chubby arms and
                    laughed&mdash;such a laugh!. . . There was no more talk of sending her away.</p>

                <head>II</head>
                <p> NOT quite seventeen years later, on a fine June morning, Ruth Warham issued
                    hastily from the house and started down the long tanbark walk from the front
                    veranda to the street gate. She was now nineteen&mdash;nearer
                    twenty&mdash;and a very pretty young woman, indeed. She had grown up one of
                    those small slender blondes, exquisite and doll-like, who cannot help seeming
                    fresh and sweet, whatever the truth about them, without or within. This morning
                    she had on a new summer dress of a blue that matched her eyes and harmonized
                    with her coloring. She was looking her best, and she had the satisfying,
                    confidence-giving sense that it was so. Like most of the unattached girls of
                    small towns, she was always dreaming of the handsome stranger who would fall in
                    love&mdash;the thrilling, love-story kind of love at first sight. The
                    weather plays a conspicuous part in the romancings of youth; she felt that this
                    was precisely the kind of day fate would be most likely to select for the
                    meeting. Just before dressing she had been reading about the wonderful
                    _him_&mdash;in Robert Chambers' latest story&mdash;and she had spent
                    full fifteen minutes of blissful reverie over the accompanying Fisher
                    illustration. Now she was issuing hopefully forth, as hopefully as if adventure
                    were the rule and order of life in Sutherland, instead of a desperate monotony
                    made the harder to bear by the glory of its scenery. </p>
                <p>She had got only far enough from the house to be <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0037"
                        n="14"/> visible to the second-story windows when a young voice called: </p>
                <p>"Ruthie! Aren't you going to wait for me?" </p>
                <p>Ruth halted; an expression anything but harmonious with the pretty blue costume
                    stormed across her face. "I won't have her along!" she muttered. "I simply
                    won't!" She turned slowly and, as she turned, effaced every trace of temper with
                    a dexterity which might have given an onlooker a poorer opinion of her character
                    than perhaps the facts as to human nature justify. The countenance she presently
                    revealed to those upper windows was sunny and sweet. No one was visible; but the
                    horizontal slats in one of the only closed pair of shutters and a vague
                    suggestion of movement rather than form behind them gave the impression that a
                    woman, not far enough dressed to risk being seen from the street, was hidden
                    there. Evidently Ruth knew, for it was toward this window that she directed her
                    gaze and the remark: "Can't wait, dear. I'm in a great hurry. Mamma wants the
                    silk right away and I've got to match it." </p>
                <p>"But I'll be only a minute," pleaded the voice&mdash;a much more interesting,
                    more musical voice than Ruth's rather shrill and thin high soprano. </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;I'll meet you up at papa's store." </p>
                <p>"All right." </p>
                <p>Ruth resumed her journey. She smiled to herself. "That means," said she, half
                    aloud, "I'll steer clear of the store this morning." </p>
                <p>But as she was leaving the gate into the wide, shady, sleepy street, who should
                    come driving past in a village cart but Lottie Wright! And Lottie reined her
                    pony in to the sidewalk and in the shade of a symmetrical walnut tree proceeded
                    to invite Ruth to a <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0038" n="15"/> dance&mdash;a
                    long story, as Lottie had to tell all about it, the decorations, the favors, the
                    food, who would be there, what she was going to wear, and so on and on. Ruth was
                    intensely interested but kept remembering something that caused her to glance
                    uneasily from time to time up the tanbark walk under the arching boughs toward
                    the house. Even if she had not been interested, she would hardly have ventured
                    to break off; Lottie Wright was the only daughter of the richest man in
                    Sutherland and, therefore, social arbiter to the younger set. </p>
                <p>Lottie stopped abruptly, said: "Well, I really must get on. And there's your
                    cousin coming down the walk. I know you've been waiting for her." </p>
                <p>Ruth tried to keep in countenance, but a blush of shame and a frown of irritation
                    came in spite of her. </p>
                <p>"I'm sorry I can't ask Susie, too," pursued Lottie, in a voice of hypocritical
                    regret. "But there are to be exactly eighteen couples&mdash;and I couldn't." </p>
                <p>"Of course not," said Ruth heartily. "Susan'll understand." </p>
                <p>"I wouldn't for the world do anything to hurt her feelings," continued Lottie
                    with the self-complacent righteousness of a deacon telling the congregation how
                    good "grace" has made him. Her prominent commonplace brown eyes were gazing up
                    the walk, an expression distressingly like envious anger in them. She had a
                    thick, pudgy face, an oily skin, an outcropping of dull red pimples on the chin.
                    Many women can indulge their passion for sweets at meals and sweets between
                    meals without serious injury&mdash;to complexion; Lottie Wright, unluckily,
                    couldn't. </p>
                <p>"I feel sorry for Susie," she went on, in the ludicrous patronizing tone that
                    needs no describing to anyone <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0039" n="16"/>
                    acquainted with any fashionable set anywhere from China to Peru. "And I think
                    the way you all treat her is simply beautiful. But, then, everybody feels sorry
                    for her and tries to be kind. She knows&mdash;about herself, I
                    mean&mdash;doesn't she, Ruthie?" </p>
                <p>"I guess so," replied Ruth, almost hanging her head in her mortification. "She's
                    very good and sweet." </p>
                <p>"Indeed, she is," said Lottie. "And father says she's far and away the prettiest
                    girl in town." </p>
                <p>With this parting shot, which struck precisely where she had aimed, Lottie
                    gathered up the reins and drove on, calling out a friendly "Hello, Susie
                    dearie," to Susan Lenox, who, on her purposely lagging way from the house, had
                    nearly reached the gate. </p>
                <p>"What a nasty thing Lottie Wright is!" exclaimed Ruth to her cousin. </p>
                <p>"She has a mean tongue," admitted Susan, tall and slim and straight, with
                    glorious dark hair and a skin healthily pallid and as smooth as clear. "But
                    she's got a good heart. She gives a lot away to poor people." </p>
                <p>"Because she likes to patronize and be kowtowed to," retorted Ruth. "She's mean,
                    I tell you." Then, with a vicious gleam in the blue eyes that hinted a deeper
                    and less presentable motive for the telling, she added: "Why, she's not going to
                    ask you to her party." </p>
                <p>Susan was obviously unmoved. "She has the right to ask whom she pleases.
                    And"&mdash;she laughed&mdash;"if I were giving a party I'd not want to
                    ask her&mdash;though I might do it for fear she'd feel left out." </p>
                <p>"Don't you feel&mdash;left out?" </p>
                <p>Susan shook her head. "I seem not to care much about going to parties lately. The
                    boys don't like <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0040" n="17"/> to dance with me, and
                    I get tired of sitting the dances out." </p>
                <p>This touched Ruth's impulsively generous heart and woman's easy tears filled her
                    eyes; her cousin's remark was so pathetic, the more pathetic because its pathos
                    was absolutely unconscious. Ruth shot a pitying glance at Susan, but the instant
                    she saw the loveliness of the features upon which that expression of
                    unconsciousness lay like innocence upon a bed of roses, the pity vanished from
                    her eyes to be replaced by a disfiguring envy as hateful as an evil emotion can
                    be at nineteen. Susan still lacked nearly a month of seventeen, but she seemed
                    older than Ruth because her mind and her body had developed beyond her
                    years&mdash;or, perhaps it would be more accurate to say beyond the average
                    of growth at seventeen. Also, her personality was stronger, far more definite.
                    Ruth tried to believe herself the cleverer and the more beautiful, at times with
                    a certain success. But as she happened to be a shrewd young person&mdash;an
                    inheritance from the Warhams&mdash;she was haunted by
                    misgivings&mdash;and worse. Those whose vanity never suffers from these
                    torments will, of course, condemn her; but whoever has known the pain of having
                    to concede superiority to someone with whom she or he&mdash;is constantly
                    contrasted will not be altogether without sympathy for Ruth in her struggles,
                    often vain struggles, against the mortal sin of jealousy. </p>
                <p>The truth is, Susan was beyond question the beauty of Sutherland. Her eyes, very
                    dark at birth, had changed to a soft, dreamy violet-gray. Hair and coloring,
                    lashes and eyebrows remained dark; thus her eyes and the intense red of her lips
                    had that vicinage of contrast which is necessary to distinction. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0041" n="18"/> To look at her was to be at once
                    fascinated by those violet-gray eyes&mdash;by their color, by their
                    clearness, by their regard of calm, grave inquiry, by their mystery not
                    untouched by a certain sadness. She had a thick abundance of wavy hair, not so
                    long as Ruth's golden braids, but growing beautifully instead of thinly about
                    her low brow, about her delicately modeled ears, and at the back of her
                    exquisite neck. Her slim nose departed enough from the classic line to prevent
                    the suggestion of monotony that is in all purely classic faces. Her nostrils had
                    the sensitiveness that more than any other outward sign indicates the
                    imaginative temperament. Her chin and throat&mdash;to look at them was to
                    know where her lover would choose to kiss her first. When she smiled her large
                    even teeth were dazzling. And the smile itself was exceedingly sweet and
                    winning, with the violet-gray eyes casting over it that seriousness verging on
                    sadness which is the natural outlook of a highly intelligent nature. For while
                    stupid vain people are suspicious and easily offended, only the intelligent are
                    truly sensitive&mdash;keenly susceptible to all sensations. The dull ear is
                    suspicious; the acute ear is sensitive. </p>
                <p>The intense red of her lips, at times so vivid that it seemed artificial, and
                    their sinuous, sensitive curve indicated a temperament that was frankly
                    proclaimed in her figure&mdash;sensuous, graceful, slender&mdash;the
                    figure of girlhood in its perfection and of perfect womanhood,
                    too&mdash;like those tropical flowers that look innocent and young and
                    fresh, yet stir in the beholder passionate longings and visions. Her walk was
                    worthy of face and figure&mdash;free and firm and graceful, the small head
                    carried proudly without haughtiness. </p>
                <p>This physical beauty had as an aureole to illuminate <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0042" n="19"/> it and to set it off a manner that was
                    wholly devoid of mannerisms&mdash;of those that men and women think out and
                    exhibit to give added charm to themselves&mdash;tricks of cuteness, as lisp
                    and baby stare; tricks of dignity, as grave brow and body always carried rigidly
                    erect; tricks of sweetness and kindliness, as the ever ready smile and the warm
                    handclasp. Susan, the interested in the world about her, Susan, the
                    self-unconscious, had none of these tricks. She was at all times her own self.
                    Beauty is anything but rare, likewise intelligence. But this quality of
                    naturalness is the greatest of all qualities. It made Susan Lenox unique. </p>
                <p>It was not strange&mdash;nor inexcusable that the girls and their parents had
                    begun to pity Susan as soon as this beauty developed and this personality had
                    begun to exhale its delicious perfume. It was but natural that they should start
                    the whole town to "being kind to the poor thing." And it was equally the matter
                    of course that they should have achieved their object&mdash;should have
                    impressed the conventional masculine mind of the town with such a sense of the
                    "poor thing's" social isolation and "impossibility" that the boys ceased to be
                    her eagerly admiring friends, were afraid to be alone with her, to ask her to
                    dance. Women are conventional as a business; but with men conventionality is a
                    groveling superstition. The youths of Sutherland longed for, sighed for the
                    alluring, sweet, bright Susan; but they dared not, with all the women saying
                    "Poor thing! What a pity a nice man can't afford to have anything to do with
                    her!" It was an interesting typical example of the profound snobbishness of the
                    male character. Rarely, after Susan was sixteen, did any of the boys venture to
                    ask her to dance <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0043" n="20"/> and so give himself
                    the joy of encircling that lovely form of hers; yet from babyhood her
                    fascination for the male sex, regardless of age or temperament, had been
                    uncanny&mdash;"naturally, she being a love-child," said the old women. And
                    from fourteen on, it grew steadily. </p>
                <p>It would be difficult for one who has not lived in a small town to understand
                    exactly the kind of isolation to which Sutherland consigned the girl without her
                    realizing it, without their fully realizing it themselves. Everyone was friendly
                    with her. A stranger would not have noticed any difference in the treatment of
                    her and of her cousin Ruth. Yet not one of the young men would have thought of
                    marrying her, would have regarded her as his equal or the equal of his sisters.
                    She went to all the general entertainments. She was invited to all the houses
                    when failure to invite her would have seemed pointed&mdash;but only then.
                    She did not think much about herself; she was fond of study&mdash;fonder of
                    reading&mdash;fondest, perhaps, of making dresses and hats, especially for
                    Ruth, whom she thought much prettier than herself. Thus, she was only vaguely,
                    subconsciously conscious of there being something peculiar and mysterious in her
                    lot. </p>
                <p>This isolation, rather than her dominant quality of self-effacing consideration
                    for others, was the chief cause of the extraordinary innocence of her mind. No
                    servant, no girl, no audacious boy ever ventured to raise with her any question
                    remotely touching on sex. All those questions seemed to Puritan Sutherland in
                    any circumstances highly indelicate; in relation to Susan they seemed worse than
                    indelicate, dreadful though the thought was that there could be anything worse
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0044" n="21"/> than indelicacy. At fifteen she
                    remained as unaware of even the existence of the mysteries of sex as she had
                    been at birth. Nothing definite enough to arouse her curiosity had ever been
                    said in her hearing; and such references to those matters as she found in her
                    reading passed her by, as any matter of which he has not the beginnings of
                    knowledge will fail to arrest the attention of any reader. It was generally
                    assumed that she knew all about her origin, that someone had, some time or
                    other, told her. Even her Aunt Fanny thought so, thought she was hiding the
                    knowledge deep in her heart, explained in that way her content with the solitude
                    of books and sewing. </p>
                <p>Susan was the worst possible influence in Ruth's life. Our character is ourself,
                    is born with us, clings to us as the flesh to our bones, persists unchanged
                    until we die. But upon the circumstances that surround us depends what part of
                    our character shall show itself. Ruth was born with perhaps something more than
                    the normal tendency to be envious and petty. But these qualities might never
                    have shown themselves conspicuously had there been no Susan for her to envy. The
                    very qualities that made Susan lovable reacted upon the pretty, pert blond
                    cousin to make her the more unlovable. Again and again, when she and Susan were
                    about to start out together, and Susan would appear in beauty and grace of
                    person and dress, Ruth would excuse herself, would fly to her room to lock
                    herself in and weep and rage and hate. And at the high school, when Susan scored
                    in a recitation or in some dramatic entertainment, Ruth would sit with bitten
                    lip and surging bosom, pale with jealousy. Susan's isolation, the way the boys
                    avoided having with her the friendly relations that <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0045" n="22"/> spring up naturally among young people
                    these gave Ruth a partial revenge. But Susan, seemingly unconscious, rising
                    sweetly and serenely above all pettiness&mdash; </p>
                <p>Ruth's hatred deepened, though she hid it from everyone, almost from herself. And
                    she depended more and more utterly upon Susan to select her clothes for her, to
                    dress her, to make her look well; for Susan had taste and Ruth had not. </p>
                <p>On that bright June morning as the cousins went up Main Street together, Susan
                    gave herself over to the delight of sun and air and of the flowering gardens
                    before the attractive houses they were passing; Ruth, with the day quite dark
                    for her, all its joys gone, was fighting against a hatred of her cousin so
                    vicious that it made her afraid. "I'll have no chance at all," her angry heart
                    was saying, "so long as Susie's around, keeping everybody reminded of the family
                    shame." And that was a truth she could not downface, mean and ungenerous though
                    thinking it might be. The worst of all was that Susan, in a simple white dress
                    and an almost untrimmed white straw hat with a graceful curve to its brim and
                    set at the right angle upon that wavy dark hair, was making the beauty of her
                    short blond cousin dim and somehow common. </p>
                <p>At the corner of Maple Street Ruth's self-control reached its limit. She halted,
                    took the sample of silk from her glove. There was not a hint of her feelings in
                    her countenance, for shame and the desire to seem to be better than she was were
                    fast making her an adept in hypocrisy. "You go ahead and match it for mamma,"
                    said she. "I've got to run in and see Bessie Andrews." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0046" n="23"/>
                <p>"But I promised Uncle George I'd come and help him with the monthly bills,"
                    objected Susan. </p>
                <p>"You can do both. It'll take you only a minute. If mother had known you were
                    going uptown, she'd never have trusted _me_." And Ruth had tucked the sample in
                    Susan's belt and was hurrying out Maple Street. There was nothing for Susan to
                    do but go on alone. </p>
                <p>Two squares, and she was passing the show place of Sutherland, the home of the
                    Wrights. She paused to regale herself with a glance into the grove of
                    magnificent elms with lawns and bright gardens beyond&mdash;for the Wright
                    place filled the entire square between Broad and Myrtle Streets and from Main to
                    Monroe. She was starting on when she saw among the trees a young man in striped
                    flannels. At the same instant he saw her. </p>
                <p>"Hel-_lo_, Susie!" he cried. "I was thinking about you." </p>
                <p>Susan halted. "When did you get back, Sam?" she asked. "I heard you were going to
                    stay on in the East all summer." </p>
                <p>After they had shaken hands across the hedge that came almost to their shoulders,
                    Susan began to move on. Sam kept pace with her on his side of the carefully
                    trimmed boxwood barrier. "I'm going back East in about two weeks," said he.
                    "It's awfully dull here after Yale. I just blew in&mdash;haven't seen Lottie
                    or father yet. Coming to Lottie's party?" </p>
                <p>"No," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"Why not?" </p>
                <p>Susan laughed merrily. "The best reason in the world. Lottie has only invited
                    just so many couples." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0047" n="24"/>
                <p>"I'll see about that," cried Sam. "You'll be asked all right, all right." </p>
                <p>"No," said Susan. She was one of those whose way of saying no gives its full
                    meaning and intent. "I'll not be asked, thank you&mdash;and I'll not go if I
                    am." </p>
                <p>By this time they were at the gate. He opened it, came out into the street. He
                    was a tallish, athletic youth, dark, and pleasing enough of feature to be called
                    handsome. He was dressed with a great deal of style of the efflorescent kind
                    called sophomoric. He was a Sophomore at Yale. But that was not so largely
                    responsible for his self-complacent expression as the deference he had got from
                    babyhood through being heir apparent to the Wright fortune. He had a
                    sophisticated way of inspecting Susan's charms of figure no less than charms of
                    face that might have made a disagreeable impression upon an experienced
                    onlooker. There is a time for feeling without knowing why one feels; and that
                    period ought not to have been passed for young Wright for many a year. </p>
                <p>"My, but you're looking fine, Susie!" exclaimed he. "I haven't seen anyone that
                    could hold a candle to you even in the East." </p>
                <p>Susan laughed and blushed with pleasure. "Go on," said she with raillery. "I love
                    it." </p>
                <p>"Come in and sit under the trees and I'll fill all the time you'll give me." </p>
                <p>This reminded her. "I must hurry uptown," she said. "Good-by." </p>
                <p>"Hold on!" cried he. "What have you got to do?" He happened to glance down the
                    street. "Isn't that Ruth coming?" </p>
                <p>"So it is," said Susan. "I guess Bessie Andrews wasn't at home." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0048" n="25"/>
                <p>Sam waved at Ruth and called, "Hello! Glad to see you." </p>
                <p>Ruth was all sweetness and smiles. She and her mother&mdash;quite privately
                    and with nothing openly said on either side&mdash;had canvassed Sam as a
                    "possibility." There had been keen disappointment at the news that he was not
                    coming home for the long vacation. "How are you, Sam?" said she, as they shook
                    hands. "My, Susie, _doesn't_ he look New York?" </p>
                <p>Sam tried to conceal that he was swelling with pride. "Oh, this is nothing," said
                    he deprecatingly. </p>
                <p>Ruth's heart was a-flutter. The Fisher picture of the Chambers love-maker,
                    thought she, might almost be a photograph of Sam. She was glad she had obeyed
                    the mysterious impulse to make a toilette of unusual elegance that morning. How
                    get rid of Susan? "_I_'ll take the sample, Susie," said she. "Then you won't
                    have to keep father waiting." </p>
                <p>Susie gave up the sample. Her face was no longer so bright and interested. </p>
                <p>"Oh, drop it," cried Sam. "Come in&mdash;both of you. I'll telephone for Joe
                    Andrews and we'll take a drive&mdash;or anything you like." He was looking
                    at Susan. </p>
                <p>"Can't do it," replied Susan. "I promised Uncle George." </p>
                <p>"Oh, bother!" urged Sam. "Telephone him. It'll be all right&mdash;won't it,
                    Ruth?" </p>
                <p>"You don't know Susie," said Ruth, with a queer, strained laugh. "She'd rather
                    die than break a promise." </p>
                <p>"I must go," Susan now said. "Good-by." </p>
                <p>"Come on, Ruth," cried Sam. "Let's walk uptown with her." </p>
                <p>"And you can help match the silk," said Ruth. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0049" n="26"/>
                <p>"Not for me," replied young Wright. Then to Susan, "What've _you_ got to do?
                    Maybe it's something I could help at." </p>
                <p>"No. It's for Uncle George and me." </p>
                <p>"Well, I'll go as far as the store. Then&mdash;we'll see." </p>
                <p>They were now in the business part of Main Street, were at Wilson's dry goods
                    store. "You might find it here," suggested the innocent Susan to her cousin. </p>
                <p>Ruth colored, veiled her eyes to hide their flash. "I've got to go to the store
                    first&mdash;to get some money," she hastily improvised. </p>
                <p>Sam had been walking between the two girls. He now changed to the outside and,
                    so, put himself next Susan alone, put Susan between him and Ruth. The maneuver
                    seemed to be a mere politeness, but Ruth knew better. What fate had intended as
                    her lucky day was being changed into unlucky by this cousin of hers. Ruth walked
                    sullenly along, hot tears in her eyes and a choke in her throat, as she listened
                    to Sam's flatterings of her cousin, and to Susan's laughing, delighted replies.
                    She tried to gather herself together, to think up something funny or at least
                    interesting with which to break into the _tete-a-tete_ and draw Sam to herself.
                    She could think nothing but envious, hateful thoughts. At the doors of Warham
                    and Company, wholesale and retail grocers, the three halted. </p>
                <p>"I guess I'll go to Vandermark's," said Ruth. "I really don't need money. Come
                    on, Sam." </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;I'm going back home. I ought to see Lottie and father. My, but it's
                    dull in this town!" </p>
                <p>"Well, so long," said Susan. She nodded, sparkling of hair and skin and eyes, and
                    went into the store. </p>
                <p>Sam and Ruth watched her as she walked down the broad aisle between the counters.
                    From the store came <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0050" n="27"/> a mingling of
                    odors of fruit, of spices, of freshly ground coffee. "Susan's an awful pretty
                    girl, isn't she?" declared Sam with rude enthusiasm. </p>
                <p>"Indeed she is," replied Ruth as heartily&mdash;and with an honest if
                    discouraged effort to feel enthusiastic. </p>
                <p>"What a figure! And she has such a good walk. Most women walk horribly." </p>
                <p>"Come on to Vandermark's with me and I'll stroll back with you," offered Ruth.
                    Sam was still gazing into the store where, far to the rear, Susan could be seen;
                    the graceful head, the gently swelling bust, the soft lines of the white dress,
                    the pretty ankles revealed by the short skirt&mdash;there was, indeed, a
                    profile worth a man's looking at on a fine June day. Ruth's eyes were upon Sam,
                    handsome, dressed in the Eastern fashion, an ideal lover. "Come on, Sam," urged
                    Ruth. </p>
                <p>"No, thanks," he replied absently. "I'll go back. Good luck!" And not glancing at
                    her, he lifted his straw hat with its band of Yale blue and set out. </p>
                <p>Ruth moved slowly and disconsolately in the opposite direction. She was ashamed
                    of her thoughts; but shame never yet withheld anybody from being human in
                    thought. As she turned to enter Vandermark's she glanced down the street. There
                    was Sam, returned and going into her father's store. She hesitated, could devise
                    no plan of action, hurried into the dry goods store. Sinclair, the head salesman
                    and the beau of Sutherland, was an especial friend of hers. The tall, slender,
                    hungry-looking young man, devoured with ambition for speedy wealth, had no mind
                    to neglect so easy an aid to that ambition as nature gave him in making him a
                    lady-charmer. He had resolved to marry either Lottie Wright or Ruth
                    Warham&mdash;Ruth preferred, because, while Lottie would have many times <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0051" n="28"/> more money, her skin made her a stiff
                    dose for a young man brought up to the American tradition that the face is the
                    woman. But that morning Sinclair exerted his charms in vain. Ruth was in a
                    hurry, was distinctly rude, cut short what in other circumstances would have
                    been a prolonged and delightful flirtation by tossing the sample on the counter
                    and asking him to do the matching for her and to send the silk right away. Which
                    said, she fairly bolted from the store. </p>
                <p>She arrived barely in time. Young Wright was issuing from Warham and Company. He
                    smiled friendly enough, but Ruth knew where his thoughts were. "Get what you
                    wanted?" inquired he, and went on to explain: "I came back to find out if you
                    and Susie were to be at home this evening. Thought I'd call." </p>
                <p>Ruth paled with angry dismay. She was going to a party at the
                    Sinclairs'&mdash;one to which Susan was not invited. "Aren't you going to
                    Sinclairs'?" said she. </p>
                <p>"I was. But I thought I'd rather call. Perhaps I'll go there later." </p>
                <p>He was coming to call on Susan! All the way down Main Street to the Wright place
                    Ruth fought against her mood of angry and depressed silence, tried to make the
                    best of her chance to impress Sam. But Sam was absent and humiliatingly near to
                    curt. He halted at his father's gate. She halted also, searched the grounds with
                    anxious eyes for sign of Lottie that would give her the excuse for entering. </p>
                <p>"So long," said Sam. </p>
                <p>"Do come to Sinclairs' early. You always did dance so well." </p>
                <p>"Oh, dancing bores me," said the blase Sophomore. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0052" n="29"/> "But I'll be round before the shindy's
                    over. I've got to take Lot home." </p>
                <p>He lifted the hat again with what both he and Ruth regarded as a gesture of most
                    elegant carelessness. Ruth strolled reluctantly on, feeling as if her toilet had
                    been splashed or crushed. As she entered the front door her mother, in a wrapper
                    and curl papers, appeared at the head of the stairs. "Why!" cried she. "Where's
                    the silk? It's for your dress tonight, you know." </p>
                <p>"It'll be along," was Ruth's answer, her tone dreary, her lip quivering. "I met
                    Sam Wright." </p>
                <p>"Oh!" exclaimed her mother. "He's back, is he?" </p>
                <p>Ruth did not reply. She came on up the stairs, went into the
                    sitting-room&mdash;the room where Doctor Stevens seventeen years before had
                    torn the baby Susan from the very claws of death. She flung herself down, buried
                    her head in her arms upon that same table. She burst into a storm of tears. </p>
                <p>"Why, dearie dear," cried her mother, "whatever is the matter?" </p>
                <p>"It's wicked and hateful," sobbed the girl, "but&mdash;Oh, mamma, I _hate_
                    Susan! She was along, and Sam hardly noticed me, and he's coming here this
                    evening to call." </p>
                <p>"But you'll be at Sinclairs'!" exclaimed Mrs. Warham. </p>
                <p>"Not Susan," sobbed Ruth. "He wants to see only her." </p>
                <p>The members of the Second Presbyterian Church, of which Fanny Warham was about
                    the most exemplary and assiduous female member, would hardly have recognized the
                    face encircled by that triple row of curl-papered locks, shinily plastered with
                    quince-seed liquor. <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0053"/> She was at woman's second
                    critical age, and the strange emotions working in her mind&mdash;of whose
                    disorder no one had an inkling&mdash;were upon the surface now. She ventured
                    this freedom of facial expression because her daughter's face was hid. She did
                    not speak. She laid a tender defending hand for an instant upon her daughter's
                    shoulder&mdash;like the caress of love and encouragement the lioness gives
                    her cub as she is about to give battle for it. Then she left the room. She did
                    not know what to do, but she knew she must and would do something. </p>

                <head>III</head>
                <p> THE telephone was downstairs, in the rear end of the hall which divided the
                    lower floor into two equal parts. But hardly had Mrs. Warham given the
                    Sinclairs' number to the exchange girl when Ruth called from the head of the
                    stairs: </p>
                <p>"What're you doing there, mamma?" </p>
                <p>"I'll tell Mrs. Sinclair you're sick and can't come. Then I'll send Susan in your
                    place." </p>
                <p>"Don't!" cried Ruth, in an agitated, angry voice. "Ring off&mdash;quick!" </p>
                <p>"Now, Ruth, let me&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Ring off!" ordered Ruth. "You mustn't do that. You'll have the whole town
                    talking about how I'm throwing myself at Sam's head&mdash;and that I'm
                    jealous of Susan." </p>
                <p>Mrs. Warham said, "Never mind" into the telephone sender and hung up the
                    receiver. She was frightened, but not convinced. Hers was a slow, old-fashioned
                    mind, and to it the scheme it had worked out seemed a model of skillful
                    duplicity. But Ruth, of the younger and subtler generation, realized instantly
                    how transparent the thing was. Mrs. Warham was abashed but not angered by her
                    daughter's curt contempt. </p>
                <p>"It's the only way I can think of," said she. "And I still don't see&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Of course you don't," cut in Ruth, ruffled by the perilously narrow escape from
                    being the laughing stock of the town. "People aren't as big fools as they <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0055" n="32"/> used to be, mamma. They don't believe
                    nowadays everything that's told them. There isn't anybody that doesn't know I'm
                    never sick. No&mdash;we'll have to&mdash;" </p>
                <p>She reflected a moment, pausing halfway down the stairs, while her mother watched
                    her swollen and tear-stained face. </p>
                <p>"We might send Susan away for the evening," suggested the mother. </p>
                <p>"Yes," assented the daughter. "Papa could take her with him for a drive to North
                    Sutherland&mdash;to see the Provosts. Then Sam'd come straight on to the
                    Sinclairs'." </p>
                <p>"I'll call up your father." </p>
                <p>"No!" cried Ruth, stamping her foot. "Call up Mr. Provost, and tell him papa's
                    coming. Then you can talk with papa when he gets home to dinner." </p>
                <p>"But maybe&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"If that doesn't work out we can do something else this afternoon." </p>
                <p>The mother and the daughter avoided each other's eyes. Both felt mean and small,
                    guilty toward Susan; but neither was for that reason disposed to draw back. As
                    Mrs. Warham was trying the new dress on her daughter, she said: </p>
                <p>"Anyhow, Sam'd be wasting time on Susan. He'd hang round her for no good. She'd
                    simply get talked about. The poor child can't be lively or smile but what people
                    begin to wonder if she's going the way of&mdash;of Lorella." </p>
                <p>"That's so," agreed Ruth, and both felt better. "Was Aunt Lorella _very_ pretty,
                    mamma?" </p>
                <p>"Lovely!" replied Fanny, and her eyes grew tender, for she had adored Lorella.
                    "You never saw such a complexion&mdash;like Susan's, only snow-white." <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0056" n="33"/> Nervously and hastily, "Most as fine
                    as yours, Ruthie." </p>
                <p>Ruth gazed complacently into the mirror. "I'm glad I'm fair, and not big," said
                    she. </p>
                <p>"Yes, indeed! I like the womanly woman. And so do men." </p>
                <p>"Don't you think we ought to send Susan away to visit somewhere?" asked Ruth at
                    the next opportunity for talk the fitting gave. "It's getting more and
                    more&mdash;pointed&mdash;the way people act. And she's so sweet and
                    good, I'd hate to have her feelings hurt." In a burst of generosity, "She's the
                    most considerate human being I ever knew. She'd give up anything rather than see
                    someone else put out. She's too much that way." </p>
                <p>"We can't be too much that way," said Mrs. Warham in mechanical Christian
                    reproof. </p>
                <p>"Oh, I know," retorted Ruth, "that's all very well for church and Sundays. But I
                    guess if you want to get along you've got to look out for Number One. . . . Yes,
                    she ought to visit somewhere." </p>
                <p>"I've been trying to think," said her mother. "She couldn't go any place but your
                    Uncle Zeke's. But it's so lonesome out there I haven't the heart to send her.
                    Besides, she wouldn't know what to make of it." </p>
                <p>"What'd father say?" </p>
                <p>"That's another thing." Mrs. Warham had latterly grown jealous&mdash; not
                    without reason&mdash;of her husband's partiality for Susan. </p>
                <p>Ruth sighed. "Oh, dear!" cried she. "I don't know what to do. How's she ever
                    going to get married!" </p>
                <p>"If she'd only been a boy!" said Mrs. Warham, on her knees, taking the unevenness
                    out of the front of the skirt. "A girl has to suffer for her mother's sins." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0057" n="34"/>

                <p>Ruth made no reply. She smiled to herself&mdash;the comment of the younger
                    generation upon the older. Sin it might have been; but, worse than that, it was
                    a stupidity&mdash;to let a man make a fool of her. Lorella must have been a
                    poor weak-minded creature. </p>
                <p>By dinner time Ruth had completely soothed and smoothed her vanity. Sam had been
                    caught by Susan simply because he had seen Susan before he saw her. </p>
                <p>All that would be necessary was a good chance at him, and he would never look at
                    Susan again. He had been in the East, where the admired type was her
                    own&mdash;refined, ladylike, the woman of the dainty appearance and manners
                    and tastes. A brief undisturbed exposure to her charms and Susan would seem
                    coarse and countrified to him. There was no denying that Susan had style, but it
                    was fully effective only when applied to a sunny fairy-like beauty such as hers. </p>
                <p>But at midday, when Susan came in with Warham, Ruth's jealousy opened all her
                    inward-bleeding wounds again. Susan's merry eyes, her laughing mouth, her funny
                    way of saying even commonplace things&mdash;how could quiet, unobtrusive,
                    ladylike charms such as Ruth's have a chance if Susan were about? She waited,
                    silent and anxious, while her mother was having the talk with her father in the
                    sitting-room. Warham, mere man, was amused by his wife's scheming. </p>
                <p>"Don't put yourself out, Fanny," said he. "If the boy wants Ruth and she wants
                    him, why, well and good. But you'll only make a mess interfering. Let the young
                    people alone." </p>
                <p>"I'm surprised, George Warham," cried Fanny, "that you can show so little sense
                    and heart." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0058" n="35"/>

                <p>"To hear you talk, I'd think marriage was a business, like groceries." </p>
                <p>Mrs. Warham thought it was, in a sense. But she would never have dared say so
                    aloud, even to her husband&mdash;or, rather, especially to her husband. In
                    matters of men and women he was thoroughly innocent, with the simplicity of the
                    old-time man of the small town and the country; he fancied that, while in
                    grocery matters and the like the world was full of guile, in matters of the
                    heart it was idyllic, Arcadian, with never a thought of duplicity, except among
                    a few obviously wicked and designing people. </p>
                <p>"I guess we both want to see Ruth married well," was all she could venture. </p>
                <p>"I'd rather the girls stayed with us," declared Warham. "I'd hate to give them
                    up." </p>
                <p>"Of course," hastily agreed Fanny. "Still&mdash;it's the regular order of
                    nature." </p>
                <p>"Oh, Ruth'll marry&mdash;only too soon," said Warham. "And marry well. I'm
                    not so sure, though, that marrying any of old Wright's breed would be marrying
                    what ought to be called well. Money isn't everything&mdash;not by a long
                    sight&mdash;though, of course, it's comfortable." </p>
                <p>"I never heard anything against Sam," protested Mrs. Warham. </p>
                <p>"You've heard what I've heard&mdash;that he's wild and loose. But then you
                    women like that in a man." </p>
                <p>"We've got to put up with it, you mean," cried Fanny, indignant. </p>
                <p>"Women like it," persisted Warham. "And I guess Sam's only sowing the usual wild
                    oats, getting ready to settle. No, mother, you let Ruth alone. If she wants him,
                    she'll get him&mdash;she or Susan." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0059" n="36"/>
                <p>Mrs. Warham compressed her lips and lowered her eyes. Ruth or Susan&mdash;as
                    if it didn't matter which! "Susan isn't _ours_," she could not refrain from
                    saying. </p>
                <p>"Indeed, she is!" retorted George warmly. "Why, she couldn't be more our
                    own&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Yes, certainly," interrupted Fanny. </p>
                <p>She moved toward the door. She saw that without revealing her entire
                    scheme&mdash;hers and Ruth's&mdash;she could make no headway with
                    George. And if she did reveal it he would sternly veto it. So she gave up that
                    direction. She went upstairs; George took his hat from the front hall rack and
                    pushed open the screen door. As he appeared on the veranda Susan was picking
                    dead leaves from one of the hanging baskets; Ruth, seated in the hammock, hands
                    in lap, her whole attitude intensely still, was watching her with narrowed eyes. </p>
                <p>"What's this I hear," cried Warham, laughing, "about you two girls setting your
                    caps for Sam Wright?" And his good-humored brown eyes glanced at Ruth, passed on
                    to Susan's wealth of wavy dark hair and long, rounded form, and lingered there. </p>
                <p>Ruth lowered her eyes and compressed her lips, a trick she had borrowed from her
                    mother along with the peculiarities of her mother's disposition that it fitted.
                    Susan flung a laughing glance over her shoulder at her uncle. "Not Ruth," said
                    she. "Only me. I saw him first, so he's mine. He's coming to see me this
                    evening." </p>
                <p>"So I hear. Well, the moon's full and your aunt and I'll not
                    interrupt&mdash;at least not till ten o'clock. No callers on a child like
                    you after ten." </p>
                <p>"Oh, I don't think I'll be able to hold him that long." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0060" n="37"/>

                <p>"Don't you fret, Brownie. But I mustn't make you vain. Coming along to the
                    store?" </p>
                <p>"No. Tomorrow," said Susan. "I can finish in the morning. I'm going to wear my
                    white dress with embroidery, and it's got to be pressed&mdash;and that means
                    I must do it myself." </p>
                <p>"Poor Sam! And I suppose, when he calls, you'll come down as if you'd put on any
                    old thing and didn't care whether he came or not. And you'll have primped for an
                    hour&mdash;and he, too&mdash;shaving and combing and trying different
                    ties." </p>
                <p>Susan sparkled at the idea of a young man, and _such_ a young man, taking trouble
                    for her. Ruth, pale, kept her eyes down and her lips compressed. She was
                    picturing the gallant appearance the young Sophomore from Yale, away off in the
                    gorgeous fashionable East, would make as he came in at that gate yonder and up
                    the walk and seated himself on the veranda&mdash;with Susan! Evidently her
                    mother had failed; Susan was not to be taken away. </p>
                <p>When Warham departed down the walk Ruth rose; she could not bear being alone with
                    her triumphant rival&mdash;triumphant because unconscious. She knew that to
                    get Sam to herself all she would have to do would be to hint to Susan, the
                    generous, what she wanted. But pride forbade that. As her hand was on the knob
                    of the screen door, Susan said: "Why don't you like Sam?" </p>
                <p>"Oh, I think he's stuck-up. He's been spoiled in the East." </p>
                <p>"Why, I don't see any sign of it." </p>
                <p>"You were too flattered by his talking to you," said Ruth, with a sweet-sour
                    little laugh&mdash;an asp of a sneer hid in a basket of flowers. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0061" n="38"/>
                <p>Susan felt the sting; but, seeing only the flowers, did not dream whence it had
                    come. "It _was_ nice, wasn't it?" said she, gayly. "Maybe you're right about
                    him, but I can't help liking him. You must admit he's handsome." </p>
                <p>"He has a bad look in his eyes," replied Ruth. Such rage against Susan was
                    swelling within her that it seemed to her she would faint if she did not release
                    at least part of it. "You want to look out for him, Susie," said she, calmly and
                    evenly. "You don't want to take what he says seriously." </p>
                <p>"Of course not," said Susan, quite honestly, though she, no more than the next
                    human being, could avoid taking seriously whatever was pleasantly flattering. </p>
                <p>"He'd never think of marrying you." Ruth trembled before and after delivering
                    this venomous shaft. </p>
                <p>"Marrying!" cried Susan, again quite honestly. "Why, I'm only seventeen." </p>
                <p>Ruth drew a breath of relief. The shaft had glanced off the armor of innocence
                    without making the faintest dent. She rushed into the house. She did not dare
                    trust herself with her cousin. What might the demon within her tempt her to say
                    next? </p>
                <p>"Come up, Ruth!" called her mother. "The dress is ready for the last try-on. I
                    think it's going to hang beautifully." </p>
                <p>Ruth dragged herself up the stairs, lagged into the sitting-room, gazed at the
                    dress with a scowl. "What did father say?" she asked. </p>
                <p>"It's no use trying to do anything with your father." </p>
                <p>Ruth flung herself in a corner of the sofa. </p>
                <p>"The only thing I can think of," said her mother, humbly and timidly, "is phone
                    the Sinclairs as I originally set out to do." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0062" n="39"/>
                <p>"And have the whole town laughing at me. . . . Oh, what do I care, anyhow!" </p>
                <p>"Arthur Sinclair's taller and a sight handsomer. Right in the face, Sam's as
                    plain as Dick's hatband. His looks is all clothes and polish&mdash;and
                    mighty poor polish, I think. Arthur's got rise in him, too, while
                    Sam&mdash;well, I don't know what'd become of him if old Wright lost his
                    money." </p>
                <p>But Arthur, a mere promise, seemed poor indeed beside Sam, the actually arrived.
                    To marry Sam would be to step at once into grandeur; to marry Arthur would mean
                    years of struggle. Besides, Arthur was heavy, at least seemed heavy to light
                    Ruth, while Sam was her ideal of gay elegance. "I _detest_ Arthur Sinclair," she
                    now announced. </p>
                <p>"You can get Sam if you want him," said her mother confidently. "One evening with
                    a mere child like Susie isn't going to amount to much." </p>
                <p>Ruth winced. "Do you suppose I don't know that?" cried she. "What makes me so mad
                    is his impudence&mdash;coming here to see her when he wouldn't marry her or
                    take her any place. It's insulting to us all." </p>
                <p>"Oh, I don't think it's as bad as all that, Ruthie," soothed her mother, too
                    simple-minded to accept immediately this clever subtlety of self-deception. </p>
                <p>"You know this town&mdash;how people talk. Why, his sister&mdash;" and
                    she related their conversation at the gate that morning. </p>
                <p>"You ought to have sat on her hard, Ruth," said Mrs. Warham, with dangerously
                    sparkling eyes. "No matter what we may think privately, it gives people a low
                    opinion of us to&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Don't I know that!" shrilled Ruth. She began to weep. "I'm ashamed of myself." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0063" n="40"/>

                <p>"But we must try the dress on." Mrs. Warham spread the skirt, using herself as
                    form. "Isn't it too lovely!" </p>
                <p>Ruth dried her eyes as she gazed. The dress was indeed lovely. But her pleasure
                    in it was shadowed by the remembrance that most of the loveliness was due to
                    Susan's suggestions. Still, she tried it on, and felt better. She would linger
                    until Sam came, would exhibit herself to him; and surely he would not tarry long
                    with Susan. This project improved the situation greatly. She began her toilet
                    for the evening at once, though it was only three o'clock. Susan finished her
                    pressing and started to dress at five&mdash;because she knew Ruth would be
                    appealing to her to come in and help put the finishing touches to the toilet for
                    the party. And, sure enough, at half-past five, before she had nearly finished,
                    Ruth, with a sneaking humility, begged her to come "for half a
                    minute&mdash;if you don't mind&mdash;and have got time." </p>
                <p>Susan did Ruth's hair over, made her change to another color of stockings and
                    slippers, put the dress on her, did nearly an hour's refitting and redraping.
                    Both were late for supper; and after supper Susan had to make certain final
                    amendments to the wonderful toilet, and then get herself ready. So it was Ruth
                    alone who went down when Sam Wright came. "My, but you do look all to the good,
                    Ruth!" cried Sam. And his eyes no less than his tone showed that he meant it. He
                    hadn't realized what a soft white neck the blond cousin had, or how perfectly
                    her shoulders rounded into her slim arms. As Ruth moved to depart, he said:
                    "Don't be in such a rush. Wait till Susie finishes her primping and comes down." </p>
                <p>"She had to help me," said Ruth, with a righteousness <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0064" n="41"/> she could justly plume herself upon.
                    "That's why she's late. No, I must get along." She was wise enough to resist the
                    temptation to improve upon an already splendid impression. "Come as soon as you
                    can." </p>
                <p>"I'll be there in a few minutes," Sam assured her convincingly. "Save some dances
                    for me." </p>
                <p>Ruth went away happy. At the gate she glanced furtively back. Sam was looking
                    after her. She marched down the street with light step. "I must wear low-necked
                    dresses more in the evenings," she said to herself. "It's foolish for a girl to
                    hide a good neck." </p>
                <p>Sam, at the edge of the veranda, regretting his promise to call on Susan, was
                    roused by her voice: "Did you ever see anything as lovely as Ruth?" </p>
                <p>Sam's regret vanished the instant he looked at her, and the greedy expression
                    came into his sensual, confident young face. "She's a corker," said he. "But I'm
                    content to be where I am." </p>
                <p>Susan's dress was not cut out in the neck, was simply of the collarless kind
                    girls of her age wear. It revealed the smooth, voluptuous yet slender column of
                    her throat. And her arms, bare to just above the elbows, were exquisite. But
                    Susan's fascination did not lie in any or in all of her charms, but in that
                    subtlety of magnetism which account for all the sensational phenomena of the
                    relations of men and women. She was a clever girl&mdash;clever beyond her
                    years, perhaps&mdash;though in this day seventeen is not far from fully
                    developed womanhood. But even had she been silly, men would have been glad to
                    linger on and on under the spell of the sex call which nature had subtly woven
                    into the texture of her voice, into the glance <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0065"
                        n="42"/> of her eyes, into the delicate emanations of her skin. </p>
                <p>They talked of all manner of things&mdash;games and college East and
                    West&mdash;the wonders of New York&mdash;the weather, finally. Sam was
                    every moment of the time puzzling how to bring up the one subject that
                    interested both above all others, that interested him to the exclusion of all
                    others. He was an ardent student of the game of man and woman, had made
                    considerable progress at it&mdash;remarkable progress, in view of his bare
                    twenty years. He had devised as many "openings" as an expert chess player. None
                    seemed to fit this difficult case how to make love to a girl of his own class
                    whom his conventional, socially ambitious nature forbade him to consider
                    marrying. As he observed her in the moonlight, he said to himself: "I've got to
                    look out or I'll make a damn fool of myself with her." For his heady passion was
                    fast getting the better of those prudent instincts he had inherited from a
                    father who almost breathed by calculation. </p>
                <p>While he was still struggling for an "opening," Susan eager to help him but not
                    knowing how, there came from the far interior of the house three distant raps.
                    "Gracious!" exclaimed Susan. "That's Uncle George. It must be ten o'clock." With
                    frank regret, "I'm so sorry. I thought it was early." </p>
                <p>"Yes, it did seem as if I'd just come," said Sam. Her shy innocence was
                    contagious. He felt an awkward country lout. "Well, I suppose I must go." </p>
                <p>"But you'll come again&mdash;sometime?" she asked wistfully. It was her first
                    real beau&mdash;the first that had interested her&mdash;and what a dream
                    lover of a beau he looked, standing before her in that wonderful light! </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0066" n="43"/>
                <p>"Come? Rather!" exclaimed he in a tone of enthusiasm that could not but flatter
                    her into a sort of intoxication. "I'd have hard work staying away. But
                    Ruth&mdash;she'll always be here." </p>
                <p>"Oh, she goes out a lot&mdash;and I don't." </p>
                <p>"Will you telephone me&mdash;next time she's to be out?" </p>
                <p>`Yes," agreed she with a hesitation that was explained when she added: "But don't
                    think you've got to come. . . . Oh, I must go in!" </p>
                <p>"Good night&mdash;Susie." Sam held out his hand. She took it with a queer
                    reluctance. She felt nervous, afraid, as if there were something uncanny lurking
                    somewhere in those moonlight shadows. She gently tried to draw her hand away,
                    but he would not let her. She made a faint struggle, then yielded. It was so
                    wonderful, the sense of the touch of his hand. "Susie!" he said hoarsely. And
                    she knew he felt as she did. Before she realized it his arms were round her, and
                    his lips had met hers. "You drive me crazy," he whispered. </p>
                <p>Both were trembling; she had become quite cold&mdash;her cheeks, her hand,
                    her body even. "You mustn't," she murmured, drawing gently away. </p>
                <p>"You set me crazy," he repeated. "Do you&mdash;love me&mdash;a little?" </p>
                <p>"Oh, I must go!" she pleaded. Tears were glistening in her long dark lashes. The
                    sight of them maddened him. "Do you&mdash;Susie?" he pleaded. </p>
                <p>"I'm&mdash;I'm&mdash;very young," she stammered. </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I know," he assented eagerly. "But not too young to
                    love, Susie? No. Because you do&mdash;don't you?" </p>
                <p>The moonlit world seemed a fairyland. "Yes," she said softly. "I guess so. I must
                    go. I must." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0067" n="44"/>
                <p>And moved beyond her power to control herself, she broke from his detaining hand
                    and fled into the house. She darted up to her room, paused in the middle of the
                    floor, her hands clasped over her wildly beating heart. When she could move she
                    threw open the shutters and went out on the balcony. She leaned against the
                    window frame and gazed up at the stars, instinctively seeking the companionship
                    of the infinite. Curiously enough, she thought little about Sam. She was awed
                    and wonderstruck before the strange mysterious event within her, the opening up,
                    the flowering of her soul. These vast emotions, where did they come from? What
                    were they? Why did she long to burst into laughter, to burst into tears? Why did
                    she do neither, but simply stand motionless, with the stars blazing and reeling
                    in the sky and her heart beating like mad and her blood surging and ebbing? Was
                    this&mdash;love? Yes&mdash;it must be love. Oh, how wonderful love
                    was&mdash;and how sad&mdash;and how happy beyond all
                    laughter&mdash;and how sweet! She felt an enormous tenderness for everybody
                    and for everything, for all the world&mdash;an overwhelming sense of beauty
                    and goodness. Her lips were moving. She was amazed to find she was repeating the
                    one prayer she knew, the one Aunt Fanny had taught her in babyhood. Why should
                    she find herself praying? Love&mdash;love love! She was a woman and she
                    loved! So this was what it meant to be a woman; it meant to love! </p>
                <p>She was roused by the sound of Ruth saying good night to someone at the gate,
                    invisible because of the intervening foliage. Why, it must be dreadfully late.
                    The Dipper had moved away round to the south, and the heat of the day was all
                    gone, and the air was full of the cool, scented breath of leaves and flowers <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0068" n="45"/> and grass. Ruth's lights shone out
                    upon the balcony. Susan turned to slip into her own room. But Ruth heard, called
                    out peevishly: </p>
                <p>"Who's there?" </p>
                <p>"Only me," cried Susan. </p>
                <p>She longed to go in and embrace Ruth, and kiss her. She would have liked to ask
                    Ruth to let her sleep with her, but she felt Ruth wouldn't understand. </p>
                <p>"What are you doing out there?" demanded Ruth. "It's 'way after one." </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;dear&mdash;I must go to bed," cried Susan. Ruth's voice somehow
                    seemed to be knocking and tumbling her new dream-world. </p>
                <p>"What time did Sam Wright leave here?" asked Ruth. </p>
                <p>She was standing in her window now. Susan saw that her face looked tired and
                    worn, almost homely. </p>
                <p>"At ten," she replied. "Uncle George knocked on the banister." </p>
                <p>"Are you sure it was ten?" said Ruth sharply. </p>
                <p>"I guess so. Yes&mdash;it was ten. Why?" </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;nothing." </p>
                <p>"Was he at Sinclairs'?" </p>
                <p>"He came as it was over. He and Lottie brought me home." Ruth was eyeing her
                    cousin evilly. "How did you two get on?" </p>
                <p>Susan flushed from head to foot. "Oh&mdash;so-so," she answered, in an
                    uncertain voice. </p>
                <p>"I don't know why he didn't come to Sinclairs'," snapped Ruth. </p>
                <p>Susan flushed again&mdash;a delicious warmth from head to foot. She knew why.
                    So he, too, had been dreaming alone. Love! Love! </p>
                <p>"What are you smiling at?" cried Ruth crossly. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0069"/>
                <p>"Was I smiling?. . . Do you want me to help you undress?" </p>
                <p>"No," was the curt answer. "Good night." </p>
                <p>"Please let me unhook it, at least," urged Susan, following Ruth into her room. </p>
                <p>Ruth submitted. </p>
                <p>"Did you have a good time?" asked Susan. </p>
                <p>"Of course," snapped Ruth. "What made you think I didn't?" </p>
                <p>"Don't be a silly, dear. I didn't think so." </p>
                <p>"I had an awful time&mdash;awful!" </p>
                <p>Ruth began to sob, turned fiercely on Susan. "Leave me alone!" she cried. "I hate
                    to have you touch me." The dress was, of course, entirely unfastened in the
                    back. </p>
                <p>"You had a quarrel with Arthur?" asked Susan with sympathy. "But you know he
                    can't keep away from you. Tomorrow&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Be careful, Susan, how you let Sam Wright hang around you," cried Ruth, with
                    blazing eyes and trembling lips. "You be careful&mdash;that's all I've got
                    to say." </p>
                <p>"Why, what do you mean?" asked Susan wonderingly. </p>
                <p>"Be careful! He'd never think for a minute of marrying you." </p>
                <p>The words meant nothing to Susan; but the tone stabbed into her heart. "Why not?"
                    she said. </p>
                <p>Ruth looked at her cousin, hung her head in shame. "Go&mdash;go!" she begged.
                    "Please go. I'm a bad girl&mdash;bad&mdash;_bad_! Go!" And, crying
                    hysterically, she pushed amazed Susan through the connecting door, closed and
                    bolted it. </p>

                <head>IV</head>
                <p> WHEN Fanny Warham was young her mother&mdash;compelled by her
                    father&mdash;roused&mdash;"routed out"&mdash;the children at
                    half-past six on week days and at seven on Sundays for prayers and breakfast, no
                    matter what time they had gone to bed the night before. The horror of this made
                    such an impression upon her that she never permitted Ruth and Susan to be
                    awakened; always they slept until they had "had their sleep out." Regularity was
                    no doubt an excellent thing for health and for moral discipline; but the best
                    rule could be carried to foolish extremes. Until the last year Mrs. Warham had
                    made her two girls live a life of the strictest simplicity and regularity, with
                    the result that they were the most amazingly, soundly, healthy girls in
                    Sutherland. And the regimen still held, except when they had company in the
                    evening or went out&mdash;and Mrs. Warham saw to it that there was not too
                    much of that sort of thing. In all her life thus far Susan had never slept less
                    than ten hours, rarely less than twelve. </p>
                <p>It lacked less than a minute of ten o'clock the morning after Sam's call when
                    Susan's eyes opened upon her simple, pale-gray bedroom, neat and fresh. She
                    looked sleepily at the little clock on the night stand. </p>
                <p>"Mercy me!" she cried. And her bare feet were on the floor and she was stretching
                    her lithe young body, weak from the relaxation of her profound sleep. </p>
                <p>She heard someone stirring in Ruth's room; instantly Ruth's remark, "He'd never
                    think for a minute of <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0071" n="48"/> marrying you,"
                    popped into her head. It still meant nothing to her. She could not have
                    explained why it came back or why she fell to puzzling over it as if it held
                    some mysterious meaning. Perhaps the reason was that from early childhood there
                    had been accumulating in some dusky chamber of her mind stray happenings and
                    remarks, all baring upon the unsuspected secret of her birth and the unsuspected
                    strangeness of her position in the world where everyone else was definitely
                    placed and ticketed. She was wondering about Ruth's queer hysterical outburst,
                    evidently the result of a quarrel with Arthur Sinclair. "I guess Ruth cares more
                    for him than she lets on," thought she. This love that had come to her so
                    suddenly and miraculously made her alert for signs of love elsewhere. </p>
                <p>She went to the bolted connecting door; she could not remember when it had ever
                    been bolted before, and she felt forlorn and shut out. "Ruth!" she called. </p>
                <p>"Is that you?" </p>
                <p>A brief silence, then a faint "Yes." </p>
                <p>"May I come in?" </p>
                <p>"You'd better take your bath and get downstairs." </p>
                <p>This reminded her that she was hungry. She gathered her underclothes together,
                    and with the bundle in her arms darted across the hall into the bathroom. The
                    cold water acted as champagne promises to act but doesn't. She felt giddy with
                    health and happiness. And the bright sun was flooding the bathroom, and the
                    odors from the big bed of hyacinths in the side lawn scented the warm breeze
                    from the open window. When she dashed back to her room she was singing, and her
                    singing voice was as charming as her speaking voice promised. A few minutes and
                    her hair <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0072" n="49"/> had gone up in careless grace
                    and she was clad in a fresh dress of tan linen, full in the blouse. This, with
                    her tan stockings and tan slippers and the radiant youth of her face, gave her a
                    look of utter cleanness and freshness that was exceedingly good to see. </p>
                <p>"I'm ready," she called. </p>
                <p>There was no answer; doubtless Ruth had already descended. She rushed downstairs
                    and into the dining-room. No one was at the little table set in one of the
                    windows in readiness for the late breakfasters. </p>
                <p>Molly came, bringing cocoa, a cereal, hot biscuit and crab-apple preserves, all
                    attractively arranged on a large tray. </p>
                <p>"I didn't bring much, Miss Susie," she apologized. "It's so late, and I don't
                    want you to spoil your dinner. We're going to have the grandest chicken that
                    ever came out of an egg." </p>
                <p>Susan surveyed the tray with delighted eyes. "That's plenty," she said, "if you
                    don't talk too much about the chicken. Where's Ruth?" </p>
                <p>"She ain't coming down. She's got a headache. It was that salad for supper over
                    to Sinclairs' last night. Salad ain't fit for a dog to eat,
                    nohow&mdash;that's _my_ opinion. And at night&mdash;it's sure to bust
                    your face out or give you the headache or both." </p>
                <p>Susan ate with her usual enthusiasm, thinking the while of Sam and wondering how
                    she could contrive to see him. She remembered her promise to her uncle. She had
                    not eaten nearly so much as she wanted. But up she sprang and in fifteen minutes
                    was on her way to the store. She had seen neither Ruth nor her aunt. "_He_'ll be
                    waiting for me to pass," she thought. And she was not disappointed. There he
                    stood, at the footpath gate into his father's place. He had arrayed <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0073" n="50"/> himself in a blue and white flannel
                    suit, white hat and shoes; a big expensive-looking cigarette adorned his lips.
                    The Martins, the Delevans, the Castles and the Bowens, neighbors across the way,
                    were watching him admiringly through the meshes of lace window curtains. She
                    expected that he would come forward eagerly. Instead, he continued to lean
                    indolently on the gate, as if unaware of her approach. And when she was close at
                    hand, his bow and smile were, so it seemed to her, almost coldly polite. Into
                    her eyes came a confused, hurt expression. </p>
                <p>"Susie&mdash;sweetheart," he said, the voice in as astonishing contrast as
                    the words to his air of friendly indifference. "They're watching us from the
                    windows all around here." </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;yes," assented she, as if she understood. But she didn't. In
                    Sutherland the young people were not so mindful of gossip, which it was
                    impossible to escape, anyhow. Still&mdash;off there in the East, no doubt,
                    they had more refined ways; without a doubt, whatever Sam did was the correct
                    thing. </p>
                <p>"Do you still care as you did last night?" he asked. The effect of his words upon
                    her was so obvious that he glanced nervously round. It was delightful to be able
                    to evoke a love like this; but he did wish others weren't looking. </p>
                <p>"I'm going to Uncle's store," she said. "I'm late." </p>
                <p>"I'll walk part of the way with you," he volunteered, and they started on.
                    "That&mdash;that kiss," he stammered. "I can feel it yet." </p>
                <p>She blushed deeply, happily. Her beauty made him tingle. "So can I," she said. </p>
                <p>They walked in silence several squares. "When will I see you again?" he asked.
                    "Tonight?" </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0074" n="51"/>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;do come down. But&mdash;Ruth'll be there. I believe Artie
                    Sinclair's coming." </p>
                <p>"Oh, that counter-jumper?" </p>
                <p>She looked at him in surprise. "He's an awfully nice fellow," said she. "About
                    the nicest in town." </p>
                <p>"Of course," replied Sam elaborately. "I beg your pardon. They think differently
                    about those things in the East." </p>
                <p>"What thing?" </p>
                <p>"No matter." </p>
                <p>Sam, whose secret dream was to marry some fashionable Eastern woman and cut a
                    dash in Fifth Avenue life, had no intention of explaining what was what to one
                    who would not understand, would not approve, and would be made auspicious of
                    him. "I suppose Ruth and Sinclair'll pair off and give us a chance." </p>
                <p>"You'll come?" </p>
                <p>"Right after din&mdash;supper, I mean. In the East we have dinner in the
                    evening." </p>
                <p>"Isn't that queer!" exclaimed Susan. But she was thinking of the joys in store
                    for her at the close of the day. </p>
                <p>"I must go back now," said Sam. Far up the street he saw his sister's pony cart
                    coming. </p>
                <p>"You might as well walk to the store." It seemed to her that they both had ever
                    so much to say to each other, and had said nothing. </p>
                <p>"No. I can't go any further. Good-by&mdash;that is, till tonight." </p>
                <p>He was red and stammering. As they shook hands emotion made them speechless. He
                    stumbled awkwardly as he turned to leave, became still more hotly self-conscious
                    when he saw the grin on the faces of the group of loungers at a packing case
                    near the curb. <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0075" n="52"/> Susan did not see the
                    loafers, did not see anything distinctly. Her feet sought the uneven brick
                    sidewalk uncertainly, and the blood was pouring into her cheeks, was steaming in
                    her brain, making a red mist before her eyes. She was glad he had left her. The
                    joy of being with him was so keen that it was pain. Now she could breathe freely
                    and could dream&mdash;dream&mdash;dream. She made blunder after blunder
                    in working over the accounts with her uncle, and he began to tease her. </p>
                <p>"You sure are in love, Brownie," declared he. Her painful but happy blush
                    delighted him. </p>
                <p>"Tell me all about it?" </p>
                <p>She shook her head, bending it low to hide her color. </p>
                <p>"No?. . . Sometime?" </p>
                <p>She nodded. She was glancing shyly and merrily at him now. </p>
                <p>"Well, some hold that first love's best. Maybe so. But it seems to me any time's
                    good enough. Still&mdash;the first time's mighty fine eh?" He sighed. "My,
                    but it's good to be young!" And he patted her thick wavy hair. </p>
                <p>It did not leak out until supper that Sam was coming. Warham said to Susan,
                    "While Ruth's looking out for Artie, you and I'll have a game or so of chess,
                    Brownie." Susan colored violently. "What?" laughed Warham. "Are _you_ going to
                    have a beau too?" </p>
                <p>Susan felt two pairs of feminine eyes pounce&mdash;hostile eyes, savagely
                    curious. She paled with fright as queer, as unprecedented, as those hostile
                    glances. It seemed to her that she had done or was about to do something
                    criminal. She could not speak. </p>
                <p>An awful silence, then her aunt&mdash;she no longer <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0076" n="53"/> seemed her loving aunt&mdash;asked
                    in an ominous voice: "Is someone coming to see you, Susan?" </p>
                <p>"Sam Wright"&mdash;stammered Susan&mdash;"I saw him this
                    morning&mdash;he was at their gate&mdash;and he said&mdash;I think
                    he's coming." </p>
                <p>A dead silence&mdash;Warham silent because he was eating, but the two others
                    not for that reason. </p>
                <p>Susan felt horribly guilty, and for no reason. "I'd have spoken of it before,"
                    she said, "but there didn't seem to be any chance." She had the instinct of fine
                    shy nature to veil the soul; she found it hard to speak of anything as sacred as
                    this love of hers and whatever related to it. </p>
                <p>"I can't allow this, Susie," said her aunt, with lips tightly drawn against the
                    teeth. "You are too young." </p>
                <p>"Oh, come now, mother," cried Warham, good-humoredly. "That's foolishness. Let
                    the young folks have a good time. You didn't think you were too young at Susie's
                    age." </p>
                <p>"You don't understand, George," said Fanny after she had given him a private
                    frown. Susie's gaze was on the tablecloth. "I can't permit Sam to come here to
                    see Susie." </p>
                <p>Ruth's eyes were down also. About her lips was a twitching that meant a struggle
                    to hide a pleased smile. </p>
                <p>"I've no objection to Susie's having boys of her own age come to see her,"
                    continued Mrs. Warham in the same precise, restrained manner. "But Sam is too
                    old." </p>
                <p>"Now, mother&mdash;" </p>
                <p>Mrs. Warham met his eyes steadily. "I must protect my sister's child, George,"
                    she said. At last she <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0077" n="54"/> had found what
                    she felt was a just reason for keeping Sam away from Susan, so her tone was
                    honest and strong. </p>
                <p>Warham lowered his gaze. He understood. "Oh&mdash;as you think best, Fan; I
                    didn't mean to interfere," said he awkwardly. He turned on Susan with his
                    affection in his eyes. "Well, Brownie, it looks like chess with your old uncle,
                    doesn't it?" </p>
                <p>Susan's bosom was swelling, her lip trembling. "I&mdash;I&mdash;" she
                    began. She choked back the sobs, faltered out: "I don't think I could, Uncle,"
                    and rushed from the room. </p>
                <p>There was an uncomfortable pause. Then Warham said, "I must say, Fan, I
                    think&mdash;if you had to do it&mdash;you might have spared the girl's
                    feelings." </p>
                <p>Mrs. Warham felt miserable about it also. "Susie took me by surprise," she
                    apologized. Then, defiantly, "And what else can I do? You know he doesn't come
                    for any good." </p>
                <p>Warham stared in amazement. "Now, what does _that_ mean?" he demanded. </p>
                <p>"You know very well what it means," retorted his wife. </p>
                <p>Her tone made him understand. He reddened, and with too blustering anger brought
                    his fist down on the table. </p>
                <p>"Susan's our daughter. She's Ruth's sister." </p>
                <p>Ruth pushed back her chair and stood up. Her expression made her look much older
                    than she was. "I wish you could induce the rest of the town to think that,
                    papa," said she. "It'd make my position less painful." And she, too, left the
                    room. </p>
                <p>"What's she talking about?" asked Warham. </p>
                <p>"It's true, George," replied Fanny with trembling <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0078" n="55"/> lip. "It's all my
                    fault&mdash;insisting on keeping her. I might have known!" </p>
                <p>"I think you and Ruth must be crazy. I've seen no sign." </p>
                <p>"Have you seen any of the boys calling on Susan since she shot up from a child to
                    a girl? Haven't you noticed she isn't invited any more except when it can't be
                    avoided?" </p>
                <p>Warham's face was fiery with rage. He looked helplessly, furiously about. But he
                    said nothing. To fight public sentiment would be like trying to thrust back with
                    one's fists an oncreeping fog. Finally he cried, "It's too outrageous to talk
                    about." </p>
                <p>"If I only knew what to do!" moaned Fanny. </p>
                <p>A long silence, while Warham was grasping the fullness of the meaning, the
                    frightful meaning, in these revelations so astounding to him. At last he said: </p>
                <p>"Does _she_ realize?" </p>
                <p>"I guess so . . . I don't know . . . I don't believe she does. She's the most
                    innocent child that ever grew up." </p>
                <p>"If I had a chance, I'd sell out and move away." </p>
                <p>"Where?" said his wife. "Where would people accept&mdash;her?" </p>
                <p>Warham became suddenly angry again. "I don't believe it!" he cried, his look and
                    tone contradicting his words. "You've been making a mountain out of a molehill." </p>
                <p>And he strode from the room, flung on his hat and went for a walk. As Mrs. Warham
                    came from the dining-room a few minutes later, Ruth appeared in the side veranda
                    doorway. "I think I'll telephone Arthur to come tomorrow evening instead," said
                    she. "He'd not like it, with Sam here too." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0079" n="56"/>
                <p>"That would be better," assented her mother. "Yes, I'd telephone him if I were
                    you." </p>
                <p>Thus it came about that Susan, descending the stairs to the library to get a
                    book, heard Ruth say into the telephone in her sweetest voice,
                    "Yes&mdash;tomorrow evening, Arthur. Some others are coming&mdash;the
                    Wrights. You'd have to talk to Lottie . . . I don't blame you. . . . Tomorrow
                    evening, then. So sorry. Good-by." </p>
                <p>The girl on the stairway stopped short, shrank against the wall. A moment, and
                    she hastily reascended, entered her room, closed the door. Love had awakened the
                    woman; and the woman was not so unsuspecting, so easily deceived as the child
                    had been. She understood what her cousin and her aunt were about; they were
                    trying to take her lover from her! She understood her aunt's looks and tones,
                    her cousin's temper and hysteria. She sat down upon the floor and cried with a
                    breaking heart. The injustice of it! The meanness of it! The wickedness of a
                    world where even her sweet cousin, even her loving aunt were wicked! She sat
                    there on the floor a long time, abandoned to the misery of a first shattered
                    illusion, a misery the more cruel because never before had either cousin or aunt
                    said or done anything to cause her real pain. The sound of voices coming through
                    the open window from below made her start up and go out on the balcony. She
                    leaned over the rail. She could not see the veranda for the masses of creeper,
                    but the voices were now quite plain in the stillness. Ruth's voice gay and
                    incessant. Presently a man's voice _his_&mdash;and laughing! Then his voice
                    speaking&mdash;then the two voices mingled&mdash;both talking at once,
                    so eager were they! Her lover&mdash;and Ruth was stealing him from her! Oh,
                    the baseness, the treachery! And her aunt <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0080"
                        n="57"/> was helping!. . . Sore of heart, utterly forlorn, she sat in the
                    balcony hammock, aching with love and jealousy. Every now and then she ran in
                    and looked at the clock. He was staying on and on, though he must have learned
                    she was not coming down. She heard her uncle and aunt come up to bed. Now the
                    piano in the parlor was going. First it was Ruth singing one of her pretty love
                    songs in that clear small voice of hers. Then Sam played and sang&mdash;how
                    his voice thrilled her! Again it was Ruthie singing&mdash;"Sweet Dream
                    Faces"&mdash;Susan began to sob afresh. She could see Ruth at the piano, how
                    beautiful she looked&mdash;and that song&mdash;it would be impossible
                    for him not to be impressed. She felt the jealousy of despair. . . . Ten
                    o'clock&mdash;half-past&mdash;eleven o'clock! She heard them at the edge
                    of the veranda&mdash;so, at last he was going. She was able to hear their
                    words now: </p>
                <p>"You'll be up for the tennis in the morning?" he was saying. </p>
                <p>"At ten," replied Ruth. </p>
                <p>"Of course Susie's asked, too," he said&mdash;and his voice sounded careless,
                    not at all earnest. </p>
                <p>"Certainly," was her cousin's reply. "But I'm not sure she can come." </p>
                <p>It was all the girl at the balcony rail could do to refrain from crying out a
                    protest. But Sam was saying to Ruth: </p>
                <p>"Well&mdash;good night. Haven't had so much fun in a long time. May I come
                    again?" </p>
                <p>"If you don't, I'll think you were bored." </p>
                <p>"Bored!" He laughed. "That's too ridiculous. See you in the morning. Good night.
                    . . . Give my love to Susie, and tell her I was sorry not to see her." </p>
                <p>Susan was all in a glow as her cousin answered, "I'll <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0081" n="58"/> tell her." doubtless Sam didn't note
                    it, but Susan heard the constraint, the hypocrisy in that sweet voice. </p>
                <p>She watched him stroll down to the gate under the arch of boughs dimly lit by the
                    moon. She stretched her arms passionately toward him. Then she went in to go to
                    bed. But at the sound of Ruth humming gayly in the next room, she realized that
                    she could not sleep with her heart full of evil thoughts. She must have it out
                    with her cousin. She knocked on the still bolted door. </p>
                <p>"What is it?" asked Ruth coldly. </p>
                <p>"Let me in," answered Susan. "I've got to see you." </p>
                <p>"Go to bed, Susie. It's late." </p>
                <p>"You must let me in." </p>
                <p>The bolt shot back. "All right. And please unhook my dress&mdash;there's a
                    dear." </p>
                <p>Susan opened the door, stood on the threshold, all her dark passion in her face.
                    "Ruth!" she cried. </p>
                <p>Ruth had turned her back, in readiness for the service the need of which had
                    alone caused her to unbolt the door. At that swift, fierce ejaculation she
                    started, wheeled round. At sight of that wild anger she paled. "Why, Susie!" she
                    gasped. </p>
                <p>"I've found you out!" raged Susan. "You're trying to steal him from
                    me&mdash;you and Aunt Fanny. It isn't fair! I'll not stand it!" </p>
                <p>"What _are_ you talking about?" cried Ruth. "You must have lost your senses." </p>
                <p>"I'll not stand it," Susan repeated, advancing threateningly "He loves me and I
                    love him." </p>
                <p>Ruth laughed. "You foolish girl! Why, he cares nothing about you. The idea of
                    your having your head turned by a little politeness!" </p>
                <p>"He loves me he told me so. And I love him. I <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0082"
                        n="59"/> told him so. He's mine! You shan't take him from me!" </p>
                <p>"He told you he loved you?" </p>
                <p>Ruth's eyes were gleaming and her voice was shrill with hate. "He told you
                    _that_?" </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;he did!" </p>
                <p>"I don't believe you." </p>
                <p>"We love each other," cried the dark girl. "He came to see _me_. You've got
                    Arthur Sinclair. You shan't take him away!" </p>
                <p>The two girls, shaking with fury, were facing each other, were looking into each
                    other's eyes. "If Sam Wright told you he loved you," said Ruth, with the icy
                    deliberateness of a cold-hearted anger, "he was trying to&mdash;to make a
                    fool of you. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. _We_'re trying to save you." </p>
                <p>"He and I are engaged!" declared Susan. "You shan't take him&mdash;and you
                    can't! He _loves_ me!" </p>
                <p>"Engaged!" jeered Ruth. "Engaged!" she laughed, pretending not to believe, yet
                    believing. She was beside herself with jealous anger. "Yes&mdash;we'll save
                    you from yourself. You're like your mother. You'd disgrace us&mdash;as she
                    did." </p>
                <p>"Don't you dare talk that way, Ruth Warham. It's false&mdash;_false_! My
                    mother is dead&mdash;and you're a wicked girl." </p>
                <p>"It's time you knew the truth," said Ruth softly. Her eyes were half shut now and
                    sparkling devilishly. "You haven't got any name. You haven't got any father. And
                    no man of any position would marry you. As for Sam&mdash;" She laughed
                    contemptuously. "Do you suppose Sam Wright would marry a girl without a name?" </p>
                <p>Susan had shrunk against the door jamb. She understood <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0083" n="60"/> only dimly, but things understood
                    dimly are worse than things that are clear. "Me?" she muttered. "Me? Oh, Ruth,
                    you don't mean that." </p>
                <p>"It's true," said Ruth, calmly. "And the sooner you realize it the less likely
                    you are to go the way your mother did." </p>
                <p>Susan stood as if petrified. </p>
                <p>"If Sam Wright comes hanging round you any more, you'll know how to treat him,"
                    Ruth went on. "You'll appreciate that he hasn't any respect for
                    you&mdash;that he thinks you're someone to be trifled with. And if he talked
                    engagement, it was only a pretense. Do you understand?" </p>
                <p>The girl leaning in the doorway gazed into vacancy. After a while she answered
                    dully, "I guess so." </p>
                <p>Ruth began to fuss with the things on her bureau. Susan went into her room, sat
                    on the edge of the bed. A few minutes, and Ruth, somewhat cooled down and not a
                    little frightened, entered. She looked uneasily at the motionless figure.
                    Finally she said, </p>
                <p>"Susie!" </p>
                <p>No answer. </p>
                <p>More sharply, "Susie!" </p>
                <p>"Yes," said Susan, without moving. </p>
                <p>"You understand that I told you for your own good? And you'll not say anything to
                    mother or father? They feel terribly about it, and don't want it ever mentioned.
                    You won't let on that you know?" </p>
                <p>"I'll not tell," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"You know we're fond of you&mdash;and want to do everything for you?" </p>
                <p>No answer. </p>
                <p>"It wasn't true&mdash;what you said about Sam's making love to you?" </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0084" n="61"/>
                <p>"That's all over. I don't want to talk about it." </p>
                <p>"You're not angry with me, Susie? I admit I was angry, but it was best for you to
                    know&mdash;wasn't it?" </p>
                <p>"Yes," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"You're not angry with me?" </p>
                <p>"No." </p>
                <p>Ruth, still more uneasy, turned back into her own room because there was nothing
                    else to do. She did not shut the door between. When she was in her nightgown she
                    glanced in at her cousin. The girl was sitting on the edge of the bed in the
                    same position. "It's after midnight," said Ruth. "You'd better get undressed." </p>
                <p>Susan moved a little. "I will," she said. </p>
                <p>Ruth went to bed and soon fell asleep. After an hour or so she awakened. Light
                    was streaming through the open connecting door. She ran to it, looked in.
                    Susan's clothes were in a heap beside the bed. Susan herself, with the pillows
                    propping her, was staring wide-eyed at the ceiling. It was impossible for Ruth
                    to realize any part of the effect upon her cousin of a thing she herself had
                    known for years and had taken always as a matter of course; she simply felt
                    mildly sorry for unfortunate Susan. </p>
                <p>"Susie, dear," she said gently, "do you want me to turn out the light?" </p>
                <p>"Yes," said Susan. </p>
                <p>Ruth switched off the light and went back to bed, better content. She felt that
                    now Susan would stop her staring and would go to sleep. Sam's call had been very
                    satisfactory. Ruth felt she had shown off to the best advantage, felt that he
                    admired her, would come to see _her_ next time. And now that she had so arranged
                    it that Susan would avoid him, everything would turn out as she wished. "I'll
                    use Arthur to <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0085"/> make him jealous after a
                    while&mdash;and then&mdash;I'll have things my own way." As she fell
                    asleep she was selecting the rooms Sam and she would occupy in the big Wright
                    mansion&mdash;"when we're not in the East or in Europe." </p>

                <p> RUTH had forgotten to close her shutters, so toward seven o'clock the light
                    which had been beating against her eyelids for three hours succeeded in lifting
                    them. She stretched herself and yawned noisily. Susan appeared in the connecting
                    doorway. </p>
                <p>"Are you awake?" she said softly. </p>
                <p>"What time is it?" asked Ruth, too lazy to turn over and look at her clock. </p>
                <p>"Ten to seven." </p>
                <p>"Do close my shutters for me. I'll sleep an hour or two." She hazily made out the
                    figure in the doorway. "You're dressed, aren't you?" she inquired sleepily. </p>
                <p>"Yes," replied Susan. "I've been waiting for you to wake." </p>
                <p>Something in the tone made Ruth forget about sleep and rub her fingers over her
                    eyes to clear them for a view of her cousin. Susan seemed about as
                    usual&mdash;perhaps a little serious, but then she had the habit of strange
                    moods of seriousness. "What did you want?" said Ruth. </p>
                <p>Susan came into the room, sat at the foot of the bed&mdash;there was room, as
                    the bed was long and Ruth short. "I want you to tell me what my mother did." </p>
                <p>"Did?" echoed Ruth feebly. </p>
                <p>"Did, to disgrace you and&mdash;me." </p>
                <p>"Oh, I couldn't explain&mdash;not in a few words. I'm so sleepy. Don't bother
                    about it, Susan." And she <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0087" n="64"/> thrust her
                    head deeper into the pillow. "Close the shutters." </p>
                <p>"Then I'll have to ask Aunt Fanny&mdash;or Uncle George or
                    everybody&mdash;till I find out." </p>
                <p>"But you mustn't do that," protested Ruth, flinging herself from left to right
                    impatiently. "What is it you want to know?" </p>
                <p>"About my mother&mdash;and what she did. And why I have no
                    father&mdash;why I'm not like you&mdash;and the other girls." </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;it's nothing. I can't explain. Don't bother about it. It's no use.
                    It can't be helped. And it doesn't really matter." </p>
                <p>"I've been thinking," said Susan. "I understand a great many things I didn't know
                    I'd noticed&mdash;ever since I was a baby. But what I don't
                    understand&mdash;" She drew a long breath, a cautious breath, as if there
                    were danger of awakening a pain. "What I don't understand is&mdash;why.
                    And&mdash;you must tell me all about it. . . . Was my mother bad?" </p>
                <p>"Not exactly bad," Ruth answered uncertainly. "But she did one thing that was
                    wicked&mdash;at least that a woman never can be forgiven for, if it's found
                    out." </p>
                <p>"Did she&mdash;did she take something that didn't belong to her?" </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;nothing like that. No, she was, they say, as nice and sweet as she
                    could be&mdash;except&mdash;She wasn't married to your father." </p>
                <p>Susan sat in a brown study. "I can't understand," she said at last.
                    "Why&mdash;she _must_ have been married, or&mdash;or&mdash;there
                    wouldn't have been me." </p>
                <p>Ruth smiled uneasily. "Not at all. Don't you really understand?" </p>
                <p>Susan shook her head. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0088" n="65"/>
                <p>"He&mdash;he betrayed her&mdash;and left her&mdash;and then everybody
                    knew because you came." </p>
                <p>Susan's violet-gray eyes rested a grave, inquiring glance upon her cousin's face.
                    "But if he betrayed her&mdash;What does `betray' mean? Doesn't it mean he
                    promised to marry her and didn't?" </p>
                <p>"Something like that," said Ruth. "Yes&mdash;something like that." </p>
                <p>"Then _he_ was the disgrace," said the dark cousin, after reflecting.
                    "No&mdash;you're not telling me, Ruth. _What_ did my mother do?" </p>
                <p>"She had you without being married." </p>
                <p>Again Susan sat in silence, trying to puzzle it out. Ruth lifted herself, put the
                    pillows behind her back. "You don't understand&mdash;anything&mdash;do
                    you? Well, I'll try to explain&mdash;though I don't know much about it." </p>
                <p>And hesitatingly, choosing words she thought fitted to those innocent ears,
                    hunting about for expressions she thought comprehensible to that innocent mind,
                    Ruth explained the relations of the sexes&mdash;an inaccurate, often absurd,
                    explanation, for she herself knew only what she had picked up from other
                    girls&mdash;the fantastic hodgepodge of pruriency, physiology and sheer
                    nonsense which under our system of education distorts and either alarms or
                    inflames the imaginations of girls and boys where the clean, simple truth would
                    at least enlighten them. Susan listened with increasing amazement. </p>
                <p>"Well, do you understand?" Ruth ended. "How we come into the world&mdash;and
                    what marriage means?" </p>
                <p>"I don't believe it," declared Susan. "It's&mdash;awful!" And she shivered
                    with disgust. </p>
                <p>"I tell you it's true," insisted Ruth. "I thought it <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0089" n="66"/> was awful when I first
                    heard&mdash;when Lottie Wright took me out in their orchard, where nobody
                    could listen, and told me what their cook had told her. But I've got kind of
                    used to it." </p>
                <p>"But it&mdash;it's so, then; my mother did marry my father," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"No. She let him betray her. And when a woman lets a man betray her without being
                    married by the preacher or somebody, why, she's ruined forever." </p>
                <p>"But doesn't marriage mean where two people promise to love each other and then
                    betray each other?" </p>
                <p>"If they're married, it isn't betraying," explained Ruth. "If they're not, it is
                    betraying." Susan reflected, nodded slowly. "I guess I understand. But don't you
                    see it was my father who was the disgrace? He was the one that promised to marry
                    and didn't." </p>
                <p>"How foolish you are!" cried Ruth. "I never knew you to be stupid." </p>
                <p>"But isn't it so?" persisted Susan. </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;in a way," her cousin admitted. "Only&mdash;the woman must
                    keep herself pure until the ceremony has been performed." </p>
                <p>"But if he said so to her, wasn't that saying so to God just as much as if the
                    preacher had been there?" </p>
                <p>"No, it wasn't," said Ruth with irritation. "And it's wicked to think such
                    things. All I know is, God says a woman must be married before
                    she&mdash;before she has any children. And your mother wasn't." Susan shook
                    her head. "I guess you don't understand any better than I do&mdash;really." </p>
                <p>"No, I don't," confessed Ruth. "But I'd like to see any man more than kiss me or
                    put his arm round me without our having been married." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0090" n="67"/>
                <p>"But," urged Susan, "if he kissed you, wouldn't that be like marriage?" </p>
                <p>"Some say so," admitted Ruth. "But I'm not so strict. A little kissing and that
                    often leads a man to propose." Susan reflected again. "It all sounds low and
                    sneaking to me," was her final verdict. "I don't want to have anything to do
                    with it. But I'm sure my mother was a good woman. It wasn't her fault if she was
                    lied to, when she loved and believed. And anybody who blames her is low and bad.
                    I'm glad I haven't got any father, if fathers have to be made to promise before
                    everybody or else they'll not keep their word." </p>
                <p>"Well, I'll not argue about it," said Ruth. "I'm telling you the way things are.
                    The woman has to take _all_ the blame." Susan lifted her head haughtily. "I'd be
                    glad to be blamed by anybody who was wicked enough to be that unjust. I'd not
                    have anything to do with such people." </p>
                <p>"Then you'd live alone." </p>
                <p>"No, I shouldn't. There are lots of people who are good and&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"That's wicked, Susan," interrupted Ruth. "All good people think as I tell you
                    they do." </p>
                <p>"Do Aunt Fanny and Uncle George blame my mother?" </p>
                <p>"Of course. How could they help it, when she&mdash;" Ruth was checked by the
                    gathering lightnings in those violet-gray eyes. </p>
                <p>"But," pursued Susan, after a pause, "even if they were wicked enough to blame my
                    mother, they couldn't blame me." </p>
                <p>"Of course not," declared Ruth warmly. "Hasn't everybody always been sweet and
                    kind to you?" </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0091" n="68"/>
                <p>"But last night you said&mdash;" </p>
                <p>Ruth hid her face. "I'm ashamed of what I said last night," she murmured. "I've
                    got, Oh, such a _nasty_ disposition, Susie." </p>
                <p>"But what you said&mdash;wasn't it so?" Ruth turned away her head. </p>
                <p>Susan drew a long sigh, so quietly that Ruth could not have heard. </p>
                <p>"You understand," Ruth said gently, "everybody feels sorry for you
                    and&mdash;" </p>
                <p>Susan frowned stormily, "They'd better feel sorry for themselves." </p>
                <p>"Oh, Susie, dear," cried Ruth, impulsively catching her hand, "we all love you,
                    and mother and father and I&mdash;we'll stand up for you through
                    everything&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Don't you _dare_ feel sorry for me!" Susan cried, wrenching her hand away. </p>
                <p>Ruth's eyes filled with tears. </p>
                <p>"You can't blame us because everybody&mdash;You know, God says, `The sins of
                    the fathers shall be visited on the children&mdash;'" </p>
                <p>"I'm done with everybody," cried Susan, rising and lifting her proud head, "I'm
                    done with God." </p>
                <p>Ruth gave a low scream and shuddered. Susan looked round defiantly, as if she
                    expected a bolt from the blue to come hurtling through the open window. But the
                    sky remained serene, and the quiet, scented breeze continued to play with the
                    lace curtains, and the birds on the balcony did not suspend their chattering
                    courtship. This lack of immediate effect from her declaration of war upon man
                    and God was encouraging. The last of the crushed, cowed feeling Ruth had
                    inspired the night before disappeared. With a soul haughtily plumed and looking
                    defiance from the violet-gray <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0092" n="69"/> eyes,
                    Susan left her cousin and betook herself down to breakfast. </p>
                <p>In common with most children, she had always dreamed of a mysterious fate for
                    herself, different from the commonplace routine around her. Ruth's revelations,
                    far from daunting her, far from making her feel like cringing before the world
                    in gratitude for its tolerance of her bar sinister, seemed a fascinatingly
                    tragic confirmation of her romantic longings and beliefs. No doubt it was the
                    difference from the common lot that had attracted Sam to her; and this
                    difference would make their love wholly unlike the commonplace Sutherland wooing
                    and wedding. Yes, hers had been a mysterious fate, and would continue to be.
                    Nora, an old woman now, had often related in her presence how Doctor Stevens had
                    brought her to life when she lay apparently, indeed really, dead upon the
                    upstairs sitting-room table&mdash;Doctor Stevens and Nora's own prayers. An
                    extraordinary birth, in defiance of the laws of God and man; an extraordinary
                    resurrection, in defiance of the laws of nature&mdash;yes, hers would be a
                    life superbly different from the common. And when she and Sam married, how
                    gracious and forgiving she would be to all those bad-hearted people; how she
                    would shame them for their evil thoughts against her mother and herself! </p>
                <p>The Susan Lenox who sat alone at the little table in the dining-room window,
                    eating bread and butter and honey in the comb, was apparently the same Susan
                    Lenox who had taken three meals a day in that room all those
                    years&mdash;was, indeed, actually the same, for character is not an
                    overnight creation. Yet it was an amazingly different Susan Lenox, too. The
                    first crisis had come; she had been put to the test; and <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0093" n="70"/> she had not collapsed in weakness but
                    had stood erect in strength. </p>
                <p>After breakfast she went down Main Street and at Crooked Creek Avenue took the
                    turning for the cemetery. She sought the Warham plot, on the western slope near
                    the quiet brook. There was a clump of cedars at each corner of the plot; near
                    the largest of them were three little graves&mdash;the three dead children
                    of George and Fanny. In the shadow of the clump and nearest the brook was a
                    fourth grave apart and, to the girl, now thrillingly mysterious: </p>
                <p> LORELLA LENOX BORN MAY 9, 1859 DIED JULY 17, 1879 </p>
                <p> Twenty years old! Susan's tears scalded her eyes. Only a little older than her
                    cousin Ruth was now&mdash;Ruth who often seemed to her, and to everybody,
                    younger than herself. "And she was good&mdash;I know she was good!" thought
                    Susan. "_He_ was bad, and the people who took his part against her were bad. But
                    _she_ was good!" </p>
                <p>She started as Sam's voice, gay and light, sounded directly behind her. "What are
                    you doing in a graveyard?" cried he. </p>
                <p>"How did you find me?" she asked, paling and flushing and paling again. </p>
                <p>"I've been following you ever since you left home." </p>
                <p>He might have added that he did not try to overtake her until they were where
                    people would be least likely to see. </p>
                <p>"Whose graves are those?" he went on, cutting across a plot and stepping on
                    several graves to join her. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0094" n="71"/>

                <p>She was gazing at her mothers simple headstone. His glance followed hers, he
                    read. </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;beg pardon," he said confusedly. "I didn't see." </p>
                <p>She turned her serious gaze from the headstone to his face, which her young
                    imagination transfigured. "You know&mdash;about her?" she asked. </p>
                <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I've heard," he confessed. "But&mdash;Susie, it
                    doesn't amount to anything. It happened a long time ago&mdash;and
                    everybody's forgotten&mdash;and&mdash;" His stammering falsehoods died
                    away before her steady look. "How did you find out?" </p>
                <p>"Someone just told me," replied she. "And they said you'd never respect or marry
                    a girl who had no father. No&mdash;don't deny&mdash;please! I didn't
                    believe it&mdash;not after what we had said to each other." </p>
                <p>Sam, red and shifting uneasily, could not even keep his downcast eyes upon the
                    same spot of ground. </p>
                <p>"You see," she went on, sweet and grave, "they don't understand what love
                    means&mdash;do they?" </p>
                <p>"I guess not," muttered he, completely unnerved. </p>
                <p>Why, how seriously the girl had taken him and his words&mdash;such a few
                    words and not at all definite! No, he decided, it was the kiss. He had heard of
                    girls so innocent that they thought a kiss meant the same as being married. He
                    got himself together as well as he could and looked at her. </p>
                <p>"But, Susie," he said, "you're too young for anything definite&mdash;and I'm
                    not halfway through college." </p>
                <p>"I understand," said she. "But you need not be afraid I'll change." </p>
                <p>She was so sweet, so magnetic, so compelling that in spite of the frowns of
                    prudence he seized her hand. At her touch he flung prudence to the winds. "I
                    love <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0095" n="72"/> you," he cried; and putting his
                    arm around her, he tried to kiss her. She gently but strongly repulsed him. "Why
                    not, dear?" he pleaded. "You love me&mdash;don't you?" </p>
                <p>"Yes," she replied, her honest eyes shining upon his. "But we must wait until
                    we're married. I don't care so much for the others, but I'd not want Uncle
                    George to feel I had disgraced him." </p>
                <p>"Why, there's no harm in a kiss," pleaded he. </p>
                <p>"Kissing you is&mdash;different," she replied.
                    "It's&mdash;it's&mdash;marriage." </p>
                <p>He understood her innocence that frankly assumed marriage where a sophisticated
                    girl would, in the guilt of designing thoughts, have shrunk in shame from
                    however vaguely suggesting such a thing. He realized to the full his peril. "I'm
                    a damn fool," he said to himself, "to hang about her. But somehow I can't help
                    it&mdash;I can't!" And the truth was, he loved her as much as a boy of his
                    age is capable of loving, and he would have gone on and married her but for the
                    snobbishness smeared on him by the provincialism of the small town and burned in
                    by the toadyism of his fashionable college set. As he looked at her he saw
                    beauty beyond any he had ever seen elsewhere and a sweetness and honesty that
                    made him ashamed before her. "No, I couldn't harm her," he told himself. "I'm
                    not such a dog as that. But there's no harm in loving her and kissing her and
                    making her as happy as it's right to be." </p>
                <p>"Don't be mean, Susan," he begged, tears in his eyes. "If you love me, you'll let
                    me kiss you." </p>
                <p>And she yielded, and the shock of the kiss set both to trembling. It appealed to
                    his vanity, it heightened his own agitations to see how pale she had grown and
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0096" n="73"/> how her rounded bosom rose and
                    fell in the wild tumult of her emotions. "Oh, I can't do without seeing you,"
                    she cried. "And Aunt Fanny has forbidden me." </p>
                <p>"I thought so!" exclaimed he. "I did what I could last night to throw them off
                    the track. If Ruth had only known what I was thinking about all the time. Where
                    were you?" </p>
                <p>"Upstairs&mdash;on the balcony." </p>
                <p>"I felt it," he declared. "And when she sang love songs I could hardly keep from
                    rushing up to you. Susie, we _must_ see each other." </p>
                <p>"I can come here, almost any day." </p>
                <p>"But people'd soon find out&mdash;and they'd say all sorts of things. And
                    your uncle and aunt would hear." </p>
                <p>There was no disputing anything so obvious. </p>
                <p>"Couldn't you come down tonight, after the others are in bed and the house is
                    quiet?" he suggested. </p>
                <p>She hesitated before the deception, though she felt that her family had forfeited
                    the right to control her. But love, being the supreme necessity, conquered. "For
                    a few minutes," she conceded. </p>
                <p>She had been absorbed; but his eyes, kept alert by his conventional soul, had
                    seen several people at a distance observing without seeming to do so. "We must
                    separate," he now said. "You see, Susie, we mustn't be gossiped about. You know
                    how determined they are to keep us apart." </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;yes," she eagerly agreed. "Will you go first, or shall I?" </p>
                <p>"You go&mdash;the way you came. I'll jump the brook down where it's narrow
                    and cut across and into our place by the back way. What time tonight?" </p>
                <p>"Arthur's coming," reflected Susie aloud. "Ruth'll not let him stay late. She'll
                    be sleepy and will go <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0097" n="74"/> straight to bed.
                    About half past ten. If I'm not on the front veranda&mdash;no, the side
                    veranda&mdash;by eleven, you'll know something has prevented." </p>
                <p>"But you'll surely come?" </p>
                <p>"I'll come." And it both thrilled and alarmed him to see how much in earnest she
                    was. But he looked love into her loving eyes and went away, too intoxicated to
                    care whither this adventure was leading him. </p>
                <p>At dinner she felt she was no longer a part of this family. Were they not all
                    pitying and looking down on her in their hearts? She was like a deformed person
                    who has always imagined the consideration he has had was natural and equal, and
                    suddenly discovers that it is pity for his deformity. She now acutely felt her
                    aunt's, her cousin's, dislike; and her uncle's gentleness was not less galling.
                    In her softly rounded youthful face there was revealed definitely for the first
                    time an underlying expression of strength, of what is often confused with its
                    feeble counterfeit, obstinacy&mdash;that power to resist circumstances which
                    makes the unusual and the firm character. The young mobility of her features
                    suggested the easy swaying of the baby sapling in the gentlest breeze.
                    Singularly at variance with it was this expression of tenacity. Such an
                    expression in the face of the young infallibly forecasts an agitated and
                    agitating life. It seemed amazingly out of place in Susan because theretofore
                    she had never been put to the test in any but unnoted trifles and so had given
                    the impression that she was as docile as she was fearful of giving annoyance or
                    pain and indifferent to having her own way. Those who have this temperament of
                    strength encased in gentleness are invariably misunderstood. When they assert
                    themselves, though they are in the particular instance wholly right, they <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0098" n="75"/> are regarded as wholly and
                    outrageously wrong. Life deals hardly with them, punishes them for the mistaken
                    notion of themselves they have through forbearance and gentleness of heart
                    permitted an unobservant world to form. </p>
                <p>Susan spent the afternoon on the balcony before her window, reading and
                    sewing&mdash;or, rather, dreaming over first a book, then a dress. When she
                    entered the dining-room at supper time the others were already seated. She saw
                    instantly that something had occurred&mdash;something ominous for her. Mrs.
                    Warham gave her a penetrating, severe look and lowered her eyes; Ruth was gazing
                    sullenly at her plate. Warham's glance was stern and reproachful. She took her
                    place opposite Ruth, and the meal was eaten in silence. Ruth left the table
                    first. Next Mrs. Warham rose and saying, "Susan, when you've finished, I wish to
                    see you in the sitting-room upstairs," swept in solemn dignity from the room.
                    Susan rose at once to follow. As she was passing her uncle he put out his hand
                    and detained her. </p>
                <p>"I hope it was only a foolish girl's piece of nonsense," said he with an attempt
                    at his wonted kindliness. "And I know it won't occur again. But when your aunt
                    says things you won't like to hear, remember that you brought this on yourself
                    and that she loves you as we all do and is thinking only of your good." </p>
                <p>"What is it, Uncle George?" cried Susan, amazed. "What have I done?" </p>
                <p>Warham looked sternly grieved. "Brownie," he reproached, "you mustn't deceive. Go
                    to your aunt." </p>
                <p>She found her aunt seated stiffly in the living-room, her hands folded upon her
                    stomach. So gradual had been the crucial middle-life change in Fanny that no <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0099" n="76"/> one had noted it. This evening Susan,
                    become morbidly acute, suddenly realized the contrast between the severe,
                    uncertain-tempered aunt of today and the amiable, altogether and always gentle
                    aunt of two years before. </p>
                <p>"What is it, aunt?" she said, feeling as if she were before a stranger and an
                    enemy. </p>
                <p>"The whole town is talking about your disgraceful doings this morning," Ruth's
                    mother replied in a hard voice. </p>
                <p>The color leaped in Susan's cheeks. </p>
                <p>"Yesterday I forbade you to see Sam Wright again. And already you disobey." </p>
                <p>"I did not say I would not see him again," replied Susan. </p>
                <p>"I thought you were an honest, obedient girl," cried Fanny, the high shrill notes
                    in her voice rasping upon the sensitive, the now morbidly sensitive, Susan.
                    "Instead&mdash;you slip away from the house and meet a young
                    man&mdash;and permit him to take _liberties_ with you." </p>
                <p>Susan braced herself. "I did not go to the cemetery to meet him," she replied;
                    and that new or, rather, newly revived tenacity was strong in her eyes, in the
                    set of her sweet mouth. "He saw me on the way and followed. I did let him kiss
                    me&mdash;once. But I had the right to." </p>
                <p>"You have disgraced yourself&mdash;and us all." </p>
                <p>"We are going to be married." </p>
                <p>"I don't want to hear such foolish talk!" cried Mrs. Warham violently. "If you
                    had any sense, you'd know better." </p>
                <p>"He and I do not feel as you do about my mother," said the girl with quiet
                    dignity. </p>
                <p>Mrs. Warham shivered before this fling. "Who told you?" she demanded. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0100" n="77"/>
                <p>"It doesn't matter; I know." </p>
                <p>"Well, miss, since you know, then I can tell you that your uncle and I realize
                    you're going the way your mother went. And the whole town thinks you've gone
                    already. They're all saying, `I told you so! I told you so! Like her mother!'"
                    Mrs. Warham was weeping hysterical tears of fury. "The whole town! And it'll
                    reflect on my Ruth. Oh, you miserable girl! Whatever possessed me to take pity
                    on you!" </p>
                <p>Susan's hands clutched until the nails sunk into the palms. She shut her teeth
                    together, turned to fly. </p>
                <p>"Wait!" commanded Mrs. Warham. "Wait, I tell you!" </p>
                <p>Susan halted in the doorway, but did not turn. </p>
                <p>"Your uncle and I have talked it over." </p>
                <p>"Oh!" cried Susan. </p>
                <p>Mrs. Warham's eyes glistened. "Yes, he has wakened up at last. There's one thing
                    he isn't soft about&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"You've turned him against me!" cried the girl despairingly. </p>
                <p>"You mean _you_ have turned him against you," retorted her aunt. "Anyhow, you
                    can't wheedle him this time. He's as bent as I am. And you must promise us that
                    you won't see Sam again." </p>
                <p>A pause. Then Susan said, "I can't." </p>
                <p>"Then we'll send you away to your Uncle Zeke's. It's quiet out there and you'll
                    have a chance to think things over. And I reckon he'll watch you. He's never
                    forgiven your mother. Now, will you promise?" </p>
                <p>"No," said Susan calmly. "You have wicked thoughts about my mother, and you are
                    being wicked to me&mdash;you and Ruth. Oh, I understand!" </p>
                <p>"Don't you dare stand there and lie that way!" <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0101"/>
                    raved Mrs. Warham. "I'll give you tonight to think about it. If you don't
                    promise, you leave this house. Your uncle has been weak where you were
                    concerned, but this caper of yours has brought him to his senses. We'll not have
                    you a loose character&mdash;and your cousin's life spoiled by it. First
                    thing we know, no respectable man'll marry her, either." </p>
                <p>From between the girl's shut teeth issued a cry. She darted across the hall,
                    locked herself in her room. </p>
            </div1>

                <p> SAM did not wait until Arthur Sinclair left, but, all ardor and impatience,
                    stole in at the Warhams' front gate at ten o'clock. He dropped to the grass
                    behind a clump of lilacs, and to calm his nerves and to make the time pass more
                    quickly, smoked a cigarette, keeping its lighted end carefully hidden in the
                    hollow of his hand. He was not twenty feet away, was seeing and hearing, when
                    Arthur kissed Ruth good night. He laughed to himself. "How disappointed she
                    looked last night when she saw I wasn't going to do that!" What a charmer Susie
                    must be when the thought of her made the idea of kissing as pretty a girl as
                    Ruth uninteresting, almost distasteful! </p>
                <p>Sinclair departed; the lights in parlor and hall went out; presently light
                    appeared through the chinks in some of the second-story shutters. Then followed
                    three-quarters of an hour of increasing tension. The tension would have been
                    even greater had he seen the young lady going leisurely about her preparations
                    for bed. For Ruth was of the orderly, precise women who are created to foster
                    the virtue of patience in those about them. It took her nearly as long to dress
                    for bed as for a party. She did her hair up in curl papers with the utmost care;
                    she washed and rinsed and greased her face and neck and gave them a thorough
                    massage. She shook out and carefully hung or folded or put to air each separate
                    garment. She examined her silk stockings for holes, found one, darned <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0103" n="80"/> it with a neatness rivaling that of a
                    _stoppeur_. She removed from her dressing table and put away in drawers
                    everything that was out of place. She closed each drawer tightly, closed and
                    locked the closets, looked under the bed, turned off the lights over the
                    dressing table. She completed her toilet with a slow washing of her teeth, a
                    long spraying of her throat, and a deliberate, thoroughgoing dripping of boracic
                    acid into each eye to keep and improve its clearness and brilliancy. She sat on
                    the bed, reflected on what she had done, to assure herself that nothing had been
                    omitted. After a slow look around she drew off her bedroom slippers, set them
                    carefully side by side near the head of the bed. She folded her nightgown neatly
                    about her legs, thrust them down into the bed. Again she looked slowly,
                    searchingly, about the room to make absolutely sure she had forgotten nothing,
                    had put everything in perfect order. Once in bed, she hated to get out; yet if
                    she should recall any omission, however slight, she would be unable to sleep
                    until she had corrected it. Finally, sure as fallible humanity can be, she
                    turned out the last light, lay down&mdash;went instantly to sleep. </p>
                <p>It was hardly a quarter of an hour after the vanishing of that last ray when Sam,
                    standing now with heart beating fast and a lump of expectancy, perhaps of
                    trepidation, too, in his throat, saw a figure issue from the front door and move
                    round to the side veranda. He made a detour on the lawn, so as to keep out of
                    view both from house and street, came up to the veranda, called to her softly. </p>
                <p>"Can you get over the rail?" asked she in the same low tone. </p>
                <p>"Let's go back to the summer house," urged he. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0104" n="81"/>
                <p>"No. Come up here," she insisted. "Be careful. The windows above are open." </p>
                <p>He climbed the rail noiselessly and made an impetuous move for her hand. She drew
                    back. "No, Sam dear," she said. "I know it's foolish. But I've an instinct
                    against it&mdash;and we mustn't." </p>
                <p>She spoke so gently that he persisted and pleaded. It was some time before he
                    realized how much firmness there was under her gentleness. She was so afraid of
                    making him cross; yet he also saw that she would withstand at any cost. He
                    placed himself beside her on the wicker lounge, sitting close, his cheek almost
                    against hers, that they might hear each other without speaking above a whisper.
                    After one of those silences which are the peculiar delight of lovers, she drew a
                    long breath and said: "I've got to go away, Sam. I shan't see you again for a
                    long time." </p>
                <p>"They heard about this morning? They're sending you away?" </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;I'm going. They feel that I'm a disgrace and a drag. So I can't
                    stay." </p>
                <p>"But&mdash;you've _got_ to stay!" protested Sam. In wild alarm he suspected
                    she was preparing to make him elope with her&mdash;and he did not know to
                    what length of folly his infatuation might whirl him. "You've no place to go,"
                    he urged. </p>
                <p>"I'll find a place," said she. </p>
                <p>"You mustn't&mdash;you mustn't, Susie! Why, you're only
                    seventeen&mdash;and have no experience." </p>
                <p>"I'll _get_ experience," said she. "Nothing could be so bad as staying here.
                    Can't you see that?" </p>
                <p>He could not. Like so many of the children of the rich, he had no trace of
                    overnice sense of self-respect, having been lying and toadying all his life <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0105" n="82"/> to a father who used the power of his
                    wealth at home no less, rather more, than abroad. But he vaguely realized what
                    delicacy of feeling lay behind her statement of her position; and he did not
                    dare express his real opinion. He returned to the main point. "You've simply got
                    to put up with it for the present, Susie," he insisted. "But, then, of course,
                    you're not serious." </p>
                <p>"Yes. I am going." </p>
                <p>"You'll think it over, and see I'm right, dear." </p>
                <p>"I'm going tonight." </p>
                <p>"Tonight!" he cried. </p>
                <p>"Sh-h!" </p>
                <p>Sam looked apprehensively around. Both breathed softly and listened with
                    straining ears. His exclamation had not been loud, but the silence was profound.
                    "I guess nobody heard," he finally whispered. "You mustn't go, Susie." He caught
                    her hand and held it. "I love you, and I forbid it." </p>
                <p>"I _must_ go, dear," answered she. "I've decided to take the midnight boat for
                    Cincinnati." </p>
                <p>In the half darkness he gazed in stupefaction at her&mdash;this girl of only
                    seventeen calmly resolving upon and planning an adventure so daring, so
                    impossible. As he had been born and bred in that western country where the very
                    children have more independence than the carefully tamed grown people of the
                    East, he ought to have been prepared for almost anything. But his father had
                    undermined his courage and independence; also his year in the East had given him
                    somewhat different ideas of women. Susan's announcement seemed incredible. He
                    was gathering himself for pouring out a fresh protest when it flashed through
                    his mind&mdash;Why not? She would go to Cincinnati. He could follow in a few
                    days or a week&mdash;and then&mdash; </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0106" n="83"/>
                <p>Well, at least they would be free and could have many happy days together. </p>
                <p>"Why, how could you get to Cincinnati?" he said. "You haven't any money." </p>
                <p>"I've a twenty-dollar gold piece Uncle gave me as a keepsake. And I've got
                    seventeen dollars in other money, and several dollars in change," explained she.
                    "I've got two hundred and forty-three dollars and fifty cents in the bank, but I
                    can't get that&mdash;not now. They'll send it to me when I find a place and
                    am settled and let them know." </p>
                <p>"You can't do it, Susie! You can't and you mustn't." </p>
                <p>"If you knew what they said to me! Oh, I _couldn't_ stay, Sam. I've got some of
                    my clothes&mdash;a little bundle behind the front door. As soon as I'm
                    settled I'll let you know." </p>
                <p>A silence, then he, hesitatingly, "Don't you&mdash;do you&mdash;hadn't I
                    better go with you?" </p>
                <p>She thrilled at this generosity, this new proof of love. But she said: "No, I
                    wouldn't let you do that. They'd blame you. And I want them to know it's all my
                    own doing." </p>
                <p>"You're right, Susie," said the young man, relieved and emphatic. "If I went with
                    you, it'd only get both of us into deeper trouble." Again silence, with Sam
                    feeling a kind of awe as he studied the resolute, mysterious profile of the
                    girl, which he could now see clearly. At last he said: "And after you get there,
                    Susie&mdash;what will you do?" </p>
                <p>"Find a boarding house, and then look for a place." </p>
                <p>"What kind of a place?" </p>
                <p>"In a store&mdash;or making dresses&mdash;or any kind of sewing. Or I
                    could do housework." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0107" n="84"/>
                <p>The sex impulse is prolific of generous impulses. He, sitting so close to her and
                    breathing in through his skin the emanations of her young magnetism, was moved
                    to the depths by the picture her words conjured. This beautiful girl, a mere
                    child, born and bred in the lady class, wandering away penniless and alone, to
                    be a prey to the world's buffetings which, severe enough in reality, seem savage
                    beyond endurance to the children of wealth. </p>
                <p>As he pictured it his heart impulsively expanded. It was at his lips to offer to
                    marry her. But his real self&mdash;and one's real self is vastly different
                    from one's impulses&mdash;his real self forbade the words passage. Not even
                    the sex impulse, intoxicating him as it then was, could dethrone snobbish
                    calculation. He was young; so while he did not speak, he felt ashamed of himself
                    for not speaking. He felt that she must be expecting him to speak, that she had
                    the right to expect it. He drew a little away from her, and kept silent. </p>
                <p>"The time will soon pass," said she absently. </p>
                <p>"The time? Then you intend to come back?" </p>
                <p>"I mean the time until you're through college and we can be together." </p>
                <p>She spoke as one speaks of a dream as to which one has never a doubt but that it
                    will come true. It was so preposterous, this idea that he would marry her,
                    especially after she had been a servant or God knows what for several
                    years&mdash;it was so absurd that he burst into a sweat of nervous terror.
                    And he hastily drew further away. </p>
                <p>She felt the change, for she was of those who are born sensitive. But she was far
                    too young and inexperienced to have learned to interpret aright the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0108" n="85"/> subtle warning of the nerves. "You are
                    displeased with me?" she asked timidly. </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;Oh, no, Susie," he stammered. "I&mdash;I was thinking. Do put
                    off going for a day or two. There's no need of hurrying." </p>
                <p>But she felt that by disobeying her aunt and coming down to see him she had
                    forfeited the right to shelter under that roof. "I can't go back," said she.
                    "There's a reason." She would not tell him the reason; it would make him feel as
                    if he were to blame. "When I get a place in Cincinnati," she went on, "I'll
                    write to you." </p>
                <p>"Not here," he objected. "That wouldn't do at all. No, send me a line to the
                    Gibson House in Cincinnati, giving me your address." </p>
                <p>"The Gibson House," she repeated. "I'll not forget that name. Gibson House." </p>
                <p>"Send it as soon as you get a place. I may be in Cincinnati soon. But this is all
                    nonsense. You're not going. You'd be afraid." </p>
                <p>She laughed softly. "You don't know me. Now that I've got to go, I'm glad." </p>
                <p>And he realized that she was not talking to give herself courage, that her words
                    were literally true. This made him admire her, and fear her, too. There must be
                    something wild and unwomanly in her nature. "I guess she inherits it from her
                    mother&mdash;and perhaps her father, whoever he was." Probably she was
                    simply doing a little early what she'd have been sure to do sooner or later, no
                    matter what had happened. On the whole, it was just as well that she was going.
                    "I can take her on East in the fall. As soon as she has a little knowledge of
                    the world she'll not expect me to marry her. She can get something to <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0109" n="86"/> do. I'll help her." And now he felt in
                    conceit with himself again&mdash; felt that he was going to be a good,
                    generous friend to her. </p>
                <p>"Perhaps you'll be better off&mdash;once you get started," said he. </p>
                <p>"I don't see how I could be worse off. What is there here for _me_?" </p>
                <p>He wondered at the good sense of this from a mere child. It was most unlikely
                    that any man of the class she had been brought up in would marry her; and how
                    could she endure marriage with a man of the class in which she might possibly
                    find a husband? As for reputation&mdash; </p>
                <p>She, an illegitimate child, never could have a reputation, at least not so long
                    as she had her looks. After supper, to kill time, he had dropped in at Willett's
                    drug store, where the young fellows loafed and gossiped in the evenings; all the
                    time he was there the conversation had been made up of sly digs and hints about
                    graveyard trysts, each thrust causing the kind of laughter that is the wake of
                    the prurient and the obscene. Yes, she was right. There could be "nothing in it"
                    for her in Sutherland. He was filled with pity for her. "Poor child! What a
                    shame!" There must be something wrong with a world that permitted such
                    iniquities. </p>
                <p>The clock struck twelve. "You must go," she said. "Sometimes the boat comes as
                    early as half-past." And she stood up. </p>
                <p>As he faced her the generous impulse surged again. He caught her in his arms, she
                    not resisting. He kissed her again and again, murmuring disconnected words of
                    endearment and fighting back the offer to marry her. "I mustn't! I mustn't!" he
                    said to <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0110" n="87"/> himself. "What'd become of
                    us?" If his passions had been as virgin, as inexperienced, as hers, no power
                    could have held him from going with her and marrying her. But experience had
                    taught him the abysmal difference between before and after; and he found
                    strength to be sensible, even in the height of his passionate longing for her. </p>
                <p>She clasped her arms about his neck. "Oh, my dear love!" she murmured. "I'd do
                    anything for you. I feel that you love me as I love you." </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;yes." And he pressed his lips to hers. An instant and she drew
                    away, shaking and panting. He tried to clasp her again, but she would not have
                    it. "I can't stand it!" he murmured. "I must go with you&mdash;I must!" </p>
                <p>"No!" she replied. "It wouldn't do unless we were really married." Wistfully,
                    "And we can't be that yet&mdash;can we? There isn't any way?" </p>
                <p>His passion cooled instantly. </p>
                <p>"There isn't any way," he said regretfully. "I'd not dare tell my father." </p>
                <p>"Yes, we must wait till you're of age, and have your education, and are free.
                    Then&mdash;" She drew a long breath, looked at him with a brave smile. The
                    large moon was shining upon them. "We'll think of that, and not let ourselves be
                    unhappy&mdash;won't we?" </p>
                <p>"Yes," he said. "But I must go." </p>
                <p>"I forgot for the minute. Good-by, dearest." She put up her lips. He kissed her,
                    but without passion now. </p>
                <p>"You might go with me as far as the wharf," she suggested. </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;someone might see&mdash;and that would ruin everything. I'd
                    like to&mdash;I'd&mdash;" </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0111" n="88"/>
                <p>"It wouldn't do," she interrupted. "I wouldn't let you come." </p>
                <p>With sudden agitation she kissed him&mdash;he felt that her lips were cold.
                    He pressed her hands&mdash;they, too, were cold. "Good-by, my darling," he
                    murmured, vaulted lightly over the rail and disappeared in the deep shadows of
                    the shrubbery. When he was clear of the grounds he paused to light a cigarette.
                    His hand was shaking so that the match almost dropped from his fingers. "I've
                    been making a damn fool of myself," he said half aloud. "A double damn fool!
                    I've got to stop that talk about marrying, somehow&mdash;or keep away from
                    her. But I can't keep away. I _must_ have her! Why in the devil can't she
                    realize that a man in my position couldn't marry her? If it wasn't for this
                    marrying talk, I'd make her happy. I've simply got to stop this marrying talk.
                    It gets worse and worse." </p>
                <p> Her calmness deceived her into thinking herself perfectly sane and sober,
                    perfectly aware of what she was about. She had left her hat and her bundle
                    behind the door. She put on the hat in the darkness of the hall with steady
                    fingers, took up the well-filled shawl strap and went forth, closing the door
                    behind her. In the morning they would find the door unlocked but that would not
                    cause much talk, as Sutherland people were all rather careless about locking up.
                    They would not knock at the door of her room until noon, perhaps. Then they
                    would find on the pincushion the letter she had written to her uncle, saying
                    good-by and explaining that she had decided to remove forever the taint of her
                    mother and herself from their house and their lives&mdash;a somewhat
                    theatrical letter, <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0112" n="89"/> modeled upon Ouida,
                    whom she thought the greatest writer that had ever lived, Victor Hugo and two or
                    three poets perhaps excepted. </p>
                <p>Her bundle was not light, but she hardly felt it as she moved swiftly through the
                    deserted, moonlit streets toward the river. The wharf boat for the Cincinnati
                    and Louisville mail steamers was anchored at the foot of Pine Street. On the
                    levee before it were piled the boxes, bags, cases, crates, barrels to be loaded
                    upon the "up boat." She was descending the gentle slope toward this mass of
                    freight when her blood tingled at a deep, hoarse, mournful whistle from far
                    away; she knew it was the up boat, rounding the bend and sighting the town. The
                    sound echoed musically back and forth between the Kentucky and the Indiana
                    bluffs, died lingeringly away. Again the whistle boomed, again the dark
                    forest-clad steeps sent the echoes to and fro across the broad silver river. And
                    now she could see the steamer, at the bend&mdash;a dark mass picked out with
                    brilliant dots of light; the big funnels, the two thick pennants of black smoke.
                    And she could hear the faint pleasant stroke of the paddles of the big side
                    wheels upon the water. </p>
                <p>At the wharf boat there had not been a sign of life. But with the dying away of
                    the second whistle lights&mdash;the lights of lanterns&mdash;appeared on
                    the levee close to the water's edge and on the wharf boat itself. And, behind
                    her, the doors of the Sutherland Hotel opened and its office lit up, in
                    preparation for any chance arrivals. She turned abruptly out of the beaten path
                    down the gravel levee, made for the lower and darker end of the wharf boat.
                    There would be Sutherland people going up the river. But they would be more than
                    prompt; everyone came early to boats and <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0113" n="90"
                    /> trains to begin the sweet draught of the excitement of journeying. So she
                    would wait in the darkness and go aboard when the steamer was about to draw in
                    its planks. At the upper end of the wharf boat there was the broad gangway to
                    the levee for passengers and freight; at the lower and dark and deserted end a
                    narrow beam extended from boat to shore, to hold the boat steady. Susan,
                    balancing herself with her bundle, went up to the beam, sat down upon a low
                    stanchion in the darkness where she could see the river. </p>
                <p>Louder and louder grew the regular musical beat of engine and paddle. The
                    searchlight on the forward deck of the _General Lytle_, after peering
                    uncertainly, suspiciously, at the entire levee, and at the river, and at the
                    Kentucky shore, abruptly focused upon the wharf boat. The _General Lytle_ now
                    seemed a blaze of lights&mdash;from lower deck, from saloon deck, from pilot
                    house deck, and forward and astern. A hundred interesting sounds came from
                    her&mdash;tinkling of bells, calls from deck to deck, whistling, creaking of
                    pulleys, lowing of cattle, grunting of swine, plaint of agitated sheep, the
                    resigned cluckings of many chickens. Along the rail of the middle or saloon deck
                    were seated a few passengers who had not yet gone to bed. On the lower deck was
                    a swarm of black roustabouts, their sooty animal faces, their uncannily
                    contrasting white teeth and eyeballs, their strange and varied rags lit up by
                    the torches blazing where a gangplank lay ready for running out. And high and
                    clear in the lovely June night sailed the moon, spreading a faint benign light
                    upon hills and shores and glistening river, upon the graceful, stately mail
                    steamer, now advancing majestically upon the wharf boat. Susan watched all, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0114" n="91"/> saw all, with quick beating heart and
                    quivering interest. It was the first time that her life had been visited by the
                    fascinating sense of event, real event. The tall, proud, impetuous child-woman,
                    standing in the semi-darkness beside her bundle, was about to cast her stake
                    upon the table in a bold game with Destiny. Her eyes shone with the wonderful
                    expression that is seen only when courage gazes into the bright face of danger. </p>
                <p>The steamer touched the edge of the wharf-boat with gentle care; the wharf-boat
                    swayed and groaned. Even as the gangplanks were pushing out, the ragged,
                    fantastic roustabouts, with wild, savage, hilarious cries, ran and jumped and
                    scrambled to the wharf-boat like a band of escaping lunatics and darted down its
                    shore planks to pounce upon the piles of freight. The mate, at the steamer edge
                    to superintend the loading, and the wharf master on the levee beside the freight
                    released each a hoarse torrent of profanity to spur on the yelling, laughing
                    roustabouts, more brute than man. Torches flared; cow and sheep, pig and
                    chicken, uttered each its own cry of dissatisfaction or dismay; the mate and
                    wharf master cursed because it was the custom to curse; the roustabouts rushed
                    ashore empty-handed, came filing back, stooping under their burdens. It was a
                    scene of animation, of excitement, savage, grotesque, fascinating. </p>
                <p>Susan, trembling a little, so tense were her nerves, waited until the last
                    struggling roustabouts were staggering on the boat, until the deep whistle
                    sounded, warning of approaching departure. Then she took up her bundle and put
                    herself in the line of roustabouts, between a half-naked negro, black as coal
                    and bearing a small barrel of beer, and a half-naked mulatto bearing <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0115" n="92"/> a bundle of loud-smelling untanned
                    skins. "Get out of the way, lady!" yelled the mate, eagerly seizing upon a new
                    text for his denunciations. "Get out of the way, you black hellions! Let the
                    lady pass! Look out, lady! You damned sons of hell, what're you about! I'll rip
                    out your bowels&mdash;" </p>
                <p>Susan fled across the deck and darted up the stairs to the saloon. The steamer
                    was all white without except the black metal work. Within&mdash;that is, in
                    the long saloon out of which the cabins opened to right and left and in which
                    the meals were served at extension tables&mdash;there was the palatial
                    splendor of white and gilt. At the forward end near the main entrance was the
                    office. Susan, peering in from the darkness of the deck, saw that the way was
                    clear. The Sutherland passengers had been accommodated. She entered, put her
                    bundle down, faced the clerk behind the desk. </p>
                <p>"Why, howdy, Miss Lenox," said he genially, beginning to twist his narrow,
                    carefully attended blond mustache. "Any of the folks with you?" </p>
                <p>She remembered his face but not his name. She remembered him as one of the "river
                    characters" regarded as outcast by the Christian respectability of Sutherland.
                    But she who could not but be polite to everybody smiled pleasantly, though she
                    did not like his expression as he looked at her. "No, I'm alone," said she. </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;your friends are going to meet you at the wharf in the morning,"
                    said he, content with his own explanation. "Just sign here, please." And, as she
                    wrote, he went on: "I've got one room left. Ain't that lucky? It's a nice one,
                    too. You'll be very comfortable. Everybody at home well? I ain't been in
                    Sutherland for nigh ten years. Every week or so I think I will, and then somehow
                    I don't. <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0116" n="93"/> Here's your
                    key&mdash;number 34 right-hand side, well down toward the far end, yonder.
                    Two dollars, please. Thank you&mdash;exactly right. Hope you sleep well." </p>
                <p>"Thank you," said Susan. </p>
                <p>She turned away with the key which was thrust through one end of a stick about a
                    foot long, to make it too bulky for absent-minded passengers to pocket. She took
                    up her bundle, walked down the long saloon with its gilt decorations, its
                    crystal chandeliers, its double array of small doors, each numbered. The clerk
                    looked after her, admiration of the fine curve of her shoulders, back, and hips
                    written plain upon his insignificant features. And it was a free admiration he
                    would not have dared show had she not been a daughter of
                    illegitimacy&mdash;a girl whose mother's "looseness" raised pleasing if
                    scandalous suggestions and even possibilities in the mind of every man with a
                    carnal eye. And not unnaturally. To think of her was to think of the
                    circumstances surrounding her coming into the world; and to think of those
                    circumstances was to think of immorality. </p>
                <p>Susan, all unconscious of that polluted and impudent gaze, was soon standing
                    before the narrow door numbered 34, as she barely made out, for the lamps in the
                    saloon chandeliers were turned low. She unlocked it, entered the small clean
                    stateroom and deposited her bundle on the floor. With just a glance at her
                    quarters she hurried to the opposite door&mdash;the one giving upon the
                    promenade. She opened it, stepped out, crossed the deserted deck and stood at
                    the rail. </p>
                <p>The _General Lytle_ was drawing slowly away from the wharf-boat. As that part of
                    the promenade happened to be sheltered from the steamer's lights, she was seeing
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0117" n="94"/> the panorama of
                    Sutherland&mdash;its long stretch of shaded waterfront, its cupolas and
                    steeples, the wide leafy streets leading straight from the river by a gentle
                    slope to the base of the dark towering bluffs behind the town&mdash;all
                    sleeping in peace and beauty in the soft light of the moon. That farthest cupola
                    to the left&mdash;it was the Number Two engine house, and the third place
                    from it was her uncle's house. Slowly the steamer, now in mid-stream, drew away
                    from the town. One by one the familiar landmarks&mdash;the packing house,
                    the soap factory, the Geiss brewery, the tall chimney of the pumping station,
                    the shorn top of Reservoir Hill&mdash;slipped ghostlily away to the
                    southwest. The sobs choked up into her throat and the tears rained from her
                    eyes. They all pitied and looked down on her there; still, it had been home the
                    only home she ever had known or ever would know. And until these last few
                    frightful days, how happy she had been there! For the first time she felt
                    desolate, weak, afraid. But not daunted. It is strange to see in strong human
                    character the strength and the weakness, two flat contradictions, existing side
                    by side and making weak what seems so strong and making strong what seems so
                    weak. However, human character is a tangle of inconsistencies, as disorderly and
                    inchoate as the tangible and visible parts of nature. Susan felt weak, but not
                    the kind of weakness that skulks. And there lay the difference, the abysmal
                    difference, between courage and cowardice. Courage has full as much fear as
                    cowardice, often more; but it has a something else that cowardice has not. It
                    trembles and shivers but goes forward. </p>
                <p>Wiping her eyes she went back to her own cabin. She had neglected closing its
                    other door, the one from <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0118" n="95"/> the saloon.
                    The clerk was standing smirking in the doorway. </p>
                <p>"You must be going away for quite some time," said he. And he fixed upon her as
                    greedy and impudent eyes as ever looked from a common face. It was his battle
                    glance. Guileful women, bent on trimming him for anything from a piece of plated
                    jewelry to a saucer of ice cream, had led him to believe that before it walls of
                    virtue tottered and fell like Jericho's before the trumpets of Joshua. </p>
                <p>"It makes me a little homesick to see the old town disappear," hastily explained
                    Susan, recovering herself. The instant anyone was watching, her emotions always
                    hid. </p>
                <p>"Wouldn't you like to sit out on deck a while?" pursued the clerk, bringing up a
                    winning smile to reinforce the fetching stare. </p>
                <p>The idea was attractive, for she did not feel like sleep. It would be fine to sit
                    out in the open, watch the moon and the stars, the mysterious banks gliding
                    swiftly by, and new vistas always widening out ahead. But not with this puny,
                    sandy little "river character," not with anybody that night. "No," replied she.
                    "I think I'll go to bed." </p>
                <p>She had hesitated&mdash;and that was enough to give him encouragement. "Now,
                    do come," he urged. "You don't know how nice it is. And they say I'm mighty good
                    company." </p>
                <p>"No, thanks." Susan nodded a pleasant dismissal. </p>
                <p>The clerk lingered. "Can't I help you in some way? Wouldn't you like me to get
                    you something?" </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;nothing." </p>
                <p>"Going to visit in Cincinnati? I know the town from A to Izzard. It's a lot of
                    fun over the Rhine. <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0119"/> I've had mighty good
                    times there&mdash;the kind a pretty, lively girl like you would take to." </p>
                <p>"When do we get to Cincinnati?" </p>
                <p>"About eight&mdash;maybe half-past seven. Depends on the landings we have to
                    make, and the freight." </p>
                <p>"Then I'll not have much time for sleep," said Susan. "Good night." And no more
                    realizing the coldness of her manner than the reason for his hanging about, she
                    faced him, hand on the door to close it. </p>
                <p>"You ain't a bit friendly," wheedled he. </p>
                <p>"I'm sorry you think so. Good night&mdash;and thank you." And he could not
                    but withdraw his form from the door. She closed it and forgot him. And she did
                    not dream she had passed through one of those perilous adventures incident to a
                    female traveling alone&mdash;adventures that even in the telling frighten
                    ladies whose nervousness for their safety seems to increase in direct proportion
                    to the degree of tranquillity their charms create in the male bosom. She decided
                    it would be unwise regularly to undress; the boat might catch fire or blow up or
                    something. She took off skirt, hat and ties, loosened her waist, and lay upon
                    the lower of the two plain, hard little berths. The throb of the engines, the
                    beat of the huge paddles, made the whole boat tremble and shiver. Faintly up
                    from below came the sound of quarrels over crap-shooting, of banjos and
                    singing&mdash;from the roustabouts amusing themselves between landings. She
                    thought she would not be able to sleep in these novel and exciting surroundings.
                    She had hardly composed herself before she lost consciousness, to sleep on and
                    on dreamlessly, without motion. </p>

                <head> VII</head>
                <p> SHE was awakened by a crash so uproarious that she sat bolt upright before she
                    had her eyes open. Her head struck stunningly against the bottom of the upper
                    berth. This further confused her thoughts. She leaped from the bed, caught up
                    her slippers, reached for her opened-up bundle. The crash was still billowing
                    through the boat; she now recognized it as a great gong sounding for breakfast.
                    She sat down on the bed and rubbed her head and laughed merrily. "I _am_ a
                    greenhorn!" she said. "Another minute and I'd have had the whole boat laughing
                    at me." </p>
                <p>She felt rested and hungry&mdash;ravenously hungry. She tucked in her blouse,
                    washed as well as she could in the tiny bowl on the little washstand. Then
                    before the cloudy watermarked mirror she arranged her scarcely mussed hair. A
                    charming vision of fresh young loveliness, strong, erect, healthy, bright of eye
                    and of cheek, she made as, after a furtive look up and down the saloon, she
                    stepped from her door a very few minutes after the crash of that gong. With much
                    scuffling and bustling the passengers, most of them country people, were
                    hurrying into places at the tables which now had their extension leaves and were
                    covered with coarse white tablecloths and with dishes of nicked stoneware,
                    white, indeed, but shabbily so. But Susan's young eyes were not critical. To her
                    it all seemed fine, with the rich flavor of adventure. A more experienced
                    traveler might have been filled with <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0121" n="98"/>
                    gloomy foreboding by the quality of the odor from the cooking. She found it
                    delightful and sympathized with the unrestrained eagerness of the homely country
                    faces about her, with the children beating their spoons on their empty plates.
                    The colored waiters presently began to stream in, each wearing a soiled white
                    jacket, each bearing aloft a huge tray on which were stacked filled dishes and
                    steaming cups. </p>
                <p>Colored people have a keen instinct for class. One of the waiters happened to
                    note her, advanced bowing and smiling with that good-humored, unservile courtesy
                    which is the peculiar possession of the Americanized colored race. He flourished
                    her into a chair with a "Good morning, miss. It's going to be a fine day." And
                    as soon as she was seated he began to form round her plate a large inclosing arc
                    of side dishes&mdash;fried fish, fried steak, fried egg, fried potatoes,
                    wheat cakes, canned peaches, a cup of coffee. He drew toward her a can of syrup,
                    a pitcher of cream, and a bowl of granulated sugar. </p>
                <p>"Anything else?" said he, with a show of teeth white and sound. </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;nothing. Thank you so much." </p>
                <p>Her smile stimulated him to further courtesies. "Some likes the yeggs biled.
                    Shall I change 'em?" </p>
                <p>"No. I like them this way." She was so hungry that the idea of taking away a
                    certainty on the chance of getting something out of sight and not yet cooked did
                    not attract her. </p>
                <p>"Perhaps&mdash;a little better piece of steak?" </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;this looks fine." Her enthusiasm was not mere politeness. </p>
                <p>"I clean forgot your hot biscuits." And away he darted. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0122" n="99"/>
                <p>When he came back with a heaping plate of hot biscuits, Sally Lunn and cornbread,
                    she was eating as heartily as any of her neighbors. It seemed to her that never
                    had she tasted such grand food as this served in the white and gold saloon with
                    strangeness and interest all about her and the delightful sense of
                    motion&mdash;motion into the fascinating golden unknown. The men at the
                    table were eating with their knives; each had one protecting forearm and hand
                    cast round his arc of small dishes as if to ward off probable attempt at
                    seizure. And they swallowed as if the boat were afire. The women ate more
                    daintily, as became members of the finer sex on public exhibition. They were
                    wearing fingerless net gloves, and their little fingers stood straight out in
                    that gesture which every truly elegant woman deems necessary if the food is to
                    be daintily and artistically conveyed to her lips. The children mussed and
                    gormed themselves, their dishes, the tablecloth. Susan loved it all. Her eyes
                    sparkled. She ate everything, and regretted that lack of capacity made it
                    impossible for her to yield to the entreaties of her waiter that she "have a
                    little more." </p>
                <p>She rose, went into the nearest passageway between saloon and promenade,
                    stealthily took a ten-cent piece from her pocketbook. She called her waiter and
                    gave it to him. She was blushing deeply, frightened lest this the first tip she
                    had ever given or seen given be misunderstood and refused. "I'm so much
                    obliged," she said. "You were very nice." </p>
                <p>The waiter bowed like a prince, always with his simple, friendly smile; the tip
                    disappeared under his apron. "Nobody could help being nice to you, lady." </p>
                <p>She thanked him again and went to the promenade. <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0123"
                        n="100"/> It seemed to her that they had almost arrived. Along shore
                    stretched a continuous line of houses&mdash;pretty houses with gardens.
                    There were electric cars. Nearer the river lay several parallel lines of railway
                    track along which train after train was speeding, some of them short trains of
                    ordinary day coaches, others long trains made up in part of coaches grander and
                    more beautiful than any she had ever seen. She knew they must be the parlor and
                    dining and sleeping cars she had read about. And now they were in the midst of a
                    fleet of steamers and barges, and far ahead loomed the first of Cincinnati's big
                    suspension bridges, pictures of which she had many a time gazed at in wonder.
                    There was a mingling of strange loud noises&mdash;whistles, engines, on the
                    water, on shore; there was a multitude of what seemed to her feverish
                    activities&mdash;she who had not been out of quiet Sutherland since she was
                    a baby too young to note things. </p>
                <p>The river, the shores, grew more and more crowded. Susan's eyes darted from one
                    new object to another; and eagerly though she looked she felt she was missing
                    more than she saw. </p>
                <p>"Why, Susan Lenox!" exclaimed a voice almost in her ear. </p>
                <p>She closed her teeth upon a cry; suddenly she was back from wonderland to
                    herself. She turned to face dumpy, dressy Mrs. Waterbury and her husband with
                    the glossy kinky ringlets and the long wavy mustache. "How do you do?" she
                    stammered. </p>
                <p>"We didn't know you were aboard," said Mrs. Waterbury, a silly, duck-legged woman
                    looking proudly uncomfortable in her bead-trimmed black silk. </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;I'm&mdash;I'm here," confessed Susan. </p>
                <p>"Going to the city to visit?" </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0124" n="101"/>

                <p>"Yes," said Susan. She hesitated, then repeated, "Yes." </p>
                <p>"What elegant breakfasts they do serve on these boats! I suppose your friends'll
                    meet you. But Mort and I'll look after you till they come." </p>
                <p>"Oh, it isn't necessary," protested Susan. The steamer was passing under the
                    bridge. There were cities on both shores&mdash;huge masses of dingy brick,
                    streets filled with motion of every kind&mdash;always motion, incessant
                    motion, and change. "We're about there, aren't we?" she asked. </p>
                <p>"The wharf's up beyond the second bridge&mdash;the Covington Bridge,"
                    explained Waterbury with the air of the old experienced globe-trotter. "There's
                    a third one, further up, but you can't see it for the smoke." And he went on and
                    on, volubly airing his intimate knowledge of the great city which he visited
                    once a year for two or three days to buy goods. He ended with a scornful, "My,
                    but Cincinnati's a dirty place!" </p>
                <p>Dirty it might be, but Susan loved it, dirt and all. The smoke, the grime somehow
                    seemed part of it, one of its charms, one of the things that made it different
                    from, and superior to, monotonous country and country town. She edged away from
                    the Waterburys, hid in her stateroom watching the panorama through the curtained
                    glass of her promenade deck door. She was completely carried away. The city! So,
                    this was the city! And her dreams of travel, of new sights, new faces, were
                    beginning to come true. She forgot herself, forgot what she had left behind,
                    forgot what she was to face. All her power of thought and feeling was used up in
                    absorbing these unfolding wonders. And when the June sun suddenly pierced the
                    heavy <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0125" n="102"/> clouds of fog and smoke, she
                    clasped her hands and gasped, "Lovely! Oh, how lovely!" </p>
                <p>And now the steamer was at the huge wharf-boat, in shape like the one at
                    Sutherland, but in comparative size like the real Noah's Ark beside a toy ark.
                    And from the whole tremendous scene rose an enormous clamor, the stentorian
                    voice of the city. That voice is discordant and terrifying to many. To Susan, on
                    that day, it was the most splendid burst of music. "Awake&mdash;awake!" it
                    cried. "Awake, and _live!_" She opened her door that she might hear it
                    better&mdash;rattle and rumble and roar, shriek of whistle, clang of bell.
                    And the people!&mdash;Thousands on thousands hurrying hither and yon, like
                    bees in a hive. "Awake awake, and live!" </p>
                <p>The noises from the saloon reminded her that the journey was ended, that she must
                    leave the boat. And she did not know where to go&mdash;she and her bundle.
                    She waited until she saw the Waterburys, along with the other passengers, moving
                    up the levee. Then she issued forth&mdash;by the promenade deck door so that
                    she would not pass the office. But at the head of the companionway, in the
                    forward part of the deck, there the clerk stood, looking even pettier and more
                    offensive by daylight. She thought to slip by him. But he stopped stroking his
                    mustache and called out to her, "Haven't your friends come?" </p>
                <p>She frowned, angry in her nervousness. "I shall get on very well," she said
                    curtly. Then she repented, smiled politely, added, "Thank you." </p>
                <p>"I'll put you in a carriage," he offered, hastening down the stairs to join her. </p>
                <p>She did not know what to say or do. She walked silently beside him, he carrying
                    her bundle. They <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0126" n="103"/> crossed the
                    wharf-boat. A line of dilapidated looking carriages was drawn up near the end of
                    the gangplank. The sight of them, the remembrance of what she had heard of the
                    expensiveness of city carriages, nerved her to desperation. "Give me my things,
                    please," she said. "I think I'll walk." </p>
                <p>"Where do you want to go?" </p>
                <p>The question took her breath away. With a quickness that amazed her, her lips
                    uttered, "The Gibson House." </p>
                <p>"Oh! That's a right smart piece. But you can take a car. I'll walk with you to
                    the car. There's a line a couple of squares up that goes almost by the door. You
                    know it isn't far from Fourth Street." </p>
                <p>She was now in a flutter of terror. She went stumbling along beside him, not
                    hearing a word of his voluble and flirtatious talk. They were in the midst of
                    the mad rush and confusion. The noises, no longer mingled but individual, smote
                    savagely upon her ears, startling her, making her look dazedly round as if
                    expecting death to swoop upon her. At the corner of Fourth Street the clerk
                    halted. He was clear out of humor with her, so dumb, so unappreciative.
                    "There'll be a car along soon," said he sourly. </p>
                <p>"You needn't wait," said she timidly. "Thank you again." </p>
                <p>"You can't miss it. Good-by." And he lifted his hat&mdash;"tipped" it,
                    rather&mdash;for he would not have wasted a full lift upon such a female.
                    She gave a gasp of relief when he departed; then a gasp of terror&mdash;for
                    upon the opposite corner stood the Waterburys. The globe-trotter and his wife
                    were so dazed by the city that they did not see her, though in their helpless
                    glancing round they looked straight at her. She hastily <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0127" n="104"/> ran into a drug store on the corner.
                    A young man in shirt sleeves held up by pink garters, and with oily black hair
                    carefully parted and plastered, put down a pestle and mortar and came forward.
                    He had kind brown eyes, but there was something wrong with the lower part of his
                    face. Susan did not dare look to see what it was, lest he should think her
                    unfeeling. He was behind the counter. Susan saw the soda fountain. As if by
                    inspiration, she said, "Some chocolate soda, please." </p>
                <p>"Ice cream?" asked the young man in a peculiar voice, like that of one who has a
                    harelip. </p>
                <p>"Please," said Susan. And then she saw the sign, "Ice Cream, ten cents," and
                    wished she hadn't. </p>
                <p>The young man mixed the soda, put in a liberal helping of ice cream, set it
                    before her with a spoon in it, rested the knuckles of his brown hairy hands on
                    the counter and said: </p>
                <p>"It _is_ hot." </p>
                <p>"Yes, indeed," assented Susan. "I wonder where I could leave my bundle for a
                    while. I'm a stranger and I want to look for a boarding house." </p>
                <p>"You might leave it here with me," said the young man. "That's about our biggest
                    line of trade&mdash;that and postage stamps and telephone&mdash;_and_
                    the directory. " He laughed heartily. Susan did not see why; she did not like
                    the sound, either, for the young man's deformity of lower jaw deformed his
                    laughter as well as his speech. However, she smiled politely and ate and drank
                    her soda slowly. </p>
                <p>"I'll be glad to take care of your bundle," the young man said presently. "Ever
                    been here before?" </p>
                <p>"No," said Susan. "That is, not since I was about four years old." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0128" n="105"/>
                <p>"I was four," said the young man, "when a horse stepped on my mouth in the
                    street." </p>
                <p>"My, how dreadful!" exclaimed Susan. </p>
                <p>"You can see some of the scar yet," the young man assured her, and he pointed to
                    his curiously sunken mouth. "The doctors said it was the most remarkable case of
                    the kind on record," continued he proudly. "That was what led me into the
                    medical line. You don't seem to have your boarding house picked." </p>
                <p>"I was going to look in the papers." </p>
                <p>"That's dangerous&mdash;especially for a young lady. Some of them boarding
                    houses&mdash;well, they're no better'n they ought to be." </p>
                <p>"I don't suppose you know of any?" </p>
                <p>"My aunt keeps one. And she's got a vacancy, it being summer." </p>
                <p>"I'm afraid it'd be too expensive for me," said Susan, to feel her way. </p>
                <p>The young man was much flattered. But he said, "Oh, it ain't so toppy. I think
                    you could make a deal with her for five per." </p>
                <p>Susan looked inquiring. </p>
                <p>"Five a week&mdash;room and board." </p>
                <p>"I might stand that," said Susan reflectively. Then, deciding for complete
                    confidence, "I'm looking for work, too." </p>
                <p>"What line?" </p>
                <p>"Oh, I never tried anything. I thought maybe dressmaking or millinery." </p>
                <p>"Mighty poor season for jobs. The times are bad, anyhow." He was looking at her
                    with kindly curiosity. "If I was you, I'd go back home&mdash;and wait." </p>
                <p>Susan shrank within herself. "I can't do that," she said. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0129" n="106"/>
                <p>The young man thought awhile, then said: "If you should go to my aunt's, you can
                    say Mr. Ellison sent you. No, that ain't me. It's the boss. You see, a
                    respectable boarding house asks for references." </p>
                <p>Susan colored deeply and her gaze slowly sank. "I didn't know that," she
                    murmured. </p>
                <p>"Don't be afraid. Aunt Kate ain't so particular&mdash;leastways, not in
                    summer when things is slow. And I know you're quiet." </p>
                <p>By the time the soda was finished, the young man&mdash;who said his name was
                    Robert Wylie&mdash;had written on the back of Ellison's business card in a
                    Spencerian hand: "Mrs. Kate Wylie, 347 West Sixth Street." He explained that
                    Susan was to walk up two squares and take the car going west; the conductor
                    would let her off at the right place. "You'd better leave your things here,"
                    said Mr. Wylie, holding up the card so that they could admire his penmanship
                    together. "You may not hit it off with Aunt Kate. Don't think you've got to stay
                    there just because of me." </p>
                <p>"I'm sure I'll like it," Susan declared confidently. Her spirits were high; she
                    felt that she was in a strong run of luck. </p>
                <p>Wylie lifted her package over the counter and went to the door with her to point
                    out the direction. "This is Fourth. The next up is Fifth. The next wide one is
                    Sixth&mdash;and you can read it on the lamp-post, too." </p>
                <p>"Isn't that convenient!" exclaimed Susan. "What a lovely city this is!" </p>
                <p>"There's worse," said Mr. Wylie, not to seem vain of his native town. </p>
                <p>They shook hands most friendly and she set out in the direction he had indicated.
                    She was much upset by the many vehicles and the confusion, but she did <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0130" n="107"/> her best to seem at ease and at home.
                    She watched a girl walking ahead of her&mdash;a shopgirl who seemed
                    well-dressed and stylish, especially about the hat and hair. Susan tried to walk
                    like her. "I suppose I look and act greener than I really am," thought she. "But
                    I'll keep my eyes open and catch on." And in this, as in all her thoughts and
                    actions since leaving, she showed confidence not because she was conceited, but
                    because she had not the remotest notion what she was actually attempting. How
                    many of us get credit for courage as we walk unconcerned through perils, or
                    essay and conquer great obstacles, when in truth we are not courageous but
                    simply unaware! As a rule knowledge is power or, rather, a source of power, but
                    there are times when ignorance is a power and knowledge a weakness. If Susan had
                    known, she might perhaps have stayed at home and submitted and, with crushed
                    spirit, might have sunk under the sense of shame and degradation. But she did
                    not know; so Columbus before his sailors or Caesar at the Rubicon among his
                    soldiers did not seem more tranquil than she really was. Wylie, who suspected in
                    the direction of the truth, wondered at her. "She's game, she is," he muttered
                    again and again that morning. "What a nerve for a kid&mdash;and a lady,
                    too!" </p>
                <p>She found the right corner and the right car without further adventure; and the
                    conductor assured her that he would set her down before the very door of the
                    address on the card. It was an open car with few passengers. She took the middle
                    of the long seat nearest the rear platform and looked about her like one in a
                    happy dream. On and on and yet on they went. With every square they passed more
                    people, so it seemed to her, than there were in all Sutherland. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0131" n="108"/> And what huge stores! And what
                    wonderful displays of things to wear! Where would the people be found to buy
                    such quantities, and where would they get the money to pay? How many restaurants
                    and saloons! Why, everybody must be eating and drinking all the time. And at
                    each corner she looked up and down the cross streets, and there were more and
                    ever more magnificent buildings, throngs upon throngs of people. Was there no
                    end to it? This was Sixth Street, still Sixth Street, as she saw at the corner
                    lamp-posts. Then there must be five more such streets between this and the
                    river; and she could see, up the cross streets, that the city was even vaster in
                    the direction of the hills. And there were all these cross streets! It was
                    stupefying&mdash;overwhelming&mdash;incredible. </p>
                <p>She began to be nervous, they were going so far. She glanced anxiously at the
                    conductor. He was watching her interestedly, understood her glance, answered it
                    with a reassuring nod. He called out: </p>
                <p>"I'm looking out for you, miss. I've got you on my mind. Don't you fret." </p>
                <p>She gave him a bright smile of relief. They were passing through a double row of
                    what seemed to her stately residences, and there were few people on the
                    sidewalks. The air, too, was clearer, though the walls were grimy and also the
                    grass in the occasional tiny front yards. But the curtains at the windows looked
                    clean and fresh, and so did the better class of people among those on the
                    sidewalk. It delighted her to see so many well-dressed women, wearing their
                    clothes with an air which she told herself she must acquire. She was startled by
                    the conductor's calling out: </p>
                <p>"Now, miss!" </p>
                <p>She rose as he rang the bell and was ready to get <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0132" n="109"/> off when the car stopped, for she was
                    eager to cause him as little trouble as possible. </p>
                <p>"The house is right straight before you," said the conductor. "The number's in
                    the transom." </p>
                <p>She thanked him, descended, was on the sidewalk before Mrs. Wylie's. She looked
                    at the house and her heart sank. She thought of the small sum in her purse; it
                    was most unlikely that such a house as this would harbor her. For here was a
                    grand stone stairway ascending to a deep stone portico, and within it great
                    doors, bigger than those of the Wright mansion, the palace of Sutherland.
                    However, she recalled the humble appearance and mode of speech of her friend the
                    drug clerk and plucked up the courage to ascend and to ring. </p>
                <p>A slattern, colored maid opened the door. At the first glance within, at the
                    first whiff of the interior air, Susan felt more at ease. For she was seeing
                    what even her bedazzled eyes recognized as cheap dowdiness, and the smell that
                    assailed her nostrils was that of a house badly and poorly kept&mdash;the
                    smell of cheap food and bad butter cooking, of cats, of undusted rooms, of
                    various unrecognizable kinds of staleness. She stood in the center of the big
                    dingy parlor, gazing round at the grimed chromos until Mrs. Wylie
                    entered&mdash;a thin middle-aged woman with small brown eyes set wide apart,
                    a perpetual frown, and a chin so long and so projected that she was almost
                    jimber-jawed. While Susan explained stammeringly what she had come for, Mrs.
                    Wylie eyed her with increasing disfavor. When Susan had finished, she unlocked
                    her lips for the first time to say: </p>
                <p>"The room's took." </p>
                <p>"Oh!" cried Susan in dismay. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0133" n="110"/>
                <p>The telephone rang in the back parlor. Mrs. Wylie excused herself to answer.
                    After a few words she closed the doors between. She was gone fully five minutes;
                    to Susan it seemed an hour. She came back, saying: </p>
                <p>"I've been talking to my nephew. He called up. Well, I reckon you can have the
                    room. It ain't my custom to take in ladies as young as you. But you seem to be
                    all right. Your parents allowed you to come?" </p>
                <p>"I haven't any," replied Susan. "I'm here to find a place and support myself." </p>
                <p>Mrs. Wylie continued to eye her dubiously. "Well, I have no wish to pry into your
                    affairs. `Mind your own business,' that's my rule." She spoke with defiance, as
                    if the contrary were being asserted by some invisible person who might appear
                    and gain hearing and belief. She went on: "If Mr. Ellison wants it, why I
                    suppose it's all right. But you can't stay out later'n ten o'clock." </p>
                <p>"I shan't go out at all of nights," said Susan eagerly. </p>
                <p>"You _look_ quiet," said Mrs. Wylie, with the air of adding that appearances were
                    rarely other than deceptive. </p>
                <p>"Oh, I _am_ quiet," declared Susan. It puzzled her, this recurrence of the
                    suggestion of noisiness. </p>
                <p>"I can't allow much company&mdash;none in your room." </p>
                <p>"There won't be any company." She blushed deeply. "That is, a&mdash;a young
                    man from our town&mdash;he may call once. But he'll be off for the East
                    right away." </p>
                <p>Mrs. Wylie reflected on this, Susan the while standing uneasily, dreading lest
                    decision would be against her. Finally Mrs. Wylie said: </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0134" n="111"/>
                <p>"Robert says you want the five-dollar room. I'll show it to you." </p>
                <p>They ascended two flights through increasing shabbiness. On the third floor at
                    the rear was a room&mdash;a mere continuation of the narrow hall,
                    partitioned off. It contained a small folding bed, a small table, a tiny bureau,
                    a washstand hardly as large as that in the cabin on the boat, a row of hooks
                    with a curtain of flowered chintz before them, a kitchen chair, a chromo of
                    "Awake and Asleep," a torn and dirty rag carpet. The odor of the room, stale,
                    damp, verging on moldy, seemed the fitting exhalation from such an assemblage of
                    forbidding objects. </p>
                <p>"It's a nice, comfortable room," said Mrs. Wylie aggressively. "I couldn't afford
                    to give it and two meals for five dollars except till the first of September.
                    After that it's eight." </p>
                <p>"I'll be glad to stay, if you'll let me," said Susan. Mrs. Wylie's suspicion, so
                    plain in those repellent eyes, took all the courage out of her. The great
                    adventure seemed rapidly to be losing its charms. She could not think of herself
                    as content or anything but sad and depressed in such surroundings as these. How
                    much better it would be if she could live out in the open, out where it was
                    attractive! </p>
                <p>"I suppose you've got some baggage," said Mrs. Wylie, as if she rather expected
                    to hear that she had not. </p>
                <p>"I left it at the drug store," explained Susan. </p>
                <p>"Your trunk?" </p>
                <p>Susan started nervously at that explosive exclamation. "I&mdash;I haven't got
                    a trunk&mdash;only a few things in a shawl strap." </p>
                <p>"Well, I never!" </p>
                <p>Mrs. Wylie tossed her head, clucked her tongue disgustedly <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0135" n="112"/> against the roof of her mouth. "But I
                    suppose if Mr. Ellison says so, why you can stay." </p>
                <p>"Thank you," said Susan humbly. Even if it would not have been basest ingratitude
                    to betray her friend, Mr. Wylie, still she would not have had the courage to
                    confess the truth about Mr. Ellison and so get herself ordered into the street.
                    "I&mdash;I think I'll go for my things." </p>
                <p>"The custom is to pay in advance," said Mrs. Wylie sharply. </p>
                <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;of course," stammered Susan. </p>
                <p>She seated herself on the wooden chair and opened out her purse. She found the
                    five among her few bills, extended it with trembling fingers toward Mrs. Wylie.
                    At the same time she lifted her eyes. The woman's expression as she bored into
                    the pocketbook terrified her. Never before had she seen the savage greediness
                    that is bred in the city among the people who fight against fearful odds to
                    maintain their respectability and to save themselves from the ever threatened
                    drop to the despised working class. </p>
                <p>"Thank you, " said Mrs. Wylie, taking the bill as if she were conferring a favor
                    upon Susan. "I make everybody pay promptly. The first of the week or out they
                    go! I used to be easy and I came near going down." </p>
                <p>"Oh, I shouldn't stay a minute if I couldn't pay," said the girl. "I'm going to
                    look for something right away." </p>
                <p>"Well, I don't want to discourage you, but there's a great many out of work.
                    Still, I suppose you'll be able to wheedle some man into giving you a job. But I
                    warn you I'm very particular about morals. If I see any signs&mdash;" Mrs.
                    Wylie did not finish her sentence. <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0136" n="113"/>
                    Any words would have been weaker than her look. </p>
                <p>Susan colored and trembled. Not at the poisonous hint as to how money could be
                    got to keep on paying for that room, for the hint passed wide of Susan. She was
                    agitated by the thought: if Mrs. Wylie should learn that she was not
                    respectable! If Mrs. Wylie should learn that she was nameless&mdash;was born
                    in disgrace so deep that, no matter how good she might be, she would yet be
                    classed with the wicked. </p>
                <p>"I'm down like a thousand of brick on any woman that is at all loose with the
                    men," continued the landlady. "I never could understand how any woman could so
                    far forget herself." And the woman whom the men had all her life been helping to
                    their uttermost not to "forget herself" looked sharp suspicion and envy at
                    Susan, the lovely. Why are women of the Mrs. Wylie sort so swift to suspect? Can
                    it be that in some secret chamber of their never assailed hearts there lurks a
                    longing&mdash;a feeling as to what they would do if they had the chance?
                    Mrs. Wylie continued, "I hope you have strict Christian principles?" </p>
                <p>"I was brought up Presbyterian," said Susan anxiously. She was far from sure that
                    in Cincinnati and by its Mrs. Wylies Presbyterian would be regarded as
                    Christian. </p>
                <p>"There's your kind of a church a few squares from here," was all Mrs. Wylie
                    deigned to reply. Susan suspected a sneer at Presbyterianism in her accent. </p>
                <p>"That'll be nice," she murmured. She was eager to escape. "I'll go for my
                    things." </p>
                <p>"You can walk down and take the Fourth Street car," suggested her landlady. "Then
                    you can watch out and not miss the store. The conductors are very impudent and
                    forgetful." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0137" n="114"/>
                <p>Susan escaped from the house as speedily as her flying feet would take her down
                    the two flights. In the street once more, her spirits rose. She went south to
                    Fourth Street, decided to walk instead of taking a car. She now found herself in
                    much more impressive surroundings than before, and realized that Sixth Street
                    was really one of the minor streets. The further uptown she went, the more
                    excited she became. After the district of stately mansions with wonderful
                    carriages driving up and away and women dressed like those in the illustrated
                    story papers, came splendid shops and hotels, finer than Susan had believed
                    there were anywhere in the world. And most of the people&mdash;the crowds on
                    crowds of people!&mdash;looked prosperous and cheerful and so delightfully
                    citified! She wondered why so many of the men stared at her. She assumed it must
                    be something rural in her appearance though that ought to have set the women to
                    staring, too. But she thought little about this, so absorbed was she in seeing
                    all the new things. She walked slowly, pausing to inspect the shop
                    windows&mdash;the gorgeous dresses and hats and jewelry, the thousand costly
                    things scattered in careless profusion. And the crowds! How secure she felt
                    among these multitudes of strangers, not one of them knowing or suspecting her
                    secret of shame! She no longer had the sense of being outcast, branded. </p>
                <p>When she had gone so far that it seemed to her she certainly must have missed the
                    drug store, carefully though she had inspected each corner as she went, she
                    decided that she must stop someone of this hurrying throng and inquire the way.
                    While she was still screwing her courage to this boldness, she espied the sign
                    and hastened joyfully across the street. She and Wylie <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0138"/> welcomed each other like old friends. He was
                    delighted when he learned that she had taken the room. </p>
                <p>"You won't mind Aunt Kate after a while," said he. "She's sour and nosey, but
                    she's honest and respectable&mdash;and that's the main thing just now with
                    you. And I think you'll get a job all right. Aunt Kate's got a lady friend
                    that's head saleslady at Shillito's. She'll know of something." </p>
                <p>Wylie was so kind and so hopeful that Susan felt already settled. As soon as
                    customers came in, she took her parcel and went, Wylie saying, "I'll drop round
                    after supper and see how things are getting on." She took the Sixth Street car
                    back, and felt like an old resident. She was critical of Sixth Street now, and
                    of the women she had been admiring there less than two hours
                    before&mdash;critical of their manners and of their dress. The exterior of
                    the boarding house no longer awed her. She was getting a point of
                    view&mdash;as she proudly realized. By the time Sam came&mdash;and
                    surely that wouldn't be many days&mdash;she would be quite transformed. </p>
                <p>She mounted the steps and was about to ring when Mrs. Wylie herself, with stormy
                    brow and snapping eyes, opened the door. "Go into the parlor," she jerked out
                    from between her unpleasant-looking receding teeth. </p>
                <p>Susan gave her a glance of frightened wonder and obeyed. </p>

                <head> VIII</head>
                <p> AT the threshold her bundles dropped to the floor and all color fled from her
                    face. Before her stood her Uncle George and Sam Wright and his father. The two
                    elderly men were glowering at her; Sam, white as his shirt and limp, was hanging
                    his head. </p>
                <p>"So, miss!&mdash;You've got back, eh?" cried her uncle in a tone she would
                    not have believed could come from him. </p>
                <p>As quickly as fear had seized her she now shook it off. "Yes, Uncle," she said
                    calmly, meeting his angry eyes without flinching. And back came that expression
                    of resolution&mdash;of stubbornness we call it when it is the flag of
                    opposition to _our_ will. </p>
                <p>"What'd have become of you," demanded her uncle, "if I hadn't found out early
                    this morning, and got after Sam here and choked the truth out of him?" </p>
                <p>Susan gazed at Sam; but he was such a pitiful figure, so mean and frightened,
                    that she glanced quickly back to her uncle. She said: </p>
                <p>"But he didn't know where I was." </p>
                <p>"Don't lie to me," cried Warham. "It won't do you any good, any more than his
                    lying kept us from finding you. We came on the train and saw the Waterburys in
                    the street and they'd seen you go into the drug store. We'd have caught you
                    there if we'd been a few minutes sooner, but we drove, and got here in time.
                    Now, tell me, Susan"&mdash;and his voice was cruelly harsh&mdash;"all
                    about what's been going on between you and Sam." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0140" n="117"/>
                <p>She gazed fearlessly and was silent. </p>
                <p>"Speak up!" commanded Sam's father. </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;and no lies," said her uncle. </p>
                <p>"I don't know what you mean," Susan at last answered&mdash;truthfully enough,
                    yet to gain time, too. </p>
                <p>"You can't play that game any longer," cried Warham. "You did make a fool of me,
                    but my eyes are open. Your aunt's right about you." </p>
                <p>"Oh, Uncle George!" said the girl, a sob in her voice. </p>
                <p>But he gazed pitilessly&mdash;gazed at the woman he was now abhorring as the
                    treacherous, fallen, unsexed daughter of fallen Lorella. "Speak out. Crying
                    won't help you. What have you and this fellow been up to? You disgrace!" </p>
                <p>Susan shrank and shivered, but answered steadfastly, "That's between him and me,
                    Uncle." </p>
                <p>Warham gave a snort of fury, turned to the elder Wright. "You see, Wright," cried
                    he. "It's as my wife and I told you. Your boy's lying. We'll send the landlady
                    out for a preacher and marry them." </p>
                <p>"Hold on, George," objected Wright soothingly. "I agreed to that only if there'd
                    been something wrong. I'm not satisfied yet." He turned to Susan, said in his
                    gruff, blunt way: </p>
                <p>"Susan, have you been loose with my boy here?" </p>
                <p>"Loose?" said Susan wonderingly. </p>
                <p>Sam roused himself. "Tell them it isn't so, Susan," he pleaded, and his voice was
                    little better than a whine of terror. "Your uncle's going to kill me and my
                    father'll kick me out." </p>
                <p>Susan's heart grew sick as she looked at him&mdash;looked furtively, for she
                    was ashamed to see him so abject. "If you mean did I let him kiss me," she said
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0141" n="118"/> to Mr. Wright, "why, I did. We
                    kissed several times. But we had the right to. We were engaged." </p>
                <p>Sam turned on his father in an agony of terror. "That isn't true!" he cried. "I
                    swear it isn't, father. We aren't engaged. I only made love to her a little, as
                    a fellow does to lots of girls." </p>
                <p>Susan looked at him with wide, horrified eyes. "Sam!" she exclaimed breathlessly.
                    "Sam!" </p>
                <p>Sam's eyes dropped, but he managed to turn his face in her direction. The
                    situation was too serious for him; he did not dare to indulge in such vanities
                    as manhood or manly appearance. "That's the truth, Susan," he said sullenly.
                    "_You_ talked a lot about marrying but _I_ never thought of such a thing." </p>
                <p>"But&mdash;you said&mdash;you loved me." </p>
                <p>"I didn't mean anything by it." </p>
                <p>There fell a silence that was interrupted by Mr. Wright. "You see there's nothing
                    in it, Warham. I'll take my boy and go." </p>
                <p>"Not by a damn sight!" cried Warham. "He's got to marry her. Susan, did Sam
                    promise to marry you?" </p>
                <p>"When he got through college," replied Susan. </p>
                <p>"I thought so! And he persuaded you to run away." </p>
                <p>"No," said Susan. "He&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"I say yes," stormed her uncle. "Don't lie!" </p>
                <p>"Warham! Warham!" remonstrated Mr. Wright. "Don't browbeat the girl." </p>
                <p>"He begged me not to go," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"You lying fool!" shouted her uncle. Then to Wright, "If he did ask her to stay
                    it was because he was afraid it would all come out&mdash;just as it has." </p>
                <p>"I never promised to marry her!" whined Sam. "Honest to God, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0142" n="119"/> father, I never did. Honest to God,
                    Mr. Warham! You know that's so, Susan. It was you that did all the marrying
                    talk." </p>
                <p>"Yes," she said slowly. "Yes, I believe it was." She looked dazedly at the three
                    men. "I supposed he meant marriage because&mdash;" her voice faltered, but
                    she steadied it and went on&mdash;"because we loved each other." </p>
                <p>"I knew it!" cried her uncle. "You hear, Wright? She admits he betrayed her." </p>
                <p>Susan remembered the horrible part of her cousin's sex revelations. "Oh, no!" she
                    cried. "I wouldn't have let him do that&mdash;even if he had wanted to.
                    No&mdash;not even if we'd been married." </p>
                <p>"You see, Warham!" cried Mr. Wright, in triumph. </p>
                <p>"I see a liar!" was Warham's furious answer. "She's trying to defend him and make
                    out a case for herself." </p>
                <p>"I am telling the truth," said Susan. </p>
                <p>Warham gazed unbelievingly at her, speechless with fury. Mr. Wright took his silk
                    hat from the corer of the piano. "I'm satisfied they're innocent," said he. "So
                    I'll take my boy and go." </p>
                <p>"Not if I know it!" retorted Warham. "He's got to marry her." </p>
                <p>"But the girl says she's pure, says he never spoke of marriage, says he begged
                    her not to run away. Be reasonable, Warham." </p>
                <p>"For a good Christian," sneered he at Wright, "you're mighty easily convinced by
                    a flimsy lie. In your heart you know the boy has wronged her and that she's
                    shielding him, just as&mdash;" There Warham checked himself; it would be
                    anything but timely to remind Wright of the character of the girl's mother. </p>
                <p>"I'll admit," said Mr. Wright smoothly, "that I wasn't overanxious for my boy's
                    marriage with a girl <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0143" n="120"/> whose mother
                    was&mdash;unfortunate. But if your charge had been true, Warham, I'd have
                    made the boy do her justice, she being only seventeen. Come, Sam." </p>
                <p>Sam slunk toward the door. Warham stared fiercely at the elder Wright. "And you
                    call yourself a Christian!" he sneered. </p>
                <p>At the door&mdash;Sam had already disappeared&mdash;Mr. Wright paused to
                    say, "I'm going to give Sam a discipline he'll remember. The girl's only been
                    foolish. Don't be harsh with her." </p>
                <p>"You damned hypocrite!" shouted Warham. "I might have known what to expect from a
                    man who cut the wages of his hands to pay his church subscription." </p>
                <p>But Wright was far too crafty to be drawn. He went on pushing Sam before him. </p>
                <p>As the outer door closed behind them Mrs. Wylie appeared. "I want you both to get
                    out of my house as quick as you can," she snapped. "My boarders'll be coming to
                    dinner in a few minutes." </p>
                <p>Warham took his straw hat from the floor beside the chair behind him. "I've
                    nothing to do with this girl here. Good day, madam." And he strode out of the
                    house, slamming the door behind him. </p>
                <p>Mrs. Wylie looked at Susan with storming face and bosom. Susan did not see. She
                    was gazing into space, her face blanched. "Clear out!" cried Mrs. Wylie. And she
                    ran to the outer door and opened it. "How dare you come into a respectable
                    house!" She wished to be so wildly angry that she would forget the five dollars
                    which she, as a professing Christian in full church standing, would have to pay
                    back if she remembered. "Clear out this minute!" she cried shrilly. "If you
                    don't, I'll throw your bundle into the street and you after it." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0144" n="121"/>
                <p>Susan took up the bundle mechanically, slowly went out on the stoop. The door
                    closed with a slam behind her. She descended the steps, walked a few yards up
                    the street, paused at the edge of the curb and looked dazedly about. Her uncle
                    stood beside her. "Now where are you going?" he said roughly. </p>
                <p>Susan shook her head. </p>
                <p>"I suppose," he went on, "I've got to look after you. You shan't disgrace my
                    daughter any further." </p>
                <p>Susan simply looked at him, her eyes unseeing, her brain swept clean of thought
                    by the cyclone that had destroyed all her dreams and hopes. She was not
                    horrified by his accusations; such things had little meaning for one practically
                    in complete ignorance of sex relations. Besides, the miserable fiasco of her
                    romantic love left her with a feeling of abasement, of degradation little
                    different from that which overwhelms a woman who believes her virtue is her all
                    and finds herself betrayed and abandoned. She now felt indeed the outcast,
                    looked down upon by all the world. </p>
                <p>"If you hadn't lied," he fumed on, "you'd have been his wife and a respectable
                    woman." </p>
                <p>The girl shivered. </p>
                <p>"Instead, you're a disgrace. Everybody in Sutherland'll know you've gone the way
                    your mother went." </p>
                <p>"Go away," said the girl piteously. "Let me alone." </p>
                <p>"Alone? What will become of you?" He addressed the question to himself, not to
                    her. </p>
                <p>"It doesn't matter," was her reply in a dreary tone. "I've been betrayed, as my
                    mother was. It doesn't matter what&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"I knew it!" cried Warham, with no notion of what the girl meant by the word
                    "betrayed." "Why didn't you confess the truth while he was here and his father
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0145" n="122"/> was ready to marry him to you? I
                    knew you'd been loose with him, as your Aunt Fanny said." </p>
                <p>"But I wasn't," said Susan. "I wouldn't do such a thing." </p>
                <p>"There you go, lying again!" </p>
                <p>"It doesn't matter," said she. "All I want is for you to go away." </p>
                <p>"You do?" sneered he. "And then what? I've got to think of Ruthie." He snatched
                    the bundle from her hand. "Come on! I must do all I can to keep the disgrace to
                    my family down. As for you, you don't deserve anything but the gutter, where
                    you'd sink if I left you. Your aunt's right. You're rotten. You were born
                    rotten. You're your mother's own brat." </p>
                <p>"Yes, I am," she cried. "And I'm proud of it!" She turned from him, was walking
                    rapidly away. </p>
                <p>"Come with me!" ordered Warham, following and seizing her by the arm. </p>
                <p>"No," said Susan, wrenching herself free. </p>
                <p>"Then I'll call a policeman and have you locked up." </p>
                <p>Uncle and niece stood regarding each other, hatred and contempt in his gaze,
                    hatred and fear in hers. </p>
                <p>"You're a child in law&mdash;though, God knows, you're anything but a child
                    in fact. Come along with me. You've got to. I'm going to see that you're put out
                    of harm's way." </p>
                <p>"You wouldn't take me back to Sutherland!" she cried. </p>
                <p>He laughed savagely. "I guess not! You'll not show your face there
                    again&mdash;though I've no doubt you'd be brazen enough to brass it out.
                    No&mdash;you can't pollute my home again." </p>
                <p>"I can't go back to Sutherland!" </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0146" n="123"/>
                <p>"You shan't, I say. You ran off because you had disgraced yourself." </p>
                <p>"No!" cried Susan. "No!" </p>
                <p>"Don't lie to me! Don't speak to me. I'll see what I can do to hide this mess.
                    Come along!" </p>
                <p>Susan looked helplessly round the street, saw nothing, not even eager, curious
                    faces pressed against many a window pane, saw only a desolate waste. Then she
                    walked along beside her uncle, both of them silent, he carrying her bundle, she
                    tightly clutching her little purse. </p>
                <p> Perhaps the most amazing, the most stunning, of all the blows fate had thus
                    suddenly showered upon her was this transformation of her uncle from gentleness
                    to ferocity. But many a far older and far wiser woman than seventeen-year-old
                    Susan has failed to understand how it is with the man who does not regard woman
                    as a fellow human being. To such she is either an object of adoration, a
                    quintessence of purity and innocence, or less than the dust, sheer filth.
                    Warham's anger was no gust. He was simply the average man of small intelligence,
                    great vanity, and abject snobbishness or terror of public opinion. There could
                    be but one reason for the flight of Lorella's daughter&mdash;rottenness. The
                    only point to consider now was how to save the imperiled family standing, how to
                    protect his own daughter, whom his good nature and his wife's weakness had thus
                    endangered. The one thing that could have appeased his hatred of Susan would
                    have been her marriage to Sam Wright. Then he would have&mdash;not, indeed,
                    forgiven or reinstated her&mdash;but tolerated her. It is the dominance of
                    such ideas as his that makes for woman the slavery she discovers beneath her
                    queenly <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0147" n="124"/> sway if she happens to do
                    something deeply displeasing to her masculine subject and adorer. </p>
                <p>They went to the Central Station. The O. and M. express which connected with the
                    train on the branch line to Sutherland would not leave until a quarter past two.
                    It was only a few minutes past one. Warham led the way into the station
                    restaurant; with a curt nod he indicated a seat at one of the small tables, and
                    dropped into the opposite seat. He ordered beefsteak and fried potatoes, coffee
                    and apple pie. </p>
                <p>"Sit still!" he said to her roughly and rose to go out to buy a paper. </p>
                <p>The girl sat with her hands in her lap and her eyes upon them. She looked
                    utterly, pitifully tired. A moment and he came back to resume his seat and read
                    the paper. When the waiter flopped down the steak and the dish of greasily fried
                    potatoes before his plate, he stuffed the paper in his pocket, cut a slice of
                    the steak and put it on the plate. The waiter noisily exchanged it for the empty
                    plate before Susan. Warham cut two slices of the steak for himself, took a
                    liberal helping of the potatoes, pushed the dish toward her. </p>
                <p>"Do you want the coffee now, or with the pie?" asked the waiter. </p>
                <p>"Now," said Warham. </p>
                <p>"Coffee for the young lady, too?" </p>
                <p>Warham scowled at her. "Coffee?" he demanded. </p>
                <p>She did not answer; she did not hear. </p>
                <p>"Yes, she wants coffee," said Warham. "Hustle it!" </p>
                <p>"Yes, sir." And the waiter bustled away with a great deal of motion that created
                    a deceptive impression of speed. Warham was helping himself to steak again when
                    the coffee came a suspicious-looking liquid diffusing an odor of staleness
                    reheated again and again, <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0148" n="125"/> an under
                    odor of metal pot not too frequently scoured. </p>
                <p>Warham glanced at Susan's plate. She had not disturbed the knife and fork on
                    either side of it. "Eat!" he commanded. And when she gave no sign of having
                    heard, he repeatedly sharply, "Eat, I tell you." </p>
                <p>She started, nervously took up the knife and fork, cut a morsel off the slice of
                    steak. When she lifted it to her lips, she suddenly put it back in the plate. "I
                    can't," she said. </p>
                <p>"You've got to," ordered he. "I won't have you acting this way." </p>
                <p>"I can't," she repeated monotonously. "I feel sick." Nature had luckily so made
                    her that it was impossible for her to swallow when her nerves were upset or when
                    she was tired; thus, she would not have the physical woes that aggravate and
                    prolong mental disturbance if food is taken at times when it instantly turns to
                    poison. </p>
                <p>He repeated his order in a still more savage tone. She put her elbows on the
                    table, rested her head wearily upon her hands, shook her head. He desisted. </p>
                <p>When he had eaten all of the steak, except the fat and the gristly tail, and
                    nearly all the potatoes, the waiter took the used dishes away and brought two
                    generous slices of apple pie and set down one before each. With the pie went a
                    cube of American cream or "rat-trap" cheese. Warham ate his own pie and cheese;
                    then, as she had not touched hers, he reached for it and ate it also. Now he was
                    watching the clock and, between liftings of laden fork to his mouth, verifying
                    the clock's opinion of the hour by his own watch. He called for the bill, paid
                    it, gave the waiter five cents&mdash;a concession to the tipping custom of
                    the effete city which, judging by the waiter's expression, might as well not
                    have been made. Still, Warham had not made <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0149"
                        n="126"/> it with an idea of promoting good feeling between himself and the
                    waiter, but simply to show that he knew the city and its ways. He took up the
                    shawl strap, said, "Come on" in the voice which he deemed worthy of the fallen
                    creature he must, through Christian duty and worldly prudence, for the time
                    associate with. She rose and followed him to the ticket office. He had the
                    return half of his own ticket. When she heard him ask for a ticket to North
                    Sutherland she shivered. She knew that her destination was his brother Zeke's
                    farm. </p>
                <p>From Cincinnati to North Vernon, where they were to change cars, he sat beside
                    her without speech. At North Vernon, where they had to occupy a bench outside
                    the squat and squalid station for nearly two hours, he sat beside her without
                    speech. And without a single word on either side they journeyed in the poking,
                    no-sooner-well-started-than-stopping accommodation train southbound. Several
                    Sutherland people were aboard. He nodded surlily to those who spoke to him. He
                    read an Indianapolis paper which he had bought at North Vernon. All the way she
                    gazed unseeingly out over the fair June landscape of rolling or hilly fields
                    ripening in the sun. </p>
                <p>At North Sutherland he bade her follow him to a dilapidated barn a few yards from
                    the railway tracks, where was displayed a homemade sign&mdash;"V. Goslin.
                    Livery and Sale Stable." There was dickering and a final compromise on four
                    dollars where the proprieter had demanded five and Warham had declared two fifty
                    liberal. A surrey was hitched with two horses. Warham opened the awkward door to
                    the rear seat and ordered Susan to jump in. She obeyed; he put the bundle on the
                    floor beside her. He sat with the driver <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0150"
                        n="127"/> &mdash;the proprietor himself. The horses set off at a round
                    pace over the smooth turnpike. It was evening, and a beautiful coolness issued
                    from the woods on either side. They skimmed over the long level stretches; they
                    climbed hills, they raced down into valleys. Warham and the ragged, rawboned old
                    proprietor kept up a kind of conversation&mdash;about crops and politics,
                    about the ownership, value, and fertility of the farms they were passing. Susan
                    sat quiet, motionless most of the time. </p>
                <p>The last daylight faded; the stars came out; the road wound in and out, up and
                    down, amid cool dark silence and mysterious fascinating shadows. The moon
                    appeared above the tree tops straight ahead&mdash;a big moon, with a lower
                    arc of the rim clipped off. The turnpike ended; they were making equally rapid
                    progress over the dirt road which was in perfect condition as there had been no
                    rain for several days. The beat of the flying hoofs was soft now; the two men's
                    voices, fell into a lower key; the moon marked out the line of the road clearly,
                    made strange spectral minglings of light and darkness in the woods, glorified
                    the open fields and gave the occasional groups of farm buildings an ancient
                    beauty and dignity. The girl slept. </p>
                <p>At nine o'clock the twenty-mile drive ended in a long, slow climb up a road so
                    washed out, so full of holes and bowlders, that it was no road at all but simply
                    a weather-beaten hillside. A mile of this, with the liveryman's
                    curses&mdash;"dod rot it" and "gosh dang it" and similar modifications of
                    profanity for Christian use and for the presence of "the sex"&mdash;ringing
                    out at every step. Susan soon awakened, rather because the surrey was pitching
                    so wildly than because of Goslin's denunciations. A brief level stretch and they
                    stopped for <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0151" n="128"/> Warham to open the outer
                    gate into his brother Zeke's big farm. A quarter of a mile through wheat to the
                    tops of the wheels and they reached the second gate. A descent into a valley, a
                    crossing of a creek, an ascent of a steep hill, and they were at the third
                    gate&mdash;between pasture and barnyard. Now they came into view of the
                    house, set upon a slope where a spring bubbled out. The house was white and a
                    white picket fence cut off its lawn from the barnyard. A dog with a deep voice
                    began to bark. They drove up to the front gate and stopped. The dog barked in a
                    frenzy of rage, and they heard his straining and jerking at his chain. A clump
                    of cedars brooded to the right of the house; their trunks were whitewashed up to
                    the lowest branches. The house had a high stoop with wooden steps. </p>
                <p>As Warham descended and hallooed, there came a fierce tugging at the front door
                    from the inside. But the front door was not in the habit of being opened, and
                    stoutly resisted. The assault grew more strenuous; the door gave way and a tall
                    thin farmer appeared. </p>
                <p>"Hello, Zeke," called George. He opened the surrey door. "Get down," he said to
                    the girl, at the same time taking her bundle. He set it on the horse block
                    beside the gate, took out his pocketbook and paid over the four dollars.
                    "Good-by, Vic," said he pleasantly. "That's a good team you've got." </p>
                <p>"Not so coarse," said Vic. "Good-by, Mr. Warham." And off he drove. </p>
                <p>Zeke Warham had now descended the steps and was opening the front gate, which was
                    evidently as unaccustomed to use as the front door. "Howdy, George," said he.
                    "Ain't that Susie you've got with you?" Like <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0152"
                        n="129"/> George, Zeke had had an elementary education. But he had married
                    an ignorant woman, and had lived so long among his farm hands and tenants that
                    he used their mode of speech. </p>
                <p>"Yes, it's Susie," said George, shaking hands with his brother. </p>
                <p>"Howdy, Susie," said Zeke, shaking hands with her. "I see you've got your things
                    with you. Come to stay awhile?" </p>
                <p>George interrupted. "Susan, go up on the porch and take your bundle." </p>
                <p>The girl took up the shawl strap and went to the front door. She leaned upon the
                    railing of the stoop and watched the two men standing at the gate. George was
                    talking to his brother in a low tone. Occasionally the brother uttered an
                    ejaculation. She could not hear; their heads were so turned that she could not
                    see their faces. The moon made it almost as bright as day. From the pasture
                    woods came a low, sweet chorus of night life&mdash;frogs and insects and
                    occasionally a night bird. From the orchard to the left and the clover fields
                    beyond came a wonderful scented breeze. She heard a step in the hall; her Aunt
                    Sallie appeared&mdash;a comfortable, voluble woman, a hard worker and a
                    harder eater and showing it in thin hair and wrinkled face. </p>
                <p>"Why, Susie Lenox, ain't that you?" she exclaimed. </p>
                <p>"Yes, Aunt," said Susan. </p>
                <p>Her aunt kissed her, diffusing that earthy odor which is the basis of the smell
                    of country persons. At various hours of the day this odor would be modified with
                    the smell of cow stables, of chickens, of cooking, according to immediate
                    occupation. But whatever other smell there was, the earthy smell persisted. And
                    it was the smell of the house, too. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0153" n="130"/>
                <p>"Who's at the gate with your Uncle Zeke?" inquired Sallie. "Ain't it George?" </p>
                <p>"Yes," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"Why don't he come in?" She raised her voice. "George, ain't you coming in?" </p>
                <p>"Howdy, Sallie," called George. "You take the girl in. Zeke and I'll be along." </p>
                <p>"Some business, I reckon," said her aunt to Susan. "Come on. Have you had
                    supper?" </p>
                <p>"No," said Susan. She was hungry now. The splendid health of the girl that had
                    calmed her torment of soul into a dull ache was clamoring for
                    food&mdash;food to enable her body to carry her strong and enduring through
                    whatever might befall. </p>
                <p>"I'll set something out for you," said Sallie. "Come right in. You might leave
                    your bundle here by the parlor door. We'll put you in the upstairs room." </p>
                <p>They passed the front stairway, went back through the hall, through the big
                    low-ceilinged living-room with its vast fireplace now covered for the warm
                    season by a screen of flowered wallpaper. They were in the plain old dining-room
                    with its smaller fireplace and its big old-fashioned cupboards built into the
                    wall on either side of the projecting chimney-piece. "There ain't much," resumed
                    Sallie. "But I reckon you kin make out." </p>
                <p>On the gayly patterned table cover she set an array of substantial plates and
                    glasses. From various cupboards in dining-room and adjoining kitchen she
                    assembled a glass pitcher of sweet milk, a glass pitcher of buttermilk, a plate
                    of cold cornbread, a platter of cold fried chicken, a dish of golden butter, a
                    pan of cold fried potatoes, a jar of preserved crab apples and another of peach
                    butter. Susan watched with <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0154" n="131"/> hungry
                    eyes. She was thinking of nothing but food now. Her aunt looked at her and
                    smiled. </p>
                <p>"My, but you're shootin' up!" she exclaimed, admiring the girl's tall, straight
                    figure. "And you don't seem to get stringy and bony like so many, but keep nice
                    and round. Do set down." </p>
                <p>"I&mdash;I think I'll wait until Uncle George comes." </p>
                <p>"Nothing of the kind!" She pushed a wooden chair before one of the two plates she
                    had laid. "I see you've still got that lovely skin. And how tasty you dress!
                    Now, do set!" </p>
                <p>Susan seated herself. </p>
                <p>"Pitch right in, child," urged Sallie. "How's yer aunt and her Ruth?" </p>
                <p>"They're&mdash;they're well, thank you." </p>
                <p>"Do eat!" </p>
                <p>"No," said Susan. "I'll wait for Uncle." </p>
                <p>"Never mind your manners. I know you're starved." Then seeing that the girl would
                    not eat, she said, "Well, I'll go fetch him." </p>
                <p>But Susan stopped her. "Please please don't," she entreated. </p>
                <p>Sallie stared to oppose; then, arrested by the intense, appealing expression in
                    those violet-gray eyes, so beautifully shaded by dark lashes and brows, she kept
                    silent, bustled aimlessly about, boiling with suddenly aroused curiosity. It was
                    nearly half an hour by the big square wooden clock on the chimney-piece when
                    Susan heard the steps of her two uncles. Her hunger fled; the deathly sickness
                    surged up again. She trembled, grew ghastly in the yellow lamplight. Her hands
                    clutched each other in her lap. </p>
                <p>"Why, Susie!" cried her aunt. "Whatever is the matter of you!" </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0155" n="132"/>
                <p>The girl lifted her eyes to her aunt's face the eyes of a wounded, suffering,
                    horribly suffering animal. She rose, rushed out of the door into the yard, flung
                    herself down on the grass. But still she could not get the relief of tears.
                    After a while she sat up and listened. She heard faintly the voices of her uncle
                    and his relatives. Presently her aunt came out to her. She hid her face in her
                    arm and waited for the new harshness to strike. </p>
                <p>"Get up and come in, Susie." The voice was kind, was pitying&mdash;not with
                    the pity that galls, but with the pity of one who understands and feels and is
                    also human, the pity that soothes. At least to this woman she was not outcast. </p>
                <p>The girl flung herself down again and sobbed&mdash;poured out upon the bosom
                    of our mother earth all the torrents of tears that had been damming up within
                    her. And Sallie knelt beside her and patted her now and then, with a "That's
                    right. Cry it out, sweetie." </p>
                <p>When tears and sobs subsided Sallie lifted her up, walked to the house with her
                    arm round her. "Do you feel better?" </p>
                <p>"Some," admitted Susan. </p>
                <p>"The men folks have went. So we kin be comfortable. After you've et, you'll feel
                    still better." </p>
                <p>Gorge Warham had made a notable inroad upon the food and drink. But there was an
                    abundance left. Susan began with a hesitating sipping at a glass of milk and
                    nibbling at one of the generous cubes of old-fashioned cornbread. Soon she was
                    busy. It delighted Sallie to see her eat. She pressed the preserves, the
                    chicken, the cornbread upon her. "I haven't eaten since early this morning,"
                    apologized the girl. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0156" n="133"/>
                <p>"That means a big hole to fill," observed Sallie. "Try this buttermilk." </p>
                <p>But Susan could hold no more. </p>
                <p>"I reckon you're pretty well tired out," observed Sallie. </p>
                <p>"I'll help you straighten up," said Susan, rising. </p>
                <p>"No. Let me take you up to bed&mdash;while the men's still outside." </p>
                <p>Susan did not insist. They returned through the empty sitting-room and along the
                    hall. Aunt Sallie took the bundle, and they ascended to the spare bedroom.
                    Sallie showed her into the front room&mdash;a damp, earthy odor; a wallpaper
                    with countless reproductions of two little brown girls in a brown swing under a
                    brown tree; a lofty bed, white and tomb-like; some preposterous artificial
                    flowers under glass on chimney-piece and table; three bright chromos on the
                    walls; "God Bless Our Home" in pink, blue and yellow worsted over the door. </p>
                <p>"I'll run down and put the things away," said her aunt. "Then I'll come back." </p>
                <p>Susan put her bundle on the sofa, opened it, found nightgown and toilet articles
                    on top. She looked uncertainly about, rapidly undressed, got into the nightgown.
                    "I'll turn down the bed and lie on it until Auntie comes," she said to herself.
                    The bed was delightfully cool; the shuck mattress made soft crackling sounds
                    under her and gave out a soothing odor of the fields. Hardly had her head
                    touched the pillow when she fell sound asleep. In a few minutes her aunt came
                    hurrying in, stopped short at sight of that lovely childlike face with the
                    lamplight full upon it. One of Susan's tapering arms was flung round her dark
                    wavy hair. Sallie Warham smiled gently. "Bless the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0157"/> baby" she said half aloud. Then her smile
                    faded and a look of sadness and pity came. "Poor child!" she murmured. "The
                    Warham men's hard. But then all the men's hard. Poor child." And gently she
                    kissed the girl's flushed cheek. "And she never had no mother, nor nothing." She
                    sighed, gradually lowered the flame of the little old glass lamp, blew it out,
                    and went noiselessly from the room, closing the door behind her. </p>

                <head> IX</head>
                <p> SUSAN sat up in bed suddenly, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. It was broad day,
                    and the birds were making a mighty clamor. She gazed round, astonished that it
                    was not her own room. Then she remembered. But it was as a child remembers; for
                    when we have the sense of perfect physical well-being we cannot but see our
                    misfortunes with the child's sense of unreality&mdash;and Susan had not only
                    health but youth, was still in the child stage of the period between childhood
                    and womanhood. She lay down again, with the feeling that so long as she could
                    stay in that comfortable bed, with the world shut out, just so long would all be
                    well with her. Soon, however, the restlessness of all nature under the stimulus
                    and heat of that brilliant day communicated itself to her vigorous young body.
                    For repose and inaction are as foreign to healthy life as death itself, of which
                    they are the symptoms; and if ever there was an intense and vivid life, Susan
                    had it. She got up and dressed, and leaned from the window, watching the
                    two-horse reaper in the wheat fields across the hollow of the pasture, and
                    listening to its faint musical whirr. The cows which had just been milked were
                    moving sedately through the gate into the pasture, where the bull, under a tree,
                    was placidly awaiting them. A boy, in huge straw hat and a blue cotton shirt and
                    linsey woolsey trousers rolled high upon his brown bare legs, was escorting the
                    herd. </p>
                <p>Her aunt in fresh, blue, checked calico came in. <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0159"
                        n="136"/> "Wouldn't you like some breakfast?" said she. And Susan read in
                    her manner that the men were out of the way. </p>
                <p>"No, I don't feel hungry," Susan replied. </p>
                <p>She thought this was true; but when she was at the table she ate almost as
                    heartily as she had the night before. As Susan ate she gazed out into the back
                    yard of the house, where chickens of all sizes, colors and ages were peering and
                    picking about. Through the fence of the kitchen garden she saw Lew, the farm
                    hand, digging potatoes. There were ripening beans on tall poles, and in the
                    farther part the forming heads of cabbages, the sprouting melon vines, the
                    beautiful fresh green of the just springing garden corn. The window through
                    which she was looking was framed in morning glories and hollyhocks, and over by
                    the garden gate were on the one side a clump of elders, on the other the hardy
                    graceful stalks of gaudily spreading sunflowers. Bees flew in and out, and one
                    lighted upon the dish of honey in the comb that went so well with the hot
                    biscuit. </p>
                <p>She rose and wandered out among the chickens, to pick up little fluffy youngsters
                    one after another, and caress them, to look in the henhouse itself, where
                    several hens were sitting with the pensive expression that accompanies the
                    laying of eggs. She thought of those other hens, less conventional, who ran away
                    to lay in secret places in the weeds, to accumulate a store against the time
                    when the setting instinct should possess them. </p>
                <p>She thought of those cannier, less docile hens and laughed. She opened a gate
                    into the barnyard, intending to go to the barn for a look at the horses, taking
                    in the duck pond and perhaps the pigs on the way. Her Uncle Gorge's voice
                    arrested her. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0160" n="137"/>
                <p>"Susan," he cried. "Come here." </p>
                <p>She turned and looked wistfully at him. The same harsh, unforgiving
                    countenance&mdash;mean with anger and petty thoughts. As she moved
                    hesitatingly toward him he said, "You are not to go out of the yard." And he
                    reentered the house. What a mysterious cruel world! Could it be the same world
                    she had lived in so happily all the years until a few days ago&mdash;the
                    same she had always found "God's beautiful world," full of gentleness and
                    kindness? </p>
                <p>And why had it changed? What was this sin that after a long sleep in her mother's
                    grave had risen to poison everyone against her? And why had it risen? It was all
                    beyond her. </p>
                <p>She strolled wretchedly within bounds, with a foreboding of impending evil. She
                    watched Lew in the garden; she got her aunt to let her help with the
                    churning&mdash;drive the dasher monotonously up and down until the butter
                    came; then she helped work the butter, helped gather the vegetables for dinner,
                    did everything and anything to keep herself from thinking. Toward eleven o'clock
                    her Uncle Zeke appeared in the dining-room, called his wife from the kitchen.
                    Susan felt that at last something was to happen. After a long time her aunt
                    returned; there were all the evidences of weeping in her face. </p>
                <p>"You'd better go to your room and straighten it up," she said without looking at
                    the girl. "The thing has aired long enough, I reckon. . . . And you'd better
                    stay up there till I call you." </p>
                <p>Susan had finished the room, was about to unpack the heavy-laden shawl strap and
                    shake the wrinkles out of the skirts, folded away for two days now. She heard
                    the sound of a horse's hoofs, went to the window. A <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0161" n="138"/> young man whom she recognized as one
                    of her Uncle Zeke's tenants was hitching to the horse block a well-set-up young
                    mare drawing a species of broad-seated breaking sulky. He had a handsome common
                    face, a wavy black mustache. She remembered that his name was
                    Ferguson&mdash;Jeb Ferguson, and that he was working on shares what was
                    known as "the creek-bottom farm," which began about a mile and a half away,
                    straight down the pasture hollow. He glanced up at the window, raised his black
                    slouch hat, and nodded with the self-conscious, self-assured grin of the desired
                    of women. She tried to return this salute with a pleasant smile. He entered the
                    gate and she heard his boots upon the front steps. </p>
                <p>Now away across the hollow another figure appeared&mdash;a man on horseback
                    coming through the wheat fields. He was riding toward the farther gate of the
                    pasture at a leisurely dignified pace. She had only made out that he had
                    abundant whiskers when the sound of a step upon the stairs caused her to turn.
                    As that step came nearer her heart beat more and more wildly. Her wide eyes
                    fixed upon the open door of the room. It was her Uncle George. </p>
                <p>"Sit down," he said as he reached the threshhold{sic}. "I want to talk to you." </p>
                <p>She seated herself, with hands folded in her lap. Her head was aching from the
                    beat of the blood in her temples. </p>
                <p>"Zeke and I have talked it over," said Warham. "And we've decided that the only
                    thing to do with you is to get you settled. So in a few minutes now you're going
                    to be married." </p>
                <p>Her lack of expression showed that she did not understand. In fact, she could
                    only feel&mdash;feel the cruel, <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0162" n="139"/>
                    contemptuous anger of that voice which all her days before had caressed her. </p>
                <p>"We've picked out a good husband for you," Warham continued. "It's Jeb Ferguson." </p>
                <p>Susan quivered. "I&mdash;I don't want to," she said. </p>
                <p>"It ain't a question of what you want," retorted Warham roughly. He was
                    twenty-four hours and a night's sleep away from his first fierce outblazing of
                    fury&mdash;away from the influence of his wife and his daughter. If it had
                    not been for his brother Zeke, narrow and cold, the event might have been
                    different. But Zeke was there to keep his "sense of duty" strong. And that he
                    might nerve himself and hide and put down any tendency to be a "soft-hearted
                    fool"&mdash;a tendency that threatened to grow as he looked at the
                    girl&mdash;the child&mdash;he assumed the roughest manner he could
                    muster. </p>
                <p>"It ain't a question of what you want," he repeated. "It's a question of what's
                    got to be done, to save my family and you, too&mdash;from disgrace. We ain't
                    going to have any more bastards in this family." </p>
                <p>The word meant nothing to the girl. But the sound of it, as her uncle pronounced
                    it, made her feel as though the blood were drying up in her veins. </p>
                <p>"We ain't going to take any chances," pursued Warham, less roughly; for now that
                    he had looked the situation full and frankly in the face, he had no nerve to
                    brace himself. The necessity of what he was prepared to do and to make her do
                    was too obvious. "Ferguson's here, and Zeke saw the preacher we sent for riding
                    in from the main road. So I've come to tell you. If you'd like to fix up a
                    little, why your Aunt Sallie'll be here in a minute. You want to pray God to
                    make you a good wife. And you ought to be thankful <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0163" n="140"/> you have sensible relations to step
                    in and save you from yourself." </p>
                <p>Susan tried to speak; her voice died in her throat. She made another effort. "I
                    don't want to," she said. </p>
                <p>"Then what do you want to do&mdash;tell me that!" exclaimed her uncle, rough
                    again. For her manner was very moving, the more so because there was none of the
                    usual appeal to pity and to mercy. </p>
                <p>She was silent. </p>
                <p>"There isn't anything else for you to do." </p>
                <p>"I want to&mdash;to stay here." </p>
                <p>"Do you think Zeke'd harbor you&mdash;when you're about certain to up and
                    disgrace us as your mother did?" </p>
                <p>"I haven't done anything wrong," said the girl dully. </p>
                <p>"Don't you dare lie about that!" </p>
                <p>"I've seen Ruth do the same with Artie Sinclair&mdash;and all the girls with
                    different boys." </p>
                <p>"You miserable girl!" cried her uncle. </p>
                <p>"I never heard it was so dreadful to let a boy kiss you." </p>
                <p>"Don't pretend to be innocent. You know the difference between that and what you
                    did!" </p>
                <p>Susan realized that when she had kissed Sam she had really loved him. Perhaps
                    that was the fatal difference. And her mother&mdash;the sin there had been
                    that she really loved while the man hadn't. Yes, it must be so. Ruth's
                    explanation of these mysteries had been different; but then Ruth had also
                    admitted that she knew little about the matter&mdash;and Susan most doubted
                    the part that Ruth had assured her was certainly true. </p>
                <p>"I didn't know," said Susan to her uncle. "Nobody ever told me. I thought we were
                    engaged." </p>
                <p>"A good woman don't need to be told," retorted <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0164"
                        n="141"/> Warham. "But I'm not going to argue with you. You've got to
                    marry." </p>
                <p>"I couldn't do that," said the girl. "No, I couldn't." </p>
                <p>"You'll either take him or you go back to Sutherland and I'll have you locked up
                    in the jail till you can be sent to the House of Correction. You can take your
                    choice." </p>
                <p>Susan sat looking at her slim brown hands and interlacing her long fingers. The
                    jail! The House of Correction was dreadful enough, for though she had never seen
                    it she had heard what it was for, what kind of boys and girls lived there. But
                    the jail&mdash;she had seen the jail, back behind the courthouse, with its
                    air of mystery and of horror. Not Hell itself seemed such a frightful thing as
                    that jail. </p>
                <p>"Well&mdash;which do you choose?" said her uncle in a sharp voice. </p>
                <p>The girl shivered. "I don't care what happens to me," she said, and her voice was
                    dull and sullen and hard. </p>
                <p>"And it doesn't much matter," sneered Warham. Every time he looked at her his
                    anger flamed again at the outrage to his love, his trust, his honor, and the
                    impending danger of more illegitimacy. "Marrying Jeb will give you a chance to
                    reform and be a good woman. He understands&mdash;so you needn't be afraid of
                    what he'll find out." </p>
                <p>"I don't care what happens to me," the girl repeated in the same monotonous
                    voice. </p>
                <p>Warham rose. "I'll send your Aunt Sallie," said he. "And when I call, she'll
                    bring you down." </p>
                <p>The girl's silence, her non-resistance the awful expression of her still
                    features&mdash;made him uneasy. He went to the window instead of to the
                    door. He glanced <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0165" n="142"/> furtively at her;
                    but he might have glanced openly as there wasn't the least danger of meeting her
                    eyes. "You're marrying about as well as you could have hoped to,
                    anyhow&mdash;better, probably," he observed, in an argumentative, defensive
                    tone. "Zeke says Jeb's about the likeliest young fellow he knows&mdash;a
                    likelier fellow than either Zeke or I was at his age. I've given him two
                    thousand dollars in cash. That ought to start you off well." And he went out
                    without venturing another look at her. Her youth and helplessness, her stony
                    misery, were again making it harder for him to hold himself to what he and the
                    fanatic Zeke had decided to be his duty as a Christian, as a father, as a
                    guardian. Besides, he did not dare face his wife and his daughter until the
                    whole business was settled respectably and finally. His sister-in-law was
                    waiting in the next room. As soon as his descent cleared the way she hurried in.
                    From the threshold she glanced at the girl; what she saw sent her hurrying out
                    to recompose herself. But the instant she again saw that expression of mute and
                    dazed despair the tears fought for release. The effort to suppress outward signs
                    of pity made her plain fat face grotesque. She could not speak. With a corner of
                    her apron she wiped imaginary dust from the glass bells that protected the
                    artificial flowers. The poor child! And all for no fault of hers&mdash;and
                    because she had been born out of wedlock. But then, the old woman reflected, was
                    it not one of the most familiar of God's mysterious ways that people were
                    punished most severely of all for the things that weren't their
                    fault&mdash;for being born in shame, or in bad or low families, or sickly,
                    or for being stupid or ugly or ignorant? She envied Zeke&mdash;his
                    unwavering belief in religion. She <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0166" n="143"/>
                    believed, but her tender heart was always leading her into doubts. </p>
                <p>She at last got some sort of control over her voice. "It'll turn out for the
                    best," she said, with her back to Susan. "It don't make much difference nohow
                    who a woman marries, so long as he's steady and a good provider. Jeb seems to be
                    a nice feller. He's better looking than your Uncle George was before he went to
                    town and married a Lenox and got sleeked up. And Jeb ain't near so close as
                    some. That's a lot in a husband." And in a kind of hysteria, bred of fear of
                    silence just then, she rattled on, telling how this man lay awake o' nights
                    thinking how to skin a flea for its hide and tallow, how that one had said only
                    a fool would pay over a quarter for a new hat for his wife&mdash; </p>
                <p>"Will it be long?" asked the girl. </p>
                <p>"I'll go down and see," said Mrs. Warham, glad of a real excuse for leaving the
                    room. She began to cry as soon as she was in the hall. Two sparrows lit upon the
                    window sill near Susan and screamed and pecked at each other in a mock fight.
                    She watched them; but her shiver at the faint sound of her aunt's returning step
                    far away down the stairs showed where her attention was. When Zeke's wife
                    entered she was standing and said: </p>
                <p>"Is it time?" </p>
                <p>"Come on, honey. Now don't be afraid." </p>
                <p>Susan advanced with a firm step, preceded her aunt down the stairs. The black
                    slouch hat and the straw of dignified cut were side by side on the shiny hall
                    table. The parlor door was open; the rarely used showroom gave forth an earthy,
                    moldy odor like that of a disturbed grave. Its shutters, for the first time in
                    perhaps <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0167" n="144"/> a year, were open; the mud
                    daubers that had built in the crevices between shutters and sills, fancying they
                    would never be disturbed, were buzzing crossly about their ruined homes. The
                    four men were seated, each with his legs crossed, and each wearing the funereal
                    expression befitting a solemn occasion. Susan did not lift her eyes. The
                    profusely whiskered man seated on the haircloth sofa smoothed his black alpaca
                    coat, reset the black tie deep hid by his beard, rose and advanced with a
                    clerical smile whose real kindliness took somewhat from its offensive unction.
                    "This is the young lady, is it?" said he, reaching for Susan's rising but
                    listless hand. "She is indeed a _young_ lady!" </p>
                <p>The two Warham men stood, shifting uneasily from leg to leg and rubbing their
                    faces from time to time. Sallie Warham was standing also, her big unhealthy face
                    twitching fantastically. Jeb alone was seated&mdash;chair tilted back, hands
                    in trousers pockets, a bucolic grin of embarrassment giving an expression of
                    pain to his common features. A strained silence, then Zeke Warham said: </p>
                <p>"I reckon we might as well go ahead." </p>
                <p>The preacher took a small black-bound book from the inside pocket of his limp and
                    dusty coat, cleared his throat, turned over the pages. That rustling, the
                    creaking of his collar on his overstarched shirt band, and the buzzing of the
                    mud daubers round the windows were the only sounds. The preacher found the
                    place, cleared his throat again. </p>
                <p>"Mr. Ferguson&mdash;" </p>
                <p>Jeb, tall, spare, sallow, rose awkwardly. </p>
                <p>"&mdash;You and Miss Lenox will take your places here&mdash;" and he
                    indicated a position before him. </p>
                <p>Susan was already in place; Jeb shuffled up to stand <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0168" n="145"/> at her left. Sallie Warham hid her
                    face in her apron. The preacher cleared his throat vigorously,
                    began&mdash;"Dearly beloved"&mdash;and so on and on. When he put the
                    questions to Susan and Jeb he told them what answer was expected, and they
                    obeyed him, Jeb muttering, Susan with a mere, movement of the lips. When he had
                    finished&mdash;a matter of less than three minutes&mdash;he shook hands
                    warmly first with Susan, then with Jeb. "Live in the fear of the Lord," he said.
                    "That's all that's necessary." </p>
                <p>Sallie put down her apron. Her face was haggard and gray. She kissed Susan
                    tenderly, then led her from the room. They went upstairs to the bedroom. "Do you
                    want to stay to dinner?" she asked in the hoarse undertone of funeral occasions.
                    "Or would you rather go right away?" </p>
                <p>"I'd rather go," said the girl. </p>
                <p>"You set down and make yourself comfortable. I'll hook up your shawl strap." </p>
                <p>Susan sat by the window, her hands in her lap. The hand with the new circlet of
                    gold on it was uppermost. Sallie busied herself with the bundle; abruptly she
                    threw her apron over her face, knelt by the bed and sobbed and uttered
                    inarticulate moans. The girl made no sound, did not move, looked unseeingly at
                    her inert hands. A few moments and Sallie set to work again. She soon had the
                    bundle ready, brought Susan's hat, put it on. </p>
                <p>"It's so hot, I reckon you'll carry your jacket. I ain't seen as pretty a blue
                    dress as this&mdash;yet it's plainlike, too." She went to the top of the
                    stairs. "She wants to go, Jeb," she called loudly. "You'd better get the sulky
                    ready." </p>
                <p>The answer from below was the heavy thump of <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0169"
                        n="146"/> Jeb's boots on the oilcloth covering of the hall floor. Susan,
                    from the window, dully watched the young farmer unhitch the mare and lead her up
                    in front of the gate. </p>
                <p>"Come on, honey," said Aunt Sallie, taking up the bundle. </p>
                <p>The girl&mdash;she seemed a child now&mdash;followed her. On the front
                    stoop were George and his brother and the preacher. The men made room for them
                    to pass. Sallie opened the gate; Susan went out. "You'll have to hold the
                    bundle," said Sallie. Susan mounted to the seat, took the bundle on her knees.
                    Jeb, who had the lines, left the mare's head and got up beside his bride. </p>
                <p>"Good day, all," he said, nodding at the men on the stoop. "Good day, Mrs.
                    Warham." </p>
                <p>"Come and see us real soon," said Sallie. Her fat chin was quivering; her
                    tired-looking, washed-out eyes gazed mournfully at the girl who was acting and
                    looking as if she were walking in her sleep. </p>
                <p>"Good day, all," repeated Jeb, and again he made the clucking sound. </p>
                <p>"Good-by and God bless you," said the preacher. His nostrils were luxuriously
                    sniffing the air which bore to them odors of cookery. </p>
                <p>The mare set out. Susan's gaze rested immovably upon the heavy bundle in her lap.
                    As the road was in wretched repair, Jeb's whole attention was upon his driving.
                    At the gate between barnyard and pasture he said, "You hold the lines while I
                    get down." </p>
                <p>Susan's fingers closed mechanically upon the strips of leather. Jeb led the mare
                    through the gate, closed it, resumed his seat. This time the mare went on
                    without exacting the clucking sound. They were following <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0170" n="147"/> the rocky road along the wester
                    hillside of the pasture hollow. As they slowly made their way among the deep
                    ruts and bowlders, from frequent moistenings of the lips and throats, noises,
                    and twitchings of body and hands, it was evident that the young farmer was
                    getting ready for conversation. The struggle at last broke surface with, "Zeke
                    Warham don't waste no time road patchin'&mdash;does he?" </p>
                <p>Susan did not answer. </p>
                <p>Jeb studied her out of the corner of his eye, the first time a fairly good bit of
                    roadway permitted. He could make nothing of her face except that it was about
                    the prettiest he had ever seen. Plainly she was not eager to get acquainted;
                    still, acquainted they must get. So he tried again: </p>
                <p>"My sister Keziah&mdash;she keeps house for me&mdash;she'll be mighty
                    surprised when I turn up with a wife. I didn't let on to her what I was about,
                    nary a word." </p>
                <p>He laughed and looked expectantly at the girl. Her expression was unchanged. Jeb
                    again devoted himself to his driving. </p>
                <p>"No, I didn't let on," he presently resumed. "Fact is, I wan't sure myself till I
                    seed you at the winder." He smiled flirtatiously at her. "Then I decided to go
                    ahead. I dunno, but I somehow kinder allow you and me'll hit it off purty
                    well&mdash;don't you?" </p>
                <p>Susan tried to speak. She found that she could not&mdash;that she had nothing
                    to say. </p>
                <p>"You're the kind of a girl I always had my mind set on," pursued Jeb, who was an
                    expert love-maker. "I like a smooth skin and pouty lips that looks as if they
                    wanted to be kissed." He took the reins in one hand, put his arm round her,
                    clumsily found her lips with his. She shrank slightly, then submitted. But Jeb
                    somehow <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0171" n="148"/> felt no inclination to kiss
                    her again. After a moment he let his arm drop away from her waist and took the
                    reins in both hands with an elaborate pretense that the bad road compelled it. </p>
                <p>A long silence, then he tried again: "It's cool and nice under these here trees,
                    ain't it?" </p>
                <p>"Yes," she said. </p>
                <p>"I ain't saw you out here for several years now. How long has it been?" </p>
                <p>"Three summers ago." </p>
                <p>"You must 'a' growed some. I don't seem to recollect you. You like the country?" </p>
                <p>"Yes." </p>
                <p>"Sho! You're just sayin' that. You want to live in town. Well, so do I. And as
                    soon as I get things settled a little I'm goin' to take what I've got and the
                    two thousand from your Uncle George and open up a livery stable in town." </p>
                <p>Susan's strange eyes turned upon him. "In Sutherland?" she asked breathlessly. </p>
                <p>"Right in Sutherland," replied he complacently. "I think I'll buy Jake Antle's
                    place in Jefferson Street." </p>
                <p>Susan was blanched and trembling. "Oh, no," she cried. "You mustn't do that!" </p>
                <p>Jeb laughed. "You see if I don't. And we'll live in style, and you can keep a gal
                    and stay dolled up all the time. Oh, I know how to treat you." </p>
                <p>"I want to stay in the country," cried Susan. "I hate Sutherland." </p>
                <p>"Now, don't you be afraid," soothed Jeb. "When people see you've got a husband
                    and money they'll not be down on you no more. They'll forget all about your
                    maw&mdash;and they won't know nothin' about the other thing. You treat me
                    right and I'll treat you <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0172" n="149"/> right. I'm
                    not one to rake up the past. There ain't arry bit of meanness about me!" </p>
                <p>"But you'll let me stay here in the country?" pleaded Susan. Her imagination was
                    torturing her with pictures of herself in Sutherland and the people craning and
                    whispering and mocking. </p>
                <p>"You go where I go," replied Jeb. "A woman's place is with her man. And I'll
                    knock anybody down that looks cockeyed at you." </p>
                <p>"Oh!" murmured Susan, sinking back against the support. </p>
                <p>"Don't you fret, Susie," ordered Jeb, confident and patronizing. "You do what I
                    say and everything'll be all right. That's the way to get along with me and get
                    nice clothes&mdash;do what I say. With them that crosses me I'm mighty ugly.
                    But you ain't a-goin' to cross me. . . . Now, about the house. I reckon I'd
                    better send Keziah off right away. You kin cook?" </p>
                <p>"A&mdash;a little," said Susan. </p>
                <p>Jeb looked relieved. "Then she'd be in the way. Two women about always
                    fights&mdash;and Keziah's got the Ferguson temper. She's afraid of me, but
                    now and then she fergits and has a tantrum." Jeb looked at her with a smile and
                    a frown. "Perk up a little," he more than half ordered. "I don't want Keziah
                    jeerin' at me." </p>
                <p>Susan made a pitiful effort to smile. He eyed it sourly, grunted, gave the mare a
                    cut with the whip that caused her to leap forward in a gallop. "Whoa!" he
                    yelled. "Whoa&mdash;damn you!" And he sawed cruelly at her mouth until she
                    quieted down. A turning and they were before a shallow story-and-a-half frame
                    house which squatted like an old roadside beggar behind a weather-beaten picket
                    fence. The sagging <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0173" n="150"/> shingle roof
                    sloped abruptly; there were four little windows downstairs and two smaller
                    upstairs. The door was in the center of the house; a weedy path led from its
                    crooked step, between two patches of weedy grass, to the gate in the fence. </p>
                <p>"Whoa!" shouted Jeb, with the double purpose of stopping the mare and informing
                    the house of his arrival. Then to Susan: "You git down and I'll drive round to
                    the barn yonder." He nodded toward a dilapidated clapboard structure, small and
                    mean, set between a dirty lopsided straw heap and a manure heap. "Go right in
                    and make yourself at home. Tell Keziah who you air. I'll be along, soon as I
                    unhitch and feed the mare." </p>
                <p>Susan was staring stupidly at the house&mdash;at her new home. </p>
                <p>"Git down," he said sharply. "You don't act as if your hearin' or your manners
                    was much to brag on." </p>
                <p>He felt awkward and embarrassed with this delicately bred, lovely child-woman in
                    the, to him, wonderfully fine and fashionable dress. To hide his nervousness and
                    to brave it out, he took the only way he knew, the only way shy people usually
                    know&mdash;the way of gruffness. It was not a ferocious gruffness for a man
                    of his kind; but it seemed so to her who had been used to gentleness only, until
                    these last few days. His grammar, his untrained voice, his rough clothes, the
                    odor of stale sweat and farm labor he exhaled, made him horrible to
                    her&mdash;though she only vaguely knew why she felt so wretched and why her
                    body shrank from him. </p>
                <p>She stepped down from the sulky, almost falling in her dizziness and blindness.
                    Jeb touched the mare with the whip and she was alone before the
                    house&mdash;a sweet forlorn figure, childish, utterly out of place in <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0174" n="151"/> those surroundings. On the threshold,
                    in faded and patched calico, stood a tall gaunt woman with a family likeness to
                    Jeb. She had thin shiny black hair, a hard brown skin, high cheekbones and
                    snapping black eyes. When her thin lips parted she showed on the left side of
                    the mouth three large and glittering gold teeth that in the contrast made their
                    gray, not too clean neighbors seem white. </p>
                <p>"Howdy!" she called in a tone of hostility. </p>
                <p>Susan tried in vain to respond. She stood gazing. </p>
                <p>"What d'ye want?" </p>
                <p>"He he told me to go in," faltered Susan. She had no sense of reality. It was a
                    dream&mdash;only a dream&mdash;and she would awaken in her own clean
                    pretty pale-gray bedroom with Ruth gayly calling her to come down to breakfast. </p>
                <p>"Who are you?" demanded Keziah&mdash;for at a glance it was the sister. </p>
                <p>"I'm&mdash;I'm Susan Lenox." </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;Zeke Warham's niece. Come right in." And Keziah looked as if she
                    were about to bite and claw. </p>
                <p>Susan pushed open the latchless gate, went up the short path to the doorstep. "I
                    think I'll wait till he comes," she said. </p>
                <p>"No. Come in and sit down, Miss Lenox." And Keziah drew a rush-bottomed rocking
                    chair toward the doorway. Susan was looking at the interior. The lower floor of
                    the house was divided into three small rooms. This central room was obviously
                    the parlor&mdash;the calico-covered sofa, the center table, the two dingy
                    chromos, and a battered cottage organ made that certain. On the floor was a rag
                    carpet; on the walls, torn and dirty paper, with huge weather stains marking <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0175" n="152"/> where water had leaked from the roof
                    down the supporting beams. Keziah scowled at Susan's frank expression of
                    repulsion for the surroundings. Susan seated herself on the edge of the chair,
                    put her bundle beside her. </p>
                <p>"I allow you'll stay to dinner," said Keziah. </p>
                <p>"Yes," replied Susan. </p>
                <p>"Then I'll go put on some more to cook." </p>
                <p>"Oh, no&mdash;please don't&mdash;I couldn't eat
                    anything&mdash;really, I couldn't." The girl spoke hysterically. </p>
                <p>Just then Jeb came round the house and appeared in the doorway. He grinned and
                    winked at Susan, looked at his sister. "Well, Keziah," said he, "what d'ye think
                    of her?" </p>
                <p>"She says she's going to stay to dinner, " observed Keziah, trying to maintain
                    the veneer of manners she had put on for company. </p>
                <p>The young man laughed loudly. "That's a good one&mdash;that is!" he cried,
                    nodding and winking at Susan. "So you ain't tole her? Well, Keziah, I've been
                    and gone and got married. And there _she_ is." </p>
                <p>"Shut up&mdash;you fool!" said Keziah. And she looked apologetically at their
                    guest. But the expression of Susan's face made her catch her breath. "For the
                    Lord's sake!" she ejaculated. "She ain't married _you!_" </p>
                <p>"Why not?" demanded Jeb. "Ain't this a free country? Ain't I as good as anybody?" </p>
                <p>Keziah blew out her breath in a great gust and seated herself on the tattered
                    calico cover of the sofa. Susan grew deathly white. Her hands trembled. Then she
                    sat quiet upon the edge of the old rush-bottomed chair. There was a terrible
                    silence, broken by Jeb's saying loudly and fiercely, "Keziah, you go get the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0176" n="153"/> dinner. Then you pack your duds and
                    clear out for Uncle Bob's." </p>
                <p>Keziah stared at the bride, rose and went to the rear door. "I'm goin' now," she
                    answered. "The dinner's ready except for putting on the table." </p>
                <p>Through the flimsy partitions they heard her mounting the uncarpeted stairs,
                    hustling about upon an uncarpeted floor above, and presently descending. "I'll
                    hoof it," she said, reappearing in the doorway. "I'll send for my things this
                    afternoon." </p>
                <p>Jeb, not caring to provoke the "Ferguson temper," said nothing. </p>
                <p>"As for this here marryin'," continued Keziah, "I never allowed you'd fall so low
                    as to take a baby, and a bastard at that." </p>
                <p>She whirled away. Jeb flung his hat on the table, flung himself on the sofa.
                    "Well&mdash;that's settled," said he. "You kin get the dinner. It's all in
                    there." And he jerked his head toward the door in the partition to the left.
                    Susan got up, moved toward the indicated door. Jeb laughed. "Don't you think you
                    might take off your hat and stay awhile?" said he. </p>
                <p>She removed her hat, put it on top of the bundle which she left on the floor
                    beside the rocking chair. She went into the kitchen dining-room. It was a
                    squalid room, its ceiling and walls smoke-stained from the cracked and never
                    polished stove in the corner. The air was foul with the strong old onions
                    stewing on the stove. In a skillet slices of pork were frying. On the back of
                    the stove stood a pan of mashed potatoes and a tin coffeepot. On the stained
                    flowered cloth which covered the table in the middle of the room had been laid
                    coarse, cracked dishes and discolored steel knives and forks with black wooden
                    handles. Susan, half <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0177" n="154"/> fainting,
                    dropped into a chair by one of the open windows. A multitude of fat flies from
                    the stable were running and crawling everywhere, were buzzing about her head.
                    She was aroused by Jeb's voice: "Why, what the&mdash;the damnation! You've
                    fell asleep!" </p>
                <p>She started up. "In a minute!" she muttered, nervously. </p>
                <p>And somehow, with Jeb's eyes on her from the doorway, she got the evil-smelling
                    messes from the stove into table dishes from the shelves and then on the table,
                    where the flies descended upon them in troops of scores and hundreds. Jeb, in
                    his shirt sleeves now, sat down and fell to. She sat opposite him, her hands in
                    her lap. He used his knife in preference to his fork, leaping the blade high,
                    packing the food firmly upon it with fork or fingers, then thrusting it into his
                    mouth. He ate voraciously, smacking his lips, breathing hard, now and then
                    eructing with frank energy and satisfaction. </p>
                <p>"My stummick's gassy right smart this year," he observed after a huge gulp of
                    coffee. "Some says the heavy rains last spring put gas into everything, but I
                    dunno. Maybe it's Keziah's cooking. I hope you'll do better. Why, you ain't
                    eatin' nothin'!" </p>
                <p>"I'm not hungry," said Susan. Then, as he frowned suspiciously, "I had a late
                    breakfast." </p>
                <p>He laughed. "And the marrying, too," he suggested with a flirtatious nod and
                    wink. "Women's always upset by them kind of things." </p>
                <p>When he had filled himself he pushed his chair back. "I'll set with you while you
                    wash up," said he. "But you'd better take off them Sunday duds. You'll find some
                    calikers that belonged to maw in a box under <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0178"
                        n="155"/> the bed in our room." He laughed and winked at her. </p>
                <p>"That's the one on t'other side of the settin'-room. Yes&mdash;that's our'n!"
                    And he winked again. </p>
                <p>The girl, ghastly white, her great eyes staring like a sleepwalker's, rose and
                    stood resting one hand on the back of the chair to steady her. </p>
                <p>Jeb drew a cigar from his waistcoat pocket and lighted it. "Usually," said he, "I
                    take a pipe or a chaw. But this bein' a weddin' day&mdash;" </p>
                <p>He laughed and winked again, rose, took her in his arms and kissed her. She made
                    a feeble gesture of thrusting him away. Her head reeled, her stomach turned. </p>
                <p>She got away as soon as he would release her, crossed the sitting-room and
                    entered the tiny dingy bedroom. The windows were down and the bed had not yet
                    been made. The odor was nauseating&mdash;the staleness left by a not too
                    clean sleeper who abhors fresh air. Susan saw the box under the bed, knelt to
                    draw it out. But instead she buried her face in her hands, burst into wild sobs.
                    "Oh, God," she prayed, "stop punishing me. I didn't mean to do
                    wrong&mdash;and I'm sure my mother didn't, either. Stop, for Thy Son's sake,
                    amen." Now surely she would wake. God must answer that prayer. She dared not
                    take her palms from her eyes. Suddenly she felt herself caught from behind. She
                    gave a wild scream and sprang up. </p>
                <p>Jeb was looking at her with eyes that filled her with a fear more awful than the
                    fear of death. "Don't!" she cried. "Don't!" </p>
                <p>"Never mind, hon," said he in a voice that was terrible just because it was soft.
                    "It's only your husband. My, but you're purty!" And he seized her. She fought.
                    He crushed her. He kissed her <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0179"/> with great
                    slobbering smacks and gnawed at the flesh of her neck with teeth that craved to
                    bite. </p>
                <p>"Oh, Mr. Ferguson, for pity's sake!" she wailed. Then she opened her mouth wide
                    as one gasping for breath where there is no air; and pushing at him with all her
                    strength she vented a series of maniac shrieks. </p>

                <head> X</head>
                <p> LATE that afternoon Jeb returned to the house after several hours of uneasy,
                    aimless pottering about at barn and woodshed. He stumped and stamped around the
                    kitchen, then in the sitting-room, finally he mustered the courage to look into
                    the bedroom, from which he had slunk like a criminal three hours before. There
                    she lay, apparently in the same position. Her waxen color and her absolute
                    stillness added fear to his sense of guilt&mdash;a guilt against which he
                    protested, because he felt he had simply done what God and man expected of him.
                    He stood in the low doorway for some time, stood there peering and craning until
                    his fear grew so great that he could no longer put off ending or confirming it. </p>
                <p>"Sleepin'?" said he in a hoarse undertone. </p>
                <p>She did not reply; she did not move. He could not see that she was breathing. </p>
                <p>"It'll soon be time to git supper," he went on&mdash;not because he was
                    thinking of supper but because he was desperately clutching for something that
                    must draw a reply from her&mdash;if she could reply. "Want me to clean up
                    the dinner and put the supper things on?" </p>
                <p>She made a feeble effort to rise, sank back again. He drew an audible sigh of
                    relief; at least she was not what her color had suggested. </p>
                <p>In fact, she was morbidly conscious. The instant she had heard him at the outer
                    door she had begun to shiver and shake, and not until he moved toward the
                    bedroom door did she become quiet. Then a calm had come <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0181" n="158"/> into her nerves and her
                    flesh&mdash;the calm that descends upon the brave when the peril actually
                    faces. As he stood there her eyes were closed, but the smell of
                    him&mdash;beneath the earthy odor of his clothing the odor of the bodies of
                    those who eat strong, coarse food&mdash;stole into her nostrils, into her
                    nerves. Her whole body sickened and shrank&mdash;for to her now that odor
                    meant marriage&mdash;and she would not have believed Hell contained or
                    Heaven permitted such a thing as was marriage. She understood now why the Bible
                    always talked of man as a vile creature born in sin. </p>
                <p>Jeb was stealthily watching her ghastly face, her limp body. "Feelin' sickish?"
                    he asked. </p>
                <p>A slight movement of the head in assent. </p>
                <p>"I kin ride over to Beecamp and fetch Doc Christie." </p>
                <p>Another and negative shake of the head, more determined. The pale lips murmured,
                    "No&mdash;no, thank you." She was not hating him. He existed for her only as
                    a symbol, in this hideous dream called life, that was coiled like a snake about
                    her and was befouling her and stinging her to death. </p>
                <p>"Don't you bother 'bout supper," said he with gruff, shamefaced generosity. "I'll
                    look out for myself, this onct." </p>
                <p>He withdrew to the kitchen, where she heard him clattering dishes and pans.
                    Daylight waned to twilight, twilight to dusk, to darkness. She did not think;
                    she did not feel, except an occasional dull pang from some bodily bruise. Her
                    soul, her mind, were absolutely numb. Suddenly a radiance beat upon her eyes.
                    All in an instant, before the lifting of her eyelids, soul and body became
                    exquisitely acute; for she thought it was he come again, with a lamp. She
                    looked; it was the moon whose beams struck full in at the uncurtained <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0182" n="159"/> window and bathed her face in their
                    mild brighteness. She closed her eyes again and presently fell
                    asleep&mdash;the utter relaxed sleep of a child that is worn out with pain,
                    when nature turns gentle nurse and sets about healing and soothing as only
                    nature can. When she awoke it was with a scream. No, she was not dreaming; there
                    was an odor in the room&mdash;his odor, with that of a saloon added to it. </p>
                <p>After cooking and eating supper he had taken the jug from its concealment behind
                    the woodbox and had proceeded to cheer his drooped spirits. The more he drank
                    the better content he was with himself, with his conduct, and the clearer became
                    his conviction that the girl was simply playing woman's familiar game of dainty
                    modesty. A proper game it was too; only a man must not pay attention to it
                    unless he wished his woman to despise him. When this conviction reached the
                    point of action he put away the jug, washed the glass, ate a liberal mouthful of
                    the left-over stewed onions, as he would not for worlds have his bride catch him
                    tippling. He put out the lamp and went to the bedroom, chuckling to himself like
                    a man about to play a particularly clever and extremely good-humored practical
                    joke. His preparations for the night were, as always, extremely simple merely a
                    flinging off of his outer clothes and, in summer, his socks. From time to time
                    he cast an admiring amorous glance at the lovely childlike face in the full
                    moonlight. As he was about to stretch himself on the bed beside her he happened
                    to note that she was dressed as when she came. That stylish, Sundayish dress was
                    already too much mussed and wrinkled. He leaned over to wake her with a kiss. It
                    was then that she started up with a scream. </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;my God!" she exclaimed, passing her hand <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0183" n="160"/> over her brow and staring at him with
                    crazed, anguished eyes. </p>
                <p>"It's jest me," said he. "Thought you'd want to git ready fur bed, like as not." </p>
                <p>"No, thank you, no," she stammered, drawing away toward the inner side of the
                    bed. "Please I want to be as I am." </p>
                <p>"Now, don't put on, sweetness," he wheedled. "You know you're married and 'ave
                    got to git used to it." </p>
                <p>He laid his hand on her arm. She had intended to obey, since that was the law of
                    God and man and since in all the world there was no other place for her,
                    nameless and outcast. But at his touch she clenched her teeth, cried: </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;Mr. Ferguson&mdash;please&mdash;_please_ let me be." </p>
                <p>"Now, hon," he pleaded, seizing her with strong gentleness. "There ain't no call
                    to be skittish. We're married, you know." </p>
                <p>She wrenched herself free. He seized her again. "What's the use of puttin' on? I
                    know all about you. You little no-name," he cursed, when her teeth sank into his
                    hand. For an instant, at that reminder of her degradation, her indelible shame
                    that made her of the low and the vile, she collapsed in weakness. Then with new
                    and fierce strength she fought again. When she had exhausted herself utterly she
                    relaxed, fell to sobbing and moaning, feebly trying to shelter her face from his
                    gluttonous and odorous kisses. And upon the scene the moon shone in all that
                    beauty which from time immemorial has filled the hearts of lovers with ecstasy
                    and of devotees with prayer. </p>
                <p> They lay quietly side by side; he fell into a profound sleep. He was full upon
                    his back, his broad <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0184" n="161"/> chest heaving in
                    the gray cotton undershirt, his mouth wide open with its upper fringe of hair in
                    disarray and agitated by his breath. Soon he began to snore, a deafening clamor
                    that set some loose object in the dark part of the room to vibrating with a
                    tapping sound. Susan stealthily raised herself upon her elbow, looked at him.
                    There was neither horror nor fear in her haggard face but only eagerness to be
                    sure he would not awaken. She, inch by inch, more softly than a cat, climbed
                    over the low footboard, was standing on the floor. One silent step at a time,
                    with eyes never from his face so clear in the moonlight, she made her way toward
                    the door. The snoring stopped&mdash;and her heart stopped with it. He
                    gasped, gurgled, gave a snort, and sat up. </p>
                <p>"What&mdash;which&mdash;" he ejaculated. Then he saw her near the door.
                    "Hello&mdash;whar ye goin'?" </p>
                <p>"I thought I'd undress," she lied, calmly and smoothly. </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;that's right." And he lay down. </p>
                <p>She stood in the darkness, making now and then a faint sound suggestive of
                    undressing. The snoring began again&mdash;soft, then deep, then the steady,
                    uproarious intake with the fierce whistling exhalation. She went into the
                    sitting-room, felt round in the darkness, swift and noiseless. On the sofa she
                    found her bundle, tore it open. By feeling alone she snatched her sailor hat, a
                    few handkerchiefs, two stockings, a collar her fingers chanced upon and a
                    toothbrush. She darted to the front door, was outside, was gliding down the
                    path, out through the gate into the road. </p>
                <p>To the left would be the way she had come. She ran to the right, with never a
                    backward glance&mdash;ran with all the speed in her lithe young body, ran
                    with <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0185" n="162"/> all the energy of her fear and
                    horror and resolve to die rather than be taken. For a few hundred yards the road
                    lay between open fields. But after that it entered a wood. And in that dimness
                    she felt the first beginnings of a sense of freedom. Half a mile and open fields
                    again, with a small house on the right, a road southeastward on the left. That
                    would be away from her Uncle Zeke's and also away from Sutherland, which lay
                    twenty miles to the southwest. When she would be followed Jeb would not think of
                    this direction until he had exhausted the other two. </p>
                <p>She walked, she ran, she rested; she walked and ran and walked again. The moon
                    ascended to the zenith, crossed the levels of the upper sky, went down in the
                    west; a long bar of dusky gray outlined a cloud low upon the horizon in the
                    northeast. She was on the verge of collapse. Her skin, the inside of her mouth,
                    were hot and dry. She had to walk along at snail's pace or her heart would begin
                    to beat as if it were about to burst and the blood would choke up into the veins
                    of her throat to suffocate her. A terrible pain came in her side&mdash;came
                    and went&mdash;came and stayed. She had passed turning after turning, to the
                    right, to the left&mdash;crossroads leading away in all directions. She had
                    kept to the main road because she did not wish to lose time, perhaps return upon
                    her path, in the confusion of the darkness. Now she began to look about her at
                    the country. It was still the hills as round Zeke Warham's&mdash;the hills
                    of southeastern Indiana. But they were steeper and higher, for she was moving
                    toward the river. There was less open ground, more and denser undergrowth and
                    forest. She felt that she was in a wilderness, was safe. Night still lay too
                    thick upon the landscape for her to distinguish anything <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0186" n="163"/> but outlines. She sat down on the
                    ruined and crumbling panel of a zigzag fence to rest and to wait for light. She
                    listened; a profound hush. She was alone, all alone. How far had she come? She
                    could not guess; but she knew that she had done well. She would have been amazed
                    if she had known how well. All the years of her life, thanks to Mrs. Warham's
                    good sense about health, she had been steadily adding to the vitality and
                    strength that were hers by inheritance. Thus, the response to this first demand
                    upon them had been almost inevitable. It augured well for the future, if the
                    future should draw her into hardships. She knew she had gone far and in what was
                    left of the night and with what was left of her strength she would put such a
                    distance between her and them that they would never believe she had got so far,
                    even should they seek in this direction. She was supporting her head upon her
                    hands, her elbows upon her knees. Her eyes closed, her head nodded; she fought
                    against the impulse, but she slept. </p>
                <p>When she straightened up with a start it was broad day. The birds must have
                    finished their morning song, for there was only happy, comfortable chirping in
                    the branches above her. She rose stiffly. Her legs, her whole body, ached; and
                    her feet were burning and blistered. But she struck out resolutely. </p>
                <p>After she had gone halfway down a long steep hill, she had to turn back because
                    she had left her only possessions. It was a weary climb, and her heart quaked
                    with terror. But no one appeared, and at last she was once more at the ruins of
                    the fence panel. There lay her sailor hat, the handkerchiefs, wrapped round the
                    toothbrush, the collar&mdash;and two stockings, one black, the other brown.
                    And where was her purse? <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0187" n="164"/> Not there,
                    certainly. She glanced round in swift alarm. No one. Yet she had been absolutely
                    sure she had taken her purse from the sitting-room table when she came upon it,
                    feeling about in the dark. She had forgotten it; she was without a cent! </p>
                <p>But she had no time to waste in self-reproaches or forebodings. Though the
                    stockings would be of no use to her, she took them along because to leave them
                    was to leave a trail. She hastened down the hill. At the bottom ran a deep
                    creek&mdash;without a bridge. The road was now a mere cowpath which only the
                    stoutest vehicles or a horseman would adventure. To her left ran an even wilder
                    trail, following the downward course of the creek. She turned out of the road,
                    entered the trail. She came to a place where the bowlders over which the creek
                    foamed and splashed as it hurried southeastward were big and numerous enough to
                    make a crossing. She took it, went slowly on down the other bank. </p>
                <p>There was no sign of human intrusion. Steeply on either side rose a hill, strewn
                    with huge bowlders, many of them large as large houses. The sun filtered through
                    the foliage to make a bright pattern upon the carpet of last year's leaves. The
                    birds twittered and chirped; the creek hummed its drowsy, soothing melody. She
                    was wretchedly weary, and Oh, so hungry! A little further, and two of the great
                    bowlders, tumbled down from the steeps, had cut off part of the creek, had
                    formed a pool which their seamed and pitted and fernadorned walls hid from all
                    observation except that of the birds and the squirrels in the boughs. </p>
                <p>At once she thought how refreshed she would be if she could bathe in those cool
                    waters. She looked round, stepped in between the bowlders. She peered <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0188" n="165"/> out; she listened. She was safe; she
                    drew back into her little inclosure. There was a small dry shelf of rock. She
                    hurried off her clothes, stood a moment in the delicious warmth of the sunshine,
                    stepped into the pool. She would have liked to splash about; but she dared make
                    no sound that could be heard above the noise of the water. Luckily the creek was
                    just there rather loud, as it was expressing its extreme annoyance over the
                    stolid impudence of the interrupting bowlders. While she was waiting for the sun
                    to dry her she looked at her underclothes. She simply could not put them on as
                    they were. She knelt at the edge of the shelf and rinsed them out as well as she
                    could. Then she spread them on the thick tufts of overhanging fern where the hot
                    sun would get full swing at them. The brown stocking of the two mismates she had
                    brought along almost matched the pair she was wearing. As there was a hole in
                    the toe of one of them, she discarded it, and so had one fresh stocking. She
                    dried her feet thoroughly with the stocking she was discarding. Then she put her
                    corsets and her dress directly upon her body. She could not afford to wait until
                    the underclothes dried; she would carry them until she found for herself a more
                    remote and better hiding place where she could await nightfall. She stuffed the
                    stocking with the hole deep into a cleft in the rock and laid a small stone upon
                    it so that it was concealed. Here where there were no traces, no reminders of
                    the human race which had cast her out and pursued her with torture of body and
                    soul, here in the wilderness her spirits were going up, and her young eyes were
                    looking hopefully round and forward. The up-piling horrors of those two days and
                    their hideous climax seemed a dream which the sun had <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0189" n="166"/> scattered. Hopefully! That blessed
                    inexperience and sheer imagination of youth enabling it to hope in a large,
                    vague way when to hope for any definite and real thing would be impossible. </p>
                <p>She cleaned her tan low shoes with branches of fern and grass, put them on. It is
                    impossible to account for the peculiarities of physical vanity. Probably no one
                    was ever born who had not physical vanity of some kind; Susan's was her feet and
                    ankles. Not her eyes, nor her hair, nor her contour, nor her skin, nor her
                    figure, though any or all of these might well have been her pleasure. Of them
                    she never thought in the way of pride or vanity. But of her feet and ankles she
                    was both proud and vain&mdash;in a reserved, wholly unobtrusive way, be it
                    said, so quietly that she had passed unsuspected. There was reason for this shy,
                    secret self-satisfaction, so amusing in one otherwise self-unconscious. Her feet
                    were beautifully formed and the curves of her instep and ankle were beautiful.
                    She gave more attention now to the look of her shoes and of her stockings than
                    to all the rest of this difficult woodland toilet. She then put on the sailor
                    hat, fastened the collar to her garter, slipped the handkerchiefs into the legs
                    of her stockings. Carrying her underclothes, ready to roll them into a ball
                    should she meet anyone, she resumed her journey into that rocky wilderness. She
                    was sore, she had pains that were the memories of the worst horrors of her
                    hideous dream, but up in her strong, healthy body, up through her strong young
                    soul, surged joy of freedom and joy of hope. Compared with what her lot had been
                    until such a few brief days before, this lot of friendless wanderer in the
                    wilderness was dark indeed. But she was comparing it with the monstrous dream
                    from which <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0190" n="167"/> it was the awakening. She
                    was almost happy&mdash;and madly hungry. </p>
                <p>An enormous bowlder, high above her and firmly fixed in the spine of the hill,
                    invited as a place where she could see without being seen, could hide securely
                    until darkness came again. She climbed to the base of it, found that she might
                    reach the top by stepping from ledge to ledge with the aid of the trees growing
                    so close around it that some of their boughs seemed rooted in its weather-dented
                    cliffs. She dragged herself upward the fifty or sixty feet, glad of the
                    difficulties because they would make any pursuer feel certain she had not gone
                    that way. After perhaps an hour she came upon a flat surface where soil had
                    formed, where grass and wild flowers and several little trees gave shade and a
                    place to sleep. And from her eyrie she commanded a vast sweep of
                    country&mdash;hills and valleys, fields, creeks, here and there lonely
                    farmhouses, and far away to the east the glint of the river! </p>
                <p>To the river! That was her destination. And somehow it would be kind, would take
                    her where she would never, never dream those frightful dreams again! </p>
                <p>She went to the side of the bowlder opposite that which she had climbed. She drew
                    back hastily, ready to cry with vexation. It was not nearly so high or so steep;
                    and on the slope of the hill a short distance away was set a little farmhouse,
                    with smoke curling up from its rough stone chimney. She dropped to all fours in
                    the tall grass and moved cautiously toward the edge. Flat upon her breast, she
                    worked her way to the edge and looked down. A faintly lined path led from the
                    house through a gate in a zigzag fence and up to the base of her fortress. The
                    rock had so crumbled on that side that a sort of path extended clear up to the
                    top. But <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0191" n="168"/> her alarm quieted somewhat
                    when she noted how the path was grass-grown. </p>
                <p>As nearly as she could judge it was about five o'clock. So that smoke meant
                    breakfast! Her eyes fixed hungrily upon the thin column of violet vapor mounting
                    straight into the still morning air. When smoke rose in that fashion, she
                    remembered, it was sure sign of clear weather. And then the thought came, "What
                    if it had been raining!" She simply could not have got away. </p>
                <p>As she interestedly watched the little house and its yard she saw hurrying
                    through the burdock and dog fennel toward the base of her rock a determined
                    looking hen. Susan laughed silently, it was so obvious that the hen was on a
                    pressing and secret business errand. But almost immediately her attention was
                    distracted to observing the movements of a human being she could obscurely make
                    out through one of the windows just back of the chimney. Soon she saw that it
                    was a woman, cleaning up a kitchen after breakfast&mdash;the early breakfast
                    of the farmhouse in summer. </p>
                <p>What had they had for breakfast? She sniffed the air. "I think I can smell ham
                    and cornbread," she said aloud, and laughed, partly at the absurdity of her
                    fancy, chiefly at the idea of such attractive food. She aggravated her hunger by
                    letting her imagination loose upon the glorious possibilities. A stealthy
                    fluttering brought her glance back to the point where the hen had disappeared.
                    The hen reappeared, hastened down the path and through the weeds, and rejoined
                    the flock in the yard with an air which seemed to say, "No, indeed, I've been
                    right here all the time." </p>
                <p>"Now, what was she up to?" wondered Susan, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0192"
                        n="169"/> the answer came to her. Eggs! A nest hidden somewhere near or in
                    the base of the rock! </p>
                <p>Could she get down to that nest without being seen from the house or from any
                    other part of the region below? She drew back from the edge, crawled through the
                    grass to the place where the path, if path it could be called, reached the top.
                    She was delighted to find that it made the ascent through a wide cleft and not
                    along the outside. She let herself down cautiously as the footway was crumbling
                    and rotten and slippery with grass. At the lower end of the cleft she peered
                    out. Trees and bushes&mdash;plenty of them, a thick shield between her and
                    the valleys. She moved slowly downward; a misstep might send her through the
                    boughs to the hillside forty feet below. She had gone up and down several times
                    before her hunger-sharpened eyes caught the gleam of white through the ferns
                    growing thickly out of the moist mossy cracks which everywhere seamed the wall.
                    She pushed the ferns aside. There was the nest, the length of her forearm into
                    the dim seclusion of a deep hole. She felt round, found the egg that was warm.
                    And as she drew it out she laughed softly and said half aloud: "Breakfast is
                    ready!" </p>
                <p>No, not quite ready. Hooking one arm round the bough of a tree that shot up from
                    the hillside to the height of the rock and beyond, she pressed her foot firmly
                    against the protecting root of an ancient vine of poison ivy. Thus ensconced,
                    she had free hands; and she proceeded to remove the thin shell of the egg piece
                    by piece. She had difficulty in restraining herself until the end. At last she
                    put the whole egg into her mouth. And never had she tasted anything so good. </p>
                <p>But one egg was only an appetizer. She reached in <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0193" n="170"/> again. She did not wish to despoil
                    the meritorious hen unnecessarily, so she held the egg up in her inclosing
                    fingers and looked through it, as she had often seen the cook do at home. She
                    was not sure, but the inside seemed muddy. She laid it to one side, tried
                    another. It was clear and she ate it as she had eaten the first. She laid aside
                    the third, the fourth, and the fifth. The sixth seemed all right&mdash;but
                    was not. Fortunately she had not been certain enough to feel justified in
                    putting the whole egg into her mouth before tasting it. The taste, however, was
                    enough to make her reflect that perhaps on the whole two eggs were sufficient
                    for breakfast, especially as there would be at least dinner and supper before
                    she could go further. As she did not wish to risk another descent, she continued
                    to sort out the eggs. She found four that were, or seemed to be, all right. The
                    thirteen that looked doubtful or worse when tested by the light she restored
                    with the greatest care. It was an interesting illustration of the rare quality
                    of consideration which at that period of her life dominated her character. </p>
                <p>She put the four eggs in the bosom of her blouse and climbed up to her eyrie. All
                    at once she felt the delicious languor of body and mind which is Nature's
                    forewarning that she is about to put us to sleep, whether we will or no. She
                    lost all anxiety about safety, looked hastily around for a bed. She found just
                    the place in a corner of the little tableland where the grass grew tall and
                    thick. She took from her bosom the four eggs&mdash;her dinner and
                    supper&mdash;and put them between the roots of a tree with a cover of broad
                    leaves over them to keep them cool. She pulled grass to make a pillow, took off
                    her collar and laid herself down to sleep. And that day's sun did not shine upon
                    a prettier sight <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0194" n="171"/> than this soundly
                    and sweetly sleeping girl, with her oval face suffused by a gentle flush, with
                    her rounded young shoulders just moving the bosom of her gray silk blouse, with
                    her slim, graceful legs curled up to the edge of her carefully smoothed blue
                    serge skirt. You would have said never a care, much less a sorrow, had shadowed
                    her dawning life. And that is what it means to be young&mdash;and free from
                    the curse of self-pity, and ignorant of life's saddest truth, that future and
                    past are not two contrasts; one is surely bright and the other is sober, but
                    they are parts of a continuous fabric woven of the same threads and into the
                    same patterns from beginning to end. </p>
                <p>When she awoke, beautifully rested, her eyes clear and soft, the shadows which
                    had been long toward the southwest were long, though not so long, toward the
                    southeast. She sat up and smiled; it was so fine to be free! And her woes had
                    not in the least shaken that serene optimism which is youth's most delightful if
                    most dangerous possession. She crawled through the grass to the edge of the rock
                    and looked out through the screening leaves of the dense undergrowth. There was
                    no smoke from the chimney of the house. The woman, in a blue calico, was sitting
                    on the back doorstep knitting. Farther away, in fields here and there, a few
                    men&mdash;not a dozen in all&mdash;were at work. From a barnyard at the
                    far edge of the western horizon came the faint sound of a steam thresher, and
                    she thought she could see the men at work around it, but this might have been
                    illusion. It was a serene and lovely panorama of summer and country. Last of all
                    her eyes sought the glimpse of distant river. </p>
                <p>She ate two of her four eggs, put on the underclothes which were now thoroughly
                    sun-dried, shook out and <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0195" n="172"/> rebraided
                    her hair. Then she cast about for some way to pass the time. </p>
                <p>She explored the whole top of the rock, but that did not use up more than fifteen
                    minutes, as it was so small that every part was visible from every other part.
                    However, she found a great many wild flowers and gathered a huge bouquet of the
                    audacious colors of nature's gardens, so common yet so effective. She did a
                    little botanizing&mdash;anything to occupy her mind and keep it from the
                    ugly visions and fears. But all too soon she had exhausted the resources of her
                    hiding place. She looked down into the valley to the north&mdash;the valley
                    through which she had come. She might go down there and roam; it would be
                    something to do, and her young impatience of restraint was making her so
                    restless that she felt she could not endure the confines of that little rock. It
                    had seemed huge; a brief experience of freedom, a few hours between her and the
                    night's horrors and terrors, and it had shrunk to a tiny prison cell. Surely she
                    would run no risk in journeying through that trackless wilderness; she need not
                    be idle, she could hasten her destiny by following the creek in its lonely
                    wanderings, which must sooner or later bring it to the river. The river! </p>
                <p>She was about to get the two remaining eggs and abandon her stronghold when it
                    occurred to her that she would do well to take a last look all around. She went
                    back to the side of the rock facing the house. </p>
                <p>The woman had suspended knitting and was gazing intently across the hollow to the
                    west, where the road from the north entered the landscape. Susan turned her eyes
                    in that direction. Two horsemen at a gallop were moving southward. The girl was
                    well screened, but instinctively she drew still further back behind <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0196" n="173"/> the bushes&mdash;but not so far
                    that the two on horseback, riding so eagerly, were out of her view. The road
                    dipped into the hollow. the galloping horsemen disappeared with it. Susan
                    shifted her gaze to the point on the brow of the hill where the road reappeared.
                    She was quivering in every nerve. When they came into view again she would know. </p>
                <p>The place she was watching swam before her eyes. Suddenly the two, still at a
                    gallop, rose upon the crest of the hill. Jeb and her Uncle Zeke! Her vision
                    cleared, her nerve steadied. </p>
                <p>They did not draw rein until they were at the road gate of the little house. The
                    woman rose, put down her knitting in the seat of her stiff, rush-bottomed
                    rocker, advanced to the fence. The air was still, but Susan could not hear a
                    sound, though she craned forward and strained her ears to the uttermost. She
                    shrank as if she had been struck when the three began to gaze up at the
                    rock&mdash;to gaze, it seemed to her, at the very spot where she was
                    standing. Was her screen less thick than she thought? Had they seen&mdash;if
                    not her, perhaps part of her dress? </p>
                <p>Wildly her heart beat as Jeb dismounted from his horse the mare behind which she
                    had made her wedding journey&mdash;and stood in the gateway, talking with
                    the woman and looking toward the top of the rock. Zeke Warham turned his horse
                    and began to ride slowly away. He got as far as the brow of the hill, with Jeb
                    still in the gateway, hesitating. Then Susan heard: </p>
                <p>"Hold on, Mr. Warham. I reckon you're right." </p>
                <p>Warham halted his horse, Jeb remounted and joined him. As the woman returned
                    toward the back doorstep, the two men rode at a walk down into the hollow. When
                    they reappeared it was on the road by <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0197"/> which
                    they had come. And the girl knew the pursuit in that direction&mdash;the
                    right direction&mdash;was over. Trembling and with a fluttering in her
                    breast like the flapping of a bird's wings, she sank to the ground. Presently
                    she burst into a passion of tears. Without knowing why, she tore off the wedding
                    ring which until then she had forgotten, and flung it out among the treetops. A
                    few minutes, and she dried her eyes and stood up. The two horsemen were leaving
                    the landscape at the point at which they had entered it. The girl would not have
                    known, would have been frightened by, her own face had she seen it as she
                    watched them go out of her sight&mdash;out of her life. She did not
                    understand herself, for she was at that age when one is no more conscious of the
                    forces locked up within his unexplored and untested character than the dynamite
                    cartridge is of its secrets of power and terror. </p>
            </div1>

                <head> XI</head>
                <p> SHE felt free to go now. She walked toward the place where she had left the
                    eggs. It was on the side of the rock overlooking the creek. As she knelt to
                    remove the leaves, she heard from far below a man's voice singing. She leaned
                    forward and glanced down at the creek. In a moment appeared a young man with a
                    fishing rod and a bag slung over his shoulder. His gray and white striped
                    flannel trousers were rolled to his knees. His fair skin and the fair hair
                    waving about his forehead were exposed by the flapping-brimmed straw hat set
                    upon the back of his head. His voice, a strong and manly tenor, was sending up
                    those steeps a song she had never heard before&mdash;a song in Italian. She
                    had not seen what he looked like when she remembered herself and hastily fell
                    back from view. She dropped to the grass and crawled out toward the ledge. When
                    she showed her face it so happened that he was looking straight at her. </p>
                <p>"Hello!" he shouted. "That you, Nell?" </p>
                <p>Susan drew back, her blood in a tumult. From below, after a brief silence, came a
                    burst of laughter. </p>
                <p>She waited a long time, then through a shield of bunches of grass looked again.
                    The young man was gone. She wished that he had resumed his song, for she thought
                    she had never heard one so beautiful. Because she did not feel safe in
                    descending until he was well out of the way, and because she was so comfortable
                    lying there in the afternoon sunshine watching the birds and listening to them,
                    she continued on <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0199" n="176"/> there, glancing now
                    and then at where the creek entered and where it left her range of vision, to
                    make sure that no one else should come and catch her. Suddenly sounded a voice
                    from somewhere behind her: </p>
                <p>"Hey, Nell! I'm coming!" </p>
                <p>She sprang to her feet, faced about; and Crusoe was not more agitated when he saw
                    the print of the naked foot on his island's strand. The straw hat with the
                    flapping brim was just lifting above the edge of the rock at the opposite side,
                    where the path was. She could not escape; the shelf offered no hiding place. Now
                    the young man was stepping to the level, panting loudly. </p>
                <p>"Gee, what a climb for a hot day!" he cried. "Where are you?" </p>
                <p>With that he was looking at Susan, less than twenty yards away and drawn up
                    defiantly. He stared, took off his hat. He had close-cropped wavy hair and eyes
                    as gray as Susan's own, but it was a blue-gray instead of violet. His skin was
                    fair, too, and his expression intelligent and sympathetic. In spite of his hat,
                    and his blue cotton shirt, and trousers rolled high on bare sunburned legs,
                    there was nothing of the yokel about him. </p>
                <p>"I beg your pardon," he exclaimed half humorously. "I thought it was my cousin
                    Nell." </p>
                <p>"No," said Susan, disarmed by his courtesy and by the frank engaging manner of
                    it. </p>
                <p>"I didn't mean to intrude." He showed white teeth in a broad smile. "I see from
                    your face that this is your private domain." </p>
                <p>"Oh, no&mdash;not at all," stammered Susan. </p>
                <p>"Yes, I insist," replied he. "Will you let me stay <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0200" n="177"/> and rest a minute? I ran round the
                    rock and climbed pretty fast." </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;do," said Susan. </p>
                <p>The young man sat on the grass near where he had appeared, and crossed his long
                    legs. The girl, much embarrassed, looked uneasily about. "Perhaps you'd sit,
                    too?" suggested he, after eyeing her in a friendly way that could not cause
                    offense and somehow did not cause any great uneasiness. </p>
                <p>Susan hesitated, went to the shadow of a little tree not far from him. He was
                    fanning his flushed face with his hat. The collar of his shirt was open; below,
                    where the tan ended abruptly, his skin was beautifully white. Now that she had
                    been discovered, it was as well to be pleasant, she reasoned. "It's a fine day,"
                    she observed with a grown-up gravity that much amused him. </p>
                <p>"Not for fishing," said he. "I caught nothing. You are a stranger in these
                    parts?" </p>
                <p>Susan colored and a look of terror flitted into her eyes. "Yes," she admitted.
                    "I'm&mdash;I'm passing through." </p>
                <p>The young man had all he could do to conceal his amusement. Susan flushed deeply
                    again, not because she saw his expression, for she was not looking at him, but
                    because her remark seemed to her absurd and likely to rouse suspicion. </p>
                <p>"I suppose you came up here to see the view," said the man. He glanced round. "It
                    _is_ pretty good. You're not visiting down Brooksburg way, by any chance?" </p>
                <p>"No," replied Susan, rather composedly and determined to change the subject.
                    "What was that song I heard you singing?" </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0201" n="178"/>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;you heard, did you?" laughed he. "It's the Duke's song from
                    `Rigoletto.'" </p>
                <p>"That's an opera, isn't it&mdash;like `Trovatore'?" </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;an Italian opera. Same author." </p>
                <p>"It's a beautiful song." It was evident that she longed to ask him to sing it.
                    She felt at ease with him; he was so unaffected and simple, was one of those
                    people who seem to be at home wherever they are. </p>
                <p>"Do you sing?" he inquired. </p>
                <p>"Not really," replied she. </p>
                <p>"Neither do I. So if you'll sing to me, I'll sing to you." </p>
                <p>Susan looked round in alarm. "Oh, dear, no&mdash;please don't," she cried. </p>
                <p>"Why not?" he asked curiously. "There isn't a soul about." </p>
                <p>"I know&mdash;but&mdash;really, you mustn't." </p>
                <p>"Very well," said he, seeing that her nervousness was not at all from being asked
                    to sing. They sat quietly, she gazing off at the horizon, he fanning himself and
                    studying her lovely young face. He was somewhere in the neighborhood of
                    twenty-five and a close observer would have suspected him of an unusual amount
                    of experience, even for a good-looking, expansive youth of that age. </p>
                <p>He broke the long silence. "I'm a newspaper man from Cincinnati. I'm on the
                    _Commercial_ there. My name's Roderick Spenser. My father's Clayton Spenser,
                    down at Brooksburg"&mdash;he pointed to the southeast&mdash;"beyond that
                    hill there, on the river. I'm here on my vacation." And he halted, looking at
                    her expectantly. </p>
                <p>It seemed to her that there was in courtesy no escape <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0202" n="179"/> without a return biographical sketch.
                    She hung her head, twisted her tapering fingers in her lap, and looked
                    childishly embarrassed and unhappy. Another long silence; again he broke it.
                    "You'll pardon my saying so, but&mdash;you're very young, aren't you?" </p>
                <p>"Not so&mdash;so _terribly_ young. I'm almost seventeen," replied she,
                    glancing this way and that, as if thinking of flight. </p>
                <p>"You look like a child, yet you don't," he went on, and his frank, honest voice
                    calmed her. "You've had some painful experience, I'd say." </p>
                <p>She nodded, her eyes down. </p>
                <p>A pause, then he: "Honest, now&mdash;aren't you&mdash;running away?" </p>
                <p>She lifted her eyes to his piteously. "Please don't ask me," she said. </p>
                <p>"I shouldn't think of it," replied he, with a gentleness in his persistence that
                    made her feel still more like trusting him, "if it wasn't that&mdash; </p>
                <p>"Well, this world isn't the easiest sort of a place. Lots of rough stretches in
                    the road. I've struck several and I've always been glad when somebOdy has given
                    me a lift. And I want to pass it on&mdash;if you'll let me. It's something
                    we owe each other&mdash;don't you think?" </p>
                <p>The words were fine enough; but it was the voice in which he said them that went
                    to her heart. She covered her face with her hands and released her pent
                    emotions. He took a package of tobacco and a sheaf of papers from his trousers
                    pocket, rolled and lighted a cigarette. After a while she dried her eyes, looked
                    at him shamefacedly. But he was all understanding and sympathy. </p>
                <p>"Now you feel better, don't you?" </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0203" n="180"/>

                <p>"Much," said she. And she laughed. "I guess I'm more upset than I let myself
                    realize." </p>
                <p>"Sorry you left home?" </p>
                <p>"I haven't any home," answered she simply. "And I wouldn't go back alive to the
                    place I came from." </p>
                <p>There was a quality in the energy she put into her words that made him
                    thoughtful. He counseled with the end of his cigarette. Finally he inquired: </p>
                <p>"Where are you bound for?" </p>
                <p>"I don't know exactly," confessed she, as if it were a small matter. </p>
                <p>He shook his head. "I see you haven't the faintest notion what you're up
                    against." </p>
                <p>"Oh, I'll get along. I'm strong, and I can learn." </p>
                <p>He looked at her critically and rather sadly. </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;you are strong," said he. "But I wonder if you're strong enough." </p>
                <p>"I never was sick in my life." </p>
                <p>"I don't mean that. . . . I'm not sure I know just what I do mean." </p>
                <p>"Is it very hard to get to Chicago?" inquired she. </p>
                <p>"It's easier to get to Cincinnati." </p>
                <p>She shook her head positively. "It wouldn't do for me to go there." </p>
                <p>"Oh, you come from Cincinnati?" </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;but I&mdash;I've been there." </p>
                <p>"Oh, they caught you and brought you back?" </p>
                <p>She nodded. This young man must be very smart to understand so quickly. </p>
                <p>"How much money have you got?" he asked abruptly. </p>
                <p>But his fear that she would think him impertinent came of an underestimate of her
                    innocence. "I haven't <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0204" n="181"/> got any,"
                    replied she. "I forgot my purse. It had thirty dollars in it." </p>
                <p>At once he recognized the absolute child; only utter inexperience of the world
                    could speak of so small a sum so respectfully. "I don't understand at all," said
                    he. "How long have you been here?" </p>
                <p>"All day. I got here early this morning." </p>
                <p>"And you haven't had anything to eat!" </p>
                <p>"Oh, yes! I found some eggs. I've got two left." </p>
                <p>Two eggs&mdash;and no money and no friends&mdash;and a woman. Yet she was
                    facing the future hopefully! He smiled, with tears in his eyes. </p>
                <p>"You mustn't tell anybody you saw me," she went on. "No matter what they say,
                    don't think you ought to tell on me." </p>
                <p>He looked at her, she at him. When he had satisfied himself he smiled most
                    reassuringly. "I'll not," was his answer, and now she _knew_ she could trust
                    him. </p>
                <p>She drew a breath of relief, and went on as if talking with an old friend. "I've
                    got to get a long ways from here. As soon as it's dark I'm going." </p>
                <p>"Where?" </p>
                <p>"Toward the river." And her eyes lit. </p>
                <p>"The river? What's there?" </p>
                <p>"I don't know," said she triumphantly. </p>
                <p>But he understood. He had the spirit of adventure himself&mdash;one could see
                    it at a glance&mdash;the spirit that instinctively shuns yesterday and all
                    its works and wings eagerly into tomorrow, unknown, different,
                    new&mdash;therefore better. But this girl, this child-woman&mdash;or was
                    she rather woman-child?&mdash;penniless, with nothing but two eggs between
                    her and starvation, alone, without plans, without experience&mdash; </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0205" n="182"/>

                <p>What would become of her?. . . "Aren't you&mdash;afraid?" he asked. </p>
                <p>"Of what?" she inquired calmly. </p>
                <p>It was the mere unconscious audacity of ignorance, yet he saw in her
                    now&mdash;not fancied he saw, but saw&mdash;a certain strength of soul,
                    both courage and tenacity. No, she might suffer, sink&mdash;but she would
                    die fighting, and she would not be afraid. And he admired and envied her. </p>
                <p>"Oh, I'll get along somehow," she assured him in the same self-reliant tone.
                    Suddenly she felt it would no longer give her the horrors to speak of what she
                    had been through. "I'm not very old," said she, and hers was the face of a woman
                    now. "But I've learned a great deal." </p>
                <p>"You are sure you are not making a mistake in&mdash;in&mdash;running
                    away?" </p>
                <p>"I couldn't do anything else," replied she. "I'm all alone in the world. There's
                    no one&mdash;except&mdash; </p>
                <p>"I hadn't done anything, and they said I had disgraced them&mdash;and
                    they&mdash;" Her voice faltered, her eyes sank, the color flooded into her
                    face. "They gave me to a man&mdash;and he&mdash;I had hardly seen him
                    before&mdash;he&mdash;" She tried but could not pronounce the dreadful
                    word. </p>
                <p>"Married, you mean?" said the young man gently. </p>
                <p>The girl shuddered. "Yes," she answered. "And I ran away." </p>
                <p>So strange, so startling, so moving was the expression of her face that he could
                    not speak for a moment. A chill crept over him as he watched her wide eyes
                    gazing into vacancy. What vision of horror was she seeing, he wondered. To rouse
                    her he spoke the first words he could assemble: </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0206" n="183"/>
                <p>"When was this?" </p>
                <p>The vision seemed slowly to fade and she looked at him in astonishment. "Why, it
                    was last night!" she said, as if dazed by the discovery. "Only last night!" </p>
                <p>"Last night! Then you haven't got far." </p>
                <p>"No. But I must. I will. And I'm not afraid of anything except of being taken
                    back." </p>
                <p>"But you don't realize what may be&mdash;probably is&mdash;waiting for
                    you&mdash;at the river&mdash;and beyond." </p>
                <p>"Nothing could be so bad," said she. The words were nothing, but the tone and the
                    expression that accompanied them somehow convinced him beyond a doubt. </p>
                <p>"You'll let me help you?" </p>
                <p>She debated. "You might bring me something to eat&mdash;mightn't you? The
                    eggs'll do for supper. But there's tomorrow. I don't want to be seen till I get
                    a long ways off." </p>
                <p>He rose at once. "Yes, I'll bring you something to eat." He took a knockabout
                    watch from the breast pocket of his shirt. "It's now four o'clock. I've got
                    three miles to walk. I'll ride back and hitch the horse down the
                    creek&mdash;a little ways down, so it won't attract attention to your place
                    up here. I'll be back in about an hour and a half. . . . Maybe I'll think of
                    something that'll help. Can I bring you anything else? </p>
                <p>"No. That is&mdash;I'd like a little piece of soap." </p>
                <p>"And a towel?" he suggested. </p>
                <p>"I could take care of a towel," agreed she. "I'll send it back to you when I get
                    settled." </p>
                <p>"Good heavens!" He laughed at her simplicity. "What an honest child you are!" He
                    put out his hand, and she took it with charming friendliness. "Good-by. I'll
                    hurry." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0207" n="184"/>

                <p>"I'm so glad you caught me," said she. Then, apologetically, "I don't want to be
                    any trouble. I hate to be troublesome. I've never let anybody wait on me." </p>
                <p>"I don't know when I've had as much pleasure as this is giving me." And he made a
                    bow that hid its seriousness behind a smile of good-humored raillery. </p>
                <p>She watched him descend with a sinking heart. The rock&mdash;the
                    world&mdash;her life, seemed empty now. He had reminded her that there were
                    human beings with good hearts. But&mdash;perhaps if he knew, his kindness
                    would turn also. . . . No, she decided not. Men like him, women like Aunt
                    Sallie&mdash;they did not believe those dreadful, wicked ideas that people
                    said God had ordained. Still&mdash;if he knew about her
                    birth&mdash;branded outcast&mdash;he might change. She must not really
                    hope for anything much until she was far, far away in a wholly new world where
                    there would be a wholly new sort of people, of a kind she had never met. But she
                    was sure they would welcome her, and give her a chance. </p>
                <p>She returned to the tree against which she had been sitting, for there she could
                    look at the place his big frame had pressed down in the tall grass, and could
                    see him in it, and could recall his friendly eyes and voice, and could keep
                    herself assured she had not been dreaming. He was a citified man, like
                    Sam&mdash;but how different! A man with a heart like his would never marry a
                    woman&mdash;no, never! He couldn't be a brute like that. Still, perhaps nice
                    men married because it was supposed to be the right thing to do, and was the
                    only way to have children without people thinking you a disgrace and slighting
                    the children&mdash;and then marrying made brutes of them. No wonder <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0208" n="185"/> her uncles could treat her so. They
                    were men who had married. </p>
                <p>Afar off she heard the manly voice singing the song from "Rigoletto." She sprang
                    up and listened, with eyes softly shining and head a little on one side. The
                    song ended; her heart beat fast. It was not many minutes before she, watching at
                    the end of the path, saw him appear at the bottom of the huge cleft. And the
                    look in his eyes, the merry smile about his expressive mouth, delighted her.
                    "I'm so glad to see you!" she cried. </p>
                <p>Over his shoulder was flung his fishing bag, and it bulged. "Don't be scared by
                    the size of my pack," he called up, as he climbed. "We're going to have supper
                    together&mdash;if you'll let me stay. Then you can take as much or as little
                    as you like of what's left." </p>
                <p>Arrived at the top, he halted for a long breath. They stood facing each other.
                    "My, what a tall girl you are for your age!" said he admiringly. </p>
                <p>She laughed up at him. "I'll be as tall as you when I get my growth." </p>
                <p>She was so lovely that he could scarcely refrain from telling her so. It seemed
                    to him, however, it would be taking an unfair advantage to say that sort of
                    thing when she was in a way at his mercy. "Where shall we spread the table?"
                    said he. "I'm hungry as the horseleech's daughter. And you&mdash;why, you
                    must be starved. I'm afraid I didn't bring what you like. But I did the best I
                    could. I raided the pantry, took everything that was portable." </p>
                <p>He had set down the bag and had loosened its strings. First he took out a
                    tablecloth. She laughed. "Gracious! How stylish we shall be!" </p>
                <p>"I didn't bring napkins. We can use the corners <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0209"
                        n="186"/> of the cloth." He had two knives, two forks, and a big spoon
                    rolled up in the cloth, and a saltcellar. "Now, here's my triumph!" he cried,
                    drawing from the bag a pair of roasted chickens. Next came a jar of quince
                    jelly; next, a paper bag with cold potatoes and cold string beans in it. Then he
                    fished out a huge square of cornbread and a loaf of salt-rising bread, a pound
                    of butter&mdash; </p>
                <p>"What will your folks say?" exclaimed she, in dismay. </p>
                <p>He laughed. "They always have thought I was crazy, ever since I went to college
                    and then to the city instead of farming." And out of the bag came a big glass
                    jar of milk. "I forgot to bring a glass!" he apologized. Then he suspended
                    unpacking to open the jar. "Why, you must be half-dead with thirst, up here all
                    day with not a drop of water." And he held out the jar to her. "Drink hearty!"
                    he cried. </p>
                <p>The milk was rich and cold; she drank nearly a fourth of it before she could
                    wrest the jar away from her lips. "My, but that was good!" she remarked. He had
                    enjoyed watching her drink. "Surely you haven't got anything else in that bag?" </p>
                <p>"Not much," replied he. "Here's a towel, wrapped round the soap. And here are
                    three cakes of chocolate. You could live four or five days on them, if you were
                    put to it. So whatever else you leave, don't leave them. And&mdash;Oh, yes,
                    here's a calico slip and a sunbonnet, and a paper of pins. And that's all." </p>
                <p>"What are they for?" </p>
                <p>"I thought you might put them on&mdash;the slip over your dress&mdash;and
                    you wouldn't look quite so&mdash;so out of place&mdash;if anybody should
                    see you." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0210" n="187"/>

                <p>"What a fine idea!" cried Susan, shaking out the slip delightedly. </p>
                <p>He was spreading the supper on the tablecloth. He carved one of the chickens,
                    opened the jelly, placed the bread and vegetables and butter. "Now!" he cried.
                    "Let's get busy." </p>
                <p>And he set her an example she was not slow to follow. The sun had slipped down
                    behind the hills of the northwest horizon. The birds were tuning for their
                    evening song. A breeze sprang up and coquetted with the strays of her wavy dark
                    hair. And they sat cross-legged on the grass on opposite sides of the tablecloth
                    and joked and laughed and ate, and ate and laughed and joked until the stars
                    began to appear in the vast paling opal of the sky. They had chosen the center
                    of the grassy platform for their banquet; thus, from where they sat only the
                    tops of trees and the sky were to be seen. And after they had finished she
                    leaned on her elbow and listened while he, smoking his cigarette, told her of
                    his life as a newspaper man in Cincinnati. The twilight faded into dusk, the
                    dusk into a scarlet darkness. </p>
                <p>"When the moon comes up we'll start," said he. "You can ride behind me on the
                    horse part of the way, anyhow." </p>
                <p>The shadow of the parting, the ending of this happiness, fell upon her. How
                    lonely it would be when he was gone! "I haven't told you my name," she said. </p>
                <p>"I've told you mine Roderick Spenser&mdash;with an _s_, not a _c_." </p>
                <p>"I remember," said she. "I'll never forget. . . . Mine's Susan Lenox." </p>
                <p>"What was it&mdash;before&mdash;" He halted. </p>
                <p>"Before what?" His silence set her to thinking. <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0211"
                        n="188"/> "Oh!" she exclaimed, in a tone that made him curse his stupidity
                    in reminding her. "My name's Susan Lenox&mdash;and always will be. It was my
                    mother's name." She hesitated, decided for frankness at any cost, for his
                    kindness forbade her to deceive him in any way. Proudly, "My mother never let
                    any man marry her. They say she was disgraced, but I understand now. _She_
                    wouldn't stoop to let any man marry her." </p>
                <p>Spenser puzzled over this, but could make nothing of it. He felt that he ought
                    not to inquire further. He saw her anxious eyes, her expression of one keyed up
                    and waiting for a verdict. "I'd have only to look at you to know your mother was
                    a fine woman," said he. Then, to escape from the neighborhood of the dangerous
                    riddle, "Now, about your&mdash;your going," he began. "I've been thinking
                    what to do." </p>
                <p>"You'll help me?" said she, to dispel her last doubt&mdash;a very faint
                    doubt, for his words and his way of uttering them had dispelled her real
                    anxiety. </p>
                <p>"Help you?" cried he heartily. "All I can. I've got a scheme to propose to you.
                    You say you can't take the mail boat?" </p>
                <p>"They know me. I&mdash;I'm from Sutherland." </p>
                <p>"You trust me&mdash;don't you?" </p>
                <p>"Indeed I do." </p>
                <p>"Now listen to me&mdash;as if I were your brother. Will you?" </p>
                <p>"Yes." </p>
                <p>"I'm going to take you to Cincinnati with me. I'm going to put you in my boarding
                    house as my sister. And I'm going to get you a position. Then&mdash;you can
                    start in for yourself." </p>
                <p>"But that'll be a great lot of trouble, won't it?" </p>
                <p>"Not any more than friends of mine took for me <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0212"
                        n="189"/> when I was starting out." Then, as she continued silent, "What are
                    you thinking? I can't see your face in this starlight." </p>
                <p>"I was thinking how good you are," she said simply. </p>
                <p>He laughed uneasily. "I'm not often accused of that," he replied. "I'm like most
                    people&mdash;a mixture of good and bad&mdash;and not very strong either
                    way. I'm afraid I'm mostly impulse that winks out. But&mdash;the question
                    is, how to get you to Cincinnati. It's simply impossible for me to go tonight. I
                    can't take you home for the night. I don't trust my people. They'd not think I
                    was good&mdash;or you, either. And while usually they'd be
                    right&mdash;both ways&mdash;this is an exception." This idea of an
                    exception seemed to amuse him. He went on, "I don't dare leave you at any
                    farmhouse in the neighborhood. If I did, you could be traced." </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;no," she cried, alarmed at the very suggestion. "I mustn't be seen
                    by anybody." </p>
                <p>"We'll go straight to the river, and I'll get a boat and row you across to
                    Kentucky&mdash;over to Carrollton. There's a little hotel. I can leave
                    you&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;not Carrollton," she interrupted. "My uncle sells goods there, and
                    they know him. And if anything is in the Sutherland papers about me, why, they'd
                    know." </p>
                <p>"Not with you in that slip and sunbonnet. I'll make up a story&mdash;about
                    our wagon breaking down and that I've got to walk back into the hills to get
                    another before we can go on. And&mdash;it's the only plan that's at all
                    possible." </p>
                <p>Obviously he was right; but she would not consent. By adroit questioning he found
                    that her objection was dislike of being so much trouble to him. "That's too <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0213" n="190"/> ridiculous," cried he. "Why, I
                    wouldn't have missed this adventure for anything in the world." </p>
                <p>His manner was convincing enough, but she did not give in until moonrise came
                    without her having thought of any other plan. He was to be Bob Peters, she his
                    sister Kate, and they were to hail from a farm in the Kentucky hills back of
                    Milton. They practiced the dialect of the region and found that they could talk
                    it well enough to pass the test of a few sentences They packed the fishing bag;
                    she wrapped the two eggs in paper and put them in the empty milk bottle. They
                    descended by the path&mdash;a slow journey in the darkness of that side of
                    the rock, as there were many dangers, including the danger of making a noise
                    that might be heard by some restless person at the house. After half an hour
                    they were safely at the base of the rock; they skirted it, went down to the
                    creek, found the horse tied where he had left it. With her seated sideways
                    behind him and holding on by an arm half round his waist, they made a merry but
                    not very speedy advance toward the river, keeping as nearly due south as the
                    breaks in the hills permitted. After a while he asked: "Do you ever think of the
                    stage?" </p>
                <p>"I've never seen a real stage play," said she. "But I want to&mdash;and I
                    will, the first chance I get." </p>
                <p>"I meant, did you ever think of going on the stage?" </p>
                <p>"No." So daring a flight would have been impossible for a baby imagination in the
                    cage of the respectable-family-in-a-small-town. </p>
                <p>"It's one of my dreams to write plays," he went on. "Wouldn't it be queer if some
                    day I wrote plays for you to act in?" </p>
                <p>When one's fancy is as free as was Susan's then, it takes any direction chance
                    may suggest. Susan's <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0214" n="191"/> fancy instantly
                    winged along this fascinating route. "I've given recitations at school, and in
                    the plays we used to have they let me take the best parts&mdash;that
                    is&mdash;until&mdash;until a year or so ago." </p>
                <p>He noted the hesitation, had an instinct against asking why there had come a time
                    when she no longer got good parts. "I'm sure you could learn to act," declared
                    he. "And you'll be sure of it, too, after you've seen the people who do it." </p>
                <p>"Oh, I don't believe I could," said she, in rebuke to her own mounting
                    self-confidence. Then, suddenly remembering her birth-brand of shame and
                    overwhelmed by it, "No, I can't hope to be to be anything much. They wouldn't
                    have&mdash;_me_." </p>
                <p>"I know how you feel," replied he, all unaware of the real reason for this deep
                    humility. "When I first struck town I felt that way. It seemed to me I couldn't
                    hope ever to line up with the clever people they had there. But I soon saw there
                    was nothing in that idea. The fact is, everywhere in the world there's a lot
                    more things to do than people who can do them. Most of those who get to the
                    top&mdash;where did they start? Where we're starting." </p>
                <p>She was immensely flattered by that "we" and grateful for it. But she held to her
                    original opinion. "There wouldn't be a chance for me," said she. "They wouldn't
                    have me." </p>
                <p>"Oh, I understand," said he and he fancied he did. He laughed gayly at the idea
                    that in the theater anyone would care who she was&mdash;what kind of past
                    she had had&mdash;or present either, for that matter. Said he, "You needn't
                    worry. On the stage they don't ask any questions&mdash;any questions except
                    `Can you act? Can you get it over? Can you get the hand?'" </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0215" n="192"/>
                <p>Then this stage, it was the world she had dreamed of&mdash;the world where
                    there lived a wholly new kind of people&mdash;people who could make room for
                    her. She thrilled, and her heart beat wildly. In a strangely quiet, intense
                    voice, she said: </p>
                <p>"I want to try. I'm sure I'll get along there. I'll work&mdash;Oh, so hard.
                    I'll do _anything!_" </p>
                <p>"That's the talk," cried he. "You've got the stuff in you." </p>
                <p>She said little the rest of the journey. Her mind was busy with the idea he had
                    by merest accident given her. If he could have looked in upon her thoughts, he
                    would have been amazed and not a little alarmed by the ferment he had set up. </p>
                <p>Where they reached the river the bank was mud and thick willows, the haunt of
                    incredible armies of mosquitoes. "It's a mystery to me," cried he, "why these
                    fiends live in lonely places far away from blood, when they're so mad about it."
                    After some searching he found a clear stretch of sandy gravel where she would be
                    not too uncomfortable while he was gone for a boat. He left the horse with her
                    and walked upstream in the direction of Brooksburg. As he had warned her that he
                    might be gone a long time, he knew she would not be alarmed for
                    him&mdash;and she had already proved that timidity about herself was not in
                    her nature. But he was alarmed for her&mdash;this girl alone in that lonely
                    darkness&mdash;with light enough to make her visible to any prowler. </p>
                <p>About an hour after he left her he returned in a rowboat he had borrowed at the
                    water mill. He hitched the horse in the deep shadow of the break in the bank.
                    She got into the boat, put on the slip and the sunbonnet, put her sailor hat in
                    the bag. They pushed <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0216"/> off and he began the
                    long hard row across and upstream. The moon was high now and was still near
                    enough to its full glory to pour a flood of beautiful light upon the broad
                    river&mdash;the lovely Ohio at its loveliest part. </p>
                <p>"Won't you sing?" he asked. </p>
                <p>And without hesitation she began one of the simple familiar love songs that were
                    all the music to which the Sutherland girls had access. She sang softly, in a
                    deep sweet voice, sweeter even than her speaking voice. She had the sunbonnet in
                    her lap; the moon shone full upon her face. And it seemed to him that he was in
                    a dream; there was nowhere a suggestion of reality&mdash;not of its prose,
                    not even of its poetry. Only in the land no waking eye has seen could such a
                    thing be. The low sweet voice sang of love, the oars clicked rhythmically in the
                    locks and clove the water with musical splash; the river, between its steep
                    hills, shone in the moonlight, with a breeze like a friendly spirit moving upon
                    its surface. He urged her, and she sang another song, and another. She sighed
                    when she saw the red lantern on the Carrollton wharf; and he, turning his head
                    and seeing, echoed her sigh. </p>
                <p>"The first chance, you must sing me that song," she said. </p>
                <p>"From `Rigoletto'? I will. But&mdash;it tells how fickle women
                    are&mdash;`like a feather in the wind.'. . . They aren't all like that,
                    though&mdash;don't you think so?" </p>
                <p>"Sometimes I think everybody's like a feather in the wind," replied she. "About
                    love&mdash;and everything." </p>
                <p>He laughed. "Except those people who are where there isn't any wind." </p>

                <head> XII</head>
                <p> FOR some time Spenser had been rowing well in toward the Kentucky shore, to
                    avoid the swift current of the Kentucky River which rushes into the Ohio at
                    Carrollton. A few yards below its mouth, in the quiet stretch of backwater along
                    shore, lay the wharf-boat, little more than a landing stage. The hotel was but a
                    hundred feet away, at the top of the steep levee. It was midnight, so everyone
                    in the village had long been asleep. After several minutes of thunderous
                    hammering Roderick succeeded in drawing to the door a barefooted man with a
                    candle in his huge, knotted hand&mdash;a man of great stature, amazingly
                    lean and long of leg, with a monstrous head thatched and fronted with coarse,
                    yellow-brown hair. He had on a dirty cotton shirt and dirty cotton
                    trousers&mdash;a night dress that served equally well for the day. His feet
                    were flat and thick and were hideous with corns and bunions. Susan had early
                    been made a critical observer of feet by the unusual symmetry of her own. She
                    had seen few feet that were fit to be seen; but never, she thought, had she seen
                    an exhibition so repellent. </p>
                <p>"What t'hell&mdash;" he began. Then, discovering Susan, he growled, "Beg
                    pardon, miss." </p>
                <p>Roderick explained&mdash;that is, told the prearranged story. The man pointed
                    to a grimy register on the office desk, and Roderick set down the fishing bag
                    and wrote in a cramped, scrawly hand, "Kate Peters, Milton, Ky." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0218" n="195"/>
                <p>The man looked at it through his screen of hair and beard, said, "Come on,
                    ma'am." </p>
                <p>"Just a minute," said Roderick, and he drew "Kate" aside and said to her in a low
                    tone: "I'll be back sometime tomorrow, and then we'll start at once.
                    But&mdash;to provide against everything&mdash;don't be alarmed if I
                    don't come. You'll know I couldn't help it. And wait." </p>
                <p>Susan nodded, looking at him with trustful, grateful eyes. </p>
                <p>"And," he went on hurriedly, "I'll leave this with you, to take care of. It's
                    yours as much as mine." </p>
                <p>She saw that it was a pocketbook, instinctively put her hands behind her. </p>
                <p>"Don't be silly," he said, with good-humored impatience. "You'll probably not
                    need it. If you do, you'll need it bad. And you'll pay me back when you get your
                    place." </p>
                <p>He caught one of her hands and put the pocketbook in it. As his argument was
                    unanswerable, she did not resist further. She uttered not a word of thanks, but
                    simply looked at him, her eyes swimming and about her mouth a quiver that meant
                    a great deal in her. Impulsively and with flaming cheek he kissed her on the
                    cheek. "So long, sis," he said loudly, and strode into the night. </p>
                <p>Susan did not flush; she paled. She gazed after him with some such expression as
                    a man lost in a cave might have as he watches the flickering out of his only
                    light. "This way, ma'am," said the hotel man sourly, taking up the fishing bag.
                    She started, followed him up the noisy stairs to a plain, neat country bedroom.
                    "The price of this here's one fifty a day," said he. "We've got 'em as low as a
                    dollar." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0219" n="196"/>
                <p>"I'll take a dollar one, please," said Susan. </p>
                <p>The man hesitated. "Well," he finally snarled, "business is slack jes' now.
                    Seein' as you're a lady, you kin have this here un fur a dollar." </p>
                <p>"Oh, thank you&mdash;but if the price is more&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"The other rooms ain't fit fur a lady," said the hotel man. Then he grinned a
                    very human humorous grin that straightway made him much less repulsive. "Anyhow,
                    them two durn boys of mine an' their cousins is asleep in 'em. I'd as lief rout
                    out a nest of hornets. I'll leave you the candle." </p>
                <p>As soon as he had gone Susan put out the light, ran to the window. She saw the
                    rowboat and Spenser, a black spot far out on the river, almost gone from view to
                    the southwest. Hastily she lighted the candle again, stood at the window and
                    waved a white cover she snatched from the table. She thought she saw one of the
                    oars go up and flourish, but she could not be sure. She watched until the boat
                    vanished in the darkness at the bend. She found the soap in the bag and took a
                    slow but thorough bath in the washbowl. Then she unbraided her hair, combed it
                    out as well as she could with her fingers, rubbed it thoroughly with a towel and
                    braided it again. She put on the calico slip as a nightdress, knelt down to say
                    her prayers. But instead of prayers there came flooding into her mind memories
                    of where she had been last night, of the horrors, of the agonies of body and
                    soul. She rose from her knees, put out the light, stood again at the window. In
                    after years she always looked back upon that hour as the one that definitely
                    marked the end of girlhood, of the thoughts and beliefs which go with the
                    sheltered life, and the beginning of womanhood, of self-reliance and of the
                    hardiness&mdash;so near akin to <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0220" n="197"/>
                    hardness&mdash;the hardiness that must come into the character before a man
                    or a woman is fit to give and take in the combat of life. </p>
                <p>The bed was coarse, but white and clean. She fell asleep instantly and did not
                    awaken until, after the vague, gradually louder sound of hammering on the door,
                    she heard a female voice warning her that breakfast was "put nigh over an'
                    done." She got up, partly drew on one stocking, then without taking it off
                    tumbled over against the pillow and was asleep. When she came to herself again,
                    the lay of the shadows told her it must be after twelve o'clock. She dressed,
                    packed her serge suit in the bag with the sailor hat, smoothed out the pink
                    calico slip and put it on. For more than a year she had worn her hair in a braid
                    doubled upon itself and tied with a bow at the back of her neck. She decided
                    that if she would part it, plait it in two braids and bring them round her head,
                    she would look older. She tried this and was much pleased with the result. She
                    thought the new style not only more grown-up, but also more becoming. The pink
                    slip, too, seemed to her a success. It came almost to her ankles and its strings
                    enabled her to make it look something like a dress. Carrying the pink sunbonnet,
                    down she went in search of something to eat. </p>
                <p>The hall was full of smoke and its air seemed greasy with the odor of frying. She
                    found that dinner was about to be served. A girl in blue calico skirt and
                    food-smeared, sweat-discolored blue jersey ushered her to one of the tables in
                    the dining-room. "There's a gentleman comin'," said she. "I'll set him down with
                    you. He won't bite, I don't reckon, and there ain't no use mussin' up two
                    tables." </p>
                <p>There was no protesting against two such arguments; <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0221" n="198"/> so Susan presently had opposite her a
                    fattish man with long oily hair and a face like that of a fallen and dissipated
                    preacher. She recognized him at once as one of those wanderers who visit small
                    towns with cheap shows or selling patent medicines and doing juggling tricks on
                    the street corners in the flare of a gasoline lamp. She eyed him furtively until
                    he caught her at it&mdash;he being about the same business himself.
                    Thereafter she kept her eyes steadily upon the tablecloth, patched and worn thin
                    with much washing. Soon the plate of each was encircled by the familiar arc of
                    side dishes containing assorted and not very appetizing messes&mdash;fried
                    steak, watery peas, stringy beans, soggy turnips, lumpy mashed potatoes, a
                    perilous-looking chicken stew, cornbread with streaks of baking soda in it. But
                    neither of the diners was critical, and the dinner was eaten with an enthusiasm
                    which the best rarely inspires. </p>
                <p>With the prunes and dried-apple pie, the stranger expanded. "Warm day, miss," he
                    ventured. </p>
                <p>"Yes, it is a little warm," said Susan. She ventured a direct look at him. Above
                    the pleasant, kindly eyes there was a brow so unusually well shaped that it
                    arrested even her young and untrained attention. Whatever the man's character or
                    station, there could be no question as to his intelligence. </p>
                <p>"The flies are very bothersome," continued he. "But nothing like Australia. There
                    the flies have to be picked off, and they're big, and they bite&mdash;take a
                    piece right out of you. The natives used to laugh at us when we were in the ring
                    and would try to brush, em away." The stranger had the pleasant, easy manner of
                    one who through custom of all kinds of people and all varieties of fortune, has
                    learned to be patient and <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0222" n="199"/>
                    good-humored&mdash;to take the day and the hour as the seasoned gambler
                    takes the cards that are dealt him. </p>
                <p>Susan said nothing; but she had listened politely. The man went on amusing
                    himself with his own conversation. "I was in the show business then. Clown was
                    my line, but I was rotten at it&mdash;simply rotten. I'm still in the show
                    business&mdash;different line, though. I've got a show of my own. If you're
                    going to be in town perhaps you'll come to see us tonight. Our boat's anchored
                    down next to the wharf. You can see it from the windows. Come, and bring your
                    folks." </p>
                <p>"Thank you," said Susan&mdash;she had for gotten her role and its accent.
                    "But I'm afraid we'll not be here." </p>
                <p>There was an expression in the stranger's face&mdash;a puzzled, curious
                    expression, not impertinent, rather covert&mdash;an expression that made her
                    uneasy. It warned her that this man saw she was not what she seemed to be, that
                    he was trying to peer into her secret. His brown eyes were kind enough, but
                    alarmingly keen. With only half her pie eaten, she excused herself and hastened
                    to her room. </p>
                <p>At the threshold she remembered the pocketbook Spenser had given her. She had
                    left it by the fishing bag on the table. There was the bag but not the
                    pocketbook. "I must have put it in the bag," she said aloud, and the sound and
                    the tone of her voice frightened her. She searched the bag, then the room which
                    had not yet been straightened up. She shook out the bed covers, looked in all
                    the drawers, under the bed, went over the contents of the bag again. The
                    pocketbook was gone&mdash;stolen. </p>
                <p>She sat down on the edge of the bed, her hands in <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0223" n="200"/> her lap, and stared at the place
                    where she had last seen the pocketbook&mdash;_his_ pocketbook, which he had
                    asked her to take care of. How could she face him! What would he think of her,
                    so untrustworthy! What a return for his kindness! She felt weak&mdash;so
                    weak that she lay down. The food she had taken turned to poison and her head
                    ached fiercely. What could she do? To speak to the proprietor would be to cause
                    a great commotion, to attract attention to herself&mdash;and how would that
                    help to bring back the stolen pocketbook, taken perhaps by the proprietor
                    himself? She recalled that as she hurried through the office from the
                    dining-room he had a queer shifting expression, gave her a wheedling, cringing
                    good morning not at all in keeping with the character he had shown the night
                    before. The slovenly girl came to do the room; Susan sent her away, sat by the
                    window gazing out over the river and downstream. He would soon be here; the
                    thought made her long to fly and hide. He had been all generosity; and this was
                    her way of appreciating it! </p>
                <p>They sent for her to come down to supper. She refused, saying she was not feeling
                    well. She searched the room, the bag, again and again. She would rest a few
                    minutes, then up she would spring and tear everything out. Then back to the
                    window to sit and stare at the river over which the evening shadows were
                    beginning to gather. Once, as she was sitting there, she happened to see the
                    gaudily painted and decorated show boat. A man&mdash;the stranger of the
                    dinner table&mdash;was standing on the forward end, smoking a cigar. She saw
                    that he was observing her, realized he could have seen her stirring feverishly
                    about her room. A woman came out of the cabin and joined him. As <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0224" n="201"/> soon as his attention was distracted
                    she closed her shutters. And there she sat alone, with the hours dragging their
                    wretched minutes slowly away. </p>
                <p>That was one of those nights upon which anyone who has had them&mdash;and who
                    has not?&mdash;looks back with wonder at how they ever lived, how they ever
                    came to an end. She slept a little toward dawn&mdash;for youth and health
                    will not let the most despairing heart suffer in sleeplessness. Her headache
                    went, but the misery of soul which had been a maddening pain settled down into a
                    throbbing ache. She feared he would come; she feared he would not come. The
                    servants tried to persuade her to take breakfast. She could not have swallowed
                    food; she would not have dared take food for which she could not pay. What would
                    they do with her if he did not come? She searched the room again, hoping against
                    hope, a hundred times fancying she felt the purse under some other things, each
                    time suffering sickening disappointment. </p>
                <p>Toward noon the servant came knocking. "A letter for you, ma'am." </p>
                <p>Susan rushed to the door, seized the letter, tore it open, read: </p>
                <p> When I got back to the horse and started to mount, he kicked me and broke my
                    leg. You can go on south to the L. and N. and take a train to Cincinnati. When
                    you find a boarding house send your address to me at the office. I'll come in a
                    few weeks. I'd write more but I can't. Don't worry. Everything'll come out
                    right. You are brave and sensible, and I _back you to win_. </p>
                <p> With the unsigned letter crumpled in her hands she sat at the window with
                    scarcely a motion until noon. She then went down to the show boat. Several
                    people <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0225" n="202"/> &mdash;men and
                    women&mdash;were on the forward end, quarreling. She looked only at her
                    acquaintance. His face was swollen and his eyes bloodshot, but he still wore the
                    air of easy and patient good-humor. She said, standing on the shore, "Could I
                    speak to you a minute?" </p>
                <p>"Certainly, ma'am," replies he, lifting his dingy straw hat with gaudy, stained
                    band. He came down the broad plank to the shore. "Why, what's the matter?" This
                    in a sympathetic tone. </p>
                <p>"Will you lend me two dollars and take me along to work it out?" she asked. </p>
                <p>He eyed her keenly. "For the hotel bill?" he inquired, the cigar tucked away in
                    the corner of his mouth. </p>
                <p>She nodded. </p>
                <p>"He didn't show up?" </p>
                <p>"He broke his leg." </p>
                <p>"Oh!" The tone was politely sympathetic, but incredulous. He eyed her critically,
                    thoughtfully. "Can you sing?" he finally asked. </p>
                <p>"A little." </p>
                <p>His hands were deep in the pockets of his baggy light trousers. He drew one of
                    them out with a two-dollar bill in it. "Go and pay him and bring your things.
                    We're about to push off." </p>
                <p>"Thank you," said the girl in the same stolid way. She returned to the hotel,
                    brought the bag down from her room, stood at the office desk. </p>
                <p>The servant came. "Mr. Gumpus has jes' stepped out," said she. </p>
                <p>"Here is the money for my room." And Susan laid the two-dollar bill on the
                    register. </p>
                <p>"Ain't you goin' to wait fur yer&mdash;yer brother?" </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0226" n="203"/>
                <p>"He's not coming," replied the girl. "So&mdash;I'll go. Good-by." </p>
                <p>"Good-by. It's awful, bein' took sick away from home." </p>
                <p>"Thank you," said Susan. "Good-by." </p>
                <p>The girl's homely, ignorant face twisted in a grin. But Susan did not see, would
                    have been indifferent had she seen. Since she accepted the war earth and heaven
                    had declared against her, she had ceased from the little thought she had once
                    given to what was thought of her by those of whom she thought not at all. She
                    went down to the show boat. The plank had been taken in. Her acquaintance was
                    waiting for her, helped her to the deck, jumped aboard himself, and was
                    instantly busy helping to guide the boat out into mid-stream. Susan looked back
                    at the hotel. Mr. Gumpus was in the doorway, amusement in every line of his ugly
                    face. Beside him stood the slovenly servant. She was crying&mdash;the more
                    human second thought of a heart not altogether corrupted by the sordid hardness
                    of her lot. How can faith in the human race falter when one considers how much
                    heart it has in spite of all it suffers in the struggle upward through the dense
                    fogs of ignorance upward, toward the truth, toward the light of which it never
                    ceases to dream and to hope? </p>
                <p> Susan stood in the same place, with her bag beside her, until her acquaintance
                    came. </p>
                <p>"Now," said he, comfortably, as he lighted a fresh cigar, "we'll float pleasantly
                    along. I guess you and I had better get acquainted. What is your name?" </p>
                <p>Susan flushed. "Kate Peters is the name I gave at the hotel. That'll do, won't
                    it?" </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0227" n="204"/>
                <p>"Never in the world!" replied he. "You must have a good catchy name.
                    Say&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;" He rolled his cigar slowly, looking
                    thoughtfully toward the willows thick and green along the Indiana shore.
                    "Say&mdash;well, say&mdash;Lorna&mdash;Lorna&mdash;Lorna
                    Sackville! That's a winner. Lorna Sackville!&mdash;A stroke of genius! Don't
                    you think so?" </p>
                <p>"Yes," said Susan. "It doesn't matter." </p>
                <p>"But it does," remonstrated he. "You are an artist, now, and an artist's name
                    should always arouse pleasing and romantic anticipations. It's like the odor
                    that heralds the dish. You must remember, my dear, that you have stepped out of
                    the world of dull reality into the world of ideals, of dreams." </p>
                <p>The sound of two harsh voices, one male, the other female, came from within the
                    cabin&mdash;oaths, reproaches. Her acquaintance laughed. "That's one on
                    me&mdash;eh? Still, what I say is true&mdash;or at least ought to be. By
                    the way, this is the Burlingham Floating Palace of Thespians, floating temple to
                    the histrionic art. I am Burlingham&mdash;Robert Burlingham." He smiled,
                    extended his hand. "Glad to meet you, Miss Lorna Sackville&mdash;don't
                    forget!" </p>
                <p>She could not but reflect a smile so genuine, so good-humored. </p>
                <p>"We'll go in and meet the others&mdash;your fellow stars&mdash;for this
                    is an all-star aggregation." </p>
                <p>Over the broad entrance to the cabin was a chintz curtain strung upon a wire.
                    Burlingham drew this aside. Susan was looking into a room about thirty feet
                    long, about twelve feet wide, and a scant six feet high. Across it with an aisle
                    between were narrow wooden benches with backs. At the opposite end was a stage,
                    with the curtain up and a portable stove occupying <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0228" n="205"/> the center. At the stove a woman in a
                    chemise and underskirt, with slippers on her bare feet, was toiling over several
                    pots and pans with fork and spoon. At the edge of the stage, with legs swinging,
                    sat another woman, in a blue sailor suit neither fresh nor notably clean but
                    somehow coquettish. Two men in flannel shirts were seated, one on each of the
                    front benches, with their backs to her. </p>
                <p>As Burlingham went down the aisle ahead of her, he called out: "Ladies and
                    gentlemen, I wish to present the latest valuable addition to our
                    company&mdash;Miss Lorna Sackville, the renowned ballad singer." </p>
                <p>The two men turned lazily and stared at Susan, each with an arm hanging over the
                    back of the bench. </p>
                <p>Burlingham looked at the woman bent over the stove&mdash;a fat, middle-aged
                    woman with thin, taffy-yellow hair done sleekly over a big rat in front and made
                    into a huge coil behind with the aid of one or more false braids. She had a fat
                    face, a broad expanse of unpleasant-looking, elderly bosom, big, shapeless white
                    arms. Her contour was almost gone. Her teeth were a curious mixture of natural,
                    gold, and porcelain. "Miss Anstruther&mdash;Miss Sackville," called
                    Burlingham. "Miss Sackville, Miss Violet Anstruther." </p>
                <p>Miss Anstruther and Susan exchanged bows&mdash;Susan's timid and frightened,
                    Miss Anstruther's accompanied by a hostile stare and a hardening of the fat,
                    decaying face. </p>
                <p>"Miss Connemora&mdash;Miss Sackville." Burlingham was looking at the younger
                    woman&mdash;she who sat on the edge of the little stage. She, too, was a
                    blond, but her hair had taken to the chemical somewhat less reluctantly than had
                    Miss Anstruther's, with the result that Miss Connemora's looked golden. Her
                    face&mdash; <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0229" n="106"/> of the baby type must
                    have been softly pretty at one time&mdash;not so very distant. Now lines
                    were coming and the hard look that is inevitable with dyed hair. Also her once
                    fine teeth were rapidly going off, as half a dozen gold fillings in front
                    proclaimed. At Susan's appealing look and smile Miss Connemora nodded not
                    unfriendly. </p>
                <p>"Good God, Bob," said she to Burlingham with a laugh, "are you going to get the
                    bunch of us pinched for child-stealing?" </p>
                <p>Burlingham started to laugh, suddenly checked himself, looked uneasily and keenly
                    at Susan. "Oh, it's all right," he said with a wave of the hand. But his tone
                    belied his words. He puffed twice at his cigar, then introduced the
                    men&mdash;Elbert Eshwell and Gregory Tempest&mdash;two of the kind
                    clearly if inelegantly placed by the phrase, "greasy hamfats." Mr. Eshwell's
                    blackdyed hair was smoothly brushed down from a central part, Mr. Tempest's
                    iron-gray hair was greasily wild&mdash;a disarray of romantic ringlets.
                    Eshwell was inclined to fat; Tempest was gaunt and had the hollow, burning eye
                    that bespeaks the sentimental ass. </p>
                <p>"Now, Miss Sackville," said Burlingham, "we'll go on the forward deck and canvass
                    the situation. What for dinner, Vi?" </p>
                <p>"Same old rot," retorted Miss Anstruther, wiping the sweat from her face and
                    shoulders with a towel that served also as a dishcloth. "Pork and
                    beans&mdash;potatoes&mdash;peach pie." </p>
                <p>"Cheer up," said Burlingham. "After tomorrow we'll do better." </p>
                <p>"That's been the cry ever since we started," snapped Violet. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0230"/>

                <p>"For God's sake, shut up, Vi," groaned Eshwell. "You're always kicking." </p>
                <p>The cabin was not quite the full width of the broad house boat. Along the
                    outside, between each wall and the edge, there was room for one person to pass
                    from forward deck to rear. From the cabin roof, over the rear deck, into the
                    water extended a big rudder oar. When Susan, following Burlingham, reached the
                    rear deck, she saw the man at this oar&mdash;a fat, amiable-looking rascal,
                    in linsey woolsey and a blue checked shirt open over his chest and revealing a
                    mat of curly gray hair. Burlingham hailed him as Pat&mdash;his only known
                    name. But Susan had only a glance for him and no ear at all for the chaffing
                    between him and the actor-manager. She was gazing at the Indiana shore, at a
                    tiny village snuggled among trees and ripened fields close to the water's edge.
                    She knew it was Brooksburg. She remembered the long covered bridge which they
                    had crossed&mdash;Spenser and she, on the horse. To the north of the town,
                    on a knoll, stood a large red brick house trimmed with white veranda and
                    balconies&mdash;far and away the most pretentious house in the landscape.
                    Before the door was a horse and buggy. She could make out that there were
                    several people on the front veranda, one of them a man in black&mdash;the
                    doctor, no doubt. Sobs choked up into her throat. She turned quickly away that
                    Burlingham might not see. And under her breath she said, </p>
                <p>"Good-by, dear. Forgive me&mdash;forgive me." </p>

                <head> XIII</head>
                <p> WOMAN'S worktable, a rocking chair and another with a swayback that made it
                    fairly comfortable for lounging gave the rear deck the air of an outdoor
                    sitting-room, which indeed it was. Burlingham, after a comprehensive glance at
                    the panorama of summer and fruitfulness through which they were drifting,
                    sprawled himself in the swayback chair, indicating to Susan that she was to face
                    him in the rocker. "Sit down, my dear," said he. "And tell me you are at least
                    eighteen and are not running away from home. You heard what Miss Connemora
                    said." </p>
                <p>"I'm not running away from home," replied Susan, blushing violently because she
                    was evading as to the more important fact. </p>
                <p>"I don't know anything about you, and I don't want to know," pursued Burlingham,
                    alarmed by the evidences of a dangerous tendency to candor. "I've no desire to
                    have my own past dug into, and turn about's fair play. You came to me to get an
                    engagement. I took you. Understand?" </p>
                <p>Susan nodded. </p>
                <p>"You said you could sing&mdash;that is, a little." </p>
                <p>"A very little," said the girl. </p>
                <p>"Enough, no doubt. That has been our weak point&mdash;lack of a ballad
                    singer. Know any ballads?&mdash;Not fancy ones. Nothing fancy! We cater to
                    the plain people, and the plain people only like the best&mdash;that is, the
                    simplest&mdash;the things that reach for the <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0232" n="209"/>heartstrings with ten strong
                    fingers. You don't happen to know `I Stood on the Bridge at Midnight'?" </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;Ruth sings that," replied Susan, and colored violently. </p>
                <p>Burlingham ignored the slip. "`Blue Alsatian Mountains'?" </p>
                <p>"Yes. But that's very old." </p>
                <p>"Exactly. Nothing is of any use to the stage until it's very old. Audiences at
                    theaters don't want to _hear_ anything they don't already know by heart. They've
                    come to _see_, not to hear. So it annoys them to have to try to hear. Do you
                    understand that?" </p>
                <p>"No," confessed Susan. "I'm sorry. But I'll think about it, and try to understand
                    it." She thought she was showing her inability to do what was expected of her in
                    paying back the two dollars. </p>
                <p>"Don't bother," said Burlingham. "Pat!" </p>
                <p>"Yes, boss," said the man at the oar, without looking or removing his pipe. </p>
                <p>"Get your fiddle." </p>
                <p>Pat tied the oar fast and went forward along the roof of the cabin. While he was
                    gone Burlingham explained, "A frightful souse, Pat&mdash;almost equal to
                    Eshwell and far the superior of Tempest or Vi&mdash;that is, of Tempest. But
                    he's steady enough for our purposes, as a rule. He's the pilot, the orchestra,
                    the man-of-all-work, the bill distributor. Oh, he's a wonder. Graduate of
                    Trinity College, Dublin&mdash;yeggman&mdash;panhandler&mdash;
                    barrel-house bum&mdash;genius, nearly. Has drunk as much booze as there is
                    water in this river&mdash;" </p>
                <p>Pat was back beside the handle of the oar, with a violin. Burlingham suggested to
                    Susan that she'd better stand while she sang, "and if you've any tendency <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0233" n="210"/> to stage fright, remember it's your
                    bread and butter to get through well. You'll not bother about your audience." </p>
                <p>Susan found this thought a potent strengthener&mdash;then and afterward. With
                    surprisingly little embarrassment she stood before her good-natured, sympathetic
                    employer, and while Pat scraped out an accompaniment sang the pathetic story of
                    the "maiden young and fair" and the "stranger in the spring" who "lingered near
                    the fountains just to hear the maiden sing," and how he departed after winning
                    her love, and how "she will never see the stranger where the fountains fall
                    again&mdash;ade, ade, ade." Her voice was deliciously young and had the
                    pathetic quality that is never absent from anything which has enduring charm for
                    us. Tears were in Burlingham's voice&mdash;tears for the fate of the maiden,
                    tears of response to the haunting pathos of Susan's sweet contralto, tears of
                    joy at the acquisition of such a "number" for his program. As her voice died
                    away he beat his plump hands together enthusiastically. </p>
                <p>"She'll do&mdash;eh, Pat? She'll set the hay-tossers crazy!" </p>
                <p>Susan's heart was beating fast from nervousness. She sat down. Burlingham sprang
                    up and put his hands on her shoulders and kissed her. He laughed at her
                    shrinking. </p>
                <p>"Don't mind, my dear," he cried. "It's one of our ways. Now, what others do you
                    know?" </p>
                <p>She tried to recall, and with his assistance finally did discover that she
                    possessed a repertoire of "good old stale ones," consisting of "Coming Thro' the
                    Rye," "Suwanee River," "Annie Laurie" and "Kathleen Mavourneen." She knew many
                    other songs, but either <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0234" n="211"/> Pat could not
                    play them or Burlingham declared them "above the head of Reub the rotter." </p>
                <p>"Those five are quite enough," said Burlingham. "Two regulars, two encores, with
                    a third in case of emergency. After dinner Miss Anstruther and I'll fit you out
                    with a costume. You'll make a hit at Sutherland tonight." </p>
                <p>"Sutherland!" exclaimed Susan, suddenly pale. "I can't sing
                    there&mdash;really, I can't." </p>
                <p>Burlingham made a significant gesture toward Pat at the oar above them, and
                    winked at her. "You'll not have stage fright, my dear. You'll pull through." </p>
                <p>Susan understood that nothing more was to be said before Pat. Soon Burlingham
                    told him to tie the oar again and retire to the cabin. "I'll stand watch," said
                    he. "I want to talk business with Miss Sackville." </p>
                <p>When Pat had gone, Burlingham gave her a sympathetic look. "No confidences, mind
                    you, my dear," he warned. "All I want to know is that it isn't stage fright
                    that's keeping you off the program at Sutherland." </p>
                <p>"No," replied the girl. "It isn't stage fright. I'm&mdash;I'm sorry I can't
                    begin right away to earn the money to pay you back. But&mdash;I can't." </p>
                <p>"Not even in a velvet and spangle costume&mdash;Low neck, short sleeves, with
                    blond wig and paint and powder? You'll not know yourself, my
                    dear&mdash;really." </p>
                <p>"I couldn't," said Susan. "I'd not be able to open my lips." </p>
                <p>"Very well. That's settled." It was evident that Burlingham was deeply
                    disappointed. "We were going to try to make a killing at Sutherland." He sighed.
                    "However, let that pass. If you can't, you can't." </p>
                <p>"I'm afraid you're angry with me," cried she. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0235" n="212"/>
                <p>"I&mdash;angry!" He laughed. "I've not been angry in ten years. I'm such a
                    _damn_, damn fool that with all the knocks life's given me I haven't learned
                    much. But at least I've learned not to get angry. No, I understand, my
                    dear&mdash;and will save you for the next town below." He leaned forward and
                    gave her hands a fatherly pat as they lay in her lap. "Don't give it a second
                    thought," he said. "We've got the whole length of the river before us." </p>
                <p>Susan showed her gratitude in her face better far than she could have expressed
                    it in words. The two sat silent. When she saw his eyes upon her with that look
                    of smiling wonder in them, she said, "You mustn't think I've done anything
                    dreadful. I haven't&mdash;really, I haven't." </p>
                <p>He laughed heartily. "And if you had, you'd not need to hang your head in this
                    company, my dear. We're all people who have _lived_&mdash;and life isn't
                    exactly a class meeting with the elders taking turns at praying and the organ
                    wheezing out gospel hymns. No, we've all been up against it most of our
                    lives&mdash;which means we've done the best we could oftener than we've had
                    the chance to do what we ought." He gave her one of his keen looks, nodded: "I
                    like you. . . . What do they tell oftenest when they're talking about how you
                    were as a baby?" </p>
                <p>Susan did not puzzle over the queerness of this abrupt question. She fell to
                    searching her memory diligently for an answer. "I'm not sure, but I think they
                    speak oftenest of how I never used to like anybody to take my hand and help me
                    along, even when I was barely able to walk. They say I always insisted on
                    trudging along by myself." </p>
                <p>Burlingham nodded, slapped his knee. "I can believe <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0236" n="213"/> it," he cried. "I always ask
                    everybody that question to see whether I've sited 'em up right. I rather think I
                    hit you off to a T&mdash;as you faced me at dinner yesterday in the hotel.
                    Speaking of dinner&mdash;let's go sit in on the one I smell." </p>
                <p>They returned to the cabin where, to make a table, a board had been swung between
                    the backs of the second and third benches from the front on the left side of the
                    aisle. Thus the three men sat on the front bench with their legs thrust through
                    between seat and back, while the three women sat in dignity and comfort on the
                    fourth bench. Susan thought the dinner by no means justified Miss Anstruther's
                    pessimism. It was good in itself, and the better for being in this
                    happy-go-lucky way, in this happy-go-lucky company. Once they got started, all
                    the grouchiness disappeared. Susan, young and optimistic and determined to be
                    pleased, soon became accustomed to the looks of her new
                    companions&mdash;that matter of mere exterior about which we shallow
                    surface-skimmers make such a mighty fuss, though in the test situations of life,
                    great and small, it amounts to precious little. They were all human beings, and
                    the girl was unspoiled, did not think of them as failures, half-wolves, of no
                    social position, of no standing in the respectable world. She still had much of
                    the natural democracy of children, and she admired these new friends who knew so
                    much more than she did, who had lived, had suffered, had come away from horrible
                    battles covered with wounds, the scars of which they would bear into the
                    grave&mdash;battles they had lost; yet they had not given up, but had lived
                    on, smiling, courageous, kind of heart. It was their kind hearts that most
                    impressed her&mdash;their kind taking in of her whom those she loved had
                    cast <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0237" n="214"/> out&mdash;her, the unknown
                    stranger, helpless and ignorant. And what Spenser had told her about the stage
                    and its people made her almost believe that they would not cast her out, though
                    they knew the dreadful truth about her birth. </p>
                <p>Tempest told a story that was "broad." While the others laughed, Susan gazed at
                    him with a puzzled expression. She wished to be polite, to please, to enjoy. But
                    what that story meant she could not fathom. Miss Anstruther jeered at her. "Look
                    at the innocent," she cried. </p>
                <p>"Shut up, Vi," retorted Miss Connemora. "It's no use for us to try to be anything
                    but what we are. Still, let the baby alone." </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;let her alone," said Burlingham. </p>
                <p>"It'll soak in soon enough," Miss Connemora went on. "No use rubbing it in." </p>
                <p>"What?" said Susan, thinking to show her desire to be friendly, to be one of
                    them. </p>
                <p>"Dirt," said Burlingham dryly. "And don't ask any more questions." </p>
                <p>When the three women had cleared away the dinner and had stowed the dishes in one
                    of the many cubbyholes along the sides of the cabin, the three men got ready for
                    a nap. Susan was delighted to see them drop to the tops of the backs of the
                    seats three berths which fitted snugly into the walls when not in use. She saw
                    now that there were five others of the same kind, and that there was a
                    contrivance of wires and curtains by which each berth could be shut off to
                    itself. She had a thrilling sense of being in a kind of Swiss Family Robinson
                    storybook come to life. She unpacked her bag, contributed the food in it to the
                    common store, spread out her serge suit which Miss Anstruther offered <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0238" n="215"/> to press and insisted on pressing,
                    though Susan protested she could do it herself quite well. </p>
                <p>"You'll want to put it on for the arrival at Sutherland," said Mabel Connemora. </p>
                <p>"No," replied Susan nervously. "Not till tomorrow." </p>
                <p>She saw the curious look in all their eyes at sight of that dress, so different
                    from the calico she was wearing. Mabel took her out on the forward deck where
                    there was an awning and a good breeze. They sat there, Mabel talking, Susan
                    gazing rapt at land and water and at the actress, and listening as to a fairy
                    story&mdash;for the actress had lived through many and strange experiences
                    in the ten years since she left her father's roof in Columbia, South Carolina.
                    Susan listened and absorbed as a dry sponge dropped into a pail of water. At her
                    leisure she would think it all out, would understand, would learn. </p>
                <p>"Now, tell _me_ about _your_self," said Mabel when she had exhausted all the
                    reminiscences she could recall at the moment&mdash;all that were fit for a
                    "baby's" ears. </p>
                <p>"I will, some time," said Susan, who was ready for the question. "But I
                    can't&mdash;not yet." </p>
                <p>"It seems to me you're very innocent," said Mabel, "even for a well-brought-up
                    girl. _I_ was well brought up, too. I wish to God my mother had told me a few
                    things. But no&mdash;not a thing." </p>
                <p>"What do you mean?" inquired Susan. </p>
                <p>That set the actress to probing the girl's innocence&mdash;what she knew and
                    what she did not. It had been many a day since Miss Connemora had had so much
                    pleasure. "Well!" she finally said. "I never would have believed
                    it&mdash;though I know these things are so. Now I'm going to teach you.
                    Innocence may be a <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0239" n="216"/> good thing for
                    respectable women who are going to marry and settle down with a good husband to
                    look after them. But it won't do at all&mdash;not at all, my
                    dear!&mdash;for a woman who works&mdash;who has to meet men in their own
                    world and on their own terms. It's hard enough to get along, if you know. If you
                    don't&mdash;when you're knocked down, you stay knocked down." </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;I want to learn," said Susan eagerly. "I want to
                    know&mdash;_everything!_" </p>
                <p>"You're not going back?" Mabel pointed toward the shore, to a home on a hillside,
                    with a woman sewing on the front steps and children racing about the yard. "Back
                    to that sort of thing?" </p>
                <p>"No," replied Susan. "I've got nothing to go back to." </p>
                <p>"Nonsense!" </p>
                <p>"Nothing," repeated Susan in the same simple, final way. "I'm an outcast." </p>
                <p>The ready tears sprang to Mabel's dissipated but still bright eyes. Susan's
                    unconscious pathos was so touching. "Then I'll educate you. Now don't get
                    horrified or scandalized at me. When you feel that way, remember that Mabel
                    Connemora didn't make the world, but God. At least, so they say&mdash;though
                    personally I feel as if the devil had charge of things, and the only god was in
                    us poor human creatures fighting to be decent. I tell you, men and women ain't
                    bad&mdash;not so damn bad&mdash;excuse me; they will slip out. No, it's
                    the things that happen to them or what they're afraid'll happen&mdash;it's
                    those things that compel them to be bad&mdash;and get them in the way of
                    being bad&mdash;hard to each other, and to hate and to lie and to do all
                    sorts of things." </p>
                <p>The show boat drifted placidly down with the current <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0240" n="217"/> of the broad Ohio. Now it moved
                    toward the left bank and now toward the right, as the current was deflected by
                    the bends&mdash;the beautiful curves that divided the river into a series of
                    lovely, lake-like reaches, each with its emerald oval of hills and rolling
                    valleys where harvests were ripening. And in the shadow of the awning Susan
                    heard from those pretty, coarse lips, in language softened indeed but still far
                    from refined, about all there is to know concerning the causes and consequences
                    of the eternal struggle that rages round sex. To make her tale vivid, Mabel
                    illustrated it by the story of her own life from girlhood to the present hour.
                    And she omitted no detail necessary to enforce the lesson in life. A few days
                    before Susan would not have believed, would not have understood. Now she both
                    believed and understood. And nothing that Mabel told her&mdash;not the worst
                    of the possibilities in the world in which she was adventuring&mdash;burned
                    deep enough to penetrate beyond the wound she had already received and to give
                    her a fresh sensation of pain and horror. </p>
                <p>"You don't seem to be horrified," said Mabel. </p>
                <p>Susan shook her head. "No," she said. "I feel&mdash;somehow I feel better." </p>
                <p>Mabel eyed her curiously&mdash;had a sense of a mystery of suffering which
                    she dared not try to explore. She said: "Better? That's queer. You don't take it
                    at all as I thought you would." </p>
                <p>Said Susan: "I had about made up my mind it was all bad. I see that maybe it
                    isn't." </p>
                <p>"Oh, the world isn't such a bad place&mdash;in lots of ways. You'll get a
                    heap of fun out of it if you don't take things or yourself seriously. I wish to
                    God I'd had somebody to tell me, instead of having to spell it <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0241" n="218"/> out, a letter at a time. I've got
                    just two pieces of advice to give you." And she stopped speaking and gazed away
                    toward the shore with a look that seemed to be piercing the hills. </p>
                <p>"Please do," urged Susan, when Mabel's long mood of abstraction tried her
                    patience. </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;yes&mdash;two pieces of advice. The first is, don't drink.
                    There's nothing to it&mdash;and it'll play hell&mdash;excuse
                    me&mdash;it'll spoil your looks and your health and give you a woozy head
                    when you most need a steady one. Don't drink&mdash;that's the first advice." </p>
                <p>"I won't," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"Oh, yes, you will. But remember my advice all the same. The second is, don't
                    sell your body to get a living, unless you've got to." </p>
                <p>"I couldn't do that," said the girl. </p>
                <p>Mabel laughed queerly. "Oh, yes, you could&mdash;and will. But remember my
                    advice. Don't sell your body because it seems to be the easy way to make a
                    living. I know most women get their living that way." </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;no&mdash;no, indeed!" protested Susan. </p>
                <p>"What a child you are!" laughed Mabel. "What's marriage but that?. . . Believe
                    your Aunt Betsy, it's the poorest way to make a living that ever was
                    invented&mdash;marriage or the other thing. Sometimes you'll be tempted to.
                    You're pretty, and you'll find yourself up against it with no way out. You'll
                    have to give in for a time, no doubt. The men run things in this world, and
                    they'll compel it&mdash;one way or another. But fight back to your feet
                    again. If I'd taken my own advice, my name would be on every dead wall in New
                    York in letters two feet high. Instead&mdash;" She laughed, without much
                    bitterness. "And why? All because I never learned to stand alone. I've even
                    supported men <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0242" n="219"/> &mdash;to have
                    something to lean on! How's that for a poor fool?" </p>
                <p>There Violet Anstruther called her. She rose. "You won't take my advice," she
                    said by way of conclusion. "Nobody'll take advice. Nobody can. We ain't made
                    that way. But don't forget what I've said. And when you've wobbled way off maybe
                    it'll give you something to steer back by." </p>
                <p>Susan sat on there, deep in the deepest of those brown studies that had been
                    characteristic of her from early childhood. Often&mdash;perhaps most
                    often&mdash;abstraction means only mental fogginess. But Susan happened to
                    be of those who can concentrate&mdash;can think things out. And that
                    afternoon, oblivious of the beauty around her, even unconscious of where she
                    was, she studied the world of reality&mdash;that world whose existence, even
                    the part of it lying within ourselves, we all try to ignore or to evade or to
                    deny, and get soundly punished for our folly. Taking advantage of the floods of
                    light Mabel Connemora had let in upon her&mdash;full light where there had
                    been a dimness that was equal to darkness&mdash;she drew from the closets of
                    memory and examined all the incidents of her life&mdash;all that were
                    typical or for other reasons important. One who comes for the first time into
                    new surroundings sees more, learns more about them in a brief period than has
                    been seen and known by those who have lived there always. After a few hours of
                    recalling and reconstructing Susan Lenox understood Sutherland probably better
                    than she would have understood it had she lived a long eventless life there. And
                    is not every Sutherland the world in miniature? </p>
                <p>She also understood her own position&mdash;why the world of respectability
                    had cast her out as soon as she <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0243" n="220"/>
                    emerged from childhood&mdash;why she could not have hoped for the lot to
                    which other girls looked forward&mdash;why she belonged with the outcasts,
                    in a world apart&mdash;and must live her life there. She felt that she could
                    not hope to be respected, loved, married. She must work out her destiny along
                    other lines. She understood it all, more clearly than would have been expected
                    of her. And it is important to note that she faced her future without repining
                    or self-pity, without either joy or despondency. She would go on; she would do
                    as best she could. And nothing that might befall could equal what she had
                    suffered in the throes of the casting out. </p>
                <p>Burlingham roused her from her long reverie. He evidently had come straight from
                    his nap&mdash;stocking feet, shirt open at the collar, trousers sagging and
                    face shiny with the sweat that accumulates during sleep on a hot day. "Round
                    that bend ahead of us is Sutherland," said he, pointing forward. </p>
                <p>Up she started in alarm. </p>
                <p>"Now, don't get fractious," cried he cheerfully. "We'll not touch shore for an
                    hour, at least. And nobody's allowed aboard. You can keep to the cabin. I'll see
                    that you're not bothered." </p>
                <p>"And&mdash;this evening?" </p>
                <p>"You can keep to the dressing-room until the show's over and the people've gone
                    ashore. And tomorrow morning, bright and early, we'll be off. I promised Pat a
                    day for a drunk at Sutherland. He'll have to postpone it. I'll give him three at
                    Jeffersonville, instead." </p>
                <p>Susan put on her sunbonnet as soon as the show boat rounded the bend above town.
                    Thus she felt safe in staying on deck and watching the town drift by. She did
                    not begin to think of going into the cabin until <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0244" n="221"/> Pat was working the boat in toward
                    the landing a square above the old familiar wharf-boat. "What day is this?" she
                    asked Eshwell. </p>
                <p>"Saturday." </p>
                <p>Only Saturday! And last Monday&mdash;less than five days ago&mdash;she
                    had left this town for her Cincinnati adventure. She felt as if months, years,
                    had passed. The town seemed strange to her, and she recalled the landmarks as if
                    she were revisiting in age the scenes of youth. How small the town seemed, after
                    Cincinnati! And how squat! Then&mdash; </p>
                <p>She saw the cupola of the schoolhouse. Its rooms, the playgrounds flashed before
                    her mind's eye&mdash;the teachers she had liked&mdash;those she had
                    feared&mdash;the face of her uncle, so kind and loving&mdash;that same
                    face, with hate and contempt in it&mdash; </p>
                <p>She hurried into the cabin, tears blinding her eyes, her throat choked with sobs. </p>
                <p> The Burlingham Floating Palace of Thespians tied up against the float of Bill
                    Phibbs's boathouse&mdash;a privilege for which Burlingham had to pay two
                    dollars. Pat went ashore with a sack of handbills to litter through the town.
                    Burlingham followed, to visit the offices of the two evening newspapers and by
                    "handing them out a line of smooth talk"&mdash;the one art whereof he was
                    master&mdash;to get free advertising. Also there were groceries to buy and
                    odds and ends of elastic, fancy crepe, paper muslin and the like for repairing
                    the shabby costumes. The others remained on board, Eshwell and Tempest to guard
                    the boat against the swarms of boys darting and swooping and chattering like a
                    huge flock of impudent English sparrows. An additional&mdash;and the
                    chief&mdash;reason for Burlingham's keeping <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0245"
                        n="222"/> the two actors close was that Eshwell was a drunkard and Tempest a
                    gambler. Neither could be trusted where there was the least temptation. Each
                    despised the other's vice and despised the other for being slave to it.
                    Burlingham could trust Eshwell to watch Tempest, could trust Tempest to watch
                    Eshwell. </p>
                <p>Susan helped Mabel with the small and early supper&mdash;cold chicken and
                    ham, fried potatoes and coffee. Afterward all dressed in the cabin. Some of the
                    curtains for dividing off the berths were drawn, out of respect to Susan not yet
                    broken to the ways of a mode of life which made privacy and personal modesty
                    impossible&mdash;and when any human custom becomes impossible, it does not
                    take human beings long to discover that it is also foolish and useless. The
                    women had to provide for a change of costumes. As the dressing-room behind the
                    stage was only a narrow space between the back drop and the forward wall of the
                    cabin, dressing in it was impossible, so Mabel and Vi put on a costume of
                    tights, and over it a dress. Susan was invited to remain and help. The making-up
                    of the faces interested her; she was amazed by the transformation of Mabel into
                    youthful loveliness, with a dairy maid's bloom in place of her pallid pastiness.
                    On the other hand, make-up seemed to bring out the horrors of Miss Anstruther's
                    big, fat, yet hollow face, and to create other and worse horrors&mdash;as if
                    in covering her face it somehow uncovered her soul. When the two women stripped
                    and got into their tights, Susan with polite modesty turned away. However,
                    catching sight of Miss Anstruther in the mirror that had been hung up under one
                    of the side lamps, she was so fascinated that she gazed furtively at her by that
                    indirect way. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0246" n="223"/>

                <p>Violet happened to see, laughed. "Look at the baby's shocked face, Mabel," she
                    cried. </p>
                <p>But she was mistaken. It was sheer horror that held Susan's gaze upon Violet's
                    incredible hips and thighs, violently obtruded by the close-reefed corset. Mabel
                    had a slender figure, the waist too short and the legs too nearly of the same
                    girth from hip to ankle, but for all that, attractive. Susan had never before
                    seen a woman in tights without any sort of skirt. </p>
                <p>"You would show up well in those things," Violet said to her, "that is, for a
                    thin woman. The men don't care much for thinness." </p>
                <p>"Not the clodhoppers and roustabouts that come to see us," retorted Mabel. "The
                    more a woman looks like a cow or a sow, the better they like it. They don't
                    believe it's female unless it looks like what they're used to in the barnyard
                    and the cattle pen." </p>
                <p>Miss Anstruther was not in the least offended. She paraded, jauntily switching
                    her great hips and laughing. "Jealous!" she teased. "You poor little
                    broomstick." </p>
                <p>Burlingham was in a white flannel suit that looked well enough in those dim
                    lights. The make-up gave him an air of rakish youth. Eshwell had got himself
                    into an ordinary sack suit. Tempest was in the tattered and dirty finery of a
                    seventeenth-century courtier. The paint and black made Eshwell's face fat and
                    comic; it gave Tempest distinction, made his hollow blazing eyes brilliant and
                    large. All traces of habitation were effaced from the "auditorium"; the lamps
                    were lighted, a ticket box was set up on the rear deck and an iron bar was
                    thrown half across the rear entrance to the cabin, that only one person at a
                    time might be able to pass. The curtain was let down&mdash;a <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0247" n="224"/> gaudy smear of a garden scene in a
                    French palace in the eighteenth century. Pat, the orchestra, put on a dress coat
                    and vest and a "dickey"; the coat had white celluloid cuffs pinned in the
                    sleeves at the wrists. </p>
                <p>As it was still fully an hour and a half from dark, Susan hid on the stage; when
                    it should be time for the curtain to go up she would retreat to the
                    dressing-room. Through a peephole in the curtain she admired the auditorium; and
                    it did look surprisingly well by lamplight, with the smutches and faded spots on
                    its bright paint softened or concealed. "How many will it hold?" she asked
                    Mabel, who was walking up and down, carrying her long train. </p>
                <p>"A hundred and twenty comfortably," replied Miss Connemora. "A hundred and fifty
                    crowded. It has held as high as thirty dollars, but we'll be lucky if we get
                    fifteen tonight." </p>
                <p>Susan glanced round at her. She was smoking a cigarette, handling it like a man.
                    Susan's expression was so curious that Mabel laughed. Susan, distressed, cried:
                    "I'm sorry if&mdash;if I was impolite." </p>
                <p>"Oh, you couldn't be impolite," said Mabel. "You've got that to learn,
                    too&mdash;and mighty important it is. We all smoke. Why not? We got out of
                    cigarettes, but Bob bought a stock this afternoon." </p>
                <p>Susan turned to the peephole. Pat, ready to take tickets, was "barking"
                    vigorously in the direction of shore, addressing a crowd which Susan of course
                    could not see. Whenever he paused for breath, Burlingham leaned from the box and
                    took it up, pouring out a stream of eulogies of his show in that easy, lightly
                    cynical voice of his. And the audience straggled in&mdash;young fellows and
                    their girls, roughs from along the river front, farmers in town for a day's
                    sport. Susan <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0248" n="225"/> did not see a single
                    familiar face, and she had supposed she knew, by sight at least, everyone in
                    Sutherland. From fear lest she should see someone she knew, her mind changed to
                    longing. At last she was rewarded. Down the aisle swaggered Redney King, son of
                    the washerwoman, a big hulking bully who used to tease her by pulling her hair
                    during recess and by kicking at her shins when they happened to be next each
                    other in the class standing in long line against the wall of the schoolroom for
                    recitation. From her security she smiled at Redney as representative of all she
                    loved in the old town. </p>
                <p>And now the four members of the company on the stage and in the dressing-room
                    lost their ease and contemptuous indifference. They had been talking sneeringly
                    about "yokels" and "jays" and "slum bums." They dropped all that, as there
                    spread over them the mysterious spell of the crowd. As individuals the
                    provincials in those seats were ridiculous; as a mass they were an audience, an
                    object of fear and awe. Mabel was almost in tears; Violet talked rapidly, with
                    excited gestures and nervous adjustments of various parts of her toilet. The two
                    men paced about, Eshwell trembling, Tempest with sheer fright in his rolling
                    eyes. </p>
                <p>They wet their dry lips with dry tongues. Each again and again asked the other
                    anxiously how he was looking and paced away without waiting for the answer. The
                    suspense and nervous terror took hold of Susan; she stood in the corner of the
                    dressing-room, pressing herself close against the wall, her fingers tightly
                    interlocked and hot and cold tremors chasing up and down her body. </p>
                <p>Burlingham left the box and combined Pat's duties with his own&mdash;a small
                    matter, as the audience was <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0249" n="226"/> seated
                    and a guard at the door was necessary only to keep the loafers on shore from
                    rushing in free. Pat advanced to the little space reserved before the stage, sat
                    down and fell to tuning his violin with all the noise he could make, to create
                    the illusion of a full orchestra. Miss Anstruther appeared in one of the forward
                    side doors of the auditorium, very dignified in her black satin (paper muslin)
                    dress, with many and sparkling hair and neck ornaments and rings that seemed
                    alight. She bowed to the audience, pulled a little old cottage organ from under
                    the stage and seated herself at it. </p>
                <p>After the overture, a pause. Susan, peeping through a hole in the drop, saw the
                    curtain go up, drew a long breath of terror as the audience was revealed beyond
                    the row of footlights, beyond the big, befrizzled blond head of Violet and the
                    drink-seared face of Pat. From the rear of the auditorium came Burlingham's
                    smooth-flowing, faintly amused voice, announcing the beginning of the
                    performance "a delightful feast throughout, ladies and gentlemen, amusing yet
                    elevating, ever moral yet with none of the depressing sadness of puritanism.
                    For, ladies and gentlemen, while we are pious, we are not puritan. The first
                    number is a monologue, `The Mad Prince,' by that eminent artist, Gregory
                    Tempest. He has delivered it before vast audiences amid thunders of applause." </p>
                <p>Susan thrilled as Tempest strode forth&mdash;Tempest transformed by the
                    footlights and by her young imagination into a true king most wonderfully and
                    romantically bereft of reason by the woes that had assailed him in horrid
                    phalanxes. If anyone had pointed out to her that Tempest's awful voice was
                    simply cheap ranting, or that her own woes had been as terrible as any that had
                    ever visited a king, or that when people go mad <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0250"
                        n="227"/> it is never from grief but from insides unromantically addled by
                    foolish eating and drinking&mdash;if anyone had attempted then and there to
                    educate the girl, how angry it would have made her, how she would have hated
                    that well-meaning person for spoiling her illusion! </p>
                <p>The spell of the stage seized her with Tempest's first line, first elegant
                    despairing gesture. It held her through Burlingham and Anstruther's "sketch" of
                    a matrimonial quarrel, through Connemora and Eshwell's "delicious symphonic
                    romanticism" of a lovers' quarrel and making up, through Tempest's recitation of
                    "Lasca," dying to shield her cowboy lover from the hoofs of the stampeded herd.
                    How the tears did stream from Susan's eyes, as Tempest wailed out those last
                    lines: </p>
                <p> But I wonder why I do not care for the things that are like the things that
                    were? </p>
                <p>Can it be that half my heart lies buried there, in Texas down by the Rio Grande? </p>
                <p> She saw the little grave in the desert and the vast blue sky and the buzzard
                    sailing lazily to and fro, and it seemed to her that Tempest himself had
                    inspired such a love, had lost a sweetheart in just that way. No wonder he
                    looked gaunt and hollow-eyed and sallow. The last part of the performance was
                    Holy Land and comic pictures thrown from the rear on a sheet substituted for the
                    drop. As Burlingham had to work the magic lantern from the dressing-room (while
                    Tempest, in a kind of monk's robe, used his voice and elocutionary powers in
                    describing the pictures, now lugubriously and now in "lighter vein"), Susan was
                    forced to retreat to the forward deck and missed that part of the show. But she
                    watched Burlingham shifting <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0251" n="228"/> the
                    slides and altering the forms of the lenses, and was in another way as much
                    thrilled and spellbound as by the acting. </p>
                <p>Nor did the spell vanish when, with the audience gone, they all sat down to a
                    late supper, and made coarse jests and mocked at their own doings and at the
                    people who had applauded. Susan did not hear. She felt proud that she was
                    permitted in so distinguished a company. Every disagreeable impression vanished.
                    How could she have thought these geniuses common and cheap! How had she dared
                    apply to them the standards of the people, the dull, commonplace people, among
                    whom she had been brought up! If she could only qualify for membership in this
                    galaxy! The thought made her feel like a worm aspiring to be a star. Tempest,
                    whom she had liked least, now filled her with admiration. She saw the tragedy of
                    his life plain and sad upon his features. She could not look at him without her
                    heart's contracting in an ache. </p>
                <p>It was not long before Mr. Tempest, who believed himself a lady-killer, noted the
                    ingenuous look in the young girl's face, and began to pose. And it was hardly
                    three bites of a ham sandwich thereafter when Mabel Connemora noted Tempest's
                    shootings of his cuffs and rumplings of his oily ringlets and rollings of his
                    hollow eyes. And at the sight Miss Mabel's bright eyes became bad and her tongue
                    shot satire at him. But Susan did not observe this. </p>
                <p>After supper they went straightway to bed. Burlingham drew the curtains round the
                    berth let down for Susan. The others indulged in no such prudery on so hot a
                    night. They put out the lamps and got ready for bed and into it by the dim light
                    trickling in through the big rear doorway and the two small <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0252" n="229"/> side doorways forward. To help on the
                    circulation of air Pat raised the stage curtain and drop, and opened the little
                    door forward. Each sleeper had a small netting suspended over him from the
                    ceiling; without that netting the dense swarms of savage mosquitoes would have
                    made sleep impossible. As it was, the loud singing of these baffled thousands
                    kept Susan awake. </p>
                <p>After a while, to calm her brain, excited by the evenings thronging impressions
                    and by the new&mdash;or, rather, reviewed&mdash;ambitions born of them,
                    Susan rose and went softly out on deck, in her nightgown of calico slip. Because
                    of the breeze the mosquitoes did not trouble her there, and she stood a long
                    time watching the town's few faint lights&mdash;watching the stars, the
                    thronging stars of the Milky
                    Way&mdash;dreaming&mdash;dreaming&mdash;dreaming. Yesterday had
                    almost faded from her, for youth lives only in tomorrow&mdash;youth in
                    tomorrow, age in yesterday, and none of us in today which is all we really have.
                    And she, with her wonderful health of body meaning youth as long as it lasted,
                    she would certainly be young until she was very old&mdash;would keep her
                    youth&mdash;her dreams&mdash;her living always in tomorrow. She was
                    dreaming of her first real tomorrow, now. She would work hard at this wonderful
                    profession&mdash;_her_ profession!&mdash;would be humble and attentive;
                    and surely the day must come when she too would feel upon her heart the
                    intoxicating beat of those magic waves of applause! </p>
                <p>Susan, more excited than ever, slipped softly into the cabin and stole into her
                    curtained berth. Like the soughing of the storm above the whimper of the
                    tortured leaves the stentorian snorings of two of the sleepers resounded above
                    the noise of the mosquitoes. She had hardly extended herself in her close little
                    bed <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0253" n="230"/> when she heard a stealthy step,
                    saw one of her curtains drawn aside. </p>
                <p>"Who is it?" she whispered, unsuspiciously, for she could see only a vague form
                    darkening the space between the parted curtains. </p>
                <p>The answer came in a hoarse undertone: "Ye dainty little darling!" She sat up,
                    struck out madly, screamed at the top of her lungs. The curtains fell back into
                    place, the snoring stopped. Susan, all in a sweat and a shiver, lay quiet.
                    Hoarse whispering; then in Burlingham's voice stern and gruff&mdash;"Get
                    back to your bed and let her alone, you rolling-eyed&mdash;" The sentence
                    ended with as foul a spatter of filth as man can fling at man. Silence again,
                    and after a few minutes the two snores resumed their bass accompaniment to the
                    falsetto of the mosquito chorus. </p>
                <p>Susan got a little troubled sleep, was wide awake when Violet came saying, "If
                    you want to bathe, I'll bring you a bucket of water and you can put up your
                    berth and do it behind your curtains." </p>
                <p>Susan thanked her and got a most refreshing bath. When she looked out the men
                    were on deck, Violet was getting breakfast, and Connemora was combing her short,
                    thinning, yellow hair before a mirror hung up near one of the forward doors. In
                    the mirror Connemora saw her, smiled and nodded. </p>
                <p>"You can fix your hair here," said she. "I'm about done. You can use my brush." </p>
                <p>And when Susan was busy at the mirror, Mabel lounged on a seat near by smoking a
                    before-breakfast cigarette. "I wish to God I had your hair," said she. "I never
                    did have such a wonderful crop of grass on the knoll, and the way it up and
                    drops out in bunches every now and then sets me crazy. It won't be long <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0254" n="231"/> before I'll be down to Vi's three
                    hairs and a half. You haven't seen her without her wigs? Well, don't, if you
                    happen to be feeling a bit off. How Burlingham can&mdash;" There she
                    stopped, blew out a volume of smoke, grinned half amusedly, half in sympathy
                    with the innocence she was protecting&mdash;or, rather, was initiating by
                    cautious degrees. "Who was it raised the row last night?" she inquired. </p>
                <p>"I don't know," said Susan, her face hid by the mass of wavy hair she was
                    brushing forward from roots to ends. </p>
                <p>"You don't? I guess you've got a kind of idea, though." </p>
                <p>No answer from the girl. </p>
                <p>"Well, it doesn't matter. It isn't your fault." Mabel smoked reflectively. "I'm
                    not jealous of _him_&mdash;a woman never is. It's the idea of another
                    woman's getting away with her property, whether she wants it or
                    not&mdash;_that's_ what sets her mad-spot to humming. No, I don't give
                    a&mdash;a cigarette butt&mdash;for that greasy bum actor. But I've
                    always got to have somebody." She laughed. "The idea of his thinking _you'd_
                    have _him_! What peacocks men are!" </p>
                <p>Susan understood. The fact of this sort of thing was no longer a mystery to her.
                    But the why of the fact&mdash;that seemed more amazing than ever. Now that
                    she had discovered that her notion of love being incorporeal was as fanciful as
                    Santa Claus, she could not conceive why it should be at all. As she was bringing
                    round the braids for the new coiffure she had adopted she said to Mabel: </p>
                <p>"You&mdash;love him?" </p>
                <p>"I?" Mabel laughed immoderately. "You can have him, if you want him." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0255"/>

                <p>Susan shuddered. "Oh, no," she said. "I suppose he's very nice&mdash;and
                    really he's quite a wonderful actor. But I&mdash;I don't care for men." </p>
                <p>Mabel laughed again&mdash;curt, bitter. "Wait," she said. </p>
                <p>Susan shook her head, with youth's positiveness. </p>
                <p>"What's caring got to do with it?" pursued Mabel, ignoring the headshake. "I've
                    been about quite a bit, and I've yet to see anybody that really cared for
                    anybody else. We care for ourselves. But a man needs a woman, and a woman needs
                    a man. They call it loving. They might as well call eating loving. Ask Burly."

                <p> AT breakfast Tempest was precisely as usual, and so were the others. Nor was
                    there effort or any sort of pretense in this. We understand only that to which
                    we are accustomed; the man of peace is amazed by the veteran's nonchalance in
                    presence of danger and horror, of wound and death. To these river wanderers,
                    veterans in the unconventional life, where the unusual is the usual, the
                    unexpected the expected, whatever might happen was the matter of course, to be
                    dealt with and dismissed. Susan naturally took her cue from them. When Tempest
                    said something to her in the course of the careless conversation round the
                    breakfast table, she answered&mdash;and had no sense of constraint. Thus, an
                    incident that in other surroundings would have been in some way harmful through
                    receiving the exaggeration of undue emphasis, caused less stir than the five
                    huge and fiery mosquito bites Eshwell had got in the night. And Susan
                    unconsciously absorbed one of those lessons in the science and art of living
                    that have decisive weight in shaping our destinies. For intelligent living is in
                    large part learning to ignore the unprofitable that one may concentrate upon the
                    profitable. </p>
                <p>Burlingham announced that they would cast off and float down to Bethlehem. There
                    was a chorus of protests. "Why, we ought to stay here a week!" cried Miss
                    Anstruther. "We certainly caught on last night." </p>
                <p>"Didn't we take in seventeen dollars?" demanded <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0257" n="234"/>Eshwell. "We can't do better than
                    that anywhere." </p>
                <p>"Who's managing this show?" asked Burlingham in his suave but effective way. "I
                    think I know what I'm about." </p>
                <p>He met their grumblings with the utmost good-humor and remained inflexible. Susan
                    listened with eyes down and burning cheeks. She knew Burlingham was "leaving the
                    best cow unmilked," as Connemora put it, because he wished to protect her. She
                    told him so when they were alone on the forward deck a little later, as the boat
                    was floating round the bend below Sutherland. </p>
                <p>"Yes," he admitted. "I've great hopes from your ballads. I want to get you on."
                    He looked round casually, saw that no one was looking, drew a peculiarly folded
                    copy of the _Sutherland Courier_ from his pocket. "Besides"&mdash;said he,
                    holding out the paper&mdash;"read that." </p>
                <p>Susan read: </p>
                <p> George Warham, Esq., requests us to announce that he has increased the reward
                    for information as to the whereabouts of Mrs. Susan Ferguson, his young niece,
                    nee Susan Lenox, to one thousand dollars. There are grave fears that the
                    estimable and lovely young lady, who disappeared from her husband's farm the
                    night of her marriage, has, doubtless in a moment of insanity, ended her life.
                    We hope not. </p>
                <p> Susan lifted her gaze from this paragraph, after she had read it until the words
                    ran together in a blur. She found Burlingham looking at her. Said he: "As I told
                    you before, I don't want to know anything. But when I read that, it occurred to
                    me, if some of the others saw it they might think it was you&mdash;and <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0258" n="235"/> might do a dirty trick." He sighed,
                    with a cynical little smile. "I was tempted, myself. A thousand is quite a
                    bunch. You don't know&mdash;not yet&mdash;how a chance to make some
                    money&mdash;any old way&mdash;compels a man&mdash;or a
                    woman&mdash;when money's as scarce and as useful as it is in this world. As
                    you get along, you'll notice, my dear, that the people who get moral goose flesh
                    at the shady doings of others are always people who haven't ever really been up
                    against it. I don't know why I didn't&mdash;" He shrugged his shoulders.
                    "Now, my dear, you're in on the secret of why I haven't got up in the world." He
                    smiled cheerfully. "But I may yet. The game's far from over." </p>
                <p>She realized that he had indeed made an enormous sacrifice for her; for, though
                    very ignorant about money, a thousand dollars seemed a fortune. She had no
                    words; she looked away toward the emerald shore, and her eyes filled and her lip
                    quivered. How much goodness there was in the world&mdash;how much generosity
                    and affection! </p>
                <p>"I'm not sure," he went on, "that you oughtn't to go back. But it's your own
                    business. I've a kind of feeling you know what you're about." </p>
                <p>"No matter what happens to me," said she, "I'll never regret what I've done. I'd
                    kill myself before I'd spend another day with the man they made me marry." </p>
                <p>"Well&mdash;I'm not fond of dying," observed Burlingham, in the light, jovial
                    tone that would most quickly soothe her agitation, "but I think I'd take my
                    chances with the worms rather than with the dry rot of a backwoods farm. You may
                    not get your meals so regular out in the world, but you certainly do live.
                    Yes&mdash;that backwoods life, for anybody with a spark of spunk, is simply
                    being dead and knowing it." He <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0259" n="236"/> tore
                    the _Courier_ into six pieces, flung them over the side. "None of the others saw
                    the paper," said he. "So&mdash;Miss Lorna Sackville is perfectly safe." He
                    patted her on the shoulder. "And she owes me a thousand and two dollars." </p>
                <p>"I'll pay&mdash;if you'll be patient," said the girl, taking his jest
                    gravely. </p>
                <p>"It's a good gamble," said he. Then he laughed. "I guess that had something to do
                    with my virtue. There's always a practical reason&mdash;always." </p>
                <p>But the girl was not hearing his philosophies. Once more she was overwhelmed and
                    stupefied by the events that had dashed in, upon, and over her like swift
                    succeeding billows that give the swimmer no pause for breath or for clearing the
                    eyes. </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;you're not dreaming," said Burlingham, laughing at her expression.
                    "At least, no more than we all are. Sometimes I suspect the whole damn
                    shooting-match is nothing but a dream. Well, it's a pretty good one eh?" </p>
                <p>And she agreed with him, as she thought how smoothly and agreeably they were
                    drifting into the unknown, full of the most fascinating possibilities. How
                    attractive this life was, how much at home she felt among these people, and if
                    anyone should tell him about her birth or about how she had been degraded by
                    Ferguson, it wouldn't in the least affect their feeling toward her, she was
                    sure. "When do&mdash;do you&mdash;try me?" she asked. </p>
                <p>"Tomorrow night, at Bethlehem&mdash;a bum little town for us. We'll stay
                    there a couple of days. I want you to get used to appearing." He nodded at her
                    encouragingly. "You've got stuff in you, real stuff. Don't you doubt it. Get
                    self-confidence&mdash;conceit, if you <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0260"
                        n="237"/> please. Nobody arrives anywhere without it. You want to feel that
                    you can do what you want to do. A fool's conceit is that he's it already. A
                    sensible man's conceit is that he can be it, if he'll only work hard and in the
                    right way. See?" </p>
                <p>"I&mdash;I think I do," said the girl. "I'm not sure." </p>
                <p>Burlingham smoked his cigar in silence. When he spoke, it was with eyes carefully
                    averted. "There's another subject the spirit moves me to talk to you about.
                    That's the one Miss Connemora opened up with you yesterday." As Susan moved
                    uneasily, "Now, don't get scared. I'm not letting the woman business bother me
                    much nowadays. All I think of is how to get on my feet again. I want to have a
                    theater on Broadway before the old black-flagger overtakes my craft and makes me
                    walk the plank and jump out into the Big Guess. So you needn't think I'm going
                    to worry you. I'm not." </p>
                <p>"Oh, I didn't think&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"You ought to have, though," interrupted he. "A man like me is a rare exception.
                    I'm a rare exception to my ordinary self, to be quite honest. It'll be best for
                    you always to assume that every man you run across is looking for just one
                    thing. You know what?" </p>
                <p>Susan, the flush gone from her cheeks, nodded. </p>
                <p>"I suppose Connemora has put you wise. But there are some things even she don't
                    know about that subject. Now, I want you to listen to your grandfather. Remember
                    what he says. And think it over until you understand it." </p>
                <p>"I will," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"In the life you've come out of, virtue in a woman's everything. She's got to be
                    virtuous, or at least to <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0261" n="238"/> have the
                    reputation of it&mdash;or she's nothing. You understand that?" </p>
                <p>"Yes," said Susan. "I understand that&mdash;now." </p>
                <p>"Very well. Now in the life you're going into, virtue in a woman is
                    nothing&mdash;no more than it is in a man anywhere. The woman who makes a
                    career becomes like the man who makes a career. How is it with a man? Some are
                    virtuous, others are not. But no man lets virtue bother him and nobody bothers
                    about his virtue. That's the way it is with a woman who cuts loose from the
                    conventional life of society and home and all that. She is virtuous or not, as
                    she happens to incline. Her real interest in herself, her real value, lies in
                    another direction. If it doesn't, if she continues to be agitated about her
                    virtue as if it were all there is to her&mdash;then the sooner she hikes
                    back to respectability, to the conventional routine, why the better for her.
                    She'll never make a career, any more than she could drive an automobile through
                    a crowded street and at the same time keep a big picture hat on straight. Do you
                    follow me?" </p>
                <p>"I'm not sure," said the girl. "I'll have to think about it." </p>
                <p>"That's right. Don't misunderstand. I'm not talking for or against virtue. I'm
                    simply talking practical life, and all I mean is that you won't get on there by
                    your virtue, and you won't get on by your lack of virtue. Now for my advice." </p>
                <p>Susan's look of unconscious admiration and attention was the subtlest flattery.
                    Its frank, ingenuous showing of her implicit trust in him so impressed him with
                    his responsibility that he hesitated before he said: </p>
                <p>"Never forget this, and don't stop thinking about it until you understand it:
                    Make men _as_ men incidental <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0262" n="239"/> in your
                    life, precisely as men who amount to anything make women _as_ women incidental." </p>
                <p>Her first sensation was obviously disappointing. She had expected something far
                    more impressive. Said she: </p>
                <p>"I don't care anything about men." </p>
                <p>"Be sensible! How are you to know now what you care about and what you don't?"
                    was Burlingham's laughing rebuke. "And in the line you've taken&mdash;the
                    stage&mdash;with your emotions always being stirred up, with your thoughts
                    always hovering round the relations of men and women&mdash;for that's the
                    only subject of plays and music, and with opportunity thrusting at you as it
                    never thrusts at conventional people you'll probably soon find you care a great
                    deal about men. But don't ever let your emotions hinder or hurt or destroy you.
                    Use them to help you. I guess I'm shooting pretty far over that young head of
                    yours, ain't I?" </p>
                <p>"Not so very far," said the girl. "Anyhow, I'll remember." </p>
                <p>"If you live big enough and long enough, you'll go through three stages. The
                    first is the one you're in now. They've always taught you without realizing it,
                    and so you think that only the strong can afford to do right. You think doing
                    right makes the ordinary person, like yourself, easy prey for those who do
                    wrong. You think that good people&mdash;if they're really
                    good&mdash;have to wait until they get to Heaven before they get a chance." </p>
                <p>"Isn't that so?" </p>
                <p>"No. But you'll not realize it until you pass into the second stage. There,
                    you'll think you see that only the strong can afford to do wrong. You'll think
                    that everyone, except the strong, gets it in the neck if he <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0263" n="240"/> or she does anything out of the way.
                    You'll think you're being punished for your sins, and that, if you had behaved
                    yourself, you'd have got on much better. That's the stage that's coming; and
                    what you go through with there&mdash;how you come out of the
                    fight&mdash;will decide your fate&mdash;show whether or not you've got
                    the real stuff in you. Do you understand?" </p>
                <p>Susan shook her head. </p>
                <p>"I thought not. You haven't lived long enough yet. Well, I'll finish, anyhow." </p>
                <p>"I'll remember," said Susan. "I'll think about it until I do understand." </p>
                <p>"I hope so. The weather and the scenery make me feel like philosophizing.
                    Finally, if you come through the second stage all right, you'll enter the third
                    stage. There, you'll see that you were right at first when you thought only the
                    strong could afford to do right. And you'll see that you were right in the
                    second stage when you thought only the strong could afford to do wrong. For
                    you'll have learned that only the strong can afford to act at all, and that they
                    can do right or wrong as they please _because they are strong_." </p>
                <p>"Then you don't believe in right, at all!" exclaimed the girl, much depressed,
                    but whether for the right or for her friend she could not have told. </p>
                <p>"Now, who said that?" Demanded he, amused. "What _did_ I say? Why&mdash;if
                    you want to do right, be strong or you'll be crushed; and if you want to do
                    wrong, take care again to be strong&mdash;or you'll be crushed. My moral is,
                    be strong! In this world the good weaklings and the bad weaklings had better lie
                    low, hide in the tall grass. The strong inherit the earth." </p>
                <p>They were silent a long time, she thinking, he observing her with sad tenderness.
                    At last he said: </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0264" n="241"/>

                <p>"You are a nice sweet girl&mdash;well brought up. But that means badly
                    brought up for the life you've got to lead&mdash;the life you've got to
                    learn to lead." </p>
                <p>"I'm beginning to see that," said the girl. Her gravity made him feel like
                    laughing, and brought the tears to his eyes. The laughter he suppressed. </p>
                <p>"You're going to fight your way up to what's called the triumphant
                    class&mdash;the people on top&mdash;they have all the success, all the
                    money, all the good times. Well, the things you've been taught&mdash;at
                    church&mdash;in the Sunday School&mdash;in the nice storybooks you've
                    read&mdash;those things are all for the triumphant class, or for people
                    working meekly along in `the station to which God has appointed them' and
                    handing over their earnings to their betters. But those nice moral things you
                    believe in&mdash;they don't apply to people like you&mdash;fighting
                    their way up from the meek working class to the triumphant class. You won't
                    believe me now&mdash;won't understand thoroughly. But soon you'll see. Once
                    you've climbed up among the successful people you can afford to
                    indulge&mdash;in moderation&mdash;in practicing the good old moralities.
                    Any dirty work you may need done you can hire done and pretend not to know about
                    it. But while you're climbing, no Golden Rule and no turning of the cheek. Tooth
                    and claw then&mdash;not sheathed but naked&mdash;not by proxy but in
                    your own person." </p>
                <p>"But you're not like that," said the girl. </p>
                <p>"The more fool I," repeated he. </p>
                <p>She was surprised that she understood so much of what he had
                    said&mdash;childlike wonder at her wise old heart, made wise almost in a
                    night&mdash;a wedding night. When Burlingham lapsed into silence, laughing
                    at himself for having talked so far over the "kiddie's" head, she sat puzzling
                    out what he had said. The world <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0265" n="242"/>
                    seemed horribly vast and forbidding, and the sky, so blue and bright, seemed
                    far, far away. She sighed profoundly. "I am so weak," she murmured. "I am so
                    ignorant." </p>
                <p>Burlingham nodded and winked. "Yes, but you'll grow," said be. "I back you to
                    win." </p>
                <p>The color poured into her cheeks, and she burst into tears. Burlingham thought he
                    understood; for once his shrewdness went far astray. Excusably, since he could
                    not know that he had used the same phrase that had closed Spenser's letter to
                    her. </p>
                <p> Late in the afternoon, when the heat had abated somewhat and they were floating
                    pleasantly along with the washing gently a-flutter from lines on the roof of the
                    auditorium, Burlingham put Eshwell at the rudder and with Pat and the violin
                    rehearsed her. "The main thing, the only thing to worry about," explained he,
                    "is beginning right." She was standing in the center of the stage, he on the
                    floor of the auditorium beside the seated orchestra. "That means," he went on,
                    "you've simply got to learn to come in right. We'll practice that for a while." </p>
                <p>She went to the wings&mdash;where there was barely space for her to conceal
                    herself by squeezing tightly against the wall. At the signal from him she walked
                    out. As she had the utmost confidence in his kindness, and as she was always too
                    deeply interested in what she and others were doing to be uncomfortably
                    self-conscious, she was not embarrassed, and thought she made the crossing and
                    took her stand very well. He nodded approvingly. "But," said he, "there's a
                    difference between a stage walk and walking anywhere else&mdash;or standing.
                    Nothing is natural on the stage. If it were <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0266"
                        n="243"/> it would look unnatural, because the stage itself is artificial
                    and whatever is there must be in harmony with it. So everything must be done
                    unnaturally in such a way that it _seems_ natural. Just as a picture boat looks
                    natural though it's painted on a flat surface. Now I'll illustrate." </p>
                <p>He gave her his hand to help her jump down; then he climbed to the stage. He went
                    to the wings and walked out. As he came he called her attention to how he poised
                    his body, how he advanced so that there would be from the auditorium no
                    unsightly view of crossing legs, how he arranged hands, arms, shoulders, legs,
                    head, feet for an attitude of complete rest. He repeated his illustration again
                    and again, Susan watching and listening with open-eyed wonder and admiration.
                    She had never dreamed that so simple a matter could be so complex. When he got
                    her up beside him and went through it with her, she soon became as used to the
                    new motions as a beginner at the piano to stretching an octave. But it was only
                    after more than an hour's practice that she moved him to say: </p>
                <p>"That'll do for a beginning. Now, we'll sing." </p>
                <p>She tried "Suwanee River" first and went through it fairly well, singing to him
                    as he stood back at the rear door. He was enthusiastic&mdash;cunning
                    Burlingham, who knew so well how to get the best out of everyone! "Mighty
                    good&mdash;eh, Pat? Yes, mighty good. You've got something better than a
                    great voice, my dear. You've got magnetism. The same thing that made me engage
                    you the minute you asked me is going to make you&mdash;well, go a long
                    ways&mdash;a _long_ ways. Now, we'll try `The Last Rose of Summer.'" </p>
                <p>She sang even better. And this improvement continued through the other four songs
                    of her repertoire. <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0267" n="244"/> His confidence in
                    her was contagious; it was so evident that he really did believe in her. And
                    Pat, too, wagged his head in a way that made her feel good about herself. Then
                    Burlingham called in the others whom he had sent to the forward deck. Before
                    them the girl went all to pieces. She made her entrance badly, she sang worse.
                    And the worse she sang, the worse she felt and the worse her next attempt was.
                    At last, with nerves unstrung, she broke down and sobbed. Burlingham climbed up
                    to pat her on the shoulder. </p>
                <p>"That's the best sign yet," said he. "It shows you've got temperament.
                    Yes&mdash;you've got the stuff in you." </p>
                <p>He quieted her, interested her in the purely mechanical part of what she was
                    doing. "Don't think of who you're doing it before, or of how you're doing it,
                    but only of getting through each step and each note. If your head's full of
                    that, you'll have no room for fright." And she was ready to try again. When she
                    finished the last notes of "Suwanee River," there was an outburst of hearty
                    applause. And the sound that pleased her most was Tempest's rich rhetorical
                    "Bravo!" As a man she abhorred him; but she respected the artist. And in
                    unconsciously drawing this distinction she gave proof of yet another quality
                    that was to count heavily in the coming days. Artist he was not. But she thought
                    him an artist. A girl or boy without the intelligence that can develop into
                    flower and fruit would have seen and felt only Tempest, the odious personality. </p>
                <p>Burlingham did not let her off until she was ready to drop with exhaustion. And
                    after supper, when they were floating slowly on, well out of the channel where
                    they might be run down by some passing steamer with a flint-hearted captain or
                    pilot, she had to go at it <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0268" n="245"/> again. She
                    went to bed early, and she slept without a motion or a break until the odor of
                    the cooking breakfast awakened her. When she came out, her face was bright for
                    the first time. She was smiling, laughing, chatting, was delighted with
                    everything and everybody. Even the thought of Roderick Spenser laid up with a
                    broken leg recurred less often and less vividly. It seemed to her that the leg
                    must be about well. The imagination of healthy youth is reluctant to admit ideas
                    of gloom in any circumstances. In circumstances of excitement and adventure,
                    such as Susan's at that time, it flatly refuses to admit them. </p>
                <p>They were at anchor before a little town sprawled upon the fields between hills
                    and river edge. A few loafers were chewing tobacco and inspecting the show boat
                    from the shady side of a pile of lumber. Pat had already gone forth with the
                    bundle of handbills; he was not only waking up the town, but touring the country
                    in horse and buggy, was agitating the farmers&mdash;for the show boat was to
                    stay at least two nights at Bethlehem. "And we ought to do pretty well," said
                    Burlingham. "The wheat's about all threshed, and there's a kind of lull. The
                    hayseeds aren't so dead tired at night. A couple of weeks ago we couldn't have
                    got half a house by paying for it." </p>
                <p>As the afternoon wore away and the sun disappeared behind the hills to the
                    southwest, Susan's spirits oozed. Burlingham and the
                    others&mdash;deliberately&mdash;paid no attention to her, acted as if no
                    great, universe-stirring event were impending. Immediately after supper
                    Burlingham said: </p>
                <p>"Now, Vi, get busy and put her into her harness. Make her a work of art." </p>
                <p>Never was there a finer display of unselfishness than <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0269" n="246"/> in their eagerness to help her
                    succeed, in their intense nervous anxiety lest she should not make a hit. The
                    bad in human nature, as Mabel Connemora had said, is indeed almost entirely if
                    not entirely the result of the compulsion of circumstances; the good is the
                    natural outcropping of normal instincts, and resumes control whenever
                    circumstances permit. These wandering players had suffered too much not to have
                    the keenest and gentlest sympathy. Susan looked on Tempest as a wicked man; yet
                    she could not but be touched by his almost hysterical excitement over her debut,
                    when the near approach of the hour made it impossible for his emotional
                    temperament longer to hide its agitation. Every one of them gave or loaned her a
                    talisman&mdash;Tempest, a bit of rabbit's foot; Anstruther, a ring that had
                    twice saved her from drowning (at least, it had been on her finger each time);
                    Connemora, a hunchback's tooth on a faded velvet string; Pat, a penny which
                    happened to be of the date of her birth year (the presence of the penny was
                    regarded by all as a most encouraging sign); Eshwell loaned her a miniature
                    silver bug he wore on his watch chain; Burlingham's contribution was a large
                    buckeye&mdash;"Ever since I've had that, I've never been without at least
                    the price of a meal in my pocket." </p>
                <p>They had got together for her a kind of evening dress, a pale blue chiffon-like
                    drapery that left her lovely arms and shoulders bare and clung softly to the
                    lines of her figure. They did her hair up in a graceful sweep from the brow and
                    a simple coil behind. She looked like a woman, yet like a child dressed as a
                    woman, too, for there was as always that exuberant vitality which made each of
                    the hairs of her head seem individual, electric. The rouge gave her color,
                    enhanced <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0270" n="247"/> into splendor the brilliance
                    of her violet-gray eyes&mdash;eyes so intensely colored and so admirably
                    framed that they were noted by the least observant. When Anstruther had put the
                    last touches to her toilet and paraded her to the others, there was a chorus of
                    enthusiasm. The men no less than the women viewed her with the professional eye. </p>
                <p>"Didn't I tell you all?" cried Burlingham, as they looked her up and down like a
                    group of connoisseurs inspecting a statue. "Wasn't I right?" </p>
                <p>"`It is the dawn, and Juliet is the east,'" orated Tempest in rich, romantic
                    tones. </p>
                <p>"A damn shame to waste her on these yaps," said Eshwell. </p>
                <p>Connemora embraced her with tearful eyes. "And as sweet as you are lovely, you
                    dear!" she cried. "You simply can't help winning." </p>
                <p>The two women thought her greatest charms were her form and her feet and ankles.
                    The men insisted that her charm of charms was her eyes. And certainly, much
                    could be said for that view. Susan's violet-gray eyes, growing grayer when she
                    was thoughtful, growing deeper and clearer and softer shining violet when her
                    emotions were touched&mdash;Susan's eyes were undoubtedly unusual even in a
                    race in which homely eyes are the exception. </p>
                <p>When it was her turn and she emerged into the glare of the footlights, she came
                    to a full stop and an awful wave of weakness leaped up through legs and body to
                    blind her eyes and crash upon her brain. She shook her head, lifted it high like
                    a swimmer shaking off a wave. Her gaze leaped in terror across the blackness of
                    the auditorium with its thick-strewn round white disks of human faces, sought
                    the eyes of Burlingham <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0271" n="248"/> standing in
                    full view in the center of the rear doorway&mdash;where he had told her to
                    look for him. She heard Pat playing the last of the opening chords; Burlingham
                    lifted his hand like a leader's baton. And naturally and sweetly the notes, the
                    words of the old darkey song of longing for home began to float out through the
                    stillness. </p>
                <p>She did not take her gaze from Burlingham. She sang her best, sang to please him,
                    to show him how she appreciated what he had done for her. And when she finished
                    and bowed, the outburst of applause unnerved her, sent her dizzy and almost
                    staggering into the wings. "Splendid! Splendid!" cried Mabel, and Anstruther
                    embraced her, and Tempest and Eshwell kissed her hands. They all joined in
                    pushing her out again for the encore&mdash;"Blue Alsatian Mountains." She
                    did not sing quite so steadily, but got through in good form, the tremolo of
                    nervousness in her voice adding to the wailing pathos of the song's refrain: </p>
                <p> Ade, ade, ade, such dreams must pass away, But the Blue Alsatian Mountains seem
                    to watch and wait alway. </p>
                <p> The crowd clapped, stamped, whistled, shouted; but Burlingham defied it. "The
                    lady will sing again later," he cried. "The next number on the regular program
                    is," etc., etc. The crowd yelled; Burlingham stood firm, and up went the curtain
                    on Eshwell and Connemora's sketch. It got no applause. Nor did any other numbers
                    on the program. The contrast between the others and the beauty of the girl, her
                    delicate sweetness, her vital youth, her freshness of the early morning flower,
                    was inevitable. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0272" n="249"/>
                <p>The crowd could think only of her. The quality of magnetism aside, she had sung
                    neither very well nor very badly. But had she sung badly, still her beauty would
                    have won her the same triumph. When she came on for her second number with a
                    cloud-like azure chiffon flung carelessly over her dark hair as a scarf, Spanish
                    fashion, she received a stirring welcome. It frightened her, so that Pat had to
                    begin four times before her voice faintly took up the tune. Again Burlingham's
                    encouraging, confident gaze, flung across the gap between them like a strong
                    rescuing hand, strengthened her to her task. This time he let the crowd have two
                    encores&mdash;and the show was over; for the astute manager, seeing how the
                    girl had caught on, had moved her second number to the end. </p>
                <p>Burlingham lingered in the entrance to the auditorium to feast himself on the
                    comments of the crowd as it passed out. When he went back he had to search for
                    the girl, found her all in a heap in a chair at the outer edge of the forward
                    deck. She was sobbing piteously. "Well, for God's sake!" cried he. "Is _this_
                    the way you take it!" </p>
                <p>She lifted her head. "Did I do very badly?" she asked. </p>
                <p>"You swept 'em off their big hulking feet," replied he. </p>
                <p>"When you didn't come, I thought I'd disappointed you." </p>
                <p>"I'll bet my hand there never was such a hit made in a river show
                    boat&mdash;and they've graduated some of the swells of the profession. We'll
                    play here a week to crowded houses&mdash;matinees every day, too. And this
                    is a two-night stand usually. I must find some more songs." He slapped his
                    thigh. "The very thing!" he cried. "We'll ring in some hymns. `Rock of Ages,'
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0273" n="250"/> say&mdash;and `Jesus, Lover
                    of my Soul'&mdash;and you can get 'em off in a churchy kind of costume
                    something like a surplice. That'll knock 'em stiff. And Anstruther can dope out
                    the accompaniments on that wheezer. What d'you think?" </p>
                <p>"Whatever you want," said the girl. "Oh, I am so glad!" </p>
                <p>"I don't see how you got through so well," said he. </p>
                <p>"I didn't dare fail," replied Susan. "If I had, I couldn't have faced you." And
                    by the light of the waning moon he saw the passionate gratitude of her sensitive
                    young face. </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;I've done nothing," said he, wiping the tears from his
                    eyes&mdash;for he had his full share of the impulsive, sentimental
                    temperament of his profession. "Pure selfishness." </p>
                <p>Susan gazed at him with eyes of the pure deep violet of strongest feeling. "__I_
                    _know what you did," she said in a low voice. "And&mdash;I'd die for you." </p>
                <p>Burlingham had to use his handkerchief in dealing with his eyes now. "This
                    business has given me hysterics," said he with a queer attempt at a laugh. Then,
                    after a moment, "God bless you, little girl. You wait here a moment. I'll see
                    how supper's getting on." </p>
                <p>He wished to go ahead of her, for he had a shrewd suspicion as to the state of
                    mind of the rest of the company. And he was right. There they sat in the litter
                    of peanut hulls, popcorn, and fruit skins which the audience had left. On every
                    countenance was jealous gloom. </p>
                <p>"What's wrong?" inquired Burlingham in his cheerful derisive way. "You are a nice
                    bunch, you are!" </p>
                <p>They shifted uneasily. Mabel snapped out, "Where's <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0274" n="251"/> the infant prodigy? Is she so stuck
                    on herself already that she won't associate with us?" </p>
                <p>"You grown-up babies," mocked Burlingham. "I found her out there crying in
                    darkness because she thought she'd failed. Now you go bring her in, Conny. As
                    for the rest of you, I'm disgusted. Here we've hit on something that'll land us
                    in Easy Street, and you're all filled up with poison." </p>
                <p>They were ashamed of themselves. Burlingham had brought back to them vividly the
                    girl's simplicity and sweetness that had won their hearts, even the hearts of
                    the women in whom jealousy of her young beauty would have been more than
                    excusable. Anstruther began to get out the supper dishes and Mabel slipped away
                    toward the forward deck. "When the child comes in," pursued Burlingham, "I want
                    to see you people looking and acting human." </p>
                <p>"We are a lot of damn fools," admitted Eshwell. "That's why we're bum actors
                    instead of doing well at some respectable business." </p>
                <p>And his jealousy went the way of Violet's and Mabel's. Pat began to remember that
                    he had shared in the triumph&mdash;where would she have been without his
                    violin work? But Tempest remained somber. In his case better nature was having a
                    particularly hard time of it. His vanity had got savage wounds from the hoots
                    and the "Oh, bite it off, hamfat," which had greeted his impressive lecture on
                    the magic lantern pictures. He eyed Burlingham glumly. He exonerated the girl,
                    but not Burlingham. He was convinced that the manager, in a spirit of mean
                    revenge, had put up a job on him. It simply could not be in the ordinary course
                    that any audience, without some sly trickery of prompting from an old expert of
                    theatrical "double- <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0275" n="252"/> crossing," would
                    be impatient for a mere chit of an amateur when it might listen to his rich,
                    mellow eloquence. </p>
                <p>Susan came shyly&mdash;and at the first glance into her face her associates
                    despised themselves for their pettiness. It is impossible for envy and jealousy
                    and hatred to stand before the light of such a nature as Susan's. Away from her
                    these very human friends of hers might hate her&mdash;but in her presence
                    they could not resist the charm of her sincerity. </p>
                <p>Everyone's spirits went up with the supper. It was Pat who said to Burlingham,
                    "Bob, we're going to let the pullet in on the profits equally, aren't we?" </p>
                <p>"Sure," replied Burlingham. "Anybody kicking?" </p>
                <p>The others protested enthusiastically except Tempest, who shot a glance of fiery
                    scorn at Burlingham over a fork laden with potato salad. "Then&mdash;you're
                    elected, Miss Sackville," said Burlingham. </p>
                <p>Susan's puzzled eyes demanded an explanation. "Just this," said he. "We divide
                    equally at the end of the trip all we've raked in, after the rent of the boat
                    and expenses are taken off. You get your equal share exactly as if you started
                    with us." </p>
                <p>"But that wouldn't be fair," protested the girl. "I must pay what I owe you
                    first." </p>
                <p>"She means two dollars she borrowed of me at Carrollton," explained Burlingham.
                    And they all laughed uproariously. </p>
                <p>"I'll only take what's fair," said the girl. </p>
                <p>"I vote we give it all to her," rolled out Tempest in tragedy's tone for classic
                    satire. </p>
                <p>Before Mabel could hurl at him the probably coarse retort she instantly got her
                    lips ready to make, Burlingham's cool, peace-compelling tones broke in: </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0276"/>
                <p>"Miss Sackville's right. She must get only what's fair. She shares equally from
                    tonight on&mdash;less two dollars." </p>
                <p>Susan nodded delightedly. She did not know&mdash;and the others did not at
                    the excited moment recall&mdash;that the company was to date eleven dollars
                    less well off than when it started from the headwaters of the Ohio in early
                    June. But Burlingham knew, and that was the cause of the quiet grin to which he
                    treated himself. </p>

                <head> XV</head>
                <p> BURLINGHAM had lived too long, too actively, and too intelligently to have left
                    any of his large, original stock of the optimism that had so often shipwrecked
                    his career in spite of his talents and his energy. Out of the bitterness of
                    experience he used to say, "A young optimist is a young fool. An old optimist is
                    an old ass. A fool may learn, an ass can't." And again, "An optimist steams
                    through the fog, taking it for granted everything's all right. A pessimist
                    steams ahead too, but he gets ready for trouble." However, he was wise enough to
                    keep his private misgivings and reservations from his associates; the leaders of
                    the human race always talk optimism and think pessimism. He had told the company
                    that Susan was sure to make a go; and after she had made a go, he announced the
                    beginning of a season of triumph. But he was surprised when his prediction came
                    true and they had to turn people away from the next afternoon's performance. He
                    began to believe they really could stay a week, and hired a man to fill the
                    streets of New Washington and other inland villages and towns of the county with
                    a handbill headlining Susan. </p>
                <p>The news of the lovely young ballad singer in the show boat at Bethlehem spread,
                    as interesting news ever does, and down came the people to see and hear, and to
                    go away exclaiming. Bethlehem, the sleepy, showed that it could wake when there
                    was anything worth waking for. Burlingham put on the hymns in <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0278" n="255"/> the middle of the week, and even the
                    clergy sent their families. Every morning Susan, either with Mabel or with
                    Burlingham, or with both, took a long walk into the country. It was Burlingham,
                    by the way, who taught her the necessity of regular and methodical long walks
                    for the preservation of her health. When she returned there was always a crowd
                    lounging about the landing waiting to gape at her and whisper. It was
                    intoxicating to her, this delicious draught of the heady wine of fame; and
                    Burlingham was not unprepared for the evidences that she thought pretty well of
                    herself, felt that she had arrived. He laughed to himself indulgently. "Let the
                    kiddie enjoy herself," thought he. "She needs the self-confidence now to give
                    her a good foundation to stand on. Then when she finds out what a false alarm
                    this jay excitement was, she'll not be swept clean away into despair." </p>
                <p>The chief element in her happiness, he of course knew nothing about. Until this
                    success&mdash;which she, having no basis for comparison, could not but
                    exaggerate&mdash;she had been crushed and abused more deeply than she had
                    dared admit to herself by her birth which made all the world scorn her and by
                    the series of calamities climaxing in that afternoon and night of horror at
                    Ferguson's. This success&mdash;it seemed to her to give her the right to
                    have been born, the right to live on and hold up her head without effort after
                    Ferguson. "I'll show them all, before I get through," she said to herself over
                    and over again. "They'll be proud of me. Ruth will be boasting to everyone that
                    I'm her cousin. And Sam Wright&mdash;he'll wonder that he ever dared touch
                    such a famous, great woman." She only half believed this herself, for she had
                    much common sense and small self-confidence. But pretending that <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0279" n="256"/> she believed it all gave her the most
                    delicious pleasure. </p>
                <p>Burlingham took such frank joy in her innocent vanity&mdash;so far as he
                    understood it and so far as she exhibited it&mdash;that the others were
                    good-humored about it too&mdash;all the others except Tempest, whom conceit
                    and defeat had long since soured through and through. A tithe of Susan's success
                    would have made him unbearable, for like most human beings he had a vanity that
                    was Atlantosaurian on starvation rations and would have filled the whole earth
                    if it had been fed a few crumbs. Small wonder that we are ever eagerly on the
                    alert for signs of vanity in others; we are seeking the curious comfort there is
                    in the feeling that others have our own weakness to a more ridiculous degree.
                    Tempest twitched to jeer openly at Susan, whose exhibition was really timid and
                    modest and not merely excusable but justifiable. But he dared go no further than
                    holding haughtily aloof and casting vaguely into the air ever and anon a tragic
                    sneer. Susan would not have understood if she had seen, and did not see. She was
                    treading the heights, her eyes upon the sky. She held grave consultation with
                    Burlingham, with Violet, with Mabel, about improving her part. She took it all
                    very, very seriously&mdash;and Burlingham was glad of that. "Yes, she does
                    take herself seriously," he admitted to Anstruther. "But that won't do any harm
                    as she's so young, and as she takes her work seriously, too. The trouble about
                    taking oneself seriously is it stops growth. She hasn't got that form of it." </p>
                <p>"Not yet," said Violet. </p>
                <p>"She'll wake from her little dream, poor child, long before the fatal stage." And
                    he heaved a sigh <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0280" n="257"/> for his own lost
                    illusions&mdash;those illusions that had cost him so dear. </p>
                <p>Burlingham had intended to make at least one stop before Jeffersonville, the
                    first large town on the way down. But Susan's capacities as a house-filler
                    decided him for pushing straight for it. "We'll go where there's a big
                    population to be drawn on," said he. But he did not say that in the back of his
                    head there was forming a plan to take a small theater at Jeffersonville if the
                    girl made a hit there. </p>
                <p>Eshwell, to whom he was talking, looked glum. "She's going pretty good with these
                    greenies," observed he. "But I've my doubts whether city people'll care for
                    anything so milk-like." </p>
                <p>Burlingham had his doubts, too; but he retorted warmly: "Don't you believe it,
                    Eshie. City's an outside. Underneath, there's still the simple, honest,
                    grassy-green heart of the country." </p>
                <p>Eshwell laughed. "So you've stopped jeering at jays. You've forgotten what a lot
                    of tightwads and petty swindlers they are. Well, I don't blame you. Now that
                    they're giving down to us so freely, I feel better about them myself. It's a
                    pity we can't lower the rest of the program to the level of their
                    intellectuals." </p>
                <p>Burlingham was not tactless enough to disturb Eshwell's consoling notion that
                    while Susan was appreciated by these ignorant country-jakes, the rest of the
                    company were too subtle and refined in their art. "That's a good idea," replied
                    he. "I'll try to get together some simple slop. Perhaps a melodrama, a good hot
                    one, would go&mdash;eh?" </p>
                <p>After ten days the receipts began to drop. On the fifteenth day there was only a
                    handful at the matinee, <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0281" n="258"/> and in the
                    evening half the benches were empty. "About milked dry," said Burlingham at the
                    late supper. "We'll move on in the morning." </p>
                <p>This pleased everyone. Susan saw visions of bigger triumphs; the others felt that
                    they were going where dramatic talent, not to say genius, would be at least not
                    entirely unappreciated. So the company was at its liveliest next morning as the
                    mosquito-infested willows of the Bethlehem shore slowly dropped away. They had
                    made an unusually early start, for the river would be more and more crowded as
                    they neared the three close-set cities&mdash;Louisville, Jeffersonville, and
                    New Albany, and the helpless little show boat must give the steamers no excuse
                    for not seeing her. All day&mdash;a long, dreamy, summer day&mdash;they
                    drifted lazily downstream, and, except Tempest, all grew gayer and more gay.
                    Burlingham had announced that there were three hundred and seventy-eight dollars
                    in the japanned tin box he kept shut up in his bag. </p>
                <p>At dusk a tug, for three dollars, nosed them into a wharf which adjoined the
                    thickly populated labor quarter of Jeffersonville. </p>
                <p> Susan was awakened by a scream. Even as she opened her eyes a dark cloud, a dull
                    suffocating terrifying pain, descended upon her. When she again became
                    conscious, she was lying upon a mass of canvas on the levee with three strange
                    men bending over her. She sat up, instinctively caught together the front of the
                    nightdress she had bought in Bethlehem the second day there. Then she looked
                    wildly from face to face. </p>
                <p>"You're all right, ma'am," said one of the men. "Not a scratch&mdash;only
                    stunned." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0282" n="259"/>
                <p>"What was it?" said the girl. "Where are they?" </p>
                <p>As she spoke, she saw Burlingham in his nightshirt propped against a big blue oil
                    barrel. He was staring stupidly at the ground. And now she noted the others
                    scattered about the levee, each with a group around him or her. "What was it?"
                    she repeated. </p>
                <p>"A tug butted its tow of barges into you," said someone. "Crushed your boat like
                    an eggshell." </p>
                <p>Burlingham staggered to his feet, stared round, saw her. "Thank God!" he cried.
                    "Anyone drowned? Anyone hurt?" </p>
                <p>"All saved&mdash;no bones broken," someone responded. </p>
                <p>"And the boat?" </p>
                <p>"Gone down. Nothing left of her but splinters. The barges were full of coal and
                    building stone." </p>
                <p>"The box!" suddenly shouted Burlingham. "The box!" </p>
                <p>"What kind of a box?" asked a boy with lean, dirty, and much scratched bare legs.
                    "A little black tin box like they keep money in?" </p>
                <p>"That's it. Where is it?" </p>
                <p>"It's all right," said the boy. "One of your people, a black actor-looking
                    fellow&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Tempest," interjected Burlingham. "Go on." </p>
                <p>"He dressed on the wharf and he had the box." </p>
                <p>"Where is he?" </p>
                <p>"He said he was going for a doctor. Last I seed of him he was up to the corner
                    yonder. He was movin' fast." </p>
                <p>Burlingham gave a kind of groan. Susan read in his face his fear, his
                    suspicion&mdash;the suspicion he was ashamed of himself for having. She
                    noted vaguely that he talked with the policeman aside for a few minutes, after
                    which the policeman went up the levee. Burlingham <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0283" n="260"/> rejoined his companions and took
                    command. The first thing was to get dressed as well as might be from such of the
                    trunks as had been knocked out of the cabin by the barge and had been picked up.
                    They were all dazed. Even Burlingham could not realize just what had occurred.
                    They called to one another more or less humorous remarks while they were
                    dressing behind piles of boxes, crates, barrels and sacks in the wharf-boat. And
                    they laughed gayly when they assembled. Susan made the best appearance, for her
                    blue serge suit had been taken out dry when she herself was lifted from the
                    sinking wreck; the nightgown served as a blouse. Mabel's trunk had been saved.
                    Violet could wear none of her things, as they were many sizes too small, so she
                    appeared in a property skirt of black paper muslin, a black velvet property
                    basque, a pair of shoes belonging to Tempest. Burlingham and Eshwell made a
                    fairly respectable showing in clothing from Tempest's trunk. Their own trunks
                    had gone down. </p>
                <p>"Why, where's Tempest?" asked Eshwell. </p>
                <p>"He'll be back in a few minutes," replied Burlingham. "In fact, he ought to be
                    back now." His glance happened to meet Susan's; he hastily shifted his eyes. </p>
                <p>"Where's the box?" asked Violet. </p>
                <p>"Tempest's taking care of it," was the manager's answer. </p>
                <p>"Tempest!" exclaimed Mabel. Her shrewd, dissipated eyes contracted with
                    suspicion. </p>
                <p>"Anybody got any money?" inquired Eshwell, as he fished in his pockets. </p>
                <p>No one had a cent. Eshwell searched Tempest's trunk, found a two-dollar bill and
                    a one wrapped round a silver dollar and wadded in among some ragged
                    underclothes. Susan heard Burlingham mutter "Wonder <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0284" n="261"/> how he happened to overlook that!"
                    But no one else heard. </p>
                <p>"Well, we might have breakfast," suggested Mabel. </p>
                <p>They went out on the water deck of the wharf-boat, looked down at the splinters
                    of the wreck lying in the deep yellow river. "Come on," said Burlingham, and he
                    led the way up the levee. There was no attempt at jauntiness; they all realized
                    now. </p>
                <p>"How about Tempest?" said Eshwell, stopping short halfway up. </p>
                <p>"Tempest&mdash;hell!" retorted Mabel. "Come on." </p>
                <p>"What do you mean?" cried Violet, whose left eye was almost closed by a bruise. </p>
                <p>"We'll not see him again. Come on." </p>
                <p>"Bob!" shrieked Violet at Burlingham. "Do you hear that?" </p>
                <p>"Yes," said he. "Keep calm, and come on. " </p>
                <p>"Aren't you going to _do_ anything?" she screamed, seizing him by the coat tail.
                    "You must, damn it&mdash;you must!" </p>
                <p>"I got the policeman to telephone headquarters," said Burlingham. "What else can
                    be done? Come on." </p>
                <p>And a moment later the bedraggled and dejected company filed into a cheap levee
                    restaurant. "Bring some coffee," Burlingham said to the waiter. Then to the
                    others, "Does anybody want anything else?" No one spoke. "Coffee's all," he said
                    to the waiter. </p>
                <p>It came, and they drank it in silence, each one's brain busy with the disaster
                    from the standpoint of his own resulting ruin. Susan glanced furtively at each
                    face in turn. She could not think of her own fate, there was such despair in the
                    faces of these others. Mabel looked like an old woman. As for Violet, every
                    feature of her homeliness, her coarseness, her dissipated premature <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0285" n="262"/> old age stood forth in all its
                    horror. Susan's heart contracted and her flesh crept as she glanced quickly
                    away. But she still saw, and it was many a week before she ceased to see
                    whenever Violet's name came into her mind. Burlingham, too, looked old and
                    broken. Eshwell and Pat, neither of whom had ever had the smallest taste of
                    success, were stolid, like cornered curs taking their beating and waiting in
                    silence for the blows to stop. </p>
                <p>"Here, Eshie," said the manager, "take care of the three dollars." And he handed
                    him the bills. "I'll pay for the coffee and keep the change. I'm going down to
                    the owners of that tug and see what I can do." </p>
                <p>When he had paid they followed him out. At the curbstone he said, "Keep together
                    somewhere round the wharf-boat. So long." He lifted the battered hat he was
                    wearing, smiled at Susan. "Cheer up, Miss Sackville. We'll down 'em yet!" And
                    away he went&mdash;a strange figure, his burly frame squeezed into a dingy
                    old frock suit from among Tempest's costumes. </p>
                <p>A dreary two hours, the last half-hour in a drizzling rain from which the narrow
                    eaves of the now closed and locked wharf-boat sheltered them only a little.
                    "There he comes!" cried Susan; and sure enough, Burlingham separated from the
                    crowd streaming along the street at the top of the levee, and began to descend
                    the slope toward them. They concentrated on his face, hoping to get some
                    indication of what to expect; but he never permitted his face to betray his
                    mind. He strode up the plank and joined them. </p>
                <p>"Tempest come?" he asked. </p>
                <p>"Tempest!" cried Mabel. "Haven't I told you he's jumped? Don't you suppose __I_
                    _know him?" </p>
                <p>"And you brought him into the company," raged <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0286"
                        n="263"/> Violet. "Burlingham didn't want to take him. He looked the fool
                    and jackass he is. Why didn't you warn us he was a rotten thief, too?" </p>
                <p>"Wasn't it for shoplifting you served six months in Joliet?" retorted Mabel. </p>
                <p>"You lie&mdash;you streetwalker!" screamed Violet. </p>
                <p>"Ladies! Ladies!" said Eshwell. </p>
                <p>"That's what __I__ say," observed Pat. </p>
                <p>"I'm no lady," replied Mabel. "I'm an actress." </p>
                <p>"An actress&mdash;he-he!" jeered Violet. "An actress!" </p>
                <p>"Shut up, all of you," commanded Burlingham. "I've got some money. I settled for
                    cash." </p>
                <p>"How much?" cried Mabel and Violet in the same breath, their quarrel not merely
                    finished but forgotten. </p>
                <p>"Three hundred dollars." </p>
                <p>"For the boat and all?" demanded Eshwell. "Why, Bob&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"They think it was for boat and all," interrupted Burlingham with his cynical
                    smile. "They set out to bully and cheat me. They knew I couldn't get justice. So
                    I let 'em believe I owned the boat&mdash;and I've got fifty apiece for us." </p>
                <p>"Sixty," said Violet. </p>
                <p>"Fifty. There are six of us." </p>
                <p>"You don't count in this little Jonah here, do you?" cried Violet, scowling
                    evilly at Susan. </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;don't count me in," begged Susan. "I didn't lose
                    anything." </p>
                <p>Mabel pinched her arm. "You're right, Mr. Burlingham," said she. "Miss Sackville
                    ought to share. We're all in the same box." </p>
                <p>"Miss Sackville will share," said Burlingham. "There's going to be no skunking
                    about this, as long as I'm in charge." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0287" n="264"/>
                <p>Eshwell and Pat sided with Violet. While the rain streamed, the five, with Susan
                    a horrified onlooker, fought on and on about the division of the money. Their
                    voices grew louder. They hurled the most frightful epithets at one another.
                    Violet seized Mabel by the hair, and the men interfered, all but coming to blows
                    themselves in the melee. The wharfmaster rushed from his office, drove them off
                    to the levee. They continued to yell and curse, even Burlingham losing control
                    of himself and releasing all there was of the tough and the blackguard in his
                    nature. Two policemen came, calmed them with threat of arrest. At last
                    Burlingham took from his pocket one at a time three small rolls of bills. He
                    flung one at each of the three who were opposing his division. "Take that, you
                    dirty curs," he said. "And be glad I'm giving you anything at all. Most managers
                    wouldn't have come back. Come on, Miss Sackville. Come on, Mabel." And the two
                    followed him up the levee, leaving the others counting their shares. </p>
                <p>At the street corner they went into a general store where Burlingham bought two
                    ninety-eight-cent umbrellas. He gave Mabel one, held the other over Susan and
                    himself as they walked along. "Well, ladies," said he, "we begin life again. A
                    clean slate, a fresh start&mdash;as if nothing had ever happened." </p>
                <p>Susan looked at him to try to give him a grateful and sympathetic smile. She was
                    surprised to see that, so far as she could judge, he had really meant the words
                    he had spoken. </p>
                <p>"Yes, I mean it," said he. "Always look at life as it is&mdash;as a game.
                    With every deal, whether you win or lose, your stake grows&mdash;for your
                    stake's your wits, and you add to 'em by learning something with each deal. What
                    are you going to do, Mabel?" </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0288" n="265"/>
                <p>"Get some clothes. The water wrecked mine and this rain has finished my hat." </p>
                <p>"We'll go together," said Burlingham. </p>
                <p>They took a car for Louisville, descended before a department store. Burlingham
                    had to fit himself from the skin out; Mabel had underclothes, needed a hat, a
                    dress, summer shoes. Susan needed underclothes, shoes, a hat, for she was
                    bareheaded. They arranged to meet at the first entrance down the side street;
                    Burlingham gave Susan and Mabel each their fifty dollars and went his way. When
                    they met again in an hour and a half, they burst into smiles of delight.
                    Burlingham had transformed himself into a jaunty, fashionable young middle-aged
                    man, with an air of success achieved and prosperity assured. He had put the fine
                    finishing touch to his transformation by getting a haircut and a shave. Mabel
                    looked like a showy chorus girl, in a striped blue and white linen suit, a big
                    beflowered hat, and a fluffy blouse of white chiffon. Susan had resisted Mabel's
                    entreaties, had got a plain, sensible linen blouse of a kind that on a pinch
                    might be washed out and worn without ironing. Her new hat was a simple blue
                    sailor with a dark blue band that matched her dress. </p>
                <p>"I spent thirty-six dollars," said Burlingham. </p>
                <p>"I only spent twenty-two," declared Mabel. "And this child here only parted with
                    seven of her dollars. </p>
                <p>I had no idea she was so thrifty. " </p>
                <p>"And now&mdash;what?" said Burlingham. </p>
                <p>"I'm going round to see a friend of mine," replied Mabel. "She's on the stage,
                    too. There's sure to be something doing at the summer places. Maybe I can ring
                    Miss Sackville in. There ought to be a good living in those eyes of hers and
                    those feet and ankles. I'm sure I can put her next to something." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0289" n="266"/>

                <p>"Then you can give her your address," said Burlingham. </p>
                <p>"Why, she's going with me," cried Mabel. "You don't suppose I'd leave the child
                    adrift?" </p>
                <p>"No, she's going with me to a boarding house I'll find for her," said Burlingham. </p>
                <p>Into Mabel's face flashed the expression of the suspicion such a statement would
                    at once arouse in a mind trained as hers had been. Burlingham's look drove the
                    expression out of her face, and suspicion at least into the background. "She's
                    not going with your friend," said Burlingham, a hint of sternness in his voice.
                    "That's best&mdash;isn't it?" </p>
                <p>Miss Connemora's eyes dropped. "Yes, I guess it is," replied she.
                    "Well&mdash;I turn down this way." </p>
                <p>"We'll keep on and go out Chestnut Street," said Burlingham. "You can write to
                    her&mdash;or to me&mdash;care of the General Delivery." </p>
                <p>"That's best. You may hear from Tempest. You can write me there, too." Mabel was
                    constrained and embarrassed. "Good-by, Miss Sackville." </p>
                <p>Susan embraced and kissed her. Mabel began to weep. "Oh, it's all so
                    sudden&mdash;and frightful," she said. "Do try to be good, Lorna. You can
                    trust Bob." She looked earnestly, appealingly, at him. "Yes, I'm sure you can.
                    And&mdash;he's right about me. Good-by." She hurried away, not before Susan
                    had seen the tears falling from her kind, fast-fading eyes. </p>
                <p>Susan stood looking after her. And for the first time the truth about the
                    catastrophe came to her. She turned to Burlingham. "How brave you are!" she
                    cried. </p>
                <p>"Oh, what'd be the use in dropping down and howling <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0290"/> like a dog?" replied he. "That wouldn't bring
                    the boat back. It wouldn't get me a job." </p>
                <p>"And you shared equally, when you lost the most of all." </p>
                <p>They were walking on. "The boat was mine, too," said he in a dry reflective tone.
                    "I told 'em it wasn't when we started out because I wanted to get a good share
                    for rent and so on, without any kicking from anybody." </p>
                <p>The loss did not appeal to her; it was the lie he had told. She felt her
                    confidence shaking. "You didn't mean to&mdash;to&mdash;" she faltered,
                    stopped. </p>
                <p>"To cheat them?" suggested he. "Yes, I did. So&mdash;to sort of balance
                    things up I divided equally all I got from the tug people. What're you looking
                    so unhappy about?" </p>
                <p>"I wish you hadn't told me," she said miserably. "I don't see why you did." </p>
                <p>"Because I don't want you making me into a saint. I'm like the rest you see about
                    in pants, cheating and lying, with or without pretending to themselves that
                    they're honest. Don't trust anybody, my dear. The sooner you get over the habit,
                    the sooner you'll cease to tempt people to be hypocrites. All the serious
                    trouble I've ever got into has come through trusting or being trusted." </p>
                <p>He looked gravely at her, burst out laughing at her perplexed, alarmed
                    expression. "Oh, Lord, it isn't as bad as all that," said he. "The rain's
                    stopped. Let's have breakfast. Then&mdash;a new deal&mdash;with
                    everything to gain and nothing to lose. It's a great advantage to be in a
                    position where you've got nothing to lose!" </p>

                <head> XVI</head>
                <p> BURLINGHAM found for her a comfortable room in a flat in West Chestnut
                    Street&mdash;a respectable middle-class neighborhood with three churches in
                    full view and the spires of two others visible over the housetops. Her landlady
                    was Mrs. Redding, a simple-hearted, deaf old widow with bright kind eyes beaming
                    guilelessness through steel-framed spectacles. Mrs. Redding had only recently
                    been reduced to the necessity of letting a room. She stated her moderate
                    price&mdash;seven dollars a week for room and board&mdash;as if she
                    expected to be arrested for attempted extortion. "I give good meals," she
                    hastened to add. "I do the cooking myself&mdash;and buy the best. I'm no
                    hand for canned stuff. As for that there cold storage, it's no better'n slow
                    poison, and not so terrible slow at that. Anything your daughter wants I'll give
                    her." </p>
                <p>"She's not my daughter," said Burlingham, and it was his turn to be red and
                    flustered. "I'm simply looking after her, as she's alone in the world. I'm going
                    to live somewhere else. But I'll come here for meals, if you're willing, ma'am." </p>
                <p>"I&mdash;I'd have to make that extry, I'm afraid," pleaded Mrs. Redding. </p>
                <p>"Rather!" exclaimed Burlingham. "I eat like a pair of Percherons." </p>
                <p>"How much did you calculate to pay?" inquired the widow. Her one effort at price
                    fixing, though entirely successful, had exhausted her courage. </p>
                <p>Burlingham was clear out of his class in those idyllic <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0292" n="269"/> days of protector of innocence. He
                    proceeded to be more than honest. </p>
                <p>"Oh, say five a week." </p>
                <p>"Gracious! That's too much," protested she. "I hate to charge a body for food,
                    somehow. It don't seem to be accordin' to what God tells us. But I don't see no
                    way out." </p>
                <p>"I'll come for five not a cent less," insisted Burlingham. "I want to feel free
                    to eat as much as I like." And it was so arranged. Away he went to look up his
                    acquaintances, while Susan sat listening to the widow and trying to convince her
                    that she and Mr. Burlingham didn't want and couldn't possibly eat all the things
                    she suggested as suitable for a nice supper. Susan had been learning rapidly
                    since she joined the theatrical profession. She saw why this fine old woman was
                    getting poorer steadily, was arranging to spend her last years in an almshouse.
                    What a queer world it was! What a strange way for a good God to order things!
                    The better you were, the worse off you were. No doubt it was Burlingham's
                    lifelong goodness of heart as shown in his generosity to her, that had kept him
                    down. It was the same way with her dead mother&mdash;she had been loving and
                    trusting, had given generously without thought of self, with generous confidence
                    in the man she loved&mdash;and had paid with reputation and life. </p>
                <p>She compelled Burlingham to take what was left of her fifty dollars. "You
                    wouldn't like to make me feel mean," was the argument she used. "I must put in
                    what I've got&mdash;the same as you do. Now, isn't that fair?" And as he was
                    dead broke and had been unable to borrow, he did not oppose vigorously. </p>
                <p>She assumed that after a day or two spent in getting his bearings he would take
                    her with him as he went looking. <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0293" n="270"/> When
                    she suggested it, he promptly vetoed it. "That isn't the way business is done in
                    the profession," said he. "The star&mdash;you're the star&mdash;keeps in
                    the background, and her manager&mdash;that's me does the hustling." </p>
                <p>She had every reason for believing this; but as the days passed with no results,
                    sitting about waiting began to get upon her nerves. Mrs. Redding had the remnant
                    of her dead husband's library, and he had been a man of broad taste in
                    literature. But Susan, ardent reader though she was, could not often lose
                    herself in books now. She was too impatient for realities, too anxious about
                    them. </p>
                <p>Burlingham remained equable, neither hopeful nor gloomy; he made her feel that he
                    was strong, and it gave her strength. Thus she was not depressed when on the
                    last day of their week he said: "I think we'd better push on to Cincinnati
                    tomorrow. There's nothing here, and we've got to get placed before our cash
                    gives out. In Cincinnati there are a dozen places to one in this snide town." </p>
                <p>The idea of going to Cincinnati gave her a qualm of fear; but it passed away when
                    she considered how she had dropped out of the world. "They think I'm dead," she
                    reflected. "Anyhow, I'd never be looked for among the kind of people I'm in with
                    now." The past with which she had broken seemed so far away and so dim to her
                    that she could not but feel it must seem so to those who knew her in her former
                    life. She had such a sense of her own insignificance, now that she knew
                    something of the vastness and business of the world, that she was without a
                    suspicion of the huge scandal and excitement her disappearance had caused in
                    Sutherland. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0294" n="271"/>
                <p>To Cincinnati they went next day by the L. and N. and took two tiny rooms in the
                    dingy old Walnut Street House, at a special rate&mdash;five dollars a week
                    for the two, as a concession to the profession. "We'll eat in cheap restaurants
                    and spread our capital out," said Burlingham. "I want you to get placed _right_,
                    not just placed." He bought a box of blacking and a brush, instructed her in the
                    subtle art of making a front&mdash;an art whereof he was past master, as
                    Susan had long since learned. "Never let yourself look poor or act poor, until
                    you simply have to throw up the sponge," said he. "The world judges by
                    appearances. Put your first money and your last into clothes. And
                    never&mdash;never&mdash;tell a hard-luck story. Always seem to be doing
                    well and comfortably looking out for a chance to do better. The whole world runs
                    from seedy people and whimperers." </p>
                <p>"Am I&mdash;that way?" she asked nervously. </p>
                <p>"Not a bit," declared he. "The day you came up to me in Carrollton I knew you
                    were playing in the hardest kind of hard luck because of what I had happened to
                    see and hear&mdash;and guess. But you weren't looking for pity&mdash;and
                    that was what I liked. And it made me feel you had the stuff in you. I'd not
                    waste breath teaching a whiner or a cheap skate. You couldn't be cheap if you
                    tried. The reason I talk to you about these things is so you'll learn to put the
                    artistic touches by instinct into what you do." </p>
                <p>"You've taken too much trouble for me," said the girl. "Don't you believe it, my
                    dear," laughed he. "If I can do with you what I hope&mdash;I've an instinct
                    that if I win out for you, I'll come into my own at last." </p>
                <p>"You've taught me a lot," said she. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0295" n="272"/>
                <p>"I wonder," replied he. "That is, I wonder how much you've learned. Perhaps
                    enough to keep you&mdash;not to keep from being knocked down by fate, but to
                    get on your feet afterward. I hope so&mdash;I hope so." </p>
                <p>They dropped coffee, bought milk by the bottle, he smuggling it to their rooms
                    disguised as a roll of newspapers. They carried in rolls also, and cut down
                    their restaurant meals to supper which they got for twenty-five cents apiece at
                    a bakery restaurant in Seventh Street. There is a way of resorting to these
                    little economies&mdash;a snobbish, self-despairing way&mdash;that makes
                    them sordid and makes the person indulging in them sink lower and lower. But
                    Burlingham could not have taken that way. He was the adventurer born, was a
                    hardy seasoned campaigner who had never looked on life in the snob's way, had
                    never felt the impulse to apologize for his defeats or to grow haughty over his
                    successes. Susan was an apt pupil; and for the career that lay before her his
                    instructions were invaluable. He was teaching her how to keep the craft afloat
                    and shipshape through the worst weather that can sweep the sea of life. </p>
                <p>"How do you make yourself look always neat and clean?" he asked. </p>
                <p>She confessed: "I wash out my things at night and hang them on the inside of the
                    shutters to dry. They're ready to wear again in the morning." </p>
                <p>"Getting on!" cried he, full of admiration. "They simply can't down us, and they
                    might as well give up trying." </p>
                <p>"But I don't look neat," sighed she. "I can't iron." </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;that's the devil of it," laughed he. He pulled aside his waistcoat
                    and she saw he was wearing a dickey. <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0296" n="273"/>
                    "And my cuffs are pinned in," he said. "I have to be careful about raising and
                    lowering my arms." </p>
                <p>"Can't I wash out some things for you?" she said, then hurried on to put it more
                    strongly. "Yes, give them to me when we get back to the hotel." </p>
                <p>"It does help a man to feel he's clean underneath. And we've got nothing to waste
                    on laundries." </p>
                <p>"I wish I hadn't spent that fifteen cents to have my heels straightened and new
                    steels put in them." She had sat in a cobbler's while this repair to the part of
                    her person she was most insistent upon had been effected. </p>
                <p>He laughed. "A good investment, that," said he. "I've been noticing how you
                    always look nice about the feet. Keep it up. The surest sign of a sloven and a
                    failure, of a moral, mental, and physical no-good is down-at-the-heel. Always
                    keep your heels straight, Lorna." </p>
                <p>And never had he given her a piece of advice more to her liking. She thought she
                    knew now why she had always been so particular about her boots and shoes, her
                    slippers and her stockings. He had given her a new confidence in
                    herself&mdash;in a strength within her somewhere beneath the weakness she
                    was always seeing and feeling. </p>
                <p>Not until she thought it out afterward did she realize what they were passing
                    through, what frightful days of failure he was enduring. He acted like the
                    steady-nerved gambler at life that he was. He was not one of those more or less
                    weak losers who have to make desperate efforts to conceal a fainting heart. His
                    heart was not fainting. He simply played calmly on, feeling that the next throw
                    was as likely to be for as against him. She kept close to her room, walking
                    about there <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0297" n="274"/> &mdash;she had never
                    been much of a sitter&mdash;thinking, practicing the new songs he had got
                    for her&mdash;character songs in which he trained her as well as he could
                    without music or costume or any of the accessories. He also had an idea for a
                    church scene, with her in a choir boy's costume, singing the most moving of the
                    simple religious songs to organ music. She from time to time urged him to take
                    her on the rounds with him. But he stood firm, giving always the same reason of
                    the custom in the profession. Gradually, perhaps by some form of that curious
                    process of infiltration that goes on between two minds long in intimate contact,
                    the conviction came to her that the reason he alleged was not his real reason;
                    but as she had absolute confidence in him she felt that there was some good
                    reason or he would not keep her in the background&mdash;and that his silence
                    about it must be respected. So she tried to hide from him how weary and
                    heartsick inaction was making her, how hard it was for her to stay alone so many
                    hours each day. </p>
                <p>As he watched her closely, it soon dawned on him that something was wrong, and
                    after a day or so he worked out the explanation. He found a remedy&mdash;the
                    reading room of the public library where she could make herself almost content
                    the whole day long. </p>
                <p>He began to have a haggard look, and she saw he was sick, was keeping up his
                    strength with whisky. "It's only this infernal summer cold I caught in the
                    smashup," he explained. "I can't shake it, but neither can it get me down. I'd
                    not dare fall sick. What'd become of _us_?" </p>
                <p>She knew that "us" meant only herself. Her mind had been aging rapidly in those
                    long periods of unbroken reflection. To develop a human being, leave him or her
                    alone most of the time; it is too much company, <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0298"
                        n="275"/> too little time to digest and assimilate, that keep us thoughtless
                    and unformed until life is half over. She astonished him by suddenly announcing
                    one evening: </p>
                <p>"I am a drag on you. I'm going to take a place in a store." </p>
                <p>He affected an indignation so artistic that it ought to have been convincing.
                    "I'm ashamed of you!" he cried. "I see you're losing your nerve." </p>
                <p>This was ingenious, but it did not succeed. "You can't deceive me any longer,"
                    was her steady answer. "Tell me honest&mdash;couldn't you have got something
                    to do long ago, if it hadn't been for trying to do something for me?" </p>
                <p>"Sure," replied he, too canny to deny the obvious. "But what has that to do with
                    it? If I'd had a living offer, I'd have taken it. But at my age a man doesn't
                    dare take certain kinds of places. It'd settle him for life. And I'm playing for
                    a really big stake and I'll win. When I get what I want for you, we'll make as
                    much money a month as I could make a year. Trust me, my dear." </p>
                <p>It was plausible; and her "loss of nerve" was visibly aggravating his
                    condition&mdash;the twitching of hands and face, the terrifying brightness
                    of his eyes, of the color in the deep hollows under his cheek bones. But she
                    felt that she must persist. "How much money have we got?" she asked. </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;a great deal enough." </p>
                <p>"You must play square with me," said she. "I'm not a baby, but a
                    woman&mdash;and your partner." </p>
                <p>"Don't worry me, child. We'll talk about it tomorrow." </p>
                <p>"How much? You've no right to hide things from me. You&mdash;hurt me." </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0299" n="276"/>
                <p>"Eleven dollars and eighty cents&mdash;when this bill for supper's paid and
                    the waitress tipped." </p>
                <p>"I'll try for a place in a store," said she. </p>
                <p>"Don't talk that way or think that way," cried he angrily. "There's where so many
                    people fail in life. They don't stick to their game. I wish to God I'd had sense
                    enough to break straight for Chicago or New York. But it's too late now. What I
                    lack is nerve&mdash;nerve to do the big, bold things my brains show me I
                    ought." </p>
                <p>His distress was so obvious that she let the subject drop. That night she lay
                    awake as she had fallen into the habit of doing. But instead of purposeless,
                    rambling thoughts, she was trying definitely to plan a search for work. Toward
                    three in the morning she heard him tossing and muttering&mdash;for the wall
                    between their rooms was merely plastered laths covered with paper. She tried his
                    door; it was locked. She knocked, got no answer but incoherent ravings. She
                    roused the office, and the night porter forced the door. Burlingham's gas was
                    lighted; he was sitting up in bed&mdash;a haggard, disheveled, insane man,
                    raving on and on&mdash;names of men and women she had never
                    heard&mdash;oaths, disjointed sentences. </p>
                <p>"Brain fever, I reckon," said the porter. "I'll call a doctor." </p>
                <p>In a few minutes Susan was gladdened by the sight of a young man wearing the
                    familiar pointed beard and bearing the familiar black bag. He made a careful
                    examination, asked her many questions, finally said: </p>
                <p>"Your father has typhoid, I fear. He must be taken to a hospital." </p>
                <p>"But we have very little money," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"I understand," replied the doctor, marveling at the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0300" n="277"/> calmness of one so young. "The
                    hospital I mean is free. I'll send for an ambulance." </p>
                <p>While they were waiting beside Burlingham, whom the doctor had drugged into
                    unconsciousness with a hypodermic, Susan said: "Can I go to the hospital and
                    take care of him?" </p>
                <p>"No," replied the doctor. "You can only call and inquire how he is, until he's
                    well enough to see you." </p>
                <p>"And how long will that be?" </p>
                <p>"I can't say." He hadn't the courage to tell her it would be three weeks at
                    least, perhaps six or seven. </p>
                <p>He got leave of the ambulance surgeon for Susan to ride to the hospital, and he
                    went along himself. As the ambulance sped through the dimly lighted streets with
                    clanging bell and heavy pounding of the horse's hoofs on the granite pavement,
                    Susan knelt beside Burlingham, holding one of his hot hands. She was remembering
                    how she had said that she would die for him&mdash;and here it was he that
                    was dying for her. And her heart was heavy with a load of guilt, the heaviest
                    she was ever to feel in her life. She could not know how misfortune is really
                    the lot of human beings; it seemed to her that a special curse attended her,
                    striking down all who befriended her. </p>
                <p>They dashed up to great open doors of the hospital. Burlingham was lifted, was
                    carried swiftly into the receiving room. Susan with tearless eyes bent over,
                    embraced him lingeringly, kissed his fiery brow, his wasted cheeks. One of the
                    surgeons in white duck touched her on the arm. </p>
                <p>"We can't delay," he said. </p>
                <p>"No indeed," she replied, instantly drawing back. </p>
                <p>She watched the stretcher on wheels go noiselessly down the corridor toward the
                    elevator and when it was <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0301" n="278"/> gone she
                    still continued to look. "You can come at any hour to inquire," said the young
                    doctor who had accompanied her. "Now we'll go into the office and have the slip
                    made out." </p>
                <p>They entered a small room, divided unequally by a barrier desk; behind it stood a
                    lean, coffee-sallowed young man with a scrawny neck displayed to the uttermost
                    by a standing collar scarcely taller than the band of a shirt. He directed at
                    Susan one of those obtrusively shrewd glances which shallow people practice and
                    affect to create the impression that they have a genius for character reading.
                    He drew a pad of blank forms toward him, wiped a pen on the mat into which his
                    mouse-colored hair was roached above his right temple. "Well, miss, what's the
                    patient's name?" </p>
                <p>"Robert Burlingham." </p>
                <p>"Age?" </p>
                <p>"I don't know." </p>
                <p>"About what?" </p>
                <p>"I&mdash;I don't know. I guess he isn't very young. But I don't know." </p>
                <p>"Put down forty, Sim," said the doctor. </p>
                <p>"Very well, Doctor Hamilton." Then to Susan: "Color white, I suppose. Nativity?" </p>
                <p>Susan recalled that she had heard him speak of Liverpool as his birthplace.
                    "English," said she. </p>
                <p>"Profession?" </p>
                <p>"Actor." </p>
                <p>"Residence?" </p>
                <p>"He hasn't any. It was sunk at Jeffersonville. We stop at the Walnut Street
                    House." </p>
                <p>"Walnut Street House. Was he married or single?" </p>
                <p>"Single." Then she recalled some of the disconnected ravings.
                    "I&mdash;I&mdash;don't know." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0302" n="279"/>
                <p>"Single," said the clerk. "No, I guess I'll put it widower. Next friend or
                    relative?" </p>
                <p>"I am. " </p>
                <p>"Daughter. First name?" </p>
                <p>"I am not his daughter. " </p>
                <p>"Oh, niece. Full name, please." </p>
                <p>"I am no relation&mdash;just his&mdash;his friend." </p>
                <p>Sim the clerk looked up sharply. Hamilton reddened, glowered at him. "I
                    understand," said Sim, leering at her. And in a tone that reeked insinuation
                    which quite escaped her, he went on, "We'll put your name down. What is it?" </p>
                <p>"Lorna Sackville." </p>
                <p>"You don't look English&mdash;not at all the English style of beauty,
                    eh&mdash;Doctor?" </p>
                <p>"That's all, Miss Sackville," said Hamilton, with a scowl at the clerk. Susan and
                    he went out into Twelfth Street. Hamilton from time to time stole a glance of
                    sympathy and inquiry into the sad young face, as he and she walked eastward
                    together. "He's a strong man and sure to pull through," said the doctor. "Are
                    you alone at the hotel?" </p>
                <p>"I've nobody but him in the world," replied she. </p>
                <p>"I was about to venture to advise that you go to a boarding house," pursued the
                    young man. </p>
                <p>"Thank you. I'll see." </p>
                <p>"There's one opposite the hospital&mdash;a reasonable place." </p>
                <p>"I've got to go to work," said the girl, to herself rather than to him. </p>
                <p>"Oh, you have a position." </p>
                <p>Susan did not reply, and he assumed that she had. </p>
                <p>"If you don't mind, I'd like to call and see&mdash;Mr. Burlingham. The
                    physicians at the hospital are perfectly <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0303"
                        n="280"/> competent, as good as there are in the city. But I'm not very
                    busy, and I'd be glad to go." </p>
                <p>"We haven't any money," said the girl. "And I don't know when we shall have. I
                    don't want to deceive you." </p>
                <p>"I understand perfectly," said the young man, looking at her with interested but
                    respectful eyes. "I'm poor, myself, and have just started." </p>
                <p>"Will they treat him well, when he's got no money?" </p>
                <p>"As well as if he paid." </p>
                <p>"And you will go and see that everything's all right?" </p>
                <p>"It'll be a pleasure." </p>
                <p>Under a gas lamp he took out a card and gave it to her. She thanked him and put
                    it in the bosom of her blouse where lay all the money they had&mdash;the
                    eleven dollars and eighty cents. They walked to the hotel, as cars were few at
                    that hour. He did all the talking&mdash;assurances that her "father" could
                    not fail to get well, that typhoid wasn't anything like the serious disease it
                    used to be, and that he probably had a light form of it. The girl listened, but
                    her heart could not grow less heavy. As he was leaving her at the hotel door, he
                    hesitated, then asked if she wouldn't let him call and take her to the hospital
                    the next morning, or, rather, later that same morning. She accepted, she hoped
                    that, if he were with her, she gratefully; would be admitted to see Burlingham
                    and could assure herself that he was well taken care of. </p>
                <p>The night porter tried to detain her for a little chat. "Well," said he, "it's a
                    good hospital&mdash;for you folks with money. Of course, for us poor people
                    it's different. You couldn't hire _me_ to go there." </p>
                <p>Susan turned upon him. "Why not?" she asked. </p>
                <p>"Oh, if a man's poor, or can't pay for nice quarters, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0304" n="281"/> they treat him any old way. Yes,
                    they're good doctors and all that. But they're like everybody else. They don't
                    give a darn for poor people. But your uncle'll be all right there." </p>
                <p>For the first time in her life Susan did not close her eyes in sleep. </p>
                <p> The young doctor was so moved by her worn appearance that he impulsively said:
                    "Have you some troubles you've said nothing about? Please don't hesitate to tell
                    me." </p>
                <p>"Oh, you needn't worry about me," replied she. "I simply didn't
                    sleep&mdash;that's all. Do they treat charity patients badly at the
                    hospital?" </p>
                <p>"Certainly not," declared he earnestly. "Of course, a charity patient can't have
                    a room to himself. But that's no disadvantage." </p>
                <p>"How much is a room?" </p>
                <p>"The cheapest are ten dollars a week. That includes private
                    attendance&mdash;a little better nursing than the public patients
                    get&mdash;perhaps. But, really&mdash;Miss Sackville&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"He must have a room," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"You are sure you can afford it? The difference isn't&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"He must have a room." She held out a ten-dollar bill&mdash;ten dollars of
                    the eleven dollars and eighty cents. "This'll pay for the first week. You fix
                    it, won't you?" </p>
                <p>Young Doctor Hamilton hesitatingly took the money. "You are quite, quite sure,
                    Miss Sackville?&mdash;Quite sure you can afford this
                    extravagance&mdash;for it is an extravagance." </p>
                <p>"He must have the best we can afford," evaded she. </p>
                <p>She waited in the office while Hamilton went up. <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0305"
                        n="282"/> When he came down after perhaps half an hour, he had an air of
                    cheerfulness. "Everything going nicely," said he. </p>
                <p>Susan's violet-gray eyes gazed straight into his brown eyes; and the brown eyes
                    dropped. "You are not telling me the truth," said she. </p>
                <p>"I'm not denying he's a very sick man," protested Hamilton. </p>
                <p>"Is he&mdash;" </p>
                <p>She could not pronounce the word. </p>
                <p>"Nothing like that&mdash;believe me, nothing. He has the chances all with
                    him." </p>
                <p>And Susan tried to believe. "He will have a room?" </p>
                <p>"He has a room. That's why I was so long. And I'm glad he has&mdash;for, to
                    be perfectly honest, the attendance&mdash;not the treatment, but the
                    attendance&mdash;is much hetter for private patients." </p>
                <p>Susan was looking at the floor. Presently she drew a long breath, rose. "Well, I
                    must be going," said she. And she went to the street, he accompanying her. </p>
                <p>"If you're going back to the hotel," said he, "I'm walking that way." </p>
                <p> "No, I've got to go this way," replied she, looking up Elm Street. </p>
                <p>He saw she wished to be alone, and left her with the promise to see Burlingham
                    again that afternoon and let her know at the hotel how he was getting on. He
                    went east, she north. At the first corner she stopped, glanced back to make sure
                    he was not following. From her bosom she drew four business cards. She had taken
                    the papers from the pockets of Burlingham's clothes and from the drawer of the
                    table in his room, to put them all together for safety; she had found these
                    cards, the addresses of theatrical agents. As she looked at <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0306" n="283"/> them, she remembered Burlingham's
                    having said that Blynn&mdash;Maurice Blynn, at Vine and Ninth
                    Streets&mdash;might give them something at one of the "over the Rhine" music
                    halls, as a last resort. She noted the address, put away the cards and walked
                    on, looking about for a policeman. Soon she came to a bridge over a muddy
                    stream&mdash;a little river, she thought at first, then remembered that it
                    must be the canal&mdash;the Rhine, as it was called, because the city's huge
                    German population lived beyond it, keeping up the customs and even the language
                    of the fatherland. She stood on the bridge, watching the repulsive waters from
                    which arose the stench of sewage; watching canal boats dragged drearily by mules
                    with harness-worn hides; followed with her melancholy eyes the course of the
                    canal under bridge after bridge, through a lane of dirty, noisy factories
                    pouring out from lofty chimneys immense clouds of black smoke. It ought to have
                    been a bright summer day, but the sun shone palely through the dense clouds; a
                    sticky, sooty moisture saturated the air, formed a skin of oily black ooze over
                    everything exposed to it. A policeman, a big German, with stupid honest face,
                    brutal yet kindly, came lounging along. </p>
                <p>"I beg your pardon," said Susan, "but would you mind telling me where&mdash;"
                    she had forgotten the address, fumbled in her bosom for the cards, showed him
                    Blynn's card&mdash;"how I can get to this?" </p>
                <p>The policeman nodded as he read the address. "Keep on this way,
                    lady"&mdash;he pointed his baton south&mdash;"until you've passed four
                    streets. At the fifth street turn east. Go
                    one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash; four&mdash;five streets east.
                    Understand?" </p>
                <p>"Yes, thank you," said the girl with the politeness of deep gratitude. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0307" n="284"/>
                <p>"You'll be at Vine. You'll see the name on the street lamp. Blynn's on the
                    southwest corner. Think you can find it?" </p>
                <p>"I'm sure I can." </p>
                <p>"I'm going that way," continued the policeman. </p>
                <p>"But you'd better walk ahead. If you walked with me, they'd think you was
                    pinched&mdash;and we'd have a crowd after us." And he laughed with much
                    shaking of his fat, tightly belted body. </p>
                <p>Susan contrived to force a smile, though the suggestion of such a disgraceful
                    scene made her shudder. "Thank you so much. I'm sure I'll find it." And she
                    hastened on, eager to put distance between herself and that awkward company. </p>
                <p>"Don't mention it, lady," the policeman called after her, tapping his baton on
                    the rim of his helmet, as a mark of elegant courtesy. </p>
                <p>She was not at ease until, looking back, she no longer saw the bluecoat for the
                    intervening crowds. After several slight mistakes in the way, she descried ahead
                    of her a large sign painted on the wall of a three-story brick building: </p>
                <p> MAURICE BLYNN, THEATRICAL AGENT ALL KINDS OF TALENT PLACED AND SUPPLIED </p>
                <p> After some investigation she discovered back of the saloon which occupied the
                    street floor a grimy and uneven wooden staircase leading to the upper stories.
                    At the first floor she came face to face with a door on the glass of which was
                    painted the same announcement she had read from the wall. She knocked timidly,
                    then louder. A shrill voice came from the interior: </p>
                <p>"The door's open. Come in." </p>
                <p>She turned the knob and entered a small, low-ceilinged <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0308" n="285"/> room whose general grime was streaked
                    here and there with smears of soot. It contained a small wooden table at which
                    sprawled a freckled and undernourished office boy, and a wooden bench where
                    fretted a woman obviously of "the profession." She was dressed in masses of
                    dirty white furbelows. On her head reared a big hat, above an incredible
                    quantity of yellow hair; on the hat were badly put together plumes of badly
                    curled ostrich feathers. Beneath her skirt was visible one of her feet; it was
                    large and fat, was thrust into a tiny slipper with high heel ending under the
                    arch of the foot. The face of the actress was young and pertly pretty, but worn,
                    overpainted, overpowdered and underwashed. She eyed Susan insolently. </p>
                <p>"Want to see the boss?" said the boy. </p>
                <p>"If you please," murmured Susan. </p>
                <p>"Business?" </p>
                <p>"I'm looking for a&mdash;for a place." </p>
                <p>The boy examined her carefully. "Appointment?" </p>
                <p>"No, sir," replied the girl. </p>
                <p>"Well&mdash;he'll see you, anyhow," said the boy, rising. </p>
                <p>The mass of plumes and yellow bangs and furbelows on the bench became violently
                    agitated. "I'm first," cried the actress. </p>
                <p>"Oh, you sit tight, Mame," jeered the boy. He opened a solid door behind him.
                    Through the crack Susan saw busily writing at a table desk a bald, fat man with
                    a pasty skin and a veined and bulbous nose. </p>
                <p>"Lady to see you," said the boy in a tone loud enough for both Susan and the
                    actress to hear. </p>
                <p>"Who? What name?" snapped the man, not ceasing or looking up. </p>
                <p>"She's young, and a queen," said the boy. "Shall I show her in?" </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0309" n="286"/>

                <p>"Yep." </p>
                <p>The actress started up. "Mr. Blynn&mdash;" she began in a loud, threatening,
                    elocutionary voice. </p>
                <p>"'Lo, Mame," said Blynn, still busy. "No time to see you. Nothing doing. So
                    long." </p>
                <p>"But, Mr. Blynn&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Bite it off, Mame," ordered the boy. "Walk in, miss." </p>
                <p>Susan, deeply colored from sympathy with the humiliated actress and from
                    nervousness in those forbidding and ominous surroundings, entered the private
                    office. The boy closed the door behind her. The pen scratched on. Presently the
                    man said: </p>
                <p>"Well, my dear, what's your name?" </p>
                <p>With the last word, the face lifted and Susan saw a seamed and pitted skin, small
                    pale blue eyes showing the white, or rather the bloodshot yellow all round the
                    iris, a heavy mouth and jaw, thick lips; the lower lip protruded and was
                    decorated with a blue-black spot like a blood boil, as if to indicate where the
                    incessant cigar usually rested. At first glance into Susan's sweet, young face
                    the small eyes sparkled and danced, traveled on to the curves of her form. </p>
                <p>"Do sit down, my dear," said he in a grotesquely wheedling voice. She took the
                    chair close to him as it was the only one in the little room. </p>
                <p>"What can I do for you? My, how fresh and pretty you are!" </p>
                <p>"Mr. Burlingham&mdash;" began Susan. </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;you're the girl Bob was talking about." He smiled and nodded at
                    her. "No wonder he kept you out of sight." He inventoried her charms again with
                    his sensual, confident glance. "Bob certainly has got good taste." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0310" n="287"/>
                <p>"He's in the hospital," said Susan desperately. "So I've come to get a place if
                    you can find me one." </p>
                <p>"Hospital? I'm sorry to hear that." And Mr. Blynn's tones had that accent of deep
                    sympathy which get a man or woman without further evidence credit for being
                    "kind-hearted whatever else he is." </p>
                <p>"Yes, he's very ill&mdash;with typhoid," said the girl. "I must do something
                    right away to help him." </p>
                <p>"That's fine&mdash;fine," said Mr. Blynn in the same effective tone. "I see
                    you're as sweet as you are pretty. Yes&mdash;that's fine&mdash;fine!"
                    And the moisture was in the little eyes. "Well, I think I can do something for
                    you. I _must_ do something for you. Had much experience?&mdash;Professional,
                    I mean." </p>
                <p>Mr. Blynn laughed at his, to Susan, mysterious joke. Susan smiled faintly in
                    polite response. He rubbed his hands and smacked his lips, the small eyes
                    dancing. The moisture had vanished. </p>
                <p>"Oh, yes, I can place you, if you can do anything at all," he went on. "I'd 'a'
                    done it long ago, if Bob had let me see you. But he was too foxy. He ought to be
                    ashamed of himself, standing in the way of your getting on, just out of
                    jealousy. Sing or dance&mdash;or both?" </p>
                <p>"I can sing a little, I think," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"Now, that's modest. Ever worn tights?" </p>
                <p>Susan shook her head, a piteous look in her violet-gray eyes. </p>
                <p>"Oh, you'll soon get used to that. And mighty well you'll look in 'em, I'll bet,
                    eh? Where did Bob get you? And when?" Before she could answer, he went on,
                    "Let's see, I've got a date for this evening, but I'll put it off. And she's a
                    peach, too. So you see what a hit you've made with me. We'll have a nice <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0311" n="288"/> little dinner at the Hotel du Rhine
                    and talk things over." </p>
                <p>"Couldn't I go to work right away?" asked the girl. </p>
                <p>"Sure. I'll have you put on at Schaumer's tomorrow night&mdash;" He looked
                    shrewdly, laughingly, at her, with contracted eyelids. "_If_ everything goes
                    well. Before I do anything for you, I have to see what you can do for me." And
                    he nodded and smacked his lips. "Oh, we'll have a lovely little dinner!" He
                    looked expectantly at her. "You certainly are a queen! What a dainty little
                    hand!" He reached out one of his hands&mdash;puffy as if it had been
                    poisoned, very white, with stubby fingers. Susan reluctantly yielded her hand to
                    his close, mushy embrace. "No rings. That's a shame, petty&mdash;" He was
                    talking as if to a baby.&mdash;"That'll have to be fixed&mdash;yes, it
                    will, my little sweetie. My, how nice and fresh you are!" And his great
                    nostrils, repulsively hairy within, deeply pitted without, sniffed as if over an
                    odorous flower. </p>
                <p>Susan drew her hand away. "What will they give me?" she asked. </p>
                <p>"How greedy it is!" he wheedled. "Well, you'll get plenty&mdash;plenty." </p>
                <p>"How much?" said the girl. "Is it a salary?" </p>
                <p>"Of course, there's the regular salary. But that won't amount to much. You know
                    how those things are." </p>
                <p>"How much?" </p>
                <p>"Oh, say a dollar a night&mdash;until you make a hit." </p>
                <p>"Six dollars a week." </p>
                <p>"Seven. This is a Sunday town. Sunday's the big day. You'll have Wednesday,
                    Saturday and Sunday matinees, but they don't pay for them." </p>
                <p>"Seven dollars a week." And the hospital wanted <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0312"
                        n="289"/> ten. "Couldn't I get&mdash;about fifteen&mdash;or
                    fourteen? I think I could do on fourteen." </p>
                <p>"Rather! I was talking only of the salary. You'll make a good many times
                    fifteen&mdash;if you play your cards right. It's true Schaumer draws only a
                    beer crowd. But as soon as the word flies round that _you_'re there, the boys
                    with the boodle'll flock in. Oh, you'll wear the sparklers all right, pet." </p>
                <p>Rather slowly it was penetrating to Susan what Mr. Blynn had in mind.
                    "I'd&mdash;I'd rather take a regular salary," said she. "I must have ten a
                    week for him. I can live any old way." </p>
                <p>"Oh, come off!" cried Mr. Blynn with a wink. "What's your game? Anyhow, don't
                    play it on me. You understand that you can't get something for nothing. It's all
                    very well to love your friend and be true to him. But he can't
                    expect&mdash;he'll not ask you to queer yourself. That sort of thing don't
                    go in the profession. . . . Come now, I'm willing to set you on your feet, give
                    you a good start, if you'll play fair with me&mdash;show appreciation. Will
                    you or won't you?" </p>
                <p>"You mean&mdash;" began Susan, and paused there, looking at him with grave
                    questioning eyes. </p>
                <p>His own eyes shifted. "Yes, I mean that. I'm a business man, not a
                    sentimentalist. I don't want love. I've got no time for it. But when it comes to
                    giving a girl of the right sort a square deal and a good time, why you'll find
                    I'm as good as there is going." He reached for her hands again, his empty,
                    flabby chin bags quivering. "I want to help Bob, and I want to help you." </p>
                <p>She rose slowly, pushing her chair back. She understood now why Burlingham had
                    kept her in the background, why his quest had been vain, why it had fretted <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0313" n="290"/> him into mortal illness.
                    "I&mdash;couldn't do that," she said. "I'm sorry, but I couldn't." </p>
                <p>He looked at her in a puzzled way. "You belong to Bob, don't you?" </p>
                <p>"No." </p>
                <p>"You mean you're straight&mdash;a good girl?" </p>
                <p>"Yes." </p>
                <p>He was half inclined to believe her, so impressive was her quiet natural way, in
                    favorable contrast to the noisy protests of women posing as virtuous.
                    "Well&mdash;if that's so&mdash;why you'd better drop out of the
                    profession&mdash;and get away from Bob Burlingham." </p>
                <p>"Can't I have a place without&mdash;what you said?" </p>
                <p>"Not as pretty a girl as you. And if they ain't pretty the public don't want
                    'em." </p>
                <p>Susan went to the door leading into the office. "No&mdash;the other door,"
                    said Blynn hastily. He did not wish the office boy to read his defeat in Susan's
                    countenance. He got up himself, opened the door into the hall. Susan passed out.
                    "Think it over," said he, eyes and mouth full of longing. "Come round in a day
                    or two, and we'll have another talk." </p>
                <p>"Thank you," said Susan. She felt no anger against him. She felt about him as she
                    had about Jeb Ferguson. It was not his fault; it was simply the way life was
                    lived&mdash;part of the general misery and horror of the established
                    order&mdash;like marriage and the rest of it. </p>
                <p>"I'll treat you white," urged Blynn, tenderly. "I've got a soft
                    heart&mdash;that's why I'll never get rich. Any of the others'd ask more and
                    give less." </p>
                <p>She looked at him with an expression that haunted him for several hours. "Thank
                    you. Good-by," she said, and went down the narrow, rickety stairs&mdash;and
                    out into the confused maze of streets full of strangers. </p>

                <p> AT the hotel again; she went to Burlingham's room, gathered his
                    belongings&mdash;his suit, his well-worn, twice-tapped shoes, his one extra
                    suit of underclothes, a soiled shirt, two dickeys and cuffs, his whisk broom,
                    toothbrush, a box of blacking, the blacking brush. She made the package as
                    compact as she could&mdash;it was still a formidable bundle both for size
                    and weight&mdash;and carried it into her room. Then she rolled into a small
                    parcel her own possessions&mdash;two blouses, an undervest, a pair of
                    stockings, a nightgown&mdash;reminder of Bethlehem and her brief sip at the
                    cup of success&mdash;a few toilet articles. With the two bundles she
                    descended to the office. </p>
                <p>"I came to say," she said calmly to the clerk, "that we have no money to pay what
                    we owe. Mr. Burlingham is at the hospital&mdash;very sick with typhoid. Here
                    is a dollar and eighty cents. You can have that, but I'd like to keep it, as
                    it's all we've got." </p>
                <p>The clerk called the manager, and to him Susan repeated. She used almost the same
                    words; she spoke in the same calm, monotonous way. When she finished, the
                    manager, a small, brisk man with a large brisk beard, said: </p>
                <p>"No. Keep the money. I'd like to ask you to stay on. But we run this place for a
                    class of people who haven't much at best and keep wobbling back and forth across
                    the line. If I broke my rule&mdash;" </p>
                <p>He made a furious gesture, looked at the girl angrily&mdash;holding her
                    responsible for his being in a <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0315" n="292"/>position where he must do violence to every
                    decent instinct&mdash;"My God, miss, I've got a wife and children to look
                    after. If I ran my hotel on sympathy, what'd become of them?" </p>
                <p>"I wouldn't take anything I couldn't pay for," said Susan. "As soon as I earn
                    some money&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Don't worry about that," interrupted the manager. He saw now that he was dealing
                    with one who would in no circumstances become troublesome; he went on in an
                    easier tone: "You can stay till the house fills up." </p>
                <p>"Could you give me a place to wait on table and clean up rooms&mdash;or help
                    cook?" </p>
                <p>"No, I don't need anybody. The town's full of people out of work. You can't ask
                    me to turn away&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Please&mdash;I didn't know," cried the girl. </p>
                <p>"Anyhow, I couldn't give but twelve a month and board," continued the manager.
                    "And the work&mdash;for a lady like you&mdash;" </p>
                <p>A lady! She dropped her gaze in confusion. If he knew about her birth! </p>
                <p>"I'll do anything. I'm not a lady," said she. "But I've got to have at least ten
                    a week in cash." </p>
                <p>"No such place here." The manager was glad to find the fault of uppish ideas in
                    this girl who was making it hard for him to be businesslike. "No such place
                    anywhere for a beginner." </p>
                <p>"I must have it," said the girl. </p>
                <p>"I don't want to discourage you, but&mdash;" He was speaking less curtly, for
                    her expression made him suspect why she was bent upon that particular amount. "I
                    hope you'll succeed. Only&mdash;don't be depressed if you're disappointed." </p>
                <p>She smiled gravely at him; he bowed, avoiding her eyes. She took up her bundles
                    and went out into Walnut <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0316" n="293"/> Street. He
                    moved a few steps in obedience to an impulse to follow her, to give her counsel
                    and warning, to offer to help her about the larger bundle. But he checked
                    himself with the frown of his own not too prosperous affairs. </p>
                <p>It was the hottest part of the day, and her way lay along unshaded streets. As
                    she had eaten nothing since the night before, she felt faint. Her face was
                    ghastly when she entered the office of the hospital and left Burlingham's
                    parcel. The clerk at the desk told her that Burlingham was in the same
                    condition&mdash;"and there'll be probably no change one way or the other for
                    several days." </p>
                <p>She returned to the street, wandered aimlessly about. She knew she ought to eat
                    something, but the idea of food revolted her. She was fighting the temptation to
                    go to the _Commercial_ office, Roderick Spenser's office. She had not a
                    suspicion that his kindness might have been impulse, long since repented of,
                    perhaps repented of as soon as he was away from her. She felt that if she went
                    to him he would help her. "But I mustn't do it," she said to herself. "Not after
                    what I did." No, she must not see him until she could pay him back. Also, and
                    deeper, there was a feeling that there was a curse upon her; had not everyone
                    who befriended her come to grief? She must not draw anyone else into trouble,
                    must not tangle others in the meshes of her misfortunes. She did not reason this
                    out, of course; but the feeling was not the less strong because the reasons for
                    it were vague in her mind. And there was nothing vague about the resolve to
                    which she finally came&mdash;that she would fight her battle herself. </p>
                <p>Her unheeding wanderings led her after an hour or so to a big department store.
                    Crowds of shoppers, <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0317" n="294"/> mussy, hot, and
                    cross, were pushing rudely in and out of the doors. She entered, approached a
                    well-dressed, bareheaded old gentleman, whom she rightly placed as floorwalker,
                    inquired of him: </p>
                <p>"Where do they ask for work?" </p>
                <p>She had been attracted to him because his was the one face within view not
                    suggesting temper or at least bad humor. It was more than pleasant, it was
                    benign. He inclined toward Susan with an air that invited confidence and
                    application for balm for a wounded spirit. The instant the nature of her inquiry
                    penetrated through his pose to the man himself, there was a swift change to
                    lofty disdain&mdash;the familiar attitude of workers toward fellow-workers
                    of what they regard as a lower class. Evidently he resented her having beguiled
                    him by the false air of young lady into wasting upon her, mere servility like
                    himself, a display reserved exclusively for patrons. It was Susan's first
                    experience of this snobbishness; it at once humbled her into the dust. She had
                    been put in her place, and that place was not among people worthy of civil
                    treatment. A girl of his own class would have flashed at him, probably would
                    have "jawed" him. Susan meekly submitted; she was once more reminded that she
                    was an outcast, one for whom the respectable world had no place. He made some
                    sort of reply to her question, in the tone the usher of a fashionable church
                    would use to a stranger obviously not in the same set as the habitues. She heard
                    the tone, but not the words; she turned away to seek the street again. She
                    wandered on&mdash;through the labyrinth of streets, through the crowds on
                    crowds of strangers. </p>
                <p>Ten dollars a week! She knew little about wages, but enough to realize the
                    hopelessness of her quest. <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0318" n="295"/> Ten
                    dollars a week&mdash;and her own keep beside. The faces of the crowds
                    pushing past her and jostling her made her heartsick. So much sickness, and
                    harassment, and discontent&mdash;so much unhappiness! Surely all these sad
                    hearts ought to be kind to each other. Yet they were not; each soul went
                    selfishly alone, thinking only of its own burden. </p>
                <p>She walked on and on, thinking, in this disconnected way characteristic of a good
                    intelligence that has not yet developed order and sequence, a theory of life and
                    a purpose. It had always been her habit to walk about rather than to sit,
                    whether indoors or out. She could think better when in motion physically. When
                    she was so tired that she began to feel weak, she saw a shaded square, with
                    benches under the trees. She entered, sat down to rest. She might apply to the
                    young doctor. But, no. He was poor&mdash;and what chance was there of her
                    ever making the money to pay back? No, she could not take alms; than alms there
                    was no lower way of getting money. She might return to Mr. Blynn and accept his
                    offer. The man in all his physical horror rose before her. No, she could not do
                    that. At least, not yet. She could entertain the idea as a possibility now. She
                    remembered her wedding&mdash;the afternoon, the night. Yes, Blynn's offer
                    involved nothing so horrible as that&mdash;and she had lived through that.
                    It would be cowardice, treachery, to shrink from anything that should prove
                    necessary in doing the square thing by the man who had done so much for her. She
                    had said she would die for Burlingham; she owed even that to him, if her death
                    would help him. Had she then meant nothing but mere lying words of pretended
                    gratitude? But Blynn was always there; something else might turn up, and her
                    dollar and eighty cents would last another <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0319"
                        n="296"/> day or so, and the ten dollars were not due for six days. No, she
                    would not go to Blynn; she would wait, would take his advice&mdash;"think it
                    over." </p>
                <p>A man was walking up and down the shaded alley, passing and repassing the bench
                    where she sat. She observed him, saw that he was watching her. He was a young
                    man&mdash;a very young man&mdash;of middle height, strongly built. He
                    had crisp, short dark hair, a darkish skin, amiable blue-gray eyes, pleasing
                    features. She decided that he was of good family, was home from some college on
                    vacation. He was wearing a silk shirt, striped flannel trousers, a thin serge
                    coat of an attractive shade of blue. She liked his looks, liked the way he
                    dressed. It pleased her that such a man should be interested in her; he had a
                    frank and friendly air, and her sad young heart was horribly lonely. She
                    pretended not to notice him; but after a while he walked up to her, lifting his
                    straw hat. </p>
                <p>"Good afternoon," said he. When he showed his strong sharp teeth in an amiable
                    smile, she thought of Sam Wright&mdash;only this man was not weak and mean
                    looking, like her last and truest memory picture of Sam&mdash;indeed, the
                    only one she had not lost. "Good afternoon," replied she politely. For in spite
                    of Burlingham's explanations and cautionings she was still the small-town girl,
                    unsuspicious toward courtesy from strange men. Also, she longed for someone to
                    talk with. It had been weeks since she had talked with anyone nearer than
                    Burlingham to her own age and breeding. </p>
                <p>"Won't you have lunch with me?" he asked. "I hate to eat alone." </p>
                <p>She, faint from hunger, simply could not help obvious hesitation before saying,
                    "I don't think I care for any." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0320" n="297"/>
                <p>"You haven't had yours&mdash;have you?" </p>
                <p>"No." </p>
                <p>"May I sit down?" </p>
                <p>She moved along the bench to indicate that he might, without definitely
                    committing herself. </p>
                <p>He sat, took off his hat. He had a clean, fresh look about the neck that pleased
                    her. She was weary of seeing grimy, sweaty people, and of smelling them. Also,
                    except the young doctor, since Roderick Spenser left her at Carrolltown she had
                    talked with no one of her own age and class&mdash;the class in which she had
                    been brought up, the class that, after making her one of itself, had cast her
                    out forever with its mark of shame upon her. Its mark of shame&mdash;burning
                    and stinging again as she sat beside this young man! </p>
                <p>"You're sad about something?" suggested he, himself nearly as embarrassed as she. </p>
                <p>"My friend's ill. He's got typhoid." </p>
                <p>"That is bad. But he'll get all right. They always cure typhoid,
                    nowadays&mdash;if it's taken in time and the nursing's good. Everything
                    depends on the nursing. I had it a couple of years ago, and pulled through
                    easily." </p>
                <p>Susan brightened. He spoke so confidently that the appeal to her young credulity
                    toward good news and the hopeful, cheerful thing was irresistible. "Oh,
                    yes&mdash;he'll be over it soon," the young man went on, "especially if he's
                    in a hospital where they've got the facilities for taking care of sick people.
                    Where is he?" </p>
                <p>"In the hospital&mdash;up that way." She moved her head vaguely in the
                    direction of the northwest. </p>
                <p>"Oh, yes. It's a good one&mdash;for the pay patients. I suppose for the poor
                    devils that can't pay"&mdash;he glanced with careless sympathy at the dozen
                    or so <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0321" n="298"/> tramps on benches
                    nearby&mdash;"it's like all the rest of 'em&mdash;like the whole world,
                    for that matter. It must be awful not to have money enough to get on with, I
                    mean. I'm talking about men." He smiled cheerfully. "With a woman&mdash;if
                    she's pretty&mdash;it's different, of course." </p>
                <p>The girl was so agitated that she did not notice the sly, if shy, hint in the
                    remark and its accompanying glance. Said she: </p>
                <p>"But it's a good hospital if you pay?" </p>
                <p>"None better. Maybe it's good straight through. I've only heard the servants'
                    talk&mdash;and servants are such liars. Still&mdash;I'd not want to
                    trust myself to a hospital unless I could pay. I guess the common people have
                    good reason for their horror of free wards. Nothing free is ever good." </p>
                <p>The girl's face suddenly and startlingly grew almost hard, so fierce was the
                    resolve that formed within her. The money must be
                    got&mdash;_must!_&mdash;and would. She would try every way she could
                    think of between now and to-morrow; then&mdash;if she failed she would go to
                    Blynn. </p>
                <p>The young man was saying: "You're a stranger in town?" </p>
                <p>"I was with a theatrical company on a show boat. It sank." </p>
                <p>His embarrassment vanished. She saw, but she did not understand that it was
                    because he thought he had "placed" her&mdash;and that her place was where he
                    had hoped. </p>
                <p>"You _are_ up against it!" said he. "Come have some lunch. You'll feel better." </p>
                <p>The good sense of this was unanswerable. Susan hesitated no longer, wondered why
                    she had hesitated at <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0322" n="299"/> first.
                    "Well&mdash;I guess I will." And she rose with a frank, childlike alacrity
                    that amused him immensely. </p>
                <p>"You don't look it, but you've been about some&mdash;haven't you?" </p>
                <p>"Rather," replied she. </p>
                <p>"I somehow thought you knew a thing or two." </p>
                <p>They walked west to Race Street. They were about the same height. Her costume
                    might have been fresher, might have suggested to an expert eye the passed-on
                    clothes of a richer relative; but her carriage and the fine look of skin and
                    hair and features made the defects of dress unimportant. She seemed of his
                    class&mdash;of the class comfortable, well educated, and well-bred. If she
                    had been more experienced, she would have seen that he was satisfied with her
                    appearance despite the curious looking little package, and would have been
                    flattered. As it was, her interest was absorbed in things apart from herself. He
                    talked about the town&mdash;the amusements, the good times to be had at the
                    over-the-Rhine beer halls, at the hilltop gardens, at the dances in the pavilion
                    out at the Zoo. He drew a lively and charming picture, one that appealed to her
                    healthy youth, to her unsatisfied curiosity, to her passionate desire to live
                    the gay, free city life of which the small town reads and dreams. </p>
                <p>"You and I can go round together, can't we? I haven't got much, but I'll not try
                    to take your time for nothing, of course. That wouldn't be square. I'm sure
                    you'll have no cause to complain. What do you say?" </p>
                <p>"Maybe," replied the girl, all at once absentminded. Her brain was wildly busy
                    with some ideas started there by his significant words, by his flirtatious
                    glances at her, by his way of touching her whenever he could <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0323" n="300"/> make opportunity. Evidently there was
                    an alternative to Blynn. </p>
                <p>"You like a good time, don't you?" said he. </p>
                <p>"Rather!" exclaimed she, the violet eyes suddenly very violet indeed and
                    sparkling. Her spirits had suddenly soared. She was acting like one of her age.
                    With that blessed happy hopefulness of healthy youth, she had put aside her
                    sorrows&mdash;not because she was frivolous but for the best of all reasons,
                    because she was young and superbly vital. Said she: "I'm crazy about
                    dancing&mdash;and music." </p>
                <p>"I only needed to look at your feet&mdash;and ankles&mdash;to know that,"
                    ventured he the "ankles" being especially audacious. </p>
                <p>She was pleased, and in youth's foolish way tried to hide her pleasure by saying,
                    "My feet aren't exactly small." </p>
                <p>"I should say not!" protested he with energy. "Little feet would look like the
                    mischief on a girl as tall as you are. Yes, we can have a lot of fun." </p>
                <p>They went into a large restaurant with fly fans speeding. Susan thought it very
                    grand&mdash;and it was the grandest restaurant she had ever been in. They
                    sat down&mdash;in a delightfully cool place by a window looking out on a
                    little plot of green with a colladium, a fountain, some oleanders in full and
                    fragrant bloom; the young man ordered, with an ease that fascinated her, an
                    elaborate lunch&mdash;soup, a chicken, with salad, ice cream, and fresh
                    peaches. Susan had a menu in her hand and as he ordered she noted the prices.
                    She was dazzled by his extravagance&mdash;dazzled and
                    frightened&mdash;and, in a curious, vague, unnerving way, fascinated.
                    Money&mdash;the thing she must have for Burlingham in whose case "everything
                    depended on the nursing." In <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0324" n="301"/> the
                    brief time this boy and she had been together, he, without making an effort to
                    impress, had given her the feeling that he was of the best city class, that he
                    knew the world&mdash;the high world. Thus, she felt that she must be careful
                    not to show her "greenness." She would have liked to protest against his
                    extravagance, but she ventured only the timid remonstrance, "Oh, I'm not a bit
                    hungry." </p>
                <p>She thought she was speaking the truth, for the ideas whirling so fast that they
                    were dim quite took away the sense of hunger. But when the food came she
                    discovered that she was, on the contrary, ravenous&mdash;and she ate with
                    rising spirits, with a feeling of content and hope. He had urged her to drink
                    wine or beer, but she refused to take anything but a glass of milk; and he ended
                    by taking milk himself. He was looking more and more boldly and ardently into
                    her eyes, and she received his glances smilingly. She felt thoroughly at ease
                    and at home, as if she were back once more among her own sort of
                    people&mdash;with some element of disagreeable constraint left out. </p>
                <p>Since she was an outcast, she need not bother about the small restraints the
                    girls felt compelled to put upon themselves in the company of boys. Nobody
                    respected a "bastard," as they called her when they spoke frankly. So with
                    nothing to lose she could at least get what pleasure there was in freedom. She
                    liked it, having this handsome, well-dressed young man making love to her in
                    this grand restaurant where things were so good to eat and so excitingly
                    expensive. He would not regard her as fit to associate with his respectable
                    mother and sisters. In the casts of respectability, her place was with Jeb
                    Ferguson! She was better off, clear of the whole unjust and horrible business of
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0325" n="302"/> respectable life, clear of it and
                    free, frankly in the outcast class. She had not realized&mdash;and she did
                    not realize&mdash;that association with the players of the show boat had
                    made any especial change in her; in fact, it had loosened to the sloughing point
                    the whole skin of her conventional training&mdash;that surface skin which
                    seems part of the very essence of our being until something happens to force us
                    to shed it. Crises, catastrophes, may scratch that skin, or cut clear through
                    it; but only the gentle, steady, everywhere-acting prying-loose of day and night
                    association can change it from a skin to a loose envelope ready to be shed at
                    any moment. </p>
                <p>"What are you going to do?" asked the young man, when the acquaintance had become
                    a friendship&mdash;which was before the peaches and ice cream were served. </p>
                <p>"I don't, know " said the girl, with the secretive instinct of self-reliance
                    hiding the unhappiness his abrupt question set to throbbing again. </p>
                <p>"Honestly, I've never met anyone that was so congenial. But maybe you don't feel
                    that way?" </p>
                <p>"Then again maybe I do," rejoined she, forcing a merry smile. </p>
                <p>His face flushed with embarrassment, but his eyes grew more ardent as he said:
                    "What were you looking for, when I saw you in Garfield Place?" </p>
                <p>"Was that Garfield Place?" she asked, in evasion. </p>
                <p>"Yes." And he insisted, "What were you looking for?" </p>
                <p>"What were _you_ looking for?" </p>
                <p>"For a pretty girl." They both laughed. "And I've found her. I'm suited if you
                    are. . . . Don't look so serious. You haven't answered my question." </p>
                <p>"I'm looking for work." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0326" n="303"/>
                <p>He smiled as if it were a joke. "You mean for a place on the stage. That isn't
                    work. _You_ couldn't work. I can see that at a glance." </p>
                <p>"Why not?" </p>
                <p>"Oh, you haven't been brought up to that kind of life. You'd hate it in every
                    way. And they don't pay women anything for work. My father employs a lot of
                    them. Most of his girls live at home. That keeps the wages down, and the others
                    have to piece out with"&mdash;he smiled&mdash;"one thing and another." </p>
                <p>Susan sat gazing straight before her. "I've not had much experience," she finally
                    said, thoughtfully. "I guess I don't know what I'm about." </p>
                <p>The young man leaned toward her, his face flushing with earnestness. "You don't
                    know how pretty you are. I wish my father wasn't so close with me. I'd not let
                    you ever speak of work again&mdash;even on the stage. What good times we
                    could have!" </p>
                <p>"I must be going," said she, rising. Her whole body was alternately hot and cold.
                    In her brain, less vague now, were the ideas Mabel Connemora had opened up for
                    her. </p>
                <p>"Oh, bother!" exclaimed he. "Sit down a minute. You misunderstood me. I don't
                    mean I'm flat broke." </p>
                <p>Susan hastily reseated herself, showing her confusion. "I wasn't thinking of
                    that." </p>
                <p>"Then&mdash;what were you thinking of?" </p>
                <p>"I don't know," she replied&mdash;truthfully, for she could not have put into
                    words anything definite about the struggle raging in her like a battle in a fog.
                    "I often don't exactly know what I'm thinking about. I somehow
                    can't&mdash;can't fit it together&mdash;yet." </p>
                <p>"Do you suppose," he went on, as if she had not spoken, "do you suppose I don't
                    understand? I know <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0327" n="304"/> you can't afford
                    to let me take your time for nothing. . . . Don't you like me a little?" </p>
                <p>She looked at him with grave friendliness. "Yes." Then, seized with a terror
                    which her habitual manner of calm concealed from him, she rose again. </p>
                <p>"Why shouldn't it be me as well as another?. . . At least sit down till I pay the
                    bill." </p>
                <p>She seated herself, stared at her plate. </p>
                <p>"Now what are you thinking about?" he asked. </p>
                <p>"I don't know exactly. Nothing much." </p>
                <p>The waiter brought the bill. The young man merely glanced at the total, drew a
                    small roll of money from his trousers pocket, put a five-dollar note on the tray
                    with the bill. Susan's eyes opened wide when the waiter returned with only two
                    quarters and a dime. She glanced furtively at the young man, to see if he, too,
                    was not disconcerted. He waved the tray carelessly aside; the waiter said "Thank
                    you," in a matter-of-course way, dropped the sixty cents into his pocket. The
                    waiter's tip was by itself almost as much as she had ever seen paid out for a
                    meal for two persons. </p>
                <p>"Now, where shall we go?" asked the young man. </p>
                <p>Susan did not lift her eyes. He leaned toward her, took her hand. "You're
                    different from the sort a fellow usually finds," said he. "And I'm&mdash;I'm
                    crazy about you. Let's go," said he. </p>
                <p>Susan took her bundle, followed him. She glanced up the street and down. She had
                    an impulse to say she must go away alone; it was not strong enough to frame a
                    sentence, much less express her thought. She was seeing queer, vivid, apparently
                    disconnected visions&mdash;Burlingham, sick unto death, on the stretcher in
                    the hospital reception room&mdash;Blynn of the hideous face and loose,
                    repulsive body&mdash;the contemptuous old gentleman <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0328" n="305"/> in the shop&mdash;odds and ends
                    of the things Mabel Connemora had told her&mdash;the roll of bills the young
                    man had taken from his pocket when he paid&mdash;Jeb Ferguson in the climax
                    of the horrors of that wedding day and night. They went to Garfield Place,
                    turned west, paused after a block or so at a little frame house set somewhat
                    back from the street. The young man, who had been as silent as she&mdash;but
                    nervous instead of preoccupied&mdash;opened the gate in the picket fence. </p>
                <p>"This is a first-class quiet place," said he, embarrassed but trying to appear at
                    ease. </p>
                <p>Susan hesitated. She must somehow nerve herself to speak of money, to say to him
                    that she needed ten dollars&mdash;that she must have it. If she did not
                    speak&mdash;if she got nothing for Mr. Burlingham&mdash;or almost
                    nothing&mdash;and probably men didn't give women much&mdash;if she were
                    going with him&mdash;to endure again the horrors and the degradation she had
                    suffered from Mr. Ferguson&mdash;if it should be in vain! This nice young
                    man didn't suggest Mr. Ferguson in any way. But there was such a mystery about
                    men&mdash;they had a way of changing so&mdash;Sam Wright&mdash;Uncle
                    George even Mr. Ferguson hadn't seemed capable of torturing a helpless girl for
                    no reason at all&mdash; </p>
                <p>"We can't stand here," the young man was saying. </p>
                <p>She tried to speak about the ten dollars. She simply could not force out the
                    words. With brain in a whirl, with blood beating suffocatingly into her throat
                    and lungs, but giving no outward sign of agitation, she entered the gate. There
                    was a low, old-fashioned porch along the side of the house, with an awning
                    curiously placed at the end toward the street. When they ascended the steps
                    under the awning, they were screened from the street. The young man pulled a
                    knob. A bell <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0329" n="306"/> within tinkled faintly;
                    Susan started, shivered. But the young man, looking straight at the door, did
                    not see. A colored girl with a pleasant, welcoming face opened, stood aside for
                    them to enter. He went straight up the stairs directly ahead, and Susan
                    followed. At the threshold the trembling girl looked round in terror. She
                    expected to see a place like that foul, close little farm bedroom&mdash;for
                    it seemed to her that at such times men must seek some dreadful
                    place&mdash;vile, dim, fitting. She was in a small, attractively furnished
                    room, with a bow window looking upon the yard and the street. The furniture
                    reminded her of her own room at her uncle's in Sutherland, except that the brass
                    bed was far finer. He closed the door and locked it. </p>
                <p>As he advanced toward her he said: "_What_ are you seeing? Please don't look like
                    that." Persuasively, "You weren't thinking of me&mdash;were you?" </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;Oh, no," replied she, passing her hand over her eyes to try to
                    drive away the vision of Ferguson. </p>
                <p>"You look as if you expected to be murdered. Do you want to go?" </p>
                <p>She forced herself to seem calm. "What a coward I am!" she said to herself. "If I
                    could only die for him, instead of this. But I can't. And I _must_ get money for
                    him." </p>
                <p>To the young man she said: "No. I&mdash;I&mdash;want to stay." </p>
                <p> Late in the afternoon, when they were once more in the street, he said. "I'd ask
                    you to go to dinner with me, but I haven't enough money." </p>
                <p>She stopped short. An awful look came into her face. </p>
                <p>"Don't be alarmed," cried he, hurried and nervous, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0330" n="307"/> and blushing furiously. "I put
                    the&mdash;the present for you in that funny little bundle of yours, under
                    one of the folds of the nightgown or whatever it is you've got wrapped on the
                    outside. I didn't like to hand it to you. I've a feeling somehow that you're not
                    regularly&mdash;that kind." </p>
                <p>"Was it&mdash;ten dollars?" she said, and for all he could see she was
                    absolutely calm. </p>
                <p>"Yes," replied he, with a look of relief followed by a smile of amused
                    tenderness. </p>
                <p>"I can't make you out," he went on. "You're a queer one. You've had a look in
                    your eyes all afternoon&mdash;well, if I hadn't been sure you were
                    experienced, you'd almost have frightened me away." </p>
                <p>"Yes, I've had experience. The&mdash;the worst," said the girl. </p>
                <p>"You&mdash;you attract me awfully; you've got&mdash;well, everything
                    that's nice about a woman&mdash;and at the same time, there's something in
                    your eyes&mdash;Are you very fond of your friend?" </p>
                <p>"He's all I've got in the world." </p>
                <p>"I suppose it's his being sick that makes you look and act so queer?" </p>
                <p>"I don't know what's the matter with me," she said slowly. "I&mdash;don't
                    know." </p>
                <p>"I want to see you again&mdash;soon. What's your address?" </p>
                <p>"I haven't any. I've got to look for a place to live." </p>
                <p>"Well, you can give me the place you did live. I'll write you there, Lorna. You
                    didn't ask me my name when I asked you yours. You've hardly said anything. Are
                    you always quiet like this?" </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;not always. At Least, I haven't been." </p>
                <p>"No. You weren't, part of the time this afternoon <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0331" n="308"/> &mdash;at the restaurant. Tell
                    me, what are you thinking about all the time? You're very secretive. Why don't
                    you tell me? Don't you know I like you?" </p>
                <p>"I don't know," said the girl in a slow dazed way.
                    "I&mdash;don't&mdash;know." </p>
                <p>"I wouldn't take your time for nothing," he went on, after a pause. "My father
                    doesn't give me much money, but I think I'll have some more day after tomorrow.
                    Can I see you then?" </p>
                <p>"I don't know." </p>
                <p>He laughed. "You said that before. Day after tomorrow afternoon&mdash;in the
                    same place. No matter if it's raining. I'll be there first&mdash;at three.
                    Will you come?" </p>
                <p>"If I can." </p>
                <p>She made a movement to go. But still he detained her. He colored high again, in
                    the struggle between the impulses of his generous youth and the fear of being
                    absurd with a girl he had picked up in the street. He looked at her searchingly,
                    wistfully. "I know it's your life, but&mdash;I hate to think of it," he went
                    on. "You're far too nice. I don't see how you happened to be in&mdash;in
                    this line. Still, what else is there for a girl, when she's up against it? I've
                    often thought of those things&mdash;and I don't feel about them as most
                    people do. . . . I'm curious about you. You'll pardon me, won't you? I'm afraid
                    I'll fall in love with you, if I see you often. You won't fail to come day after
                    tomorrow?" </p>
                <p>"If I can." </p>
                <p>"Don't you want to see me again?" </p>
                <p>She did not speak or lift her eyes. </p>
                <p>"You like me, don't you?" </p>
                <p>Still no answer. </p>
                <p>"You don't want to be questioned?" </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0332" n="309"/>
                <p>"No," said the girl. </p>
                <p>"Where are you going now?" </p>
                <p>"To the hospital." </p>
                <p>"May I walk up there with you? I live in Clifton. I can go home that way." </p>
                <p>"I'd rather you didn't." </p>
                <p>"Then&mdash;good-by&mdash;till day after tomorrow at three." He put out
                    his hand; he had to reach for hers and take it. "You're not&mdash;not angry
                    with me?" </p>
                <p>"No." </p>
                <p>His eyes lingered tenderly upon her. "You are _so_ sweet! You don't know how I
                    want to kiss you. Are you sorry to go&mdash;sorry to leave me&mdash;just
                    a little?. . . I forgot. You don't like to be questioned. Well, good-by, dear." </p>
                <p>"Good-by," she said; and still without lifting her gaze from the ground she
                    turned away, walked slowly westward. </p>
                <p>She had not reached the next street to the north when she suddenly felt that if
                    she did not sit she would drop. She lifted her eyes for an instant to glance
                    furtively round. She saw a house with stone steps leading up to the front doors;
                    there was a "for rent" sign in one of the close-shuttered parlor windows. She
                    seated herself, supported the upper part of her weary body by resting her elbows
                    on her knees. Her bundle had rolled to the sidewalk at her feet. A passing man
                    picked it up, handed it to her, with a polite bow. She looked at him vaguely,
                    took the bundle as if she were not sure it was hers. </p>
                <p>"Heat been too much for you, miss?" asked the man. </p>
                <p>She shook her head. He lingered, talking volubly&mdash;about the
                    weather&mdash;then about how cool it was on the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002729_0333" n="310"/> hilltops. "We might go up to the
                    Bellevue," he finally suggested, "if you've nothing better to do." </p>
                <p>"No, thank you," she said. </p>
                <p>"I'll go anywhere you like. I've got a little money that I don't care to keep." </p>
                <p>She shook her head. </p>
                <p>"I don't mean anything bad," he hastened to suggest&mdash;because that would
                    bring up the subject in discussable form. </p>
                <p>"I can't go with you," said the girl drearily. "Don't bother me, please." </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;excuse me." And the man went on. </p>
                <p>Susan turned the bundle over in her lap, thrust her fingers slowly and
                    deliberately into the fold of the soiled blouse which was on the outside. She
                    drew out the money. A ten and two fives. Enough to keep his room at the hospital
                    for two weeks. No, for she must live, herself. Enough to give him a room one
                    week longer and to enable her to live two weeks at least. . . . And day after
                    tomorrow&mdash;more. Perhaps, soon&mdash;enough to see him through the
                    typhoid. She put the money in her bosom, rose and went on toward the hospital.
                    She no longer felt weary, and the sensation of a wound that might ache if she
                    were not so numb passed away. </p>
                <p>A clerk she had not seen before was at the barrier desk. "I came to ask how Mr.
                    Burlingham is," said she. </p>
                <p>The clerk yawned, drew a large book toward him.
                    "Burlingham&mdash;B&mdash;Bu&mdash;Bur&mdash;" he said half to
                    himself, turning over the leaves. "Yes&mdash;here he is." He looked at her.
                    "You his daughter?" </p>
                <p>"No, I'm a friend." </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;then&mdash;he died at five o'clock&mdash;an hour ago." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0334" n="311"/>
                <p>He looked up&mdash;saw her eyes&mdash;only her eyes. They were a deep
                    violet now, large, shining with tragic softness&mdash;like the eyes of an
                    angel that has lost its birthright through no fault of its own. He turned
                    hastily away, awed, terrified, ashamed of himself. </p>

                <p> THE next thing she knew, she felt herself seized strongly by the arm. She gazed
                    round in a dazed way. She was in the street&mdash;how she got there she had
                    no idea. The grip on her arm&mdash;it was the young doctor, Hamilton. "I
                    called you twice," explained he, "but you didn't hear." </p>
                <p>"He is dead," said she. </p>
                <p>Hamilton had a clear view of her face now. There was not a trace of the child
                    left. He saw her eyes&mdash;quiet, lonely, violet stars. "You must go and
                    rest quietly, " he said with gentleness. "You are worn out." </p>
                <p>Susan took from her bosom the twenty dollars, handed it to him. "It belongs to
                    him," said she. "Give it to them, to bury him." And she started on. </p>
                <p>"Where are you going?" asked the young man. </p>
                <p>Susan stopped, looked vaguely at him. "Good-by," she said. "You've been very
                    kind." </p>
                <p>"You've found a boarding place?" </p>
                <p>"Oh, I'm all right." </p>
                <p>"You want to see him?" </p>
                <p>"No. Then he'll always be alive to me." </p>
                <p>"You had better keep this money. The city will take care of the funeral." </p>
                <p>"It belong to him. I couldn't keep it for myself. I must be going." </p>
                <p>"Shan't I see you again?" </p>
                <p>"I'll not trouble you." </p>    
                <p>"Let me walk with you as far as your place." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0336" n="313"/>
                <p>"I'm not feeling&mdash;just right. If you don't
                    mind&mdash;please&mdash;I'd rather be alone." </p>
                <p>"I don't mean to intrude, but&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"I'm all right," said the girl. "Don't worry about me." </p>
                <p>"But you are too young&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"I've been married. . . . Thank you, but&mdash;good-by." </p>
                <p>He could think of no further excuse for detaining her. Her manner disquieted him,
                    yet it seemed composed and natural. Probably she had run away from a good home,
                    was now sobered and chastened, was eager to separate herself from the mess she
                    had got into and return to her own sort of people. It struck him as heartless
                    that she should go away in this fashion; but on second thought, he could not
                    associate heartlessness with her. Also, he saw how there might be something in
                    what she had said about not wishing to have to think of her friend as dead. He
                    stood watching her straight narrow young figure until it was lost to view in the
                    crowd of people going home from work. </p>
                <p>Susan went down Elm Street to Garfield Place, seated herself on one of the
                    benches. She was within sight of the unobtrusive little house with the awnings;
                    but she did not realize it. She had no sense of her surroundings, of the passing
                    of time, felt no grief, no sensation of any kind. She simply sat, her little
                    bundle in her lap, her hands folded upon it. </p>
                <p>A man in uniform paused before her. "Closing-up time," he said, sharply but in
                    the impartial official way. "I'm going to lock the gates." </p>
                <p>She looked at him. </p>
                <p>In a softer, apologetic tone, he said, "I've got to lock the gates. That's the
                law, miss." </p>
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0337" n="314"/>
                <p>She did not clearly understand, but rose and went out into Race Street. She
                    walked slowly along, not knowing or caring where. She
                    walked&mdash;walked&mdash;walked. Sometimes her way lay through crowded
                    streets, again through streets deserted. Now she was stumbling over the uneven
                    sidewalks of a poor quarter; again it was the smooth flagstones of the shopping
                    or wholesale districts. Several times she saw the river with its multitude of
                    boats great and small; several times she crossed the canal. Twice she turned
                    back because the street was mounting the hills behind the city&mdash;the
                    hills with the cars swiftly ascending and descending the inclined planes, and at
                    the crests gayly lighted pavilions where crowds were drinking and dancing.
                    Occasionally some man spoke to her, but desisted as she walked straight on,
                    apparently not hearing. She rested from time to time, on a stoop or on a barrel
                    or box left out by some shopkeeper, or leaning upon the rail of a canal bridge.
                    She was walking with a purpose&mdash;to try to scatter the dense fog that
                    had rolled in and enveloped her mind, and then to try to think. </p>
                <p>She sat, or rather dropped, down from sheer fatigue, in that cool hour which
                    precedes the dawn. It happened to be the steps of a church. She fell into a
                    doze, was startled back to consciousness by the deep boom of the bell in the
                    steeple; it made the stone vibrate under her.
                    One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four! Toward the east there shone a
                    flush of light, not yet strong enough to dim the stars. The sky above her was
                    clear. The pall of smoke rolled away. The air felt clean and fresh, even had in
                    it a reminiscence of the green fields whence it had come. She began to revive,
                    like a sleeper shaking off drowsiness and the spell of a bad dream and 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0338" n="315"/>
                    looking
                    forward to the new day. The fog that had swathed and stupefied her brain seemed
                    to have lifted. At her heart there was numbness and a dull throbbing, an ache;
                    but her mind was clear and her body felt intensely, hopelessly alive and ready,
                    clamorously ready, for food. A movement across the narrow street attracted her
                    attention. A cellar door was rising&mdash;thrust upward by the shoulders of
                    a man. It fell full open with a resounding crash, the man revealed by the light
                    from beneath&mdash;a white blouse, a white cap. Toward her wafted the
                    delicious odor of baking bread. She rose, hesitated only an instant, crossed the
                    street directly toward the baker who had come up to the surface for cool air. </p>
                <p>"I am hungry," said she to him. "Can't you let me have something to eat?" </p>
                <p>The man&mdash;he had a large, smooth, florid face eyed her in amused
                    astonishment. "Where'd you jump from?" he demanded. </p>
                <p>"I was resting on the church steps over there. The smell came to me
                    and&mdash;I couldn't stand it. I can pay." </p>
                <p>"Oh, that's all right," said the man, with a strong German accent. "Come down."
                    And he descended the steps, she following. It was a large and lofty cellar,
                    paved with cement; floor, ceilings, walls, were whitened with flour. There were
                    long clean tables for rolling the dough; big wooden bowls; farther back, the
                    ovens and several bakers at work adding to the huge piles of loaves the huge
                    baskets of rolls. Susan's eyes glistened; her white teeth showed in a delightful
                    smile of hunger about to be satisfied. </p>
                <p>"Do you want bread or rolls?" asked the German. Then without waiting for her to
                    answer, "I guess some 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0339" n="316"/>
                    of the `sweet rolls,' we call 'em, would about suit a
                    lady." </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;the sweet rolls," said the girl. </p>
                <p>The baker fumbled about behind a lot of empty baskets, found a sewing basket,
                    filled it with small rolls&mdash;some crescent in shape, some like lady
                    fingers, some oval, some almost like biscuit, all with pulverized sugar powdered
                    on them thick as a frosting. He set the little basket upon an empty kneading
                    table. "Wait yet a minute," he commanded, and bustled up a flight of stairs. He
                    reappeared with a bottle of milk and a piece of fresh butter. He put these
                    beside the basket of rolls, drew a stool up before them. "How's that?" asked he,
                    his hands on his hips, his head on one side, and his big jolly face beaming upon
                    her. "Pretty good, don't it!" </p>
                <p>Susan was laughing with pleasure. He pointed to the place well down in the bottle
                    of milk where the cream ended. "That's the way it should be always&mdash;not
                    so!" said he. She nodded. Then he shook the bottle to remix the separated cream
                    and milk. "So!" he cried. Then&mdash;" _Ach, dummer Esel!_" he muttered,
                    striking his brow a resounding thwack with the flat of his hand. "A knife!" And
                    he hastened to repair that omission. </p>
                <p>Susan sat at the table, took one of the fresh rolls, spread butter upon it. The
                    day will never come for her when she cannot distinctly remember the first bite
                    of the little sweet buttered roll, eaten in that air perfumed with the aroma of
                    baking bread. The milk was as fine as it promised to be she drank it from the
                    bottle. </p>
                <p>The German watched her a while, then beckoned to his fellow workmen. They stood
                    round, reveling in the 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0340" n="317"/>
                    joyful sight of this pretty hungry girl eating so happily
                    and so heartily. </p>
                <p>"The pie," whispered one workman to another. </p>
                <p>They brought a small freshly baked peach pie, light and crisp and brown. Susan's
                    beautiful eyes danced. "But," she said to her first friend among the bakers,
                    "I'm afraid I can't afford it." </p>
                <p>At this there was a loud chorus of laughter. "Eat it," said her friend. </p>
                <p>And when she had finished her rolls and butter, she did eat it. "I never tasted a
                    pie like that," declared she. "And I like pies and can make them too." </p>
                <p>Once more they laughed, as if she had said the wittiest thing in the world. </p>
                <p>As the last mouthful of the pie was disappearing, her friend said, "Another!" </p>
                <p>"Goodness, no!" cried the girl. "I couldn't eat a bite more." </p>
                <p>"But it's an apple pie." And he brought it, holding it on his big florid fat hand
                    and turning it round to show her its full beauty. </p>
                <p>She sighed regretfully. "I simply can't," she said. "How much is what I've had?" </p>
                <p>Her friend frowned. "Vot you take me for&mdash;hey?" demanded he, with a
                    terrible frown&mdash;so terrible he felt it to be that, fearing he had
                    frightened her, he burst out laughing, to reassure. </p>
                <p>"Oh, but I must pay," she pleaded. "I didn't come begging." </p>
                <p>"Not a cent!" said her friend firmly. "I'm the boss. I won't take it." </p>
                <p>She insisted until she saw she was hurting his feelings. Then she tried to thank
                    him; but he would not listen to that, either. "Good-by&mdash;good-by," he
                    said gruffly. 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0341" n="318"/>
                    "I must get to work once." But she understood, and went with a
                    light heart up into the world again. He stood waist deep in the cellar, she
                    hesitated upon the sidewalk. "Good-by," she said, with swimming eyes. "You don't
                    know how good you've been to me." </p>
                <p>"All right. Luck!" He waved his hand, half turned his back on her and looked
                    intently up the street, his eyes blinking. </p>
                <p>She went down the street, turned the first corner, dropped on a doorstep and
                    sobbed and cried, out of the fullness of her heart. When she rose to go on
                    again, she felt stronger and gentler than she had felt since her troubles began
                    with the quarrel over Sam Wright. A little further on she came upon a florist's
                    shop in front of which a wagon was unloading the supply of flowers for the day's
                    trade. She paused to look at the roses and carnations, the lilies and dahlias,
                    the violets and verbenas and geraniums. The fast brightening air was scented
                    with delicate odors. She was attracted to a small geranium with many buds and
                    two full-blown crimson flowers. </p>
                <p>"How much for that?" she asked a young man who seemed to be in charge. </p>
                <p>He eyed her shrewdly. "Well, I reckon about fifteen cents," replied he. </p>
                <p>She took from her bosom the dollar bill wrapped round the eighty cents, gave him
                    what he had asked. "No, you needn't tie it up," said she, as he moved to take it
                    into the store. She went back to the bakeshop. The cellar door was open, but no
                    one was in sight. Stooping down, she called: "Mr. Baker! Mr. Baker!" </p>
                <p>The big smooth face appeared below. </p>
                <p>She set the plant down on the top step. "For you," she said, and hurried away. </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0342" n="319"/>
                <p>On a passing street car she saw the sign "Eden Park." She had heard of
                    it&mdash;of its beauties, of the wonderful museum there. She took the next
                    car of the same line. A few minutes, and it was being drawn up the inclined
                    plane toward the lofty hilltops. She had thought the air pure below. She was
                    suddenly lifted through a dense vapor&mdash;the cloud that always lies over
                    the lower part of the city. A moment, and she was above the cloud, was being
                    carried through the wide, clean tree-lined avenue of a beautiful suburb. On
                    either side, lawns and gardens and charming houses, a hush brooding over them.
                    Behind these walls, in comfortable beds, amid the surroundings that come to mind
                    with the word "home," lay many girls such as she&mdash;happy, secure,
                    sheltered. Girls like herself. A wave of homesickness swept over her, daunting
                    her for a little while. But she fought it down, watched what was going on around
                    her. "I mustn't look back&mdash;I mustn't! Nothing there for me." At the
                    main gateway of the park she descended. There indeed was the, to her, vast
                    building containing the treasures of art; but she had not come for that. She
                    struck into the first by-path, sought out a grassy slope thickly studded with
                    bushes, and laid herself down. She spread her skirts carefully so as not to muss
                    them. She put her bundle under her head. </p>
                <p>When she awoke the moon was shining upon her face&mdash;shining from a starry
                    sky! </p>
                <p>She sat up, looked round in wonder. Yes&mdash;it was night
                    again&mdash;very still, very beautiful, and warm, with the air fragrant and
                    soft. She felt intensely awake, entirely rested&mdash;and full of hope. It
                    was as if during that long dreamless sleep her whole being had been renewed and
                    magically borne away from the lands of 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0343" n="320"/>
                    shadow and pain where it had been
                    wandering, to a land of bright promise. Oh, youth, youth, that bears so lightly
                    the burden of the past, that faces so confidently the mystery of the future! She
                    listened&mdash;heard a faint sound that moved her to investigate. Peering
                    through the dense bushes, she discovered on the grass in the shadow of the next
                    clump, a ragged, dirty man and woman, both sound asleep and snoring gently. She
                    watched them spellbound. The man's face was deeply shaded by his battered straw
                    hat. But she could see the woman's face plainly&mdash;the thin, white hair,
                    the sunken eyes and mouth, the skeleton look of old features over which the dry
                    skin of age is tightly drawn. She gazed until the man, moving in his sleep,
                    kicked out furiously and uttered a curse. She drew back, crawled away until she
                    had put several clumps of bushes between her and the pair. Then she sped down
                    and up the slopes and did not stop until she was where she could see, far below,
                    the friendly lights of the city blinking at her through the smoky mist. </p>
                <p>She had forgotten her bundle! She did not know how to find the place where she
                    had left it; and, had she known, she would not have dared return. This loss,
                    however, troubled her little. Not in vain had she dwelt with the philosopher
                    Burlingham. </p>
                <p>She seated herself on a bench and made herself comfortable. But she no longer
                    needed sleep. She was awake&mdash;wide awake&mdash;in every atom of her
                    vigorous young body. The minutes dragged. She was impatient for the dawn to give
                    the signal for the future to roll up its curtain. She would have gone down into
                    the city to walk about but she was now afraid the police would take her
                    in&mdash;and that probably would mean going to a reformatory, for she could
                    not give 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0344" n="321"/>
                    a satisfactory account of herself. True, her older way of wearing her
                    hair and some slight but telling changes in her dress had made her look less the
                    child. But she could not hope to pass for a woman full grown. The moon set; the
                    starlight was after a long, long time succeeded by the dawn of waking birds, and
                    of waking city, too&mdash;for up from below rose an ever louder roar like a
                    rising storm. In her restless rovings, she came upon a fountain; she joined the
                    birds making a toilet in its basin, and patterned after them&mdash;washed
                    her face and hands, dried them on a handkerchief she by great good luck had put
                    into her stocking, smoothed her hair, her dress. </p>
                <p>And still the sense of unreality persisted, cast its friendly spell over this
                    child-woman suddenly caught up from the quietest of quiet lives and whirled into
                    a dizzy vortex of strange events without parallel, or similitude even, in
                    anything she had ever known. If anyone had suddenly asked her who she was and
                    she had tried to recall, she would have felt as if trying to remember a dream.
                    Sutherland&mdash;a faint, faint dream, and the show boat also.
                    Spenser&mdash;a romantic dream&mdash;or a first installment of a
                    lovestory read in some stray magazine. Burlingham&mdash;the theatrical
                    agent&mdash;the young man of the previous afternoon&mdash;the news of
                    the death that left her quite alone&mdash;all a dream, a tumbled, jumbled
                    dream, all passed with the night and the awakening. In her youth and perfect
                    health, refreshed by the long sleep, gladdened by the bright new day, she was as
                    irresponsible as the merry birds chattering and flinging the water about at the
                    opposite side of the fountain's basin. She was now glad she had lost her bundle.
                    Without it her hands were free both hands free to take whatever might offer
                    next. And she was 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0345" n="322"/>
                    eager to see what that would be, and hopeful about
                    it&mdash;no&mdash;more than hopeful, confident. Burlingham, aided by
                    those highly favorable surroundings of the show boat, and of the vagabond life
                    thereafter, had developed in her that gambler's spirit which had enabled him to
                    play year after year of losing hands with unabating courage&mdash;the spirit
                    that animates all the brave souls whose deeds awe the docile, conventional,
                    craven masses of mankind. </p>
                <p>Leisurely as a truant she tramped back toward the city, pausing to observe
                    anything that chanced to catch her eye. At the moment of her discovery of the
                    difference between her and most girls there had begun a cleavage between her and
                    the social system. And now she felt as if she were of one race and the rest of
                    the world of another and hostile race. She did not realize it, but she had taken
                    the first great step along the path that leads to distinction or destruction.
                    For the world either obeys or tramples into dust those who, in whatever way,
                    have a lot apart from the common. She was free from the bonds of
                    convention&mdash;free to soar or to sink. </p>
                <p>Her way toward the city lay along a slowly descending street that had been, not
                    so very long before, a country road. Block after block there were grassy fields
                    intersected by streets, as if city had attempted a conquest of country and had
                    abandoned it. Again the vacant lots were disfigured with the ruins of a shanty
                    or by dreary dump heaps. For long stretches the way was built up only on one
                    side. The houses were for the most part tenement with small and unprosperous
                    shops or saloons on the ground floor. Toward the foot of the hill, where the
                    line of tenements was continuous on either side, she saw a sign "Restaurant"
                    projecting 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0346" n="323"/>
                    over the sidewalk. When she reached it, she paused and looked in. A
                    narrow window and a narrow open door gave a full view of the tiny room with its
                    two rows of plain tables. Near the window was a small counter with a case
                    containing cakes and pies and rolls. With back to the window sat a pretty
                    towheaded girl of about her own age, reading. Susan, close to the window, saw
                    that the book was Owen Meredith's "Lucile," one of her own favorites. She could
                    even read the words: </p>
                <p> The ways they are many and wide, and seldom are two ways the same. </p>
                <p> She entered. The girl glanced up, with eyes slowly changing from far-away
                    dreaminess to present and practical&mdash;pleasant blue eyes with lashes and
                    brows of the same color as the thick, neatly done yellowish hair. </p>
                <p>"Could I get a glass of milk and a roll?" asked Susan, a modest demand, indeed,
                    on behalf of a growing girl's appetite twenty-four hours unsatisfied. </p>
                <p>The blonde girl smiled, showing a clean mouth with excellent teeth. "We sell the
                    milk for five cents, the rolls three for a nickel." </p>
                <p>"Then I'll take milk and three rolls," said Susan. "May I sit at a table? I'll
                    not spoil it." </p>
                <p>"Sure. Sit down. That's what the tables are for." And the girl closed the book,
                    putting a chromo card in it to mark her place, and stirred about to serve the
                    customer. Susan took the table nearest the door, took the seat facing the light.
                    The girl set before her a plate, a knife and fork, a little form of butter, a
                    tall glass of milk, and three small rolls in a large saucer. 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0347" n="324"/>
                    "You're up and out
                    early?" she said to Susan. </p>
                <p>On one of those inexplicable impulses of frankness Susan replied: "I've been
                    sleeping in the park." </p>
                <p>The girl had made the remark merely to be polite and was turning away. As Susan's
                    reply penetrated to her inattentive mind she looked sharply at her, eyes opening
                    wonderingly. "Did you get lost? Are you a stranger in town? Why didn't you ask
                    someone to take you in?" </p>
                <p>The girl reflected, realized. "That's so," said she. "I never thought of it
                    before. . . . Yes, that is so! It must be dreadful not to have any place to go."
                    She gazed at Susan with admiring eyes. "Weren't you afraid&mdash;up in the
                    park?" </p>
                <p>"No," replied Susan. "I hadn't anything anybody'd want to steal." </p>
                <p>"But some man might have&mdash;" The girl left it to Susan's imagination to
                    finish the sentence. </p>
                <p>"I hadn't anything to steal," repeated Susan, with a kind of cynical melancholy
                    remotely suggestive of Mabel Connemora. </p>
                <p>The restaurant girl retired behind the counter to reflect, while Susan began upon
                    her meager breakfast with the deliberation of one who must coax a little to go a
                    great ways. Presently the girl said: </p>
                <p>"Where are you going to sleep tonight?" </p>
                <p>"Oh, that's a long ways off," replied the apt pupil of the happy-go-lucky
                    houseboat show. "I'll find a place, I guess." </p>
                <p>The girl looked thoughtfully toward the street. "I was wondering," she said after
                    a while, "what I'd do if I was to find myself out in the street, with no money
                    and nowhere to go. . . . Are you looking for something to do?" </p>
               
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0348" n="325"/>
                <p>"Do you know of anything?" asked Susan interested at once. </p>
                <p>"Nothing worth while. There's a box factory down on the next square. But only a
                    girl that lives at home can work there. Pa says the day's coming when women'll
                    be like men&mdash;work at everything and get the same wages. But it isn't so
                    now. A girl's got to get married." </p>
                <p>Such a strange expression came over Susan's face that the waitress looked
                    apologetic and hastened to explain herself: "I don't much mind the idea of
                    getting married," said she. "Only&mdash;I'm afraid I can never get the kind
                    of a man I'd want. The boys round here leave school before the girls, so the
                    girls are better educated. And then they feel above the boys of their own
                    class&mdash;except those boys that're beginning to get up in the
                    world&mdash;and those kind of boys want some girl who's above them and can
                    help them up. It's dreadful to be above the people you know and not good enough
                    for the people you'd like to know." </p>
                <p>Susan was not impressed; she could not understand why the waitress spoke with so
                    much feeling. "Well," said she, pausing before beginning on the last roll, "I
                    don't care so long as I find something to do." </p>
                <p>"There's another thing," complained the waitress. "If you work in a store, you
                    can't get wages enough to live on; and you learn things, and want to live better
                    and better all the time. It makes you miserable. And you can't marry the men who
                    work at nice refined labor because they don't make enough to marry on. And if
                    you work in a factory or as a servant, why all but the commonest kind of men
                    look down on you. You may get wages enough to live on, but you can't marry or
                    get up in the world." </p>
               
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0349" n="326"/>
                <p>"You're very ambitious, aren't you?" </p>
                <p>"Indeed I am. I don't want to be in the working class." She was leaning over the
                    counter now, and her blond face was expressing deep discontent and scorn. "I
                    _hate_ working people. All of them who have any sense look down on themselves
                    and wish they could get something respectable to do." </p>
                <p>"Oh, you don't mean that," protested Susan. "Any kind of work's respectable if
                    it's honest." </p>
                <p>"_You_ can say that," retorted the girl. "_You_ don't belong in our class. You
                    were brought up different. You are a _lady_." </p>
                <p>Susan shrank and grew crimson. The other girl did not see. She went on crossly: </p>
                <p>"Upper-class people always talk about how fine it is to be an honest workingman.
                    But that's all rot. Let 'em try it a while. And pa says it'll never be
                    straightened out till everybody has to work." </p>
                <p>"What&mdash;what does your father do?" </p>
                <p>"He was a cabinetmaker. Then one of the other men tipped over a big chest and his
                    right hand was crushed&mdash;smashed to pieces, so he wasn't able to work
                    any more. But he's mighty smart in his brains. It's the kind you can't make any
                    money out of. He has read most everything. The trouble with pa was he had too
                    much heart. He wasn't mean enough to try and get ahead of the other workmen, and
                    rise to be a boss over them, and grind them down to make money for the
                    proprietor. So he stayed on at the bench&mdash;he was a first-class
                    cabinetmaker. The better a man is as a workman, and the nicer he is as a man,
                    the harder it is for him to get up. Pa was too good at his trade&mdash;and
                    too soft-hearted. Won't you have another glass of milk?" </p>
               
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0350" n="327"/>
                <p>"No&mdash;thank you," said Susan. She was still hungry, but it alarmed her to
                    think of taking more than ten cents from her hoard. </p>
                <p>"Are you going to ask for work at the box factory?" </p>
                <p>"I'm afraid they wouldn't take me. I don't know how to make boxes." </p>
                <p>"Oh, that's nothing," assured the restaurant girl. </p>
                <p>"It's the easiest kind of work. But then an educated person can pick up most any
                    trade in a few days, well enough to get along. They'll make you a paster, at
                    first." </p>
                <p>"How much does that pay?" </p>
                <p>"He'll offer you two fifty a week, but you must make him give you three. That's
                    right for beginners. Then, if you stay on and work hard, you'll be raised to
                    four after six months. The highest pay's five." </p>
                <p>"Three dollars," said Susan. "How much can I rent a room for?" </p>
                <p>The restaurant girl looked at her pityingly. "Oh, you can't afford a room. You'll
                    have to club in with three other girls and take a room together, and cook your
                    meals yourselves, turn about." </p>
                <p>Susan tried not to show how gloomy this prospect seemed. "I'll try," said she. </p>
                <p>She paid the ten cents; her new acquaintance went with her to the door, pointed
                    out the huge bare wooden building displaying in great letters "J. C. Matson,
                    Paper Boxes." "You apply at the office," said the waitress. "There'll be a fat
                    black-complected man in his shirt with his suspenders let down off his
                    shoulders. </p>
                <p>He'll be fresh with you. He used to be a working man himself, so he hasn't any
                    respect for working people. But he doesn't mean any harm. He isn't like a good
                    many; he lets his girls alone." </p>
               
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0351" n="328"/>
                <p>Susan had not got far when the waitress came running after her. "Won't you come
                    back and let me know how you made out?" she asked, a little embarrassed. "I hope
                    you don't think I'm fresh." </p>
                <p>"I'll be glad to come," Susan assured her. And their eyes met in a friendly
                    glance. </p>
                <p>"If you don't find a place to go, why not come in with me? I've got only a very
                    little bit of a room, but it's as big and a lot cleaner than any you'll find
                    with the factory girls." </p>
                <p>"But I haven't any money," said Susan regretfully. "And I couldn't take anything
                    without paying." </p>
                <p>"You could pay two dollars and a half a week and eat in with us. We couldn't
                    afford to give you much for that, but it'd be better than what you'd get the
                    other way." </p>
                <p>"But you can't afford to do that." </p>
                <p>The restaurant girl's mind was aroused, was working fast and well. "You can help
                    in the restaurant of evenings," she promptly replied. "I'll tell ma you're so
                    pretty you'll draw trade. And I'll explain that you used to go to school with
                    me&mdash;and have lost your father and mother. My name's Etta Brashear." </p>
                <p>"Mine's&mdash;Lorna Sackville," said Susan, blushing. "I'll come after a
                    while, and we'll talk about what to do. I may not get a place." </p>
                <p>"Oh, you'll get it. He has hard work finding girls. Factories usually pay more
                    than stores, because the work's more looked down on&mdash;though Lord knows
                    it's hard to think how anything could be more looked down on than a saleslady." </p>
                <p>"I don't see why you bother about those things. What do they matter?" </p>
                <p>"Why, everybody bothers about them. But you 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0352" n="329"/>
                    don't understand. You were born a
                    lady, and you'll always feel you've got social standing, and people'll feel that
                    way too." </p>
                <p>"But I wasn't," said Susan earnestly. "Indeed, I wasn't. I was
                    born&mdash;a&mdash;a nobody. I can't tell you, but I'm just nobody. I
                    haven't even got a name." </p>
                <p>Etta, as romantic as the next young girl, was only the more fascinated by the now
                    thrillingly mysterious stranger&mdash;so pretty, so sweet, with such
                    beautiful manners and strangely outcast no doubt from some family of "high
                    folks." "You'll be sure to come? You won't disappoint me?" </p>
                <p>Susan kissed Etta. Etta embraced Susan, her cheeks flushed, her eyes brilliant.
                    "`I've taken an awful fancy to you," she said. "I haven't ever had an intimate
                    lady friend. I don't care for the girls round here. They're so fresh and common.
                    Ma brought me up refined; she's not like the ordinary working-class woman." </p>
                <p>It hurt Susan deeply&mdash;why, she could not have quite
                    explained&mdash;to hear Etta talk in this fashion. And in spite of herself
                    her tone was less friendly as she said, "I'll come when I find out." </p>

                <head> XIX</head>
                <p> IN the office of the factory Susan found the man Etta described. He was seated,
                    or, rather, was sprawled before an open and overflowing rolltop desk, his collar
                    and cuffs off, and his coat and waistcoat also. His feet&mdash;broad, thick
                    feet with knots at the great toe joints bulging his shoes&mdash;were hoisted
                    upon the leaf of the desk. Susan's charms of person and manners so wrought upon
                    him that, during the exchange of preliminary questions and answers, he slowly
                    took down first one foot then the other, and readjusted his once muscular but
                    now loose and pudgy body into a less loaferish posture. He was as unconscious as
                    she of the cause and meaning of these movements. Had he awakened to what he was
                    doing he would probably have been angered against himself and against her; and
                    the direction of Susan Lenox's life would certainly have been changed. Those who
                    fancy the human animal is in the custody of some conscious and predetermining
                    destiny think with their vanity rather than with their intelligence. A careful
                    look at any day or even hour of any life reveals the inevitable influence of
                    sheer accidents, most of them trivial. And these accidents, often the most
                    trivial, most powerfully determine not only the direction but also the degree
                    and kind of force&mdash;what characteristics shall develop and what shall
                    dwindle. </p>
                <p>"You seem to have a nut on you," said the box manufacturer at the end of the
                    examination. "I'll start you at three." </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0354" n="331"/>
                <p>Susan, thus suddenly "placed" in the world and ticketed with a real value, was so
                    profoundly excited that she could not even make a stammering attempt at
                    expressing gratitude. </p>
                <p>"Do your work well," continued Matson, "and you'll have a good steady job with me
                    till you get some nice young fellow to support you. Stand the boys off. Don't
                    let 'em touch you till you're engaged&mdash;and not much then till the
                    preacher's said the word." </p>
                <p>"Thank you," said Susan, trying to look grave. She was fascinated by his curious
                    habit of scratching himself as he talked&mdash;head, ribs, arm, legs, the
                    backs of his red hairy hands. </p>
                <p>"Stand 'em off," pursued the box-maker, scratching his ribs and nodding his huge
                    head vigorously. "That's the way my wife got me. It's pull Dick pull devil with
                    the gals and the boys. And the gal that's stiff with the men gets a home, while
                    her that ain't goes to the streets. I always gives my gals a word of good
                    advice. And many a one I've saved. There's mighty few preachers does as much
                    good as me. When can you go to work?" </p>
                <p>Susan reflected. With heightened color and a slight stammer she said, "I've got
                    something to do this afternoon, if you'll let me. Can I come in the morning?"
                    "Seven sharp. We take off a cent a minute up to a quarter of an hour. If you're
                    later than that, you get docked for the day. And no excuses. I didn't climb to
                    the top from spittoon cleaner in a saloon fifteen years ago by being an easy
                    mark for my hands." </p>
                <p>"I'll come at seven in the morning," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"Do you live far?" </p>
                <p>"I'm going to live just up the street." </p>
                <p>"That's right. It adds ten cents a day to your 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0355" n="332"/>
                    wages&mdash;the ten you'll
                    save in carfare. Sixty cents a week!" And Matson beamed and scratched as if he
                    felt he had done a generous act. "Who are you livin' with? Respectable, I hope." </p>
                <p>"With Miss Brashear&mdash;I think." </p>
                <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;Tom Brashear's gal. They're nice people. Tom's an honest
                    fellow&mdash;used to make good money till he had his hard luck. Him and me
                    used to work together. But he never could seem to learn that it ain't workin'
                    for yourself but makin' others work for you that climbs a man up. I never was
                    much as a worker. I was always thinkin' out ways of makin' people work for me.
                    And here I am at the top. And where's Tom? Well&mdash;run along
                    now&mdash;what's your name?" </p>
                <p>"Lorna Sackville." </p>
                <p>"Lorny." He burst into a loud guffaw. "Lord, what a name! Sounds like a theayter.
                    Seven sharp, Lorny. So long." </p>
                <p>Susan nodded with laughing eyes, thanked him and departed. She glanced up the
                    street, saw Etta standing in the door of the restaurant. Etta did not move from
                    her own doorway, though she was showing every sign of anxiety and impatience. "I
                    can't leave even for a minute so near the dinner hour," she explained when Susan
                    came, "or I'd, a' been outside the factory. And ma's got to stick to the
                    kitchen. I see you got a job. How much?" </p>
                <p>"Three," replied Susan. </p>
                <p>"He must have offered it to you," said Etta, laughing. "I thought about it after
                    you were gone and I knew you'd take whatever he said first. Oh, I've been so
                    scared something'd happen. I do want you as my lady friend. Was he fresh?" </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0356" n="333"/>
                <p>"Not a bit. He was&mdash;very nice." </p>
                <p>"Well, he ought to be nice&mdash;as pa says, getting richer and richer, and
                    driving the girls he robs to marry men they hate or to pick up a living in the
                    gutter." </p>
                <p>Susan felt that she owed her benefactor a strong protest. "Maybe I'm foolish,"
                    said she, "but I'm awful glad he's got that place and can give me work." </p>
                <p>Etta was neither convinced nor abashed. "You don't understand things in our
                    class," replied she. "Pa says it was the kind of grateful thinking and talking
                    you've just done that's made him poor in his old age. He says you've either got
                    to whip or be whipped, rob or be robbed&mdash;and that the really good
                    honest people are the fools who take the losing side. But he says, too, he'd
                    rather be a fool and a failure than stoop to stamping on his fellow-beings and
                    robbing them. And I guess he's right"&mdash;there Etta
                    laughed&mdash;"though I'll admit I'd hate to be tempted with a chance to get
                    up by stepping on somebody." She sighed. "And sometimes I can't help wishing pa
                    had done some tramping and stamping. Why not? That's all most people are fit
                    for&mdash;to be tramped and stamped on. Now, don't look so shocked. You
                    don't understand. Wait till you've been at work a while." </p>
                <p>Susan changed the subject. "I'm going to work at seven in the morning. . . . I
                    might as well have gone today. I had a kind of an engagement I thought I was
                    going to keep, but I've about decided I won't." </p>
                <p>Etta watched with awe and delight the mysterious look in Susan's suddenly flushed
                    face and abstracted eyes. After a time she ventured to interrupt with: </p>
                <p>"You'll try living with us?" </p>
                <p>"If you're quite sure&mdash;did you talk to your mother?" </p>
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0357" n="334"/>
                <p>"Mother'll be crazy about you. She wants anything that'll make me more contented.
                    Oh, I do get so lonesome!" </p>
                <p>Mrs. Brashear, a spare woman, much bent by monotonous work&mdash;which,
                    however, had not bent her courage or her cheerfulness&mdash;made Susan feel
                    at home immediately in the little flat. The tenement was of rather a superior
                    class. But to Susan it seemed full of noisome smells, and she was offended by
                    the halls littered with evidences of the uncleanness of the tenants. She did not
                    then realize that the apparent superior cleanness and neatness of the better-off
                    classes was really in large part only affected, that their secluded back doors
                    and back ways gave them opportunity to hide their uncivilized habits from the
                    world that saw only the front. However, once inside the Brashear flat, she had
                    an instant rise of spirits. </p>
                <p>"Isn't this nice?" exclaimed she as Etta showed her, at a glance from the
                    sitting-room, the five small but scrupulously clean rooms. "I'll like it here!" </p>
                <p>Etta reddened, glanced at her for signs of mockery, saw that she was in earnest.
                    "I'm afraid it's better to look at than to live in," she began, then decided
                    against saying anything discouraging. "It seems cramped to us," said she, "after
                    the house we had till a couple of years ago. I guess we'll make out, somehow." </p>
                <p>The family paid twenty dollars a month for the flat. The restaurant earned twelve
                    to fifteen a week; and the son, Ashbel, stocky, powerful and stupid, had a
                    steady job as porter at ten a week. He gave his mother seven, as he had a room
                    to himself and an enormous appetite. He talked of getting married; if he did
                    marry, the family finances would be in disorder. But his girl had high ideas,
                    being the daughter of a 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0358" n="335"/>
                    grocer who fancied himself still an independent merchant
                    though he was in fact the even more poorly paid selling agent of the various
                    food products trusts. She had fixed twenty a week as the least on which she
                    would marry; his prospects of any such raise were&mdash;luckily for his
                    family&mdash;extremely remote; for he had nothing but physical strength to
                    sell, and the price of physical strength alone was going down, under immigrant
                    competition, not only in actual wages like any other form of wage labor, but
                    also in nominal wages. </p>
                <p>Altogether, the Brashears were in excellent shape for a tenement family, were
                    better off than upwards of ninety per cent of the families of prosperous and
                    typical Cincinnati. While it was true that old Tom Brashear drank, it was also
                    true that he carefully limited himself to two dollars a week. While it was true
                    that he could not work at his trade and apparently did little but sit round and
                    talk&mdash;usually high above his audience&mdash;nevertheless he was the
                    actual head of the family and its chief bread-winner. It was his savings that
                    were invested in the restaurant; he bought the supplies and was shrewd and
                    intelligent about that vitally important department of the
                    business&mdash;the department whose mismanagement in domestic economy is,
                    next to drink, the main cause of failure and pauperism, of sickness, of
                    premature disability, of those profound discouragements that lead to despair.
                    Also, old Brashear had the sagacity and the nagging habit that are necessary to
                    keeping people and things up to the mark. He had ideas&mdash;practical ideas
                    as well as ideals&mdash;far above his station. But for him the housekeeping
                    would have been in the familiar tenement fashion of slovenliness and filth, and
                    the family would have been 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0359" n="336"/>
                    neat only on Sundays, and only on the surface then.
                    Because he had the habit of speaking of himself as useless, as done for, as a
                    drag, as one lingering on when he ought to be dead, his family and all the
                    neighborhood thought of him in that way. Although intelligence, indeed, virtue
                    of every kind, is expected of tenement house people&mdash;and is needed by
                    them beyond any other condition of humanity&mdash;they are unfortunately
                    merely human, are tainted of all human weaknesses. They lack, for instance,
                    discrimination. So, it never occurred to them that Tom Brashear was the sole
                    reason why the Brashears lived better than any of the other families and yielded
                    less to the ferocious and incessant downward pressure. </p>
                <p>But for one thing the Brashears would have been going up in the world. That thing
                    was old Tom's honesty. The restaurant gave good food and honest measure.
                    Therefore, the margin of profit was narrow&mdash;too narrow. He knew what
                    was the matter. He mocked at himself for being "such a weak fool" when everybody
                    else with the opportunity and the intelligence was getting on by yielding to the
                    compulsion of the iron rule of dishonesty in business. But he remained
                    honest&mdash;therefore, remained in the working class, instead of rising
                    among its exploiters. </p>
                <p>"If I didn't drink, I'd kill myself," said old Tom to Susan, when he came to know
                    her well and to feel that from her he could get not the mere blind admiration
                    the family gave him but understanding and sympathy. "Whenever anybody in the
                    working class has any imagination," he explained, "he either kicks his way out
                    of it into capitalist or into criminal&mdash;or else he takes to drink. I
                    ain't mean enough to be either a capitalist or a criminal. So, I've got to
                    drink." </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0360" n="337"/>
                <p>Susan only too soon began to appreciate from her own experience what he meant. </p>
                <p>In the first few days the novelty pleased her, made her think she was going to be
                    contented. The new friends and acquaintances, different from any she had known,
                    the new sights, the new way of living&mdash;all this interested her, even
                    when it shocked one or many of her senses and sensibilities. But the novelty of
                    folding and pasting boxes, of the queer new kind of girls who worked with her,
                    hardly survived into the second week. She saw that she was among a people where
                    the highest known standard&mdash;the mode of life regarded by them as the
                    acme of elegance and bliss&mdash;the best they could conceive was far, far
                    below what she had been brought up to believe the scantest necessities of
                    respectable and civilized living. She saw this life from the inside
                    now&mdash;as the comfortable classes never permit themselves to see it if
                    they can avoid. She saw that to be a contented working girl, to look forward to
                    the prospect of being a workingman's wife, a tenement housekeeper and mother, a
                    woman must have been born to it&mdash;and born with little
                    brains&mdash;must have been educated for it, and for nothing else. Etta was
                    bitterly discontented; yet after all it was a vague endurable discontent. She
                    had simply heard of and dreamed of and from afar off&mdash;chiefly through
                    novels and poems and the theater&mdash;had glimpsed a life that was broader,
                    that had comfort and luxury, people with refined habits and manners. Susan had
                    not merely heard of such a life; she had lived it&mdash;it, and no other. </p>
                <p>Always of the thoughtful temperament, she had been rapidly developed first by
                    Burlingham and now by Tom Brashear&mdash;had been taught not only how to
                    think but also how to gather the things to think about. </p>
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0361" n="338"/>
                <p>With a few exceptions the girls at the factory were woefully unclean about their
                    persons. Susan did not blame them; she only wondered at Etta the more, and grew
                    to admire her&mdash;and the father who held the whole family up to the mark.
                    For, in spite of the difficulties of getting clean, without bathtub, without any
                    but the crudest and cheapest appliances for cleanliness, without any leisure
                    time, Etta kept herself in perfect order. The show boat and the quarters at the
                    hotel had been trying to Susan. But they had seemed an adventure, a temporary,
                    passing phase, a sort of somewhat prolonged camping-out lark. Now, she was
                    settled down, to live, apparently for the rest of her life, with none of the
                    comforts, with few of the decencies. What Etta and her people, using all their
                    imagination, would have pictured as the pinnacle of luxury would have been for
                    Susan a small and imperfect part of what she had been bred to regard as "living
                    decently." She suspected that but for Etta's example she would be yielding, at
                    least in the matter of cleanliness, when the struggle against dirt was so
                    unequal, was thankless. Discouragement became her frequent mood; she wondered if
                    the time would not come when it would be her fixed habit, as it was with all but
                    a handful of those about her. </p>
                <p>Sometimes she and Etta walked in the quarter at the top of the hill where lived
                    the families of prosperous merchants&mdash;establishments a little larger, a
                    little more pretentious than her Uncle George's in Sutherland, but on the whole
                    much like it&mdash;the houses of the solid middle class which fancies itself
                    grandly luxurious where it is in fact merely comfortable in a crude
                    unimaginative way. Susan was one of those who are born with the instinct and
                    mental bent for luxurious comfort; also, she had the accompanying peculiar
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0362" n="339"/>
                    talent for assimilating ideas about food and dress and surroundings from books
                    and magazines, from the study of well-dressed people in the street, from glances
                    into luxurious interiors through windows or open doors as she passed by. She saw
                    with even quicker and more intelligently critical eyes the new thing, the good
                    idea, the improvement on what she already knew. Etta's excitement over these
                    commonplace rich people amused her. She herself, on the wings of her daring
                    young fancy, could soar into a realm of luxury, of beauty and exquisite comfort,
                    that made these self-complacent mansions seem very ordinary indeed. It was no
                    drag upon her fancy, but the reverse, that she was sharing a narrow bed and a
                    narrow room in a humble and tiny tenement flat. </p>
                <p>On one of these walks Etta confided to her the only romance of her life therefore
                    the real cause of her deep discontent. It was a young man from one of these
                    houses&mdash;a flirtation lasting about a year. She assured Susan it was
                    altogether innocent. Susan&mdash;perhaps chiefly because Etta protested so
                    insistently about her unsullied purity&mdash;had her doubts. </p>
                <p>"Then," said Etta, "when I saw that he didn't care anything about me except in
                    one way&mdash;I didn't see him any more. I&mdash;I've been sorry ever
                    since." </p>
                <p>Susan did not offer the hoped-for sympathy. She was silent. </p>
                <p>"Did you ever have anything like that happen to you?" inquired Etta. </p>
                <p>"Yes," said Susan. "Something like that." </p>
                <p>"And what did you do?" </p>
                <p>"I didn't want to see him any more." </p>
                <p>"Why?" </p>
                <p>"I don't know&mdash;exactly. </p>
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0363" n="340"/>
                <p>"And you like him?" </p>
                <p>"I think I would have liked him." </p>
                <p>"You're sorry you stopped?" </p>
                <p>"Sometimes," replied she, hesitatingly. </p>
                <p>She was beginning to be afraid that she would soon be sorry all the time. Every
                    day the war within burst forth afresh. She reproached herself for her growing
                    hatred of her life. Ought she not to be grateful that she had so
                    much&mdash;that she was not one of a squalid quartette in a foul,
                    vermin-infested back bedroom&mdash;infested instead of only occasionally
                    visited&mdash;that she was not a streetwalker, diseased, prowling in all
                    weathers, the prey of the coarse humors of contemptuous and usually drunken
                    beasts; that she was not living where everyone about her would, by pity or out
                    of spitefulness, tear open the wounds of that hideous brand which had been put
                    upon her at birth? Above all, she ought to be thankful that she was not Jeb
                    Ferguson's wife. </p>
                <p>But her efforts to make herself resigned and contented, to kill her doubts as to
                    the goodness of "goodness," were not successful. She had Tom Brashear's
                    "ungrateful" nature&mdash;the nature that will not let a man or a woman stay
                    in the class of hewers of wood and drawers of water but drives him or her out of
                    it&mdash;and up or down. </p>
                <p>"You're one of those that things happen to," the old cabinetmaker said to her on
                    a September evening, as they sat on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. The
                    tenements had discharged their swarms into the hot street, and there was that
                    lively panorama of dirt and disease and depravity which is
                    fascinating&mdash;to unaccustomed eyes. "Yes," said Tom, "things'll happen
                    to you." </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0364" n="341"/>
                <p>"What&mdash;for instance?" she asked. </p>
                <p>"God only knows. You'll up and do something some day. You're settin' here just to
                    grow wings. Some day&mdash;swish!&mdash;and off you'll soar. It's a pity
                    you was born female. Still&mdash;there's a lot of females that gets up. Come
                    to think of it, I guess sex don't matter. It's havin' the soul&mdash;and
                    mighty few of either sex has it." </p>
                <p>"Oh, I'm like everybody else," said the girl with an impatient sigh. "I dream,
                    but&mdash;it doesn't come to anything." </p>
                <p>"No, you ain't like everybody else," retorted he, with a positive shake of his
                    finely shaped head, thatched superbly with white hair. "You ain't afraid, for
                    instance. That's the principal sign of a great soul, I guess." </p>
                <p>"Oh, but I _am_ afraid," cried Susan. "I've only lately found out what a coward I
                    am." </p>
                <p>"You think you are," said the cabinetmaker. "There's them that's afraid to do,
                    and don't do. Then there's them that's afraid to do, but goes ahead and does
                    anyhow. That's you. I don't know where you came from&mdash;oh, I heard
                    Etta's accountin' for you to her ma, but that's neither here nor there. I don't
                    know where you come from, and I don't know where you're going. But&mdash;you
                    ain't afraid&mdash;and you have imagination&mdash;and those two signs
                    means something doing." </p>
                <p>Susan shook her head dejectedly; it had been a cruelly hard day at the factory
                    and the odors from the girls working on either side of her had all but
                    overwhelmed her. </p>
                <p>Old Tom nodded with stronger emphasis. "You're too young, yet," he said. "And not
                    licked into shape. But wait a while. You'll get there." </p>
               
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0365" n="342"/>
                <p>Susan hoped so, but doubted it. There was no time to work at these large problems
                    of destiny when the daily grind was so compelling, so wearing, when the problems
                    of bare food, clothing and shelter took all there was in her. </p>
                <p>For example, there was the matter of clothes. She had come with only what she was
                    wearing. She gave the Brashears every Saturday two dollars and a half of her
                    three and was ashamed of herself for taking so much for so little, when she
                    learned about the cost of living and how different was the food the Brashears
                    had from that of any other family in those quarters! As soon as she had saved
                    four dollars from her wages&mdash;it took nearly two months&mdash;she
                    bought the necessary materials and made herself two plain outer skirts, three
                    blouses and three pairs of drawers. Chemises and corset covers she could not
                    afford. She bought a pair of shoes for a dollar, two pairs of stockings for
                    thirty cents, a corset for eighty cents, an umbrella for half a dollar, two
                    underwaists for a quarter. She bought an untrimmed hat for thirty-five cents and
                    trimmed it with the cleaned ribbon from her summer sailor and a left over bit of
                    skirt material. She also made herself a jacket that had to serve as wrap
                    too&mdash;and the materials for this took the surplus of her wages for
                    another month. The cold weather had come, and she had to walk fast when she was
                    in the open air not to be chilled to the bone. Her Aunt Fanny had been one of
                    those women, not too common in America, who understand and practice genuine
                    economy in the household&mdash;not the shabby stinginess that passes for
                    economy but the laying out of money to the best advantage that comes only when
                    one knows values. This training stood Susan in good stead now. 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0366" n="343"/>
                    It saved her from
                    disaster&mdash;from disintegration. </p>
                <p>She and Etta did some washing every night, hanging the things on the fire escape
                    to dry. In this way she was able to be clean; but in appearance she looked as
                    poor as she was. She found a cobbler who kept her shoes in fair order for a few
                    cents; but nothing was right about them soon&mdash;except that they were not
                    down at the heel. She could recall how she had often wondered why the poor girls
                    at Sutherland showed so little taste, looked so dowdy. She wondered at her own
                    stupidity, at the narrowness of an education, such as hers had been, an
                    education that left her ignorant of the conditions of life as it was lived by
                    all but a lucky few of her fellow beings. </p>
                <p> How few the lucky! What an amazing world&mdash;what a strange creation the
                    human race! How was it possible that the lucky few, among whom she had been born
                    and bred, should know so little, really nothing, about the lot of the vast mass
                    of their fellows, living all around them, close up against them? "If I had only
                    known!" she thought. And then she reflected that, if she had known, pleasure
                    would have been impossible. She could see her bureau drawers, her closets at
                    home. She had thought herself not any too well off. Now, how luxurious, how
                    stuffed with shameful, wasteful unnecessaries those drawers and closets seemed! </p>
                <p>And merely to keep herself in underclothes that were at least not in tatters she
                    had to spend every cent over and above her board. If she had had to pay carfare
                    ten cents a day, sixty cents a week!&mdash;as did many of the girls who
                    lived at home, she would have been ruined. She understood now why every girl
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0367" n="344"/>
                    without a family back of her, and without good prospect of marriage, was
                    revolving the idea of becoming a streetwalker&mdash;not as a hope, but as a
                    fear. As she learned to observe more closely, she found good reasons for
                    suspecting that from time to time the girls who became too hard pressed relieved
                    the tension by taking to the streets on Saturday and Sunday nights. She read in
                    the _Commercial_ one noon&mdash;Mr. Matson sometimes left his paper where
                    she could glance through it&mdash;she read an article on working girls, how
                    they were seduced to lives of shame&mdash;by love of _finery_! Then she read
                    that those who did not fall were restrained by religion and innate purity. There
                    she laughed&mdash;bitterly. Fear of disease, fear of maternity, yes. But
                    where was this religion? Who but the dullest fools in the throes of that bare
                    and tortured life ever thought of God? As for the purity&mdash;what about
                    the obscene talk that made her shudder because of its sheer filthy
                    stupidity?&mdash;what about the frank shamelessness of the efforts to lure
                    their "steadies" into speedy matrimony by using every charm of caress and of
                    person to inflame passion without satisfying it? She had thought she knew about
                    the relations of the sexes when she came to live and work in that tenement
                    quarter. Soon her knowledge had seemed ignorance beside the knowledge of the
                    very babies. </p>
                <p>It was a sad, sad puzzle. If one ought to be good&mdash;chaste and clean in
                    mind and body&mdash;then, why was there the most tremendous pressure on all
                    but a few to make them as foul as the surroundings in which they were compelled
                    to live? If it was wiser to be good, then why were most people imprisoned in a
                    life from which they could escape only by being bad? What was this thing
                    comfortable people had set up 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0368" n="345"/>
                    as good, anyhow&mdash;and what was bad? She
                    found no answer. How could God condemn anyone for anything they did in the
                    torments of the hell that life revealed itself to her as being, after a few
                    weeks of its moral, mental and physical horrors? Etta's father was right; those
                    who realized what life really was and what it might be, those who were sensitive
                    took to drink or went to pieces some other way, if they were gentle, and if they
                    were cruel, committed any brutality, any crime to try to escape. </p>
                <p>In former days Susan thought well of charity, as she had been taught. Old Tom
                    Brashear gave her a different point of view. One day he insulted and drove from
                    the tenement some pious charitable people who had come down from the fashionable
                    hilltop to be good and gracious to their "less fashionable fellow-beings." After
                    they had gone he explained his harshness to Susan: </p>
                <p>"That's the only way you can make them slickedup brutes feel," said he, "they're
                    so thick in the hide and satisfied with themselves. What do they come here for!
                    To do good! Yes&mdash;to themselves. To make themselves feel how generous
                    and sweet they was. Well, they'd better go home and read their Russia-leather
                    covered Bibles. They'd find out that when God wanted to really do something for
                    man, he didn't have himself created a king, or a plutocrat, or a fat, slimy
                    church deacon in a fashionable church. No, he had himself born a bastard in a
                    manger." </p>
                <p>Susan shivered, for the truth thus put sounded like sacrilege. Then a
                    glow&mdash;a glow of pride and of hope&mdash;swept through her. </p>
                <p>"If you ever get up into another class," went on old Tom, "don't come hangin'
                    round the common people 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0369" n="346"/>
                    you'll be livin' off of and helpin' to grind down; stick
                    to your own class. That's the only place anybody can do any good&mdash;any
                    real helpin' and lovin', man to man, and woman to woman. If you want to help
                    anybody that's down, pull him up into your class first. Stick to your class.
                    You'll find plenty to do there." </p>
                <p>"What, for instance?" asked Susan. She understood a little of what he had in
                    mind, but was still puzzled. </p>
                <p>"Them stall-fed fakers I just threw out," the old man went on. "They come here,
                    actin' as if this was the Middle Ages and the lord of the castle was doin' a
                    fine thing when he went down among the low peasants who'd been made by God to
                    work for the lords. But this ain't the Middle Ages. What's the truth about it?" </p>
                <p>"I don't know," confessed Susan. </p>
                <p>"Why, the big lower class is poor because the little upper class takes away from
                    'em and eats up all they toil and slave to make. Oh, it ain't the upper class's
                    fault. They do it because they're ignorant more'n because they're bad, just as
                    what goes on down here is ignorance more'n badness. But they do it, all the
                    same. And they're ignorant and need to be told. Supposin' you saw a big girl out
                    yonder in the street beatin' her baby sister. What would you do? Would you go
                    and hold out little pieces of candy to the baby and say how sorry you was for
                    her? Or would you first grab hold of that big sister and throw her away from
                    beatin' of the baby?" </p>
                <p>"I see," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"That's it exactly," exclaimed the old man, in triumph. "And I say to them pious
                    charity fakers, `Git the hell out of here where you can't do no good. Git 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0370" n="347"/>
                    back
                    to yer own class that makes all this misery, makes it faster'n all the religion
                    and charity in the world could help it. Git back to yer own class and work with
                    them, and teach them and make them stop robbin' and beatin' the baby.'" </p>
                <p>"Yes," said the girl, "you are right. I see it now. But, Mr. Brashear, they meant
                    well." </p>
                <p>"The hell they did," retorted the old man. "If they'd, a' had love in their
                    hearts, they'd have seen the truth. Love's one of the greatest teachers in the
                    world. If they'd, a' meant well, they'd, a' been goin' round teachin' and
                    preachin' and prayin' at their friends and fathers and brothers, the plutocrats.
                    They'd never 'a' come down here, pretendin' they was doin' good, killin' one
                    bedbug out of ten million and offerin' one pair of good pants where a hundred
                    thousand pairs is needed. They'd better go read about themselves in their
                    Bible&mdash;what Jesus says. He knew 'em. _He_ belonged to
                    _us_&mdash;and _they_ crucified him." </p>
                <p>The horrors of that by no means lowest tenement region, its horrors for a girl
                    bred as Susan had been! Horrors moral, horrors mental, horrors
                    physical&mdash;above all, the physical horrors; for, worse to her than the
                    dull wits and the lack of education, worse than vile speech and gesture, was the
                    hopeless battle against dirt, against the vermin that could crawl
                    everywhere&mdash;and did. She envied the ignorant and the insensible their
                    lack of consciousness of their own plight&mdash;like the disemboweled horse
                    that eats tranquilly on. At first she had thought her unhappiness came from her
                    having been used to better things, that if she had been born to this life she
                    would have been content, gay at times. Soon she learned that laughter does not
                    always mean mirth; that the ignorant do not lack the power to 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0371" n="348"/>
                    suffer simply
                    because they lack the power to appreciate; that the diseases, the bent bodies,
                    the harrowed faces, the drunkenness, quarreling, fighting, were safer guides to
                    the real conditions of these people than their occasional guffaws and fits of
                    horseplay. </p>
                <p>A woman from the hilltop came in a carriage to see about a servant. On her way
                    through the hall she cried out: "Gracious! Why don't these lazy creatures clean
                    up, when soap costs so little and water nothing at all!" Susan heard, was moved
                    to face her fiercely, but restrained herself. Of what use? How could the woman
                    understand, if she heard, "But, you fool, where are we to get the time to clean
                    up?&mdash;and where the courage?&mdash;and would soap enough to clean up
                    and keep clean cost so little, when every penny means a drop of blood?" </p>
                <p>"If they only couldn't drink so much!" said Susan to Tom. </p>
                <p>"What, then?" retorted he. "Why, pretty soon wages'd be cut faster than they was
                    when street carfares went down from ten cents to five. Whenever the workin'
                    people arrange to live cheaper and to try to save something, down goes wages.
                    No, they might as well drink. It helps 'em bear it and winds 'em up sooner. I
                    tell you, it ain't the workin' people's fault&mdash;it's the bosses, now.
                    It's the system&mdash;the system. A new form of slavery, this here wage
                    system&mdash;and it's got to go&mdash;like the slaveholder that looked
                    so copper-riveted and Bible-backed in its day." </p>
                <p> That idea of "the system" was beyond Susan. But not what her eyes saw, and her
                    ears heard, and her nose smelled, and her sense of touch shrank from. No
                    ambition and no reason for ambition. No real knowledge, 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0372" n="349"/>
                    and no chance to get
                    any&mdash;neither the leisure nor the money nor the teachers. No hope, and
                    no reason for hope. No God&mdash;and no reason for a God. </p>
                <p>Ideas beyond her years, beyond her comprehension, were stirring in her brain,
                    were making her grave and thoughtful. She was accumulating a store of knowledge
                    about life; she was groping for the clew to its mystery, for the missing fact or
                    facts which would enable her to solve the puzzle, to see what its lessons were
                    for her. Sometimes her heavy heart told her that the mystery was plain and the
                    lesson easy&mdash;hopelessness. For of all the sadness about her, of all the
                    tragedies so sordid and unromantic, the most tragic was the hopelessness. It
                    would be impossible to conceive people worse off; it would be impossible to
                    conceive _these_ people better off. They were such a multitude that only they
                    could save themselves&mdash;and they had no intelligence to appreciate, no
                    desire to impel. If their miseries&mdash;miseries to which they had fallen
                    heir at birth&mdash;had made them what they were, it was also true that they
                    were what they were&mdash;hopeless, down to the babies playing in the filth.
                    An unscalable cliff; at the top, in pleasant lands, lived the comfortable
                    classes; at the bottom lived the masses&mdash;and while many came whirling
                    down from the top, how few found their way up! </p>
                <p>On a Saturday night Ashbel came home with the news that his wages had been cut to
                    seven dollars. And the restaurant had been paying steadily less as the hard
                    times grew harder and the cost of unadulterated and wholesome food mounted
                    higher and higher. As the family sat silent and stupefied, old Tom looked up
                    from his paper, fixed his keen, mocking eyes on Susan. </p>

                <p>"I see, here," said he, "that _we_ are so rich that they want to raise the
                    President's salary so as he can entertain _decently_&mdash;and to build
                    palaces at foreign courts so as our representatives'll live worthy of _us_!"

                <head> XX</head>
                <p> ON Monday at the lunch hour&mdash;or, rather, halfhour&mdash;Susan
                    ventured in to see the boss. </p>
                <p>Matson had too recently sprung from the working class and was too ignorant of
                    everything outside his business to have made radical changes in his habits. He
                    smoked five-cent cigars instead of "twofurs"; he ate larger quantities of food,
                    did not stint himself in beer or in treating his friends in the evenings down at
                    Wielert's beer garden. Also he wore a somewhat better quality of clothing; but
                    he looked precisely what he was. Like all the working class above the pauper
                    line, he made a Sunday toilet, the chief features of which were the weekly bath
                    and the weekly clean white shirt. Thus, it being only Monday morning, he was
                    looking notably clean when Susan entered&mdash;and was morally wound up to a
                    higher key than he would be as the week wore on. At sight of her his feet on the
                    leaf of the desk wavered, then became inert; it would not do to put on manners
                    with any of the "hands." Thanks to the bath, he was not exuding his usual odor
                    that comes from bolting much strong, cheap food. </p>
                <p>"Well, Lorny&mdash;what's the kick?" inquired he with his amiable grin. His
                    rise in the world never for an instant ceased to be a source of delight to him;
                    it&mdash;and a perfect digestion&mdash;kept him in a good humor all the
                    time. </p>
                <p>"I want to know," stammered Susan, "if you can't give me a little more money." </p>
               
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0375" n="352"/>
                <p>He laughed, eyeing her approvingly. Her clothing was that of the working girl;
                    but in her face was the look never found in those born to the modern form of
                    slavery-wage servitude. If he had been "cultured" he might have compared her to
                    an enslaved princess, though in fact that expression of her courageous
                    violet-gray eyes and sensitive mouth could never have been in the face of
                    princess bred to the enslaving routine of the most conventional of conventional
                    lives; it could come only from sheer erectness of spirit, the exclusive
                    birthright of the sons and daughters of democracy. </p>
                <p>"More money!" he chuckled. "You _have_ got a nerve!&mdash;when factories are
                    shutting down everywhere and working people are tramping the streets in droves." </p>
                <p>"I do about one-fourth more than the best hands you've got," replied Susan, made
                    audacious by necessity. "And I'll agree to throw in my lunch time." </p>
                <p>"Let me see, how much do you get?" </p>
                <p>"Three dollars." </p>
                <p>"And you aren't living at home. You must have a hard time. Not much over for
                    diamonds, eh? You want to hustle round and get married, Lorny. Looks don't last
                    long when a gal works. But you're holdin' out better'n them that gads and dances
                    all night." </p>
                <p>"I help at the restaurant in the evening to piece out my board. I'm pretty tired
                    when I get a chance to go to bed." </p>
                <p>"I'll bet!. . . So, you want more money. I've been watchin' you. I watch all my
                    gals&mdash;I have to, to keep weedin' out the fast ones. I won't have no bad
                    examples in _my_ place! As soon as I ketch a gal livin' beyond her wages I give
                    her the bounce." </p>
                <p>Susan lowered her eyes and her cheeks burned&mdash;not 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0376" n="353"/>
                    because Matson was
                    frankly discussing the frivolous subject of sex. Another girl might have
                    affected the air of distressed modesty, but it would have been affectation, pure
                    and simple, as in those regions all were used to hearing the frankest, vilest
                    things&mdash;and we do not blush at what we are used to hearing. Still, the
                    tenement female sex is as full of affectation as is the sex elsewhere. But,
                    Susan, the curiously self-unconscious, was incapable of affectation. Her
                    indignation arose from her sense of the hideous injustice of Matson's
                    discharging girls for doing what his meager wages all but compelled. </p>
                <p>"Yes, I've been watching you," he went on, "with a kind of a sort of a notion of
                    makin' you a forelady. That'd mean six dollars a week. But you ain't fit. You've
                    got the brains&mdash;plenty of 'em. But you wouldn't be of no use to me as
                    forelady." </p>
                <p>"Why not?" asked Susan. Six dollars a week! Affluence! Wealth! </p>
                <p>Matson took his feet down, relit his cigar and swung himself into an oracular
                    attitude. </p>
                <p>"I'll show you. What's manufacturin'? Right down at the bottom, I mean." He
                    looked hard at the girl. She looked receptively at him. </p>
                <p>"Why, it's gettin' work out of the hands. New ideas is nothin'. You can steal 'em
                    the minute the other fellow uses 'em. No, it's all in gettin' work out of the
                    hands." </p>
                <p>Susan's expression suggested one who sees light and wishes to see more of it. He
                    proceeded: </p>
                <p>"You work for me&mdash;for instance, now, if every day you make stuff there's
                    a profit of five dollars on, I get five dollars out of you. If I can push you to
                    make stuff there's a profit of six dollars on, I get six dollars
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0377" n="354"/>
                    &mdash;a dollar more. Clear extra gain, isn't it? Now multiply a dollar by the number of
                    hands, and you'll see what it amounts to." </p>
                <p>"I see," said Susan, nodding thoughtfully. </p>
                <p>"Well! How did I get up? Because as a foreman I knew how to work the hands. I
                    knew how to get those extra dollars. And how do I keep up? Because I hire
                    forepeople that get work out of the hands." </p>
                <p>Susan understood. But her expression was a comment that was not missed by the
                    shrewd Matson. </p>
                <p>"Now, listen to me, Lorny. I want to give you a plain straight talk because I'd
                    like to see you climb. Ever since you've been here I've been laughin' to myself
                    over the way your forelady&mdash;she's a fox, she is!&mdash;makes you
                    the pacemaker for the other girls. She squeezes at least twenty-five cents a day
                    over what she used to out of each hand in your room because you're above the
                    rest of them dirty, shiftless muttonheads." </p>
                <p>Susan flushed at this fling at her fellow-workers. </p>
                <p>"Dirty, shiftless muttonheads," repeated Matson. "Ain't I right? Ain't they
                    dirty? Ain't they shiftless&mdash;so no-account that if they wasn't watched
                    every minute they'd lay down&mdash;and let me and the factory that supports
                    'em go to rack and ruin? And ain't they muttonheads? Do you ever find any of 'em
                    saying or doing a sensible thing?" </p>
                <p>Susan could not deny. She could think of excuses&mdash;perfect excuses. But
                    the facts were about as he brutally put it. </p>
                <p>"Oh, I know 'em. I've dealt with 'em all my life," pursued the box manufacturer.
                    "Now, Lorny, you ought to be a forelady. You've got to toughen up and stop bein'
                    so polite and helpful and all that. 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0378" n="355"/>
                    You'll _never_ get on if you don't toughen
                    up. Business is business. Be as sentimental as you like away from business, and
                    after you've clum to the top. But not _in_ business or while you're kickin' and
                    scratchin' and clawin' your way up." </p>
                <p>Susan shook her head slowly. She felt painfully young and inexperienced and unfit
                    for the ferocious struggle called life. She felt deathly sick. </p>
                <p>"Of course it's a hard world," said Matson with a wave of his cigar. "But did I
                    make it?" </p>
                <p>"No," admitted Susan, as his eyes demanded a reply. </p>
                <p>"Sure not," said he. "And how's anybody to get up in it? Is there any other way
                    but by kickin' and stampin', eh?" </p>
                <p>"None that I see," conceded Susan reluctantly. </p>
                <p>"None that is," declared he. "Them that says there's other ways either lies or
                    don't know nothin' about the practical game. Well, then!" Matson puffed
                    triumphantly at the cigar. "Such bein' the case&mdash;and as long as the
                    crowd down below's got to be kicked in the face by them that's on the way up,
                    why shouldn't I do the kickin'&mdash;which is goin' to be done
                    anyhow&mdash;instead of gettin' kicked? Ain't that sense?" </p>
                <p>"Yes," admitted Susan. She sighed. "Yes," she repeated. </p>
                <p>"Well&mdash;toughen up. Meanwhile, I'll raise you, to spur the others on.
                    I'll give you four a week." And he cut short her thanks with an "Oh, don't
                    mention it. I'm only doin' what's square&mdash;what helps me as well as you.
                    I want to encourage you. You don't belong down among them cattle. Toughen up,
                    Lorny. A girl with a bank account gets the pick of the beaux." And he nodded a
                    dismissal. </p>
                <p>Matson, and his hands, bosses and workers, brutal, 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0379" n="356"/>
                    brutalizing each other more
                    and more as they acted and reacted upon each other. Where would it end? </p>
                <p>She was in dire need of underclothes. Her undershirts were full of holes from the
                    rubbing of her cheap, rough corset; her drawers and stockings were patched in
                    several places&mdash;in fact, she could not have worn the stockings had not
                    her skirt now been well below her shoetops. Also, her shoes, in spite of the
                    money she had spent upon them, were about to burst round the edges of the soles.
                    But she would not longer accept from the Brashears what she regarded as charity. </p>
                <p>"You more than pay your share, what with the work you do," protested Mrs.
                    Brashear. "I'll not refuse the extra dollar because I've simply got to take it.
                    But I don't want to pertend." </p>
                <p>The restaurant receipts began to fall with the increasing hardness of the times
                    among the working people. Soon it was down to practically no profit at
                    all&mdash;that is, nothing toward the rent. Tom Brashear was forced to
                    abandon his policy of honesty, to do as all the other purveyors were
                    doing&mdash;to buy cheap stuff and to cheapen it still further. He broke
                    abruptly with his tradition and his past. It aged him horribly all in a few
                    weeks&mdash;but, at least, ruin was put off. Mrs. Brashear had to draw
                    twenty of the sixty-three dollars which were in the savings bank against
                    sickness. Funerals would be taken care of by the burial insurance; each member
                    of the family, including Susan, had a policy. But sickness had to have its
                    special fund; and it was frequently drawn upon, as the Brashears knew no more
                    than their neighbors about hygiene, and were constantly catching the colds of
                    foolish exposure or indigestion and letting them develop into 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0380" n="357"/>
                    fevers, bad attacks of rheumatism, stomach trouble, backache all regarded by them as by
                    their neighbors as a necessary part of the routine of life. Those tenement
                    people had no more notion of self-restraint than had the "better classes" whose
                    self-indulgences maintain the vast army of doctors and druggists. The only thing
                    that saved Susan from all but an occasional cold or sore throat from wet feet
                    was eating little through being unable to accustom herself to the fare that was
                    the best the Brashears could now afford&mdash;cheap food in cheap lard,
                    coarse and poisonous sugar, vilely adulterated coffee, doctored meat and
                    vegetables&mdash;the food which the poor in their ignorance
                    buy&mdash;and for which they in their helplessness pay actually higher
                    prices than do intelligent well-to-do people for the better qualities. And not
                    only were the times hard, but the winter also.
                    Snow&mdash;sleet&mdash;rain&mdash;thaw&mdash;slush&mdash;noisome,
                    disease-laden vapor&mdash;and, of course, sickness everywhere&mdash;with
                    occasional relief in death, relief for the one who died, relief for the living
                    freed from just so much of the burden. The sickness on every hand appalled
                    Susan. Surely, she said to old Brashear, the like had never been before; on the
                    contrary, said he, the amount of illness and death was, if anything, less than
                    usual because the hard times gave people less for eating and drinking. These
                    ghastly creatures crawling toward the hospital or borne out on stretchers to the
                    ambulance&mdash;these yet ghastlier creatures tottering feebly homeward,
                    discharged as cured&mdash;these corpses of men, of women, of boys and girls,
                    of babies&mdash;oh, how many corpses of babies!&mdash;these corpses
                    borne away for burial, usually to the public burying ground&mdash;all these
                    stricken ones in the battle ever waging, with curses, with hoarse loud laughter,
                    with shrieks and moans, 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0381" n="358"/>
                    with dull, drawn faces and jaws set&mdash;all these
                    stricken ones were but the ordinary losses of the battle! </p>
                <p>"And in the churches," said old Tom Brashear, "they preach the goodness and mercy
                    of God. And in the papers they talk about how rich and prosperous we are." </p>
                <p>"I don't care to live! It is too horrible," cried the girl. </p>
                <p>"Oh, you mustn't take things so to heart," counseled he. "Us that live this life
                    can't afford to take it to heart. Leave that to them who come down here from the
                    good houses and look on us for a minute and enjoy themselves with a little
                    weepin' and sighin' as if it was in the theater." </p>
                <p>"It seems worse every, day," she said. "I try to fool myself, because I've got to
                    stay and&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Oh, no, you haven't," interrupted he. </p>
                <p>Susan looked at him with a startled expression. It seemed to her that the old man
                    had seen into her secret heart where was daily raging the struggle against
                    taking the only way out open to a girl in her circumstances. It seemed to her he
                    was hinting that she ought to take that way. </p>
                <p>If any such idea was in his mind, he did not dare put it into words. He simply
                    repeated: </p>
                <p>"You won't stay. You'll pull out." </p>
                <p>"How?" she asked. </p>
                <p>"Somehow. When the way opens you'll see it, and take it." </p>
                <p>There had long since sprung up between these two a sympathy, a mutual
                    understanding beyond any necessity of expression in words or looks. She had
                    never had this feeling for anyone, not even for Burlingham. This feeling for
                    each other had been like that of a 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0382" n="359"/>
                    father and daughter who love each other
                    without either understanding the other very well or feeling the need of a
                    sympathetic understanding. There was a strong resemblance between Burlingham and
                    old Tom. Both belonged to the familiar philosopher type. But, unlike the
                    actor-manager, the old cabinetmaker had lived his philosophy, and a very gentle
                    and tolerant philosophy it was. </p>
                <p>After she had looked her request for light upon what way she was to take, they
                    sat silent, neither looking at the other, yet each seeing the other with the eye
                    of the mind. She said: </p>
                <p>"I may not dare take it." </p>
                <p>"You won't have no choice," replied he. "You'll have to take it. And you'll get
                    away from here. And you mustn't ever come back&mdash;or look back. Forget
                    all this misery. Rememberin' won't do us no good. It'd only weaken you." </p>
                <p>"I shan't ever forget," cried the girl. </p>
                <p>"You must," said the old man firmly. He added, "And you will. You'll have too
                    much else to think about&mdash;too much that has to be attended to." </p>
                <p>As the first of the year approached and the small shopkeepers of the tenements,
                    like the big ones elsewhere, were casting up the year's balances and learning
                    how far toward or beyond the verge of ruin the hard times had brought them, the
                    sound of the fire engines&mdash;and of the ambulances&mdash;became a
                    familiar part of the daily and nightly noises of the district. Desperate
                    shopkeepers, careless of their neighbors' lives and property in fiercely
                    striving for themselves and their families&mdash;workingmen out of a job and
                    deep in debt&mdash;landlords with too heavy interest falling
                    due&mdash;all these were trying to save themselves or to lengthen the time
                   
                   
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0383" n="360"/>
                   the fact of ruin could be kept secret by setting fire to their shops or their
                    flats. The Brashears had been burned out twice in their wandering tenement house
                    life; so old Tom was sleeping little; was constantly prowling about the halls of
                    all the tenements in that row and into the cellars. </p>
                <p>He told Susan the open secret of the meaning of most of these fires. And after he
                    had cursed the fire fiends, he apologized for them. "It's the curse of the
                    system," explained he. "It's all the curse of the system. These here
                    storekeepers and the farmers the same way&mdash;they think they're
                    independent, but really they're nothin' but fooled slaves of the big blood
                    suckers for the upper class. But these here little storekeepers, they're tryin'
                    to escape. How does a man escape? Why, by gettin' some hands together to work
                    for him so that he can take it out of their wages. When you get together enough
                    to hire help&mdash;that's when you pass out of slavery into the master
                    class&mdash;master of slaves." </p>
                <p>Susan nodded understandingly. </p>
                <p>"Now, how can these little storekeepers like me get together enough to begin to
                    hire slaves? By a hundred tricks, every one of them wicked and mean. By skimpin'
                    and slavin' themselves and their families, by sellin' short weight, by sellin'
                    rotten food, by sellin' poison, by burnin' to get the insurance. And, at last,
                    if they don't die or get caught and jailed, they get together the money to
                    branch out and hire help, and begin to get prosperous out of the blood of their
                    help. These here arson fellows&mdash;they're on the first rung of the ladder
                    of success. You heard about that beautiful ladder in Sunday school, didn't you?" </p>
               
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0384" n="361"/>
                <p>"Yes," said Susan, "that and a great many other lies about God and man." </p>
                <p>Susan had all along had great difficulty in getting sleep because of the
                    incessant and discordant noises of the district. The unhappy people added to
                    their own misery by disturbing each other's rest&mdash;and no small part of
                    the bad health everywhere prevailing was due to this inability of anybody to get
                    proper sleep because somebody was always singing or quarreling, shouting or
                    stamping about. But Susan, being young and as yet untroubled by the indigestion
                    that openly or secretly preyed upon everyone else, did at last grow somewhat
                    used to noise, did contrive to get five or six hours of broken sleep. With the
                    epidemic of fires she was once more restless and wakeful. Every day came news of
                    fire somewhere in the tenement districts of the city, with one or more, perhaps
                    a dozen, roasted to death, or horribly burned. A few weeks, however, and even
                    that peril became so familiar that she slept like the rest. There were too many
                    actualities of discomfort, of misery, to harass her all day long every time her
                    mind wandered from her work. </p>
                <p>One night she was awakened by a scream. She leaped from bed to find the room
                    filling with smoke and the street bright as day, but with a flickering evil
                    light. Etta was screaming, Ashbel was bawling and roaring like a tortured bull.
                    Susan, completely dazed by the uproar, seized Etta and dragged her into the
                    hall. There were Mr. and Mrs. Brashear, he in his nightdress of drawers and
                    undershirt, she in the short flannel petticoat and sacque in which she always
                    slept. Ashbel burst out of his room, kicking the door down instead of turning
                    the knob. </p>
                <p>"Lorny," cried old Tom, "you take mother and Etta 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0385" n="362"/>
                    to the escape." And he rushed
                    at his powerful, stupid son and began to strike him in the face with his one
                    good fist, shrieking, "Shut up, you damn fool! Shut up!" </p>
                <p>Dragging Etta and pushing Mrs. Brashear, Susan moved toward the end of the hall
                    where the fire escape passed their windows. All the way down, the landings were
                    littered with bedding, pots, pans, drying clothes, fire wood, boxes, all manner
                    of rubbish, the overflow of the crowded little flats. Over these obstructions
                    and down the ladders were falling and stumbling men, women, children, babies, in
                    all degrees of nudity&mdash;for many of the big families that slept in one
                    room with windows tight shut so that the stove heat would not escape and be
                    wasted when fuel was so dear, slept stark naked. Susan contrived to get Etta and
                    the old woman to the street; not far behind them came Tom and Ashbel, the son's
                    face bleeding from the blows his father had struck to quiet him. </p>
                <p>It was a penetrating cold night, with an icy drizzle falling. The street was
                    filled with engines, hose, all manner of ruined household effects, firemen
                    shouting, the tenement people huddling this way and that, barefooted, nearly or
                    quite naked, silent, stupefied. Nobody had saved anything worth while. The
                    entire block was ablaze, was burning as if it had been saturated with coal oil. </p>
                <p>"The owner's done this," said old Tom. "I heard he was in trouble. But though
                    he's a church member and what they call a philanthropist, I hardly thought he'd
                    stoop to hirin' this done. If anybody's caught, it'll be some fellow that don't
                    know who he did it for." </p>
                <p>About a hundred families were homeless in the street. Half a dozen patrol wagons
                    and five ambulances were 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0386" n="363"/>
                    taking the people away to shelter, women and babies
                    first. It was an hour&mdash;an hour of standing in the street, with bare
                    feet on the ice, under the ankledeep slush&mdash;before old Tom and his wife
                    got their turn to be taken. Then Susan and Etta and Ashbel, escorted by a
                    policeman, set out for the station house. As they walked along, someone called
                    out to the policeman: </p>
                <p>"Anybody killed at the fire, officer?" </p>
                <p>"Six jumped and was smashed," replied the policeman. "I seen three dead babies.
                    But they won't know for several days how many it'll total." </p>
                <p>And all her life long, whenever Susan Lenox heard the clang of a fire engine,
                    there arose before her the memory picture of that fire, in all the horror of
                    detail. A fire bell to her meant wretched families flung into the night, shrieks
                    of mangled and dying, moans of babies with life oozing from their blue lips,
                    columns of smoke ascending through icy, soaking air, and a vast glare of wicked
                    light with flame demons leaping for joy in the measureless woe over which they
                    were presiding. As the little party was passing the fire lines, Ashbel's foot
                    slipped on a freezing ooze of blood and slush, and he fell sprawling upon a
                    human body battered and trampled until it was like an overturned basket of
                    butcher's odds and ends. </p>
                <p>The station house was eleven long squares away. But before they started for it
                    they were already at the lowest depth of physical wretchedness which human
                    nerves can register; thus, they arrived simply a little more numb. The big room,
                    heated by a huge, red-hot stove to the point where the sweat starts, was crowded
                    with abject and pitiful human specimens. Even Susan, the most sensitive person
                    there, gazed about with 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0387" n="364"/>
                    stolid eyes. The nakedness of unsightly bodies, gross
                    with fat or wasted to emaciation, the dirtiness of limbs and torsos long, long
                    unwashed, the foul steam from it all and from the water-soaked rags, the groans
                    of some, the silent, staring misery of others, and, most horrible of all, the
                    laughter of those who yielded like animals to the momentary sense of physical
                    well-being as the heat thawed them out&mdash;these sights and sounds
                    together made up a truly infernal picture. And, like all the tragedies of abject
                    poverty, it was wholly devoid of that dignity which is necessary to excite the
                    deep pity of respect, was sordid and squalid, moved the sensitive to turn away
                    in loathing rather than to advance with brotherly sympathy and love. </p>
                <p>Ashbel, his animal instinct roused by the sight of the stove, thrust the throng
                    aside rudely as he pushed straight for the radiating center. Etta and Susan
                    followed in his wake. The fierce heat soon roused them to the sense of their
                    plight. Ashbel began to curse, Etta to weep. Susan's mind was staring, without
                    hope but also without despair, at the walls of the trap in which they were all
                    caught&mdash;was seeking the spot where they could begin to burrow through
                    and escape. </p>
                <p>Beds and covers were gathered in by the police from everywhere in that district,
                    were ranged upon the floor of the four rooms. The men were put in the cells
                    downstairs; the women and the children got the cots. Susan and Etta lay upon the
                    same mattress, a horse blanket over them. Etta slept; Susan, wide awake, lived
                    in brain and nerves the heart-breaking scenes through which she had passed numb
                    and stolid. </p>
                <p>About six o'clock a breakfast of coffee, milk and bread was served. It was
                    evident that the police did not know what to do with these outcasts who had
                   
                   
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0388" n="365"/>
                   nothing and no place to go&mdash;for practically all were out of work when
                    the blow came. Ashbel demanded shoes, pants and a coat. </p>
                <p>"I've got to get to my job," shouted he, "or else I'll lose it. Then where in the
                    hell'd we be!" </p>
                <p>His blustering angered the sergeant, who finally told him if he did not quiet
                    down he would be locked in a cell. Susan interrupted, explained the situation,
                    got Ashbel the necessary clothes and freed Etta and herself of his worse than
                    useless presence. At Susan's suggestion such other men as had jobs were also
                    fitted out after a fashion and sent away. "You can take the addresses of their
                    families if you send them anywhere during the day, and these men can come back
                    here and find out where they've gone&mdash;" this was the plan she proposed
                    to the captain, and he adopted it. As soon as the morning papers were about the
                    city, aid of every kind began to pour in, with the result that before noon many
                    of the families were better established than they had been before the fire. </p>
                <p>Susan and Etta got some clothing, enough to keep them warm on their way through
                    the streets to the hospital to which Brashear and his wife had been taken. Mrs.
                    Brashear had died in the ambulance&mdash;of heart disease, the doctors said,
                    but Susan felt it was really of the sense that to go on living was impossible.
                    And fond of her though she was, she could not but be relieved that there was one
                    less factor in the unsolvable problem. </p>
                <p>"She's better, off" she said to Etta in the effort to console. </p>
                <p>But Etta needed no consolation. "Ever so much better off," she promptly assented.
                    "Mother hasn't cared about living since we had to give up our little 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0389" n="366"/>
                    home and
                    become tenement house people. And she was right." </p>
                <p>As to Brashear, they learned that he was ill; but they did not learn until
                    evening that he was dying of pneumonia. The two girls and Ashbel were admitted
                    to the ward where he lay&mdash;one of a long line of sufferers in bare,
                    clean little beds. Screens were drawn round his bed because he was dying. He had
                    been suffering torments from the savage assaults of the pneumonia; but the pain
                    had passed away now, so he said, though the dreadful sound of his breathing made
                    Susan's heart flutter and her whole body quiver. </p>
                <p>"Do you want a preacher or a priest?" asked the nurse. </p>
                <p>"Neither," replied the old man in gasps and whispers. "If there is a God he'll
                    never let anybody from this hell of a world into his presence. They might tell
                    him the truth about himself." </p>
                <p>"Oh, father, father!" pleaded Etta, and Ashbel burst into a fit of hysterical and
                    terrified crying. </p>
                <p>The old man turned his dying eyes on Susan. He rested a few minutes, fixing her
                    gaze upon his with a hypnotic stare. Then he began again: </p>
                <p>"You've got somethin' more'n a turnip on your shoulders. Listen to me. There was
                    a man named Jesus once"&mdash;gasp&mdash;gasp&mdash;"You've heard
                    about him, but you don't know about
                    him"&mdash;gasp&mdash;gasp&mdash;"I'll tell you&mdash;listen. He
                    was a low fellow&mdash;a workin' man&mdash;same trade as
                    mine&mdash;born without a father&mdash;born in a horse
                    trough&mdash;in a stable"&mdash;gasp&mdash;gasp&mdash; </p>
                <p>Susan leaned forward. "Born without a father," she murmured, her eyes suddenly
                    bright. </p>
                <p>"That's him. Listen"&mdash;gasp&mdash;gasp&mdash;gasp&mdash;"He
                    was a big feller&mdash;big brain&mdash;big heart&mdash;the biggest
                   
                   
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0390" n="367"/>
                   man that ever lived"&mdash;gasp&mdash;gasp&mdash;gasp&mdash;gas&mdash;"And
                    he looked at this here hell of a world from the outside, he being an outcast and
                    a low-down common workingman. And he _saw_&mdash;he did&mdash; </p>
                <p>"Yes, he saw!"&mdash;gasp&mdash;gasp&mdash;gasp&mdash;"And he
                    said all men were brothers&mdash;and that they'd find it out some day. He
                    saw that this world was put together for the strong and the cruel&mdash;that
                    they could win out&mdash;and make the rest of us work for 'em for what they
                    chose to give&mdash;like they work a poor ignorant horse for his feed and
                    stall in a dirty stable&mdash;"gasp&mdash;gasp&mdash;gasp&mdash; </p>
                <p>"For the strong and the cruel," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"And this feller Jesus&mdash;he set round the saloons and such
                    places&mdash;publicans, they called
                    'em"&mdash;gasp&mdash;gasp&mdash;gasp&mdash;"And he says to all
                    the poor ignorant slaves and such cattle, he says, `You're all brothers. Love
                    one another'"&mdash;gasp&mdash;gasp&mdash;gasp&mdash;" `Love one
                    another,' he says, `and learn to help each other and stand up for each other,'
                    he says, `and hate war and fightin' and money
                    grabbin'&mdash;'"gasp&mdash;gasp&mdash;gasp&mdash;"`Peace on
                    earth,' he says, `Know the truth, and the truth shall make you
                    free'&mdash;and he saw there'd be a time"&mdash;the old man raised
                    himself on one elbow&mdash;"Yes, by God&mdash;there _will_
                    be!&mdash;a time when men'll learn not to be beasts and'll be
                    men&mdash;_men_, little gal!" </p>
                <p>"Men," echoed Susan, her eyes shining, her bosom heaving. </p>
                <p>"It ain't sense and it ain't right that everything should be for the
                    few&mdash;for them with brains&mdash;and that the rest&mdash;the
                    millions&mdash;should be tramped down just because they ain't so cruel or so
                    `cute'&mdash;they and their children tramped down in the dirt. And that
                    feller Jesus saw it." </p>
               
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0391" n="368"/>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;yes," cried Susan. "He saw it." </p>
                <p>"I'll tell you what he was," said old Tom in a hoarse whisper. "He wasn't no god.
                    He was bigger'n that&mdash;bigger'n that, little gal! He was the first _man_
                    that ever lived. He said, `Give the weak a chance so as they kin git strong.' He
                    says&mdash;" </p>
                <p>The dying man fell back exhausted. His eyes rolled wildly, closed; his mouth
                    twitched, fell wide open; there came from his throat a sound Susan had never
                    heard before, but she knew what it was, what it meant. </p>
                <p>Etta and Ashbel were overwhelmed afresh by the disgrace of having their parents
                    buried in Potter's Field&mdash;for the insurance money went for debts. They
                    did not understand when Susan said, "I think your father'd have liked to feel
                    that he was going to be buried there&mdash;because then he'll be
                    with&mdash;with his Friend. You know, _He_ was buried in Potter's Field."
                    However, their grief was shortlived; there is no time in the lives of working
                    people for such luxuries as grief&mdash;no more time than there is at sea
                    when all are toiling to keep afloat the storm-racked sinking ship and one sailor
                    is swept overboard. In comfortable lives a bereavement is a contrast; in the
                    lives of the wretched it is but one more in the assailing army of woes. </p>
                <p>Etta took a job at the box factory at three dollars a week; she and Susan and
                    Ashbel moved into two small rooms in a flat in a tenement opposite the
                    factory&mdash;a cheaper and therefore lower house than the one that had
                    burned. They bought on the installment plan nine dollars' worth of
                    furniture&mdash;the scant minimum of necessities. They calculated that, by
                    careful saving, they could pay off the debt in a year or so&mdash;unless one
                    or the other fell ill or lost work. "That 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0392" n="369"/>
                    means," said Etta, eyeing their flimsy
                    and all but downright worthless purchases, "that means we'll still be paying
                    when this furniture'll be gone to pieces and fit only for kindling." </p>
                <p>"It's the best we can do," replied Susan. "Maybe one of us'll get a better job." </p>
                <p>"_You_ could, I'm sure, if you had the clothes," said Etta. "But not in those
                    rags." </p>
                <p>"If I had the clothes? Where?" </p>
                <p>"At Shillito's or one of the other department stores. They'd give us both places
                    in one of the men's departments. They like pretty girls for those
                    places&mdash;if they're not giddy and don't waste time flirting but use
                    flirtation to sell goods. But what's the sense in talking about it? You haven't
                    got the clothes. A saleslady's got to be counter-dressed. She can look as bad as
                    she pleases round the skirt and the feet. But from the waist up she has to look
                    natty, if she wants wages." </p>
                <p>Susan had seen these girls; she understood now why they looked as if they were
                    the put together upper and lower halves of two different persons. She recalled
                    that, even though they went into other business, they still retained the habit,
                    wore toilets that were counterbuilt. She revolved the problem of getting one of
                    these toilets and of securing a store job. But she soon saw it was hopeless, for
                    the time. Every cent the three had was needed to keep from starving and
                    freezing. Also&mdash;though she did not realize it&mdash;her young
                    enthusiasm was steadily being sapped by the life she was leading. It may have
                    been this rather than natural gentleness&mdash;or perhaps it was as much the
                    one as the other&mdash;that kept Susan from taking Matson's advice and
                    hardening herself into a forelady. 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0393" n="370"/>
                    The ruddy glow under her skin had given place
                    to, the roundness of her form had gone, and its pallor; beauty remained only
                    because she had a figure which not even emaciation could have deprived of lines
                    of alluring grace. But she was no longer quite so straight, and her hair, which
                    it was a sheer impossibility to care for, was losing its soft vitality. She was
                    still pretty, but not the beauty she had been when she was ejected from the
                    class in which she was bred. However, she gave the change in herself little
                    thought; it was the rapid decline of Etta's prettiness and freshness that
                    worried her most. </p>
                <p>Not many weeks after the fire and the deeper plunge, she began to be annoyed by
                    Ashbel. In his clumsy, clownish way he was making advances to her. Several times
                    he tried to kiss her. Once, when Etta was out, he opened the door of the room
                    where she was taking a bath in a washtub she had borrowed of the janitress,
                    leered in at her and very reluctantly obeyed her sharp order to close the door.
                    She had long known that he was in reality very different from the silent
                    restrained person fear of his father made him seem to be. But she thought even
                    the reality was far above the rest of the young men growing up among those
                    degrading influences. </p>
                <p>The intrusion into her room was on a Sunday; on the following Sunday he came back
                    as soon as Etta went out. "Look here, Lorny," said he, with blustering tone and
                    gesture, "I want to have a plain talk with you. I'm sick and tired of this.
                    There's got to be a change." </p>
                <p>"Sick of what?" asked Susan. </p>
                <p>"Of the way you stand me off." He plumped himself sullenly down on the edge of
                    hers and Etta's bed. 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0394" n="371"/>
                    "I can't afford to get married. I've got to stick by you
                    two." </p>
                <p>"It strikes me, Ashbel, we all need each other. Who'd marry you on seven a week?"
                    She laughed good-humoredly. "Anyhow, _you_ wouldn't support a wife. It takes the
                    hardest kind of work to get your share of the expenses out of you. You always
                    try to beat us down to letting you off with two fifty a week." </p>
                <p>"That's about all Etta pays." </p>
                <p>"It's about all she gets. And __I__ pay three fifty&mdash;and she and I do
                    all the work&mdash;and give you two meals and a lunch to take with
                    you&mdash;and you've got a room alone&mdash;and your mending done. I
                    guess you know when you're well off." </p>
                <p>"But I ain't well off," he cried. "I'm a grown-up man&mdash;and I've got to
                    have a woman." </p>
                <p>Susan had become used to tenement conditions. She said, practically,
                    "Well&mdash;there's your left over four dollars a week." </p>
                <p>"Huh!" retorted he. "Think I'm goin' to run any risks? I'm no fool. I take care
                    of my health." </p>
                <p>"Well&mdash;don't bother me with your troubles&mdash;at least, troubles
                    of that sort." </p>
                <p>"Yes, but I will!" shouted he, in one of those sudden furies that seize upon the
                    stupid ignorant. "You needn't act so nifty with me. I'm as good as you are. I'm
                    willing to marry you." </p>
                <p>"No, thanks," said Susan. "I'm not free to marry&mdash;even if I would." </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;you ain't?" For an instant his curiosity, as she thus laid a hand
                    upon the curtain over her past, distracted his uncertain attention. But her
                    expression, reserved, cold, maddeningly reminding him of a class distinction of
                    which he was as sensitively conscious 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0395" n="372"/>
                    as she was unconscious&mdash;her
                    expression brought him back with a jerk. "Then you'll have to live with me,
                    anyhow. I can't stand it, and I'm not goin' to. </p>
                <p>If you want me to stay on here, and help out, you've got to treat me right. Other
                    fellows that do as I'm doing get treated right. And I've got to be,
                    too&mdash;or I'll clear out." And he squirmed, and waggled his head and
                    slapped and rubbed his heavy, powerful legs. </p>
                <p>"Why, Ashbel," said Susan, patting him on the shoulder. "You and I are like
                    brother and sister. You might as well talk this way to Etta." </p>
                <p>He gave her a brazen look, uttered a laugh that was like the flinging out of a
                    bucket of filth. "Why not? Other fellows that have to support the family and
                    can't afford to marry gets took care of." Susan shrank away. But Ashbel did not
                    notice it. "It ain't a question of Etta," he went on. "There's you&mdash;and
                    I don't need to look nowhere else." </p>
                <p>Susan had long since lost power to be shocked by any revelation of the doings of
                    people lashed out of all civilized feelings by the incessant brutal whips of
                    poverty and driven back to the state of nature. She had never happened to hear
                    definitely of this habit&mdash;even custom&mdash;of incestuous
                    relations; now that she heard, she instantly accepted it as something of which
                    she had really known for some time. At any rate, she had no sense of shock. She
                    felt no horror, no deep disgust, simply the distaste into which her original
                    sense of horror had been thinned down by constant contact with poverty's
                    conditions&mdash;just as filth no longer made her shudder, so long as it did
                    not touch her own person. </p>
                <p>"You'd better go and chase yourself round the 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0396" n="373"/>
                    square a few times," said she,
                    turning away and taking up some mending. </p>
                <p>"You see, there ain't no way out of it," pursued he, with an insinuating grin. </p>
                <p>Susan gave him a steady, straight look. "Don't ever speak of it again," said she
                    quietly. "You ought to be ashamed&mdash;and you will be when you think it
                    over." </p>
                <p>He laughed loudly. "I've thought it over. I mean what I say. If you don't do the
                    square thing by me, you drive me out." </p>
                <p>He came hulking up to her, tried to catch her in his big powerful arms. She put
                    the table between him and her. He kicked it aside and came on. She saw that her
                    move had given him a false impression&mdash;a notion that she was afraid of
                    him, was coquetting with him. She opened the door leading into the front part of
                    the flat where the Quinlan family lived. "If you don't behave yourself, I'll
                    call Mr. Quinlan," said she, not the least bluster or fear or nervousness in her
                    tone. </p>
                <p>"What'd be the use? He'd only laugh. Why, the same thing's going on in their
                    family." </p>
                <p>"Still, he'd lynch you if I told him what _you_ were trying to do." </p>
                <p>Even Ashbel saw this familiar truth of human nature. The fact that Quinlan was
                    guilty himself, far from staying him from meting out savage justice to another,
                    would make him the more relentless and eager. "All right," said he. "Then you
                    want me to git out?" </p>
                <p>"I want you to behave yourself and stay on. Go take a walk, Ashbel." </p>
                <p>And Ashbel went. But his expression was not reassuring; Susan feared he had no
                    intention of accepting 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0397" n="374"/>
                    his defeat. However, she reasoned that numbskull though
                    he was, he yet had wit enough to realize how greatly to his disadvantage any
                    change he could make would be. She did not speak of the matter to Etta, who was
                    therefore taken completely by surprise when Ashbel, after a silent supper that
                    evening, burst out with his grievance: </p>
                <p>"I'm going to pack up," said he. "I've found a place where I'll be treated
                    right." He looked haughtily at Susan. "And the daughter's a good looker, too.
                    She's got some weight on her. She ain't like a washed out string." </p>
                <p>Etta understood at once. "What a low-down thing you are!" she cried. "Just like
                    the rest of these filthy tenement house animals. I thought _you_ had some
                    pride." </p>
                <p>"Oh, shut up!" bawled Ashbel. "You're not such a much. What're we, anyhow, to put
                    on airs? We're as common as dirt&mdash;yes, and that sniffy lady friend of
                    yours, too. Where'd she come from, anyhow? Some dung pile, I'll bet." </p>
                <p>He went into his room, reappeared with his few belongings done into a bundle. "So
                    long," said he, stalking toward the hall door. </p>
                <p>Etta burst into tears, caught him by the arm. "You ain't goin', are you, Ashy?"
                    cried she. </p>
                <p>"Bet your life. Let me loose." And he shook her off. "I'm not goin' to be saddled
                    with two women that ain't got no gratitude." </p>
                <p>"My God, Lorna!" wailed Etta. "Talk to him. Make him stay." </p>
                <p>Susan shook her head, went to the window and gazed into the snowy dreary prospect
                    of tenement house yards. Ashbel, who had been hesitating through hope, 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0398" n="375"/>
                    vented a
                    jeering laugh. "Ain't she the insultin'est, airiest lady!" sneered he. "Well, so
                    long." </p>
                <p>"But, Ashy, you haven't paid for last week yet," pleaded Etta, clinging to his
                    arm. </p>
                <p>"You kin have my share of the furniture for that." </p>
                <p>"The furniture! Oh, my God!" shrieked Etta, releasing him to throw out her arms
                    in despair. "How'll we pay for the furniture if you go?" </p>
                <p>"Ask your high and mighty lady friend," said her brother. And he opened the door,
                    passed into the hall, slammed it behind him. Susan waited a moment for Etta to
                    speak, then turned to see what she was doing. She had dropped into one of the
                    flimsy chairs, was staring into vacancy. </p>
                <p>"We'll have to give up these rooms right away," said Susan. </p>
                <p>Etta roused herself, looked at her friend. And Susan saw what Etta had not the
                    courage to express&mdash;that she blamed her for not having "made the best
                    of it" and kept Ashbel. And Susan was by no means sure that the reproach in
                    Etta's eyes and heart were not justified. "I couldn't do it, Etta," she said
                    with a faint suggestion of apology. </p>
                <p>"Men are that way," said Etta sullenly. </p>
                <p>"Oh, I don't blame him," protested Susan. "I understand. But&mdash;I can't do
                    it, Etta&mdash;I simply can't!" </p>
                <p>"No," said Etta. "You couldn't. I could, but you couldn't. I'm not as far down as
                    Ashbel. I'm betwixt and between; so I can understand you both." </p>
                <p>"You go and make up with him and let me look after myself. I'll get along." </p>
                <p>Etta shook her head. "No," said she without any show of sentiment, but like one
                    stating an unalterable fact. "I've got to stay on with you. 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0399" n="376"/>
                    I can't live without
                    you. I don't want to go down. I want to go up." </p>
                <p>"Up!" Susan smiled bitterly. </p>
                <p>Silence fell between them, and Susan planned for the new conditions. She did not
                    speak until Etta said, "What ever will we do?" </p>
                <p>"We've got to give up the furniture. Thank goodness, we've paid only two-fifty on
                    it." </p>
                <p>"Yes, _it's_ got to go," said Etta. </p>
                <p>"And we've got to pay Mrs. Quinlan the six we owe her and get out tonight. We'll
                    go up to the top floor&mdash;up to Mrs. Cassatt. She takes sleepers.
                    Then&mdash;we'll see." </p>
                <p>An hour later they had moved; for Mrs. Quinlan was able to find two lodgers to
                    take the rooms at once. They were established with Mrs. Cassatt, had a foul and
                    foul-smelling bed and one-half of her back room; the other half barely contained
                    two even dirtier and more malodorous cots, in one of which slept Mrs. Cassatt's
                    sixteen-year-old daughter Kate, in the other her fourteen-year-old son Dan. For
                    these new quarters and the right to cook their food on the Cassatt stove the
                    girls agreed to pay three dollars and a half a week&mdash;which left them
                    three dollars and a half a week for food and clothing&mdash;and for
                    recreation and for the exercise of the virtue of thrift which the comfortable so
                    assiduously urge upon the poor. </p>

                <head> XXI</head>
                <p> EACH girl now had with her at all times everything she possessed in the
                    world&mdash;a toothbrush, a cake of castile soap, the little money left out
                    of the week's wages, these three items in the pocket of her one skirt, a cheap
                    dark blue cloth much wrinkled and patched; a twenty-five cent felt hat, Susan's
                    adorned with a blue ribbon, Etta's with a bunch of faded roses; a blue cotton
                    blouse patched under the arms with stuff of a different shade; an old misshapen
                    corset that cost forty-nine cents in a bargain sale; a suit of gray
                    shoddy-and-wool underwear; a pair of fifteen-cent stockings, Susan's brown,
                    Etta's black; a pair of worn and torn ties, scuffed and down at the heel, bought
                    for a dollar and nine cents; a dirt-stained dark blue jacket, Susan's lacking
                    one button, Etta's lacking three and having a patch under the right arm. </p>
                <p>Yet they often laughed and joked with each other, with their fellow-workers. You
                    might have said their hearts were light; for so eager are we to believe our
                    fellow-beings comfortable, a smile of poverty's face convinces us straightway
                    that it is as happy as we, if not happier. There would have been to their mirth
                    a little more than mere surface and youthful ability to find some jest in the
                    most crushing tragedy if only they could have kept themselves clean. The lack of
                    sufficient food was a severe trial, for both had voracious appetites; Etta was
                    tormented by visions of quantity, Susan by visions of quality as well as of
                    quantity. But only at meal times, or when they 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0401" n="378"/>
                    had to omit a meal entirely, were
                    they keenly distressed by the food question. The cold was a still severer trial;
                    but it was warm in the factory and it was warm in Mrs. Cassatt's flat, whose
                    windows were never opened from closing in of winter until spring came round. The
                    inability to keep clean was the trial of trials. </p>
                <p>From her beginning at the box factory the physical uncleanness of the other girls
                    had made Susan suffer keenly. And her suffering can be understood only by a
                    clean person who has been through the same ordeal. She knew that her
                    fellow-workers were not to blame. She even envied them the ignorance and the
                    insensibility that enabled them to bear what, she was convinced, could never be
                    changed. She wondered sometimes at the strength and grip of the religious belief
                    among the girls&mdash;even, or, rather, especially, among those who had
                    strayed from virtue into the path their priests and preachers and rabbis told
                    them was the most sinful of all strayings. But she also saw many signs that
                    religion was fast losing its hold. One day a Lutheran girl, Emma Schmeltz, said
                    during a Monday morning lunch talk: </p>
                <p>"Well, anyhow, I believe it's all a probation, and everything'll be made right
                    hereafter. __I__ believe my religion, I do. Yes, we'll be rewarded in the
                    hereafter." </p>
                <p>Becky&mdash;Rebecca Lichtenspiel&mdash;laughed, as did most of the girls.
                    Said Becky: </p>
                <p>"And there ain't no hereafter. Did you ever see a corpse? Ain't they the dead
                    ones! Don't talk to me about no hereafter." </p>
                <p>Everybody laughed. But this was a Monday morning conversation, high above the
                    average of the girls' talk in intelligence and liveliness. Their minds had been
                    
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0402" n="379"/>
                    stimulated by the Sunday rest from the dreary and degenerating drudgery of
                    "honest toil." </p>
                <p>It was the physical contacts that most preyed upon Susan. She was too gentle, too
                    considerate to show her feelings; in her determined and successful effort to
                    conceal them she at times went to the opposite extreme and not only endured but
                    even courted contacts that were little short of loathsome. Tongue could not tell
                    what she suffered through the persistent affectionateness of Letty Southard, a
                    sweet and pretty young girl of wretchedly poor family who developed an enormous
                    liking for her. Letty, dirty and clad in noisome undergarments beneath soiled
                    rags and patches, was always hugging and kissing her&mdash;and not to have
                    submitted would have been to stab poor Letty to the heart and humiliate all the
                    other girls. So no one, not even Etta, suspected what she was going through. </p>
                <p>From her coming to the factory in the morning, to hang her hat and jacket in the
                    only possible place, along with the soiled and smelling and often
                    vermin-infected wraps of the others&mdash;from early morning until she left
                    at night she was forced into contacts to which custom never in the least blunted
                    her. However, so long as she had a home with the Brashears there was the nightly
                    respite. But now&mdash; </p>
                <p>There was little water, and only a cracked and filthy basin to wash in. There was
                    no chance to do laundry work; for their underclothes must be used as night
                    clothes also. To wash their hair was impossible. </p>
                <p>"Does my hair smell as bad as yours?" said Etta. "You needn't think yours is
                    clean because it doesn't show the dirt like mine." </p>
                <p>"Does my hair smell as bad as the rest of the girls'?" said Susan. </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0403" n="380"/>
                <p>"Not quite," was Etta's consoling reply. </p>
                <p>By making desperate efforts they contrived partially to wash their bodies once a
                    week, not without interruptions of privacy&mdash;to which, however, they
                    soon grew accustomed. In spite of efforts which were literally heroic, they
                    could not always keep free from parasites; for the whole tenement and all
                    persons and things in it were infected&mdash;and how could it be otherwise
                    where no one had time or money or any effective means whatsoever to combat
                    nature's inflexible determination to breed wherever there is a breeding spot?
                    The last traces of civilization were slipping from the two girls; they were
                    sinking to a state of nature. </p>
                <p>Even personal pride, powerful in Susan and strong in Etta through Susan's
                    example, was deserting them. They no longer minded Dan's sleeping in their room.
                    They saw him, his father, the other members of the family in all stages of
                    nudity and at the most private acts; and they were seen by the Cassatts in the
                    same way. To avoid this was impossible, as impossible as to avoid the parasites
                    swarming in the bed, in the woodwork, in cracks of ceiling, walls, floor. </p>
                <p>The Cassatts were an example of how much the people who live in the sheltered and
                    more or less sunny nooks owe to their shelter and how little to their own
                    boasted superiority of mind and soul. They had been a high class artisan family
                    until a few months before. The hard times struck them a series of quick, savage
                    blows, such as are commonplace enough under our social system, intricate because
                    a crude jumble of makeshifts, and easily disordered because intricate. They were
                    swept without a breathing pause down to the bottom. Those who have always been
                    accustomed to prosperity have no reserve of experience or courage 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0404" n="381"/>
                    to enable them
                    to recuperate from sudden and extreme adversity. In an amazingly short time the
                    Cassatts had become demoralized&mdash;a familiar illustration of how
                    civilization is merely a wafer-thin veneer over most human beings as yet. Over
                    how many is it more? They fought after a fashion; they fought valiantly. But how
                    would it have been possible not steadily to yield ground against such a
                    pitiless, powerful foe as poverty? The man had taken to drink, to blunt outraged
                    self-respect and to numb his despair before the spectacle of his family's
                    downfall. Mrs. Cassatt was as poor a manager as the average woman in whatever
                    walk of life, thanks to the habit of educating woman in the most slipshod
                    fashion, if at all, in any other part of the business but sex-trickery. Thus she
                    was helpless before the tenement conditions. She gave up, went soddenly about in
                    rags with an incredibly greasy and usually dangling tail of hair. </p>
                <p>"Why don't you tie up that tail, ma?" said the son Dan, who had ideas about
                    neatness. </p>
                <p>"What's the use?" said Mrs. Cassatt. "What's the use of _anything_?" </p>
                <p>"Ma don't want to look stylish and stuck up," said the daughter. </p>
                <p>Mrs. Cassatt's haunting terror was lest someone who had known them in the days of
                    their prosperity with a decently furnished little house of their own should run
                    into one of the family now. </p>
                <p>Kate, the sixteen-year-old had a place as saleslady in a big shop in Fifth,
                    Street; her six dollars a week was the family's entire steady income. She had
                    formerly possessed a good deal of finery for a girl in her position, though
                    really not much more than the daughter of the average prosperous artisan or
                    
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0405" n="382"/>
                    small shopkeeper expects, and is expected, to have. Being at the shop where
                    finery was all the talk and sight and thought from opening until closing had
                    developed in her a greedy taste for luxury. She pilfered from the stocks of
                    goods within her reach and exchanged her stealings for the stealings of girls
                    who happened to be able to get things more to her liking or need. But now that
                    the family savings&mdash;bank account was exhausted, all these pilferings
                    had to go at once to the pawnshop. Kate grew more and more ill-tempered as the
                    family sank. Formerly she had been noted for her amiability, for her vanity
                    easily pleased with a careless compliment from no matter whom&mdash;a
                    jocose, half-drunken ash man, half-jeering, half-admiring from his cart seat
                    quite as satisfactory as anybody. But poverty was bringing out in her all those
                    meanest and most selfish and most brutish instincts&mdash;those primal
                    instincts of human nature that civilization has slowly been subjecting to the
                    process of atrophy which has lost us such other primal attributes as, for
                    example, prehensile toes and a covering of hair. </p>
                <p>"Well, I for one don't have to stay in this slop barrel," Kate was always saying.
                    "Some fine morning I'll turn up missing&mdash;and you'll see me in my own
                    turnout." </p>
                <p>She was torturing her mother and father with the dread that she would leave the
                    family in the lurch and enter a house of prostitution. She recounted with the
                    utmost detail how the madam of a house in Longworth Street came from time to
                    time to her counter in the perfumery and soap department&mdash;and urged her
                    to "stop making a fool of yourself and come get good money for your looks before
                    you lose 'em drudging

                    behind a counter." The idea grew less abhorrent, took on
                    allurement as the degradation of tenement life ate out respect for conventional
                    restraints&mdash;for modesty, for virtue, for cleanness of speech, and the
                    rest. More and more boldly Kate was announcing that she wasn't going to be a
                    fool much longer. </p>
                <p>Dan, the fourteen-year-old boy, had attracted the attention of what Cassatt
                    called "a fancy lady" who lived two floors below them. She made sometimes as
                    much as nine or ten dollars a week and slept all day or lounged comfortably
                    about in showy, tawdry stuff that in those surroundings seemed elegant luxury.
                    She was caught by the boy's young beauty and strength, and was rapidly training
                    him in every vice and was fitting him to become a professional seducer and
                    "lover." </p>
                <p>Said Mrs. Cassatt in one of her noisy wailing appeals to Dan: </p>
                <p>"You better keep away from that there soiled dove. They tell me she's a
                    thief&mdash;has done time&mdash;has robbed drunken men in dark
                    hallways." </p>
                <p>Dan laughed impudently. "She's a cute one. What diff does it make how she gets
                    the goods as long as she gets it?" </p>
                <p>Mrs. Cassatt confided to everybody that she was afraid the woman would make a
                    thief of her boy&mdash;and there was no disputing the justice of her
                    forebodings. </p>
                <p>Foul smells and sights everywhere, and foul language; no privacy, no possibility
                    of modesty where all must do all in the same room: vermin, parasites, bad food
                    vilely cooked&mdash;in the midst of these and a multitude of similar ills
                    how was it possible to maintain a human standard, even if one had by chance
                    acquired 
                    
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0407" n="384"/> 
                   a knowledge of what constituted a human standard? The Cassatts were
                    sinking into the slime in which their neighbors were already wallowing. But
                    there was this difference. For the Cassatts it was a descent; for many of their
                    neighbors it was an ascent&mdash;for the immigrants notably, who had been
                    worse off in their European homes; in this land not yet completely in the grip
                    of the capitalist or wage system they were now getting the first notions of
                    decency and development, the first views and hope of rising in the world. The
                    Cassatts, though they had always lived too near the slime to be nauseated by it,
                    still found it disagreeable and in spots disgusting. Their neighbors&mdash; </p>
                <p>One of the chief reasons why these people were rising so slowly where they were
                    rising at all was that the slime seemed to them natural, and to try to get clean
                    of it seemed rather a foolish, finicky waste of time and effort. People who have
                    come up&mdash;by accident, or by their own force, or by the force of some at
                    once shrewd and brutal member of the family&mdash;have to be far and long
                    from the slums before they lose the sense that in conforming to the decencies of
                    life they are making absurd effeminate concessions. When they go to buy a
                    toothbrush they blush and stammer. </p>
                <p>"Look at Lorna and Etta," Mrs. Cassatt was always saying to Kate. </p>
                <p>"Well, I see 'em," Kate would reply. "And I don't see much." </p>
                <p>"Ain't you ashamed of yourself!" cried the mother. "Them two lives straight and
                    decent. And you're better off than they are." </p>
                <p>"Don't preach to me, ma," sneered Kate. "When I get ready I'll&mdash;stop
                    making a damn fool of myself." </p>
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0408" n="385"/>
                <p>But the example of the two girls was not without its effect. They, struggling on
                    in chastity against appalling odds, became the models, not only to Mrs. Cassatt,
                    but all the mothers of that row held up to their daughters. The
                    mothers&mdash;all of them by observation, not a few by
                    experience&mdash;knew what the "fancy lady's" life really meant. And they
                    strove mightily to keep their daughters from it. Not through religion or moral
                    feeling, though many pretended&mdash;perhaps fancied&mdash;that this was
                    their reason; but through the plainest kind of practical sense&mdash;the
                    kind that in the broad determines the actions of human beings of whatever class,
                    however lofty the idealistic pretenses may be. These mothers knew that the
                    profession of the pariah meant a short life and a wretched one, meant disease,
                    lower and ever lower wages, the scale swiftly descending, meant all the miseries
                    of respectability plus a heavy burden of miseries of its own. There were many
                    other girls besides Susan and Etta holding up their heads&mdash;girls with
                    prospects of matrimony, girls with fairly good wages, girls with fathers and
                    brothers at work and able to provide a home. But Susan and Etta were peculiarly
                    valuable as examples because they were making the fight alone and unaided. </p>
                <p>Thus, they were watched closely. In those neighborhoods everyone knows everyone's
                    else business down to how the last cent is got and spent. If either girl had
                    appeared in a new pair of shoes, a new hat, a new garment of any kind, at once
                    the report would have sped that the wearer had taken a turn in the streets. And
                    the scandal would have been justified; for where could either have respectably
                    got the money for the smallest and cheapest addition to her toilet? Matson, too,
                    proudly pointed them out as giving the 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0409" n="386"/>
                    lie to the talk about working girls not
                    getting living wages, to the muttering against him and his fellow employers as
                    practically procurers for the pavement and the dive, for the charity hospital's
                    most dreadful wards, for the Morgue's most piteous boxes and slabs. </p>
                <p>As their strength declined, as their miseries ate in and in, the two girls ceased
                    talking together; they used to chatter much of the time like two birds on a
                    leafy, sunny bough. Now they walked, ate their scanty, repulsive meals, dressed,
                    worked, all in silence. When their eyes met both glanced guiltily away, each
                    fearing the other would discover the thought she was revolving&mdash;the
                    thought of the streets. They slept badly&mdash;Etta sometimes, Susan every
                    night. For a long time after she came to the tenements she had not slept well,
                    despite her youth and the dull toil that wore her out each day. But after many
                    months she had grown somewhat used to the noisiness&mdash;to fretting
                    babies, to wailing children, the mixed ale parties, the quarrelings of the ill
                    and the drunk, the incessant restlessness wherever people are huddled so close
                    together that repose is impossible. And she had gradually acquired the habit of
                    sleeping well&mdash;that is, well for the tenement region where no one ever
                    gets the rest without which health is impossible. Now sleeplessness came
                    again&mdash;hours on hours of listening to the hateful and maddening
                    discords of densely crowded humanity, hours on hours of
                    thinking&mdash;thinking&mdash;in the hopeless circles like those of a
                    caged animal, treading with soft swift step round and round, nose to the iron
                    wall, eyes gleaming with despairing pain. One Saturday evening after a supper of
                    scorched cornmeal which had been none too fresh when they got it at the
                    swindling grocer's on the street floor, 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0410" n="387"/>
                    Etta put on the tattered, patched old
                    skirt at which she had been toiling. "I can't make it fit to wear," said she.
                    "It's too far gone; I think"&mdash;her eyelids fluttered&mdash;"I'll go
                    see some of the girls." </p>
                <p>Susan, who was darning&mdash;seated on the one chair&mdash;yes, it had
                    once been a chair&mdash;did not look up or speak. Etta put on her
                    hat&mdash;slowly. Then, with a stealthy glance at Susan, she moved slidingly
                    toward the door. As she reached it Susan's hands dropped to her lap; so tense
                    were Etta's nerves that the gesture made her startle. "Etta!" said Susan in an
                    appealing voice. </p>
                <p>Etta's hand dropped from the knob. "Well&mdash;what is it, Lorna?" she asked
                    in a low, nervous tone. </p>
                <p>"Look at me, dear." </p>
                <p>Etta tried to obey, could not. </p>
                <p>"Don't do it&mdash;yet," said Susan. "Wait&mdash;a few more days." </p>
                <p>"Wait for what?" </p>
                <p>"I don't know. But&mdash;wait." </p>
                <p>"You get four, I get only three&mdash;and there's no chance of a raise. I
                    work slower instead of faster. I'm going to be discharged soon. I'm in rags
                    underneath. . . . I've got to go before I get sick&mdash;and won't have
                    anything to&mdash;to sell." </p>
                <p>Susan did not reply. She stared at the remains of a cheap stocking in her lap.
                    Yes, there was no doubt about it, Etta's health was going. Etta was strong, but
                    she had no such store of strength to draw upon as had accumulated for Susan
                    during the seventeen years of simple, regular life in healthful surroundings. A
                    little while and Etta would be ill&mdash;would,
                    perhaps&mdash;probably&mdash;almost certainly&mdash;die&mdash; </p>
                <p>Dan Cassatt came in at the other door, sat on the 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0411" n="388"/>
                    edge of his bed and changed his
                    trousers for what he was pleased to imagine a less disreputable pair. Midway the
                    boy stopped and eyed Susan's bare leg and foot, a grin of pleasure and amusement
                    on his precociously and viciously mature face. </p>
                <p>"My, but you keep clean," he cried. "And you've got a mighty pretty foot.
                    Minnie's is ugly as hell." </p>
                <p>Minnie was the "fancy lady" on the floor below&mdash;"my skirt," he called
                    her. Susan evidently did not hear his compliment. Dan completed his "sporting
                    toilet" with a sleeking down of his long greasy hair, took himself away to his
                    girl. Susan was watching a bug crawl down the wall toward their bed with its
                    stained and malodorous covers of rag. Etta was still standing by the door
                    motionless. She sighed, once more put her hand on the knob. </p>
                <p>Susan's voice came again. "You've never been out, have you?" "No," replied Etta. </p>
                <p>Susan began to put on her stocking. "I'll go," said she. "I'll
                    go&mdash;instead." </p>
                <p>"No!" cried Etta, sobbing. "It don't matter about me. I'm bound to be sucked
                    under. You've got a chance to pull through." </p>
                <p>"Not a ghost of a chance," answered Susan. "I'll go. You've never been." </p>
                <p>"I know, but&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"You've never been," continued Susan, fastening her shoe with its ragged string.
                    "You've never been. Well&mdash;I have." </p>
                <p>"You!" exclaimed Etta, horrified though unbelieving. "Oh, no, you haven't." </p>
                <p>"Yes," said Susan. "And worse." </p>
                <p>"And worse?" repeated Etta. "Is that what the look 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0412" n="389"/>
                    I sometimes see in your
                    eyes&mdash;when you don't know anyone's seeing&mdash;is that what it
                    means?" </p>
                <p>"I suppose so. I'll go. You stay here." </p>
                <p>"And you&mdash;out there!" </p>
                <p>"It doesn't mean much to me." </p>
                <p>Etta looked at her with eyes as devoted as a dog's. "Then we'll go together," she
                    said. </p>
                <p>Susan, pinning on her weather-stained hat, reflected. "Very well," she said
                    finally. "There's nothing lower than this." </p>
                <p>They said no more; they went out into the clear, cold winter night, out under the
                    brilliant stars. Several handsome theater buses were passing on their way from
                    the fashionable suburb to the theater. Etta looked at them, at the splendid
                    horses, at the men in top hats and fur coats&mdash;clean looking, fine
                    looking, amiable looking men&mdash;at the beautiful fur wraps of the
                    delicate women&mdash;what complexions!&mdash;what lovely
                    hair!&mdash;what jewels! Etta, her heart bursting, her throat choking,
                    glanced at Susan to see whether she too was observing. But Susan's eyes were on
                    the tenement they had just left. </p>
                <p>"What are you looking at&mdash;so queer?" asked Etta. </p>
                <p>"I was thinking that we'll not come back here." </p>
                <p>Etta started. "Not come back _home!_" </p>
                <p>Susan gave a strange short laugh. "Home!. . . No, we'll not come back home.
                    There's no use doing things halfway. We've made the plunge. We'll
                    go&mdash;the limit." </p>
                <p>Etta shivered. She admired the courage, but it terrified her. "There's
                    something&mdash;something&mdash;awful about you, Lorna," she said.
                    "You've changed till you're like a different person from what you were when 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0413" n="390"/>
                    you
                    came to the restaurant. Sometimes&mdash;that look in your
                    eyes&mdash;well, it takes my breath away." </p>
                <p>"It takes _my_ breath away, too. Come on." </p>
                <p>At the foot of the hill they took the shortest route for Vine Street, the highway
                    of the city's night life. </p>
                <p>Though they were so young and walked briskly, their impoverished blood was not
                    vigorous enough to produce a reaction against the sharp wind of the zero night
                    which nosed through their few thin garments and bit into their bodies as if they
                    were naked. They came to a vast department store. Each of its great
                    show-windows, flooded with light, was a fascinating display of clothing for
                    women upon wax models&mdash;costly jackets and cloaks of wonderful furs,
                    white, brown, gray, rich and glossy black; underclothes fine and soft, with
                    ribbons and flounces and laces; silk stockings and graceful shoes and slippers;
                    dresses for street, for ball, for afternoon, dresses with form, with lines,
                    dresses elegantly plain, dresses richly embroidered. Despite the cold the two
                    girls lingered, going from window to window, their freezing faces pinched and
                    purple, their eyes gazing hungrily. </p>
                <p>"Now that we've tried 'em all on," said Susan with a short and bitter laugh,
                    "let's dress in our dirty rags again and go." </p>
                <p>"Oh, I couldn't imagine myself in any of those things&mdash;could you?" cried
                    Etta. </p>
                <p>"Yes," answered Susan. "And better." </p>
                <p>"You were brought up to have those things, I know." </p>
                <p>Susan shook her head. "But I'm going to have them." </p>
                <p>"When?" said Etta, scenting romance. "Soon?" </p>
                <p>"As soon as I learn," was Susan's absent, unsatisfactory reply. </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0414" n="391"/>
                <p>Etta had gone back to her own misery and the contrasts to it. "I get mad through
                    and through," she cried, "when I think how all those things go to some
                    women&mdash;women that never did work and never could. And they get them
                    because they happen to belong to rich fathers and husbands or whoever protects
                    them. It isn't fair! It makes me crazy!" </p>
                <p>Susan gave a disdainful shrug. "What's the use of that kind of talk!" said she.
                    "No use at all. The thing is, _we_ haven't got what we want, and we've got to
                    _get_ it&mdash;and so we've got to _learn_ how." </p>
                <p>"I can't think of anything but the cold," said Etta. "My God, how cold I am!
                    There isn't anything I wouldn't do to get warm. There isn't anything anybody
                    wouldn't do to get warm, if they were as cold as this. It's all very well for
                    warm people to talk&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Oh, I'm sick of all the lying and faking, anyhow. Do you believe in hell,
                    Lorna?" </p>
                <p>"Not in a hot one," said Susan. </p>
                <p>Soon they struck into Vine Street, bright as day almost, and lined with beer
                    halls, concert gardens, restaurants. Through the glass fronts crowds of men and
                    women were visible&mdash;contented faces, well-fed bodies, food on the
                    tables or inviting-looking drink. Along the sidewalk poured an eager throng, all
                    the conspicuous faces in it notable for the expectancy of pleasure in the eyes. </p>
                <p>"Isn't this different!" exclaimed Etta. "My God, how cold I am&mdash;and how
                    warm everybody else is but us!" </p>
                <p>The sights, the sounds of laughter, of gay music, acted upon her like an
                    intoxicant. She tossed her head in a reckless gesture. "I don't care what
                    becomes of 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0415" n="392"/>
                    me," said she. "I'm ready for anything except dirt and starvation." </p>
                <p>Nevertheless, they hurried down Vine Street, avoiding the glances of the men and
                    behaving as if they were two working girls in a rush to get home. As they
                    walked, Susan, to delude herself into believing that she was not hesitating,
                    with fainting courage talked incessantly to Etta&mdash;told her the things
                    Mabel Connemora had explained to her&mdash;about how a woman could, and
                    must, take care of her health, if she were not to be swept under like the great
                    mass of the ignorant, careless women of the pariah class. Susan was astonished
                    that she remembered all the actress had told her&mdash;remembered it easily,
                    as if she had often thought of it, had used the knowledge habitually. </p>
                <p>They arrived at Fountain Square, tired from the long walk. They were both
                    relieved and depressed that nothing had happened. "We might go round the
                    fountain and then back," suggested Susan. </p>
                <p>They made the tour less rapidly but still keeping their heads and their glances
                    timidly down. They were numb with the cold now. To the sharp agony had succeeded
                    an ache like the steady grinding pain of rheumatism. Etta broke the silence
                    with, "Maybe we ought to go into a house." </p>
                <p>"A house! Oh&mdash;you mean a&mdash;a sporting house." At that time
                    professional prostitution had not become widespread among the working class;
                    stationary or falling wages, advancing cost of food and developing demand for
                    comfort and luxury had as yet only begun to produce their inevitable results.
                    Thus, prostitution as an industry was in the main segregated in certain streets
                    and certain houses and the prostitutes were a distinct class. </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0416" n="393"/>
                <p>"You haven't been?" inquired Etta. </p>
                <p>"No," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"Dan Cassatt and Kate told me about those places," Etta went on. "Kate says
                    they're fine and the girls make fifty and sometimes a hundred dollars a week,
                    and have everything&mdash;servants to wait on them, good food, bathrooms,
                    lovely clothes, and can drive out. But I&mdash;I think I'd stay in the
                    house." </p>
                <p>"I want to be my own boss," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"There's another side than what Kate says," continued Etta as consecutively as
                    her chattering teeth would permit. "She heard from a madam that wants her to
                    come. But Dan heard from Minnie&mdash;she used to be in one&mdash;and
                    she says the girls are slaves, that they're treated like dogs and have to take
                    anything. She says it's something dreadful the way men act&mdash;even the
                    gentlemen. She says the madam fixes things so that every girl always owes her
                    money and don't own a stitch to her back, and so couldn't leave if she wanted
                    to." </p>
                <p>"That sounds more like the truth," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"But we may _have_ to go," pleaded Etta. "It's awful cold&mdash;and if we
                    went, at least we'd have a warm place. If we wanted to leave, why, we couldn't
                    be any worse off for clothes than we are." </p>
                <p>Susan had no answer for this argument. They went several squares up Vine Street
                    in silence. Then Etta burst out again: </p>
                <p>"I'm frozen through and through, Lorna, and I'm dead tired&mdash;and hungry.
                    The wind's cutting the flesh off my bones. What in the hell does it matter what
                    becomes of us? Let's get warm, for God's sake. Let's go to a house. They're in
                    Longworth Street&mdash;the best ones." </p>
               
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0417" n="394"/>
                <p>And she came to a halt, forcing Susan to halt also. It happened to be the corner
                    of Eighth Street. Susan saw the iron fence, the leafless trees of Garfield
                    Place. "Let's go down this way," said she. "I had luck here once." </p>
                <p>"Luck!" said Etta, her curiosity triumphant over all. </p>
                <p>Susan's answer was a strange laugh. Ahead of them, a woman warmly and showily
                    dressed was sauntering along. "That's one of them," said Etta. "Let's see how
                    _she_ does it. We've got to learn quick. I can't stand this cold much longer." </p>
                <p>The two girls, their rags fluttering about their miserable bodies, kept a few
                    feet behind the woman, watched her with hollow eyes of envy and fear. Tears of
                    anguish from the cold were streaming down their cheeks. Soon a man
                    alone&mdash;a youngish man with a lurching step&mdash;came along. They
                    heard the woman say, "Hello, dear. Don't be in a hurry." </p>
                <p>He tried to lurch past her, but she seized him by the lapel of his overcoat.
                    "Lemme go," said he. "You're old enough to be a grandmother, you old hag." </p>
                <p>Susan and Etta halted and, watching so interestedly that they forgot themselves,
                    heard her laugh at his insult, heard her say wheedlingly, "Come along, dearie,
                    I'll treat you right. You're the kind of a lively, joky fellow I like." </p>
                <p>"Go to hell, gran'ma," said the man, roughly shaking her off and lurching on
                    toward the two girls. He stopped before them, eyed them by the light of the big
                    electric lamp, grinned good-naturedly. "What've we got here?" said he. "This
                    looks better." </p>
                <p>The woman rushed toward the girls, pouring out a stream of vileness. "You git out
                    of here!" she shrilled. 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0418" n="395"/>
                    "You chippies git off my beat. I'll have you
                    pinched&mdash;I will!" </p>
                <p>"Shut up!" cried the drunken man, lifting his fist. "I'll have _you_ pinched. Let
                    these ladies alone, they're friends of mine. Do you want me to call the cop?" </p>
                <p>The woman glanced toward the corner where a policeman was standing, twirling his
                    club. She turned away, cursing horribly. The man laughed. "Dirty old
                    hag&mdash;isn't she?" said he. "Don't look so scared, birdies." He caught
                    them each by an arm, stared woozily at Etta. "You're a good little looker, you
                    are. Come along with me. There's three in it." </p>
                <p>"I&mdash;I can't leave my lady friend," Etta succeeded in chattering. "Please
                    really I can't." </p>
                <p>"Your lady friend?" He turned his drunken head in Susan's direction, squinted at
                    her. He was rather good-looking. "Oh&mdash;she means _you_. Fact is, I'm so
                    soused I thought I was seein' double. Why, _you're_ a peach. I'll take you." And
                    he released his hold on Etta to seize her. "Come right along, my lovey-dovey
                    dear." </p>
                <p>Susan drew away; she was looking at him with terror and repulsion. The icy blast
                    swept down the street, sawed into her flesh savagely. </p>
                <p>"I'll give _you_ five," said the drunken man. "Come along." He grabbed her arm,
                    waved his other hand at Etta. "So long, blondie. 'Nother time. Good luck." </p>
                <p>Susan heard Etta's gasp of horror. She wrenched herself free again. "I guess I'd
                    better go with him," said she to Etta. </p>
                <p>Etta began to sob. "Oh, Lorna!" she moaned. "It's awful." </p>
                <p>"You go into the restaurant on the corner and get 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0419" n="396"/>
                    something to eat, and wait for
                    me. We can afford to spend the money. And you'll be warm there." </p>
                <p>"Here! Here!" cried the tipsy man. "What're you two whispering about? Come along,
                    skinny. No offense. I like 'em slim." And he made coarse and pointed remarks
                    about the sluggishness of fat women, laughing loudly at his own wit. </p>
                <p>The two girls did not hear. The wind straight from the Arctic was plying its
                    hideous lash upon their defenseless bodies. </p>
                <p>"Come on, lovey!" cried the man. "Let's go in out of the cold." </p>
                <p>"Oh, Lorna! You can't go with a drunken man! I'll&mdash;I'll take him. I can
                    stand it better'n you. You can go when there's a gentleman " </p>
                <p>"You don't know," said Susan. "Didn't I tell you I'd been through the worst?" </p>
                <p>"Are you coming?" broke in the man, shaking his head to scatter the clouds over
                    his sight. </p>
                <p>The cold was lashing Susan's body; and she was seeing the tenement she had
                    left&mdash;the vermin crawling, the filth everywhere, the meal bugs in the
                    rotting corn meal&mdash;and Jeb Ferguson. "Wait in the restaurant," said she
                    to Etta. "Didn't I tell you I'm a nobody. This is what's expected of me." The
                    wind clawed and tore at her quivering flesh. "It's cold, Etta. Go get warm.
                    Good-by." </p>
                <p>She yielded to the tipsy man's tugging at her arm. Etta stood as if paralyzed,
                    watching the two move slowly westward. But cold soon triumphed over horror. She
                    retraced her steps toward Vine Street. At the corner stood an elderly man with
                    an iron-gray beard. She merely glanced at him in passing, and so was startled
                    when he said in a low voice: </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0420" n="397"/>
                <p>"Go back the way you came. I'll join you." She glanced at him again, saw a gleam
                    in his eyes that assured her she had not imagined the request. Trembling and all
                    at once hot, she kept on across the street. But instead of going into the
                    restaurant she walked past it and east through dark Eighth Street. A few yards,
                    and she heard a quiet step behind her. A few yards more, and the lights of Vine
                    Street threw a man's shadow upon the sidewalk beside her. From sheer fright she
                    halted. The man faced her&mdash;a man old enough to be her father, a most
                    respectable, clean looking man with a certain churchly though hardly clerical
                    air about him. "Good evening, miss," said he. </p>
                <p>"Good evening," she faltered. </p>
                <p>"I'm a stranger&mdash;in town to buy goods and have a little fun," stammered
                    he with a grotesque attempt to be easy and familiar. "I thought maybe you could
                    help me." </p>
                <p>A little fun! Etta's lips opened, but no words came. The cold was digging its
                    needle-knives into flesh, into bone, into nerve. Through the man's thick beard
                    and mustache came the gleam of large teeth, the twisting of thick raw lips. A
                    little fun! </p>
                <p>"Would it," continued the man, nervously, "would it be very dear?" </p>
                <p>"I&mdash;I don't know," faltered Etta. </p>
                <p>"I could afford&mdash;say&mdash;" he looked at her
                    dress&mdash;"say&mdash;two dollars." </p>
                <p>"I&mdash;I" And again Etta could get no further. </p>
                <p>"The room'd be a dollar," pleaded the man. "That'd make it three." </p>
                <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;can't," burst out Etta, hysterical. "Oh, please let me
                    alone. I&mdash;I'm a good girl, but I do need 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0421" n="398"/>
                    money. But I&mdash;I
                    can't. Oh, for God's sake&mdash;I'm so cold&mdash;so cold!" </p>
                <p>The man was much embarrassed. "Oh, I'm sorry," he said feelingly. "That's
                    right&mdash;keep your virtue. Go home to your parents." He was at ease now;
                    his voice was greasy and his words sleek with the unction of an elder. "I
                    thought you were a soiled dove. I'm glad you spoke out&mdash;glad for my
                    sake as well as your own. I've got a daughter about your age. Go home, my dear,
                    and stay a good girl. I know it's hard sometimes; but never give up your
                    purity&mdash;never!" And he lifted his square-topped hard hat and turned
                    away. </p>
                <p>Suddenly Etta felt again the fury of the winter night and icy wind. As that wind
                    flapped her thin skirt and tortured her flesh, she cried,
                    "Wait&mdash;please. I was just&mdash;just fooling." </p>
                <p>The man had halted, but he was looking at her uncertainly. Etta put her hand on
                    his arm and smiled pertly up at him&mdash;smiled as she had seen other
                    street girls smile in the days when she despised them. "I'll go&mdash;if
                    you'll give me three." </p>
                <p>"I&mdash;I don't think I care to go now. You sort of put me out of the
                    humor." </p>
                <p>"Well&mdash;two, then." She gave a reckless laugh. "God, how cold it is!
                    Anybody'd go to hell to get warm a night like this." </p>
                <p>"You are a very pretty girl," said the man. He was warmly dressed; his was not
                    the thin blood of poverty. He could not have appreciated what she was feeling.
                    "You're sure you want to go? You're sure it's your&mdash;your business?" </p>
                <p>"Yes. I'm strange in this part of town. Do you know a place?" </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0422" n="399"/>
                <p>An hour later Etta went into the appointed restaurant. Her eyes searched
                    anxiously for Susan, but did not find her. She inquired at the counter. No one
                    had asked there for a young lady. This both relieved her and increased her
                    nervousness; Susan had not come and gone&mdash;but would she come? Etta was
                    so hungry that she could hold out no longer. She sat at a table near the door
                    and took up the large sheet on which was printed the bill of fare. She was
                    almost alone in the place, as it was between dinner and supper. She read the
                    bill thoroughly, then ordered black bean soup, a sirloin steak and German fried
                    potatoes. This, she had calculated, would cost altogether a dollar; undoubtedly
                    an extravagance, but everything at that restaurant seemed dear in comparison
                    with the prices to which she had been used, and she felt horribly empty. She
                    ordered the soup, to stay her while the steak was broiling. </p>
                <p>As soon as the waiter set down bread and butter she began upon it greedily. As
                    the soup came, in walked Susan&mdash;calm and self-possessed, Etta saw at
                    first glance. "I've been so frightened. You'll have a plate of soup?" asked
                    Etta, trying to look and speak in unconcerned fashion. </p>
                <p>"No, thank you," replied Susan, seating herself opposite. </p>
                <p>"There's a steak coming&mdash;a good-sized one, the waiter said it'd be." </p>
                <p>"Very well." </p>
                <p>Susan spoke indifferently. </p>
                <p>"Aren't you hungry?" </p>
                <p>"I don't know. I'll see." Susan was gazing straight ahead. Her eyes were
                    distinctly gray&mdash;gray and as hard as Susan Lenox's eyes could be. </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0423" n="400"/>
                <p>"What're you thinking about?" </p>
                <p>"I don't know," she laughed queerly. </p>
                <p>"Was&mdash;it&mdash;dreadful?" </p>
                <p>A pause, then: "Nothing is going to be dreadful to me any more. It's all in the
                    game, as Mr. Burlingham used to say." </p>
                <p>"Burlingham&mdash;who's he?" It was Etta's first faint clew toward that
                    mysterious past of Susan's into which she longed to peer. </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;a man I knew. He's dead." </p>
                <p>A long pause, Etta watching Susan's unreadable face. At last she said: </p>
                <p>"You don't seem a bit excited." </p>
                <p>Susan came back to the present. "Don't I? Your soup's getting cold." </p>
                <p>Etta ate several spoonfuls, then said with an embarrassed attempt at a laugh,
                    "I&mdash;I went, too." </p>
                <p>Susan slowly turned upon Etta her gaze&mdash;the gaze of eyes softening,
                    becoming violet. Etta's eyes dropped and the color flooded into her fair skin.
                    "He was an old man&mdash;forty or maybe fifty," she explained nervously. "He
                    gave me two dollars. I nearly didn't get him. I lost my nerve and told him I was
                    good and was only starting because I needed money." </p>
                <p>"Never whine," said Susan. "It's no use. Take what comes, and wait for a winning
                    hand." </p>
                <p>Etta looked at her in a puzzled way. "How queer you talk! Not a bit like
                    yourself. You sound so much older. . . . And your eyes&mdash;they don't look
                    natural at all." </p>
                <p>Indeed they looked supernatural. The last trace of gray was gone. They were of
                    the purest, deepest violet, luminous, mysterious, with that awe-inspiring
                    expression of utter aloneness. But as Etta spoke the expression changed. 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0424" n="401"/>
                    The
                    gray came back and with it a glance of irony. Said she: </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;nonsense! I'm all right." </p>
                <p>"I didn't mind nearly as much as I thought I would. Yes, I'll get used to it." </p>
                <p>"You mustn't," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"But I've got to." </p>
                <p>"We've got to do it, but we haven't got to get used to it," replied Susan. </p>
                <p>Etta was still puzzling at this when the dinner now came&mdash;a fine, thick
                    broiled steak, the best steak Susan had ever seen, and the best food Etta had
                    ever seen. </p>
                <p>They had happened upon one of those famous Cincinnati chop houses where in plain
                    surroundings the highest quality of plain food is served. "You _are_ hungry,
                    aren't you, Lorna?" said Etta. </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;I'm hungry," declared Susan. "Cut it&mdash;quick." </p>
                <p>"Draught beer or bottled?" asked the waiter. </p>
                <p>"Bring us draught beer," said Etta. "I haven't tasted beer since our restaurant
                    burned." </p>
                <p>"I never tasted it," said Susan. "But I'll try it tonight." </p>
                <p>Etta cut two thick slices from the steak, put them on Susan's plate with some of
                    the beautifully browned fried potatoes. "Gracious, they have good things to eat
                    here!" she exclaimed. Then she cut two thick slices for herself, and filled her
                    mouth. Her eyes glistened, the color came into her pale cheeks. "Isn't it
                    _grand_!" she cried, when there was room for words to pass out. </p>
                <p>"Grand," agreed Susan, a marvelous change of expression in her face also. </p>
                <p>The beer came. Etta drank a quarter of the tall glass at once. Susan tasted,
                    rather liked the fresh 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0425" n="402"/>
                    bitter-sweet odor and flavor. "Is it&mdash;very
                    intoxicating?" she inquired. </p>
                <p>"If you drink enough," said Etta. "But not one glass." </p>
                <p>Susan took quite a drink. "I feel a lot less tired already," declared she. </p>
                <p>"Me too," said Etta. "My, what a meal! I never had anything like this in my life.
                    When I think what we've been through! Lorna, will it _last_?" </p>
                <p>"We mustn't think about that," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"Tell me what happened to you." </p>
                <p>"Nothing. He gave me the money, that was all." </p>
                <p>"Then we've got seven dollars&mdash;seven dollars and twenty cents, with what
                    we brought away from home with us." </p>
                <p>"Seven dollars&mdash;and twenty cents," repeated Susan thoughtfully. Then a
                    queer smile played around the corners of her mouth. "Seven
                    dollars&mdash;that's a week's wages for both of us at Matson's." </p>
                <p>"But I'd go back to honest work tomorrow&mdash;if I could find a good job,"
                    Etta said eagerly&mdash;too eagerly. "Wouldn't you, Lorna?" </p>
                <p>"I don't know," replied Susan. She had the inability to make pretenses, either to
                    others or to herself, which characterizes stupid people and also the large,
                    simple natures. </p>
                <p>"Oh, you can't mean that!" protested Etta. Instead of replying Susan began to
                    talk of what to do next. "We must find a place to sleep, and we must buy a few
                    things to make a better appearance." </p>
                <p>"I don't dare spend anything yet," said Etta. "I've got only my two dollars. Not
                    that when this meal's paid for." </p>
               
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0426" n="403"/>
                
                <p>"We're going to share even," said Susan. "As long as either has anything, it
                    belongs to both." </p>
                <p>The tears welled from Etta's eyes. "You are too good, Lorna! You mustn't be. It
                    isn't the way to get on. Anyhow, I can't accept anything from you. You wouldn't
                    take anything from me." </p>
                <p>"We've got to help each other up," insisted Susan. "We share even&mdash;and
                    let's not talk any more about it. Now, what shall we get? How much ought we to
                    lay out?" </p>
                <p>The waiter here interrupted. "Beg pardon, young ladies," said he. "Over yonder,
                    at the table four down, there's a couple of gents that'd like to join you. I
                    seen one of 'em flash quite a roll, and they acts too like easy spenders." </p>
                <p>As Susan was facing that way, she examined them. They were young men, rather
                    blond, with smooth faces, good-natured eyes and mouths; they were well
                    dressed&mdash;one, the handsomer, notably so. Susan merely glanced; both men
                    at once smiled at her with an unimpertinent audacity that probably came out of
                    the champagne bottle in a silver bucket of ice on their table. </p>
                <p>"Shall I tell 'em to come over?" said the waiter. </p>
                <p>"Yes," replied Susan. </p>
                <p>She was calm, but Etta twitched with nervousness, saying, "I wish I'd had your
                    experience. I wish we didn't look so dreadful&mdash;me especially. __I__'m
                    not pretty enough to stand out against these awful clothes." </p>
                <p>The two men were pushing eagerly toward them, the taller and less handsome
                    slightly in advance. He said, his eyes upon Susan, "We were lonesome, and you
                    looked a little that way too. We're much obliged." He glanced at the waiter.
                    "Another bottle of the same." </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0427" n="404"/>
                <p>"I don't want anything to drink," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"Nor I," chimed in Etta. "No, thank you." </p>
                <p>The young man waved the waiter away with, "Get it for my friend and me, then." He
                    smiled agreeably at Susan. "You won't mind my friend and me drinking?" </p>
                <p>"Oh, no. " </p>
                <p>"And maybe you'll change your mind," said the shorter man to Etta. "You see, if
                    we all drink, we'll get acquainted faster. Don't you like champagne?" </p>
                <p>"I never tasted it," Etta confessed. </p>
                <p>"Neither did I," admitted Susan. </p>
                <p>"You're sure to like it," said the taller man to Susan&mdash;his friend
                    presently addressed him as John. "Noththing{sic} equal to it for making friends.
                    I like it for itself, and I like it for the friends it has made me." </p>
                <p>Champagne was not one of the commonplaces of that modest chop house. So the
                    waiter opened the bottle with much ceremony. Susan and Etta startled when the
                    cork popped ceilingward in the way that in such places is still regarded as
                    fashionable. They watched with interested eyes the pouring of the beautiful pale
                    amber liquid, were fascinated when they saw how the bubbles surged upward
                    incessantly, imprisoned joys thronging to escape. And after the first glass, the
                    four began to have the kindliest feelings for each other. Sorrow and shame,
                    poverty and foreboding, took wings unto themselves and flew away. The girls felt
                    deliciously warm and contented, and thought the young men charming&mdash;a
                    splendid change from the coarse, badly dressed youths of the tenement, with
                    their ignorant speech and rough, misshapen hands. They were ashamed of their own
                    hands, were painfully self-conscious whenever lifting the glass to the lips
                    brought 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0428" n="405"/>
                    them into view. Etta's hands in fact were not so badly spoiled as might
                    have been expected, considering her long years of rough work; the nails were in
                    fairly good condition and the skin was rougher to the touch than to the sight.
                    Susan's hands had not really been spoiled as yet. She had been proud of them and
                    had taken care of them; still, they were not the hands of a lady, but of a
                    working girl. The young men had gentlemen's hands&mdash;strong, evidently
                    exercised only at sports, not at degrading and deforming toil. </p>
                <p>The shorter and handsomer youth, who answered to the name of Fatty, for obvious
                    but not too obvious reasons, addressed himself to Etta. John&mdash;who, it
                    came out, was a Chicagoan, visiting Fatty&mdash;fell to Susan. The champagne
                    made him voluble; he was soon telling all about himself&mdash;a senior at
                    Ann Arbor, as was Fatty also; he intended to be a lawyer; he was fond of a good,
                    time was fond of the girls&mdash;liked girls who were gay rather than
                    respectable ones&mdash;"because with the prim girls you have to quit just as
                    the fun ought really to begin." </p>
                <p>After two glasses Susan, warned by a slight dizziness, stopped drinking; Etta
                    followed her example. But the boys kept on, ordered a second bottle. "This is
                    the fourth we've had tonight," said Fatty proudly when it came. </p>
                <p>"Don't it make you dizzy?" asked Etta. </p>
                <p>"Not a bit," Fatty assured her. But she noticed that his tongue now swung
                    trippingly loose. </p>
                <p>"You haven't been at&mdash;at this&mdash;long, have you?" inquired John
                    of Susan. </p>
                <p>"Not long," replied she. </p>
                <p>Etta, somewhat giddied, overheard and put in, "We began tonight. We got tired of
                    starving and freezing." </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0429" n="406"/>
                <p>John looked deepest sympathy into Susan's calm violet-gray eyes. "I don't blame
                    you," said he. "A woman does have a&mdash;a hades of a time!" </p>
                <p>"We were going out to buy some clothes when you came," proceeded Etta. "We're in
                    an awful state." </p>
                <p>"I wondered how two girls with faces like yours," said John, "came to be dressed
                    so&mdash;so differently. That was what first attracted us." Then, as Etta
                    and Fatty were absorbed in each other, he went on to Susan: "And your
                    eyes&mdash;I mustn't forget them. You certainly have got a beautiful face.
                    And your mouth&mdash;so sweet and sad&mdash;but, what a lovely, _lovely_
                    smile!" </p>
                <p>At this Susan smiled still more broadly with pleasure. "I'm glad you're pleased,"
                    said she. </p>
                <p>"Why, if you were dressed up&mdash; </p>
                <p>"You're not a working girl by birth, are you?" </p>
                <p>"I wish I had been," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"Oh, I think a girl's got as good a right as a man to have a good time," lied
                    John. </p>
                <p>"Don't say things you don't believe," said Susan. "It isn't necessary." </p>
                <p>"I can hand that back to you. You weren't frank, yourself, when you said you
                    wished you'd been born in the class of your friend&mdash;and of my friend
                    Fatty, too." </p>
                <p>Susan's laugh was confession. The champagne was dancing in her blood. She said
                    with a reckless toss of the head: </p>
                <p>"I was born nothing. So I'm free to become anything I please anything except
                    respectable." </p>
                <p>Here Fatty broke in. "I'll tell you what let's do. Let's all go shopping. We can
                    help you girls select your things." </p>
                <p>Susan laughed. "We're going to buy about three 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0430" n="407"/>
                    dollars' worth. There won't be any
                    selecting. We'll simply take the cheapest." </p>
                <p>"Then&mdash;let's go shopping," said John, "and you two girls can help Fatty
                    and me select clothes for you." </p>
                <p>"That's the talk!" cried Fatty. And he summoned the waiter. "The bill," said he
                    in the manner of a man who likes to enjoy the servility of servants. </p>
                <p>"We hadn't paid for our supper," said Susan. "How much was it, Etta?" </p>
                <p>"A dollar twenty-five." </p>
                <p>"We're going to pay for that," said Fatty. "What d'ye take us for?" </p>
                <p>"Oh, no. We must pay it," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"Don't be foolish. Of course I'll pay." </p>
                <p>"No," said Susan quietly, ignoring Etta's wink. And from her bosom she took a
                    crumpled five-dollar bill. </p>
                <p>"I should say you _were_ new," laughed John. "You don't even know where to carry
                    your money yet." And they all laughed, Susan and Etta because they felt gay and
                    assumed the joke whatever it was must be a good one. Then John laid his hand
                    over hers and said, "Put your money away." </p>
                <p>Susan looked straight at him. "I can't allow it," she said. "I'm not that
                    poor&mdash;yet." </p>
                <p>John colored. "I beg your pardon," he said. And when the bill came he compelled
                    Fatty to let her pay a dollar and a quarter of it out of her crumpled five. The
                    two girls were fascinated by the large roll of bills&mdash;fives, tens,
                    twenties&mdash;which Fatty took from his trousers pocket. They stared
                    open-eyed when he laid a twenty on the waiter's plate along with Susan's five.
                    And it frightened them when he, after handing Susan her change, had left only a
                    two-dollar bill, four silver 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0431" n="408"/>
                    quarters and a dime. He gave the silver to the
                    waiter. </p>
                <p>"Was that for a tip?" asked Susan. </p>
                <p>"Yes," said Fatty. "I always give about ten per cent of the bill unless it runs
                    over ten dollars. In that case&mdash;a quarter a person as a rule. Of
                    course, if the bill was very large, I'd give more." He was showing his amusement
                    at her inquisitiveness. </p>
                <p>"I wanted to know," explained she. "I'm very ignorant, and I've got to learn." </p>
                <p>"That's right," said John, admiringly&mdash;with a touch of condescension.
                    "Don't be afraid to confess ignorance." </p>
                <p>"I'm not," replied Susan. "I used to be afraid of not being respectable and that
                    was all. Now, I haven't any fear at all." </p>
                <p>"You are a queer one!" exclaimed John. "You oughtn't to be in this life." </p>
                <p>"Where then?" asked she. </p>
                <p>"I don't know," he confessed. </p>
                <p>"Neither do I." Her expression suddenly was absent, with a quaint, slight smile
                    hovering about her lips. She looked at him merrily. "You see, it's got to be
                    something that isn't respectable." </p>
                <p>"What _do_ you mean?" demanded he. </p>
                <p>Her answer was a laugh. </p>
                <p>Fatty declared it too cold to chase about afoot&mdash;"Anyhow, it's
                    late&mdash;nearly eleven, and unless we're quick all the stores'll be
                    closed." The waiter called them a carriage; its driver promised to take them to
                    a shop that didn't close till midnight on Saturdays. Said Fatty, as they drove
                    away: </p>
                <p>"Well, I suppose, Etta, you'll say you've never been in a carriage before." </p>
                <p>"Oh, yes, I have," cried Etta. "Twice&mdash;at funerals." </p>
               
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0432" n="409"/>
                <p>This made everyone laugh&mdash;this and the champagne and the air which no
                    longer seemed cruel to the girls but stimulating, a grateful change from the
                    close warmth of the room. As the boys were smoking cigarettes, they had the
                    windows down. The faces of both girls were flushed and lively, and their cheeks
                    seemed already to have filled out. The four made so much noise that the crowds
                    on the sidewalk were looking at them&mdash;looking smilingly, delighted by
                    the sight of such gayety. Susan was even gayer than Etta. She sang, she took a
                    puff at John's cigarette; then laughed loudly when he seized and kissed her,
                    laughed again as she kissed him; and she and John fell into each other's arms
                    and laughed uproariously as they saw Fatty and Etta embracing. </p>
                <p>The driver kept his promise; eleven o'clock found them bursting into Sternberg's,
                    over the Rhine&mdash;a famous department store for Germans of all classes.
                    They had an hour, and they made good use of it. Etta was for yielding to Fatty's
                    generous urgings and buying right and left. But Susan would not have it. She
                    told the men what she and Etta would take&mdash;a simple complete outfit,
                    and no more. Etta wanted furs and finery. Susan kept her to plain, serviceable
                    things. Only once did she yield. When Etta and Fatty begged to be allowed a big
                    showy hat, Susan yielded&mdash;but gave John leave to buy her only the
                    simplest of simple hats. "You needn't tell _me_ any yarns about your birth and
                    breeding," said he in a low tone so that Etta should not hear. </p>
                <p>But that subject did not interest Susan. "Let's forget it," said she, almost
                    curtly. "I've cut out the past&mdash;and the future. Today's enough for me." </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0433" n="410"/>
                <p>"And for me, too," protested he. "I hope you're having as good fun as I am." </p>
                <p>"This is the first time I've really laughed in nearly a year," said she. "You
                    don't know what it means to be poor and hungry and cold&mdash;worst of all,
                    cold." </p>
                <p>"You unhappy child," said John tenderly. </p>
                <p>But Susan was laughing again, and making jokes about a wonderful German party
                    dress all covered with beads and lace and ruffles and embroidery. When they
                    reached the shoe department, Susan asked John to take Fatty away. He understood
                    that she was ashamed of their patched and holed stockings, and hastened to obey.
                    They were making these their last purchases when the big bell rang for the
                    closing. "I'm glad these poor tired shopgirls and clerks are set free," said
                    John. </p>
                <p>It was one of those well-meaning but worthless commonplaces of word-kindness that
                    get for their utterance perhaps exaggerated credit for "good heart." Susan,
                    conscience-stricken, halted. "And I never once thought of them!" she exclaimed.
                    "It just shows." </p>
                <p>"Shows what?" </p>
                <p>"Oh, nothing. Come on. I must forget that, for I can't be happy again till I do.
                    I understand now why the comfortable people can be happy. They keep from knowing
                    or they make themselves forget." </p>
                <p>"Why not?" said John. "What's the use in being miserable about things that can't
                    be helped?" </p>
                <p>"No use at all," replied the girl. She laughed. "I've forgotten." </p>
                <p>The carriage was so filled with their bundles that they had some difficulty in
                    making room for themselves&mdash;finally accomplished it by each girl
                    sitting on her young man's lap. They drove to a quietly placed, scrupulously
                    clean little hotel overlooking Lincoln 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0434" n="411"/>
                    Park. "We're going to take rooms here and
                    dress," explained Fatty. "Then we'll wander out and have some supper." </p>
                <p>By this time Susan and Etta had lost all sense of strangeness. The spirit of
                    adventure was rampant in them as in a dreaming child. And the life they had been
                    living&mdash;what they had seen and heard and grown accustomed
                    to&mdash;made it easy for them to strike out at once and briskly in the new
                    road, so different from the dreary and cruel path along which they had been
                    plodding. They stood laughing and joking in the parlor while the boys
                    registered; then the four went up to two small but comfortable and fascinatingly
                    clean rooms with a large bathroom between. "Fatty and I will go down to the bar
                    while you two dress," said John. </p>
                <p>"Not on your life!" exclaimed Fatty. "We'll have the bar brought up to us." </p>
                <p>But John, fortified by Susan's look of gratitude for his tactfulness, whispered
                    to his friend&mdash;what Susan could easily guess. And Fatty said, "Oh, I
                    never thought of it. Yes, we'll give 'em a chance. Don't be long, girls." </p>
                <p>"Thank you," said Susan to John. </p>
                <p>"That's all right. Take your time." </p>
                <p>Susan locked the hall door behind the two men. She rushed to the bathroom, turned
                    on the hot water. "Oh, Etta!" she cried, tears in her eyes, a hysterical sob in
                    her throat. "A bathtub again!" </p>
                <p>Etta too was enthusiastic; but she had not that intense hysterical joy which
                    Susan felt&mdash;a joy that can be appreciated only by a person who, clean
                    by instinct and by lifelong habit, has been shut out from thorough cleanliness
                    for long months of dirt and foul odors and 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0435" n="412"/>
                    cold. It was no easy matter to become
                    clean again after all those months. But there was plenty of soap and brushes and
                    towels, and at last the thing was accomplished. Then they tore open the bundles
                    and arrayed themselves in the fresh new underclothes, in the simple attractive
                    costumes of jacket, blouse and skirt. Susan had returned to her class, and had
                    brought Etta with her. </p>
                <p>"What shall we do with these?" asked Etta, pointing disdainfully with the toe of
                    her new boot to the scatter of the garments they had cast off. </p>
                <p>Susan looked down at it in horror. She could not believe that _she_ had been
                    wearing such stuff&mdash;that it was the clothing of all her associates of
                    the past six months&mdash;was the kind of attire in which most of her
                    fellow-beings went about the beautiful earth, She shuddered. "Isn't life
                    dreadful?" she cried. And she kicked together the tattered, patched, stained
                    trash, kicked it on to a large piece of heavy wrapping paper she had spread out
                    upon the floor. Thus, without touching her discarded self, she got it wrapped up
                    and bound with a strong string. She rang for the maid, gave her a quarter and
                    pointed to the bundle. "Please take that and throw it away," she said. </p>
                <p>When the maid was gone Etta said: "I'm mighty glad to have it out of the room." </p>
                <p>"Out of the room?" cried Susan. "Out of my heart. Out of my life." </p>
                <p>They put on their hats, admired themselves in the mirror, and
                    descended&mdash;Susan remembering halfway that they had left the lights on
                    and going back to turn them off. The door boy summoned the two young men to the
                    parlor. They entered and exclaimed in real amazement. For they were facing two
                    extremely 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0436" n="413"/>
                    pretty young women, one dark, the other fair. The two faces were
                    wreathed in pleased and grateful smiles. </p>
                <p>"Don't we look nice?" demanded Etta. </p>
                <p>"Nice!" cried Fatty. "We sure did draw a pair of first prizes&mdash;didn't
                    we, Johnny?" </p>
                <p>John did not reply. He was gazing at Susan. Etta had young beauty but it was of
                    the commonplace kind. In Susan's face and carriage there was far more than
                    beauty. "Where _did_ you come from?" said John to her in an undertone. "And
                    _where_ are you going?" </p>
                <p>"Out to supper, I hope," laughed she. </p>
                <p>"Your eyes change&mdash;don't they? I thought they were violet. Now I see
                    they're gray&mdash;gray as can be." </p>
            </div1>

                <head> XXII</head>
                <p> AT lunch, well toward the middle of the following afternoon, Fatty&mdash;his
                    proper name was August Gulick&mdash;said: "John and I don't start for Ann
                    Arbor until a week from today. That means seven clear days. A lot can be done in
                    that time, with a little intelligent hustling. What do you say, girls? Do you
                    stick to us?" </p>
                <p>"As long as you'll let us," said Etta, who was delighting Gulick with her frank
                    and wondering and grateful appreciation of his munificence. Never before had his
                    own private opinion of himself received such a flatteringly sweeping
                    indorsement&mdash;from anyone who happened to impress him as worth while. In
                    the last phrase lies the explanation of her success through a policy that is
                    always dangerous and usually a failure. </p>
                <p>So it was settled that with the quiet little hotel as headquarters the four would
                    spend a week in exploring Cincinnati as a pleasure ground. Gulick knew the town
                    thoroughly. His father was a brewer whose name was on many a huge beer wagon
                    drawn about those streets by showy Clydesdales. Also he had plenty of money;
                    and, while Redmond&mdash;for his friend was the son of Redmond, well known
                    as a lawyer-politician in Chicago&mdash;had nothing like so much as Gulick,
                    still he had enough to make a passable pretense at keeping up his end. For Etta
                    and Susan the city had meant shabby to filthy tenements, toil and weariness and
                    sorrow. There was opened to their ravished young eyes "the city"&mdash;what
                    reveals itself to the pleasure-seeker with 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0438" n="415"/>
                    pocket well filled&mdash;what we
                    usually think of when we pronounce its name, forgetting what its reality is for
                    all but a favored few of those within its borders. It was a week of music and of
                    laughter&mdash;music especially&mdash;music whenever they ate or drank,
                    music to dance by, music in the beer gardens where they spent the early
                    evenings, music at the road houses where they arrived in sleighs after the
                    dances to have supper&mdash;unless you choose to call it breakfast. You
                    would have said that Susan had slipped out of the tenement life as she had out
                    of its garments, that she had retained not a trace of it even in memory.
                    But&mdash;in those days began her habit of never passing a beggar without
                    giving something. </p>
                <p>Within three or four days this life brought a truly amazing transformation in the
                    two girls. You would not have recognized in them the pale and wan and ragged
                    outcasts of only the Saturday night before. "Aren't you happy?" said Etta to
                    Susan, in one of the few moments they were alone. "But I don't need to ask. I
                    didn't know you could be so gay." </p>
                <p>"I had forgotten how to laugh," replied Susan. </p>
                <p>"I suppose I ought to be ashamed," pursued Etta. </p>
                <p>"Why?" inquired Susan. </p>
                <p>"Oh, you know why. You know how people'd talk if they knew." </p>
                <p>"What people?" said Susan. "Anyone who's willing to give you anything?" </p>
                <p>"No," admitted Etta. "But&mdash;" There she halted. </p>
                <p>Susan went on: "I don't propose to be bothered by the other kind. They wouldn't
                    do anything for me if they could except sneer and condemn." </p>
                <p>"Still, you know it isn't right, what we're doing." </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0439" n="416"/>
                <p>"I know it isn't cold&mdash;or hunger&mdash;or rags and
                    dirt&mdash;and bugs," replied Susan. </p>
                <p>Those few words were enough to conjure even to Etta's duller fancy the whole
                    picture to its last detail of loathsome squalor. Into Etta's face came a dazed
                    expression. "Was that really _us_, Lorna?" </p>
                <p>"No," said Susan with a certain fierceness. "It was a dream. But we must take
                    care not to have that dream again." </p>
                <p>"I'd forgotten how cold I was," said Etta; "hadn't you?" </p>
                <p>"No," said Susan, "I hadn't forgotten anything." </p>
                <p>"Yes, I suppose it was all worse for you than for me. _You_ used to be a lady." </p>
                <p>"Don't talk nonsense," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"I don't regret what I'm doing," Etta now declared. "It was Gus that made me
                    think about it." She looked somewhat sheepish as she went on to explain. "I had
                    a little too much to drink last night. And when Gus and I were alone, I
                    cried&mdash;for no reason except the drink. He asked me why and I had to say
                    something, and it popped into my head to say I was ashamed of the life I was
                    leading. As things turned out, I'm glad I said it. He was awfully impressed." </p>
                <p>"Of course," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"You never saw anything like it," continued Etta with an expression suggesting a
                    feeling that she ought to be ashamed but could not help being amused. "He acted
                    differently right away. Why don't you try it on John?" </p>
                <p>"What for?" </p>
                <p>"Oh, it'll make him&mdash;make him have more&mdash;more respect for you."
                    "Perhaps," said Susan indifferently. </p>
               
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0440" n="417"/>
                <p>"Don't you want John to&mdash;to respect you?" </p>
                <p>"I've been too busy having a good time to think much about him&mdash;or about
                    anything. I'm tired of thinking. I want to rest. Last night was the first time
                    in my life I danced as much as I wanted to." </p>
                <p>"Don't you like John?" </p>
                <p>"Certainly." </p>
                <p>"He does know a lot, doesn't he? He's like you. He reads and and
                    thinks&mdash;and&mdash; He's away ahead of Fatty except&mdash; You
                    don't mind my having the man with the most money?" </p>
                <p>"Not in the least," laughed Susan. "Money's another thing I'm glad to rest from
                    thinking about." </p>
                <p>"But this'll last only a few days longer. And&mdash;If you managed John
                    Redmond right, Lorna&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Now&mdash;you must not try to make me think." </p>
                <p>"Lorna&mdash;are you _really_ happy?" </p>
                <p>"Can't you see I am?" </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;when we're all together. But when&mdash;when you're alone with
                    him&mdash;" </p>
                <p>Susan's expression stopped her. It was a laughing expression; and
                    yet&mdash;Said Susan: "I am happy, dear&mdash;very happy. I eat and
                    drink and sleep&mdash;and I am, oh, so glad to be alive." </p>
                <p>"_Isn't_ it good to be alive!&mdash;if you've got plenty," exclaimed Etta. "I
                    never knew before. _This_ is the dream, Lorna&mdash;and I think I'll kill
                    myself if I have to wake." </p>
                <p> On Saturday afternoon the four were in one of the rooms discussing where the
                    farewell dinner should be held and what they would eat and drink. Etta called
                    Susan into the other room and shut the door between. </p>
                <p>"Fatty wants me to go along with him and live in 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0441" n="418"/>
                    Detroit," said she, blurting it
                    out as if confessing a crime. </p>
                <p>"Isn't that splendid!" cried Susan, kissing her. "I thought he would. He fell in
                    love with you at first sight." </p>
                <p>"That's what he says. But, Lorna&mdash;I&mdash;I don't know _what_ to
                    do!" </p>
                <p>"_Do_? Why, go. What else is there? Go, of course." </p>
                <p>"Oh, no, Lorna," protested Etta. "I couldn't leave you. I couldn't get along
                    without you." </p>
                <p>"But you must go. Don't you love him?" </p>
                <p>Etta began to weep. "That's the worst of it. I do love him so! And I think he
                    loves me&mdash;and might marry me and make me a good woman again. . . . You
                    mustn't ever tell John or anybody about that&mdash;that dreadful man I went
                    with&mdash;will you, dear?" </p>
                <p>"What do you take me for?" said Susan. </p>
                <p>"I've told Fatty I was a good girl until I met him. You haven't told John about
                    yourself?" Susan shook her head. </p>
                <p>"I suppose not. You're so secretive. You really think I ought to go?" </p>
                <p>"I know it." </p>
                <p>Etta was offended by Susan's positive, practical tone. "I don't believe you
                    care." </p>
                <p>"Yes, I care," said Susan. "But you're right to follow the man you love. Besides,
                    there's nothing so good in sight here." </p>
                <p>"What'll _you_ do? Oh, I can't go, Lorna!" </p>
                <p>"Now, Etta," said Susan calmly, "don't talk nonsense. I'll get along all right." </p>
                <p>"You come to Detroit. You could find a job there, and we could live together." </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0442" n="419"/>
                <p>"Would Fatty like that?" </p>
                <p>Etta flushed and glanced away. Young Gulick had soon decided that Susan was the
                    stronger&mdash;therefore, the less "womanly"&mdash;of the two girls, and
                    must be the evil influence over her whom he had appeared just in time to save.
                    When he said this to Etta, she protested&mdash;not very vigorously, because
                    she wished him to think her really almost innocent. She wasn't _quite_ easy in
                    her mind as to whether she had been loyal to Lorna. But, being normally human,
                    she soon _almost_ convinced herself that but for Lorna she never would have made
                    the awful venture. Anyhow, since it would help her with Gulick and wouldn't do
                    Lorna the least mite of harm, why not let him think he was right? </p>
                <p>Said Susan: "Hasn't he been talking to you about getting away from&mdash;from
                    all this?" </p>
                <p>"But I don't care," cried Etta, moved to an outburst of frankness by her sense of
                    security in Susan's loyalty and generosity. "He doesn't understand. Men are
                    fools about women. He thinks he likes in me what I haven't got at all. As a
                    matter of fact if I had been what he made me tell him I was, why we'd never have
                    met&mdash;or got acquainted in the way that makes us so fond of each other.
                    And I owe it all to you, Lorna. I don't care what he says, Lorna&mdash;or
                    does. I want you." </p>
                <p>"Can't go," said Susan, not conscious&mdash;yet not unaware,
                    either&mdash;of the curious mixture of heart and art in Etta's outburst of
                    apparent eagerness to risk everything for love of her. "Can't possibly go. I've
                    made other plans. The thing for you is to be straight&mdash;get some kind of
                    a job in Detroit&mdash;make Fatty marry you&mdash;quick!" </p>
                <p>"He would, but his father'd throw him out." </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0443" n="420"/>
                <p>"Not if you were an honest working girl." </p>
                <p>"But&mdash;" Etta was silent and reflective for a moment. "Men are so queer,"
                    she finally said. "If I'd been an honest working girl he'd never have noticed
                    me. It's because I am what I am that I've been able to get acquainted with him
                    and fascinate him. And he feels it's a sporty thing to do&mdash;to marry a
                    fast girl. If I was to settle down to work, be a regular working
                    girl&mdash;why, I'm afraid he&mdash;he'd stop loving me. Then, too, he
                    likes to believe he's rescuing me from a life of shame. I've watched him close.
                    I understand him." </p>
                <p>"No doubt," said Susan drily. </p>
                <p>"Oh, I know you think I'm deceitful. But a woman's got to be, with a man. And I
                    care a lot about him&mdash;aside from the fact that he can make me
                    comfortable and&mdash;and protect me from&mdash;from the streets. If you
                    cared for a man&mdash;No, I guess you wouldn't. You oughtn't to be
                    so&mdash;so _honest_, Lorna. It'll always do you up." </p>
                <p>Susan laughed, shrugged her shoulders. "I am what I am," said she. "I can't be
                    any different. If I tried, I'd only fail worse." </p>
                <p>"You don't love John&mdash;do you?" </p>
                <p>"I like him." </p>
                <p>"Then you wouldn't have to do _much_ pretending," urged Etta. "And what does a
                    little pretending amount to?" </p>
                <p>"That's what I say to myself," replied Susan thoughtfully. </p>
                <p>"It isn't nearly as bad as&mdash;as what we started out to do." </p>
                <p>Susan laughed at Etta's little hypocrisy for her respectability's comfort. "As
                    what we did&mdash;and are doing," corrected she. Burlingham had taught her
                    that 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0444" n="421"/>
                    it only makes things worse and more difficult to lie to oneself about them. </p>
                <p>"John's crazy about you. But he hasn't money enough to ask you to come along.
                    And&mdash;" Etta hesitated, eyed Susan doubtfully. "You're _sure_ you don't
                    love him?" </p>
                <p>"No. I couldn't love him any more than&mdash;than I could hate him." Susan's
                    strange look drifted across her features. "It's very queer, how I feel toward
                    men. But&mdash;I don't love him and I shan't pretend. I want to, but
                    somehow&mdash;I can't." </p>
                <p>Etta felt that she could give herself the pleasure of unburdening herself of a
                    secret. "Then I may as well tell you, he's engaged to a girl he thinks he ought
                    to marry." </p>
                <p>"I suspected so." </p>
                <p>"And you don't mind?" inquired Etta, unable to read Susan's queer expression. </p>
                <p>"Except for him&mdash;and her&mdash;a little," replied Susan. "I guess
                    that's why I haven't liked him better&mdash;haven't trusted him at all." </p>
                <p>"Aren't men dreadful! And he is so nice in many ways. . . . Lorna&mdash;"
                    Etta was weeping again. "I can't go&mdash;I can't. I mustn't leave you." </p>
                <p>"Don't be absurd. You've simply got to do it." </p>
                <p>"And I do love him," said Etta, calmed again by Susan's calmness. "And if he
                    married me&mdash;Oh, how grateful I'd be!" </p>
                <p>"I should say!" exclaimed Susan. She kissed Etta and petted her. "And he'll have
                    a mighty good wife." </p>
                <p>"Do you think I can marry him?" </p>
                <p>"If you love him&mdash;and don't worry about catching him." </p>
                <p>Etta shook her head in rejection of this piece of idealistic 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0445" n="422"/>
                    advice. "But a
                    girl's got to be shrewd. You ought to be more so, Lorna." </p>
                <p>"That depends on what a girl wants," said Susan, absently. "Upon what she wants,"
                    she repeated. </p>
                <p>"What do _you_ want?" inquired Etta curiously. </p>
                <p>"I don't know," Susan answered slowly. </p>
                <p>"I wish I knew what was going on in your head!" exclaimed Etta. </p>
                <p>"So do I," said Susan, smiling. </p>
                <p>"Do you really mind my going? Really&mdash;honestly?" </p>
                <p>There wasn't a flaw in Susan's look or tone. "If you tried to stay with me, I'd
                    run away from you." </p>
                <p>"And if I do get him, I can help you. Once he's mine&mdash;" Etta rounded out
                    her sentence with an expression of countenance which it was well her adoring
                    rescuer did not see. Not that it lacked womanliness; "womanly" is the word that
                    most exactly describes it&mdash;and always will exactly describe such
                    expressions&mdash;and the thoughts behind&mdash;so long as men compel
                    women to be just women, under penalty of refusing them support if they are not
                    so. </p>
                <p>Redmond came in, and Etta left him alone with Susan. "Well, has Etta told you?"
                    he asked. </p>
                <p>"Yes," replied the girl. She looked at him&mdash;simply a look, but the
                    violet-gray eyes had an unusual seeming of seeing into minds and hearts, an
                    expression that was perhaps the more disquieting because it was sympathetic
                    rather than critical. </p>
                <p>His glance shifted. He was a notably handsome young fellow&mdash;too young
                    for any display of character in his face, or for any development of it beyond
                    the amiable, free and easy lover of a jolly good time that is the type repeated
                    over and over again among the
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0446" n="423"/>
                    youth of the comfortable classes that send their
                    sons to college. </p>
                <p>"Are you going with her?" he asked. </p>
                <p>"No," said Susan. </p>
                <p>Redmond's face fell. "I hoped you liked me a little better than that," said he. </p>
                <p>"It isn't a question of you." </p>
                <p>"But it's a question of _you_ with me," he cried. "I'm in love with you, Lorna.
                    I'm&mdash;I'm tempted to say all sorts of crazy things that I think but
                    haven't the courage to act on." He kneeled down beside her, put his arms round
                    her waist. "I'm crazy about you, Lorna. </p>
                <p>. . . Tell me&mdash;Were you&mdash;Had you been&mdash;before we met?" </p>
                <p>"Yes," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"Why don't you deny it?" he exclaimed. "Why don't you fool me, as Etta fooled
                    Gus?" </p>
                <p>"Etta's story is different from mine," said Susan. "She's had no experience at
                    all, compared to me." </p>
                <p>"I don't believe it," declared he. "I know she's been stuffing Fatty, has made
                    him think that you led her away. But I can soon knock those silly ideas out of
                    his silly head&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"It's the truth," interrupted Susan, calmly. </p>
                <p>"No matter. You could be a good woman." Impulsively, "If you'll settle down and
                    be a good woman, I'll marry you." </p>
                <p>Susan smiled gently. "And ruin your prospects?" </p>
                <p>"I don't care for prospects beside you. You _are_ a good woman&mdash;inside.
                    The better I know you the less like a fast woman you are. Won't you go to work,
                    Lorna, and wait for me?" </p>
                <p>Her smile had a little mockery in it now&mdash;perhaps to hide from him how
                    deeply she was moved. "No matter 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0447" n="424"/>
                    what else I did, I'd not wait for you, Johnny.
                    You'd never come. You're not a Johnny-on-the-spot." </p>
                <p>"You think I'm weak&mdash;don't you?" he said. Then, as she did not answer,
                    "Well, I am. But I love you, all the same." </p>
                <p>For the first time he felt that he had touched her heart. The tears sprang to her
                    eyes, which were not at all gray now but all violet, as was their wont when she
                    was deeply moved. She laid her hands on his shoulders. "Oh, it's so good to be
                    loved!" she murmured. </p>
                <p>He put his arms around her, and for the moment she rested there,
                    content&mdash;yes, content, as many a woman who needed love less and craved
                    it less has been content just with being loved, when to make herself content she
                    has had to ignore and forget the personality of the man who was doing the
                    loving&mdash;and the kind of love it was. Said he: </p>
                <p>"Don't you love me a little enough to be a good woman and wait till I set up in
                    the law?" </p>
                <p>She let herself play with the idea, to prolong this novel feeling of content. She
                    asked, "How long will that be?" </p>
                <p>"I'll be admitted in two years. I'll soon have a practice. My father's got
                    influence." </p>
                <p>Susan looked at him sadly, slowly shook her head. "Two years&mdash;and then
                    several years more. And I working in a factory&mdash;or behind a
                    counter&mdash;from dawn till after dark&mdash;poor,
                    hungry&mdash;half-naked&mdash;wearing my heart out&mdash;wearing my
                    body away&mdash;" She drew away from him, laughed. "I was fooling,
                    John&mdash;about marrying. I liked to hear you say those things. I couldn't
                    marry you if I would. I'm married already." </p>
                <p>"_You_!" </p>
                <p>She nodded. </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0448" n="425"/>
                <p>"Tell me about it&mdash;won't you?" </p>
                <p>She looked at him in astonishment, so amazing seemed the idea that she could tell
                    anyone that experience. It would be like voluntarily showing a hideous,
                    repulsive scar or wound, for sometimes it was scar, and sometimes open wound,
                    and always the thing that made whatever befell her endurable by comparison. </p>
                <p>She did not answer his appeal for her confidence but went on, "Anyhow, nothing
                    could induce me to go to work again. You don't realize what work
                    means&mdash;the only sort of work I can get to do. It's&mdash;it's
                    selling both body and soul. I prefer&mdash;" </p>
                <p>He kissed her to stop her from finishing her sentence. "Don't&mdash;please,"
                    he pleaded. "You don't understand. In this life you'll soon grow hard and coarse
                    and lose your beauty and your health&mdash;and become a moral and physical
                    wreck." </p>
                <p>She reflected, the grave expression in her eyes&mdash;the expression that
                    gave whoever saw it the feeling of dread as before impending tragedy.
                    "Yes&mdash;I suppose so," she said. "But&mdash;Any sooner than as a
                    working girl living in a dirty hole in a tenement? No&mdash;not so soon. And
                    in this life I've got a chance if I'm careful of my health and&mdash;and
                    don't let things touch _me_. In that other&mdash;there's no
                    chance&mdash;none!" </p>
                <p>"What chance have you got in this life?" </p>
                <p>"I don't know exactly. I'm very ignorant yet. At worst, it's simply that I've got
                    no chance in either life&mdash;and this life is more comfortable." </p>
                <p>"Comfortable! With men you don't like frightful men&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Were you ever cold?" asked Susan. </p>
                <p>But it made no impression upon him who had no conception 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0449" n="426"/>
                    of the cold that knows
                    not how it is ever to get warm again. He rushed on: </p>
                <p>"Lorna, my God!" He caught hold of her and strained her to his breast. "You are
                    lovely and sweet! It's frightful&mdash;you in this life." </p>
                <p>Her expression made the sobs choke up into his throat. She said quietly: "Not
                    worse than dirt and vermin and freezing cold and long, long, dull&mdash;oh,
                    _so_ dull hours of working among human beings that don't ever
                    wash&mdash;because they can't." She pushed him gently away. "You don't
                    understand. You haven't been through it. Comfortable people talk like fools
                    about those things. . . . Do you remember my hands that first evening?" </p>
                <p>He reddened and his eyes shifted. "I'm absurdly sensitive about a woman's hands,"
                    he muttered. </p>
                <p>She laughed at him. "Oh, I saw&mdash;how you couldn't bear to look at
                    them&mdash;how they made you shiver. Well, the hands were
                    nothing&mdash;_nothing_!&mdash;beside what you didn't see." </p>
                <p>"Lorna, do you love someone else?" </p>
                <p>His eyes demanded an honest answer, and it seemed to her his feeling for her
                    deserved it. But she could not put the answer into words. She lowered her gaze. </p>
                <p>"Then why&mdash;" he began impetuously. But there he halted, for he knew she
                    would not lift the veil over herself, over her past. </p>
                <p>"I'm very, very fond of you," she said with depressing friendliness. Then with a
                    sweet laugh, "You ought to be glad I'm not able to take you at your word. And
                    you will be glad soon." She sighed. "What a good time we've had!" </p>
                <p>"If I only had a decent allowance, like Fatty!" he groaned. </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0450" n="427"/>
                <p>"No use talking about that. It's best for us to separate best for us both. You've
                    been good to me&mdash;you'll never know how good. And I can't play you a
                    mean trick. I wish I could be selfish enough to do it, but I can't." </p>
                <p>"You don't love me. That's the reason." </p>
                <p>"Maybe it is. Yes, I guess that's why I've got the courage to be square with you.
                    Anyhow, John, you can't afford to care for me. And if I cared for you, and put
                    off the parting&mdash;why it'd only put off what I've got to go through with
                    before&mdash;" She did not finish; her eyes became dreamy. </p>
                <p>"Before what?" he asked. </p>
                <p>"I don't know," she said, returning with a sigh. "Something I see&mdash;yet
                    don't see in the darkness, ahead of me." </p>
                <p>"I can't make you out," cried he. Her expression moved him to the same awe she
                    inspired in Etta&mdash;a feeling that gave both of them the sense of having
                    known her better, of having been more intimate with her when they first met her
                    than they ever had been since or ever would be again. </p>
                <p>When Redmond embraced and kissed her for the last time, he was in another and
                    less sympathetic mood, was busy with his own wounds to vanity and perhaps to
                    heart. He thought her heartless&mdash;good and sweet and friendly, but
                    without sentiment. She refused to help him make a scene; she refused to say she
                    would write to him, and asked him not to write to her. "You know we'll probably
                    see each other soon." </p>
                <p>"Not till the long vacation&mdash;not till nearly July." </p>
                <p>"Only three months." </p>
                <p>"Oh, if you look at it that way!" said he, piqued 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0451" n="428"/>
                    and sullen. Girls had always
                    been more than kind, more than eager, when he had shown interest. </p>
                <p>Etta, leaving on a later train, was even more depressed about Susan's heart. She
                    wept hysterically, wished Susan to do the same; but Susan stood out firmly
                    against a scene, and would not have it that Etta was shamefully deserting her,
                    as Etta tearfully accused herself. "You're going to be happy," she said. "And
                    I'm not so selfish as to be wretched about it. And don't you worry a minute on
                    my account. I'm better off in every way than I've ever been. I'll get on all
                    right." </p>
                <p>"I know you gave up John to help me with August. I know you mean to break off
                    everything. Oh, Lorna, you mustn't&mdash;you mustn't." </p>
                <p>"Don't talk nonsense," was Susan's unsatisfactory reply. </p>
                <p>When it came down to the last embrace and the last kiss, Etta did feel through
                    Susan's lips and close encircling arms a something that dried up her hysterical
                    tears and filled her heart with an awful aching. It did not last long. No matter
                    how wildly shallow waters are stirred, they soon calm and murmur placidly on
                    again. The three who had left her would have been amazed could they have seen
                    her a few minutes after Etta's train rolled out of the Union Station. The
                    difference between strong natures and weak is not that the strong are free from
                    cowardice and faint-heartedness, from doubt and foreboding, from love and
                    affection, but that they do not stay down when they are crushed down, stagger up
                    and on. </p>
                <p>Susan hurried to the room they had helped her find the day before&mdash;a
                    room in a house where no questions were asked or answered. She locked herself in
                    and gave 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0452" n="429"/>
                    way to the agonies of her loneliness. And when her grief had exhausted
                    her, she lay upon the bed staring at the wall with eyes that looked as though
                    her soul had emptied itself through them of all that makes life endurable, even
                    of hope. For the first time in her life she thought of suicide&mdash;not
                    suicide the vague possibility, not suicide the remote way of escape, but suicide
                    the close and intimate friend, the healer of all woes, the solace of all
                    griefs&mdash;suicide, the speedy, accurate solver of the worst problem
                    destiny can put to man. </p>
                <p>She saw her pocketbook on the floor where she had dropped it. "I'll wait till my
                    money's gone," thought she. Then she remembered Etta&mdash;how gentle and
                    loving she was, how utterly she gave herself&mdash;for Susan was still far
                    from the profound knowledge of character that enables us to disregard outward
                    signs in measuring actualities. "If I really weren't harder than Etta," her
                    thoughts ran on reproachfully, "I'd not wait until the money went. I'd kill
                    myself now, and have it over with." The truth was that if the position of the
                    two girls had been reversed and Susan had loved Gulick as intensely as Etta
                    professed and believed she loved him, still Susan would have given him up rather
                    than have left Etta alone. And she would have done it without any sense of
                    sacrifice. And it must be admitted that, whether or not there are those who
                    deserve credit for doing right, certainly those who do right simply because they
                    cannot do otherwise&mdash;the only trustworthy people&mdash;deserve no
                    credit for it. </p>
                <p>She counted her money&mdash;twenty-three dollars in bills, and some change.
                    Redmond had given her fifty dollars each time they had gone shopping, and had
                    made her keep the balance&mdash;his indirect way of adjusting the financial
                    side. Twenty-three dollars meant perhaps
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0453" n="430"/>
                    two weeks' living. Well, she would live
                    those two weeks decently and comfortably and then&mdash;bid life adieu
                    unless something turned up&mdash;for back to the streets she would not go.
                    With Etta gone, with not a friend anywhere on earth, life was not worth the
                    price she had paid for Etta and herself to the drunken man. Her streak of good
                    fortune in meeting Redmond had given her no illusions; from Mabel Connemora,
                    from what she herself had heard and seen&mdash;and experienced&mdash;she
                    knew the street woman's life, and she could not live that life for herself
                    alone. She could talk about it to Redmond tranquilly. She could think about it
                    in the abstract, could see how other women did it, and how those who had
                    intelligence might well survive and lift themselves up in it. But do it she
                    could not. So she resolved upon suicide, firmly believing in her own resolve.
                    And she was not one to deceive herself or to shrink from anything whatsoever.
                    Except the insane, only the young make these resolves and act upon them; for the
                    young have not yet learned to value life, have not yet fallen under life's
                    sinister spell that makes human beings cling more firmly and more cravenly to it
                    as they grow older. The young must have something&mdash;some hope, however
                    fanatic and false&mdash;to live for. They will not tarry just to live. And
                    in that hour Susan had lost hope. </p>
                <p>She took off her street dress and opened her trunk to get a wrapper and bedroom
                    slippers. As she lifted the lid, she saw an envelope addressed "Lorna"; she
                    remembered that Redmond had locked and strapped the trunk. She tore the end from
                    the envelope, looked in. Some folded bills; nothing more. She sat on the floor
                    and counted two twenties, five tens, two fives&mdash;a hundred dollars! She
                    looked dazedly at the money&mdash;gave 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0454" n="431"/>
                    a cry of delight&mdash;sprang to
                    her feet, with a change like the startling shift from night to day in the
                    tropics. </p>
                <p>"I can pay!" she cried. "I can pay!" </p>
                <p>Bubbling over with smiles and with little laughs, gay as even champagne and the
                    release from the vile prison of the slums had made her, she with eager hands
                    took from the trunk her best clothes&mdash;the jacket and skirt of dark gray
                    check she had bought for thirty dollars at Shillito's and had had altered to her
                    figure and her taste; the blouse of good quality linen with rather a fancy
                    collar; the gray leather belt with a big oxidized silver buckle; her only pair
                    of silk stockings; the pair of high-heeled patent leather shoes&mdash;the
                    large black hat with a gray feather curling attractively round and over its
                    brim. The hat had cost only fourteen dollars because she had put it together
                    herself; if she had bought it made, she would have paid not less than thirty
                    dollars. </p>
                <p>All these things she carefully unpacked and carefully laid out. Then she
                    thoroughly brushed her hair and did it up in a graceful pompadour that would go
                    well with the hat. She washed away the traces of her outburst of grief, went
                    over her finger nails, now almost recovered from the disasters incident to the
                    life of manual labor. She went on to complete her toilet, all with the same
                    attention to detail&mdash;a sure indication, in one so young, of a desire to
                    please some specific person. When she had the hat set at the satisfactory angle
                    and the veil wound upon it and draped over her fresh young face coquettishly,
                    she took from her slender store of gloves a fresh gray pair and, as she put them
                    on, stood before the glass examining herself. </p>
                <p>There was now not a trace of the tenement working girl of a week and a day
                    before. Here was beauty in

                    bloom, fresh and alluring from head to narrow,
                    well-booted feet. More than a hint of a fine color sense&mdash;that vital
                    quality, if fashion, the conventional, is to be refined and individualized into
                    style, the rare&mdash;more than a hint of color sense showed in the harmony
                    of the pearl gray in the big feather, the pearl gray in the collar of the
                    blouse, and the pearl white of her skin. Susan had indeed returned to her own
                    class. She had left it, a small-town girl with more than a suggestion of the
                    child in eyes and mouth; she had returned to it, a young woman of the city, with
                    that look in her face which only experience can give&mdash;experience that
                    has resulted in growth. She locked all her possessions away in her
                    trunk&mdash;all but her money; that she put in her
                    stockings&mdash;seventy-five dollars well down in the right leg, the rest of
                    the bills well down in the left leg; the two dollars or so in change was all she
                    intrusted to the pocketbook she carried. She cast a coquettish glance down at
                    her charmingly arrayed feet&mdash;a harmless glance of coquetry that will be
                    condemned by those whose physical vanity happens to center elsewhere. After this
                    glance she dropped her skirts&mdash;and was ready. </p>
                <p>By this time dusk had fallen, and it was nearly six o'clock. As she came out of
                    the house she glanced toward the west&mdash;the instinctive gesture of
                    people who live in rainy climates. Her face brightened; she saw an omen in the
                    long broad streak of reddened evening sky. </p>

                <p> SHE went down to Fourth Street, along it to Race, to the _Commercial_ building.
                    At the entrance to the corridor at the far side of which were elevator and
                    stairway, she paused and considered. She turned into the business office. </p>
                <p>"Is Mr. Roderick Spenser here?" she asked of a heavily built, gray-bearded man in
                    the respectable black of the old-fashioned financial employee, showing the
                    sobriety and stolidity of his character in his dress. </p>
                <p>"He works upstairs," replied the old man, beaming approvingly upon the pretty,
                    stylish young woman. </p>
                <p>"Is he there now?" </p>
                <p>"I'll telephone." He went into the rear office, presently returned with the news
                    that Mr. Spenser had that moment left, was probably on his way down in the
                    elevator. "And you'll catch him if you go to the office entrance right away." </p>
                <p>Susan, the inexperienced in the city ways of men with women, did not appreciate
                    what a tribute to her charms and to her character, as revealed in the honest,
                    grave eyes, was the old man's unhesitating assumption that Spenser would wish to
                    see her. She lost no time in retracing her steps. As she reached the office
                    entrance she saw at the other end of the long hall two young men coming out of
                    the elevator. After the habit of youth, she had rehearsed speech and manner for
                    this meeting; but at sight of him she was straightway trembling so that she
                    feared she would be unable to speak at all. The entrance light was dim, but as
                    he 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0457" n="434"/>
                    glanced at her in passing he saw her looking at him and his hand moved toward
                    his hat. His face had not changed&mdash;the same frank, careless expression,
                    the same sympathetic, understanding look out of the eyes. But he was the city
                    man in dress now&mdash;notably the city man. </p>
                <p>"Mr. Spenser," said she shyly. </p>
                <p>He halted; his companion went on. He lifted his hat, looked inquiringly at
                    her&mdash;the look of the enthusiast and connoisseur on the subject of
                    pretty women, when he finds a new specimen worthy of his attention. </p>
                <p>"Don't you know me?" </p>
                <p>His expression of puzzled and flirtatious politeness gradually cleared away. The
                    lighting up of his eyes, the smile round his mouth delighted her; and she grew
                    radiant when he exclaimed eagerly, "Why, it's the little girl of the rock again!
                    How you've grown&mdash;in a year&mdash;less than a year!" </p>
                <p>"Yes, I suppose I have," said she, thinking of it for the first time. Then, to
                    show him at once what a good excuse she had for intruding again, she hastened to
                    add, "I've come to pay you that money you loaned me." </p>
                <p>He burst out laughing, drew her into the corridor where the light was brighter.
                    "And you've gone back to your husband," he said&mdash;she noted the quick,
                    sharp change in his voice. </p>
                <p>"Why do you think that?" she said. </p>
                <p>The way his eyes lingered upon the charming details toilet that indicated
                    anything but poverty might of a have given her a simple explanation. He offered
                    another. </p>
                <p>"I can't explain. It's your different expression&mdash;a kind of experienced
                    look." </p>
                <p>The color flamed and flared in Susan's face. </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0458" n="435"/>
                <p>"You are&mdash;happy?" he asked. </p>
                <p>"I've not seen&mdash;him," evaded she. "Ever since I left Carrollton I've
                    been wandering about." </p>
                <p>"Wandering about?" he repeated absently, his eyes busy with her appearance. </p>
                <p>"And now," she went on, nervous and hurried, "I'm here in town&mdash;for a
                    while." </p>
                <p>"Then I may come to see you?" </p>
                <p>"I'd be glad. I'm alone in a furnished room I've taken&mdash;out near Lincoln
                    Park." </p>
                <p>"Alone! You don't mean you're still wandering?" </p>
                <p>"Still wandering." </p>
                <p>He laughed. "Well, it certainly is doing you no harm. The reverse." An
                    embarrassed pause, then he said with returning politeness: "Maybe you'll dine
                    with me this evening?" </p>
                <p>She beamed. "I've been hoping you'd ask me." </p>
                <p>"It won't be as good as the one on the rock." </p>
                <p>"There never will be another dinner like that," declared she. "Your leg is well?" </p>
                <p>Her question took him by surprise. In his interest and wonder as to the new
                    mystery of this mysterious young person he had not recalled the excuses he made
                    for dropping out of the entanglement in which his impulses had put him. The
                    color poured into his face. "Ages ago," he replied, hurriedly. "I'd have
                    forgotten it, if it hadn't been for you. I've never been able to get you out of
                    my head." And as a matter of truth she had finally dislodged his cousin
                    Nell&mdash;without lingering long or vividly herself. Young Mr. Spenser was
                    too busy and too self-absorbed a man to bother long about any one flower in a
                    world that was one vast field abloom with open-petaled flowers. </p>
                <p>"Nor I you," said she, as pleased as he had expected, 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0459" n="436"/>
                    and showing it with a
                    candor that made her look almost the child he had last seen. "You see, I owed
                    you that money, and I wanted to pay it." </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;_that_ was all!" exclaimed he, half jokingly. "Wait here a minute."
                    And he went to the door, looked up and down the street, then darted across it
                    and disappeared into the St. Nicholas Hotel. He was not gone more than half a
                    minute. </p>
                <p>"I had to see Bayne and tell him," he explained when he was with her again. "I
                    was to have dined with him and some others&mdash;over in the cafe. Instead,
                    you and I will dine upstairs. You won't mind my not being dressed?" </p>
                <p>It seemed to her he was dressed well enough for any occasion. "I'd rather you had
                    on the flannel trousers rolled up to your knees," said she. "But I can imagine
                    them." </p>
                <p>"What a dinner that was!" cried he. "And the ride afterward," with an effort at
                    ease that escaped her bedazzled eyes. "Why didn't you ever write?" </p>
                <p>He expected her to say that she did not know his address, and was ready with
                    protests and excuses. But she replied: </p>
                <p>"I didn't have the money to pay what I owed you." They were crossing Fourth
                    Street and ascending the steps to the hotel. "Then,
                    too&mdash;afterward&mdash;when I got to know a little more about life
                    I&mdash;Oh, no matter. Really, the money was the only reason." </p>
                <p>But he had stopped short. In a tone so correctly sincere that a suspicious person
                    might perhaps have doubted the sincerity of the man using it, he said: </p>
                <p>"What was in your mind? What did you think? What did you&mdash;suspect me of?
                    For I see in that honest, telltale face of yours that it was a suspicion." </p>
               
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0460" n="437"/>
                <p>"I didn't blame you," protested the girl, "even if it was so. I thought maybe you
                    got to thinking it over&mdash;and&mdash;didn't want to be bothered with
                    anyone so troublesome as I had made myself." </p>
                <p>"How _could_ you suspect _me_ of such a thing?" </p>
                <p>"Oh, I really didn't," declared she, with all the earnestness of a generous
                    nature, for she read into his heightened color and averted eyes the feelings she
                    herself would have had before an unjust suspicion. "It was merely an idea. And I
                    didn't blame you&mdash;not in the least. It would have been the
                    sensible&mdash;" </p>
                <p>Next thing, this child-woman, this mysterious mind of mixed precocity and
                    innocence, would be showing that she had guessed a Cousin Nell. </p>
                <p>"You are far too modest," interrupted he with a flirtatious smile. "You didn't
                    realize how strong an impression you made. No, I really broke my leg. Don't you
                    suppose I knew the twenty-five in the pocketbook wouldn't carry you far?" He
                    saw&mdash;and naturally misunderstood&mdash;her sudden change of
                    expression as he spoke of the amount. He went on apologetically, "I intended to
                    bring more when I came. I was afraid to put money in the note for fear it'd
                    never be delivered, if I did. And didn't I tell you to write&mdash;and
                    didn't I give you my address here? Would I have done that, if I hadn't meant to
                    stand by you?" </p>
                <p>Susan was convinced, was shamed by these smooth, plausible assertions and
                    explanations. "Your father's house&mdash;it's a big brick, with stone
                    trimmings, standing all alone outside the little town&mdash;isn't it?" </p>
                <p>Spenser was again coloring deeply. "Yes," admitted he uneasily. </p>
                <p>But Susan didn't notice. "I saw the doctor&mdash;and your family&mdash;on
                    the veranda," she said. </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0461" n="438"/>
                <p>He was now so nervous that she could not but observe it. "They gave out that it
                    was only a sprain," said he, "because I told them I didn't want it known. I
                    didn't want the people at the office to know I was going to be laid up so long.
                    I was afraid I'd lose my job." </p>
                <p>"I didn't hear anything about it," said she. "I only saw as I was going by on a
                    boat." </p>
                <p>He looked disconcerted&mdash;but not to her eyes. "Well&mdash;it's far in
                    the past now," said he. "Let's forget&mdash;all but the fun." </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;all but the fun." Then very sweetly, "But I'll never forget what I
                    owe you. Not the money&mdash;not that, hardly at all&mdash;but what you
                    did for me. It made me able to go on." </p>
                <p>"Don't speak of it," cried he, flushed and shamefaced. "I didn't do half what I
                    ought." Like most human beings he was aware of his more obvious&mdash;if
                    less dangerous&mdash;faults and weaknesses. He liked to be called generous,
                    but always had qualms when so called because he knew he was in fact of the
                    familiar type classed as generous only because human beings are so artless in
                    their judgments as to human nature that they cannot see that quick impulses
                    quickly die. The only deep truth is that there are no generous natures but just
                    natures&mdash;and they are rarely classed as generous because their slowly
                    formed resolves have the air of prudence and calculation. </p>
                <p>In the hotel she went to the dressing-room, took twenty-five dollars from the
                    money in her stocking. As soon as they were seated in the restaurant she handed
                    it to him. </p>
                <p>"But this makes it you who are having me to dinner&mdash;and more," he
                    protested. </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0462" n="439"/>
                <p>"If you knew what a weight it's been on me, you'd not talk that way," said she. </p>
                <p>Her tone compelled him to accept her view of the matter. He laughed and put the
                    money in his waistcoat pocket, saying: "Then I'll still owe you a dinner." </p>
                <p>During the past week she had been absorbing as only a young woman with a good
                    mind and a determination to learn the business of living can absorb. The lessons
                    before her had been the life that is lived in cities by those who have money to
                    spend and experience in spending it; she had learned out of all proportion to
                    opportunity. At a glance she realized that she was now in a place far superior
                    to the Bohemian resorts which had seemed to her inexperience the best possible.
                    From earliest childhood she had shown the delicate sense of good taste and of
                    luxury that always goes with a practical imagination&mdash;practical as
                    distinguished from the idealistic kind of imagination that is vague, erratic,
                    and fond of the dreams which neither could nor should come true. And the reading
                    she had done&mdash;the novels, the memoirs, the books of travel, the fashion
                    and home magazines&mdash;had made deep and distinct impressions upon her,
                    had prepared her&mdash;as they have prepared thousands of Americans in
                    secluded towns and rural regions where luxury and even comfort are very crude
                    indeed&mdash;for the possible rise of fortune that is the universal American
                    dream and hope. She felt these new surroundings exquisitely&mdash;the
                    subdued coloring, the softened lights, the thick carpets, the quiet elegance and
                    comfort of the furniture. She noted the good manners of the well-trained waiter;
                    she listened admiringly and memorizingly as Spenser ordered the
                    dinner&mdash;a dinner of French good taste&mdash;small but fine oysters,
                    a thick soup, a guinea hen _en casserole_, a fruit 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0463" n="440"/>
                    salad, fresh strawberry ice
                    cream, dry champagne. She saw that Spenser knew what he was about, and she was
                    delighted with him and proud to be with him and glad that he had tastes like her
                    own&mdash;that is, tastes such as she proposed to learn to have. Of the men
                    she had known or known about he seemed to her far and away the best. It isn't
                    necessary to explain into what an attitude of mind and heart this feeling of his
                    high superiority immediately put her&mdash;certainly not for the
                    enlightenment of any woman. </p>
                <p>"What are you thinking?" he asked&mdash;the question that was so often thrust
                    at her because, when she thought intensely, there was a curiosity-compelling
                    expression in her eyes. </p>
                <p>"Oh&mdash;about all this," replied she. "I like this sort of thing so much. I
                    never had it in my life, yet now that I see it I feel as if I were part of it,
                    as if it must belong to me." Her eyes met his sympathetic gaze. "You understand,
                    don't you?" He nodded. "And I was wondering"&mdash;she laughed, as if she
                    expected even him to laugh at her&mdash;"I was wondering how long it would
                    be before I should possess it. Do you think I'm crazy?" </p>
                <p>He shook his head. "I've got that same feeling," said he. "I'm
                    poor&mdash;don't dare do this often&mdash;have all I can manage in
                    keeping myself decently. Yet I have a conviction that I shall&mdash;shall
                    win. Don't think I'm dreaming of being rich&mdash;not at all. I&mdash;I
                    don't care much about that if I did go into business. But I want all my
                    surroundings to be right." </p>
                <p>Her eyes gleamed. "And you'll get it. And so shall I. I know it sounds improbable
                    and absurd for me to say that about myself. But&mdash;I know it." </p>
                <p>"I believe you," said he. "You've got the look in 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0464" n="441"/>
                    your face&mdash;in your
                    eyes. . . . I've never seen anyone improve as you have in this less than a
                    year." </p>
                <p>She smiled as she thought in what surroundings she had apparently spent
                    practically all that time. "If you could have seen me!" she said. "Yes, I was
                    learning and I know it. I led a sort of double life. I&mdash;" she
                    hesitated, gave up trying to explain. She had not the words and phrases, the
                    clear-cut ideas, to express that inner life led by people who have real
                    imagination. With most human beings their immediate visible surroundings
                    determine their life; with the imaginative few their horizon is always the whole
                    wide world. </p>
                <p>She sighed, "But I'm ignorant. I don't know how or where to take hold." </p>
                <p>"I can't help you there, yet," said he. "When we know each other better, then
                    I'll know. Not that you need me to tell you. You'll find out for yourself. One
                    always does." </p>
                <p>She glanced round the attractive room again, then looked at him with narrowed
                    eyelids. "Only a few hours ago I was thinking of suicide. How absurd it seems
                    now!&mdash;I'll never do that again. At least, I've learned how to profit by
                    a lesson. Mr. Burlingham taught me that." </p>
                <p>"Who's he?" </p>
                <p>"That's a long story. I don't feel like telling about it now." </p>
                <p>But the mere suggestion had opened certain doors in her memory and crowds of sad
                    and bitter thoughts came trooping in. </p>
                <p>"Are you in some sort of trouble?" said he, instantly leaning toward her across
                    the table and all aglow with the impulsive sympathy that kindles in
                    impressionable 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0465" n="442"/>
                    natures as quickly as fire in dry grass. Such natures are as
                    perfect conductors of emotion as platinum is of heat&mdash;instantly
                    absorbing it, instantly throwing it off, to return to their normal and metallic
                    chill&mdash;and capacity for receptiveness. "Anything you can tell me
                    about?" </p>
                <p>"Oh, no&mdash;nothing especial," replied she. "Just loneliness and a feeling
                    of&mdash;of discouragement." Strongly, "Just a mood. I'm never really
                    discouraged. Something always turns up." </p>
                <p>"Please tell me what happened after I left you at that wretched hotel." </p>
                <p>"I can't," she said. "At least, not now." </p>
                <p>"There is&mdash;" He looked sympathetically at her, as if to assure her that
                    he would understand, no matter what she might confess. "There
                    is&mdash;someone?" </p>
                <p>"No. I'm all alone. I'm&mdash;free." It was not in the least degree an
                    instinct for deception that made her then convey an impression of there having
                    been no one. She was simply obeying her innate reticence that was part of her
                    unusual self-unconsciousness. </p>
                <p>"And you're not worried about&mdash;about money matters?" he asked. "You see,
                    I'm enough older and more experienced to give me excuse for asking. Besides,
                    unless a woman has money, she doesn't find it easy to get on." </p>
                <p>"I've enough for the present," she assured him, and the stimulus of the champagne
                    made her look&mdash;and feel&mdash;much more self-confident than she
                    really was. "More than I've ever had before. So I'm not worried. When anyone has
                    been through what I have they aren't so scared about the future." </p>
                <p>He looked the admiration he felt&mdash;and there was not a little of the
                    enthusiasm of the champagne both 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0466" n="443"/>
                    in the look and in the admiration&mdash;"I
                    see you've already learned to play the game without losing your nerve." </p>
                <p>"I begin to hope so," said she. </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;you've got the signs of success in your face. Curious about those
                    signs. Once you learn to know them, you never miss in sizing up people." </p>
                <p>The dinner had come. Both were hungry, and it was as good a dinner as the
                    discussion about it between Spenser and the waiter had forecast. As they ate the
                    well-cooked, well-served food and drank the delicately flavored champagne,
                    mellow as the gorgeous autumn its color suggested, there diffused through them
                    an extraordinary feeling of quiet intense happiness&mdash;happiness of mind
                    and body. Her face took on a new and finer beauty; into his face came a
                    tenderness that was most becoming to its rather rugged features. And he had not
                    talked with her long before he discovered that he was facing not a child, not a
                    childwoman, but a woman grown, one who could understand and appreciate the
                    things men and women of experience say and do. </p>
                <p>"I've always been expecting to hear from you every day since we separated," he
                    said&mdash;and he was honestly believing it now. "I've had a feeling that
                    you hadn't forgotten me. It didn't seem possible I could feel so strongly unless
                    there was real sympathy between us." </p>
                <p>"I came as soon as I could." </p>
                <p>He reflected in silence a moment, then in a tone that made her heart leap and her
                    blood tingle, he said: "You say you're free?" </p>
                <p>"Free as air. Only&mdash;I couldn't fly far." </p>
                <p>He hesitated on an instinct of prudence, then ventured. "Far as New York?" </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0467" n="444"/>
                <p>"What is the railroad fare?" </p>
                <p>"Oh, about twenty-five dollars&mdash;with sleeper." </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;I can fly that far." </p>
                <p>"Do you mean to say you've no ties of any kind?" </p>
                <p>"None. Not one." Her eyes opened wide and her nostrils dilated. "Free!" </p>
                <p>"You love it&mdash;don't you?" </p>
                <p>"Don't you?" </p>
                <p>"Above everything!" he exclaimed. "Only the free _live_." </p>
                <p>She lifted her head higher in a graceful, attractive gesture of confidence and
                    happiness. "Well&mdash;I am ready to live." </p>
                <p>"I'm afraid you don't realize," he said hesitatingly. "People wouldn't
                    understand. You've your reputation to think of, you know." </p>
                <p>She looked straight at him. "No&mdash;not even that. I'm even free from
                    reputation." Then, as his face saddened and his eyes glistened with sympathy,
                    "You needn't pity me. See where it's brought me." </p>
                <p>"You're a strong swimmer&mdash;aren't you?" he said tenderly. "But then there
                    isn't any safe and easy crossing to the isles of freedom. It's no wonder most
                    people don't get further than gazing and longing." </p>
                <p>"Probably I shouldn't," confessed Susan, "if I hadn't been thrown into the water.
                    It was a case of swim or drown." </p>
                <p>"But most who try are drowned&mdash;nearly all the women." </p>
                <p>"Oh, I guess there are more survive than is generally supposed. So much lying is
                    done about that sort of thing." </p>
                <p>"What a shrewd young lady it is! At any rate, you have reached the islands." </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0468" n="445"/>
                <p>"But I'm not queen of them yet," she reminded him. "I'm only a poor, naked,
                    out-of-breath castaway lying on the beach." </p>
                <p>He laughed appreciatively. Very clever, this extremely pretty young woman.
                    "Yes&mdash;you'll win. You'll be queen." He lifted his champagne glass and
                    watched the little bubbles pushing gayly and swiftly upward.
                    "So&mdash;you've cast over your reputation." </p>
                <p>"I told you I had reached the beach naked." A reckless light in her eyes now.
                    "Fact is, I had none to start with. Anybody has a reason for
                    starting&mdash;or for being started. That was mine, I guess." </p>
                <p>"I've often thought about that matter of reputation&mdash;in a man or a
                    woman&mdash;if they're trying to make the bold, strong swim. To care about
                    one's reputation means fear of what the world says. It's important to care about
                    one's character&mdash;for without character no one ever got anywhere worth
                    getting to. But it's very, very dangerous to be afraid for one's reputation.
                    And&mdash;I hate to admit it, because I'm hopelessly conventional at bottom,
                    but it's true&mdash;reputation&mdash;fear of what the world
                    says&mdash;has sunk more swimmers, has wrecked more characters than it ever
                    helped. So&mdash;the strongest and best swimmers swim naked." </p>
                <p>Susan was looking thoughtfully at him over the rim of her glass. She took a sip
                    of the champagne, said: "If I hadn't been quite naked, I'd have
                    sunk&mdash;I'd have been at the bottom&mdash;with the fishes&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Don't!" he cried. "Thank God, you did whatever you've done&mdash;yes, I mean
                    that&mdash;whatever you've done, since it enabled you to swim on." He added,
                    "And I know it wasn't anything bad&mdash;anything unwomanly." </p>
                <p>"I did the best I could&mdash;nothing I'm ashamed of&mdash;or proud of
                    either. Just&mdash;what I had to do." </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0469" n="446"/>
                <p>"But you ought to be proud that you arrived." </p>
                <p>"No&mdash;only glad," said she. "So&mdash;so _frightfully_ glad!" </p>
                <p>In any event, their friendship was bound to flourish; aided by that dinner and
                    that wine it sprang up into an intimacy, a feeling of mutual trust and of
                    sympathy at every point. Like all women she admired strength in a man above
                    everything else. She delighted in the thick obstinate growth of his fair hair,
                    in the breadth of the line of his eyebrows, in the aggressive thrust of his
                    large nose and long jawbone. She saw in the way his mouth closed evidence of a
                    will against which opposition would dash about as dangerously as an egg against
                    a stone wall. There was no question of his having those birthmarks of success
                    about which he talked. She saw them&mdash;saw nothing of the less
                    obtrusive&mdash;but not less important&mdash;marks of weakness which
                    might have enabled an expert in the reading of faces to reach some rather
                    depressing conclusion as to the nature and the degree of that success. </p>
                <p>Finally, he burst out with, "Yes, I've made up my mind. I'll do it! I'm going to
                    New York. I've been fooling away the last five years here learning a lot, but
                    still idling&mdash;drinking&mdash;amusing myself in all kinds of ways.
                    And about a month ago&mdash;one night, as I was rolling home toward
                    dawn&mdash;through a driving sleet storm&mdash;do you remember a line in
                    `Paradise Lost'" </p>
                <p>"I never read it," interrupted Susan. </p>
                <p>"Well&mdash;it's where the devils have been kicked out of Heaven and are
                    lying in agony flat on the burning lake&mdash;and Satan rises
                    up&mdash;and marches haughtily out among them&mdash;and calls out,
                    `Awake! Arise! Or forever more be damned!' That's what has happened to me
                    several times in my life. When I was a boy, idling 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0470" n="447"/>
                    about the farm and wasting
                    myself, that voice came to me&mdash;`Awake! Arise! Or forever more be
                    damned!' And I got a move on me, and insisted on going to college.
                    Again&mdash;at college&mdash;I became a
                    dawdler&mdash;poker&mdash;drink&mdash;dances&mdash;all the rest
                    of it. And suddenly that voice roared in my ears, made me jump like a rabbit
                    when a gun goes off. And last month it came again. I went to
                    work&mdash;finished a play I've been pottering over for three years. But
                    somehow I couldn't find the&mdash;the&mdash;whatever I
                    needed&mdash;to make me break away. Well&mdash;_you've_ given me that.
                    I'll resign from the _Commercial_ and with all I've got in the
                    world&mdash;three hundred dollars and a trunk full of good clothes, I'll
                    break into Broadway." </p>
                <p>Susan had listened with bright eyes and quickened breath, as intoxicated and as
                    convinced as was he by his eloquence. "Isn't that splendid!" she exclaimed in a
                    low voice. </p>
                <p>"And you?" he said meaningly. </p>
                <p>"I?" she replied, fearing she was misunderstanding. </p>
                <p>"Will you go?" </p>
                <p>"Do you want me?" she asked, low and breathlessly. </p>
                <p>With a reluctance which suggested&mdash;but not to her&mdash;that his
                    generosity was winning a hard-fought battle with his vanity, he replied: "I need
                    you. I doubt if I'd dare, without you to back me up." </p>
                <p>"I've got a trunk full of fairly good clothes and about a hundred dollars. But I
                    haven't got any play&mdash;or any art&mdash;or any trade even. Of
                    course, I'll go." Then she hastily added, "I'll not be a drag on you. I pay my
                    own way." </p>
                <p>"But you mustn't be suspicious in your independence," he warned her. "You mustn't
                    forget that I'm older than you and more experienced and that it's far 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0471" n="448"/>
                    easier for
                    a man to get money than for a woman." </p>
                <p>"To get it without lowering himself?" </p>
                <p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, looking strangely at her. "You mean, without bowing to some
                    boss? Without selling his soul? I had no idea you were so much of a woman when I
                    met you that day." </p>
                <p>"I wasn't&mdash;then," replied she. "And I didn't know where I'd got till we
                    began to talk this evening." </p>
                <p>"And you're very young!" </p>
                <p>"Oh, but I've been going to a school where they make you learn fast." </p>
                <p>"Indeed I do need you." He touched his glass to hers. "On to Broadway!" he cried. </p>
                <p>"Broadway!" echoed she, radiant. </p>
                <p>"Together&mdash;eh?" </p>
                <p>She nodded. But as she drank the toast a tear splashed into her glass. She was
                    remembering how some mysterious instinct had restrained her from going with John
                    Redmond, though it seemed the only sane thing to do. What if she had disobeyed
                    that instinct! And then&mdash;through her mind in swift ghostly
                    march&mdash;past trailed the persons and events of the days just
                    gone&mdash;just gone, yet seeming as far away as a former life in another
                    world. Redmond and Gulick&mdash;Etta&mdash;yes, Etta, too&mdash;all
                    past and gone&mdash;forever gone&mdash; </p>
                <p>"What are you thinking about?" </p>
                <p>She shook her head and the spectral procession vanished into the glooms of
                    memory's vistas. "Thinking?&mdash;of yesterday. I don't understand
                    myself&mdash;how I shake off and forget what's past. Nothing seems real to
                    me but the future." </p>
                <p>"Not even the present?" said he with a smile. </p>
                <p>"Not even the present," she answered with grave candor. "Nothing seems to touch
                    me&mdash;the real me. 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0472" n="449"/>
                    &mdash;like looking out of the window of
                    the train at the landscape running by. I'm a traveler passing through. I wonder
                    if it'll always be that way. I wonder if I'll ever arrive where I'll feel that I
                    belong." </p>
                <p>"I think so&mdash;and soon." </p>
                <p>But she did not respond to his confident smile. "I&mdash;I hope so," she said
                    with sad, wistful sweetness. "Then again&mdash;aren't there some people who
                    don't belong anywhere&mdash;aren't allowed to settle down and be happy, but
                    have to keep going&mdash;on and on&mdash;until&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Until they pass out into the dark," he finished for her. "Yes." He looked at her
                    in a wondering uneasy way. "You do suggest that kind," said he. "But,"
                    smilingly, to hide his earnestness, "I'll try to detain you." </p>
                <p>"Please do," she said. "I don't want to go on&mdash;alone." </p>
                <p>He dropped into silence, puzzled and in a way awed by the mystery enveloping
                    her&mdash;a mystery of aloofness and stoniness, of complete separation from
                    the contact of the world&mdash;the mystery that incloses all whose real life
                    is lived deep within themselves. </p>

                <p> LIKE days later, on the Eastern Express, they were not so confident as they had
                    been over the St. Nicholas champagne. As confident about the remoter future, it
                    was that annoying little stretch near at hand which gave them secret uneasiness.
                    There had been nothing but dreaming and sentimentalizing in those four
                    days&mdash;and that disquietingly suggested the soldier who with an
                    impressive flourish highly resolves to give battle, then sheathes his sword and
                    goes away to a revel. Also, like all idlers, they had spent money&mdash;far
                    more money than total net cash resources of less than five hundred dollars
                    warranted. </p>
                <p>"We've spent an awful lot of money," said Susan. </p>
                <p>She was quick to see the faint frown, the warning that she was on dangerous
                    ground. Said he: </p>
                <p>"Do you regret?" </p>
                <p>"No, indeed&mdash;no!" cried she, eager to have that cloud vanish, but honest
                    too. </p>
                <p>She no more than he regretted a single moment of the dreaming and love-making, a
                    single penny of the eighty and odd dollars that had enabled them fittingly to
                    embower their romance, to twine myrtle in their hair and to provide Cupid's
                    torch-bowls with fragrant incense. Still&mdash;with the battle not begun,
                    there gaped that deep, wide hollow in the war chest. </p>
                <p>Spenser's newspaper connection got them passes over one of the cheaper lines to
                    New York&mdash;and he tried to console himself by setting this down as a
                    saving of forty dollars against the eighty dollars of the debit
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0474" n="451"/>
                    item. But he
                    couldn't altogether forget that they would have traveled on passes, anyhow. He
                    was not regretting that he had indulged in the extravagance of a
                    stateroom&mdash;but he couldn't deny that it was an extravagance. However,
                    he had only to look at her to feel that he had done altogether well in providing
                    for her the best, and to believe that he could face with courage any fate so
                    long as he had her at his side. </p>
                <p>"Yes, I can face anything with you," he said. "What I feel for you is the real
                    thing. The real thing, at last." </p>
                <p>She had no disposition to inquire curiously into this. Her reply was a flash of a
                    smile that was like a flash of glorious light upon the crest of a wave surging
                    straight from her happy heart. </p>
                <p>They were opposite each other at breakfast in the restaurant car. He delighted in
                    her frank delight in the novelty of travel&mdash;swift and luxurious travel.
                    He had never been East before, himself, but he had had experience of sleepers
                    and diners; she had not, and every moment she was getting some new sensation.
                    She especially enjoyed this sitting at breakfast with the express train rushing
                    smoothly along through the mountains&mdash;the first mountains either had
                    seen. At times they were so intensely happy that they laughed with tears in
                    their eyes and touched hands across the table to get from physical contact the
                    reassurances of reality. </p>
                <p>"How good to eat everything is!" she exclaimed. "You'll think me very greedy, I'm
                    afraid. But if you'd eaten the stuff I have since we dined on the rock!" </p>
                <p>They were always going back to the rock, and neither wearied of recalling and
                    reminding each other of the 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0475" n="452"/>
                    smallest details. It seemed to them that everything,
                    even the least happening, at that sacred spot must be remembered, must be
                    recorded indelibly in the book of their romance. "I'm glad we were happy
                    together in such circumstances," she went on. "It was a test&mdash;wasn't
                    it, Rod?" </p>
                <p>"If two people don't love each other enough to be happy anywhere, they could be
                    happy nowhere," declared he. </p>
                <p>"So, we'll not mind being very, very careful about spending money in New York,"
                    she ventured&mdash;for she was again bringing up the subject she had been
                    privately revolving ever since they had formed the partnership. In her
                    wanderings with Burlingham, in her sojourn in the tenements, she had learned a
                    great deal about the care and spending of money&mdash;had developed that
                    instinct for forehandedness which nature has implanted in all normal women along
                    with the maternal instinct&mdash;and as a necessary supplement to it. This
                    instinct is more or less futile in most women because they are more or less
                    ignorant of the realities as to wise and foolish expenditure. But it is found in
                    the most extravagant women no less than in the most absurdly and meanly stingy. </p>
                <p>"Of course, we must be careful," assented Rod. "But I can't let you be
                    uncomfortable." </p>
                <p>"Now, dear," she remonstrated, "you mustn't treat me that way. I'm better fitted
                    for hardship than you. I'd mind it less." </p>
                <p>He laughed; she looked so fine and delicate, with her transparent skin and her
                    curves of figure, he felt that anything so nearly perfect could not but easily
                    be spoiled. And there he showed how little he appreciated her iron strength, her
                    almost exhaustless endurance. 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0476" n="453"/>
                    He fancied he was the stronger because he could
                    have crushed her in his muscular arms. But exposures, privations, dissipations
                    that would have done for a muscularly stronger man than he would have left no
                    trace upon her after a few days of rest and sleep. </p>
                <p>"It's the truth," she insisted. "I could prove it, but I shan't. I don't want to
                    remember vividly. Rod, we _must_ live cheaply in New York until you sell a play
                    and I have a place in some company." </p>
                <p>"Yes," he conceded. "But, Susie, not too cheap. A cheap way of living makes a
                    cheap man&mdash;gives a man a cheap outlook on life. Besides, don't
                    forget&mdash;if the worst comes to the worst, I can always get a job on a
                    newspaper." </p>
                <p>She would not have let him see how uneasy this remark made her. However, she
                    could not permit it to pass without notice. Said she a little nervously: </p>
                <p>"But you've made up your mind to devote yourself to plays&mdash;to stand or
                    fall by that." </p>
                <p>He remembered how he had thrilled her and himself with brave talk about the
                    necessity of concentrating, of selecting a goal and moving relentlessly for it,
                    letting nothing halt him or turn him aside. For his years Rod Spenser was as
                    wise in the philosophy of success as Burlingham or Tom Brashear. But he had done
                    that brave and wise talking before he loved her as he now did&mdash;before
                    he realized how love can be in itself an achievement and a possession so great
                    that other ambitions dwarf beside it. True, away back in his facile, fickle
                    mind, behind the region where self-excuse and somebody-else-always-to-blame
                    reigned supreme, a something&mdash;the something that had set the marks of
                    success so strongly upon his face&mdash;was whispering to him the real
                    reason for his now revolving a New York 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0477" n="454"/>
                    newspaper job. Real reasons as
                    distinguished from alleged reasons and imagined reasons, from the reasons
                    self-deception invents and vanity gives out&mdash;real reasons are always
                    interesting and worth noting. What was Rod's? Not his love for her; nothing so
                    superior, so superhuman as that. No, it was weak and wobbly misgivings as to his
                    own ability to get on independently, the misgivings that menace every man who
                    has never worked for himself but has always drawn pay&mdash;the misgivings
                    that paralyze most men and keep them wage or salary slaves all their lives. Rod
                    was no better pleased at this sly, unwelcome revelation of his real self to
                    himself than the next human being is in similar circumstances. The whispering
                    was hastily suppressed; love for her, desire that she should be
                    comfortable&mdash;those must be the real reasons. But he must be careful
                    lest she, the sensitive, should begin to brood over a fear that she was already
                    weakening him and would become a drag upon him&mdash;the fear that, he knew,
                    would take shape in his own mind if things began to go badly. "You may be sure,
                    dearest," he said, "I'll do nothing that won't help me on." He tapped his
                    forehead with his finger. "This is a machine for making plays. Everything that's
                    put into it will be grist for it." </p>
                <p>She was impressed but not convinced. He had made his point about concentration
                    too clear to her intelligence. She persisted: </p>
                <p>"But you said if you took a place on a newspaper it would make you fight less
                    hard." </p>
                <p>"I say a lot of things," he interrupted laughingly. "Don't be frightened about
                    me. What I'm most afraid of is that you'll desert me. _That_ would be a real
                    knock-out blow." </p>
                
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0478" n="455"/>
                <p>He said this smilingly; but she could not bear jokes on that one subject. </p>
                <p>"What do you mean, Rod?" </p>
                <p>"Now, don't look so funereal, Susie. I simply meant that I hate to think of your
                    going on the stage&mdash;or at anything else. I want you to help _me_.
                    Selfish, isn't it? But, dear heart, if I could feel that the plays were _ours_,
                    that we were both concentrated on the one career&mdash;darling. To love each
                    other, to work together&mdash;not separately but together&mdash;don't
                    you understand?" </p>
                <p>Her expression showed that she understood, but was not at all in sympathy. "I've
                    got to earn my living, Rod," she objected. "I shan't care anything about what
                    I'll be doing. I'll do it simply to keep from being a burden to you&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"A burden, Susie! You! Why, you're my wings that enable me to fly. It's selfish,
                    but I want all of you. Don't you think, dear, that if it were possible, it would
                    be better for you to make us a home and hold the fort while I go out to give
                    battle to managers&mdash;and bind up my wounds when I come
                    back&mdash;and send me out the next day well again? Don't you think we ought
                    to concentrate?" </p>
                <p>The picture appealed to her. All she wanted in life now was his success. "But,"
                    she objected, "it's useless to talk of that until we get on our
                    feet&mdash;perfectly useless." </p>
                <p>"It's true," he admitted with a sigh. </p>
                <p>"And until we do, we must be economical." </p>
                <p>"What a persistent lady it is," laughed he. "I wish I were like that." </p>
                <p>In the evening's gathering dusk the train steamed into Jersey City; and Spenser
                    and Susan Lenox, with the adventurer's mingling hope and dread, confidence 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0479" n="456"/>
                    and
                    doubt, courage and fear, followed the crowd down the long platform under the
                    vast train shed, went through the huge thronged waiting-room and aboard the
                    giant ferryboat which filled both with astonishment because of its size and
                    luxuriousness. </p>
                <p>"I am a jay!" said she. "I can hardly keep my mouth from dropping open." </p>
                <p>"You haven't any the advantage of me," he assured her. "Are you trembling all
                    over?" </p>
                <p>"Yes," she admitted. "And my heart's like lead. I suppose there are thousands on
                    thousands like us, from all over the country&mdash;who come here every
                    day&mdash;feeling as we do. " </p>
                <p>"Let's go out on the front deck&mdash;where we can see it." </p>
                <p>They went out on the upper front deck and, leaning against the forward gates,
                    with their traveling bags at their feet, they stood dumb before the most
                    astounding and most splendid scene in the civilized world. It was not quite dark
                    yet; the air was almost July hot, as one of those prematurely warm days New York
                    so often has in March. The sky, a soft and delicate blue shading into opal and
                    crimson behind them, displayed a bright crescent moon as it arched over the
                    fairyland in the dusk before them. Straight ahead, across the broad, swift,
                    sparkling river&mdash;the broadest water Susan had ever seen&mdash;rose
                    the mighty, the majestic city. It rose direct from the water. Endless stretches
                    of ethereal-looking structure, reaching higher and higher, in masses like
                    mountain ranges, in peaks, in towers and domes. And millions of lights, like
                    fairy lamps, like resplendent jewels, gave the city a glory beyond that of the
                    stars thronging the heavens on a clear summer night. </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0480" n="457"/>
                <p>They looked toward the north; on and on, to the far horizon's edge stretched the
                    broad river and the lovely city that seemed the newborn offspring of the waves;
                    on and on, the myriad lights, in masses, in festoons, in great gleaming globes
                    of fire from towers rising higher than Susan's and Rod's native hills. They
                    looked to the south. There, too, rose city, mile after mile, and then beyond it
                    the expanse of the bay; and everywhere the lights, the beautiful, soft, starlike
                    lights, shedding a radiance as of heaven itself over the whole scene. Majesty
                    and strength and beauty. </p>
                <p>"I love it!" murmured the girl. "Already I love it." </p>
                <p>"I never dreamed it was like this," said Roderick, in an awed tone. </p>
                <p>"The City of the Stars," said she, in the caressing tone in which a lover speaks
                    the name of the beloved. </p>
                <p>They moved closer together and clasped hands and gazed as if they feared the
                    whole thing&mdash;river and magic city and their own selves&mdash;would
                    fade away and vanish forever. Susan clutched Rod in terror as she saw the vision
                    suddenly begin to move, to advance toward her, like apparitions in a dream
                    before they vanish. Then she exclaimed, "Why, we are moving!" The big ferryboat,
                    swift, steady as land, noiseless, had got under way. Upon them from the
                    direction of the distant and hidden sea blew a cool, fresh breeze. Never before
                    had either smelled that perfume, strong and keen and clean, which comes straight
                    from the unbreathed air of the ocean to bathe New York, to put life and hope and
                    health into its people. Rod and Susan turned their faces southward toward this
                    breeze, drank in great draughts of it. They saw a colossal statue, vivid as life
                    in the dusk, in the hand at the end 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0481" n="458"/>
                    of the high-flung arm a torch which sent a
                    blaze of light streaming out over land and water. </p>
                <p>"That must be Liberty," said Roderick. </p>
                <p>Susan slipped her arm through his. She was quivering with excitement and joy.
                    "Rod&mdash;Rod!" she murmured. "It's the isles of freedom. Kiss me." </p>
                <p>And he bent and kissed her, and his cheek felt the tears upon hers. He reached
                    for her hand, with an instinct to strengthen her. But when he had it within his
                    its firm and vital grasp sent a thrill of strength through him. </p>
                <p>A few minutes, and they paused at the exit from the ferry house. They almost
                    shrank back, so dazed and helpless did they feel before the staggering billows
                    of noise that swept savagely down upon them&mdash;roar and crash, shriek and
                    snort; the air was shuddering with it, the ground quaking. The beauty had
                    vanished&mdash;the beauty that was not the city but a glamour to lure them
                    into the city's grasp; now that city stood revealed as a monster about to seize
                    and devour them. </p>
                <p>"God!" He shouted in her ear. "Isn't this _frightful!_" </p>
                <p>She was recovering more quickly than he. The faces she saw reassured her. They
                    were human faces; and while they were eager and restless, as if the souls behind
                    them sought that which never could be found, they were sane and kind faces, too.
                    Where others of her own race lived, and lived without fear, she, too, could hope
                    to survive. And already she, who had loved this mighty offspring of the sea and
                    the sky at first glance, saw and felt another magic&mdash;the magic of the
                    peopled solitude. In this vast, this endless solitude she and he would be free.
                    They could do as they pleased, live as they pleased, without thought of the
                    opinion of others. 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0482" n="459"/>
                    Here she could forget the bestial horrors of marriage; here
                    she would fear no scornful pointing at her birthbrand of shame. She and Rod
                    could be poor without shame; they could make their fight in the grateful
                    darkness of obscurity. </p>
                <p>"Scared?" he asked. </p>
                <p>"Not a bit," was her prompt answer. "I love it more than ever." </p>
                <p>"Well, it frightens me a little. I feel helpless&mdash;lost in the noise and
                    the crowd. How can I do anything here!" </p>
                <p>"Others have. Others do." </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;yes! That's so. We must take hold!" And he selected a cabman from
                    the shouting swarm. "We want to go, with two trunks, to the Hotel St. Denis,"
                    said he. </p>
                <p>"All right, sir! Gimme the checks, please." </p>
                <p>Spenser was about to hand them over when Susan said in an undertone, "You haven't
                    asked the price." </p>
                <p>Spenser hastened to repair this important omission. "Ten dollars," replied the
                    cabman as if ten dollars were some such trifle as ten cents. </p>
                <p>Spenser laughed at the first experience of the famous New York habit of talking
                    in a faint careless way of large sums of money&mdash;other people's money.
                    "You did save us a swat," he said to Susan, and beckoned another man. The upshot
                    of a long and arduous discussion, noisy and profane, was that they got the
                    carriage for six dollars&mdash;a price which the policeman who had been
                    drawn into the discussion vouched for as reasonable. Spenser knew it was too
                    high, knew the policeman would get a dollar or so of the profit, but he was
                    weary of the wrangle; and he would not listen to 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0483" n="460"/>
                    Susan's suggestion that they
                    have the trunks sent by the express company and themselves go in a street car
                    for ten cents. At the hotel they got a large comfortable room and a bath for
                    four dollars a day. Spenser insisted it was cheap; Susan showed her
                    alarm&mdash;less than an hour in New York and ten dollars gone, not to speak
                    of she did not know how much change. For Roderick had been scattering tips with
                    what is for some mysterious reason called "a princely hand," though princes know
                    too well the value of money and have too many extravagant tastes ever to go far
                    in sheer throwing away. </p>
                <p>They had dinner in the restaurant of the hotel and set out to explore the land
                    they purposed to subdue and to possess. They walked up Broadway to Fourteenth,
                    missed their way in the dazzle and glare of south Union Square, discovered the
                    wandering highway again after some searching. After the long, rather quiet
                    stretch between Union Square and Thirty-fourth Street they found themselves at
                    the very heart of the city's night life. They gazed in wonder upon the elevated
                    road with its trains thundering by high above them. They crossed Greeley Square
                    and stood entranced before the spectacle&mdash;a street bright as day with
                    electric signs of every color, shape and size; sidewalks jammed with people,
                    most of them dressed with as much pretense to fashion as the few best in
                    Cincinnati; one theater after another, and at Forty-second Street theaters in
                    every direction. Surely&mdash;surely&mdash;there would be small
                    difficulty in placing his play when there were so many theaters, all eager for
                    plays. </p>
                <p>They debated going to the theater, decided against it, as they were tired from
                    the journey and the excitement of crowding new sensations. "I've never been to a
                    
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0484" n="461"/>
                    real theater in my life," said Susan. "I want to be fresh the first time I go." </p>
                <p>"Yes," cried Rod. "That's right. Tomorrow night. That _will_ be an experience!"
                    And they read the illuminated signs, inspected the show windows, and slowly
                    strolled back toward the hotel. As they were recrossing Union Square, Spenser
                    said, "Have you noticed how many street girls there are? We must have passed a
                    thousand. Isn't it frightful?" </p>
                <p>"Yes," said Susan. </p>
                <p>Rod made a gesture of disgust, and said with feeling, "How low a woman must have
                    sunk before she could take to that life!" </p>
                <p>"Yes," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"So low that there couldn't possibly be left any shred of feeling or decency
                    anywhere in her." Susan did not reply. </p>
                <p>"It's not a question of morals, but of sensibility," pursued he. "Some day I'm
                    going to write a play or a story about it. A woman with anything to her, who had
                    to choose between that life and death, wouldn't hesitate an instant. She
                    couldn't. A streetwalker!" And again he made that gesture of disgust. </p>
                <p>"Before you write," said Susan, in a queer, quiet voice, "you'll find out all
                    about it. Maybe some of these girls&mdash;most of them&mdash;all of
                    them&mdash;are still human beings. It's not fair to judge people unless you
                    know. And it's so easy to say that someone else ought to die rather than do this
                    or that." </p>
                <p>"You can't imagine yourself doing such a thing," urged he. </p>
                <p>Susan hesitated, then&mdash;"Yes," she said. </p>
                <p>Her tone irritated him. "Oh, nonsense! You don't know what you're talking about." </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0485" n="462"/>
                <p>"Yes," said Susan. </p>
                <p>"Susie!" he exclaimed, looking reprovingly at her. </p>
                <p>She met his eyes without flinching. "Yes," she said. "I have." </p>
                <p>He stopped short and his expression set her bosom to heaving. But her gaze was
                    steady upon his. "Why did you tell me!" he cried. "Oh, it isn't so&mdash;it
                    can't be. You don't mean exactly that." </p>
                <p>"Yes, I do," said she. </p>
                <p>"Don't tell me! I don't want to know." And he strode on, she keeping beside him. </p>
                <p>"I can't let you believe me different from what I am," replied she. "Not you. I
                    supposed you guessed." </p>
                <p>"Now I'll always think of it&mdash;whenever I look at you. . . . I simply
                    can't believe it. . . . You spoke of it as if you weren't ashamed." </p>
                <p>"I'm not ashamed," she said. "Not before you. There isn't anything I've done that
                    I wouldn't be willing to have you know. I'd have told you, except that I didn't
                    want to recall it. You know that nobody can live without getting dirty. The
                    thing is to want to be clean&mdash;and to try to get clean
                    afterward&mdash;isn't it?" </p>
                <p>"Yes," he admitted, as if he had not been hearing. "I wish you hadn't told me.
                    I'll always see it and feel it when I look at you." </p>
                <p>"I want you to," said she. "I couldn't love you as I do if I hadn't gone through
                    a great deal." </p>
                <p>"But it must have left its stains upon you," said he. Again he stopped short in
                    the street, faced her at the curb, with the crowd hurrying by and jostling them.
                    "Tell me about it!" he commanded. </p>
                <p>She shook her head. "I couldn't." To have told would have been like tearing open
                    closed and healed 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0486" n="463"/>
                    wounds. Also it would have seemed whining&mdash;and she
                    had utter contempt for whining. "I'll answer any question, but I can't just go
                    on and tell." </p>
                <p>"You deliberately went and did&mdash;that?" </p>
                <p>"Yes." </p>
                <p>"Haven't you any excuse, any defense?" </p>
                <p>She might have told him about Burlingham dying and the need of money to save him.
                    She might have told him about Etta&mdash;her health going&mdash;her mind
                    made up to take to the streets, with no one to look after her. She might have
                    made it all a moving and a true tale&mdash;of self-sacrifice for the two
                    people who had done most for her. But it was not in her simple honest nature to
                    try to shift blame. So all she said was: </p>
                <p>"No, Rod." </p>
                <p>"And you didn't want to kill yourself first?" </p>
                <p>"No. I wanted to live. I was dirty&mdash;and I wanted to be clean. I was
                    hungry&mdash;and I wanted food. I was cold&mdash;that was the worst. I
                    was cold, and I wanted to get warm. And&mdash;I had been
                    married&mdash;but I couldn't tell even you about
                    that&mdash;except&mdash;after a woman's been through what I went through
                    then, nothing in life has any real terror or horror for her." </p>
                <p>He looked at her long. "I don't understand," he finally said. "Come on. Let's go
                    back to the hotel." </p>
                <p>She walked beside him, making no attempt to break his gloomy silence. They went
                    up to their room and she sat on the lounge by the window. He lit a cigarette and
                    half sat, half lay, upon the bed. After a long time he said with a bitter laugh,
                    "And I was so sure you were a good woman!" </p>
                <p>"I don't feel bad," she ventured timidly. "Am I?" </p>
                <p>"Do you mean to tell me," he cried, sitting up, "that you don't think anything of
                    those things?" </p>
               
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0487" n="464"/>
                <p>"Life can be so hard and cruel, can make one do so many&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"But don't you realize that what you've done is the very worst thing a woman can
                    do?" </p>
                <p>"No," said she. "I don't. . . . I'm sorry you didn't understand. I thought you
                    did&mdash;not the details, but in a general sort of way. I didn't mean to
                    deceive you. That would have seemed to me much worse than anything I did." </p>
                <p>"I might have known! I might have known!" he cried&mdash;rather theatrically,
                    though sincerely withal&mdash;for Mr. Spenser was a diligent worker with the
                    tools of the play-making trade. "I learned who you were as soon as I got home
                    the night I left you in Carrolton. They had been telephoning about you to the
                    village. So I knew about you." </p>
                <p>"About my mother?" asked she. "Is that what you mean?" </p>
                <p>"Oh, you need not look so ashamed," said he, graciously, pityingly. </p>
                <p>"I am not ashamed," said she. But she did not tell him that her look came from an
                    awful fear that he was about to make her ashamed of him. </p>
                <p>"No, I suppose you aren't," he went on, incensed by this further evidence of her
                    lack of a good woman's instincts. "I really ought not to blame you. You were
                    born wrong&mdash;born with the moral sense left out." </p>
                <p>"Yes, I suppose so," said she, wearily. </p>
                <p>"If only you had lied to me&mdash;told me the one lie!" cried he. "Then you
                    wouldn't have destroyed my illusion. You wouldn't have killed my love." </p>
                <p>She grew deathly white; that was all. </p>
                <p>"I don't mean that I don't love you still," he hurried on. "But not in the same
                    way. That's killed forever." </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0488" n="465"/>
                <p>"Are there different ways of loving?" she asked. "How can I give you the love of
                    respect and trust&mdash;now?" </p>
                <p>"Don't you trust me&mdash;any more?" </p>
                <p>"I couldn't. I simply couldn't. It was hard enough before on account of your
                    birth. But now&mdash;Trust a woman who had been a&mdash; a&mdash;I
                    can't speak the word. Trust you? You don't understand a man." </p>
                <p>"No, I don't." She looked round drearily. Everything in ruins. Alone again.
                    Outcast. Nowhere to go but the streets&mdash;the life that seemed the only
                    one for such as she. "I don't understand people at all. . . . Do you want me to
                    go?" </p>
                <p>She had risen as she asked this. He was beside her instantly. "Go!" he cried.
                    "Why I couldn't get along without you." </p>
                <p>"Then you love me as I love you," Said she, putting her arms round him. "And
                    that's all I want. I don't want what you call respect. I couldn't ever have
                    hoped to get that, being born as I was&mdash;could I? Anyhow, it doesn't
                    seem to me to amount to much. I can't help it, Rod&mdash;that's the way I
                    feel. So just love me&mdash;do with me whatever you will, so long as it
                    makes you happy. And I don't need to be trusted. I couldn't think of anybody but
                    you." </p>
                <p>He felt sure of her again, reascended to the peak of the moral mountain. "You
                    understand, we can never get married. We can never have any children." </p>
                <p>"I don't mind. I didn't expect that. We can _love_&mdash;can't we?" </p>
                <p>He took her face between his hands. "What an exquisite face it is," he said,
                    "soft and smooth! And what clear, honest eyes! Where is _it?_ Where _is_ it? It
                    _must_ be there!" </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0489" n="466"/>
                <p>"What, Rod?" </p>
                <p>"The&mdash;the dirt." </p>
                <p>She did not wince, but there came into her young face a deeper
                    pathos&mdash;and a wan, deprecating, pleading smile. She said: </p>
                <p>"Maybe love has washed it away&mdash;if it was there. It never seemed to
                    touch me&mdash;any more than the dirt when I had to clean up my room." </p>
                <p>"You mustn't talk that way. Why you are perfectly calm! You don't cry or feel
                    repentant. You don't seem to care." </p>
                <p>"It's so&mdash;so past&mdash;and dead. I feel as if it were another
                    person. And it was, Rod!" </p>
                <p>He shook his head, frowning. "Let's not talk about it," he said harshly. "If only
                    I could stop thinking about it!" </p>
                <p>She effaced herself as far as she could, living in the same room with him. She
                    avoided the least show of the tenderness she felt, of the longing to have her
                    wounds soothed. She lay awake the whole night, suffering, now and then timidly
                    and softly caressing him when she was sure that he slept. In the morning she
                    pretended to be asleep, let him call her twice before she showed that she was
                    awake. A furtive glance at him confirmed the impression his voice had given.
                    Behind her pale, unrevealing face there was the agonized throb of an aching
                    heart, but she had the confidence of her honest, utter love; he would surely
                    soften, would surely forgive. As for herself&mdash;she had, through loving
                    and feeling that she was loved, almost lost the sense of the unreality of past
                    and present that made her feel quite detached and apart from the life she was
                    leading, from the events in which she was taking part, from the persons most
                    intimately associated with her. Now that 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0490" n="467"/>
                    sense of isolation, of the mere
                    spectator or the traveler gazing from the windows of the hurrying
                    train&mdash;that sense returned. But she fought against the feeling it gave
                    her. </p>
                <p>That evening they went to the theater&mdash;to see Modjeska in "Magda." </p>
                <p>Susan had never been in a real theater. The only approach to a playhouse in
                    Sutherland was Masonic Hall. It had a sort of stage at one end where from time
                    to time wandering players gave poor performances of poor plays or a minstrel
                    show or a low vaudeville. But none of the best people of Sutherland
                    went&mdash;at least, none of the women. The notion was strong in Sutherland
                    that the theater was of the Devil&mdash;not so strong as in the days before
                    they began to tolerate amateur theatricals, but still vigorous enough to give
                    Susan now, as she sat in the big, brilliant auditorium, a pleasing sense that
                    she, an outcast, was at last comfortably at home. Usually the first sight of
                    anything one has dreamed about is pitifully disappointing. Neither nature nor
                    life can build so splendidly as a vivid fancy. But Susan, in some sort prepared
                    for the shortcomings of the stage, was not disappointed. From rise to fall of
                    curtain she was so fascinated, so absolutely absorbed, that she quite forgot her
                    surroundings, even Rod. And between the acts she could not talk for thinking.
                    Rod, deceived by her silence, was chagrined. He had been looking forward to a
                    great happiness for himself in seeing her happy, and much profit from the study
                    of the viewpoint of an absolutely fresh mind. It wasn't until they were leaving
                    the theater that he got an inkling of the true state of affairs with her. </p>
                <p>"Let's go to supper," said he. </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0491" n="468"/>
                <p>"If you don't mind," replied she, "I'd rather go home. I'm very tired." </p>
                <p>"You were sound asleep this morning. So you must have slept well," said he
                    sarcastically. </p>
                <p>"It's the play," said she. </p>
                <p>"_Why_ didn't you like it?" he asked, irritated. </p>
                <p>She looked at him in wonder. "Like what? The play?" She drew a long breath. "I
                    feel as if it had almost killed me." </p>
                <p>He understood when they were in their room and she could hardly undress before
                    falling into a sleep so relaxed, so profound, that it made him a little uneasy.
                    It seemed to him the exhaustion of a child worn out with the excitement of a
                    spectacle. And her failure to go into ecstasies the next day led him further
                    into the same error. "Modjeska is very good as _Magda_," said he, carelessly, as
                    one talking without expecting to be understood. "But they say there's an Italian
                    woman&mdash;Duse&mdash;who is the real thing." </p>
                <p>Modjeska&mdash;Duse&mdash;Susan seemed indeed not to understand. "I hated
                    her father," she said. "He didn't deserve to have such a wonderful daughter." </p>
                <p>Spenser had begun to laugh with her first sentence. At the second he frowned,
                    said bitterly: "I might have known! You get it all wrong. I suppose you
                    sympathize with _Magda_?" </p>
                <p>"I worshiped, her " said Susan, her voice low and tremulous with the intensity of
                    her feeling. </p>
                <p>Roderick laughed bitterly. "Naturally," he said. "You can't understand." </p>
                <p>An obvious case, thought he. She was indeed one of those instances of absolute
                    lack of moral sense. Just as some people have the misfortune to be born without
                    arms or without legs, so others are doomed to live bereft 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0492" n="469"/>
                    of a moral sense. A
                    sweet disposition, a beautiful body, but no soul; not a stained soul, but no
                    soul at all. And his whole mental attitude toward her changed; or, rather, it
                    was changed by the iron compulsion of his prejudice. The only change in his
                    physical attitude&mdash;that is, in his treatment of her&mdash;was in
                    the direction of bolder passion. of complete casting aside of all the restraint
                    a conventional respecter of conventional womanhood feels toward a woman whom he
                    respects. So, naturally, Susan, eager to love and to be loved, and easily
                    confusing the not easily distinguished spiritual and physical, was reassured.
                    Once in a while a look or a phrase from him gave her vague uneasiness; but on
                    the whole she felt that, in addition to clear conscience from
                    straightforwardness, she had a further reason for being glad Chance had forced
                    upon her the alternative of telling him or lying. She did not inquire into the
                    realities beneath the surface of their life&mdash;neither into what he
                    thought of her, nor into what she thought of him&mdash;thought in the bottom
                    of her heart. She continued to fight against, to ignore, her feeling of
                    aloneness, her feeling of impending departure. </p>
                <p>She was aided in this by her anxiety about their finances. In his efforts to
                    place his play he was spending what were for them large sums of
                    money&mdash;treating this man and that to dinners, to
                    suppers&mdash;inviting men to lunch with him at expensive Broadway
                    restaurants. She assumed that all this was necessary; he said so, and he must
                    know. He was equally open-handed when they were alone, insisting on ordering the
                    more expensive dishes, on having suppers they really did not need and drink
                    which she knew she would be better off without&mdash;and, she suspected, he
                    also. It simply was not in him, she saw, to be careful about money. She 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0493" n="470"/>
                    liked
                    it, as a trait, for to her as to all the young and the unthinking carelessness
                    about money seems a sure, perhaps the surest, sign of generosity&mdash;when
                    in fact the two qualities are in no way related. Character is not a collection
                    of ignorant impulses but a solidly woven fabric of deliberate purposes.
                    Carelessness about anything most often indicates a tendency to carelessness
                    about everything. She admired his openhanded way of scattering; she wouldn't
                    have admired it in herself, would have thought it dishonest and selfish. But Rod
                    was different. _He_ had the "artistic temperament," while she was a commonplace
                    nobody, who ought to be&mdash;and was&mdash;grateful to him for allowing
                    her to stay on and for making such use of her as he saw fit. Still, even as she
                    admired, she saw danger, grave danger, a disturbingly short distance ahead. He
                    described to her the difficulties he was having in getting to managers, in
                    having his play read, and the absurdity of the reasons given for turning it
                    down. He made light of all these; the next manager would see, would give him a
                    big advance, would put the play on&mdash;and then, Easy Street! </p>
                <p>But experience had already killed what little optimism there was in her
                    temperament&mdash;and there had not been much, because George Warham was a
                    successful man in his line, and successful men do not create or permit
                    optimistic atmosphere even in their houses. Nor had she forgotten Burlingham's
                    lectures on the subject with illustrations from his own spoiled career; she
                    understood it all now&mdash;and everything else he had given her to store up
                    in her memory that retained everything. With that philippic against optimism in
                    mind, she felt what Spenser was rushing toward. She made such inquiries about
                    work for herself as her inexperience 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0494" n="471"/>
                    and limited opportunities permitted. She
                    asked, she begged him, to let her try to get a place. He angrily ordered her to
                    put any such notion out of her head. After a time she nerved herself again to
                    speak. Then he frankly showed her why he was refusing. </p>
                <p>"No," said he peremptorily, "I couldn't trust you in those temptations. You must
                    stay where I can guard you." </p>
                <p>A woman who had deliberately taken to the streets&mdash;why, she thought
                    nothing of virtue; she would be having lovers with the utmost indifference; and
                    while she was not a liar yet&mdash;"at least, I think not"&mdash;how
                    long would that last? With virtue gone, virtue the foundation of woman's
                    character&mdash;the rest could no more stand than a house set on sand. </p>
                <p>"As long as you want me to love you, you've got to stay with me," he declared.
                    "If you persist, I'll know you're simply looking for a chance to go back to your
                    old ways." </p>
                <p>And though she continued to think and cautiously to inquire about work she said
                    no more to him. She spent not a penny, discouraged him from throwing money
                    away&mdash;as much as she could without irritating him&mdash;and waited
                    for the cataclysm. Waited not in gloom and tears but as normal healthy youth
                    awaits any adversity not definitely scheduled for an hour close at hand. It
                    would be far indeed from the truth to picture Susan as ever for long a
                    melancholy figure to the eye or even wholly melancholy within. Her intelligence
                    and her too sympathetic heart were together a strong force for sadness in her
                    life, as they cannot but be in any life. In this world, to understand and to
                    sympathize is to be saddened. But there was in her 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0495" n="472"/>
                    a force stronger than either
                    or both. She had superb health. It made her beautiful, strong body happy; and
                    that physical happiness brought her up quickly out of any depths&mdash;made
                    her gay in spite of herself, caused her to enjoy even when she felt that it was
                    "almost like hard-heartedness to be happy." She loved the sun and in this city
                    where the sun shone almost all the days, sparkling gloriously upon the tiny salt
                    particles filling the air and making it delicious to breathe and upon the
                    skin&mdash;in this City of the Sun as she called it, she was gay even when
                    she was heavy-hearted. </p>
                <p>Thus, she was no repellent, aggravating companion to Rod as she awaited the
                    cataclysm. </p>
                <p> It came in the third week. He spent the entire day away from her, toward
                    midnight he returned, flushed with liquor. She had gone to bed. "Get up and
                    dress," said he with an irritability toward her which she had no difficulty in
                    seeing was really directed at himself. "I'm hungry&mdash;and thirsty. We're
                    going out for some supper." </p>
                <p>"Come kiss me first," said she, stretching out her arms. Several times this
                    device had shifted his purpose from spending money on the needless and expensive
                    suppers. </p>
                <p>He laughed. "Not a kiss. We're going to have one final blow-out. I start to work
                    tomorrow. I've taken a place on the _Herald_&mdash;on space, guaranty of
                    twenty-five a week, good chance to average fifty or sixty." </p>
                <p>He said this hurriedly, carelessly, gayly&mdash;guiltily. She showed then and
                    there what a surpassing wise young woman she was, for she did not exclaim or
                    remind him of his high resolve to do or die as a playwright. "I'll be ready in a
                    minute," was all she said. </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0496" n="473"/>
                <p>She dressed swiftly, he lounging on the sofa and watching her. He loved to watch
                    her dress, she did it so gracefully, and the motions brought out latent charms
                    of her supple figure. "You're not so sure-fingered tonight as usual," said he.
                    "I never saw you make so many blunders&mdash;and you've got one stocking on
                    wrong side out." </p>
                <p>She smiled into the glass at him. "The skirt'll cover that. I guess I was
                    sleepy." </p>
                <p>"Never saw your eyes more wide-awake. What're you thinking about?" </p>
                <p>"About supper," declared she. "I'm hungry. I didn't feel like eating alone." </p>
                <p>"I can't be here always," said he crossly&mdash;and she knew he was
                    suspecting what she really must be thinking. </p>
                <p>"I wasn't complaining," replied she sweetly. "You know I understand about
                    business." </p>
                <p>"Yes, I know," said he, with his air of generosity that always made her feel
                    grateful. "I always feel perfectly free about you." </p>
                <p>"I should say!" laughed she. "You know I don't care what happens so long as you
                    succeed." Since their talk in Broadway that first evening in New York she had
                    instinctively never said "we." </p>
                <p>When they were at the table at Rector's and he had taken a few more drinks, he
                    became voluble and plausible on the subject of the trifling importance of his
                    setback as a playwright. It was the worst possible time of year; the managers
                    were stocked up; his play would have to be rewritten to suit some particular
                    star; a place on a newspaper, especially such an influential paper as the
                    _Herald_, would be of use to him in interesting managers. She listened and
                    looked convinced, 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0497" n="474"/>
                    and strove to convince herself that she believed. But there
                    was no gray in her eyes, only the deepest hue of violets. </p>
                <p>Next day they took a suite of two rooms and a bath in a pretentious old house in
                    West Forty-fourth Street near Long Acre Square. She insisted that she preferred
                    another much sunnier and quieter suite with no bath but only a stationary
                    washstand; it was to be had for ten dollars a week. But he laughed at her as too
                    economical in her ideas, and decided for the eighteen-dollar rooms. Also he went
                    with her to buy clothes, made her spend nearly a hundred dollars where she would
                    have spent less than twenty-five. "I prefer to make most of my things," declared
                    she. "And I've all the time in the world." He would not have it. In her leisure
                    time she must read and amuse herself and keep herself up to the mark, especially
                    physically. "I'm proud of your looks," said he. "They belong to me, don't they?
                    Well, take care of my property, Miss." </p>
                <p>She looked at him vaguely&mdash;a look of distance, of parting, of pain. Then
                    she flung herself into his arms with a hysterical cry&mdash;and shut her
                    eyes tight against the beckoning figure calling her away. "No! No!" she
                    murmured. "I belong here&mdash;_here!_" </p>
                <p>"What are you saying?" he asked. </p>
                <p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing," she replied. </p>

                <head> XXV</head>
                <p> AT the hotel they had been Mr. and Mrs. Spenser. When they moved, he tried to
                    devise some way round this; but it was necessary that they have his address at
                    the office, and Mrs. Pershall with the glistening old-fashioned false teeth who
                    kept the furnished-room house was not one in whose withered bosom it would be
                    wise to raise a suspicion as to respectability. Only in a strenuously
                    respectable house would he live; in the other sort, what might not untrustworthy
                    Susan be up to? So Mr. and Mrs. Spenser they remained, and the truth was
                    suspected by only a few of their acquaintances, was known by two or three of his
                    intimates whom he told in those bursts of confidence to which voluble, careless
                    men are given&mdash;and for which they in resolute self-excuse unjustly
                    blame strong drink. </p>
                <p>One of his favorite remarks to her&mdash;sometimes made laughingly, again
                    ironically, again angrily, again insultingly, was in this strain: </p>
                <p>"Your face is demure enough. But you look too damned attractive about those
                    beautiful feet of yours to be respectable at heart&mdash;and trustable." </p>
                <p>That matter of her untrustworthiness had become a fixed idea with him. The more
                    he concentrated upon her physical loveliness, the more he revolved the dangers,
                    the possibilities of unfaithfulness; for a physical infatuation is always
                    jealous. His work on the _Herald_ made close guarding out of the question. The
                    best he could do was to pop in unexpectedly upon her from time to time, to
                    rummage through her belongings, 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0499" n="476"/>
                    to check up her statements as to her goings and
                    comings by questioning the servants and, most important of all, each day to put
                    her through searching and skillfully planned cross-examination. She had to tell
                    him everything she did&mdash;every little thing&mdash;and he calculated
                    the time, to make sure she had not found half an hour or so in which to deceive
                    him. If she had sewed, he must look at the sewing; if she had read, he must know
                    how many pages and must hear a summary of what those pages contained. As she
                    would not and could not deceive him in any matter, however small, she was
                    compelled to give over a plan quietly to look for work and to fit herself for
                    some occupation that would pay a living wage&mdash;if there were such for a
                    beginning woman worker. </p>
                <p>At first he was covert in this detective work, being ashamed of his own
                    suspicions. But as he drank, as he associated again with the same sort of people
                    who had wasted his time in Cincinnati, he rapidly became franker and more
                    inquisitorial. And she dreaded to see the look she knew would come into his
                    eyes, the cruel tightening of his mouth, if in her confusion and eagerness she
                    should happen not instantly to satisfy the doubt behind each question. He
                    tormented her; he tormented himself. She suffered from humiliation; but she
                    suffered more because she saw how his suspicions were torturing him. And in her
                    humility and helplessness and inexperience, she felt no sense of right to
                    resist, no impulse to resist. </p>
                <p>And she forced herself to look on his spasms of jealousy as the occasional storms
                    which occur even in the best climates. She reminded herself that she was secure
                    of his love, secure in his love; and in her sad mood she reproached herself for
                    not being content
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0500" n="477"/>
                    when at bottom everything was all right. After what she had
                    been through, to be sad because the man she loved loved her too well! It was
                    absurd, ungrateful. </p>
                <p>He pried into every nook and corner of her being with that ingenious and tireless
                    persistence human beings reserve for searches for what they do not wish to find.
                    At last he contrived to find, or to imagine he had found, something that
                    justified his labors and vindicated his disbelief in her. </p>
                <p>They were walking in Fifth Avenue one afternoon, at the hour when there is the
                    greatest press of equipages whose expensively and showily dressed occupants are
                    industriously engaged in the occupation of imagining they are doing something
                    when in fact they are doing nothing. What a world! What a grotesque confusing of
                    motion and progress! What fantastic delusions that one is busy when one is
                    merely occupied! They were between Forty-sixth Street and Forty-seventh, on the
                    west side, when a small victoria drew up at the curb and a woman descended and
                    crossed the sidewalk before them to look at the display in a milliner's window.
                    Susan gave her the swift, seeing glance which one woman always gives
                    another&mdash;the glance of competitors at each other's offerings. Instead
                    of glancing away, Susan stopped short and gazed. Forgetting Rod, she herself
                    went up to the millinery display that she might have a fuller view of the woman
                    who had fascinated her. </p>
                <p>"What's the matter?" cried Spenser. "Come on. You don't want any of those hats." </p>
                <p>But Susan insisted that she must see, made him linger until the woman returned to
                    her carriage and drove away. She said to Rod: </p>
                <p>"Did you see her?" </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0501" n="478"/>
                <p>"Yes. Rather pretty&mdash;nothing to scream about." </p>
                <p>"But her _style!_" cried Susan. </p>
                <p>"Oh, she was nicely dressed&mdash;in a quiet way. You'll see thousands a lot
                    more exciting after you've been about in this town a while." </p>
                <p>"I've seen scores of beautifully dressed women here&mdash;and in Cincinnati,
                    too," replied Susan. "But that woman&mdash;she was _perfect_. And that's a
                    thing I've never seen before." "I'm glad you have such quiet
                    tastes&mdash;quiet and inexpensive." </p>
                <p>"Inexpensive!" exclaimed Susan. "I don't dare think how much that woman's clothes
                    cost. You only glanced at her, Rod, you didn't _look_. If you had, you'd have
                    seen. Everything she wore was just right." Susan's eyes were brilliant. "Oh, it
                    was wonderful! The colors&mdash;the fit&mdash;the style&mdash;the
                    making&mdash;every big and little thing. She was a work of art, Rod! That's
                    the first woman I've seen in my life that I through and through envied." </p>
                <p>Rod's look was interested now. "You like that sort of thing a lot?" he inquired
                    with affected carelessness. </p>
                <p>"Every woman does," replied she, unsuspicious. "But I care&mdash;well, not
                    for merely fine clothes. But for the&mdash;the kind that show what sort of
                    person is in them." She sighed. "I wonder if I'll ever learn&mdash;and have
                    money enough to carry out. It'll take so much&mdash;so much!" She laughed.
                    "I've got terribly extravagant ideas. But don't be alarmed&mdash;I keep them
                    chained up." </p>
                <p>He was eying her unpleasantly. Suddenly she became confused. He thought it was
                    because she was seeing and understanding his look and was frightened at his
                    having caught her at last. In fact, it was because 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0502" n="479"/>
                    it all at once struck her
                    that what she had innocently and carelessly said sounded like a hint or a
                    reproach to him. He sneered: </p>
                <p>"So you're crazy about finery&mdash;eh?" </p>
                <p>"Oh, Rod!" she cried. "You know I didn't mean it that way. I long for and dream
                    about a whole lot of beautiful things, but nothing else in the world's in the
                    same class with&mdash;with what we've got." </p>
                <p>"You needn't try to excuse yourself," said he in a tone that silenced her. </p>
                <p>She wished she had not seen the woman who had thus put a cloud over their
                    afternoon's happiness. But long after she had forgotten his queerness about what
                    she said, she continued to remember that "perfect" woman&mdash;to see every
                    detail of her exquisite toilet, so rare in a world where expensive-looking
                    finery is regarded as the chief factor in the art of dress. How much she would
                    have to learn before she could hope to dress like that!&mdash;learn not
                    merely about dress but about the whole artistic side of life. For that woman had
                    happened to cross Susan's vision at just the right moment&mdash;in
                    development and in mood&mdash;to reveal to her clearly a world into which
                    she had never penetrated&mdash;a world of which she had vaguely dreamed as
                    she read novels of life in the lands beyond the seas, the life of palaces and
                    pictures and statuary, of opera and theater, of equipages and servants and food
                    and clothing of rare quality. She had rather thought such a life did not exist
                    outside of novels and dreams. What she had seen of New York&mdash;the
                    profuse, the gigantic but also the undiscriminating&mdash;had tended to
                    strengthen the suspicion. But this woman proved her mistaken. </p>
                <p>Our great forward strides are made unconsciously, 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0503" n="480"/>
                    are the results of apparently
                    trivial, often unnoted impulses. Susan, like all our race, had always had vague
                    secret dreams of ambition&mdash;so vague thus far that she never thought of
                    them as impelling purposes in her life. Her first long forward stride toward
                    changing these dreams from the vague to the definite was when Rod, before her on
                    the horse on the way to Brooksburg, talked over his shoulder to her of the stage
                    and made her feel that it was the life for her, the only life open to her where
                    a woman could hope to be judged as human being instead of as mere instrument of
                    sex. Her second long forward movement toward sharply defined ambition dated from
                    the sight of the woman of the milliner's window&mdash;the woman who
                    epitomized to Susan the whole art side of life that always gives its highest
                    expression in some personal achievement&mdash;the perfect toilet, the
                    perfect painting or sculpture, the perfect novel or play. </p>
                <p>But Rod saw in her enthusiasm only evidence of a concealed longing for the money
                    to indulge extravagant whims. With his narrowing interest in
                    women&mdash;narrowed now almost to sex&mdash;his contempt for them as to
                    their minds and their hearts was so far advancing that he hardly took the
                    trouble to veil it with remnants of courtesy. If Susan had clearly
                    understood&mdash;even if she had let herself understand what her increasing
                    knowledge might have enabled her to understand&mdash;she would have hated
                    him in spite of the hold gratitude and habit had given him upon her loyal
                    nature&mdash;and despite the fact that she had, as far as she could see, no
                    alternative to living with him but the tenements or the streets. </p>
                <p>One day in midsummer she chanced to go into the Hotel Astor to buy a magazine. As
                    she had not been 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0504" n="481"/>
                    there before she made a wrong turning and was forced to cross
                    one of the restaurants. In a far corner, half hidden by a group of palms, she
                    saw Rod at a small table with a strikingly pretty woman whose expression and
                    dress and manner most energetically proclaimed the actress. The woman was
                    leaning toward him, was touching his hand and looking into his eyes with that
                    show of enthusiasm which raises doubts of sincerity in an experienced man and
                    sets him to keeping an eye or a hand&mdash;or both&mdash;upon his money.
                    Real emotion, even a professional expert at display of emotion, is rarely so
                    adept at exhibiting itself. </p>
                <p>It may have been jealousy that guided her to this swift judgment upon the
                    character of the emotion correctly and charmingly expressing itself. If so,
                    jealousy was for once a trustworthy guide. She turned swiftly and escaped
                    unseen. The idea of trapping him, of confronting him, never occurred to her. She
                    felt ashamed and self-reproachful that she had seen. Instead of the anger that
                    fires a vain woman, whether she cares about a man or not, there came a profound
                    humiliation. She had in some way fallen short; she had not given him all he
                    needed; it must be that she hadn't it to give, since she had given him all she
                    had. He must not know&mdash;he must not! For if he knew he might dislike
                    her, might leave her&mdash;and she dared not think what life would be
                    without him, her only source of companionship and affection, her only means of
                    support. She was puzzled that her discovery, not of his treachery&mdash;he
                    had so broken her spirit with his suspicions and his insulting questions that
                    she did not regard herself as of the rank and dignity that has the right to
                    exact fidelity&mdash;but of his no longer caring enough to be content with
                    her alone, had not stunned her with amazement. 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0505" n="482"/>
                    She did not realize how
                    completely the instinct that he was estranged from her had prepared her for the
                    thing that always accompanies estrangement. Between the perfect accord, that is,
                    the never realized ideal for a man and a woman living together, and the
                    intolerable discord that means complete repulse there is a vast range of states
                    of feeling imperceptibly shading into each other. Most couples constantly move
                    along this range, now toward the one extreme, now toward the other. As human
                    kings are not given to self-analysis, and usually wander into grotesque error
                    whenever they attempt it, no couple knows precisely where it is upon the range,
                    until something crucial happens to compel them to know. Susan and Rod had begun
                    as all couples begin&mdash;with an imaginary ideal accord based upon their
                    ignorance of each other and their misunderstanding of what qualities they
                    thought they understood in each other. The delusion of accord vanished that
                    first evening in New York. What remained? What came in the place? They knew no
                    more about that than does the next couple. They were simply "living along." A
                    crisis, drawing them close together or flinging them forever apart or forcing
                    them to live together, he frankly as keeper and she frankly as kept, might come
                    any day, any hour. Again it might never come. </p>
                <p>After a few weeks the matter that had been out of her mind accidentally and
                    indirectly came to the surface in a chance remark. She said: </p>
                <p>"Sometimes I half believe a man could be untrue to a woman, even though he loved
                    her." </p>
                <p>She did not appreciate the bearings of her remark until it was spoken. With a
                    sensation of terror lest the dreaded crisis might be about to burst, she felt
                    his 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0506" n="483"/>
                    quick, nervous glance. She breathed freely again when she felt his
                    reassurance and relief as she successfully withstood. </p>
                <p>"Certainly," he said with elaborate carelessness. "Men are a rotten, promiscuous
                    lot. That's why it's necessary for a woman to be good and straight." </p>
                <p>All this time his cross-examination had grown in severity. Evidently he was
                    fearing that she might be having a recurrence of the moral disease which was
                    fatal in womankind, though only mild indiscretion in a man, if not positively a
                    virtue, an evidence of possessing a normal masculine nature. Her mind began
                    curiously&mdash;sadly&mdash;to revolve the occasional
                    presents&mdash;of money, of books, of things to wear&mdash;which he
                    gave, always quite unexpectedly. At first unconsciously, but soon consciously,
                    she began to associate these gifts, given always in an embarrassed, shamefaced
                    way, with certain small but significant indications of his having strayed. And
                    it was not long before she understood; she was receiving his expiations for his
                    indiscretions. Like an honest man and a loyal&mdash;masculinely
                    loyal&mdash;lover he was squaring accounts. She never read the books she
                    owed to these twinges; it was thus that she got her aversion to
                    Thackeray&mdash;one of his "expiations" was a set of Thackeray. The things
                    to wear she contrived never to use. The conscience money she either spent upon
                    him or put back into his pocket a little at a time, sure that he, the most
                    careless of men about money, would never detect her. </p>
                <p>His work forced him to keep irregular hours; thus she could pretend to herself
                    that his absences were certainly because of office duty. Still, whenever he was
                    gone overnight, she became unhappy&mdash;not the crying kind of unhappiness;
                    to that she was little given&mdash;but 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0507" n="484"/>
                    the kind that lies awake and aches
                    and with morbid vivid fancy paints the scenes suspicion suggests, and stares at
                    them not in anger but in despair. She was always urging herself to content
                    herself with what she was getting. She recalled and lived again the things she
                    had forgotten while Roderick was wholly hers&mdash;the penalties of the
                    birth brand of shame&mdash;her wedding night&mdash;the miseries of the
                    last period of her wanderings with Burlingham&mdash;her tenement
                    days&mdash;the dirt, the nakedness, the brutal degradation, the vermin, the
                    savage cold. And the instant he returned, no matter how low-spirited she had
                    been, she was at once gay, often deliriously gay&mdash;until soon his
                    awakened suspicion as to what she had been up to in his absence quieted her.
                    There was little forcing or pretense in this gayety; it bubbled and sparkled
                    from the strong swift current of her healthy passionate young life which,
                    suspended in the icy clutch of fear when he was away from her, flowed as freely
                    as the brooks in spring as soon as she realized that she still had him. </p>
                <p>Did she really love him? She believed she did. Was she right? Love is of many
                    degrees&mdash;and kinds. And strange and confused beyond untangling is the
                    mixture of motives and ideas in the mind of any human being as to any other
                    being with whom his or her relations are many sided. </p>
                <p>Anyone who had not been roughly seized by destiny and forced to fight desperately
                    weaponless might have found it difficult to understand how this intelligent,
                    high-spirited girl could be so reasonable&mdash;coarsely practical, many
                    people would have said. A brave soul&mdash;truly brave with the unconscious
                    courage that lives heroically without any taint of heroics&mdash;such a 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0508" n="485"/>
                    soul
                    learns to accept the facts of life, to make the best of things, to be grateful
                    for whatever sunshine may be and not to shriek and gesticulate at storm.
                    Suffering had given this sapling of a girl the strong fiber that enables a tree
                    to push majestically up toward the open sky. Because she did not cry out was no
                    sign that she was not hurt; and because she did not wither and die of her wounds
                    was only proof of her strength of soul. The weak wail and the weak succumb; the
                    strong persist&mdash;and a world of wailers and weaklings calls them hard,
                    insensible, coarse. </p>
                <p>Spenser was fond of exhibiting to his men friends&mdash;to some of
                    them&mdash;this treasure to which he always returned the more enamoured for
                    his vagary and its opportunity of comparison. Women he would not permit. In
                    general, he held that all women, the respectable no less than the other kind,
                    put mischief in each other's heads and egged each other on to carry out the
                    mischief already there in embryo. In particular, he would have felt that he was
                    committing a gross breach of the proprieties, not to say the decencies, had he
                    introduced a woman of Susan's origin, history and present status to the wives
                    and sisters of his friends; and, for reasons which it was not necessary even to
                    pretend to conceal from her, he forbade her having anything to do with the kinds
                    of woman who would not have minded, had they known all about her. Thus, her only
                    acquaintances, her only associates, were certain carefully selected men. He
                    asked to dinner or to the theater or to supper at Jack's or Rector's only such
                    men as he could trust. And trustworthy meant physically unattractive. Having
                    small and dwindling belief in the mentality of women, and no belief whatever in
                    mentality as a force in the relations of the sexes, he was satisfied 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0509" n="486"/>
                    to have
                    about her any man, however clever, provided he was absolutely devoid of physical
                    charm. </p>
                <p>The friend who came oftenest was Drumley, an editorial writer who had been his
                    chum at college and had got him the place on the _Herald_. Drumley he would have
                    trusted alone with her on a desert island; for several reasons, all of his
                    personal convenience, it pleased him that Susan liked Drumley and was glad of
                    his company, no matter how often he came or how long he stayed. Drumley was an
                    emaciated Kentucky giant with grotesquely sloping shoulders which not all the
                    ingenious padding of his tailor could appreciably mitigate. His spare legs were
                    bowed in the calves. His skin looked rough and tough, like sandpaper and emery
                    board. The thought of touching his face gave one the same sensation as a too
                    deeply cut nail. His neck was thin and long, and he wore a low
                    collar&mdash;through that interesting passion of the vain for seeing a
                    defect in themselves as a charm and calling attention to it. The lower part of
                    his sallow face suggested weakness&mdash;the weakness so often seen in the
                    faces of professional men, and explaining why they chose passive instead of
                    active careers. His forehead was really fine, but the development of the rest of
                    the cranium above the protuberant little ears was not altogether satisfying to a
                    claim of mental powers. </p>
                <p>Drumley was a good sort&mdash;not so much through positive virtue as through
                    the timidity which too often accounts for goodness, that is, for the meek
                    conformity which passes as goodness. He was an insatiable reader, had incredible
                    stores of knowledge; and as he had a large vocabulary and a ready speech he
                    could dole out of those reservoirs an agreeable treacle of commonplace
                    philosophy or comment&mdash;thus he had an ideal 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0510" n="487"/>
                    equipment for editorial
                    writing. He was absolutely without physical magnetism. The most he could ever
                    expect from any woman was respect; and that woman would have had to be foolish
                    enough not to realize that there is as abysmal a difference between knowledge
                    and mentality as there is between reputation and character. Susan liked him
                    because he knew so much. She had developed still further her innate passion for
                    educating herself. She now wanted to know all about everything. He told her what
                    to read, set her in the way to discovering and acquiring the art of
                    reading&mdash;an art he was himself capable of acquiring only in its
                    rudiments&mdash;an art the existence of which is entirely unsuspected by
                    most persons who regard themselves and are regarded as readers. He knew the
                    histories and biographies that are most amusing and least shallow and
                    mendacious. He instructed her in the great playwrights and novelists and poets,
                    and gave&mdash;as his own&mdash;the reasons for their greatness assigned
                    by the world's foremost critical writers. He showed her what scientific books to
                    read&mdash;those that do not bore and do not hide the simple fascinating
                    facts about the universe under pretentious, college-professor phraseology. </p>
                <p>He was a pedant, but his pedantry was disguised, therefore mitigated by his
                    having associated with men of the world instead of with the pale and pompous
                    capons of the student's closet. His favorite topic was beauty and
                    ugliness&mdash;and his abhorrence for anyone who was not good to look at. As
                    he talked this subject, his hearers were nervous and embarrassed. He was a
                    drastic cure for physical vanity. If this man could so far deceive himself that
                    he thought himself handsome, who in all the world could be sure he or she was
                    
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0511" n="488"/>
                    not the victim of the same incredible delusion? It was this hallucination of
                    physical beauty that caused Rod to regard him as the safest of the safe. For it
                    made him pitiful and ridiculous. </p>
                <p>At first he came only with Spenser. Afterward, Spenser used to send him to dine
                    with Susan and to spend the evenings with her when he himself had to
                    be&mdash;or wished to be elsewhere. When she was with Drumley he knew she
                    was not "up to any of her old tricks." Drumley fell in love with her; but, as in
                    his experience the female sex was coldly chaste, he never developed even the
                    slight hope necessary to start in a man's mind the idea of treachery to his
                    friend about a woman. Whenever Drumley heard that a woman other than the
                    brazenly out and out disreputables was "loose" or was inclined that way, he
                    indignantly denied it as a libel upon the empedestaled sex. If proofs beyond
                    dispute were furnished, he raved against the man with all the venom of the
                    unsuccessful hating the successful for their success. He had been sought of
                    women, of course, for he had a comfortable and secure position and money put by.
                    But the serious women who had set snares for him for the sake of a home had not
                    attracted him; as for the better looking and livelier women who had come
                    a-courting with alimony in view, they had unwisely chosen the method of approach
                    that caused him to set them down as nothing but professional loose characters.
                    Thus his high ideal of feminine beauty and his lofty notion of his own deserts,
                    on the one hand, and his reverence for womanly propriety, on the other hand, had
                    kept his charms and his income unshared. </p>
                <p>Toward the end of Spenser's first year on the _Herald_&mdash;it was early
                    summer&mdash;he fell into a melancholy so 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0512" n="489"/>
                    profound and so prolonged that
                    Susan became alarmed. She was used to his having those fits of the blues that
                    are a part of the nervous, morbidly sensitive nature and in the unhealthfulness
                    of an irregular and dissipated life recur at brief intervals. He spent more and
                    more time with her, became as ardent as in their first days together, with an
                    added desperation of passionate clinging that touched her to the depths. She had
                    early learned to ignore his moods, to avoid sympathy which aggravates, and to
                    meet his blues with a vigorous counterirritant of liveliness. After watching the
                    course of this acute attack for more than a month, she decided that at the first
                    opportunity she would try to find out from Drumley what the cause was. Perhaps
                    she could cure him if she were not working in the dark. </p>
                <p>One June evening Drumley came to take her to dinner at the Casino in Central
                    Park. She hesitated. She still liked Drumley's mind; but latterly he had fallen
                    into the way of gazing furtively, with a repulsive tremulousness of his loose
                    eyelids, at her form and at her ankles&mdash;especially at her
                    ankles&mdash;especially at her ankles. This furtive debauch gave her a
                    shivery sense of intrusion. She distinctly liked the candid, even the not too
                    coarse, glances of the usual man. But not this shy peeping. However, as there
                    were books she particularly wished to talk about with him, she accepted. </p>
                <p>It was an excursion of which she was fond. They strolled along Seventh Avenue to
                    the Park, entered and followed the lovely walk, quiet and green and odorous, to
                    the Mall. They sauntered in the fading light up the broad Mall, with its roof of
                    boughs of majestic trees, with its pale blue vistas of well-kept lawns. At the
                    steps leading to the Casino they paused to delight in the profusely blooming
                    wistaria and to gaze away 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0513" n="490"/>
                    northward into and over what seemed an endless forest
                    with towers and cupolas of castle and fortress and cathedral rising serene and
                    graceful here and there above the sea of green. There was the sound of tinkling
                    fountains, the musical chink-chink of harness chains of elegant equipages; on
                    the Mall hundreds of children were playing furiously, to enjoy to the uttermost
                    the last few moments before being snatched away to bed&mdash;and the birds
                    were in the same hysterical state as they got ready for their evening song. The
                    air was saturated with the fresh odors of spring and early summer flowers.
                    Susan, walking beside the homely Drumley, was a charming and stylish figure of
                    girlish womanhood. The year and three months in New York had wrought the same
                    transformations in her that are so noticeable whenever an intelligent and
                    observant woman with taste for the luxuries is dipped in the magic of city life.
                    She had grown, was now perhaps a shade above the medium height for women, looked
                    even taller because of the slenderness of her arms, of her neck, of the lines of
                    her figure. There was a deeper melancholy in her violet-gray eyes. Experience
                    had increased the allure of her wide, beautifully curved mouth. </p>
                <p>They took a table under the trees, with beds of blooming flowers on either hand.
                    Drumley ordered the sort of dinner she liked, and a bottle of champagne and a
                    bottle of fine burgundy to make his favorite drink&mdash;champagne and
                    burgundy, half and half. He was running to poetry that evening&mdash;Keats
                    and Swinburne. Finally, after some hesitation, he produced a poem by
                    Dowson&mdash;"I ran across it today. It's the only thing of his worth while,
                    I believe&mdash;and it's so fine that Swinburne must have been sore when he
                    read it because he 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0514" n="491"/>
                    
                    hadn't thought to write it himself. Its moral tone is not
                    high, but it's so beautiful, Mrs. Susan, that I'll venture to show it to you. It
                    comes nearer to expressing what men mean by the man sort of constancy than
                    anything I ever read. Listen to this: </p>

                <lg type="verse">

                    <l>"I cried for madder music and for stronger wine,</l>
                    <l>But when the feast is finished, and the lamps expire,</l>
                    <l>Then falls thy shadow, Cynara!&mdash;the night is thine;</l>
                    <l>And I am desolate and sick of an old passion,</l>
                    <l>Yea, hungry for the lips of my desire;</l>
                    <l>I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in my fashion."</l>

                </lg>
                <p> Susan took the paper, read the four stanzas several times, handed it back to him
                    without a word. "Don't you think it fine?" asked he, a little
                    uneasily&mdash;he was always uneasy with a woman when the conversation
                    touched the relations of the sexes&mdash;uneasy lest he might say or might
                    have said something to send a shiver through her delicate modesty. </p>
                <p>"Fine," Susan echoed absently. "And true. . . . I suppose it is the best a woman
                    can expect&mdash;to be the one he returns to. And&mdash;isn't that
                    enough?" </p>
                <p>"You are very different from any woman I ever met," said Drumley. "Very different
                    from what you were last fall&mdash;wonderfully different. But you were
                    different then, too." </p>
                <p>"I'd have been a strange sort of person if it weren't so. I've led a different
                    life. I've learned&mdash;because I've had to learn." </p>
                <p>"You've been through a great deal&mdash;suffered a great deal for one of your
                    age?" </p>
                <p>Susan shrugged her shoulders slightly. She had her impulses to confide, but she
                    had yet to meet the person 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0515" n="492"/>
                    who seriously tempted her to yield to them. Not even
                    Rod; no, least of all Rod. </p>
                <p>"You are&mdash;happy?" </p>
                <p>"Happy&mdash;and more. I'm content." </p>
                <p>The reply was the truth, as she saw the truth. Perhaps it was also the absolute
                    truth; for when a woman has the best she has ever actually possessed, and when
                    she knows there is nowhere else on earth for her, she is likely to be content.
                    Their destiny of subordination has made philosophers of women. </p>
                <p>Drumley seemed to be debating how to disclose something he had in mind. But after
                    several glances at the sweet, delicate face of the girl, he gave it over. In the
                    subdued light from the shaded candles on their table, she looked more child-like
                    than he had ever seen. Perhaps her big pale-blue hat and graceful pale-blue
                    summer dress had something to do with it, also. "How old are you?" he asked
                    abruptly. </p>
                <p>"Nearly nineteen." </p>
                <p>"I feel like saying, `So much!'&mdash;and also `So little!' How long have you
                    been married?" </p>
                <p>"Why all these questions?" demanded she, smiling. </p>
                <p>He colored with embarrassment. "I didn't mean to be impertinent," said he. </p>
                <p>"It isn't impertinence&mdash;is it?&mdash;to ask a woman how long she's
                    been married." </p>
                <p>But she did not go on to tell him; instead, she pretended to have her attention
                    distracted by a very old man and a very young girl behaving in most lover-like
                    fashion, the girl outdoing the man in enthusiastic determination to convince.
                    She was elegantly and badly dressed in new clothes&mdash;and she seemed as
                    new to that kind of clothes as those particular clothes were new to her. After
                    dinner they walked down through the Park 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0516" n="493"/>
                    by the way they had come; it did not
                    look like the same scene now, with the moonlight upon it, with soft shadows
                    everywhere and in every shadow a pair of lovers. They had nearly reached the
                    entrance when Drumley said: "Let's sit on this bench here. I want to have a
                    serious talk with you." </p>
                <p>Susan seated herself and waited. He lit a cigar with the deliberation of one who
                    is striving to gain time. The bench happened to be one of those that are divided
                    by iron arms into individual seats. He sat with a compartment between them. The
                    moonbeams struck across his profile as he turned it toward her; they shone full
                    upon her face. He looked, hastily glanced away. With a gruffness as if the
                    evening mist had got into his throat he said: </p>
                <p>"Let's take another bench." </p>
                <p>"Why?" objected she. "I like this beautiful light." </p>
                <p>He rose. "Please let me have my way." And he led her to a bench across which a
                    tree threw a deep shadow; as they sat there, neither could see the other's face
                    except in dimmest outline. After a brief silence he began: </p>
                <p>"You love Rod&mdash;don't you?" </p>
                <p>She laughed happily. </p>
                <p>"Above everything on earth?" </p>
                <p>"Or in heaven." </p>
                <p>"You'd do anything to have him succeed?" </p>
                <p>"No one could prevent his succeeding. He's got it in him. It's bound to come
                    out." </p>
                <p>"So I'd have said&mdash;until a year ago&mdash;that is, about a year
                    ago." </p>
                <p>As her face turned quickly toward him, he turned profile to her. "What do you
                    mean?" said she, quickly, almost imperiously. </p>
                <p>"Yes&mdash;I mean _you_," replied he. </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0517" n="494"/>
                <p>"You mean you think I'm hindering him?" </p>
                <p>When Drumley's voice finally came, it was funereally solemn. "You are dragging
                    him down. You are killing his ambition." </p>
                <p>"You don't understand," she protested with painful expression. "If you did, you
                    wouldn't say that." </p>
                <p>"You mean because he is not true to you?" </p>
                <p>"Isn't he?" said she, loyally trying to pretend surprise. "If that's so, you've
                    no right to tell me&mdash;you, his friend. If it isn't, you&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"In either case I'd be beneath contempt&mdash;unless I knew that you knew
                    already. Oh, I've known a long time that you knew&mdash;ever since the night
                    you looked away when he absentmindedly pulled a woman's veil and gloves out of
                    his pocket. I've watched you since then, and I know." </p>
                <p>"You are a very dear friend, Mr. Drumley," said she. "But you must not talk of
                    him to me." </p>
                <p>"I must," he replied. And he hastened to make the self-fooled hypocrite's
                    familiar move to the safety of duty's skirts. "It would be a crime to keep
                    silent." </p>
                <p>She rose. "I can't listen. It may be your duty to speak. It's my duty to refuse
                    to hear." </p>
                <p>"He is overwhelmed with debt. He is about to lose his position. It is all because
                    he is degraded&mdash;because he feels he is entangled in an intrigue with a
                    woman he is ashamed to love&mdash;a woman he has struggled in vain to put
                    out of his heart." </p>
                <p>Susan, suddenly weak, had seated herself again. From his first words she had been
                    prey to an internal struggle&mdash;her heart fighting against understanding
                    things about her relations with Rod, about his feeling toward her, which she had
                    long been contriving to hide 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0518" n="495"/>
                    from herself. When Drumley began she knew that the
                    end of self-deception was at hand&mdash;if she let him speak. But the
                    instant he had spoken, the struggle ended. If he had tried to stop she would
                    have compelled him to go on. </p>
                <p>"That woman is you," he continued in the same solemn measured way. "Rod will not
                    marry you. He cannot leave you. And you are dragging him down. You are young.
                    You don't know that passionate love is a man's worst enemy. It satisfies his
                    ambition&mdash;why struggle when one already has attained the climax of
                    desire? It saps his strength, takes from him the energy without which
                    achievement is impossible. Passion dies poisoned of its own sweets. But
                    passionate love kills&mdash;at least, it kills the man. If you did not love
                    him, I'd not be talking to you now. But you do love him. So I say, you are
                    killing him. . . . Don't think he has told me " </p>
                <p>"I know he didn't," she interrupted curtly. "He does not whine." </p>
                <p>She hadn't a doubt of the truth of her loyal defense. And Drumley could not have
                    raised a doubt, even if she had been seeing the expression of his face. His long
                    practice of the modern editorial art of clearness and brevity and compact
                    statement had enabled him to put into those few sentences more than another
                    might have been unable to express in hours of explanation and appeal. And the
                    ideas were not new to her. Rod had often talked them in a general way and she
                    had thought much about them. Until now she had never seen how they applied to
                    Rod and herself. But she was seeing and feeling it now so acutely that if she
                    had tried to speak or to move she could not have done so. </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0519" n="496"/>
                <p>After a long pause, Drumley said: "Do you comprehend what I mean?" </p>
                <p>She was silent&mdash;so it was certain that she comprehended. "But you don't
                    believe?. . . He began to borrow money almost immediately on his arrival here
                    last summer. He has been borrowing ever since&mdash;from everybody and
                    anybody. He owes now, as nearly as I can find out, upwards of three thousand
                    dollars." </p>
                <p>Susan made a slight but sharp movement. </p>
                <p>"You don't believe me?" </p>
                <p>"Yes. Go on." </p>
                <p>"He has it in him, I'm confident, to write plays&mdash;strong plays. Does he
                    ever write except ephemeral space stuff for the paper?" </p>
                <p>"No." </p>
                <p>"And he never will so long as he has you to go home to. He lives beyond his means
                    because he will have you in comfortable surroundings and dressed to stimulate
                    his passion. If he would marry you, it might be a little better&mdash;though
                    still he would never amount to anything as long as his love lasted&mdash;the
                    kind of love you inspire. But he will never marry you. I learned that from what
                    I know of his ideas and from what I've observed as to your
                    relations&mdash;not from anything he ever said about you." </p>
                <p>If Susan had been of the suspicious temperament, or if she had been a few years
                    older, the manner of this second protest might have set her to thinking how
                    unlike Drumley, the inexpert in matters of love and passion, it was to analyze
                    thus and to form such judgments. And thence she might have gone on to consider
                    that Drumley's speeches sounded strangely like paraphrases of Spenser's eloquent
                    outbursts when 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0520" n="497"/>
                    he "got going." But she had not a suspicion. Besides, her whole
                    being was concentrated upon the idea Drumley was trying to put into words. She
                    asked: </p>
                <p>"Why are you telling me?" </p>
                <p>"Because I love him," replied Drumley with feeling. "We're about the same age,
                    but he's been like my son ever since we struck up a friendship in the first term
                    of Freshman year." </p>
                <p>"Is that your only reason?" </p>
                <p>"On my honor." And so firmly did he believe it, he bore her scrutiny as she
                    peered into his face through the dimness. </p>
                <p>She drew back. "Yes," she said in a low voice, half to herself. "Yes, I believe
                    it is." There was silence for a long time, then she asked quietly: </p>
                <p>"What do you think I ought to do?" </p>
                <p>"Leave him&mdash;if you love him," replied Drumley. </p>
                <p>"What else can you do?. . . Stay on and complete his ruin?" </p>
                <p>"And if I go&mdash;what?" </p>
                <p>"Oh, you can do any one of many things. You can&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"I mean&mdash;what about him?" </p>
                <p>"He will be like a crazy man for a while. He'll make that a fresh excuse for
                    keeping on as he's going now. Then he'll brace up, and I'll be watching over
                    him, and I'll put him to work in the right direction. He can't be saved, he
                    can't even be kept afloat as long as you are with him, or within reach. With you
                    gone out of his life&mdash;his strength will return, his self-respect can be
                    roused. I've seen the same thing in other cases again and again. I could tell
                    you any number of stories of&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"He does not care for me?" </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0521" n="498"/>
                <p>"In _one_ way, a great deal. But you're like drink, like a drug to him. It is
                    strange that a woman such as you, devoted, single-hearted, utterly loving,
                    should be an influence for bad. But it's true of wives also. The best wives are
                    often the worst. The philosophers are right. A man needs tranquillity at home." </p>
                <p>"I understand," said she. "I understand&mdash;perfectly. " And her voice was
                    unemotional, as always when she was so deeply moved that she dared not release
                    anything lest all should be released. </p>
                <p>She was like a seated statue. The moon had moved so that it shone upon her face.
                    He was astonished by its placid calm. He had expected her to rave and weep, to
                    protest and plead&mdash;before denouncing him and bidding him mind his own
                    business. Instead, she was making it clear that after all she did not care about
                    Roderick; probabLy she was wondering what would become of her, now that her love
                    was ruined. Well, wasn't it natural? Wasn't it altogether to her
                    credit&mdash;wasn't it additional proof that she was a fine pure woman? How
                    could she have continued deeply to care for a man scandalously untrue, and drunk
                    much of the time? Certainly, it was in no way her fault that Rod made her the
                    object and the victim of the only kind of so-called love of which he was
                    capable. No doubt one reason he was untrue to her was that she was too pure for
                    his debauched fancy. Thus reasoned Drumley with that mingling of truth and error
                    characteristic of those who speculate about matters of which they have small and
                    unfixed experience. </p>
                <p>"About yourself," he proceeded. "I have a choice of professions for
                    you&mdash;one with a company on the road&mdash;on the southern
                    circuit&mdash;with good prospects of advancement. I know, from what I have
                    seen of you, 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0522" n="499"/>
                    and from talks we have had, that you would do well on the stage.
                    But the life might offend your sensibilities. I should hesitate to recommend it
                    to a delicate, fine-fibered woman like you. The other position is a clerkship in
                    a business office in Philadelphia&mdash;with an increase as soon as you
                    learn stenography and typewriting. It is respectable. It is sheltered. It
                    doesn't offer anything brilliant. But except the stage and literature, nothing
                    brilliant offers for a woman. Literature is out of the question, I
                    think&mdash;certainly for the present. The stage isn't really a place for a
                    woman of lady-like instincts. So I should recommend the office position." </p>
                <p>She remained silent. </p>
                <p>"While my main purpose in talking to you," he continued, "was to try to save him,
                    I can honestly say that it was hardly less my intention to save you. But for
                    that, I'd not have had the courage to speak. He is on the way down. He's
                    dragging you with him. What future have you with him? You would go on down and
                    down, as low as he should sink and lower. You've completely merged yourself in
                    him&mdash;which might do very well if you were his wife and a good influence
                    in his life or a mere negation like most wives. But in the circumstances it
                    means ruin to you. Don't you see that?" </p>
                <p>"What did you say?" </p>
                <p>"I was talking about you&mdash;your future your&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Oh, I shall do well enough." She rose. "I must be going." </p>
                <p>Her short, indifferent dismissal of what was his real object in
                    speaking&mdash;though he did not permit himself to know it&mdash;cut him
                    to the quick. He felt a sickening and to him inexplicable sense of defeat and
                    disgrace. 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0523" n="500"/>
                    Because he must talk to distract his mind from himself, he began
                    afresh by saying: </p>
                <p>"You'll think it over?" </p>
                <p>"I am thinking it over. . . . I wonder that&mdash;" </p>
                <p>With the fingers of one hand she smoothed her glove on the fingers of the
                    other&mdash;"I wonder that I didn't think of it long ago. I ought to have
                    thought of it. I ought to have seen." </p>
                <p>"I can't tell you how I hate to have been the&mdash;" </p>
                <p>"Please don't say any more," she requested in a tone that made it impossible for
                    a man so timid as he to disobey. </p>
                <p>Neither spoke until they were in Fifty-ninth Street; then he, unable to stand the
                    strain of a silent walk of fifteen blocks, suggested that they take the car
                    down. She assented. In the car the stronger light enabled him to see that she
                    was pale in a way quite different from her usual clear, healthy pallor, that
                    there was an unfamiliar look about her mouth and her eyes&mdash;a look of
                    strain, of repression, of resolve. These signs and the contrast of her mute
                    motionlessness with her usual vivacity of speech and expression and gesture made
                    him uneasy. </p>
                <p>"I'd advise," said he, "that you reflect on it all carefully and consult with me
                    before you do anything&mdash;if you think you ought to do anything." </p>
                <p>She made no reply. At the door of the house he had to reach for her hand, and her
                    answer to his good night was a vague absent echo of the word. "I've only done
                    what I saw was my duty," said he, appealingly. </p>
                <p>"Yes, I suppose so. I must go in." </p>
                <p>"And you'll talk with me before you&mdash;" </p>
                <p>The door had closed behind her; she had not known he was speaking. </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0524" n="501"/>
                <p>When Spenser came, about two hours later, and turned on the light in their
                    bedroom, she was in the bed, apparently asleep. He stood staring with theatric
                    self-consciousness at himself in the glass for several minutes, then sat down
                    before the bureau and pulled out the third drawer&mdash;where he kept
                    collars, ties, handkerchiefs, gloves and a pistol concealed under the
                    handkerchiefs. With the awful solemnity of the youth who takes
                    himself&mdash;and the theater&mdash;seriously he lifted the pistol, eyed
                    it critically, turning it this way and that as if interested in the reflections
                    of light from the bright cylinder and barrel at different angles. He laid it
                    noiselessly back, covered it over with the handkerchiefs, sat with his fingers
                    resting on the edge of the drawer. Presently he moved uneasily, as a
                    man&mdash;on the stage or in its amusing imitation called civilized life
                    among the self-conscious classes&mdash;moves when he feels that someone is
                    behind him in a "crucial moment." </p>
                <p>He slowly turned round. She had shifted her position so that her face was now
                    toward him. But her eyes were closed and her face was tranquil. Still, he hoped
                    she had seen the little episode of the pistol, which he thought fine and
                    impressive. With his arm on the back of the chair and supporting that
                    resolute-looking chin of his, he stared at her face from under his thick
                    eyebrows, so thick that although they were almost as fair as his hair they
                    seemed dark. After a while her eyelids fluttered and lifted to disclose eyes
                    that startled him, so intense, so sleepless were they. </p>
                <p>"Kiss me," she said, in her usual sweet, tender way&mdash;a little shyness,
                    much of passion's sparkle and allure. "Kiss me." </p>
                <p>"I've often thought," said he, "what would I do 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0525" n="502"/>
                    if I should go smash, reach the
                    end of my string? Would I kill you before taking myself off? Or would that be
                    cowardly?" </p>
                <p>She had not a doubt that he meant this melodramatic twaddle. It did not seem
                    twaddle or melodramatic to her&mdash;or, for that matter, to him. She
                    clasped him more closely. "What's the matter, dear?" she asked, her head on his
                    breast. </p>
                <p>"Oh, I've had a row at the _Herald_, and have quit. But I'll get another place
                    tomorrow." </p>
                <p>"Of course. I wish you'd fix up that play the way Drumley suggested." </p>
                <p>"Maybe I shall. We'll see." </p>
                <p>"Anything else wrong?" </p>
                <p>"Only the same old trouble. I love you too much. Too damn much," he added in a
                    tone not intended for her ears. "Weak fool&mdash;that's what I am. Weak
                    fool. I've got _you_, anyhow. Haven't I?" </p>
                <p>"Yes," she said. "I'd do anything for you&mdash;anything." </p>
                <p>"As long as I keep my eyes on you," said he, half mockingly. "I'm weak, but
                    you're weaker. Aren't you?" </p>
                <p>"I guess so. I don't know." And she drew a long breath, nestled into his arms,
                    and upon his breast, with her perfumed hair drowsing his senses. </p>
                <p>He soon slept; when he awoke, toward noon, he did not disturb her. He shaved and
                    bathed and dressed, and was about to go out when she called him. "Oh, I thought
                    you were asleep," said he. "I can't wait for you to get breakfast. I must get a
                    move on." </p>
                <p>"Still blue?" </p>
                <p>"No, indeed." But his face was not convincing. "So long, pet." </p>
                
                
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0526" n="503"/>
                <p>"Aren't you going to kiss me good-by?" </p>
                <p>He laughed tenderly, yet in bitter self-mockery too. "And waste an hour or so?
                    Not much. What a siren you are!" </p>
                <p>She put her hand over her face quickly. </p>
                <p>"Now, perhaps I can risk one kiss." He bent over her; his lips touched her hair.
                    She stretched out her hand, laid it against his cheek. "Dearest," she murmured. </p>
                <p>"I must go." </p>
                <p>"Just a minute. No, don't look at me. Turn your face so that I can see your
                    profile&mdash;so!" She had turned his head with a hand that gently caressed
                    as it pushed. "I like that view best. Yes, you are strong and brave. You will
                    succeed! No&mdash;I'll not keep you a minute." She kissed his hand, rested
                    her head for an instant on his lap as he sat on the edge of the bed, suddenly
                    flung herself to the far side of the bed, with her face toward the wall. </p>
                <p>"Go to sleep again, lazy!" cried he. "I'll try to be home about dinner-time. See
                    that you behave today! Good lord, how hard it is to leave you! Having you makes
                    nothing else seem worth while. Good-by!" </p>
                <p>And he was off. She started to a sitting posture, listened to the faint sound of
                    his descending footsteps. She darted to the window, leaned out, watched him
                    until he rounded the corner into Broadway. Then she dropped down with elbows on
                    the window sill and hands pressing her cheeks; she stared unseeingly at the
                    opposite house, at a gilt cage with a canary hopping and chirping within. And
                    once more she thought all the thoughts that had filled her mind in the sleepless
                    hours of that night and morning. Her eyes shifted in color from pure gray to
                    pure violet&mdash;back and forth, as 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0527" n="504"/>
                    emotion or thought dominated her mind.
                    She made herself coffee in the French machine, heated the milk she brought every
                    day from the dairy, drank her _cafe au lait_ slowly, reading the newspaper
                    advertisements for "help wanted&mdash;female"&mdash;a habit she had
                    formed when she first came to New York and had never altogether dropped. When
                    she finished her coffee she took the scissors and cut out several of the demands
                    for help. </p>
                <p>She bathed and dressed. She moved through the routine of life&mdash;precisely
                    as we all do, whatever may be in our minds and hearts. She went out, crossed
                    Long Acre and entered the shop of a dealer in women's cast-off clothes. She
                    reappeared in the street presently with a fat, sloppy looking woman in black.
                    She took her to the rooms, offered for sale her entire wardrobe except the dress
                    she had on and one other, the simply trimmed sailor upon her head, the ties on
                    her feet and one pair of boots and a few small articles. After long haggling the
                    woman made a final price&mdash;ninety-five dollars for things, most of them
                    almost new, which had cost upwards of seven hundred. Susan accepted the offer;
                    she knew she could do no better. The woman departed, returned with a porter and
                    several huge sweets of wrapping paper. The two made three bundles of the
                    purchases; the money was paid over; they and Susan's wardrobe departed. </p>
                <p>Next, Susan packed in the traveling bag she had brought from Cincinnati the
                    between seasons dress of brown serge she had withheld, and some such collection
                    of bare necessities as she had taken with her when she left George Warham's.
                    Into the bag she put the pistol from under Spenser's handkerchiefs in the third
                    bureau drawer. When all was ready, she sent for the maid to 
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002729_0528" n="505"/>
                    straighten the
                    rooms. While the maid was at work, she wrote this note: </p>
                <p> DEAREST&mdash;Mr. Drumley will tell you why I have gone. You will find some
                    money under your handkerchiefs in the bureau. When you are on your feet again, I
                    may come&mdash;if you want me. It won't be any use for you to look for me. I
                    ought to have gone before, but I was selfish and blind. Good-by, dear
                    love&mdash;I wasn't so bad as you always suspected. I was true to you, and
                    for the sake of what you have been to me and done for me I couldn't be so
                    ungrateful as not to go. Don't worry about me. I shall get on. And so will you.
                    It's best for us both. Good-by, dear heart&mdash;I was true to you. Good-by. </p>
                <p> She sealed this note, addressed it, fastened it over the mantel in the
                    sitting-room where they always put notes for each other. And after she had
                    looked in each drawer and in the closet at all his clothing, and had kissed the
                    pillow on which his head had lain, she took her bag and went. She had left for
                    him the ninety-five dollars and also eleven dollars of the money she had in her
                    purse. She took with her two five-dollar bills and a dollar and forty cents in
                    change. </p>

                    action. </p>
