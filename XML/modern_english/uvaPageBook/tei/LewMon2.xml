            <head>Continuation of the History of Don Raymond.</head>
            <p>MY JOURNEY WAS uncommonly agreeable: I found the Baron a Man of some sense,
              but little knowledge of the world. He had past a great part of his life
              without stirring beyond the precincts of his own <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0015" n="2"/>domains, and consequently his manners
              were far from being the most polished: But He was hearty, good-humoured, and
              friendly. His attention to me was all that I could wish, and I had every
              reason to be satisfied with his behaviour. His ruling passion was Hunting,
              which He had brought himself to consider as a serious occupation; and when
              talking over some remarkable chace, He treated the subject with as much
              gravity, as it had been a Battle on which the fate of two kingdoms was
              depending. I happened to be a tolerable Sportsman: Soon after my arrival at
              Lindenberg I gave some proofs of my dexterity. The Baron immediately marked
              me down for a Man of Genius, and vowed to me an eternal friendship. </p>
            <p>That friendship was become to me by no means indifferent. At the Castle of
              Lindenberg I beheld for the first time your Sister, the lovely Agnes. For me
              whose heart was unoccupied, and who grieved at the void, to see her and to
              love her were the same. I found in Agnes all that was <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0016" n="3"/>requisite to secure my affection. She
              was then scarcely sixteen; Her person light and elegant was already formed;
              She possessed several talents in perfection, particularly those of Music and
              drawing: Her character was gay, open, and good-humoured; and the graceful
              simplicity of her dress and manners formed an advantageous contrast to the
              art and studied Coquetry of the Parisian Dames, whom I had just quitted.
              From the moment that I beheld her, I felt the most lively interest in her
              fate. I made many enquiries respecting her of the Baroness. </p>
            <p>`She is my Niece,' replied that Lady; `You are still ignorant, Don
              Alphonso, that I am your Countrywoman. I am Sister to the Duke of Medina
              Celi: Agnes is the Daughter of my second Brother, Don Gaston: She has been
              destined to the Convent from her cradle, and will soon make her profession
              at Madrid.' </p>
            <p>[Here Lorenzo interrupted the Marquis by an exclamation of surprise. </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0017" n="4"/>`Intended for the Convent from her
              cradle?' said He; `By heaven, this is the first word that I ever heard of
              such a design!' </p>
            <p>`I believe it, my dear Lorenzo,' answered Don Raymond; `But you must listen
              to me with patience. You will not be less surprised, when I relate some
              particulars of your family still unknown to you, and which I have learnt
              from the mouth of Agnes herself.' </p>
            <p>He then resumed his narrative as follows.] </p>
            <p>You cannot but be aware, that your Parents were unfortunately Slaves to the
              grossest superstition: When this foible was called into play, their every
              other sentiment, their every other passion yielded to its irresistible
              strength. While She was big with Agnes, your Mother was seized by a
              dangerous illness, and given over by her Physicians. In this situation,
              Donna Inesilla vowed, that if She recovered from her malady, the Child then
              living in her bosom if a Girl should be dedicated to St. Clare, if a Boy to
              St. <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0018" n="5"/>Benedict. Her prayers were
              heard; She got rid of her complaint; Agnes entered the world alive, and was
              immediately destined to the service of St. Clare. </p>
            <p>Don Gaston readily chimed in with his Lady's wishes: But knowing the
              sentiments of the Duke, his Brother, respecting a Monastic life, it was
              determined that your Sister's destination should be carefully concealed from
              him. The better to guard the secret, it was resolved that Agnes should
              accompany her Aunt, Donna Rodolpha into Germany, whither that Lady was on
              the point of following her new-married Husband, Baron Lindenberg. On her
              arrival at that Estate, the young Agnes was put into a Convent, situated but
              a few miles from the Castle. The Nuns, to whom her education was confided,
              performed their charge with exactitude: They made her a perfect Mistress of
              many talents, and strove to infuse into her mind a taste for the retirement
              and tranquil pleasures of a Convent. But a secret instinct made the young
              Recluse sensible <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0019" n="6"/>that She was not
              born for solitude: In all the freedom of youth and gaiety She scrupled not
              to treat as ridiculous many ceremonies, which the Nuns regarded with awe;
              and She was never more happy than when her lively imagination inspired her
              with some scheme to plague the stiff Lady Abbess, or the ugly ill- tempered
              old Porteress. She looked with disgust upon the prospect before her: However
              no alternative was offered to her, and She submitted to the decree of her
              Parents, though not without secret repining. </p>
            <p>That repugnance She had not art enough to conceal long: Don Gaston was
              informed of it. Alarmed, Lorenzo, lest your affection for her should oppose
              itself to his projects, and lest you should positively object to your
              Sister's misery, He resolved to keep the whole affair from <hi rend="italic"
                >your</hi> knowledge as well as the Duke's, till the sacrifice should be
              consummated. The season of her taking the veil was fixed for the time when
              you should be upon your travels: In the mean while no hint was dropped of
              Donna <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0020" n="7"/>Inesilla's fatal vow. Your
              Sister was never permitted to know your direction. All your letters were
              read before She received them, and those parts effaced, which were likely to
              nourish her inclination for the world: Her answers were dictated either by
              her Aunt, or by Dame Cunegonda, her Governess. These particulars I learnt
              partly from Agnes, partly from the Baroness herself. </p>
            <p>I immediately determined upon rescuing this lovely Girl from a fate so
              contrary to her inclinations, and ill- suited to her merit. I endeavoured to
              ingratiate myself into her favour: I boasted of my friendship and intimacy
              with you. She listened to me with avidity; She seemed to devour my words
              while I spoke in your praise, and her eyes thanked me for my affection to
              her Brother. My constant and unremitted attention at length gained me her
              heart, and with difficulty I obliged her to confess that She loved me. When
              however, I proposed her <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0021" n="8"/> quitting
              the Castle of Lindenberg, She rejected the idea in positive terms. </p>
            <p>`Be generous, Alphonso,' She said; `You possess my heart, but use not the
              gift ignobly. Employ not your ascendancy over me in persuading me to take a
              step, at which I should here-after have to blush. I am young and deserted:
              My Brother, my only Friend, is separated from me, and my other Relations act
              with me as my Enemies. Take pity on my unprotected situation. Instead of
              seducing me to an action which would cover me with shame, strive rather to
              gain the affections of those who govern me. The Baron esteems you. My Aunt,
              to others ever harsh proud and contemptuous, remembers that you rescued her
              from the hands of Murderers, and wears with you alone the appearance of
              kindness and benignity. Try then your influence over my Guardians. If they
              consent to our union my hand is yours: From your account of my Brother, I
              cannot doubt your obtaining <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0022" n="9"/> his
              approbation: And when they find the impossibility of executing their design,
              I trust that my Parents will excuse my disobedience, and expiate by some
              other sacrifice my Mother's fatal vow.' </p>
            <p>From the first moment that I beheld Agnes, I had endeavoured to conciliate
              the favour of her Relations. Authorised by the confession of her regard, I
              redoubled my exertions. My principal Battery was directed against the
              Baroness; It was easy to discover, that her word was law in the Castle: Her
              Husband paid her the most absolute submission, and considered her as a
              superior Being. She was about forty: In her youth She had been a Beauty; But
              her charms had been upon that large scale which can but ill sustain the
              shock of years: However She still possessed some remains of them. Her
              understanding was strong and excellent when not obscured by prejudice, which
              unluckily was but seldom the case. Her passions were violent: She spared no
              pains to gratify them, and pursued with unremitting <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0023" n="10"/>vengeance those who opposed
              themselves to her wishes. The warmest of Friends, the most inveterate of
              Enemies, such was the Baroness Lindenberg. </p>
            <p>I laboured incessantly to please her: Unluckily I succeeded but too well.
              She seemed gratified by my attention, and treated me with a distinction
              accorded by her to no one else. One of my daily occupations was reading to
              her for several hours: Those hours I should much rather have past with
              Agnes; But as I was conscious, that complaisance for her Aunt would advance
              our union, I submitted with a good grace to the penance imposed upon me.
              Donna Rodolpha's Library was principally composed of old Spanish Romances:
              These were her favourite studies, and once a day one of these unmerciful
              Volumes was put regularly into my hands. I read the wearisome adventures of
                `<hi rend="italic">Perceforest</hi>,' `<hi rend="italic">Tirante the
                White</hi>,' `<hi rend="italic">Palmerin of England</hi>,' and `<hi
                rend="italic">the Knight of the Sun</hi>,' till the Book was on the point
              of falling from my hands through <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0024" n="11"
              />Ennui. However, the increasing pleasure which the Baroness seemed to take
              in my society, encouraged me to persevere; and latterly She showed for me a
              partiality so marked, that Agnes advised me to seize the first opportunity
              of declaring our mutual passion to her Aunt. </p>
            <p>One Evening, I was alone with Donna Rodolpha in her own apartment. As our
              readings generally treated of love, Agnes was never permitted to assist at
              them. I was just congratulating myself on having finished `<hi rend="italic"
                >the Loves of Tristan and the Queen Iseult</hi>----' </p>
            <p>`Ah! The Unfortunates!' cried the Baroness; `How say you, Segnor? Do you
              think it possible for Man to feel an attachment so disinterested and
              sincere?' </p>
            <p>`I cannot doubt it,' replied I; `My own heart furnishes me with the
              certainty. Ah! Donna Rodolpha, might I but hope for your approbation of my
              love! Might I but confess the name of my Mistress without incurring your
              resentment!' </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0025" n="12"/>She interrupted me. </p>
            <p>`Suppose, I were to spare you that confession? Suppose, I were to
              acknowledge, that the object of your desires is not unknown to me? Suppose,
              I were to say that She returns your affection, and laments not less
              sincerely than yourself, the unhappy vows which separate her from you?' </p>
            <p>`Ah! Donna Rodolpha!' I exclaimed, throwing myself upon my knees before
              her, and pressing her hand to my lips, `You have discovered my secret! What
              is your decision? Must I despair, or may I reckon upon your favour?' </p>
            <p>She withdrew not the hand which I held; But She turned from me, and covered
              her face with the other. </p>
            <p>`How can I refuse it you?' She replied; `Ah! Don Alphonso, I have long
              perceived to whom your attentions were directed, but till now I perceived
              not the impression which they made upon my heart. At length I can no longer
              hide my weakness either from myself or from you. I yield to <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0026" n="13"/>the violence of my passion, and own,
              that I adore you! For three long months I stifled my desires; But grown
              stronger by resistance, I submit to their impetuosity. Pride, fear, and
              honour, respect for myself, and my engagements to the Baron, all are
              vanquished. I sacrifice them to my love for you, and it still seems to me
              that I pay too mean a price for your possession.' </p>
            <p>She paused for an answer.--Judge, my Lorenzo, what must have been my
              confusion at this discovery. I at once saw all the magnitude of this
              obstacle, which I had raised myself to my happiness. The Baroness had placed
              those attentions to her own account, which I had merely paid her for the
              sake of Agnes: And the strength of her expressions, the looks which
              accompanied them, and my knowledge of her revengeful disposition made me
              tremble for myself and my Beloved. I was silent for some minutes. I knew not
              how to reply to her declaration: I could only resolve to clear up the
              mistake without delay, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0027" n="14"/>for the
              present to conceal from her knowledge the name of my Mistress. No sooner had
              She avowed her passion, than the transports which before were evident in my
              features, gave place to consternation and constraint. I dropped her hand,
              and rose from my knees. The change in my countenance did not escape her
              observation. </p>
            <p>`What means this silence?' said She in a trembling voice; `Where is that
              joy which you led me to expect?' </p>
            <p>`Forgive me, Segnora,' I answered, `if what necessity forces from me should
              seem harsh and ungrateful: To encourage you in an error, which, however it
              may flatter myself, must prove to you the source of disappointment, would
              make me appear criminal in every eye. Honour obliges me to inform you, that
              you have mistaken for the solicitude of Love what was only the attention of
              Friendship. The latter sentiment is that which I wished to excite in your
              bosom: To entertain a warmer, respect for you forbids me, and gratitude for
              the <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0028" n="15"/>Baron's generous treatment.
              Perhaps these reasons would not be sufficient to shield me from your
              attractions, were it not that my affections are already bestowed upon
              another. You have charms, Segnora, which might captivate the most
              insensible; No heart unoccupied could resist them. Happy is it for me that
              mine is no longer in my possession; or I should have to reproach myself for
              ever with having violated the Laws of Hospitality. Recollect yourself, noble
              Lady; Recollect what is owed by you to honour, by me to the Baron, and
              replace by esteem and friendship those sentiments which I never can return.' </p>
            <p>The Baroness turned pale at this unexpected and positive declaration: She
              doubted whether She slept or woke. At length recovering from her surprise,
              consternation gave place to rage, and the blood rushed back into her cheeks
              with violence. </p>
            <p>`Villain!' She cried; `Monster of deceit! Thus is the avowal of my love
              received? Is it thus that. . . . But no, no! It <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0029" n="16"/>cannot, it shall not be! Alphonso,
              behold me at your feet! Be witness of my despair! Look with pity on a Woman
              who loves you with sincere affection! She who possesses your heart, how has
              She merited such a treasure? What sacrifice has She made to you? What raises
              her above Rodolpha?' </p>
            <p>I endeavoured to lift her from her Knees. </p>
            <p>`For God's sake, Segnora, restrain these transports: They disgrace yourself
              and me. Your exclamations may be heard, and your secret divulged to your
              Attendants. I see, that my presence only irritates you: permit me to
              retire.' </p>
            <p>I prepared to quit the apartment: The Baroness caught me suddenly by the
              arm. </p>
            <p>`And who is this happy Rival?' said She in a menacing tone; `I will know
              her name, and <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I know it. . . . ! She is some one
              in my power; You entreated my favour, my protection! Let me but find her,
              let me but know who dares to rob me of your heart, and She shall suffer
              every torment, which jealousy and disappointment <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0030" n="17"/>can inflict! Who is She? Answer me
              this moment. Hope not to conceal her from my vengeance! Spies shall be set
              over you; every step, every look shall be watched; Your eyes will discover
              my Rival; I shall know her, and when She is found, tremble, Alphonso for her
              and for yourself!' </p>
            <p>As She uttered these last words her fury mounted to such a pitch as to stop
              her powers of respiration. She panted, groaned, and at length fainted away.
              As She was falling I caught her in my arms, and placed her upon a Sopha.
              Then hastening to the door, I summoned her Women to her assistance; I
              committed her to their care, and seized the opportunity of escaping. </p>
            <p>Agitated and confused beyond expression I bent my steps towards the Garden.
              The benignity with which the Baroness had listened to me at first raised my
              hopes to the highest pitch: I imagined her to have perceived my attachment
              for her Niece, and to approve of it. Extreme was my disappointment at
              understanding the true <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0031" n="18"/> purport of
              her discourse. I knew not what course to take: The superstition of the
              Parents of Agnes, aided by her Aunt's unfortunate passion, seemed to oppose
              such obstacles to our union as were almost insurmountable. </p>
            <p>As I past by a low parlour, whose windows looked into the Garden, through
              the door which stood half open I observed Agnes seated at a Table. She was
              occupied in drawing, and several unfinished sketches were scattered round
              her. I entered, still undetermined whether I should acquaint her with the
              declaration of the Baroness. </p>
            <p>`Oh! is it only you?' said She, raising her head; `You are no Stranger, and
              I shall continue my occupation without ceremony. Take a Chair, and seat
              yourself by me.' </p>
            <p>I obeyed, and placed myself near the Table. Unconscious what I was doing,
              and totally occupied by the scene which had just passed, I took up some of
              the drawings, <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0032" n="19"/>and cast my eye over
              them. One of the subjects struck me from its singularity. It represented the
              great Hall of the Castle of Lindenberg. A door conducting to a narrow
              stair-case stood half open. In the fore-ground appeared a Groupe of figures,
              placed in the most grotesque attitudes; Terror was expressed upon every
              countenance. Here was One upon his knees with his eyes cast up to heaven,
              and praying most devoutly; There Another was creeping away upon all fours.
              Some hid their faces in their cloaks or the laps of their Companions; Some
              had concealed themselves beneath a Table, on which the remnants of a feast
              were visible; While Others with gaping mouths and eyes wide- stretched
              pointed to a Figure, supposed to have created this disturbance. It
              represented a Female of more than human stature, clothed in the habit of
              some religious order. Her face was veiled; On her arm hung a chaplet of
              beads; Her dress was in several places stained with the blood which <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0033" n="20"/>trickled from a wound upon her bosom.
              In one hand She held a Lamp, in the other a large Knife, and She seemed
              advancing towards the iron gates of the Hall. </p>
            <p>`What does this mean, Agnes?' said I; `Is this some invention of your own?' </p>
            <p>She cast her eye upon the drawing. </p>
            <p>`Oh! no,' She replied; ` 'Tis the invention of much wiser heads than mine.
              But can you possibly have lived at Lindenberg for three whole Months without
              hearing of the Bleeding Nun?' </p>
            <p>`You are the first, who ever mentioned the name to me. Pray, who may the
              Lady be?' </p>
            <p>`That is more than I can pretend to tell you. All my knowledge of her
              History comes from an old tradition in this family, which has been handed
              down from Father to Son, and is firmly credited throughout the Baron's
              domains. Nay, the Baron believes it himself; and as for my Aunt who has a
              natural turn for the marvellous, She would <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0034"
                n="21"/>sooner doubt the veracity of the Bible, than of the Bleeding Nun.
              Shall I tell you this History?' </p>
            <p>I answered that She would oblige me much by relating it: She resumed her
              drawing, and then proceeded as follows in a tone of burlesqued gravity. </p>
            <p>`It is surprising that in all the Chronicles of past times, this remarkable
              Personage is never once mentioned. Fain would I recount to you her life; But
              unluckily till after her death She was never known to have existed. Then
              first did She think it necessary to make some noise in the world, and with
              that intention She made bold to seize upon the Castle of Lindenberg. Having
              a good taste, She took up her abode in the best room of the House: and once
              established there, She began to amuse herself by knocking about the tables
              and chairs in the middle of the night. Perhaps, She was a bad Sleeper, but
              this I have never been able to ascertain. According to the tradition, this
              entertainment commenced about <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0035" n="22"/> a
              Century ago. It was accompanied with shrieking, howling, groaning, swearing,
              and many other agreeable noises of the same kind. But though one particular
              room was more especially honoured with her visits, She did not entirely
              confine herself to it. She occasionally ventured into the old Galleries,
              paced up and down the spacious Halls, or sometimes stopping at the doors of
              the Chambers, She wept and wailed there to the universal terror of the
              Inhabitants. In these nocturnal excursions She was seen by different People,
              who all describe her appearance as you behold it here, traced by the hand of
              her unworthy Historian.' </p>
            <p>The singularity of this account insensibly engaged my attention. </p>
            <p>`Did She never speak to those who met her?' said I. </p>
            <p>`Not She. The specimens indeed which She gave nightly of her talents for
              conversation, were by no means inviting. Sometimes the Castle rung with
              oaths and <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0036" n="23"/>execrations: A Moment
              after She repeated her Paternoster: Now She howled out the most horrible
              blasphemies, and then chaunted De Profundis, as orderly as if still in the
              Choir. In short She seemed a mighty capricious Being: But whether She prayed
              or cursed, whether She was impious or devout, She always contrived to
              terrify her Auditors out of their senses. The Castle became scarcely
              habitable; and its Lord was so frightened by these midnight Revels, that one
              fine morning He was found dead in his bed. This success seemed to please the
              Nun mightily, for now She made more noise than ever. But the next Baron
              proved too cunning for her. He made his appearance with a celebrated
              Exorciser in his hand, who feared not to shut himself up for a night in the
              haunted Chamber. There it seems, that He had an hard battle with the Ghost,
              before She would promise to be quiet. She was obstinate, but He was more so,
              and at length She consented to let the Inhabitants of the Castle take a good
              night's rest.<pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0037" n="24"/> For some time after
              no news was heard of her. But at the end of five years the Exorciser died,
              and then the Nun ventured to peep abroad again. However, She was now grown
              much more tractable and well-behaved. She walked about in silence, and never
              made her appearance above once in five years. This custom, if you will
              believe the Baron, She still continues. He is fully persuaded, that on the
              fifth of May of every fifth year, as soon as the Clock strikes One the Door
              of the haunted Chamber opens. [Observe, that this room has been shut up for
              near a Century.] Then out walks the Ghostly Nun with her Lamp and dagger:
              She descends the stair-case of the Eastern Tower; and crosses the great
              Hall! On that night the Porter always leaves the Gates of the Castle open,
              out of respect to the Apparition: Not that this is thought by any means
              necessary, since She could easily whip through the Key-hole if She chose it;
              But merely out of politeness, and to prevent her from making her exit in a
              way so <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0038" n="25"/> derogatory to the dignity
              of her Ghost-ship.' </p>
            <p>`And whither does She go on quitting the Castle?' </p>
            <p>`To Heaven, I hope; But if She does, the place certainly is not to her
              taste, for She always returns after an hour's absence. The Lady then retires
              to her chamber, and is quiet for another five years.' </p>
            <p>`And you believe this, Agnes?' </p>
            <p>`How can you ask such a question? No, no, Alphonso! I have too much reason
              to lament superstition's influence to be its Victim myself. However I must
              not avow my incredulity to the Baroness: She entertains not a doubt of the
              truth of this History. As to Dame Cunegonda, my Governess, She protests that
              fifteen years ago She saw the Spectre with her own eyes. She related to me
              one evening, how She and several other Domestics had been terrified while at
              Supper by the appearance of the Bleeding Nun, as the Ghost is called in the
              Castle: 'Tis from her account that I drew this sketch,<pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0039" n="26"/> and you may be certain that
              Cunegonda was not omitted. There She is! I shall never forget what a passion
              She was in, and how ugly She looked while She scolded me for having made her
              picture so like herself!' </p>
            <p>Here She pointed to a burlesque figure of an old Woman in an attitude of
              terror. </p>
            <p>In spite of the melancholy which oppressed me, I could not help smiling at
              the playful imagination of Agnes: She had perfectly preserved Dame
              Cunegonda's resemblance, but had so much exaggerated every fault, and
              rendered every feature so irresistibly laughable, that I could easily
              conceive the Duenna's anger. </p>
            <p>`The figure is admirable, my dear Agnes! I knew not that you possessed such
              talents for the ridiculous.' </p>
            <p>`Stay a moment,' She replied; `I will show you a figure still more
              ridiculous than Dame Cunegonda's. If it pleases you, you may dispose of it
              as seems best to yourself.' </p>
            <p>She rose, and went to a Cabinet at some <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0040"
                n="27"/>little distance. Unlocking a drawer, She took out a small case,
              which She opened, and presented to me. </p>
            <p>`Do you know the resemblance?' said She smiling. </p>
            <p>It was her own. </p>
            <p>Transported at the gift, I pressed the portrait to my lips with passion: I
              threw myself at her feet, and declared my gratitude in the warmest and most
              affectionate terms. She listened to me with complaisance, and assured me
              that She shared my sentiments: When suddenly She uttered a loud shriek,
              disengaged the hand which I held, and flew from the room by a door which
              opened to the Garden. Amazed at this abrupt departure, I rose hastily from
              my knees. I beheld with confusion the Baroness standing near me glowing with
              jealousy, and almost choaked with rage. On recovering from her swoon, She
              had tortured her imagination to discover her concealed Rival. No one
              appeared to deserve her suspicions more than Agnes. She <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0041" n="28"/>immediately hastened to find her
              Niece, tax her with encouraging my addresses, and assure herself whether her
              conjectures were well- grounded. Unfortunately She had already seen enough
              to need no other confirmation. She arrived at the door of the room at the
              precise moment, when Agnes gave me her Portrait. She heard me profess an
              everlasting attachment to her Rival, and saw me kneeling at her feet. She
              advanced to separate us; We were too much occupied by each other to perceive
              her approach, and were not aware of it, till Agnes beheld her standing by my
              side. </p>
            <p>Rage on the part of Donna Rodolpha, embarrassment on mine, for some time
              kept us both silent. The Lady recovered herself first. </p>
            <p>`My suspicions then were just,' said She; `The Coquetry of my Niece has
              triumphed, and 'tis to her that I am sacrificed. In one respect however I am
              fortunate: I shall not be the only one who laments a disappointed passion.
              You too shall know, <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0042" n="29"/>what it is to
              love without hope! I daily expect orders for restoring Agnes to her Parents.
              Immediately upon her arrival in Spain, She will take the veil, and place an
              insuperable barrier to your union. You may spare your supplications.' She
              continued, perceiving me on the point of speaking; `My resolution is fixed
              and immoveable. Your Mistress shall remain a close Prisoner in her chamber,
              till She exchanges this Castle for the Cloister. Solitude will perhaps
              recall her to a sense of her duty: But to prevent your opposing that wished
              event, I must inform you, Don Alphonso, that your presence here is no longer
              agreeable either to the Baron or Myself. It was not to talk nonsense to my
              Niece, that your Relations sent you to Germany: Your business was to travel,
              and I should be sorry to impede any longer so excellent a design. Farewell,
              Segnor; Remember, that to-morrow morning we meet for the last time.' </p>
            <p>Having said this, She darted upon me a look of pride, contempt, and malice,
              and <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0043" n="30"/>quitted the apartment. I also
              retired to mine, and consumed the night in planning the means of rescuing
              Agnes from the power of her tyrannical Aunt. </p>
            <p>After the positive declaration of its Mistress, it was impossible for me to
              make a longer stay at the Castle of Lindenberg. Accordingly I the next day
              announced my immediate departure. The Baron declared that it gave him
              sincere pain; and He expressed himself in my favour so warmly, that I
              endeavoured to win him over to my interest. Scarcely had I mentioned the
              name of Agnes when He stopped me short, and said, that it was totally out of
              his power to interfere in the business. I saw that it was in vain to argue;
              The Baroness governed her Husband with despotic sway, and I easily
              perceived, that She had prejudiced him against the match. Agnes did not
              appear: I entreated permission to take leave of her, but my prayer was
              rejected. I was obliged to depart without seeing her. </p>
            <p>At quitting him the Baron shook my hand <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0044"
                n="31"/>affectionately, and assured me that as soon as his Niece was gone,
              I might consider his House as my own. </p>
            <p>`Farewell, Don Alphonso!' said the Baroness, and stretched out her hand to
              me. </p>
            <p>I took it, and offered to carry it to my lips. She prevented me. Her
              Husband was at the other end of the room, and out of hearing. </p>
            <p>`Take care of yourself,' She continued; `My love is become hatred, and my
              wounded pride shall not be un-atoned. Go where you will, my vengeance shall
              follow you!' </p>
            <p>She accompanied these words with a look sufficient to make me tremble. I
              answered not, but hastened to quit the Castle. </p>
            <p>As my Chaise drove out of the Court, I looked up to the windows of your
              Sister's chamber. Nobody was to be seen there: I threw myself back
              despondent in my Carriage. I was attended by no other servants than a
              Frenchman whom I had hired <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0045" n="32"/>at
              Strasbourg in Stephano's room, and my little Page whom I before mentioned to
              you. The fidelity, intelligence, and good temper of Theodore had already
              made him dear to me; But He now prepared to lay an obligation on me, which
              made me look upon him as a Guardian Genius. Scarcely had we proceeded half a
              mile from the Castle, when He rode up to the Chaise-door. </p>
            <p>`Take courage, Segnor!' said He in Spanish, which He had already learnt to
              speak with fluency and correctness. `While you were with the Baron, I
              watched the moment when Dame Cunegonda was below stairs, and mounted into
              the chamber over that of Donna Agnes. I sang as loud as I could a little
              German air well-known to her, hoping that She would recollect my voice. I
              was not disappointed, for I soon heard her window open. I hastened to let
              down a string with which I had provided myself: Upon hearing the casement
              closed again, I drew up the string, and fastened to it I found this scrap of
              paper.' </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0046" n="33"/>He then presented me with a small
              note addressed to me. I opened it with impatience: It contained the
              following words written in pencil:</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Conceal yourself for the next fortnight in some neighbouring Village. My
              Aunt will believe you to have quitted Lindenberg, and I shall be restored to
              liberty. I will be in the West Pavilion at twelve on the night of the
              thirtieth. Fail not to be there, and we shall have an opportunity of
              concerting our future plans. Adieu.<lb/>Agnes.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>At perusing these lines my transports exceeded all bounds; Neither did I
              set any to the expressions of gratitude which I heaped upon Theodore. In
              fact his address and attention merited my warmest praise. You will readily
              believe, that I had not entrusted him with my passion for Agnes; But the
              arch Youth had too much discernment not to discover my secret, and too much
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0047" n="34"/>discretion not to conceal his
              knowledge of it. He observed in silence what was going on, nor strove to
              make himself an Agent in the business till my interests required his
              interference. I equally admired his judgment, his penetration, his address,
              and his fidelity. This was not the first occasion in which I had found him
              of infinite use, and I was every day more convinced of his quickness and
              capacity. During my short stay at Strasbourg, He had applied himself
              diligently to learning the rudiments of Spanish: He continued to study it,
              and with so much success that He spoke it with the same facility as his
              native language. He past the greatest part of his time in reading; He had
              acquired much information for his Age; and united the advantages of a lively
              countenance and prepossessing figure to an excellent understanding and the
              very best of hearts. He is now fifteen; He is still in my service, and when
              you see him, I am sure that He will please you. But excuse this digression:
              I return to the subject which I quitted. </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0048" n="35"/>I obeyed the instructions of
              Agnes. I proceeded to Munich. There I left my Chaise under the care of Lucas
              my French Servant, and then returned on Horse-back to a small Village about
              four miles distant from the Castle of Lindenberg. Upon arriving there a
              story was related to the Host at whose Inn I descended, which prevented his
              wondering at my making so long a stay in his House. The old Man fortunately
              was credulous and incurious: He believed all I said, and sought to know no
              more than what I thought proper to tell him. Nobody was with me but
              Theodore; Both were disguised, and as we kept ourselves close, we were not
              suspected to be other than what we seemed. In this manner the fortnight
              passed away. During that time I had the pleasing conviction that Agnes was
              once more at liberty. She past through the Village with Dame Cunegonda: She
              seemed in health and spirits, and talked to her Companion without any
              appearance of constraint. </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0049" n="36"/>`Who are those Ladies?' said I to
              my Host, as the Carriage past. </p>
            <p>`Baron Lindenberg's Niece with her Governess,' He replied; `She goes
              regularly every Friday to the Convent of St. Catharine, in which She was
              brought up, and which is situated about a mile from hence.' </p>
            <p>You may be certain that I waited with impatience for the ensuing Friday. I
              again beheld my lovely Mistress. She cast her eyes upon me, as She passed
              the Inn-door. A blush which overspread her cheek, told me that in spite of
              my disguise I had been recognised. I bowed profoundly. She returned the
              compliment by a slight inclination of the head as if made to one inferior,
              and looked another way till the Carriage was out of sight. </p>
            <p>The long-expected, long-wished for night arrived. It was calm, and the Moon
              was at the full. As soon as the Clock struck eleven I hastened to my
              appointment, determined not to be too late. Theodore had provided a Ladder;
              I ascended the garden wall <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0050" n="37"/>without
              difficulty; The Page followed me, and drew the Ladder after us. I posted
              myself in the West Pavilion, and waited impatiently for the approach of
              Agnes. Every breeze that whispered, every leaf that fell, I believed to be
              her footstep, and hastened to meet her. Thus was I obliged to pass a full
              hour, every minute of which appeared to me an age. The Castle-Bell at length
              tolled twelve, and scarcely could I believe the night to be no further
              advanced. Another quarter of an hour elapsed, and I heard the light foot of
              my Mistress approaching the Pavilion with precaution. I flew to receive her,
              and conducted her to a seat. I threw myself at her feet, and was expressing
              my joy at seeing her, when She thus interrupted me. </p>
            <p>`We have no time to lose, Alphonso: The moments are precious, for though no
              more a Prisoner, Cunegonda watches my every step. An express is arrived from
              my Father; I must depart immediately for Madrid, and 'tis with difficulty
              that I have <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0051" n="38"/>obtained a week's
              delay. The superstition of my Parents, supported by the representations of
              my cruel Aunt, leaves me no hope of softening them to compassion. In this
              dilemma I have resolved to commit myself to your honour: God grant, that you
              may never give me cause to repent my resolution! Flight is my only resource
              from the horrors of a Convent, and my imprudence must be excused by the
              urgency of the danger. Now listen to the plan, by which I hope to effect my
              escape. </p>
            <p>`We are now at the thirtieth of April. On the fifth day from this the
              Visionary Nun is expected to appear. In my last visit to the Convent I
              provided myself with a dress proper for the character: A Friend, whom I have
              left there and to whom I made no scruple to confide my secret, readily
              consented to supply me with a religious habit. Provide a carriage, and be
              with it at a little distance from the great Gate of the Castle. As soon as
              the Clock strikes `one,' I shall quit my chamber, drest in <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0052" n="39"/> the same apparel as the Ghost is
              supposed to wear. Whoever meets me will be too much terrified to oppose my
              escape. I shall easily reach the door, and throw myself under your
              protection. Thus far success is certain: But Oh! Alphonso, should you
              deceive me! Should you despise my imprudence and reward it with ingratitude,
              the World will not hold a Being more wretched than myself! I feel all the
              dangers to which I shall be exposed. I feel, that I am giving you a right to
              treat me with levity: But I rely upon your love, upon your honour! The step,
              which I am on the point of taking, will incense my Relations against me:
              Should you desert me, should you betray the trust reposed in you, I shall
              have no friend to punish your insult, or support my cause. On yourself alone
              rests all my hope, and if your own heart does not plead in my behalf, I am
              undone for ever!' </p>
            <p>The tone in which She pronounced these words was so touching, that in spite
              of my joy at receiving her promise to follow me, I could <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0053" n="40"/>not help being affected. I also
              repined in secret, at not having taken the precaution to provide a Carriage
              at the Village, in which case I might have carried off Agnes that very
              night. Such an attempt was now impracticable: Neither Carriage or Horses
              were to be procured nearer than Munich, which was distant from Lindenberg
              two good days journey. I was therefore obliged to chime in with her plan,
              which in truth seemed well arranged: Her disguise would secure her from
              being stopped in quitting the Castle, and would enable her to step into the
              Carriage at the very Gate without difficulty or losing time. </p>
            <p>Agnes reclined her head mournfully upon my shoulder, and by the light of
              the Moon I saw tears flowing down her cheek. I strove to dissipate her
              melancholy, and encouraged her to look forward to the prospect of happiness.
              I protested in the most solemn terms that her virtue and innocence would be
              safe in my keeping, and that till the church had made her my lawful Wife,
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0054" n="41"/>her honour should be held by me
              as sacred as a Sister's. I told her, that my first care should be to find
              you out, Lorenzo, and reconcile you to our union; and I was continuing to
              speak in the same strain, when a noise without alarmed me. Suddenly the door
              of the Pavilion was thrown open, and Cunegonda stood before us. She had
              heard Agnes steal out of her chamber, followed her into the Garden, and
              perceived her entering the Pavilion. Favoured by the Trees, which shaded it,
              and unperceived by Theodore who waited at a little distance, She had
              approached in silence, and over-heard our whole conversation. </p>
            <p>`Admirable!' cried Cunegonda in a voice shrill with passion, while Agnes
              uttered a loud shriek; `By St. Barbara, young Lady, you have an excellent
              invention! You must personate the Bleeding Nun, truly? What impiety! What
              incredulity! Marry, I have a good mind to let you pursue your plan: When the
              real Ghost met you, I warrant, you would be in a <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0055" n="41"/>pretty condition! Don Alphonso, you
              ought to be ashamed of yourself for seducing a young ignorant Creature to
              leave her family and Friends: However, for this time at least I shall mar
              your wicked designs. The noble Lady shall be informed of the whole affair,
              and Agnes must defer playing the Spectre till a better opportunity.
              Farewell, Segnor-- Donna Agnes, let me have the honour of conducting your
              Ghost-ship back to your apartment.' </p>
            <p>She approached the Sopha on which her trembling Pupil was seated, took her
              by the hand, and prepared to lead her from the Pavilion. </p>
            <p>I detained her, and strove by entreaties, soothing, promises, and flattery
              to win her to my party: But finding all that I could say of no avail, I
              abandoned the vain attempt . </p>
            <p>`Your obstinacy must be its own punishment,' said I; `But one resource
              remains to save Agnes and myself, and I shall not hesitate to employ it.' </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0056" n="43"/>Terrified at this menace, She
              again endeavoured to quit the Pavilion; But I seized her by the wrist, and
              detained her forcibly. At the same moment Theodore, who had followed her
              into the room, closed the door, and prevented her escape. I took the veil of
              Agnes: I threw it round the Duenna's head, who uttered such piercing shrieks
              that in spite of our distance from the Castle, I dreaded their being heard.
              At length I succeeded in gagging her so compleatly, that She could not
              produce a single sound. Theodore and myself with some difficulty next
              contrived to bind her hands and feet with our hand-kerchiefs; And I advised
              Agnes to regain her chamber with all diligence. I promised that no harm
              should happen to Cunegonda, bad her remember that on the fifth of May I
              should be in waiting at the Great Gate of the Castle, and took of her an
              affectionate farewell. Trembling and uneasy She had scarce power enough to
              signify her consent to my plans, <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0057" n="44"
              />and fled back to her apartment in disorder and confusion. </p>
            <p>In the mean-while Theodore assisted me in carrying off my antiquated Prize.
              She was hoisted over the wall, placed before me upon my Horse like a
              Portmanteau, and I galloped away with her from the Castle of Lindenberg. The
              unlucky Duenna never had made a more disagreeable journey in her life: She
              was jolted and shaken till She was become little more than an animated
              Mummy; not to mention her fright, when we waded through a small River,
              through which it was necessary to pass in order to regain the Village.
              Before we reached the Inn, I had already determined how to dispose of the
              troublesome Cunegonda. We entered the Street in which the Inn stood, and
              while the page knocked, I waited at a little distance. The Landlord opened
              the door with a Lamp in his hand. </p>
            <p>`Give me the light!' said Theodore; `My Master is coming.' </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0058" n="45"/>He snatched the Lamp hastily, and
              purposely let it fall upon the ground: The Landlord returned to the Kitchen
              to re-light the Lamp, leaving the door open. I profited by the obscurity,
              sprang from my Horse with Cunegonda in my arms, darted up stairs, reached my
              chamber unperceived, and unlocking the door of a spacious Closet, stowed her
              within it, and then turned the Key. The Landlord and Theodore soon after
              appeared with lights: The Former expressed himself a little surprised at my
              returning so late, but asked no impertinent questions. He soon quitted the
              room, and left me to exult in the success of my undertaking. </p>
            <p>I immediately paid a visit to my Prisoner. I strove to persuade her
              submitting with patience to her temporary confinement. My attempt was
              unsuccessful. Unable to speak or move, She expressed her fury by her looks,
              and except at meals I never dared to unbind her, or release her from the
              Gag. At such times I stood over her with a drawn sword, and protested, that
              if She uttered a <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0059" n="46"/>single cry, I
              would plunge it in her bosom. As soon as She had done eating, the Gag was
              replaced. I was conscious, that this proceeding was cruel, and could only be
              justified by the urgency of circumstances: As to Theodore, He had no
              scruples upon the subject. Cunegonda's captivity entertained him beyond
              measure. During his abode in the Castle, a continual warfare had been
              carried on between him and the Duenna; and now that He found his Enemy so
              absolutely in his power, He triumphed without mercy. He seemed to think of
              nothing but how to find out new means of plaguing her: Sometimes He affected
              to pity her misfortune, then laughed at, abused, and mimicked her; He played
              her a thousand tricks, each more provoking than the other, and amused
              himself by telling her, that her elopement must have occasioned much
              surprise at the Baron's. This was in fact the case. No one except Agnes
              could imagine what was become of Dame Cunegonda: Every hole and corner was
              searched for her; <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0060" n="47"/>The Ponds were
              dragged, and the Woods underwent a thorough examination. Still no Dame
              Cunegonda made her appearance. Agnes kept the secret, and I kept the Duenna:
              The Baroness, therefore, remained in total ignorance respecting the old
              Woman's fate, but suspected her to have perished by suicide. Thus past away
              five days, during which I had prepared every thing necessary for my
              enterprise. On quitting Agnes, I had made it my first business to dispatch a
              Peasant with a letter to Lucas at Munich, ordering him to take care that a
              Coach and four should arrive about ten o'clock on the fifth of May at the
              Village of Rosenwald. He obeyed my instructions punctually: The Equipage
              arrived at the time appointed. As the period of her Lady's elopement drew
              nearer, Cunegonda's rage increased. I verily believe that spight and passion
              would have killed her, had I not luckily discovered her prepossession in
              favour of Cherry-Brandy. With this favourite liquor She was plentifully
              supplied, and Theodore always <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0061" n="48"
              />remaining to guard her, the Gag was occasionally removed. The liquor
              seemed to have a wonderful effect in softening the acrimony of her nature;
              and her confinement not admitting of any other amusement, She got drunk
              regularly once a day just by way of passing the time. </p>
            <p>The fifth of May arrived, a period by me never to be forgotten! Before the
              Clock struck twelve, I betook myself to the scene of action. Theodore
              followed me on horse-back. I concealed the Carriage in a spacious Cavern of
              the Hill, on whose brow the Castle was situated: This Cavern was of
              considerable depth, and among the peasants was known by the name of
              Lindenberg Hole. The night was calm and beautiful: The Moonbeams fell upon
              the antient Towers of the Castle, and shed upon their summits a silver
              light. All was still around me: Nothing was to be heard except the night-
              breeze sighing among the leaves, the distant barking of Village Dogs, or the
              Owl who had established herself in a nook of the deserted Eastern Turret. I
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0062" n="49"/>heard her melancholy shriek, and
              looked upwards. She sat upon the ride of a window, which I recognized to be
              that of the haunted Room. This brought to my remembrance the story of the
              Bleeding Nun, and I sighed while I reflected on the influence of
              superstition and weakness of human reason. Suddenly I heard a faint chorus
              steal upon the silence of the night. </p>
            <p>`What can occasion that noise, Theodore?' </p>
            <p>`A Stranger of distinction,' replied He, `passed through the Village to-day
              in his way to the Castle: He is reported to be the Father of Donna Agnes.
              Doubtless, the Baron has given an entertainment to celebrate his arrival.' </p>
            <p>The Castle-Bell announced the hour of midnight: This was the usual signal
              for the family to retire to Bed. Soon after I perceived lights in the Castle
              moving backwards and forwards in different directions. I conjectured the
              company to be separating. I could hear the heavy doors grate as they <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0063" n="50"/>opened with difficulty, and as they
              closed again the rotten Casements rattled in their frames. The chamber of
              Agnes was on the other side of the Castle. I trembled, lest She should have
              failed in obtaining the Key of the haunted Room: Through this it was
              necessary for her to pass, in order to reach the narrow Stair-case by which
              the Ghost was supposed to descend into the great Hall. Agitated by this
              apprehension, I kept my eyes constantly fixed upon the window, where I hoped
              to perceive the friendly glare of a Lamp borne by Agnes. I now heard the
              massy Gates unbarred. By the candle in his hand I distinguished old Conrad,
              the Porter. He set the Portal-doors wide open, and retired. The lights in
              the Castle gradually disappeared, and at length the whole Building was wrapt
              in darkness. </p>
            <p>While I sat upon a broken ridge of the Hill, the stillness of the scene
              inspired me with melancholy ideas not altogether unpleasing. The Castle
              which stood full in my sight, formed an object equally awful <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0064" n="51"/>and picturesque. Its ponderous Walls
              tinged by the moon with solemn brightness, its old and partly-ruined Towers
              lifting themselves into the clouds and seeming to frown on the plains around
              them, its lofty battlements o&euml;rgrown with ivy, and folding Gates
              expanding in honour of the Visionary Inhabitant, made me sensible of a sad
              and reverential horror. Yet did not these sensations occupy me so fully, as
              to prevent me from witnessing with impatience the slow progress of time. I
              approached the Castle, and ventured to walk round it. A few rays of light
              still glimmered in the chamber of Agnes. I observed them with joy. I was
              still gazing upon them, when I perceived a figure draw near the window, and
              the Curtain was carefully closed to conceal the Lamp which burned there.
              Convinced by this observation that Agnes had not abandoned our plan, I
              returned with a light heart to my former station. </p>
            <p>The half-hour struck! The three-quarters struck! My bosom beat high <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0065" n="52"/>with hope and expectation. At length
              the wished-for sound was heard. The Bell tolled `One,' and the Mansion
              echoed with the noise loud and solemn. I looked up to the Casement of the
              haunted Chamber. Scarcely had five minutes elapsed, when the expected light
              appeared. I was now close to the Tower. The window was not so far from the
              Ground, but that I fancied I perceived a female figure with a Lamp in her
              hand moving slowly along the Apartment. The light soon faded away, and all
              was again dark and gloomy. </p>
            <p>Occasional gleams of brightness darted from the Staircase windows, as the
              lovely Ghost past by them. I traced the light through the Hall: It reached
              the Portal, and at length I beheld Agnes pass through the folding- gates.
              She was habited exactly as She had described the Spectre. A chaplet of Beads
              hung upon her arm; her head was enveloped in a long white veil; Her Nun's
              dress was stained with blood, and She had taken care to provide herself with
              a Lamp and <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0066" n="53"/>dagger. She advanced
              towards the spot where I stood. I flew to meet her, and clasped her in my
              arms.</p>

            <p>Terrified and breathless She was unable to speak: She dropt her Lamp and
              dagger, and sank upon my bosom in silence. I raised her in my arms, and
              conveyed her to the Carriage. Theodore remained behind in order to release
              Dame Cunegonda. I also charged him with a letter to the Baroness explaining
              the whole affair, and entreating her good offices in reconciling Don Gaston
              to my union with his Daughter. I discovered to her my real name: I proved to
              her that my birth and expectations justified my pretending to her Niece, and
              assured her, <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0067" n="54"/>though it was out of
              my power to return her love, that I would strive unceasingly to obtain her
              esteem and friendship. </p>
            <p>I stepped into the Carriage, where Agnes was already seated. Theodore
              closed the door, and the Postillions drove away. At first I was delighted
              with the rapidity of our progress; But as soon as we were in no danger of
              pursuit, I called to the Drivers, and bad them moderate their pace. They
              strove in vain to obey me. The Horses refused to answer the rein, and
              continued to rush on with astonishing swiftness. The Postillions redoubled
              their efforts to stop them, but by kicking and plunging the Beasts soon
              released themselves from this restraint. Uttering a loud shriek, the Drivers
              were hurled upon the ground. Immediately thick clouds obscured the sky: The
              winds howled around us, the lightning flashed, and the Thunder roared
              tremendously. Never did I behold so frightful a Tempest! Terrified by the
              jar of contending elements, the Horses seemed every moment <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0068" n="55"/>to increase their speed. Nothing
              could interrupt their career; They dragged the Carriage through Hedges and
              Ditches, dashed down the most dangerous precipices, and seemed to vye in
              swiftness with the rapidity of the winds. </p>
            <p>All this while my Companion lay motionless in my arms. Truly alarmed by the
              magnitude of the danger, I was in vain attempting to recall her to her
              senses; when a loud crash announced, that a stop was put to our progress in
              the most disagreeable manner. The Carriage was shattered to pieces. In
              falling I struck my temple against a flint. The pain of the wound, the
              violence of the shock, and apprehension for the safety of Agnes combined to
              over-power me so compleatly, that my senses forsook me, and I lay without
              animation on the ground. </p>
            <p>I probably remained for some time in this situation, since when I opened my
              eyes, it was broad day-light. Several Peasants were standing round me, and
              seemed disputing whether my recovery was possible. I <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0069" n="56"/>spoke German tolerably well. As soon
              as I could utter an articulate sound, I enquired after Agnes. What was my
              surprise and distress, when assured by the Peasants, that nobody had been
              seen answering the description which I gave of her! They told me, that in
              going to their daily labour they had been alarmed by observing the fragments
              of my Carriage, and by hearing the groans of an Horse, the only one of the
              four which remained alive: The other Three lay dead by my side. Nobody was
              near me when they came up, and much time had been lost, before they
              succeeded in recovering me. Uneasy beyond expression respecting the fate of
              my Companion, I besought the Peasants to disperse themselves in search of
              her: I described her dress, and promised immense rewards to whoever brought
              me any intelligence. As for myself, it was impossible for me to join in the
              pursuit: I had broken two of my ribs in the fall: My arm being dislocated
              hung useless by my side; and my left leg was <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0070" n="57"/> shattered so terribly, that I never
              expected to recover its use. </p>
            <p>The Peasants complied with my request: All left me except Four, who made a
              litter of boughs, and prepared to convey me to the neighbouring Town. I
              enquired its name. It proved to be Ratisbon, and I could scarcely persuade
              myself that I had travelled to such a distance in a single night. I told the
              Countrymen, that at one o'clock that morning I had past through the Village
              of Rosenwald. They shook their heads wistfully, and made signs to each
              other, that I must certainly be delirious. I was conveyed to a decent Inn,
              and immediately put to bed. A Physician was sent for, who set my arm with
              success. He then examined my other hurts, and told me that I need be under
              no apprehension of the consequences of any of them; But ordered me to keep
              myself quiet, and be prepared for a tedious and painful cure. I answered
              him, that if He hoped to keep me quiet, He must first endeavour to procure
              me some news of a <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0071" n="58"/>Lady, who had
              quitted Rosenwald in my company the night before, and had been with me at
              the moment when the Coach broke down. He smiled, and only replied by
              advising me to make myself easy, for that all proper care should be taken of
              me. As He quitted me, the Hostess met him at the door of the room. </p>
            <p>`The Gentleman is not quite in his right senses;' I heard him say to her in
              a low voice; ` 'Tis the natural consequence of his fall, but that will soon
              be over.' </p>
            <p>One after another the Peasants returned to the Inn, and informed me that no
              traces had been discovered of my unfortunate Mistress. Uneasiness now became
              despair. I entreated them to renew their search in the most urgent terms,
              doubling the promises which I had already made them. My wild and frantic
              manner confirmed the bye-standers in the idea of my being delirious. No
              signs of the Lady having appeared, they believed her to be a creature
              fabricated by my over-heated brain, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0072"
                n="59"/>paid no attention to my entreaties. However, the Hostess assured
              me that a fresh enquiry should be made, but I found afterwards that her
              promise was only given to quiet me. No further steps were taken in the
              business. </p>
            <p>Though my Baggage was left at Munich under the care of my French Servant,
              having prepared myself for a long journey, my purse was amply furnished:
              Besides my equipage proved me to be of distinction, and in consequence all
              possible attention was paid me at the Inn. The day passed away: Still no
              news arrived of Agnes. The anxiety of fear now gave place to despondency. I
              ceased to rave about her, and was plunged in the depth of melancholy
              reflections. Perceiving me to be silent and tranquil, my Attendants believed
              my delirium to have abated, and that my malady had taken a favourable turn.
              According to the Physician's order I swallowed a composing medicine; and as
              soon as the night <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0073" n="60"/>shut in, my
              attendants withdrew, and left me to repose. </p>
            <p>That repose I wooed in vain. The agitation of my bosom chased away sleep.
              Restless in my mind, in spite of the fatigue of my body I continued to toss
              about from side to side, till the Clock in a neighbouring Steeple struck
              `One.' As I listened to the mournful hollow sound, and heard it die away in
              the wind, I felt a sudden chillness spread itself over my body. I shuddered
              without knowing wherefore; Cold dews poured down my forehead, and my hair
              stood bristling with alarm. Suddenly I heard slow and heavy steps ascending
              the stair-case. By an involuntary movement I started up in my bed, and drew
              back the curtain. A single rush-light, which glimmered upon the hearth shed
              a faint gleam through the apartment, which was hung with tapestry. The door
              was thrown open with violence. A figure entered, and drew near my Bed with
              solemn measured steps. <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0074" n="61"/>With
              trembling apprehension I examined this midnight Visitor. God Almighty! It
              was the Bleeding Nun! It was my lost Companion! Her face was still veiled,
              but She no longer held her Lamp and dagger. She lifted up her veil slowly.
              What a sight presented itself to my startled eyes! I beheld before me an
              animated Corse. Her countenance was long and haggard; Her cheeks and lips
              were bloodless; The paleness of death was spread over her features, and her
              eye-balls fixed stedfastly upon me were lustreless and hollow. </p>
            <p>I gazed upon the Spectre with horror too great to be described. My blood
              was frozen in my veins. I would have called for aid, but the sound expired,
              ere it could pass my lips. My nerves were bound up in impotence, and I
              remained in the same attitude inanimate as a Statue. </p>
            <p>The visionary Nun looked upon me for some minutes in silence: There was
              something petrifying in her regard. At length <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0075" n="62"/>in a low sepulchral voice She
              pronounced the following words.</p>

            <lg type="stanza">
              <l>"<hi rend="italic">Raymond! Raymond! Thou art mine!</hi></l>
              <l>
                <hi rend="italic">Raymond! Raymond! I am thine!</hi>
              </l>
              <l>
                <hi rend="italic">In thy veins while blood shall roll,</hi>
              </l>
              <l>
                <hi rend="italic">I am thine!</hi>
              </l>
              <l>
                <hi rend="italic">Thou art mine!</hi>
              </l>
              <l><hi rend="italic">Mine thy body! Mine thy soul!</hi>----''</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Breathless with fear, I listened while She repeated my own expressions. The
              Apparition seated herself opposite to me at the foot of the Bed, and was
              silent. Her eyes were fixed earnestly upon mine: They seemed endowed with
              the property of the Rattle-snake's, for I strove in vain to look off her. My
              eyes were fascinated, and I had not the power of withdrawing them from the
              Spectre's. </p>
            <p>In this attitude She remained for a whole long hour without speaking or
              moving; nor was I able to do either. At length the Clock struck two. The
              Apparition rose from her seat, and approached the side of the bed. She
              grasped with her icy fingers <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0076" n="63"/>my
              hand which hung lifeless upon the Coverture, and pressing her cold lips to
              mine, again repeated,</p>
            <lg type="stanza">
              <l>"<hi rend="italic">Raymond! Raymond! Thou art mine!</hi></l>
              <l><hi rend="italic">Raymond! Raymond! I am thine!
                &amp;c</hi>.----''</l>
            </lg>
            <p>She then dropped my hand, quitted the chamber with slow steps, and the Door
              closed after her. Till that moment the faculties of my body had been all
              suspended; Those of my mind had alone been waking. The charm now ceased to
              operate: The blood which had been frozen in my veins rushed back to my heart
              with violence: I uttered a deep groan, and sank lifeless upon my pillow. </p>
            <p>The adjoining room was only separated from mine by a thin partition: It was
              occupied by the Host and his Wife: The Former was rouzed by my groan, and
              immediately hastened to my chamber: The Hostess soon followed him. With some
              difficulty they succeeded in restoring me to my senses, and immediately sent
              for the Physician, who arrived in all diligence. He declared <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0077" n="64"/> my fever to be very much increased,
              and that if I continued to suffer such violent agitation, He would not take
              upon him to ensure my life. Some medicines which He gave me, in some degree
              tranquillized my spirits. I fell into a sort of slumber towards day-break;
              But fearful dreams prevented me from deriving any benefit from my repose.
              Agnes and the Bleeding Nun presented themselves by turns to my fancy, and
              combined to harass and torment me. I awoke fatigued and unrefreshed. My
              fever seemed rather augmented than diminished; The agitation of my mind
              impeded my fractured bones from knitting: I had frequent fainting fits, and
              during the whole day the Physician judged it expedient not to quit me for
              two hours together. </p>
            <p>The singularity of my adventure made me determine to conceal it from every
              one, since I could not expect that a circumstance so strange should gain
              credit. I was very uneasy about Agnes. I knew not what She would think at
              not finding me at the <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0078" n="65"/>rendez-vous,
              and dreaded her entertaining suspicions of my fidelity. However, I depended
              upon Theodore's discretion, and trusted, that my letter to the Baroness
              would convince her of the rectitude of my intentions. These considerations
              somewhat lightened my inquietude upon her account: But the impression left
              upon my mind by my nocturnal Visitor, grew stronger with every succeeding
              moment. The night drew near; I dreaded its arrival. Yet I strove to persuade
              myself that the Ghost would appear no more, and at all events I desired,
              that a Servant might sit up in my chamber. </p>
            <p>The fatigue of my body from not having slept on the former night
              co-operating with the strong opiates administered to me in profusion at
              length procured me that repose of which I was so much in need. I sank into a
              profound and tranquil slumber, and had already slept for some hours, when
              the neighbouring Clock rouzed me by striking `One'. Its sound brought with
              it to my memory all the horrors of the night <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0079" n="66"/>before. The same cold shivering
              seized me. I started up in my bed, and perceived the Servant fast asleep in
              an armed-Chair near me. I called him by his name: He made no answer. I shook
              him forcibly by the arm, and strove in vain to wake him. He was perfectly
              insensible to my efforts. I now heard the heavy steps ascending the
              stair-case; The Door was thrown open, and again the Bleeding Nun stood
              before me. Once more my limbs were chained in second infancy. Once more I
              heard those fatal words repeated,</p>
            <lg type="stanza">
              <l>"<hi rend="italic">Raymond! Raymond! Thou art mine!</hi></l>
              <l><hi rend="italic">Raymond! Raymond! I am thine!
                &amp;c</hi>.----''</l>
            </lg>

            <p>The scene which had shocked me so sensibly on the former night, was again
              presented. The Spectre again pressed her lips to mine, again touched me with
              her rotting fingers, and as on her first appearance, quitted the chamber as
              soon as the Clock told `Two.' </p>
            <p>Even night was this repeated. Far from growing accustomed to the Ghost, <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0080" n="67"/>every succeeding visit inspired me
              with greater horror. Her idea pursued me continually, and I became the prey
              of habitual melancholy. The constant agitation of my mind naturally retarded
              the re-establishment of my health. Several months elapsed before I was able
              to quit my bed; and when at length I was moved to a Sopha, I was so faint,
              spiritless, and emaciated, that I could not cross the room without
              assistance. The looks of my Attendants sufficiently denoted the little hope,
              which they entertained of my recovery. The profound sadness, which oppressed
              me without remission made the Physician consider me to be an Hypochondriac.
              The cause of my distress I carefully concealed in my own bosom, for I knew
              that no one could give me relief: The Ghost was not even visible to any eye
              but mine. I had frequently caused Attendants to sit up in my room: But the
              moment that the Clock struck `One,' irresistible slumber seized them, nor
              left them till the departure of the Ghost. </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0081" n="68"/>You may be surprized, that during
              this time I made no enquiries after your Sister. Theodore, who with
              difficulty had discovered my abode, had quieted my apprehensions for her
              safety: At the same time He convinced me, that all attempts to release her
              from captivity must be fruitless, till I should be in a condition to return
              to Spain. The particulars of her adventure which I shall now relate to you,
              were partly communicated to me by Theodore, and partly by Agnes herself. </p>
            <p>On the fatal night when her elopement was to have taken place, accident had
              not permitted her to quit her chamber at the appointed time. At length She
              ventured into the haunted room, descended the stair-case leading into the
              Hall, found the Gates open as She expected, and left the Castle unobserved.
              What was her surprize at not finding me ready to receive her! She examined
              the Cavern, ranged through every Alley of the neighbouring wood, and passed
              two full hours in this fruitless enquiry. She <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0082" n="69"/>could discover no traces either of me
              or of the Carriage. Alarmed and disappointed, her only resource was to
              return to the Castle before the Baroness missed her: But here She found
              herself in a fresh embarrassment. The Bell had already tolled `Two:' The
              Ghostly hour was past, and the careful Porter had locked the folding gates.
              After much irresolution She ventured to knock softly. Luckily for her Conrad
              was still awake: He heard the noise, and rose, murmuring at being called up
              a second time. No sooner had He opened one of the Doors, and beheld the
              supposed Apparition waiting there for admittance, than He uttered a loud
              cry, and sank upon his knees. Agnes profited by his terror. She glided by
              him, flew to her own apartment, and having thrown off her Spectre's
              trappings, retired to bed endeavouring in vain to account for my
              disappearing. </p>
            <p>In the mean while Theodore having seen my Carriage drive off with the false
              Agnes, returned joyfully to the Village. <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0083"
                n="70"/>The next morning He released Cunegonda from her confinement, and
              accompanied her to the Castle. There He found the Baron, his Lady, and Don
              Gaston, disputing together upon the Porter's relation. All of them agreed in
              believing the existence of Spectres: But the Latter contended, that for a
              Ghost to knock for admittance was a proceeding till then unwitnessed, and
              totally incompatible with the immaterial nature of a Spirit. They were still
              discussing this subject, when the Page appeared with Cunegonda, and cleared
              up the mystery. On hearing his deposition, it was agreed unanimously that
              the Agnes whom Theodore had seen step into my Carriage must have been the
              Bleeding Nun, and that the Ghost who had terrified Conrad was no other than
              Don Gaston's Daughter. </p>
            <p>The first surprize which this discovery occasioned being over, the Baroness
              resolved to make it of use in persuading her Niece to take the veil. Fearing
              lest so advantageous an establishment for his Daughter <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0084" n="71"/>should induce Don Gaston to renounce
              his resolution, She suppressed my letter, and continued to represent me as a
              needy unknown Adventurer. A childish vanity had led me to conceal my real
              name even from my Mistress; I wished to be loved for myself, not for being
              the Son and Heir of the Marquis de las Cisternas. The consequence was, that
              my rank was known to no one in the Castle except the Baroness, and She took
              good care to confine the knowledge to her own breast. Don Gaston having
              approved his Sister's design, Agnes was summoned to appear before them. She
              was taxed with having meditated an elopement, obliged to make a full
              confession, and was amazed at the gentleness with which it was received: But
              what was her affliction, when informed that the failure of her project must
              be attributed to me! Cunegonda, tutored by the Baroness, told her that when
              I released her, I had desired her to inform her Lady that our connexion was
              at an end, that the whole affair was <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0085" n="72"
              /> occasioned by a false report, and that it by no means suited my
              circumstances to marry a Woman without fortune or expectations. </p>
            <p>To this account my sudden disappearing gave but too great an air of
              probability. Theodore, who could have contradicted the story, by Donna
              Rodolpha's order was kept out of her sight: What proved a still greater
              confirmation of my being an Impostor, was the arrival of a letter from
              yourself declaring, that you had no sort of acquaintance with Alphonso
              d'Alvarada. These seeming proofs of my perfidy, aided by the artful
              insinuations of her Aunt, by Cunegonda's flattery, and her Father's threats
              and anger, entirely conquered your Sister's repugnance to a Convent.
              Incensed at my behaviour, and disgusted with the world in general, She
              consented to receive the veil. She past another Month at the Castle of
              Lindenberg, during which my non-appearance confirmed her in her resolution,
              and then accompanied Don Gaston into Spain. Theodore was now set at liberty.
              He <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0086" n="73"/>hastened to Munich, where I had
              promised to let him hear from me; But finding from Lucas that I had never
              arrived there, He pursued his search with indefatigable perseverance, and at
              length succeeded in rejoining me at Ratisbon. </p>
            <p>So much was I altered, that scarcely could He recollect my features: The
              distress visible upon his sufficiently testified how lively was the interest
              which He felt for me. The society of this amiable Boy, whom I had always
              considered rather as a Companion than a Servant, was now my only comfort.
              His conversation was gay yet sensible, and his observations shrewd and
              entertaining: He had picked up much more knowledge than is usual at his Age:
              But what rendered him most agreeable to me, was his having a delightful
              voice, and some skill in Music. He had also acquired some taste in poetry,
              and even ventured sometimes to write verses himself. He occasionally
              composed little Ballads in Spanish, his compositions were but indifferent, I
              must confess; yet they were <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0087" n="74"
              />pleasing to me from their novelty, and hearing him sing them to his guitar
              was the only amusement, which I was capable of receiving. Theodore perceived
              well enough that something preyed upon my mind; But as I concealed the cause
              of my grief even from him, Respect would not permit him to pry into my
              secrets. </p>
            <p>One Evening I was lying upon my Sopha, plunged in reflections very far from
              agreeable: Theodore amused himself by observing from the window a Battle
              between two Postillions, who were quarrelling in the Inn-yard. </p>
            <p>`Ha! Ha!' cried He suddenly; `Yonder is the Great Mogul.' </p>
            <p>`Who?' said I. </p>
            <p>`Only a Man, who made me a strange speech at Munich.' </p>
            <p>`What was the purport of it?' </p>
            <p>`Now you put me in mind of it, Segnor, it was a kind of message to you; but
              truly it was not worth delivering. I believe the Fellow to be mad for my
              part. When I came to Munich in search of you, <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0088" n="75"/>I found him living at `The King of
              the Romans,' and the Host gave me an odd account of him. By his accent He is
              supposed to be a Foreigner, but of what Country nobody can tell. He seemed
              to have no acquaintance in the Town, spoke very seldom, and never was seen
              to smile. He had neither Servants or Baggage; But his Purse seemed well-
              furnished, and He did much good in the Town. Some supposed him to be an
              Arabian Astrologer, Others to be a Travelling Mountebank, and many declared
              that He was Doctor Faustus, whom the Devil had sent back to Germany. The
              Landlord, however told me, that He had the best reasons to believe him to be
              the Great Mogul incognito.' </p>
            <p>`But the strange speech, Theodore.' </p>
            <p>`True, I had almost forgotten the speech: Indeed for that matter, it would
              not have been a great loss, if I had forgotten it altogether. You are to
              know, Segnor, that while I was enquiring about you of the Landlord, this
              Stranger passed by. He <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0089" n="76"/>stopped, and
              looked at me earnestly. `Youth!' said He in a solemn voice, `He whom you
              seek, has found that, which He would fain lose. My hand alone can dry up the
              blood: Bid your Master wish for me, when the Clock strikes, `One.' </p>
            <p>`How?' cried I, starting from my Sopha. [The words which Theodore had
              repeated, seemed to imply the Stranger's knowledge of my secret] `Fly to
              him, my Boy! Entreat him to grant me one moment's conversation!' </p>
            <p>Theodore was surprised at the vivacity of my manner: However, He asked no
              questions, but hastened to obey me. I waited his return impatiently. But a
              short space of time had elapsed when He again appeared, and ushered the
              expected Guest into my chamber. He was a Man of majestic presence: His
              countenance was strongly marked, and his eyes were large, black, and
              sparkling: Yet there was a something in his look, which the moment that I
              saw him, inspired me with a secret awe, not to <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0090" n="77"/>say horror. He was drest plainly, his
              hair was unpowdered, and a band of black velvet which encircled his
              fore-head, spread over his features an additional gloom. His countenance
              wore the marks of profound melancholy; his step was slow, and his manner
              grave, stately, and solemn. </p>
            <p>He saluted me with politeness; and having replied to the usual compliments
              of introduction, He motioned to Theodore to quit the chamber. The Page
              instantly with-drew. </p>
            <p>`I know your business,' said He, without giving me time to speak. `I have
              the power of releasing you from your nightly Visitor; But this cannot be
              done before Sunday. On the hour when the Sabbath Morning breaks, Spirits of
              darkness have least influence over Mortals. After Saturday the Nun shall
              visit you no more.' </p>
            <p>`May I not enquire,' said I, `by what means you are in possession of a
              secret, which I have carefully concealed from the knowledge of every one?' </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0091" n="78"/>`How can I be ignorant of your
              distress, when their cause at this moment stands beside you?' </p>
            <p>I started. The Stranger continued. </p>
            <p>`Though to you only visible for one hour in the twenty-four, neither day or
              night does She ever quit you; Nor will She ever quit you till you have
              granted her request.' </p>
            <p>`And what is that request?' </p>
            <p>`That She must herself explain: It lies not in my knowledge. Wait with
              patience for the night of Saturday: All shall be then cleared up.' </p>
            <p>I dared not press him further. He soon after changed the conversation, and
              talked of various matters. He named People who had ceased to exist for many
              Centuries, and yet with whom He appeared to have been personally acquainted.
              I could not mention a Country however distant which He had not visited, nor
              could I sufficiently admire the extent, and variety of his information. I
              remarked to him that having <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0092" n="79"
              />travelled, seen, and known so much, must have given him infinite pleasure.
              He shook his head mournfully. </p>
            <p>`No one,' He replied, `is adequate to comprehending the misery of my lot!
              Fate obliges me to be constantly in movement: I am not permitted to pass
              more than a fortnight in the same place. I have no Friend in the world, and
              from the restlessness of my destiny I never can acquire one. Fain would I
              lay down my miserable life, for I envy those who enjoy the quiet of the
              Grave: But Death eludes me, and flies from my embrace. In vain do I throw
              myself in the way of danger. I plunge into the Ocean; The Waves throw me
              back with abhorrence upon the shore: I rush into fire; The flames recoil at
              my approach: I oppose myself to the fury of Banditti; Their swords become
              blunted, and break against my breast: The hungry Tiger shudders at my
              approach, and the Alligator flies from a Monster more horrible than itself.
              God <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0093" n="80"/>has set his seal upon me, and
              all his Creatures respect this fatal mark!' </p>
            <p>He put his hand to the velvet, which was bound round his fore-head. There
              was in his eyes an expression of fury, despair, and malevolence, that struck
              horror to my very soul. An involuntary convulsion made me shudder. The
              Stranger perceived it. </p>
            <p>`Such is the curse imposed on me,' he continued: `I am doomed to inspire
              all who look on me with terror and detestation. You already feel the
              influence of the charm, and with every succeeding moment will feel it more.
              I will not add to your sufferings by my presence. Farewell till Saturday. As
              soon as the Clock strikes twelve, expect me at your chamber-door.' </p>
            <p>Having said this He departed, leaving me in astonishment at the mysterious
              turn of his manner and conversation. </p>
            <p>His assurances that I should soon be relieved from the Apparition's visits,
              produced a good effect upon my constitution. Theodore, <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0094" n="81"/>whom I rather treated as an adopted
              Child than a Domestic, was surprized at his return to observe the amendment
              in my looks. He congratulated me on this symptom of returning health, and
              declared himself delighted at my having received so much benefit from my
              conference with the Great Mogul. Upon enquiry I found that the Stranger had
              already past eight days in Ratisbon: According to his own account,
              therefore, He was only to remain there six days longer. Saturday was still
              at the distance of Three. Oh! with what impatience did I expect its arrival!
              In the interim, the Bleeding Nun continued her nocturnal visits; But hoping
              soon to be released from them altogether, the effects which they produced on
              me became less violent than before. </p>
            <p>The wished-for night arrived. To avoid creating suspicion I retired to bed
              at my usual hour: But as soon as my Attendants had left me, I dressed myself
              again, and prepared for the Stranger's reception. He <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0095" n="82"/>entered my room upon the turn of
              midnight. A small Chest was in his hand, which He placed near the Stove. He
              saluted me without speaking; I returned the compliment, observing an equal
              silence. He then opened his Chest. The first thing which He produced, was a
              small wooden Crucifix: He sank upon his knees, gazed upon it mournfully, and
              cast his eyes towards heaven. He seemed to be praying devoutly. At length He
              bowed his head respectfully, kissed the Crucifix thrice, and quitted his
              kneeling posture. He next drew from the Chest a covered Goblet: With the
              liquor which it contained, and which appeared to be blood, He sprinkled the
              floor, and then dipping in it one end of the Crucifix, He described a circle
              in the middle of the room. Round about this He placed various reliques,
              sculls, thigh-bones &amp;c; I observed, that He disposed them all in the
              forms of Crosses. Lastly He took out a large Bible, and beckoned me to
              follow him into the Circle. I obeyed. </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0096" n="83"/>`Be cautious not to utter a
              syllable!' whispered the Stranger; `Step not out of the circle, and as you
              love yourself, dare not to look upon my face!' </p>
            <p>Holding the Crucifix in one hand, the Bible in the other, He seemed to read
              with profound attention. The Clock struck `One'! As usual I heard the
              Spectre's steps upon the Stair-case: But I was not seized with the
              accustomed shivering. I waited her approach with confidence. She entered the
              room, drew near the Circle, and stopped. The Stranger muttered some words,
              to me unintelligible. Then raising his head from the Book, and extending the
              Crucifix towards the Ghost, He pronounced in a voice distinct and solemn, </p>
            <p>`Beatrice! Beatrice! Beatrice!' </p>
            <p>`What wouldst Thou?' replied the Apparition in a hollow faltering tone. </p>
            <p>`What disturbs thy sleep? Why dost thou afflict and torture this Youth? How
              can rest be restored to thy unquiet Spirit?' </p>
            <p>`I dare not tell!--I must not tell!--Fain <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0097"
                n="84"/>would I repose in my Grave, but stern commands force me to prolong
              my punishment!' </p>
            <p>`Knowest Thou this blood? Knowest Thou in whose veins it flowed? Beatrice!
              Beatrice! In his name I charge thee to answer me!' </p>
            <p>`I dare not disobey my taskers.' </p>
            <p>`Darest Thou disobey Me?' </p>
            <p>He spoke in a commanding tone, and drew the sable band from his fore-head.
              In spite of his injunctions to the contrary, Curiosity would not suffer me
              to keep my eyes off his face: I raised them, and beheld a burning Cross
              impressed upon his brow. For the horror with which this object inspired me I
              cannot account, but I never felt its equal! My senses left me for some
              moments; A mysterious dread overcame my courage, and had not the Exorciser
              caught my hand, I should have fallen out of the Circle. </p>
            <p>When I recovered myself, I perceived that the burning Cross had produced an
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0098" n="85"/>effect no less violent upon the
              Spectre. Her countenance expressed reverence, and horror, and her visionary
              limbs were shaken by fear. </p>
            <p>`Yes!' She said at length; `I tremble at that mark!-- respect it!--I obey
              you! Know then, that my bones lie still unburied: They rot in the obscurity
              of Lindenberg Hole. None but this Youth has the right of consigning them to
              the Grave. His own lips have made over to me his body and his soul: Never
              will I give back his promise, never shall He know a night devoid of terror,
              unless He engages to collect my mouldering bones, and deposit them in the
              family vault of his Andalusian Castle. Then let thirty Masses be said for
              the repose of my Spirit, and I trouble this world no more. Now let me
              depart! Those flames are scorching!' </p>
            <p>He let the hand drop slowly which held the Crucifix, and which till then He
              had pointed towards her. The apparition bowed her head, and her form melted
              into <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0099" n="86"/> air. The Exorciser led me out
              of the Circle. He replaced the Bible &amp;c. in the Chest, and then
              addressed himself to me, who stood near him speechless from astonishment. </p>
            <p>`Don Raymond, you have heard the conditions on which repose is promised
              you. Be it your business to fulfil them to the letter. For me nothing more
              remains than to clear up the darkness still spread over the Spectre's
              History, and inform you that when living Beatrice bore the name of las
              Cisternas. She was the great Aunt of your Grand-father: In quality of your
              relation, her ashes demand respect from you, though the enormity of her
              crimes must excite your abhorrence. The nature of those crimes no one is
              more capable of explaining to you than myself: I was personally acquainted
              with the holy Man who proscribed her nocturnal riots in the Castle of
              Lindenberg, and I hold this narrative from his own lips. </p>
            <p>`Beatrice de las Cisternas took the veil <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0100"
                n="87"/>at an early age, not by her own choice, but at the express command
              of her Parents. She was then too young to regret the pleasures, of which her
              profession deprived her: But no sooner did her warm and voluptuous character
              begin to be developed, than She abandoned herself freely to the impulse of
              her passions, and seized the first opportunity to procure their
              gratification. This opportunity was at length presented, after many
              obstacles which only added new force to her desires. She contrived to elope
              from the Convent, and fled to Germany with the Baron Lindenberg. She lived
              at his Castle several months as his avowed Concubine: All Bavaria was
              scandalized by her impudent and abandoned conduct. Her feasts vied in luxury
              with Cleopatra's, and Lindenberg became the Theatre of the most unbridled
              debauchery. Not satisfied with displaying the incontinence of a Prostitute,
              She professed herself an Atheist: She took every opportunity to scoff at her
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0101" n="88"/>monastic vows, and loaded with
              ridicule the most sacred ceremonies of Religion. </p>
            <p>`Possessed of a character so depraved, She did not long confine her
              affections to one object. Soon after her arrival at the Castle, the Baron's
              younger Brother attracted her notice by his strong-marked features, gigantic
              Stature, and Herculean limbs. She was not of an humour to keep her
              inclinations long unknown; But She found in Otto von Lindenberg her equal in
              depravity. He returned her passion just sufficiently to increase it; and
              when He had worked it up to the desired pitch, He fixed the price of his
              love at his Brother's murder. The Wretch consented to this horrible
              agreement. A night was pitched upon for perpetrating the deed. Otto, who
              resided on a small Estate a few miles distant from the Castle, promised that
              at One in the morning He would be waiting for her at Lindenberg Hole; that
              He would bring with him a party of chosen Friends, by whose aid He doubted
              not being <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0102" n="89"/>able to make himself
              Master of the Castle; and that his next step should be the uniting her hand
              to his. It was this last promise, which overruled every scruple of Beatrice,
              since in spite of his affection for her, the Baron had declared positively,
              that He never would make her his Wife. </p>
            <p>`The fatal night arrived. The Baron slept in the arms of his perfidious
              Mistress, when the Castle-Bell struck `One.' Immediately Beatrice drew a
              dagger from underneath the pillow, and plunged it in her Paramour's heart.
              The Baron uttered a single dreadful groan, and expired. The Murderess
              quitted her bed hastily, took a Lamp in one hand, in the other the bloody
              dagger, and bent her course towards the cavern. The Porter dared not to
              refuse opening the Gates to one more dreaded in the Castle, than its Master.
              Beatrice reached Lindenberg Hole unopposed, where according to promise She
              found Otto waiting for her. He received, and listened to her narrative with
              transport: But ere <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0103" n="90"/>She had time to
              ask why He came unaccompanied, He convinced her that He wished for no
              witnesses to their interview. Anxious to conceal his share in the murder,
              and to free himself from a Woman, whose violent and atrocious character made
              him tremble with reason for his own safety, He had resolved on the
              destruction of his wretched Agent. Rushing upon her suddenly, He wrested the
              dagger from her hand: He plunged it still reeking with his Brother's blood
              in her bosom, and put an end to her existence by repeated blows. </p>
            <p>`Otto now succeeded to the Barony of Lindenberg. The murder was attributed
              solely to the fugitive Nun, and no one suspected him to have persuaded her
              to the action. But though his crime was unpunished by Man, God's justice
              permitted him not to enjoy in peace his blood-stained honours. Her bones
              lying still unburied in the Cave, the restless soul of Beatrice continued to
              inhabit the Castle. Drest in her religious habit in memory of her vows <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0104" n="91"/>broken to heaven, furnished with the
              dagger which had drank the blood of her Paramour, and holding the Lamp which
              had guided her flying steps, every night did She stand before the Bed of
              Otto. The most dreadful confusion reigned through the Castle; The vaulted
              chambers resounded with shrieks and groans; And the Spectre, as She ranged
              along the antique Galleries, uttered an incoherent mixture of prayers and
              blasphemies. Otto was unable to withstand the shock, which He felt at this
              fearful Vision: Its horror increased with every succeeding appearance: His
              alarm at length became so insupportable, that his heart burst, and one
              morning He was found in his bed totally deprived of warmth and animation.
              His death did not put an end to the nocturnal riots. The bones of Beatrice
              continued to lie unburied, and her Ghost continued to haunt the Castle. </p>
            <p>`The domains of Lindenberg now fell to a distant Relation. But terrified by
              the accounts given him of the Bleeding Nun <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0105"
                n="92"/>(So was the Spectre called by the multitude,) the new Baron called
              to his assistance a celebrated Exorciser. This holy Man succeeded in
              obliging her to temporary repose; But though She discovered to him her
              history, He was not permitted to reveal it to others, or cause her skeleton
              to be removed to hallowed ground. That Office was reserved for you, and till
              your coming her Ghost was doomed to wander about the Castle, and lament the
              crime which She had there committed. However, the Exorciser obliged her to
              silence during his lifetime. So long as He existed, the haunted chamber was
              shut up, and the Spectre was invisible. At his death which happened in five
              years after, She again appeared, but only once on every fifth year, on the
              same day and at the same hour when She plunged her Knife in the heart of her
              sleeping Lover: She then visited the Cavern which held her mouldering
              skeleton, returned to the Castle as soon as the Clock struck `Two,' and was
              seen no more till the next five years had elapsed. </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0106" n="93"/>`She was doomed to suffer during
              the space of a Century. That period is past. Nothing now remains but to
              consign to the Grave the ashes of Beatrice. I have been the means of
              releasing you from your visionary Tormentor; and amidst all the sorrows
              which oppress me, to think that I have been of use to you, is some
              consolation. Youth, farewell! May the Ghost of your Relation enjoy that rest
              in the Tomb, which the Almighty's vengeance has denied to me for ever!' </p>
            <p>Here the Stranger prepared to quit the apartment. </p>
            <p>`Stay yet one moment!' said I; `You have satisfied my curiosity with regard
              to the Spectre, but you leave me in prey to yet greater respecting yourself.
              Deign to inform me, to whom I am under such real obligations. You mention
              circumstances long past, and persons long dead: You were personally
              acquainted with the Exorciser, who by your own account has been deceased
              near a Century. How am I to <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0107" n="94"/>account
              for this? What means that burning Cross upon your fore-head, and why did the
              sight of it strike such horror to my soul?' </p>
            <p>On these points He for some time refused to satisfy me. At length overcome
              by my entreaties, He consented to clear up the whole, on condition that I
              would defer his explanation till the next day. With this request I was
              obliged to comply, and He left me. In the Morning my first care was to
              enquire after the mysterious Stranger. Conceive my disappointment, when
              informed that He had already quitted Ratisbon. I dispatched messengers in
              pursuit of him but in vain. No traces of the Fugitive were discovered. Since
              that moment I never have heard any more of him, and 'tis most probable that
              I never shall.' </p>
            <p>[Lorenzo here interrupted his Friend's narrative. </p>
            <p>`How?' said He; `You have never discovered who He was, or even formed a
              guess?' </p>
            <p>`Pardon me,' replied the Marquis;<pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0108" n="95"/>
              `When I related this adventure to my Uncle, the Cardinal-Duke, He told me
              that He had no doubt of this singular Man's being the celebrated Character
              known universally by the name of `<hi rend="italic">the wandering Jew</hi>.'
              His not being permitted to pass more than fourteen days on the same spot,
              the burning Cross impressed upon his fore-head, the effect which it produced
              upon the Beholders, and many other circumstances give this supposition the
              colour of truth. The Cardinal is fully persuaded of it; and for my own part
              I am inclined to adopt the only solution which offers itself to this riddle.
              I return to the narrative from which I have digressed.'] </p>
            <p>From this period I recovered my health so rapidly as to astonish my
              Physicians. The Bleeding Nun appeared no more, and I was soon able to set
              out for Lindenberg. The Baron received me with open arms. I confided to him
              the sequel of my adventure; and He was not a little pleased to find, that
              his Mansion would be no longer troubled <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0109"
                n="96"/>with the Phantom's quiennial visits. I was sorry to perceive, that
              absence had not weakened Donna Rodolpha's imprudent passion. In a private
              conversation, which I had with her during my short stay at the Castle, She
              renewed her attempts to persuade me to return her affection. Regarding her
              as the primary cause of all my sufferings, I entertained for her no other
              sentiment than disgust. The Skeleton of Beatrice was found in the place
              which She had mentioned. This being all that I sought at Lindenberg, I
              hastened to quit the Baron's domains, equally anxious to perform the
              obsequies of the murdered Nun, and escape the importunity of a Woman whom I
              detested. I departed, followed by Donna Rodolpha's menaces that my contempt
              should not be long unpunished. </p>
            <p>I now bent my course towards Spain with all diligence. Lucas with my
              Baggage had joined me during my abode at Lindenberg. I arrived in my native
              Country without any accident, and immediately <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0110" n="97"/>proceeded to my Father's Castle in
              Andalusia. The remains of Beatrice were deposited in the family vault, all
              due ceremonies performed, and the number of Masses said which She had
              required. Nothing now hindered me from employing all my endeavours to
              discover the retreat of Agnes. The Baroness had assured me, that her Niece
              had already taken the veil: This intelligence I suspected to have been
              forged by jealousy, and hoped to find my Mistress still at liberty to accept
              my hand. I enquired after her family; I found that before her Daughter could
              reach Madrid, Donna Inesilla was no more: You, my dear Lorenzo, were said to
              be abroad, but where I could not discover: Your Father was in a distant
              Province on a visit to the Duke de Medina, and as to Agnes no one could or
              would inform me what was become of her. Theodore according to promise had
              returned to Strasbourg, where He found his Grand-father dead, and Marguerite
              in possession of his fortune. All her <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0111"
                n="98"/>persuasions to remain with her were fruitless: He quitted her a
              second time, and followed me to Madrid. He exerted himself to the utmost in
              forwarding my search: But our united endeavours were unattended by success.
              The retreat, which concealed Agnes remained an impenetrable mystery, and I
              began to abandon all hopes of recovering her. </p>
            <p>About eight months ago I was returning to my Hotel in a melancholy humour,
              having past the evening at the Play-House. The Night was dark, and I was
              unaccompanied. Plunged in reflections which were far from being agreeable, I
              perceived not that three Men had followed me from the Theatre; till, on
              turning into an unfrequented Street, they all attacked me at the same time
              with the utmost fury. I sprang back a few paces, drew my sword, and threw my
              cloak over my left arm. The obscurity of the night was in my favour. For the
              most part the blows of the Assassins, being aimed at random, failed to touch
              me. I at length was <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0112" n="99"/>fortunate
              enough to lay one of my Adversaries at my feet; But before this I had
              already received so many wounds, and was so warmly pressed, that my
              destruction would have been inevitable, had not the clashing of swords
              called a Cavalier to my assistance. He ran towards me with his sword drawn:
              Several Domestics followed him with torches. His arrival made the combat
              equal: Yet would not the Bravoes abandon their design, till the Servants
              were on the point of joining us. They then fled away, and we lost them in
              the obscurity. </p>
            <p>The Stranger now addressed himself to me with politeness, and enquired
              whether I was wounded. Faint with the loss of blood, I could scarcely thank
              him for his seasonable aid, and entreat him to let some of his Servants
              convey me to the Hotel de las Cisternas. I no sooner mentioned the name than
              He profest himself an acquaintance of my Father's, and declared that He
              would not permit my being transported to <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0113"
                n="100"/>such a distance, before my wounds had been examined. He added,
              that his House was hard by, and begged me to accompany him thither. His
              manner was so earnest, that I could not reject his offer, and leaning upon
              his arm, a few minutes brought me to the Porch of a magnificent Hotel. </p>
            <p>On entering the House, an old grey-headed Domestic came to welcome my
              Conductor: He enquired when the Duke, his Master, meant to quit the Country,
              and was answered that He would remain there yet some months. My Deliverer
              then desired the family-Surgeon to be summoned without delay. His orders
              were obeyed. I was seated upon a Sopha in a noble apartment; and my wounds
              being examined, they were declared to be very slight. The Surgeon, however,
              advised me not to expose myself to the night-air; and the Stranger pressed
              me so earnestly to take a bed in his House, that I consented to remain where
              I was for the present. </p>
            <p>Being now left alone with my Deliverer, I took the opportunity of thanking
              him in <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0114" n="101"/>more express terms, than I
              had done hitherto: But He begged me to be silent upon the subject. </p>
            <p>`I esteem myself happy,' said He, `in having had it in my power to render
              you this little service; and I shall think myself eternally obliged to my
              Daughter for detaining me so late at the Convent of St. Clare. The high
              esteem in which I have ever held the Marquis de las Cisternas, though
              accident has not permitted our being so intimate as I could wish, makes me
              rejoice in the opportunity of making his Son's acquaintance. I am certain
              that my Brother in whose House you now are, will lament his not being at
              Madrid to receive you himself: But in the Duke's absence I am Master of the
              family, and may assure you in his name, that every thing in the Hotel de
              Medina is perfectly at your disposal.' </p>
            <p>Conceive my surprize, Lorenzo, at discovering in the person of my Preserver
              Don Gaston de Medina: It was only to be equalled by my secret satisfaction
              at the <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0115" n="102"/> assurance, that Agnes
              inhabited the Convent of St. Clare. This latter sensation was not a little
              weakened, when in answer to my seemingly indifferent questions He told me,
              that his Daughter had really taken the veil. I suffered not my grief at this
              circumstance to take root in my mind: I flattered myself with the idea that
              my Uncle's credit at the Court of Rome would remove this obstacle, and that
              without difficulty I should obtain for my Mistress a dispensation from her
              vows. Buoyed up with this hope I calmed the uneasiness of my bosom; and I
              redoubled my endeavours to appear grateful for the attention, and pleased
              with the society of Don Gaston. </p>
            <p>A Domestic now entered the room, and informed me that the Bravo whom I had
              wounded, discovered some signs of life. I desired that He might be carried
              to my Father's Hotel, and that as soon as He recovered his voice, I would
              examine him respecting his reasons for attempting my life. I was answered,
              that He was already able to speak, <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0116" n="103"
              />though with difficulty: Don Gaston's curiosity made him press me to
              interrogate the Assassin in his presence, but this curiosity I was by no
              means inclined to gratify. One reason was, that doubting from whence the
              blow came, I was unwilling to place before Don Gaston's eyes the guilt of a
              Sister: Another was, that I feared to be recognized for Alphonso d'Alvarada,
              and precautions taken in consequence to keep me from the sight of Agnes. To
              avow my passion for his Daughter, and endeavour to make him enter into my
              schemes, what I knew of Don Gaston's character convinced me would be an
              imprudent step: and considering it to be essential that He should know me
              for no other than the Cond&eacute; de las Cisternas, I was determined
              not to let him hear the Bravo's confession. I insinuated to him, that as I
              suspected a Lady to be concerned in the Business, whose name might
              accidentally escape from the Assassin, it was necessary for me to examine
              the Man in private. Don Gaston's delicacy would not permit his <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0117" n="104"/>urging the point any longer, and in
              consequence the Bravo was conveyed to my Hotel. </p>
            <p>The next Morning I took leave of my Host, who was to return to the Duke on
              the same day. My wounds had been so trifling, that except being obliged to
              wear my arm in a sling for a short time, I felt no inconvenience from the
              night's adventure. The Surgeon who examined the Bravo's wound declared it to
              be mortal: He had just time to confess, that He had been instigated to
              murder me by the revengeful Donna Rodolpha, and expired in a few minutes
              after. </p>
            <p>All my thoughts were now bent upon getting to the speech of my lovely Nun.
              Theodore set himself to work, and for this time with better success. He
              attacked the Gardener of St. Clare so forcibly with bribes and promises,
              that the Old Man was entirely gained over to my interests; and it was
              settled, that I should be introduced into the Convent in the character of
              his Assistant. <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0118" n="105"/>The plan was put
              into execution without delay. Disguised in a common habit, and a black patch
              covering one of my eyes, I was presented to the Lady Prioress, who
              condescended to approve of the Gardener's choice. I immediately entered upon
              my employment. Botany having been a favourite study with me, I was by no
              means at a loss in my new station. For some days I continued to work in the
              Convent-Garden without meeting the Object of my disguise: On the fourth
              Morning I was more successful. I heard the voice of Agnes, and was speeding
              towards the sound, when the sight of the Domina stopped me. I drew back with
              caution, and concealed myself behind a thick clump of Trees. </p>
            <p>The Prioress advanced, and seated herself with Agnes on a Bench at no great
              distance. I heard her in an angry tone blame her Companion's continual
              melancholy: She told her that to weep the loss of any Lover in her situation
              was a crime; But that to weep the loss of a faithless one was folly <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0119" n="106"/>and absurdity in the extreme. Agnes
              replied in so low a voice that I could not distinguish her words, but I
              perceived that She used terms of gentleness and submission. The conversation
              was interrupted by the arrival of a young Pensioner, who informed the Domina
              that She was waited for in the Parlour. The old Lady rose, kissed the cheek
              of Agnes, and retired. The new-comer remained. Agnes spoke much to her in
              praise of somebody whom I could not make out, but her Auditor seemed highly
              delighted, and interested by the conversation. The Nun showed her several
              letters; the Other perused them with evident pleasure, obtained permission
              to copy them, and withdrew for that purpose to my great satisfaction. </p>
            <p>No sooner was She out of sight, than I quitted my concealment. Fearing to
              alarm my lovely Mistress, I drew near her gently, intending to discover
              myself by degrees. But who for a moment can deceive the eyes of love? She
              raised her head at my approach, <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0120" n="107"
              />and recognised me in spite of my disguise at a single glance. She rose
              hastily from her seat with an exclamation of surprize, and attempted to
              retire; But I followed her, detained her, and entreated to be heard.
              Persuaded of my falsehood She refused to listen to me, and ordered me
              positively to quit the Garden. It was now my turn to refuse. I protested,
              that however dangerous might be the consequences, I would not leave her till
              She had heard my justification. I assured her, that She had been deceived by
              the artifices of her Relations; that I could convince her beyond the power
              of doubt, that my passion had been pure and disinterested; and I asked her,
              what should induce me to seek her in the Convent, were I influenced by the
              selfish motives which my Enemies had ascribed to me. </p>
            <p>My prayers, my arguments, and vows not to quit her, till She had promised
              to listen to me, united to her fears lest the Nuns should see me with her,
              to her natural curiosity, and to the effection which She still felt for <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0121" n="108"/>me in spite of my supposed
              desertion, at length prevailed. She told me, that to grant my request at
              that moment was impossible; But She engaged to be in the same spot at eleven
              that night, and to converse with me for the last time. Having obtained this
              promise I released her hand, and She fled back with rapidity towards the
              Convent. </p>
            <p>I communicated my success to my Ally, the old Gardener: He pointed out an
              hiding-place, where I might shelter myself till night without fear of a
              discovery. Thither I betook myself at the hour when I ought to have retired
              with my supposed Master, and waited impatiently for the appointed time. The
              chillness of the night was in my favour, since it kept the other Nuns
              confined to their Cells. Agnes alone was insensible of the inclemency of the
              Air, and before eleven joined me at the spot, which had witnessed our former
              interview. Secure from interruption I related to her the true cause of my
              disappearing on the fatal fifth of May. <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0122"
                n="109"/>She was evidently much affected by my narrative: When it was
              concluded, She confessed the injustice of her suspicions, and blamed herself
              for having taken the veil through despair at my ingratitude. </p>
            <p>`But now it is too late to repine!' She added; `The die is thrown: I have
              pronounced my vows, and dedicated myself to the service of heaven. I am
              sensible, how ill I am calculated for a Convent. My disgust at a monastic
              life increases daily: Ennui and discontent are my constant Companions; and I
              will not conceal from you, that the passion which I formerly felt for one so
              near being my Husband is not yet extinguished in my bosom. But we must part!
              Insuperable Barriers divide us from each other, and on this side the Grave
              we must never meet again!' </p>
            <p>I now exerted myself to prove, that our union was not so impossible as She
              seemed to think it. I vaunted to her the Cardinal-Duke of Lerma's influence
              at the Court of Rome: I assured her, that I should easily <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0123" n="110"/>obtain a dispensation from her vows;
              and I doubted not but Don Gaston would coincide with my views, when informed
              of my real name and long attachment. Agnes replied, that since I encouraged
              such an hope, I could know but little of her Father. Liberal and kind in
              every other respect, Superstition formed the only stain upon his character.
              Upon this head He was inflexible; He sacrificed his dearest interests to his
              scruples, and would consider it an insult to suppose him capable, of
              authorising his daughter to break her vows to heaven. </p>
            <p>`But suppose,' said I interrupting her; `Suppose, that He should disapprove
              of our union; Let him remain ignorant of my proceedings, till I have rescued
              you from the prison, in which you are now confined. Once my Wife, you are
              free from his authority: I need from him no pecuniary assistance; and when
              He sees his resentment to be unavailing, He will doubtless restore you to
              his favour. But let the worst happen; Should Don Gaston be irreconcileable,
              my Relations <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0124" n="111"/>will vie with each
              other in making you forget his loss: and you will find in my Father a
              substitute for the Parent of whom I shall deprive you.' </p>
            <p>`Don Raymond,' replied Agnes in a firm and resolute voice, `I love my
              Father: He has treated me harshly in this one instance; but I have received
              from him in every other so many proofs of love, that his affection is become
              necessary to my existence. Were I to quit the Convent, He never would
              forgive me; nor can I think that on his death-bed He would leave me his
              curse, without shuddering at the very idea. Besides, I am conscious myself,
              that my vows are binding: Wilfully did I contract my engagement with heaven;
              I cannot break it without a crime. Then banish from your mind the idea of
              our being ever united. I am devoted to religion; and however I may grieve at
              our separation, I would oppose obstacles myself, to what I feel would render
              me guilty.' </p>
            <p>I strove to over-rule these ill-grounded <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0125"
                n="112"/>scruples: We were still disputing upon the subject, when the
              Convent- Bell summoned the Nuns to Matins. Agnes was obliged to attend them;
              But She left me not, till I had compelled her to promise, that on the
              following night She would be at the same place at the same hour. These
              meetings continued for several Weeks uninterrupted; and 'tis now, Lorenzo,
              that I must implore your indulgence. Reflect upon our situation, our youth,
              our long attachment: Weigh all the circumstances which attended our
              assignations, and you will confess the temptation to have been irresistible;
              you will even pardon me when I acknowledge, that in an unguarded moment the
              honour of Agnes was sacrificed to my passion.' </p>
            <p>[Lorenzo's eyes sparkled with fury: A deep crimson spread itself over his
              face. He started from his seat, and attempted to draw his sword. The Marquis
              was aware of his movement, and caught his hand: He pressed it
              affectionately. </p>
            <p>`My Friend! My Brother! Hear me to <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0126" n="113"
              />the conclusion! Till then restrain your passion, and be at least
              convinced, that if what I have related is criminal, the blame must fall upon
              me, and not upon your Sister.' </p>
            <p>Lorenzo suffered himself to be prevailed upon by Don Raymond's entreaties.
              He resumed his place, and listened to the rest of the narrative with a
              gloomy and impatient countenance. The Marquis thus continued.] </p>
            <p>`Scarcely was the first burst of passion past, when Agnes recovering
              herself started from my arms with horror. She called me infamous Seducer,
              loaded me with the bitterest reproaches, and beat her bosom in all the
              wildness of delirium. Ashamed of my imprudence, I with difficulty found
              words to excuse myself. I endeavoured to console her; I threw myself at her
              feet, and entreated her forgiveness. She forced her hand from me, which I
              had taken, and would have prest to my lips. </p>
            <p>`Touch me not!' She cried with a <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0127" n="114"
              />violence which terrified me; `Monster of perfidy and ingratitude, how have
              I been deceived in you! I looked upon you as my Friend, my Protector: I
              trusted myself in your hands with confidence, and relying upon your honour
              thought that mine ran no risque. And 'tis by you, whom I adored, that I am
              covered with infamy! 'Tis by you that I have been seduced into breaking my
              vows to God, that I am reduced to a level with the basest of my sex! Shame
              upon you, Villain, you shall never see me more!' </p>
            <p>She started from the Bank on which She was seated. I endeavoured to detain
              her; But She disengaged herself from me with violence, and took refuge in
              the Convent. </p>
            <p>I retired, filled with confusion and inquietude. The next morning I failed
              not as usual to appear in the Garden; but Agnes was no where to be seen. At
              night I waited for her at the place where we generally met; I found no
              better success. Several days and nights passed away in the same manner. At
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0128" n="115"/>length I saw my offended
              Mistress cross the walk, on whose borders I was working: She was accompanied
              by the same young Pensioner, on whose arm She seemed from weakness obliged
              to support herself. She looked upon me for a moment, but instantly turned
              her head away. I waited her return; But She passed on to the Convent without
              paying any attention to me, or the penitent looks with which I implored her
              forgiveness. </p>
            <p>As soon as the Nuns were retired, the old Gardener joined me with a
              sorrowful air. </p>
            <p>`Segnor,' said He, `it grieves me to say, that I can be no longer of use to
              you. The Lady whom you used to meet, has just assured me, that if I admitted
              you again into the Garden, She would discover the whole business to the Lady
              Prioress. She bade me tell you also, that your presence was an insult, and
              that if you still possess the least respect for her, you will never attempt
              to see her more. Excuse me then <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0129" n="116"
              />for informing you, that I can favour your disguise no longer. Should the
              Prioress be acquainted with my conduct, She might not be contented with
              dismissing me her service: Out of revenge She might accuse me of having
              profaned the Convent, and cause me to be thrown into the Prisons of the
              Inquisition.' </p>
            <p>Fruitless were my attempts to conquer his resolution. He denied me all
              future entrance into the Garden, and Agnes persevered in neither letting me
              see, or hear from her. In about a fortnight after a violent illness which
              had seized my Father, obliged me to set out for Andalusia. I hastened
              thither, and as I imagined, found the Marquis at the point of death. Though
              on its first appearance his complaint was declared mortal, He lingered out
              several Months; during which my attendance upon him during his malady, and
              the occupation of settling his affairs after his decease, permitted not my
              quitting Andalusia. Within these four days I returned to Madrid, and on <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002619_0130" n="117"/>arriving at my Hotel, I there found
              this letter waiting for me. </p>
            <p>[Here the Marquis unlocked the drawer of a Cabinet: He took out a folded
              paper, which He presented to his Auditor. Lorenzo opened it, and recognised
              his Sister's hand. The Contents were as follows. </p>
            <p>Into what an abyss of misery have you plunged me! Raymond, you force me to
              become as criminal as yourself. I had resolved never to see you more; if
              possible, to forget you; If not, only to remember you with hate. A Being for
              whom I already feel a Mother's tenderness, solicits me to pardon my Seducer,
              and apply to his love for the means of preservation. Raymond, your child
              lives in my bosom. I tremble at the vengeance of the Prioress; I tremble
              much for myself, yet more for the innocent Creature whose existence depends
              upon mine. Both of us are lost, should my situation be discovered. Advise me
              then what steps to take, but <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0131" n="118"/>seek
              not to see me. The Gardener, who undertakes to deliver this, is dismissed,
              and we have nothing to hope from that quarter: The Man engaged in his place
              is of incorruptible fidelity. The best means of conveying to me your answer,
              is by concealing it under the great Statue of St. Francis, which stands in
              the Capuchin-Cathedral. Thither I go every Thursday to confession, and shall
              easily have an opportunity of securing your letter. I hear, that you are now
              absent from Madrid; Need I entreat you to write the very moment of your
              return? I will not think it. Ah! Raymond! Mine is a cruel situation!
              Deceived by my nearest Relations, compelled to embrace a profession the
              duties of which I am ill-calculated to perform, conscious of the sanctity of
              those duties, and seduced into violating them by One whom I least suspected
              of perfidy, I am now obliged by circumstances to chuse between death and
              perjury. Woman's timidity, and maternal affection permit me not to balance
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0132" n="119"/>in the choice. I feel all the
              guilt into which I plunge myself, when I yield to the plan which you before
              proposed to me. My poor Father's death which has taken place since we met,
              has removed one obstacle. He sleeps in his grave, and I no longer dread his
              anger. But from the anger of God, Oh! Raymond! who shall shield me? Who can
              protect me against my conscience, against myself? I dare not dwell upon
              these thoughts; They will drive me mad. I have taken my resolution: Procure
              a dispensation from my vows; I am ready to fly with you. Write to me, my
              Husband! Tell me, that absence has not abated your love, tell me that you
              will rescue from death your unborn Child, and its unhappy Mother. I live in
              all the agonies of terror: Every eye which is fixed upon me, seems to read
              my secret and my shame. And you are the cause of those agonies! Oh! When my
              heart first loved you, how little did it suspect you of making it feel such
              pangs!<lb/>Agnes.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0133" n="120"/>Having perused the letter,
              Lorenzo restored it in silence. The Marquis replaced it in the Cabinet, and
              then proceeded.] </p>
            <p>`Excessive was my joy at reading this intelligence so earnestly-desired, so
              little expected. My plan was soon arranged. When Don Gaston discovered to me
              his Daughter's retreat, I entertained no doubt of her readiness to quit the
              Convent: I had, therefore, entrusted the Cardinal-Duke of Lerma with the
              whole affair, who immediately busied himself in obtaining the necessary
              Bull. Fortunately I had afterwards neglected to stop his proceedings. Not
              long since I received a letter from him, stating that He expected daily to
              receive the order from the Court of Rome. Upon this I would willingly have
              relyed: But the Cardinal wrote me word, that I must find some means of
              conveying Agnes out of the Convent, unknown to the Prioress. He doubted not
              but this Latter would be much incensed by losing a Person of such high rank
              from her society, and consider the renunciation of Agnes as an insult to her
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0134" n="121"/>House. He represented her as a
              Woman of a violent and revengeful character, capable of proceeding to the
              greatest extremities. It was therefore to be feared, lest by confining Agnes
              in the Convent She should frustrate my hopes, and render the Pope's mandate
              unavailing. Influenced by this consideration, I resolved to carry off my
              Mistress, and conceal her till the arrival of the expected Bull in the
              Cardinal-Duke's Estate. He approved of my design, and profest himself ready
              to give a shelter to the Fugitive. I next caused the new Gardener of St.
              Clare to be seized privately, and confined in my Hotel. By this means I
              became Master of the Key to the Garden-door, and I had now nothing more to
              do than prepare Agnes for the elopement. This was done by the letter, which
              you saw me deliver this Evening. I told her in it, that I should be ready to
              receive her at twelve tomorrow night, that I had secured the Key of the
              Garden, and that She might depend upon a speedy release. </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0135" n="122"/>You have now, Lorenzo, heard the
              whole of my long narrative. I have nothing to say in my excuse, save that my
              intentions towards your Sister have been ever the most honourable: That it
              has always been, and still is my design to make her my Wife: And that I
              trust, when you consider these circumstances, our youth, and our attachment,
              you will not only forgive our momentary lapse from virtue, but will aid me
              in repairing my faults to Agnes, and securing a lawful title to her person
              and her heart.</p>

          <p>HERE THE MARQUIS concluded his adventures. Lorenzo, before He could determine
            on his reply, past some moments in reflection. At length He broke silence. </p>
          <p>`Raymond,' said He taking his hand, `strict honour would oblige me to wash
            off in your blood the stain thrown upon my family; But the circumstances of
            your case forbid me to consider you as an Enemy. The temptation was too great
            to be resisted. 'Tis the superstition of my Relations which has <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0137" n="124"/>occasioned these misfortunes, and they
            are more the Offenders than yourself and Agnes. What has past between you
            cannot be recalled, but may yet be repaired by uniting you to my Sister. You
            have ever been, you still continue to be, my dearest and indeed my only
            Friend. I feel for Agnes the truest affection, and there is no one on whom I
            would bestow her more willingly than on yourself. Pursue then your design. I
            will accompany you tomorrow night, and conduct her myself to the House of the
            Cardinal. My presence will be a sanction for her conduct, and prevent her
            incurring blame by her flight from the Convent.' </p>
          <p>The Marquis thanked him in terms by no means deficient in gratitude. Lorenzo
            then informed him, that He had nothing more to apprehend from Donna Rodolpha's
            enmity. Five Months had already elapsed, since in an excess of passion She
            broke a blood-vessel, and expired in the course of a few hours. He then
            proceeded to mention the interests of Antonia. The Marquis was much <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0138" n="125"/>surprized at hearing of this new
            Relation: His Father had carried his hatred of Elvira to the Grave, and had
            never given the least hint, that He knew what was become of his eldest Son's
            Widow. Don Raymond assured his friend, that He was not mistaken in supposing
            him ready to acknowledge his Sister-in-law, and her amiable Daughter. The
            preparations for the elopement would not permit his visiting them the next
            day; But in the mean while He desired Lorenzo to assure them of his
            friendship, and to supply Elvira upon his account with any sums which She
            might want. This the Youth promised to do, as soon as her abode should be
            known to him: He then took leave of his future Brother, and returned to the
            Palace de Medina. </p>
          <p>The day was already on the point of breaking, when the Marquis retired to his
            chamber. Conscious that his narrative would take up some hours, and wishing to
            secure himself from interruption, on returning to the Hotel He ordered his
            Attendants not to sit up for <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0139" n="126"/>him.
            Consequently, He was somewhat surprised on entering his Anti-room, to find
            Theodore established there. The Page sat near a Table with a pen in his hand,
            and was so totally occupied by his employment, that He perceived not his
            Lord's approach. The Marquis stopped to observe him. Theodore wrote a few
            lines, then paused, and scratched out a part of the writing: Then wrote again,
            smiled, and seemed highly pleased with what He had been about. At last He
            threw down his pen, sprang from his chair, and clapped his hands together
            joyfully. </p>
          <p>`There it is!' cried He aloud: `Now they are charming!' </p>
          <p>His transports were interrupted by a laugh from the Marquis, who suspected
            the nature of his employment. </p>
          <p>`What is so charming, Theodore?' </p>
          <p>The Youth started, and looked round. He blushed, ran to the Table, seized the
            paper on which He had been writing, and concealed it in confusion. </p>
          <p>`Oh! my Lord, I knew not that you were <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0140"
              n="127"/>so near me. Can I be of use to you? Lucas is already gone to bed.' </p>
          <p>`I shall follow his example when I have given my opinion of your verses.' </p>
          <p>`My verses, my Lord?' </p>
          <p>`Nay, I am sure that you have been writing some, for nothing else could have
            kept you awake till this time of the morning. Where are they, Theodore? I
            shall like to see your composition.' </p>
          <p>Theodore's cheeks glowed with still deeper crimson: He longed to show his
            poetry, but first chose to be pressed for it. </p>
          <p>`Indeed, my Lord, they are not worthy your attention.' </p>
          <p>`Not these verses, which you just now declared to be so charming? Come, come,
            let me see whether our opinions are the same. I promise, that you shall find
            in me an indulgent Critic.' </p>
          <p>The Boy produced his paper with seeming reluctance; but the satisfaction
            which sparkled in his dark expressive eyes betrayed the vanity of his little
            bosom. The <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0141" n="128"/>Marquis smiled while He
            observed the emotions of an heart, as yet but little skilled in veiling its
            sentiments. He seated himself upon a Sopha: Theodore, while Hope and fear
            contended on his anxious countenance, waited with inquietude for his Master's
            decision, while the Marquis read the following lines.</p>

          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0146" n="133"/>`Your little poem pleases me much,'
            said He; `However, you must not count my opinion for any-thing. I am no judge
            of verses, and for my own part, never composed more than six lines in my life:
            Those six produced so unlucky an effect, that I am fully resolved never to
            compose another. But I wander from my subject. I was going to say, that you
            cannot employ your time worse than in making verses. An Author, whether good
            or bad, or between both, is an Animal whom every body is privileged to attack;
            For though All are not able to write books, all conceive themselves able to
            judge them. A bad composition carries with it its own punishment, contempt and
            ridicule. A good one excites envy, and entails upon its Author a thousand
            mortifications. He finds himself assailed by partial and ill-humoured
            Criticism: One Man finds fault with the plan, Another with the style, a Third
            with the precept, which it strives to inculcate; and they who cannot succeed
            in finding fault with the Book, <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0147" n="134"
            />employ themselves in stigmatizing its Author. They maliciously rake out from
            obscurity every little circumstance, which may throw ridicule upon his private
            character or conduct, and aim at wounding the Man, since They cannot hurt the
            Writer. In short to enter the lists of literature is wilfully to expose
            yourself to the arrows of neglect, ridicule, envy, and disappointment. Whether
            you write well or ill, be assured that you will not escape from blame; Indeed
            this circumstance contains a young Author's chief consolation: He remembers
            that Lope de Vega and Calderona had unjust and envious Critics, and He
            modestly conceives himself to be exactly in their predicament. But I am
            conscious, that all these sage observations are thrown away upon you.
            Authorship is a mania to conquer which no reasons are sufficiently strong; and
            you might as easily persuade me not to love, as I persuade you not to write.
            However, if you cannot help being occasionally seized with a poetical
            paroxysm, take at least the <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0148" n="135"
            />precaution of communicating your verses to none but those, whose partiality
            for you secures their approbation.' </p>
          <p>`Then, my Lord, you do not think these lines tolerable?' said Theodore with
            an humble and dejected air. </p>
          <p>`You mistake my meaning. As I said before, they have pleased me much; But my
            regard for you makes me partial, and Others might judge them less favourably.
            I must still remark, that even my prejudice in your favour does not blind me
            so much, as to prevent my observing several faults. For instance, you make a
            terrible confusion of metaphors; You are too apt to make the strength of your
            lines consist more in the words than sense; Some of the verses only seem
            introduced in order to rhyme with others; and most of the best ideas are
            borrowed from other Poets, though possibly you are unconscious of the theft
            yourself. These faults may occasionally be excused in a work of length; But a
            short Poem must be correct and perfect.' </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0149" n="136"/>`All this is true, Segnor; But you
            should consider that I only write for pleasure.' </p>
          <p>`Your defects are the less excusable. Their incorrectness may be forgiven,
            who work for money, who are obliged to compleat a given task in a given time,
            and are paid according to the bulk, not value of their productions. But in
            those whom no necessity forces to turn Author, who merely write for fame, and
            have full leisure to polish their compositions, faults are impardonable, and
            merit the sharpest arrows of criticism.' </p>
          <p>The Marquis rose from the Sopha; the Page looked discouraged and melancholy,
            and this did not escape his Master's observation. </p>
          <p>`However' added He smiling, `I think that these lines do you no discredit.
            Your versification is tolerably easy, and your ear seems to be just. The
            perusal of your little poem upon the whole gave me much pleasure; and if it is
            not asking too great a <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0150" n="137"/>favour, I
            shall be highly obliged to you for a Copy.' </p>
          <p>The Youth's countenance immediately cleared up. He perceived not the smile,
            half approving, half ironical, which accompanied the request, and He promised
            the Copy with great readiness. The Marquis with-drew to his chamber, much
            amused by the instantaneous effect produced upon Theodore's vanity by the
            conclusion of his Criticism. He threw himself upon his Couch; Sleep soon stole
            over him, and his dreams presented him with the most flattering pictures of
            happiness with Agnes. </p>
          <p>On reaching the Hotel de Medina, Lorenzo's first care was to enquire for
            Letters. He found several waiting for him; but that which He sought, was not
            amongst them. Leonella had found it impossible to write that evening. However,
            her impatience to secure Don Christoval's heart, on which She flattered
            herself with having made no slight impression, permitted her not to pass
            another day, without informing him where <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0151"
              n="138"/>She was to be found. On her return from the Capuchin-Church, She
            had related to her Sister with exultation, how attentive an handsome Cavalier
            had been to her; as also how his Companion had undertaken to plead Antonia's
            cause with the Marquis de las Cisternas. Elvira received this intelligence
            with sensations very different from those with which it was communicated. She
            blamed her Sister's imprudence in confiding her history to an absolute
            Stranger, and expressed her fears, lest this inconsiderate step should
            prejudice the Marquis against her. The greatest of her apprehensions She
            concealed in her own breast. She had observed with inquietude, that at the
            mention of Lorenzo a deep blush spread itself over her Daughter's cheek. The
            timid Antonia dared not to pronounce his name: Without knowing wherefore, She
            felt embarrassed when He was made the subject of discourse, and endeavoured to
            change the conversation to Ambrosio. Elvira perceived the emotions of this
            young bosom: In consequence, She <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0152" n="139"
            />insisted upon Leonella's breaking her promise to the Cavaliers. A sigh,
            which on hearing this order escaped from Antonia, confirmed the wary Mother in
            her resolution. </p>
          <p>Through this resolution Leonella was determined to break: She conceived it to
            be inspired by envy, and that her Sister dreaded her being elevated above her.
            Without imparting her design to any one, She took an opportunity of
            dispatching the following note to Lorenzo; It was delivered to him as soon as
            He woke.</p>
          <lb/>
          <p>`Doubtless, Segnor Don Lorenzo, you have frequently accused me of ingratitude
            and forgetfulness: But on the word of a Virgin, it was out of my power to
            perform my promise yesterday. I know not in what words to inform you, how
            strange a reception my Sister gave your kind wish to visit her. She is an odd
            Woman, with many good points about her; But her jealousy of me frequently
            makes her conceive notions quite unaccountable. On hearing that your Friend
              <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0153" n="140"/>had paid some little attention to
            me, She immediately took the alarm: She blamed my conduct, and has absolutely
            forbidden me to let you know our abode. My strong sense of gratitude for your
            kind offers of service, and . . . Shall I confess it? my desire to behold once
            more the too amiable Don Christoval, will not permit my obeying her
            injunctions. I have therefore stolen a moment to inform you, that we lodge in
            the Strada di San Iago, four doors from the Palace d'Albornos, and nearly
            opposite to the Barber's Miguel Coello. Enquire for Donna Elvira Dalfa, since
            in compliance with her Father-in-law's order, my Sister continues to be called
            by her maiden name. At eight this evening you will be sure of finding us: But
            let not a word drop, which may raise a suspicion of my having written this
            letter. Should you see the Cond&eacute; d'Ossorio, tell him . . . I blush
            while I declare it . . . Tell him that his presence will be but too acceptable
            to the sympathetic<lb/> Leonella.</p>
          <lb/>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0154" n="141"/>The latter sentences were written
            in red ink, to express the blushes of her cheek, while She committed an
            outrage upon her virgin modesty. </p>
          <p>Lorenzo had no sooner perused this note, than He set out in search of Don
            Christoval. Not being able to find him in the course of the day, He proceeded
            to Donna Elvira's alone to Leonella's infinite disappointment. The Domestic,
            by whom He sent up his name, having already declared his Lady to be at home,
            She had no excuse for refusing his visit: Yet She consented to receive it with
            much reluctance. That reluctance was increased by the changes which his
            approach produced in Antonia's countenance; nor was it by any means abated,
            when the Youth himself appeared. The symmetry of his person, animation of his
            features, and natural elegance of his manners and address, convinced Elvira
            that such a Guest must be dangerous for her Daughter. She resolved to treat
            him with distant politeness, to decline his <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0155"
              n="142"/> services with gratitude for the tender of them, and to make him
            feel, without offence, that his future visits would be far from acceptable. </p>
          <p>On his entrance He found Elvira who was indisposed, reclining upon a Sopha:
            Antonia sat by her embroidery frame, and Leonella; in a pastoral dress, held
              `<hi rend="italic">Montemayor's Diana</hi>.' In spite of her being the
            Mother of Antonia, Lorenzo could not help expecting to find in Elvira
            Leonella's true Sister, and the Daughter of `as honest a pains-taking
            Shoe-maker, as any in Cordova.' A single glance was sufficient to undeceive
            him. He beheld a Woman whose features, though impaired by time and sorrow,
            still bore the marks of distinguished beauty: A serious dignity reigned upon
            her countenance, but was tempered by a grace and sweetness which rendered her
            truly enchanting. Lorenzo fancied that She must have resembled her Daughter in
            her youth, and readily excused the imprudence of the late Cond&eacute; de
            las Cisternas. She desired him <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0156" n="143"/>to be
            seated, and immediately resumed her place upon the Sopha. </p>
          <p>Antonia received him with a simple reverence, and continued her work: Her
            cheeks were suffused with crimson, and She strove to conceal her emotion by
            leaning over her embroidery frame. Her Aunt also chose to play off her airs of
            modesty; She affected to blush and tremble, and waited with her eyes cast down
            to receive, as She expected, the compliments of Don Christoval. Finding after
            some time that no sign of his approach was given, She ventured to look round
            the room, and perceived with vexation that Medina was unaccompanied.
            Impatience would not permit her waiting for an explanation: Interrupting
            Lorenzo, who was delivering Raymond's message, She desired to know what was
            become of his Friend. </p>
          <p>He, who thought it necessary to maintain himself in her good graces, strove
            to console her under her disappointment by committing a little violence upon
            truth. </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0157" n="144"/>`Ah! Segnora,' He replied in a
            melancholy voice `How grieved will He be at losing this opportunity of paying
            you his respects! A Relation's illness has obliged him to quit Madrid in
            haste: But on his return, He will doubtless seize the first moment with
            transport to throw himself at your feet!' </p>
          <p>As He said this, his eyes met those of Elvira: She punished his falsehood
            sufficiently by darting at him a look expressive of displeasure and reproach.
            Neither did the deceit answer his intention. Vexed and disappointed Leonella
            rose from her seat, and retired in dudgeon to her own apartment. </p>
          <p>Lorenzo hastened to repair the fault, which had injured him in Elvira's
            opinion. He related his conversation with the Marquis respecting her: He
            assured her that Raymond was prepared to acknowledge her for his Brother's
            Widow; and that till it was in his power to pay his compliments to her in
            person, Lorenzo was commissioned <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0158" n="145"/> to
            supply his place. This intelligence relieved Elvira from an heavy weight of
            uneasiness: She had now found a Protector for the fatherless Antonia, for
            whose future fortunes She had suffered the greatest apprehensions. She was not
            sparing of her thanks to him, who had interfered so generously in her behalf;
            But still She gave him no invitation to repeat his visit. However, when upon
            rising to depart He requested permission to enquire after her health
            occasionally, the polite earnestness of his manner, gratitude for his
            services, and respect for his Friend the Marquis, would not admit of a
            refusal. She consented reluctantly to receive him: He promised not to abuse
            her goodness, and quitted the House. </p>
          <p>Antonia was now left alone with her Mother: A temporary silence ensued. Both
            wished to speak upon the same subject, but Neither knew how to introduce it.
            The one felt a bashfulness which sealed up her lips, and for which She could
            not account: The other feared to find her apprehensions true, <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0159" n="146"/>or to inspire her Daughter with
            notions to which She might be still a Stranger. At length Elvira began the
            conversation. </p>
          <p>`That is a charming young Man, Antonia; I am much pleased with him. Was He
            long near you yesterday in the Cathedral?' </p>
          <p>`He quitted me not for a moment while I staid in the Church: He gave me his
            seat, and was very obliging and attentive.' </p>
          <p>`Indeed? Why then have you never mentioned his name to me? Your Aunt lanched
            out in praise of his Friend, and you vaunted Ambrosio's eloquence: But Neither
            said a word of Don Lorenzo's person and accomplishments. Had not Leonella
            spoken of his readiness to undertake our cause, I should not have known him to
            be in existence.' </p>
          <p>She paused. Antonia coloured, but was silent. </p>
          <p>`Perhaps you judge him less favourably than I do. In my opinion his figure is
            pleasing, his conversation sensible, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0160"
              n="147"/>manners engaging. Still He may have struck you differently: You may
            think him disagreeable, and . . .'. </p>
          <p>`Disagreeable? Oh! dear Mother, how should I possibly think him so? I should
            be very ungrateful, were I not sensible of his kindness yesterday, and very
            blind if his merits had escaped me. His figure is so graceful, so noble! His
            manners so gentle, yet so manly! I never yet saw so many accomplishments
            united in one person, and I doubt whether Madrid can produce his equal.' </p>
          <p>`Why then were you so silent in praise of this Ph&oelig;nix of Madrid?
            Why was it concealed from me, that his society had afforded you pleasure?' </p>
          <p>`In truth, I know not: You ask me a question, which I cannot resolve myself.
            I was on the point of mentioning him a thousand times: His name was constantly
            upon my lips, but when I would have pronounced it, I wanted courage to execute
            my design. <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0161" n="148"/>However, if I did not
            speak of him, it was not that I thought of him the less.' </p>
          <p>`That I believe; But shall I tell you why you wanted courage? It was because
            accustomed to confide to me your most secret thoughts, you knew not how to
            conceal, yet feared to acknowledge, that your heart nourished a sentiment,
            which you were conscious I should disapprove. Come hither to me, my Child.' </p>
          <p>Antonia quitted her embroidery frame, threw herself upon her knees by the
            Sopha, and hid her face in her Mother's lap. </p>
          <p>`Fear not, my sweet Girl! Consider me equally as your Friend and Parent, and
            apprehend no reproof from me. I have read the emotions of your bosom; you are
            yet ill skilled in concealing them, and they could not escape my attentive
            eye. This Lorenzo is dangerous to your repose; He has already made an
            impression upon your heart. 'Tis true, that I perceive easily that your
            affection is returned; But what can be <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0162"
              n="149"/>the consequences of this attachment? You are poor and friendless,
            my Antonia; Lorenzo is the Heir of the Duke of Medina Celi. Even should
            Himself mean honourably, his Uncle never will consent to your union; Nor
            without that Uncle's consent, will I. By sad experience I know what sorrows
            She must endure, who marries into a family unwilling to receive her. Then
            struggle with your affection: Whatever pains it may cost you, strive to
            conquer it. Your heart is tender and susceptible: It has already received a
            strong impression; But when once convinced that you should not encourage such
            sentiments, I trust, that you have sufficient fortitude to drive them from
            your bosom.' </p>
          <p>Antonia kissed her hand, and promised implicit obedience. Elvira then
            continued. </p>
          <p>`To prevent your passion from growing stronger, it will be needful to
            prohibit Lorenzo's visits. The service which He has rendered me permits not my
            forbidding <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0163" n="150"/>them positively; But
            unless I judge too favourably of his character, He will discontinue them
            without taking offence, if I confess to him my reasons, and throw myself
            entirely on his generosity. The next time that I see him, I will honestly avow
            to him the embarrassment which his presence occasions. How say you, my Child?
            Is not this measure necessary?' </p>
          <p>Antonia subscribed to every thing without hesitation, though not without
            regret. Her Mother kissed her affectionately, and retired to bed. Antonia
            followed her example, and vowed so frequently never more to think of Lorenzo,
            that till Sleep closed her eyes She thought of nothing else. </p>
          <p>While this was passing at Elvira's, Lorenzo hastened to rejoin the Marquis.
            Every thing was ready for the second elopement of Agnes; and at twelve the two
            Friends with a Coach and four were at the Garden-wall of the Convent. Don
            Raymond drew out his Key, and unlocked the <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0164"
              n="151"/> door. They entered, and waited for some time in expectation of
            being joined by Agnes. At length the Marquis grew impatient: Beginning to fear
            that his second attempt would succeed no better than the first, He proposed to
            reconnoitre the Convent. The Friends advanced towards it. Every thing was
            still and dark. The Prioress was anxious to keep the story a secret, fearing
            lest the crime of one of its members should bring disgrace upon the whole
            community, or that the interposition of powerful Relations should deprive her
            vengeance of its intended victim. She took care therefore to give the Lover of
            Agnes no cause to suppose, that his design was discovered, and his Mistress on
            the point of suffering the punishment of her fault. The same reason made her
            reject the idea of arresting the unknown Seducer in the Garden; Such a
            proceeding would have created much disturbance, and the disgrace of her
            Convent would have been noised about Madrid. She contented herself with
            confining Agnes closely; As to the <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0165" n="152"
            />Lover She left him at liberty to pursue his designs. What She had expected
            was the result. The Marquis and Lorenzo waited in vain till the break of day:
            They then retired without noise, alarmed at the failure of their plan, and
            ignorant of the cause of its ill-success. </p>
          <p>The next morning Lorenzo went to the Convent, and requested to see his
            Sister. The Prioress appeared at the Grate with a melancholy countenance: She
            informed him that for several days Agnes had appeared much agitated; That She
            had been prest by the Nuns in vain to reveal the cause, and apply to their
            tenderness for advice and consolation; That She had obstinately persisted in
            concealing the cause of her distress; But that on Thursday Evening it had
            produced so violent an effect upon her constitution, that She had fallen ill,
            and was actually confined to her bed. Lorenzo did not credit a syllable of
            this account: He insisted upon seeing his Sister; If She was unable to come to
            the Grate, He desired to <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0166" n="153"/>be admitted
            to her Cell. The Prioress crossed herself! She was shocked at the very idea of
            a Man's profane eye pervading the interior of her holy Mansion, and professed
            herself astonished that Lorenzo could think of such a thing. She told him that
            his request could not be granted; But that if He returned the next day, She
            hoped that her beloved Daughter would then be sufficiently recovered to join
            him at the Parlour-grate. With this answer Lorenzo was obliged to retire,
            unsatisfied and trembling for his Sister's safety. </p>
          <p>He returned the next morning at an early hour. `Agnes was worse; The
            Physician had pronounced her to be in imminent danger; She was ordered to
            remain quiet, and it was utterly impossible for her to receive her Brother's
            visit.' Lorenzo stormed at this answer, but there was no resource. He raved,
            He entreated, He threatened: No means were left untried to obtain a sight of
            Agnes. His endeavours were as fruitless as those of the day before, and He
            returned in <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0167" n="154"/>despair to the Marquis.
            On his side, the Latter had spared no pains to discover what had occasioned
            his plot to fail: Don Christoval to whom the affair was now entrusted,
            endeavoured to worm out the secret from the Old Porteress of St. Clare, with
            whom He had formed an acquaintance; But She was too much upon her guard, and
            He gained from her no intelligence. The Marquis was almost distracted, and
            Lorenzo felt scarcely less inquietude. Both were convinced, that the purposed
            elopement must have been discovered: They doubted not but the malady of Agnes
            was a pretence, But they knew not by what means to rescue her from the hands
            of the Prioress. </p>
          <p>Regularly every day did Lorenzo visit the Convent: As regularly was He
            informed that his Sister rather grew worse than better. Certain that her
            indisposition was feigned, these accounts did not alarm him: But his ignorance
            of her fate, and of the motives which induced the Prioress to keep <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0168" n="155"/>her from him, excited the most serious
            uneasiness. He was still uncertain what steps He ought to take, when the
            Marquis received a letter from the Cardinal-Duke of Lerma. It inclosed the
            Pope's expected Bull, ordering that Agnes should be released from her vows,
            and restored to her Relations. This essential paper decided at once the
            proceedings of her Friends: They resolved that Lorenzo should carry it to the
            Domina without delay, and demand that his Sister should be instantly given up
            to him. Against this mandate illness could not be pleaded: It gave her Brother
            the power of removing her instantly to the Palace de Medina, and He determined
            to use that power on the following day. </p>
          <p>His mind relieved from inquietude respecting his Sister, and his Spirits
            raised by the hope of soon restoring her to freedom, He now had time to give a
            few moments to love and to Antonia. At the same hour as on his former visit He
            repaired to Donna Elvira's: She had given orders for his <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0169" n="156"/>admission. As soon as He was
            announced, her Daughter retired with Leonella, and when He entered the
            chamber, He found the Lady of the House alone. She received him with less
            distance than before, and desired him to place himself near her upon the
            Sopha. She then without losing time opened her business, as had been agreed
            between herself and Antonia. </p>
          <p>`You must not think me ungrateful, Don Lorenzo, or forgetful how essential
            are the services, which you have rendered me with the Marquis. I feel the
            weight of my obligations; Nothing under the Sun should induce my taking the
            step to which I am now compelled, but the interest of my Child, of my beloved
            Antonia. My health is declining; God only knows, how soon I may be summoned
            before his Throne. My Daughter will be left without Parents, and should She
            lose the protection of the Cisternas family, without Friends. She is young and
            artless, uninstructed in the world's perfidy, and with charms sufficient to
            render <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0170" n="157"/>her an object of seduction.
            Judge then, how I must tremble at the prospect before her! Judge, how anxious
            I must be to keep her from their society, who may excite the yet dormant
            passions of her bosom. You are amiable, Don Lorenzo: Antonia has a
            susceptible, a loving heart, and is grateful for the favours conferred upon us
            by your interference with the Marquis. Your presence makes me tremble: I fear,
            lest it should inspire her with sentiments which may embitter the remainder of
            her life, or encourage her to cherish hopes in her situation unjustifiable and
            futile. Pardon me, when I avow my terrors, and let my frankness plead in my
            excuse. I cannot forbid you my House, for gratitude restrains me; I can only
            throw myself upon your generosity, and entreat you to spare the feelings of an
            anxious, of a doting Mother. Believe me when I assure you, that I lament the
            necessity of rejecting your acquaintance; But there is no remedy, and
            Antonia's interest obliges me to beg you to forbear your <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0171" n="158"/>visits. By complying with my request,
            you will increase the esteem which I already feel for you, and of which every
            thing convinces me, that you are truly deserving.' </p>
          <p>`Your frankness charms me,' replied Lorenzo; `You shall find, that in your
            favourable opinion of me you were not deceived. Yet I hope, that the reasons
            now in my power to allege, will persuade you to withdraw a request, which I
            cannot obey without infinite reluctance. I love your Daughter, love her most
            sincerely: I wish for no greater happiness than to inspire her with the same
            sentiments, and receive her hand at the Altar as her Husband. 'Tis true, I am
            not rich myself; My Father's death has left me but little in my own
            possession; But my expectations justify my pretending to the Cond&eacute;
            de las Cisternas' Daughter.' </p>
          <p>He was proceeding, but Elvira interrupted him. </p>
          <p>`Ah! Don Lorenzo, you forget in that pompous title the meanness of my origin.
              <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0172" n="158"/>You forget, that I have now past
            fourteen years in Spain, disavowed by my Husband's family, and existing upon a
            stipend barely sufficient for the support and education of my Daughter. Nay, I
            have even been neglected by most of my own Relations, who out of envy affect
            to doubt the reality of my marriage. My allowance being dis-continued at my
            Father-in-law's death, I was reduced to the very brink of want. In this
            situation I was found by my Sister, who amongst all her foibles possesses a
            warm, generous, and affectionate heart. She aided me with the little fortune
            which my Father left her, persuaded me to visit Madrid, and has supported my
            Child and myself since our quitting Murcia. Then consider not Antonia as
            descended from the Cond&eacute; de la Cisternas: Consider her as a poor
            and unprotected Orphan, as the Grand-child of the Tradesman Torribio Dalfa, as
            the needy Pensioner of that Tradesman's Daughter. Reflect upon the difference
            between such a situation, and that of the Nephew and Heir of the potent <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0173" n="160"/>Duke of Medina. I believe your
            intentions to be honourable; But as there are no hopes that your Uncle will
            approve of the union, I fore-see that the consequences of your attachment must
            be fatal to my Child's repose.' </p>
          <p>`Pardon me, Segnora; You are mis-informed if you suppose the Duke of Medina
            to resemble the generality of Men. His sentiments are liberal and
            disinterested: He loves me well; and I have no reason to dread his forbidding
            the marriage, when He perceives that my happiness depends upon Antonia. But
            supposing him to refuse his sanction, what have I still to fear? My Parents
            are no more; My little fortune is in my own possession: It will be sufficient
            to support Antonia, and I shall exchange for her hand Medina's Dukedom without
            one sigh of regret.' </p>
          <p>`You are young and eager; It is natural for you to entertain such ideas. But
            Experience has taught me to my cost, that curses accompany an unequal
            alliance. I married <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0174" n="161"/>the
            Cond&eacute; de las Cisternas in opposition to the will of his Relations;
            Many an heart-pang has punished me for the imprudent step. Where-ever we bent
            our course, a Father's execration pursued Gonzalvo. Poverty over-took us, and
            no Friend was near to relieve our wants. Still our mutual affection existed,
            but alas! not without interruption. Accustomed to wealth and ease, ill could
            my Husband support the transition to distress and indigence. He looked back
            with repining to the comforts which He once enjoyed. He regretted the
            situation which for my sake He had quitted; and in moments when Despair
            possessed his mind, has reproached me with having made him the Companion of
            want and wretchedness! He has called me his bane! The source of his sorrows,
            the cause of his destruction! Ah God! He little knew, how much keener were my
            own heart's reproaches! He was ignorant that I suffered trebly, for myself,
            for my Children, and for him! 'Tis true that <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0175"
              n="162"/>his anger seldom lasted long: His sincere affection for me soon
            revived in his heart; and then his repentance for the tears which He had made
            me shed, tortured me even more than his reproaches. He would throw himself on
            the ground, implore my forgiveness in the most frantic terms, and load himself
            with curses for being the Murderer of my repose. Taught by experience that an
            union contracted against the inclinations of families on either side must be
            unfortunate, I will save my Daughter from those miseries, which I have
            suffered. Without your Uncle's consent, while I live, She never shall be
            yours. Undoubtedly He will disapprove of the union; His power is immense, and
            Antonia shall not be exposed to his anger and persecution.' </p>
          <p>`His persecution? How easily may that be avoided! Let the worst happen, it is
            but quitting Spain. My wealth may easily be realised; The Indian Islands will
            offer us a secure retreat; I have an estate, though <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0176" n="163"/>not of value, in Hispaniola: Thither
            will we fly, and I shall consider it to be my native Country, if it gives me
            Antonia's undisturbed possession.' </p>
          <p>`Ah! Youth, this is a fond romantic vision. Gonzalvo thought the same. He
            fancied, that He could leave Spain without regret; But the moment of parting
            undeceived him. You know not yet what it is to quit your native land; to quit
            it, never to behold it more! You know not, what it is to exchange the scenes
            where you have passed your infancy, for unknown realms and barbarous climates!
            To be forgotten, utterly eternally forgotten by the Companions of your Youth!
            To see your dearest Friends, the fondest objects of your affection, perishing
            with diseases incidental to Indian atmospheres, and find yourself unable to
            procure for them necessary assistance! I have felt all this! My Husband and
            two sweet Babes found their Graves in Cuba: Nothing would have saved my young
            Antonia but my sudden return to Spain. Ah! <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0177"
              n="164"/> Don Lorenzo, could you conceive what I suffered during my absence!
            Could you know, how sorely I regretted all that I left behind, and how dear to
            me was the very name of Spain! I envied the winds which blew towards it: And
            when the Spanish Sailor chaunted some well-known air as He past my window,
            tears filled my eyes, while I thought upon my native land. Gonzalvo too . . .
            My Husband . . .'. </p>
          <p>Elvira paused. Her voice faltered, and She concealed her face with her
            hand-kerchief. After a short silence She rose from the Sopha, and proceeded. </p>
          <p>`Excuse my quitting you for a few moments: The remembrance of what I have
            suffered has much agitated me, and I need to be alone. Till I return peruse
            these lines. After my Husband's death I found them among his papers; Had I
            known sooner that He entertained such sentiments, Grief would have killed me.
            He wrote these verses on his voyage to Cuba, when his mind was clouded by
            sorrow, and He forgot that <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0178" n="165"/>He had a
            Wife and Children. What we are losing, ever seems to us the most precious:
            Gonzalvo was quitting Spain for ever, and therefore was Spain dearer to his
            eyes, than all else which the World contained. Read them, Don Lorenzo; They
            will give you some idea of the feelings of a banished Man!' </p>
          <p>Elvira put a paper into Lorenzo's hand, and retired from the chamber. The
            Youth examined the contents, and found them to be as follows.</p>

          <p>Lorenzo had scarcely time to read these lines, when Elvira returned to him:
            The giving a free course to her tears had relieved her, and her spirits had
            regained their usual composure. </p>
          <p>`I have nothing more to say, my Lord,' said She; `You have heard my
            apprehensions, and my reasons for begging you not to repeat your visits. I
            have thrown myself in full confidence upon your honour: I am certain, that you
            will not prove my opinion of you to have been too favourable.' </p>
          <p>`But one question more, Segnora, and I leave you. Should the Duke of Medina
              <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0182" n="169"/>approve my love, would my
            addresses be unacceptable to yourself and the fair Antonia?' </p>
          <p>`I will be open with you, Don Lorenzo: There being little probability of such
            an union taking place, I fear that it is desired but too ardently by my
            Daughter. You have made an impression upon her young heart, which gives me the
            most serious alarm: To prevent that impression from growing stronger, I am
            obliged to decline your acquaintance. For me, you may be sure, that I should
            rejoice at establishing my Child so advantageously. Conscious that my
            constitution, impaired by grief and illness, forbids me to expect a long
            continuance in this world, I tremble at the thought of leaving her under the
            protection of a perfect Stranger. The Marquis de las Cisternas is totally
            unknown to me: He will marry; His Lady may look upon Antonia with an eye of
            displeasure, and deprive her of her only Friend. Should the Duke, your Uncle,
            give his <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0183" n="170"/>consent, you need not doubt
            obtaining mine and my Daughter's: But without his, hope not for ours. At all
            events, what ever steps you may take, what ever may be the Duke's decision,
            till you know it let me beg your forbearing to strengthen by your presence
            Antonia's prepossession. If the sanction of your Relations authorises your
            addressing her as your Wife, my Doors fly open to you: If that sanction is
            refused, be satisfied to possess my esteem and gratitude, but remember, that
            we must meet no more.' </p>
          <p>Lorenzo promised reluctantly to conform to this decree: But He added that He
            hoped soon to obtain that consent, which would give him a claim to the renewal
            of their acquaintance. He then explained to her why the Marquis had not called
            in person, and made no scruple of confiding to her his Sister's History. He
            concluded by saying, that He hoped to set Agnes at liberty the next day; and
            that as soon as Don Raymond's fears were quieted upon this subject, <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0184" n="171"/>He would lose no time in assuring
            Donna Elvira of his friendship and protection. </p>
          <p>The Lady shook her head. </p>
          <p>`I tremble for your Sister,' said She; `I have heard many traits of the
            Domina of St. Clare's character, from a Friend who was educated in the same
            Convent with her. She reported her to be haughty, inflexible, superstitious,
            and revengeful. I have since heard, that She is infatuated with the idea of
            rendering her Convent the most regular in Madrid, and never forgave those
            whose imprudence threw upon it the slightest stain. Though naturally violent
            and severe, when her interests require it, She well knows how to assume an
            appearance of benignity. She leaves no means untried to persuade young Women
            of rank to become Members of her Community: She is implacable when once
            incensed, and has too much intrepidity to shrink at taking the most rigorous
            measures for punishing the Offender. Doubtless, She will consider your
            Sister's quitting the <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0185" n="172"/>Convent, as a
            disgrace thrown upon it: She will use every artifice to avoid obeying the
            mandate of his Holiness, and I shudder to think, that Donna Agnes is in the
            hands of this dangerous Woman.' </p>
          <p>Lorenzo now rose to take leave. Elvira gave him her hand at parting, which He
            kissed respectfully; and telling her that He soon hoped for the permission to
            salute that of Antonia, He returned to his Hotel. The Lady was perfectly
            satisfied with the conversation, which had past between them. She looked
            forward with satisfaction to the prospect of his becoming her Son-in- law; But
            Prudence bad her conceal from her Daughter's knowledge, the flattering hopes
            which Herself now ventured to entertain. </p>
          <p>Scarcely was it day, and already Lorenzo was at the Convent of St. Clare,
            furnished with the necessary mandate. The Nuns were at Matins. He waited
            impatiently for the conclusion of the service, and at length the Prioress
            appeared at the Parlour-Grate. <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0186" n="173"/>Agnes
            was demanded. The old Lady replied with a melancholy air, that the dear
            Child's situation grew hourly more dangerous; That the Physicians despaired of
            her life; But that they had declared, the only chance for her recovery to
            consist in keeping her quiet, and not to permit those to approach her whose
            presence was likely to agitate her. Not a word of all this was believed by
            Lorenzo, any more than He credited the expressions of grief and affection for
            Agnes, with which this account was interlarded. To end the business, He put
            the Pope's Bull into the hands of the Domina, and insisted, that ill or in
            health his Sister should be delivered to him without delay. </p>
          <p>The Prioress received the paper with an air of humility: But no sooner had
            her eye glanced over the contents, than her resentment baffled all the efforts
            of Hypocrisy. A deep crimson spread itself over her face, and She darted upon
            Lorenzo looks of rage and menace. </p>
          <p>`This order is positive,' said She in a <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0187"
              n="174"/>voice of anger, which She in vain strove to disguise; `Willingly
            would I obey it; But unfortunately it is out of my power.' </p>
          <p>Lorenzo interrupted her by an exclamation of surprize. </p>
          <p>`I repeat it, Segnor; to obey this order is totally out of my power. From
            tenderness to a Brother's feelings, I would have communicated the sad event to
            you by degrees, and have prepared you to hear it with fortitude. My measures
            are broken through: This order commands me to deliver up to you the Sister
            Agnes without delay; I am therefore obliged to inform you without
            circumlocution, that on Friday last She expired.' </p>
          <p>Lorenzo started back with horror, and turned pale. A moment's recollection
            convinced him, that this assertion must be false, and it restored him to
            himself. </p>
          <p>`You deceive me!' said He passionately; `But five minutes past since you
            assured me, that though ill She was still alive. Produce her this instant! See
            her I must and <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0188" n="175"/>will, and every
            attempt to keep her from me will be unavailing.' </p>
          <p>`You forget yourself, Segnor; You owe respect to my age as well as my
            profession. Your Sister is no more. If I at first concealed her death, it was
            from dreading, lest an event so unexpected should produce on you too violent
            an effect. In truth, I am but ill repaid for my attention. And what interest,
            I pray you, should I have in detaining her? To know her wish of quitting our
            society is a sufficient reason for me to wish her absence, and think her a
            disgrace to the Sister-hood of St. Clare: But She has forfeited my affection
            in a manner yet more culpable. Her crimes were great, and when you know the
            cause of her death, you will doubtless rejoice, Don Lorenzo, that such a
            Wretch is no longer in existence. She was taken ill on Thursday last on
            returning from confession in the Capuchin-Chapel. Her malady seemed attended
            with strange circumstances; But She persisted in concealing its cause: Thanks
            to the Virgin, <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0189" n="176"/>we were too ignorant
            to suspect it! Judge then what must have been our consternation, our horror,
            when She was delivered the next day of a still-born Child, whom She
            immediately followed to the Grave. How, Segnor? Is it possible, that your
            countenance expresses no surprize, no indignation? Is it possible, that your
            Sister's infamy was known to you, and that still She possessed your affection?
            In that case, you have no need of my compassion. I can say nothing more,
            except repeat my inability of obeying the orders of his Holiness. Agnes is no
            more, and to convince you that what I say is true, I swear by our blessed
            Saviour, that three days have past since She was buried.' </p>
          <p>Here She kissed a small crucifix, which hung at her girdle. She then rose
            from her chair, and quitted the Parlour. As She withdrew, She cast upon
            Lorenzo a scornful smile. </p>
          <p>`Farewell, Segnor,' said She; `I know no remedy for this accident: I fear
            that even a second Bull from the Pope will not procure your Sister's
            resurrection.' </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0190" n="177"/>Lorenzo also retired, penetrated
            with affliction: But Don Raymond's at the news of this event amounted to
            Madness. He would not be convinced that Agnes was really dead, and continued
            to insist, that the Walls of St. Clare still confined her. No arguments could
            make him abandon his hopes of regaining her: Every day some fresh scheme was
            invented for procuring intelligence of her, and all of them were attended with
            the same success. </p>
          <p>On his part, Medina gave up the idea of ever seeing his Sister more: Yet He
            believed, that She had been taken off by unfair means. Under this persuasion,
            He encouraged Don Raymond's researches, determined, should He discover the
            least warrant for his suspicions, to take a severe vengeance upon the
            unfeeling Prioress. The loss of his Sister affected him sincerely; Nor was it
            the least cause of his distress, that propriety obliged him for some time to
            defer mentioning Antonia to the Duke. In the mean while his emissaries
            constantly surrounded Elvira's <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0191" n="178"/>Door.
            He had intelligence of all the movements of his Mistress: As She never failed
            every Thursday to attend the Sermon in the Capuchin Cathedral, He was secure
            of seeing her once a week, though in compliance with his promise, He carefully
            shunned her observation. Thus two long Months passed away. Still no
            information was procured of Agnes: All but the Marquis credited her death; and
            now Lorenzo determined to disclose his sentiments to his Uncle. He had already
            dropt some hints of his intention to marry; They had been as favourably
            received as He could expect, and He harboured no doubt of the success of his
            application.</p>

          <p>THE BURST OF transport was past: Ambrosio's lust was satisfied; Pleasure
            fled, and Shame usurped her seat in his bosom. Confused and terrified at his
            weakness He drew himself from Matilda's arms. His perjury presented itself
            before him: He reflected on the scene which had just been acted, and trembled
            at the consequences of a discovery. He looked forward with horror; His heart
            was despondent, and became the abode of satiety and disgust. He avoided the
            eyes of his Partner in frailty; A melancholy silence prevailed, during which
            Both seemed busied with disagreable reflections. </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0193" n="180"/>Matilda was the first to break it.
            She took his hand gently, and pressed it to her burning lips. </p>
          <p>`Ambrosio!' She murmured in a soft and trembling voice. </p>
          <p>The Abbot started at the sound. He turned his eyes upon Matilda's: They were
            filled with tears; Her cheeks were covered with blushes, and her supplicating
            looks seemed to solicit his compassion. </p>
          <p>`Dangerous Woman!' said He; `Into what an abyss of misery have you plunged
            me! Should your sex be discovered, my honour, nay my life, must pay for the
            pleasure of a few moments. Fool that I was, to trust myself to your
            seductions! What can now be done? How can my offence be expiated? What
            atonement can purchase the pardon of my crime? Wretched Matilda, you have
            destroyed my quiet for ever!' </p>
          <p>`To me these reproaches, Ambrosio? To me, who have sacrificed for you the
            world's pleasures, the luxury of wealth, the <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0194"
              n="181"/>delicacy of sex, my Friends, my fortune, and my fame? What have you
            lost, which I preserved? Have <hi rend="italic">I</hi> not shared in <hi
              rend="italic">your</hi> guilt? Have <hi rend="italic">you</hi> not shared in
              <hi rend="italic">my</hi> pleasure? Guilt, did I say? In what consists ours,
            unless in the opinion of an ill-judging World? Let that World be ignorant of
            them, and our joys become divine and blameless! Unnatural were your vows of
            Celibacy; Man was not created for such a state; And were Love a crime, God
            never would have made it so sweet, so irresistible! Then banish those clouds
            from your brow, my Ambrosio! Indulge in those pleasures freely, without which
            life is a worthless gift: Cease to reproach me with having taught you, what is
            bliss, and feel equal transports with the Woman who adores you!' </p>
          <p>As She spoke, her eyes were filled with a delicious languor. Her bosom
            panted: She twined her arms voluptuously round him, drew him towards her, and
            glewed her lips to his. Ambrosio again raged with desire: The die was thrown:
            His vows were already <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0195" n="182"/> broken; He
            had already committed the crime, and why should He refrain from enjoying its
            reward? He clasped her to his breast with redoubled ardour. No longer
            repressed by the sense of shame, He gave a loose to his intemperate appetites:
            While the fair Wanton put every invention of lust in practice, every
            refinement in the art of pleasure, which might heighten the bliss of her
            possession, and render her Lover's transports still more exquisite. Ambrosio
            rioted in delights till then unknown to him: Swift fled the night, and the
            Morning blushed to behold him still clasped in the embraces of Matilda. </p>
          <p>Intoxicated with pleasure, the Monk rose from the Syren's luxurious Couch. He
            no longer reflected with shame upon his incontinence, or dreaded the vengeance
            of offended heaven. His only fear was, lest Death should rob him of
            enjoyments, for which his long Fast had only given a keener edge to his
            appetite. Matilda was still under the influence of poison, and the voluptuous
            Monk trembled less for his Preserver's life than his <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0196" n="183"/>Concubine's. Deprived of her, He would
            not easily find another Mistress, with whom He could indulge his passions so
            fully, and so safely. He therefore pressed her with earnestness to use the
            means of preservation, which She had declared to be in her possession. </p>
          <p>`Yes!' replied Matilda; `Since you have made me feel that Life is valuable, I
            will rescue mine at any rate. No dangers shall appall me: I will look upon the
            consequences of my action boldly, nor shudder at the horrors which they
            present. I will think my sacrifice scarcely worthy to purchase your
            possession, and remember, that a moment past in your arms in this world,
            o'er-pays an age of punishment in the next. But before I take this step,
            Ambrosio, give me your solemn oath never to enquire, by what means I shall
            preserve myself.' </p>
          <p>He did so in a manner the most binding. </p>
          <p>`I thank you, my Beloved. This precaution is necessary, for though you know
              <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0197" n="184"/>it not, you are under the command
            of vulgar prejudices: The Business on which I must be employed this night,
            might startle you from its singularity, and lower me in your opinion. Tell me;
            Are you possessed of the Key of the low door on the western side of the
            Garden?' </p>
          <p>`The Door which opens into the burying-ground common to us and the
            Sister-hood of St. Clare? I have not the Key, but can easily procure it.' </p>
          <p>`You have only this to do. Admit me into the burying- ground at midnight;
            Watch while I descend into the vaults of St. Clare, lest some prying eye
            should observe my actions; Leave me there alone for an hour, and that life is
            safe, which I dedicate to your pleasures. To prevent creating suspicion do not
            visit me during the day. Remember the Key, and that I expect you before
            twelve. Hark! I hear steps approaching! Leave me; I will pretend to sleep.' </p>
          <p>The Friar obeyed, and left the Cell. As <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0198"
              n="185"/>He opened the door, Father Pablos made his appearance. </p>
          <p>`I come,' said the Latter `to enquire after the health of my young Patient.' </p>
          <p>`Hush!' replied Ambrosio, laying his finger upon his lip; `Speak softly; I am
            just come from him. He has fallen into a profound slumber, which doubtless
            will be of service to him. Do not disturb him at present, for He wishes to
            repose.' </p>
          <p>Father Pablos obeyed, and hearing the Bell ring, accompanied the Abbot to
            Matins. Ambrosio felt embarrassed, as He entered the Chapel. Guilt was new to
            him, and He fancied that every eye could read the transactions of the night
            upon his countenance. He strove to pray; His bosom no longer glowed with
            devotion; His thoughts insensibly wandered to Matilda's secret charms. But
            what He wanted in purity of heart, He supplied by exterior sanctity. The
            better to cloak his transgression, He redoubled his pretensions to the
            semblance of virtue, and never appeared more devoted to Heaven <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0199" n="186"/>than since He had broken through his
            engagements. Thus did He unconsciously add Hypocrisy to perjury and
            incontinence; He had fallen into the latter errors from yielding to seduction
            almost irresistible; But he was now guilty of a voluntary fault by
            endeavouring to conceal those, into which Another had betrayed him. </p>
          <p>The Matins concluded, Ambrosio retired to his Cell. The pleasures which He
            had just tasted for the first time were still impressed upon his mind. His
            brain was bewildered, and presented a confused Chaos of remorse,
            voluptuousness, inquietude, and fear. He looked back with regret to that peace
            of soul, that security of virtue, which till then had been his portion. He had
            indulged in excesses whose very idea but four and twenty hours before He had
            recoiled at with horror. He shuddered at reflecting, that a trifling
            indiscretion on his part, or on Matilda's, would overturn that fabric of
            reputation which it had cost him thirty years to erect, and render him the
            abhorrence of that <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0200" n="187"/>People of whom He
            was then the Idol. Conscience painted to him in glaring colours his perjury
            and weakness; Apprehension magnified to him the horrors of punishment, and He
            already fancied himself in the prisons of the Inquisition. To these tormenting
            ideas, succeeded Matilda's beauty, and those delicious lessons, which once
            learnt can never be forgotten. A single glance thrown upon these reconciled
            him with himself. He considered the pleasures of the former night to have been
            purchased at an easy price by the sacrifice of innocence and honour. Their
            very remembrance filled his soul with ecstacy; He cursed his foolish vanity,
            which had induced him to waste in obscurity the bloom of life, ignorant of the
            blessings of Love and Woman. He determined at all events to continue his
            commerce with Matilda, and called every argument to his aid, which might
            confirm his resolution. He asked himself, provided his irregularity was
            unknown, in what would his fault consist, and what consequences He had to
            apprehend? <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0201" n="188"/>By adhering strictly to
            every rule of his order save Chastity, He doubted not to retain the esteem of
            Men, and even the protection of heaven. He trusted easily to be forgiven so
            slight and natural a deviation from his vows: But He forgot that having
            pronounced those vows, Incontinence, in Lay-men the most venial of errors,
            became in his person the most heinous of crimes. </p>
          <p>Once decided upon his future conduct, his mind became more easy. He threw
            himself upon his bed, and strove by sleeping to recruit his strength exhausted
            by his nocturnal excesses. He awoke refreshed, and eager for a repetition of
            his pleasures. Obedient to Matilda's order, He visited not her Cell during the
            day. Father Pablos mentioned in the Refectory, that Rosario had at length been
            prevailed upon to follow his prescription; But that the medicine had not
            produced the slightest effect, and that He believed no mortal skill could
            rescue him from the Grave. With this opinion the Abbot agreed, and affected to
            lament the untimely <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0202" n="189"/>fate of a Youth,
            whose talents had appeared so promising. </p>
          <p>The night arrived. Ambrosio had taken care to procure from the Porter the Key
            of the low door opening into the Cemetery. Furnished with this, when all was
            silent in the Monastery, He quitted his Cell, and hastened to Matilda's. She
            had left her bed, and was drest before his arrival. </p>
          <p>`I have been expecting you with impatience,' said She; `My life depends upon
            these moments. Have you the Key?' </p>
          <p>`I have.' </p>
          <p>`Away then to the garden. We have no time to lose. Follow me!' </p>
          <p>She took a small covered Basket from the Table. Bearing this in one hand, and
            the Lamp, which was flaming upon the Hearth, in the other, She hastened from
            the Cell. Ambrosio followed her. Both maintained a profound silence. She moved
            on with quick but cautious steps, passed through the Cloisters, and reached
            the Western side of the Garden. Her eyes flashed with a fire and <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0203" n="190"/>wildness, which impressed the Monk at
            once with awe and horror. A determined desperate courage reigned upon her
            brow. She gave the Lamp to Ambrosio; Then taking from him the Key, She
            unlocked the low Door, and entered the Cemetery. It was a vast and spacious
            Square planted with yew-trees: Half of it belonged to the Abbey; The other
            half was the property of the Sister-hood of St. Clare, and was protected by a
            roof of Stone. The Division was marked by an iron railing, the wicket of which
            was generally left unlocked. </p>
          <p>Thither Matilda bent her course. She opened the wicket, and sought for the
            door leading to the subterraneous Vaults, where reposed the mouldering Bodies
            of the Votaries of St. Clare. The night was perfectly dark; Neither Moon or
            Stars were visible. Luckily there was not a breath of Wind, and the Friar bore
            his Lamp in full security: By the assistance of its beams, the door of the
            Sepulchre was soon discovered. It was sunk within the hollow of a wall, and
            almost concealed by <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0204" n="191"/> thick festoons
            of ivy hanging over it. Three steps of rough-hewn Stone conducted to it, and
            Matilda was on the point of descending them, when She suddenly started back. </p>
          <p>`There are People in the Vaults!' She whispered to the Monk; `Conceal
            yourself till they are past. </p>
          <p>She took refuge behind a lofty and magnificent Tomb, erected in honour of the
            Convent's Foundress. Ambrosio followed her example, carefully hiding his Lamp,
            lest its beams should betray them. But a few moments had elapsed when the Door
            was pushed open leading to the subterraneous Caverns. Rays of light proceeded
            up the Stair-case: They enabled the concealed Spectators to observe two
            Females drest in religious habits, who seemed engaged in earnest conversation.
            The Abbot had no difficulty to recognize the Prioress of St. Clare in the
            first, and one of the elder Nuns in her Companion. </p>
          <p>`Every thing is prepared,' said the Prioress; `Her fate shall be decided
            to-morrow. All her tears and sighs will be unavailing. <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0205" n="192"/>No! In five and twenty years that I
            have been Superior of this Convent, never did I witness a transaction more
            infamous!' </p>
          <p>`You must expect much opposition to your will;' the Other replied in a milder
            voice; `Agnes has many Friends in the Convent, and in particular the Mother
            St. Ursula will espouse her cause most warmly. In truth, She merits to have
            Friends; and I wish, I could prevail upon you to consider her youth, and her
            peculiar situation. She seems sensible of her fault; The excess of her grief
            proves her penitence, and I am convinced that her tears flow more from
            contrition, than fear of punishment. Reverend Mother, would you be persuaded
            to mitigate the severity of your sentence, would you but deign to over-look
            this first transgression, I offer myself as the pledge of her future conduct.' </p>
          <p>`Over-look it, say you? Mother Camilla, you amaze me! What? After disgracing
            me in the presence of Madrid's Idol, of the very Man on whom I most wished to
              <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0206" n="193"/>impress an idea of the strictness
            of my discipline? How despicable must I have appeared to the reverend Abbot!
            No, Mother, No! I never can forgive the insult. I cannot better convince
            Ambrosio that I abhor such crimes, than by punishing that of Agnes with all
            the rigour of which our severe laws admit. Cease then your supplications; They
            will all be unavailing. My resolution is taken: To-morrow Agnes shall be made
            a terrible example of my justice and resentment.' </p>
          <p>The Mother Camilla seemed not to give up the point, but by this time the Nuns
            were out of hearing. The Prioress unlocked the door which communicated with
            St. Clare's Chapel, and having entered with her Companion closed it again
            after them. </p>
          <p>Matilda now asked, who was this Agnes with whom the Prioress was thus
            incensed, and what connexion She could have with Ambrosio. He related her
            adventure; and He added, that since that time his ideas having undergone a
            thorough revolution, <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0207" n="194"/>He now felt
            much compassion for the unfortunate Nun. </p>
          <p>`I design,' said He, `to request an audience of the Domina to-morrow, and use
            every means of obtaining a mitigation of her sentence.' </p>
          <p>`Beware of what you do!' interrupted Matilda; `Your sudden change of
            sentiment may naturally create surprize, and may give birth to suspicions
            which it is most our interest to avoid. Rather redouble your outward
            austerity, and thunder out menaces against the errors of others, the better to
            conceal your own. Abandon the Nun to her fate. Your interfering might be
            dangerous, and her imprudence merits to be punished: She is unworthy to enjoy
            Love's pleasures, who has not wit enough to conceal them. But in discussing
            this trifling subject I waste moments which are precious. The night flies
            apace, and much must be done before morning. The Nuns are retired; All is
            safe. Give me the Lamp, Ambrosio. I must descend alone into these <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0208" n="195"/>Caverns: Wait here, and if any one
            approaches, warn me by your voice; But as you value your existence, presume
            not to follow me. Your life would fall a victim to your imprudent curiosity.' </p>
          <p>Thus saying She advanced towards the Sepulchre, still holding her Lamp in one
            hand, and her little Basket in the other. She touched the door: It turned
            slowly upon its grating hinges, and a narrow winding stair-case of black
            marble presented itself to her eyes. She descended it. Ambrosio remained
            above, watching the faint beams of the Lamp, as they still proceeded up the
            stairs. They disappeared, and He found himself in total darkness. </p>
          <p>Left to himself He could not reflect without surprize on the sudden change in
            Matilda's character and sentiments. But a few days had past, since She
            appeared the mildest and softest of her sex, devoted to his will, and looking
            up to him as to a superior Being. Now She assumed a sort of courage and
            manliness in her manners and <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0209" n="196"
            />discourse but ill calculated to please him. She spoke no longer to
            insinuate, but command: He found himself unable to cope with her in argument,
            and was unwillingly obliged to confess the superiority of her judgment. Every
            moment convinced him of the astonishing powers of her mind: But what She
            gained in the opinion of the Man, She lost with interest in the affection of
            the Lover. He regretted Rosario, the fond, the gentle, and submissive: He
            grieved, that Matilda preferred the virtues of his sex to those of her own;
            and when He thought of her expressions respecting the devoted Nun, He could
            not help blaming them as cruel and unfeminine. Pity is a sentiment so natural,
            so appropriate to the female character, that it is scarcely a merit for a
            Woman to possess it, but to be without it is a grievous crime. Ambrosio could
            not easily forgive his Mistress for being deficient in this amiable quality.
            However, though he blamed her insensibility, He felt the truth of her
            observations; and though He pitied <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0210" n="197"
            />sincerely the unfortunate Agnes, He resolved to drop the idea of interposing
            in her behalf. </p>
          <p>Near an hour had elapsed, since Matilda descended into the Caverns; Still She
            returned not. Ambrosio's curiosity was excited. He drew near the Stair-case.
            He listened. All was silent, except that at intervals He caught the sound of
            Matilda's voice, as it wound along the subteraneous passages, and was
            re-echoed by the Sepulchre's vaulted roofs. She was at too great a distance
            for him to distinguish her words, and ere they reached him they were deadened
            into a low murmur. He longed to penetrate into this mystery. He resolved to
            disobey her injunctions, and follow her into the Cavern. He advanced to the
            Stair-case; He had already descended some steps, when his courage failed him.
            He remembered Matilda's menaces if He infringed her orders, and his bosom was
            filled with a secret unaccountable awe. He returned up the stairs, resumed <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0211" n="198"/>his former station, and waited
            impatiently for the conclusion of this adventure. </p>
          <p>Suddenly He was sensible of a violent shock: An earth-quake rocked the
            ground. The Columns, which supported the roof under which He stood, were so
            strongly shaken, that every moment menaced him with its fall, and at the same
            moment He heard a loud and tremendous burst of thunder. It ceased, and his
            eyes being fixed upon the Stair-case, He saw a bright column of light flash
            along the Caverns beneath. It was seen but for an instant. No sooner did it
            disappear, than all was once more quiet and obscure. Profound Darkness again
            surrounded him, and the silence of night was only broken by the whirring Bat,
            as She flitted slowly by him. </p>
          <p>With every instant Ambrosio's amazement increased. Another hour elapsed,
            after which the same light again appeared and was lost again as suddenly. It
            was accompanied by a strain of sweet but solemn <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0212" n="199"/>Music, which as it stole through the
            Vaults below, inspired the Monk with mingled delight and terror. It had not
            long been hushed, when He heard Matilda's steps upon the Staircase. She
            ascended from the Cavern; The most lively joy animated her beautiful features. </p>
          <p>`Did you see any thing?' She asked. </p>
          <p>`Twice I saw a column of light flash up the Staircase.' </p>
          <p>`Nothing else?' </p>
          <p>`Nothing.' </p>
          <p>`The Morning is on the point of breaking. Let us retire to the Abbey, lest
            day-light should betray us.' </p>
          <p>With a light step She hastened from the burying- ground. She regained her
            Cell, and the curious Abbot still accompanied her. She closed the door, and
            disembarrassed herself of her Lamp and Basket. </p>
          <p>`I have succeeded!' She cried, throwing herself upon his bosom: `Succeeded
            beyond my fondest hopes! I shall live, Ambrosio, shall live for you! The step,
            which <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0213" n="200"/>I shuddered at taking, proves
            to me a source of joys inexpressible! Oh! that I dared communicate those joys
            to you! Oh! that I were permitted to share with you my power, and raise you as
            high above the level of your sex, as one bold deed has exalted me above mine!' </p>
          <p>`And what prevents you, Matilda?' interrupted the Friar; `Why is your
            business in the Cavern made a secret? Do you think me undeserving of your
            confidence? Matilda, I must doubt the truth of your affection, while you have
            joys in which I am forbidden to share.' </p>
          <p>`You reproach me with injustice. I grieve sincerely, that I am obliged to
            conceal from you my happiness. But I am not to blame: The fault lies not in
            me, but in yourself, my Ambrosio! You are still too much the Monk. Your mind
            is enslaved by the prejudices of Education; And Superstition might make you
            shudder at the idea of that, which experience has taught me to prize and
            value. At present you are unfit <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0214" n="201"/>to
            be trusted with a secret of such importance: But the strength of your
            judgment; and the curiosity which I rejoice to see sparkling in your eyes,
            makes me hope, that you will one day deserve my confidence. Till that period
            arrives, restrain your impatience. Remember that you have given me your solemn
            oath, never to enquire into this night's adventures. I insist upon your
            keeping this oath: For though' She added smiling, while She sealed his lips
            with a wanton kiss; `Though I forgive your breaking your vows to heaven, I
            expect you to keep your vows to me.' </p>
          <p>The Friar returned the embrace, which had set his blood on fire. The
            luxurious and unbounded excesses of the former night were renewed, and they
            separated not till the Bell rang for Matins. </p>
          <p>The same pleasures were frequently repeated. The Monks rejoiced in the
            feigned Rosario's unexpected recovery, and none of them suspected his real
            sex. The <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0215" n="202"/> Abbot possessed his
            Mistress in tranquillity, and perceiving his frailty unsuspected, abandoned
            himself to his passions in full security. Shame and remorse no longer
            tormented him. Frequent repetitions made him familiar with sin, and his bosom
            became proof against the stings of Conscience. In these sentiments He was
            encouraged by Matilda; But She soon was aware that She had satiated her Lover
            by the unbounded freedom of her caresses. Her charms becoming accustomed to
            him, they ceased to excite the same desires, which at first they had inspired.
            The delirium of passion being past, He had leisure to observe every trifling
            defect: Where none were to be found, Satiety made him fancy them. The Monk was
            glutted with the fullness of pleasure: A Week had scarcely elapsed, before He
            was wearied of his Paramour: His warm constitution still made him seek in her
            arms the gratification of his lust: But when the moment of passion was over,
            He quitted her <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0216" n="202"/>with disgust, and his
            humour, naturally inconstant, made him sigh impatiently for variety. </p>
          <p>Possession, which cloys Man, only increases the affection of Woman. Matilda
            with every succeeding day grew more attached to the Friar. Since He had
            obtained her favours, He was become dearer to her than ever, and She felt
            grateful to him for the pleasures, in which they had equally been Sharers.
            Unfortunately as her passion grew ardent, Ambrosio's grew cold; The very marks
            of her fondness excited his disgust, and its excess served to extinguish the
            flame, which already burned but feebly in his bosom. Matilda could not but
            remark that her society seemed to him daily less agreeable: He was inattentive
            while She spoke: her musical talents, which She possessed in perfection, had
            lost the power of amusing him; Or if He deigned to praise them, his
            compliments were evidently forced and cold. He no longer gazed upon her with
            affection, or applauded her <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0217" n="204"
            />sentiments with a Lover's partiality. This Matilda well perceived, and
            redoubled her efforts to revive those sentiments, which He once had felt. She
            could not but fail, since He considered as importunities, the pains which She
            took to please him, and was disgusted by the very means which She used to
            recall the Wanderer. Still, however, their illicit Commerce continued: But it
            was clear, that He was led to her arms, not by love, but the cravings of
            brutal appetite. His constitution made a Woman necessary to him, and Matilda
            was the only one with whom He could indulge his passions safely: In spite of
            her beauty, He gazed upon every other Female with more desire; But fearing
            that his Hypocrisy should be made public, He confined his inclinations to his
            own breast. </p>
          <p>It was by no means his nature to be timid: But his education had impressed
            his mind with fear so strongly, that apprehension was now become part of his
            character. Had his Youth been passed in the world, He would have shown himself
            possessed of <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0218" n="205"/>many brilliant and
            manly qualities. He was naturally enterprizing, firm, and fearless: He had a
            Warrior's heart, and He might have shone with splendour at the head of an
            Army. There was no want of generosity in his nature: The Wretched never failed
            to find in him a compassionate Auditor: His abilities were quick and shining,
            and his judgment. vast, solid, and decisive. With such qualifications He would
            have been an ornament to his Country: That He possessed them, He had given
            proofs in his earliest infancy, and his Parents had beheld his dawning virtues
            with the fondest delight and admiration. Unfortunately, while yet a Child He
            was deprived of those Parents. He fell into the power of a Relation, whose
            only wish about him was never to hear of him more; For that purpose He gave
            him in charge to his Friend, the former Superior of the Capuchins. The Abbot,
            a very Monk, used all his endeavours to persuade the Boy, that happiness
            existed not without the walls of a Convent. He succeeded fully. To <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0219" n="206"/>deserve admittance into the order of
            St. Francis was Ambrosio's highest ambition. His Instructors carefully
            repressed those virtues, whose grandeur and disinterestedness were ill-suited
            to the Cloister. Instead of universal benevolence He adopted a selfish
            partiality for his own particular establishment: He was taught to consider
            compassion for the errors of Others as a crime of the blackest dye: The noble
            frankness of his temper was exchanged for servile humility; and in order to
            break his natural spirit, the Monks terrified his young mind, by placing
            before him all the horrors with which Superstition could furnish them: They
            painted to him the torments of the Damned in colours the most dark, terrible,
            and fantastic, and threatened him at the slightest fault with eternal
            perdition. No wonder, that his imagination constantly dwelling upon these
            fearful objects should have rendered his character timid and apprehensive. Add
            to this, that his long absence from the great world, and total unacquaintance
            with the common <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0220" n="207"/> dangers of life
            made him form of them an idea far more dismal than the reality. While the
            Monks were busied in rooting out his virtues, and narrowing his sentiments,
            they allowed every vice which had fallen to his share, to arrive at full
            perfection. He was suffered to be proud, vain, ambitious, and disdainful: He
            was jealous of his Equals, and despised all merit but his own: He was
            implacable when offended, and cruel in his revenge. Still in spite of the
            pains taken to pervert them, his natural good qualities would occasionally
            break through the gloom cast over them so carefully: At such times the contest
            for superiority between his real and acquired character was striking and
            unaccountable to those unacquainted with his original disposition. He
            pronounced the most severe sentences upon Offenders, which the moment alter
            Compassion induced him to mitigate: He undertook the most daring enterprizes,
            which the fear of their consequences soon obliged him to abandon: His in-born
            genius darted a brilliant light upon <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0221" n="208"
            />subjects the most obscure; and almost instantaneously his Superstition
            replunged them in darkness more profound than that from which they had just
            been rescued. His Brother Monks, regarding him as a Superior Being, remarked
            not this contradiction in their Idol's conduct. They were persuaded, that what
            He did must be right, and supposed him to have good reasons for changing his
            resolutions. The fact was, that the different sentiments, with which Education
            and Nature had inspired him, were combating in his bosom: It remained for his
            passions which as yet no opportunity had called into play, to decide the
            victory. Unfortunately his passions were the very worst Judges, to whom He
            could possibly have applied. His monastic seclusion had till now been in his
            favour, since it gave him no room for discovering his bad qualities. The
            superiority of his talents raised him too far above his Companions to permit
            his being jealous of them: His exemplary piety, persuasive eloquence, and <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0222" n="209"/>pleasing manners had secured him
            universal Esteem, and consequently He had no injuries to revenge: His Ambition
            was justified by his acknowledged merit, and his pride considered as no more
            than proper confidence. He never saw, much less conversed with, the other sex:
            He was ignorant of the pleasures in Woman's power to bestow, and if He read in
            the course of his studies</p>

          <q>`That Men were fond, He smiled, and wondered how!'</q>

          <p>For a time spare diet, frequent watching, and severe penance cooled and
            represt the natural warmth of his constitution: But no sooner did opportunity
            present itself, no sooner did He catch a glimpse of joys to which He was still
            a Stranger, than Religion's barriers were too feeble to resist the
            over-whelming torrent of his desires. All impediments yielded before the force
            of his temperament, warm, sanguine, and voluptuous in the excess. As yet his
            other passions lay dormant; But they only needed to <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0223" n="210"/>be once awakened, to display
            themselves with violence as great and irresistible. </p>
          <p>He continued to be the admiration of Madrid. The Enthusiasm created by his
            eloquence seemed rather to increase than diminish. Every Thursday, which was
            the only day when He appeared in public, the Capuchin- Cathedral was crowded
            with Auditors, and his discourse was always received with the same
            approbation. He was named Confessor to all the chief families in Madrid; and
            no one was counted fashionable, who was injoined penance by any other than
            Ambrosio. In his resolution of never stirring out of his Convent He still
            persisted. This circumstance created a still greater opinion of his sanctity
            and self-denial. Above all the Women sang forth his praises loudly, less
            influenced by devotion than by his noble countenance, majestic air, and
            well-turned graceful figure. The Abbey-door was thronged with Carriages from
            morning to night; and the noblest and <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0224" n="211"
            /> fairest Dames of Madrid confessed to the Abbot their secret peccadilloes.
            The eyes of the luxurious Friar devoured their charms: Had his Penitents
            consulted those Interpreters, He would have needed no other means of
            expressing his desires. For his misfortune, they were so strongly persuaded of
            his continence, that the possibility of his harbouring indecent thoughts never
            once entered their imaginations. The climate's heat, 'tis well known, operates
            with no small influence upon the constitutions of the Spanish Ladies: But the
            most abandoned would have thought it an easier task to inspire with passion
            the marble Statue of St. Francis, than the cold and rigid heart of the
            immaculate Ambrosio. </p>
          <p>On his part, the Friar was little acquainted with the depravity of the world;
            He suspected not, that but few of his Penitents would have rejected his
            addresses. Yet had He been better instructed on this head, the danger
            attending such an attempt would have sealed up his lips in silence. He knew
            that it <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0225" n="212"/>would be difficult for a
            Woman to keep a secret so strange and so important as his frailty; and He even
            trembled, lest Matilda should betray him. Anxious to preserve a reputation
            which was infinitely dear to him, He saw all the risque of committing it to
            the power of some vain giddy Female; and as the Beauties of Madrid affected
            only his senses without touching his heart, He forgot them as soon as they
            were out of his sight. The danger of discovery, the fear of being repulsed,
            the loss of reputation, all these considerations counselled him to stifle his
            desires: And though He now felt for it the most perfect indifference, He was
            necessitated to confine himself to Matilda's person. </p>
          <p>One morning, the confluence of Penitents was greater than usual. He was
            detained in the Confessional Chair till a late hour. At length the crowd was
            dispatched, and He prepared to quit the Chapel, when two Females entered, and
            drew near him with humility. They threw up their veils, <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0226" n="213"/>and the youngest entreated him to
            listen to her for a few moments. The melody of her voice, of that voice to
            which no Man ever listened without interest, immediately caught Ambrosio's
            attention. He stopped. The Petitioner seemed bowed down with affliction: Her
            cheeks were pale, her eyes dimmed with tears, and her hair fell in disorder
            over her face and bosom. Still her countenance was so sweet, so innocent, so
            heavenly, as might have charmed an heart less susceptible, than that which
            panted in the Abbot's breast. With more than usual softness of manner He
            desired her to proceed, and heard her speak as follows with an emotion, which
            increased every moment. </p>
          <p>`Reverend Father, you see an Unfortunate, threatened with the loss of her
            dearest, of almost her only Friend! My Mother, my excellent Mother lies upon
            the bed of sickness. A sudden and dreadful malady seized her last night; and
            so rapid has been its progress, that the Physicians despair of her life. Human
            aid fails me; Nothing <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0227" n="214"/>remains for me
            but to implore the mercy of Heaven. Father, all Madrid rings with the report
            of your piety and virtue. Deign to remember my Mother in your prayers: Perhaps
            they may prevail on the Almighty to spare her; and should that be the case, I
            engage myself every Thursday in the next three Months to illuminate the Shrine
            of St. Francis in his honour.' </p>
          <p>`So!' thought the Monk; `Here we have a second Vincentio della Ronda.
            Rosario's adventure began thus,' and He wished secretly, that this might have
            the same conclusion. </p>
          <p>He acceded to the request. The Petitioner returned him thanks with every mark
            of gratitude, and then continued. </p>
          <p>`I have yet another favour to ask. We are Strangers in Madrid; My Mother
            needs a Confessor, and knows not to whom She should apply. We understand that
            you never quit the Abbey, and Alas! my poor Mother is unable to come hither!
            If you would have the goodness, reverend Father, <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0228" n="215"/>to name a proper person, whose wise
            and pious consolations may soften the agonies of my Parent's death-bed, you
            will confer an everlasting favour upon hearts not ungrateful.' </p>
          <p>With this petition also the Monk complied. Indeed, what petition would He
            have refused, if urged in such enchanting accents? The suppliant was so
            interesting! Her voice was so sweet, so harmonious! Her very tears became her,
            and her affliction seemed to add new lustre to her charms. He promised to send
            to her a Confessor that same Evening, and begged her to leave her address. The
            Companion presented him with a Card on which it was written, and then
            with-drew with the fair Petitioner, who pronounced before her departure a
            thousand benedictions on the Abbot's goodness. His eyes followed her out of
            the Chapel. It was not till She was out of sight that He examined the Card, on
            which He read the following words. </p>
          <p>`Donna Elvira Dalfa, Strada di San <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0229" n="216"
            />Iago, four doors from the Palace d'Albornos.' </p>
          <p>The Suppliant was no other than Antonia, and Leonella was her Companion. The
            Latter had not consented without difficulty to accompany her Niece to the
            Abbey: Ambrosio had inspired her with such awe, that She trembled at the very
            sight of him. Her fears had conquered even her natural loquacity, and while in
            his presence She uttered not a single syllable. </p>
          <p>The Monk retired to his Cell, whither He was pursued by Antonia's image. He
            felt a thousand new emotions springing in his bosom, and He trembled to
            examine into the cause which gave them birth. They were totally different from
            those inspired by Matilda, when She first declared her sex and her affection.
            He felt not the provocation of lust; No voluptuous desires rioted in his
            bosom; Nor did a burning imagination picture to him the charms, which Modesty
            had veiled from his eyes. On the contrary, what He now felt was a mingled
            sentiment <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0230" n="217"/>of tenderness, admiration,
            and respect. A soft and delicious melancholy infused itself into his soul, and
            He would not have exchanged it for the most lively transports of joy. Society
            now disgusted him: He delighted in solitude, which permitted his indulging the
            visions of Fancy: His thoughts were all gentle, sad, and soothing, and the
            whole wide world presented him with no other object than Antonia. </p>
          <p>`Happy Man!' He exclaimed in his romantic enthusiasm; `Happy Man, who is
            destined to possess the heart of that lovely Girl! What delicacy in her
            features! What elegance in her form! How enchanting was the timid innocence of
            her eyes, and how different from the wanton expression, the wild luxurious
            fire, which sparkles in Matilda's! Oh! sweeter must one kiss be snatched from
            the rosy lips of the First, than all the full and lustful favours bestowed so
            freely by the Second. Matilda gluts me with enjoyment even to loathing, forces
            me to her arms, apes the Harlot, and glories <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0231"
              n="218"/>in her prostitution. Disgusting! Did She know the inexpressible
            charm of Modesty, how irresistibly it enthralls the heart of Man, how firmly
            it chains him to the Throne of Beauty, She never would have thrown it off.
            What would be too dear a price for this lovely Girl's affections? What would I
            refuse to sacrifice, could I be released from my vows, and permitted to
            declare my love in the sight of earth and heaven? While I strove to inspire
            her with tenderness, with friendship and esteem, how tranquil and undisturbed
            would the hours roll away! Gracious God! To see her blue down-cast eyes beam
            upon mine with timid fondness! To sit for days, for years listening to that
            gentle voice! To acquire the right of obliging her, and hear the artless
            expressions of her gratitude! To watch the emotions of her spotless heart! To
            encourage each dawning virtue! To share in her joy when happy, to kiss away
            her tears when distrest, and to see her fly to my arms for comfort and
            support! Yes; If there is <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0232" n="219"/>perfect
            bliss on earth, 'tis his lot alone, who becomes that Angel's Husband.' </p>
          <p>While his fancy coined these ideas, He paced his Cell with a disordered air.
            His eyes were fixed upon vacancy: His head reclined upon his shoulder; A tear
            rolled down his cheek, while He reflected that the vision of happiness for him
            could never be realized. </p>
          <p>`She is lost to me!' He continued; `By marriage She cannot be mine: And to
            seduce such innocence, to use the confidence reposed in me to work her ruin. .
            . . Oh! it would be a crime, blacker than yet the world ever witnessed! Fear
            not, lovely Girl! Your virtue runs no risque from me. Not for Indies would I
            make that gentle bosom know the tortures of remorse.' </p>
          <p>Again He paced his chamber hastily. Then stopping, his eye fell upon the
            picture of his once-admired Madona. He tore it with indignation from the wall:
            He threw it on the ground, and spurned it from him with his foot. </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0233" n="220"/>`The Prostitute!' </p>
          <p>Unfortunate Matilda! Her Paramour forgot, that for his sake alone She had
            forfeited her claim to virtue; and his only reason for despising her was, that
            She had loved him much too well. </p>
          <p>He threw himself into a Chair, which stood near the Table. He saw the card
            with Elvira's address. He took it up, and it brought to his recollection his
            promise respecting a Confessor. He passed a few minutes in doubt: But
            Antonia's Empire over him was already too much decided to permit his making a
            long resistance to the idea which struck him. He resolved to be the Confessor
            himself. He could leave the Abbey unobserved without difficulty: By wrapping
            up his head in his Cowl He hoped to pass through the Streets without being
            recognised: By taking these precautions, and by recommending secrecy to
            Elvira's family, He doubted not to keep Madrid in ignorance that He had broken
            his vow never to see the outside of the Abbey-walls. <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0234" n="221"/>Matilda was the only person whose
            vigilance He dreaded: But by informing her at the Refectory, that during the
            whole of that day Business would confine him to his Cell, He thought himself
            secure from her wakeful jealousy. Accordingly at the hours when the Spaniards
            are generally taking their Siesta, He ventured to quit the Abbey by a private
            door, the Key of which was in his possession. The Cowl of his habit was thrown
            over his face: From the heat of the weather the Streets were almost totally
            deserted: The Monk met with few people, found the Strada di San Iago, and
            arrived without accident at Donna Elvira's door. He rang, was admitted, and
            immediately ushered into an upper apartment. </p>
          <p>It was here, that He ran the greatest risque of a discovery. Had Leonella
            been at home, She would have recognized him directly: Her communicative
            disposition would never have permitted her to rest, till all Madrid was
            informed that Ambrosio had ventured out of the Abbey, and visited <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0235" n="222"/>her Sister. Fortune here stood the
            Monk's Friend. On Leonella's return home, She found a letter instructing her,
            that a Cousin was just dead, who had left what little He possessed between
            Herself and Elvira. To secure this bequest She was obliged to set out for
            Cordova without losing a moment. Amidst all her foibles her heart was truly
            warm and affectionate, and She was unwilling to quit her Sister in so
            dangerous a state. But Elvira insisted upon her taking the journey, conscious
            that in her Daughter's forlorn situation no increase of fortune, however
            trifling, ought to be neglected. Accordingly Leonella left Madrid, sincerely
            grieved at her Sister's illness, and giving some few sighs to the memory of
            the amiable but inconstant Don Christoval. She was fully persuaded, that at
            first She had made a terrible breach in his heart: But hearing nothing more of
            him, She supposed that He had quitted the pursuit, disgusted by the lowness of
            her origin, and knowing upon other terms than marriage He had <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0236" n="223"/>nothing to hope from such a Dragon of
            Virtue as She professed herself; Or else, that being naturally capricious and
            changeable, the remembrance of her charms had been effaced from the
            Cond&eacute;'s heart by those of some newer Beauty. Whatever was the cause
            of her losing him, She lamented it sorely. She strove in vain, as She assured
            every body who was kind enough to listen to her, to tear his image from her
            too susceptible heart. She affected the airs of a love-sick Virgin, and
            carried them all to the most ridiculous excess. She heaved lamentable sighs,
            walked with her arms folded, uttered long soliloquies, and her discourse
            generally turned upon some forsaken Maid, who expired of a broken heart! Her
            fiery locks were always ornamented with a garland of willow; Every evening She
            was seen straying upon the Banks of a rivulet by Moon-light; and She declared
            herself a violent Admirer of murmuring Streams and Nightingales;</p>

          <q><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0237" n="224"/>`Of lonely haunts, and twilight
            Groves, `Places which pale Passion loves!'</q>

          <p>Such was the state of Leonella's mind, when obliged to quit Madrid. Elvira
            was out of patience at all these follies, and endeavoured at persuading her to
            act like a reasonable Woman. Her advice was thrown away: Leonella assured her
            at parting, that nothing could make her forget the perfidious Don Christoval.
            In this point She was fortunately mistaken. An honest Youth of Cordova,
            Journeyman to an Apothecary, found that her fortune would be sufficient to set
            him up in a genteel Shop of his own: In consequence of this reflection He
            avowed himself her Admirer. Leonella was not inflexible. The ardour of his
            sighs melted her heart, and She soon consented to make him the happiest of
            Mankind. She wrote to inform her Sister of her marriage; But, for reasons
            which will be explained here-after, Elvira never answered her letter. </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0238" n="225"/>Ambrosio was conducted into the
            Anti-chamber to that, where Elvira was reposing. The Female Domestic who had
            admitted him, left him alone, while She announced his arrival to her Mistress.
            Antonia who had been by her Mother's Bed-side, immediately came to him. </p>
          <p>`Pardon me, Father,' said She advancing towards him; when recognizing his
            features She stopped suddenly, and uttered a cry of joy. `Is it possible!' She
            continued; </p>
          <p>`Do not my eyes deceive me? Has the worthy Ambrosio broken through his
            resolution, that He may soften the agonies of the best of Women? What pleasure
            will this visit give my Mother! Let me not delay for a moment the comfort,
            which your piety and wisdom will afford her.' </p>
          <p>Thus saying, She opened the chamber-door, presented to her Mother her
            distinguished Visitor, and having placed an armed-chair by the side of the
            Bed, withdrew into another department. </p>
          <p>Elvira was highly gratified by this visit: <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0239"
              n="226"/>Her expectations had been raised high by general report, but She
            found them far exceeded. Ambrosio, endowed by nature with powers of pleasing,
            exerted them to the utmost while conversing with Antonia's Mother. With
            persuasive eloquence He calmed every fear, and dissipated every scruple: He
            bad her reflect on the infinite mercy of her Judge, despoiled Death of his
            darts and terrors, and taught her to view without shrinking the abyss of
            eternity, on whose brink She then stood. Elvira was absorbed in attention and
            delight: While She listened to his exhortations, confidence and comfort stole
            insensibly into her mind. She unbosomed to him without hesitation her cares
            and apprehensions. The latter respecting a future life He had already quieted:
            And He now removed the former, which She felt for the concerns of this. She
            trembled for Antonia. She had none to whose care She could recommend her, save
            to the Marquis de las Cisternas, and her Sister Leonella. The protection of
            the One was very <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0240" n="227"/>uncertain; and as
            to the Other, though fond of her Niece Leonella was so thoughtless and vain,
            as to make her an improper person to have the sole direction of a Girl so
            young and ignorant of the World. The Friar no sooner learnt the cause of her
            alarms, than He begged her to make herself easy upon that head. He doubted not
            being able to secure for Antonia a safe refuge in the House of one of his
            Penitents, the Marchioness of Villa-Franca: This was a Lady of acknowledged
            virtue, remarkable for strict principles and extensive charity. Should
            accident deprive her of this resource, He engaged to procure Antonia a
            reception in some respectable Convent: That is to say, in quality of boarder;
            for Elvira had declared herself no Friend to a monastic life, and the Monk was
            either candid or complaisant enough to allow, that her disapprobation was not
            unfounded. </p>
          <p>These proofs of the interest which He felt for her, completely won Elvira's
            heart. In <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0241" n="228"/>thanking him She exhausted
            every expression which Gratitude could furnish, and protested, that now She
            should resign herself with tranquillity to the Grave. Ambrosio rose to take
            leave: He promised to return the next day at the same hour, but requested that
            his visits might be kept secret. </p>
          <p>`I am unwilling' said He, `that my breaking through a rule imposed by
            necessity, should be generally known. Had I not resolved never to quit my
            Convent, except upon circumstances as urgent as that which has conducted me to
            your door, I should be frequently summoned upon insignificant occasions: That
            time would be engrossed by the Curious, the Unoccupied, and the fanciful,
            which I now pass at the Bed-side of the Sick, in comforting the expiring
            Penitent, and clearing the passage to Eternity from Thorns.' </p>
          <p>Elvira commended equally his prudence and compassion, promising to conceal
              <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0242" n="229"/>carefully the honour of his
            visits. The Monk then gave her his benediction, and retired from the chamber. </p>
          <p>In the Anti-room He found Antonia: He could not refuse himself the pleasure
            of passing a few moments in her society. He bad her take comfort, for that her
            Mother seemed composed and tranquil, and He hoped that She might yet do well.
            He enquired who attended her, and engaged to send the Physician of his Convent
            to see her, one of the most skilful in Madrid. He then launched out in
            Elvira's commendation, praised her purity and fortitude of mind, and declared,
            that She had inspired him with the highest esteem and reverence. Antonia's
            innocent heart swelled with gratitude: Joy danced in her eyes, where a tear
            still sparkled. The hopes which He gave her of her Mother's recovery, the
            lively interest which He seemed to feel for her, and the flattering way in
            which She was mentioned by him, added to the report of his <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0243" n="230"/>judgment and virtue, and to the
            impression made upon her by his eloquence, confirmed the favourable opinion
            with which his first, appearance had inspired Antonia. She replied with
            diffidence, but without restraint: She feared not to relate to him all her
            little sorrows, all her little fears and anxieties; and She thanked him for
            his goodness with all the genuine warmth, which favours kindle in a young and
            innocent heart. Such alone know how to estimate benefits at their full value.
            They who are conscious of Mankind's perfidy and selfishness, ever receive an
            obligation with apprehension and distrust: They suspect, that some secret
            motive must lurk behind it: They express their thanks with restraint and
            caution, and fear to praise a kind action to its full extent, aware that some
            future day a return may be required. Not so Antonia; She thought, the world
            was composed only of those who resembled her, and that vice existed was to her
            still a secret. The Monk had been of service to her; He <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0244" n="231"/>said, that He wished her well; She was
            grateful for his kindness, and thought that no terms were strong enough to be
            the vehicle of her thanks. With what delight did Ambrosio listen to the
            declaration of her artless gratitude! The natural grace of her manners, the
            unequalled sweetness of her voice, her modest vivacity, her unstudied
            elegance, her expressive countenance, and intelligent eyes united to inspire
            him with pleasure and admiration: While the solidity and correctness of her
            remarks received additional beauty from the unaffected simplicity of the
            language, in which they were conveyed. </p>
          <p>Ambrosio was at length obliged to tear himself from this conversation, which
            possessed for him but too many charms. He repeated to Antonia his wishes, that
            his visits should not be made known, which desire She promised to observe. He
            then quitted the House, while his Enchantress hastened to her Mother, ignorant
            of the mischief which her Beauty had caused. She was eager to <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0245" n="232"/> know Elvira's opinion of the Man whom
            She had praised in such enthusiastic terms, and was delighted to find it
            equally favourable, if not even more so, than her own. </p>
          <p>`Even before He spoke,' said Elvira, `I was prejudiced in his favour: The
            fervour of his exhortations, dignity of his manner, and closeness of his
            reasoning, were very far from inducing me to alter my opinion. His fine and
            full- toned voice struck me particularly; But surely, Antonia, I have heard it
            before. It seemed perfectly familiar to my ear. Either I must have known the
            Abbot in former times, or his voice bears a wonderful resemblance to that of
            some other, to whom I have often listened. There were certain tones which
            touched my very heart, and made me feel sensations so singular, that I strive
            in vain to account for them.' </p>
          <p>`My dearest Mother, it produced the same effect upon me: Yet certainly
            neither of us ever heard his voice till we came to Madrid. I suspect, that
            what we attribute <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0246" n="233"/>to his voice,
            really proceeds from his pleasant manners, which forbid our considering him as
            a Stranger. I know not why, but I feel more at my ease while conversing with
            him, than I usually do with people who are unknown to me. I feared not to
            repeat to him all my childish thoughts; and some-how I felt confident that He
            would hear my folly with indulgence. Oh! I was not deceived in him! He
            listened to me with such an air of kindness and attention! He answered me with
            such gentleness, such condescension! He did not call me an Infant, and treat
            me with contempt, as our cross old Confessor at the Castle used to do. I
            verily believe, that if I had lived in Murcia a thousand years, I never should
            have liked that fat old Father Dominic!' </p>
          <p>`I confess, that Father Dominic had not the most pleasing manners in the
            world; But He was honest, friendly, and well-meaning.' </p>
          <p>`Ah! my dear Mother, those qualities are so common!' </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0247" n="234"/>`God grant, my Child, that
            Experience may not teach you to think them rare and precious: I have found
            them but too much so! But tell me, Antonia; Why is it impossible for me to
            have seen the Abbot before?' </p>
          <p>`Because since the moment when He entered the Abbey, He has never been on the
            outside of its walls. He told me just now, that from his ignorance of the
            Streets, He had some difficulty to find the Strada di San Iago, though so near
            the Abbey.' </p>
          <p>`All this is possible, and still I may have seen him <hi rend="italic"
              >before</hi> He entered the Abbey: In order to come out, it was rather
            necessary that He should first go in.' </p>
          <p>`Holy Virgin! As you say, that is very true.--Oh! But might He not have been
            born in the Abbey?' </p>
          <p>Elvira smiled. </p>
          <p>`Why not very easily.' </p>
          <p>`Stay, Stay! Now I recollect how it was. He was put into the Abbey quite a
            Child; The common People say, that He fell from <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0248" n="235"/>heaven, and was sent as a present to
            the Capuchins by the Virgin.' </p>
          <p>`That was very kind of her. And so He fell from heaven, Antonia? He must have
            had a terrible tumble.' </p>
          <p>`Many do not credit this, and I fancy, my dear Mother, that I must number you
            among the Unbelievers. Indeed, as our Land-lady told my Aunt, the general idea
            is, that his Parents, being poor and unable to maintain him, left him just
            born at the Abbey-door. The late Superior from pure charity had him educated
            in the Convent, and He proved to be a model of virtue, and piety, and
            learning, and I know not what else besides: In consequence, He was first
            received as a Brother of the order, and not long ago was chosen Abbot.
            However, whether this account or the other is the true one, at least all agree
            that when the Monks took him under their care, He could not speak: Therefore,
            you could not have heard his voice before He entered the <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0249" n="236"/> Monastery, because at that time He
            had no voice at all.' </p>
          <p>`Upon my word, Antonia, you argue very closely! Your conclusions are
            infallible! I did not suspect you of being so able a Logician.' </p>
          <p>`Ah! You are mocking me! But so much the better. It delights me to see you in
            spirits: Besides you seem tranquil and easy, and I hope, that you will have no
            more convulsions. Oh! I was sure the Abbot's visit would do you good!' </p>
          <p>`It has indeed done me good, my Child. He has quieted my mind upon some
            points which agitated me, and I already feel the effects of his attention. My
            eyes grow heavy, and I think I can sleep a little. Draw the curtains, my
            Antonia: But if I should not wake before midnight, do not sit up with me, I
            charge you.' </p>
          <p>Antonia promised to obey her, and having received her blessing drew the
            curtains of the Bed. She then seated herself in <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0250" n="237"/>silence at her embroidery frame, and
            beguiled the hours with building Castles in the air. Her spirits were
            enlivened by the evident change for the better in Elvira, and her fancy
            presented her with visions bright and pleasing. In these dreams Ambrosio made
            no despicable figure. She thought of him with joy and gratitude; But for every
            idea which fell to the Friar's share, at least two were unconsciously bestowed
            upon Lorenzo. Thus passed the time, till the Bell in the neighbouring Steeple
            of the Capuchin-Cathedral announced the hour of midnight: Antonia remembered
            her Mother's injunctions, and obeyed them, though with reluctance. She undrew
            the curtains with caution. Elvira was enjoying a profound and quiet slumber;
            Her cheek glowed with health's returning colours: A smile declared, that her
            dreams were pleasant, and as Antonia bent over her, She fancied that She heard
            her name pronounced. She kissed her Mother's fore-head softly, and retired to
            her chamber. There She knelt before a Statue of <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0251" n="238"/>St. Rosolia, her Patroness; She
            recommended herself to the protection of heaven, and as had been her custom
            from infancy, concluded her devotions by chaunting the following Stanzas.</p>

          <p>RETURNED UNDISCOVERED TO the Abbey, Ambrosio's mind was filled with the most
            pleasing images. He was wilfully blind to the danger of exposing himself to
            Antonia's charms: He only remembered the pleasure which her society had
            afforded him, and rejoiced in the prospect of that pleasure being repeated. He
            failed not to profit by Elvira's indisposition to obtain a sight of her
            Daughter every day. At first <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0255" n="242"/>He
            bounded his wishes to inspire Antonia with friendship: But no sooner was He
            convinced that She felt that sentiment in its fullest extent, than his aim
            became more decided, and his attentions assumed a warmer colour. The innocent
            familiarity with which She treated him, encouraged his desires: Grown used to
            her modesty, it no longer commanded the same respect and awe: He still admired
            it, but it only made him more anxious to deprive her of that quality, which
            formed her principal charm. Warmth of passion, and natural penetration, of
            which latter unfortunately both for himself and Antonia He possessed an ample
            share, supplied a knowledge of the arts of seduction. He easily distinguished
            the emotions which were favourable to his designs, and seized every means with
            avidity of infusing corruption into Antonia's bosom. This He found no easy
            matter. Extreme simplicity prevented her from perceiving the aim to which the
            Monk's insinuations tended; But the excellent morals <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0256" n="243"/>which She owed to Elvira's care, the
            solidity and correctness of her understanding, and a strong sense of what was
            right implanted in her heart by Nature, made her feel that his precepts must
            be faulty. By a few simple words She frequently overthrew the whole bulk of
            his sophistical arguments, and made him conscious how weak they were when
            opposed to Virtue and Truth. On such occasion He took refuge in his eloquence;
            He over-powered her with a torrent of Philosophical paradoxes, to which, not
            understanding them, it was impossible for her to reply; And thus though He did
            not convince her that his reasoning was just, He at least prevented her from
            discovering it to be false. He perceived that her respect for his judgment
            augmented daily, and doubted not with time to bring her to the point desired. </p>
          <p>He was not unconscious, that his attempts were highly criminal: He saw
            clearly the baseness of seducing the innocent Girl: But his passion was too
            violent to permit his abandoning his design. He resolved to <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0257" n="244"/>pursue it, let the consequences be
            what they might. He depended upon finding Antonia in some unguarded moment;
            And seeing no other Man admitted into her society, nor hearing any mentioned
            either by her or by Elvira, He imagined that her young heart was still
            unoccupied. While He waited for the opportunity of satisfying his
            unwarrantable lust, every day increased his coldness for Matilda. Not a little
            was this occasioned by the consciousness of his faults to her. To hide them
            from her He was not sufficiently master of himself: Yet He dreaded, lest in a
            transport of jealous rage She should betray the secret, on which his character
            and even his life depended. Matilda could not but remark his indifference: He
            was conscious that She remarked it, and fearing her reproaches shunned her
            studiously. Yet when He could not avoid her, her mildness might have convinced
            him that He had nothing to dread from her resentment. She had resumed the
            character of the gentle interesting Rosario: She taxed him not with
            ingratitude; But her eyes <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0258" n="245"/>filled
            with involuntary tears, and the soft melancholy of her countenance and voice
            uttered complaints far more touching than words could have conveyed. Ambrosio
            was not unmoved by her sorrow; But unable to remove its cause, He forbore to
            show that it affected him. As her conduct convinced him that He needed not
            fear her vengeance, He continued to neglect her, and avoided her company with
            care. Matilda saw, that She in vain attempted to regain his affections: Yet
            She stifled the impulse of resentment, and continued to treat her inconstant
            Lover with her former fondness and attention. </p>
          <p>By degrees Elvira's constitution recovered itself. She was no longer troubled
            with convulsions, and Antonia ceased to tremble for her Mother. Ambrosio
            beheld this re-establishment with displeasure. He saw, that Elvira's knowledge
            of the world would not be the Dupe of his sanctified demeanour, and that She
            would easily perceive his views upon her Daughter. He resolved therefore, <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0259" n="246"/> before She quitted her chamber, to
            try the extent of his influence over the innocent Antonia. </p>
          <p>One evening, when He had found Elvira almost perfectly restored to health, He
            quitted her earlier than was his usual custom. Not finding Antonia in the
            Anti- Chamber, He ventured to follow her to her own. It was only separated
            from her Mother's by a Closet, in which Flora, the Waiting-Woman, generally
            slept. Antonia sat upon a Sopha with her back towards the door, and read
            attentively. She heard not his approach, till He had seated himself by her.
            She started, and welcomed him with a look of pleasure: Then rising, She would
            have conducted him to the sitting-room; But Ambrosio taking her hand, obliged
            her by gentle violence to resume her place. She complied without difficulty:
            She knew not, that there was more impropriety in conversing with him in one
            room than another. She thought herself equally secure of his principles and
            her own, and having replaced <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0260" n="247"/>
            herself upon the Sopha, She began to prattle to him with her usual ease and
            vivacity. </p>
          <p>He examined the Book which She had been reading, and had now placed upon the
            Table. It was the Bible. </p>
          <p>`How!' said the Friar to himself; `Antonia reads the Bible, and is still so
            ignorant?' </p>
          <p>But, upon a further inspection, He found that Elvira had made exactly the
            same remark. That prudent Mother, while She admired the beauties of the sacred
            writings, was convinced, that unrestricted no reading more improper could be
            permitted a young Woman. Many of the narratives can only tend to excite ideas
            the worst calculated for a female breast: Every thing is called plainly and
            roundly by its name; and the annals of a Brothel would scarcely furnish a
            greater choice of indecent expressions. Yet this is the Book, which young
            Women are recommended to study; which is put into the hands of Children, able
            to <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0261" n="248"/>comprehend little more than those
            passages of which they had better remain ignorant; and which but too
            frequently inculcates the first rudiments of vice, and gives the first alarm
            to the still sleeping passions. Of this was Elvira so fully convinced, that
            She would have preferred putting into her Daughter's hands `<hi rend="italic"
              >Amadis de Gaul</hi>,' or `<hi rend="italic">The Valiant Champion, Tirante
              the White</hi>;' and would sooner have authorised her studying the lewd
            exploits of `<hi rend="italic">Don Galaor</hi>,' or the lascivious jokes of
            the `<hi rend="italic">Damsel Plazer di mi vida</hi>.' She had in consequence
            made two resolutions respecting the Bible. The first was, that Antonia should
            not read it, till She was of an age to feel its beauties, and profit by its
            morality: The second, that it should be copied out with her own hand, and all
            improper passages either altered or omitted. She had adhered to this
            determination, and such was the Bible which Antonia was reading: It had been
            lately delivered to her, and She perused it with an avidity, with a delight
            that was inexpressible. <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0262" n="249"/>Ambrosio
            perceived his mistake, and replaced the Book upon the Table. </p>
          <p>Antonia spoke of her Mother's health with all the enthusiastic joy of a
            youthful heart. </p>
          <p>`I admire your filial affection,' said the Abbot; `It proves the excellence
            and sensibility of your character; It promises a treasure to him, whom Heaven
            has destined to possess your affections. The Breast, so capable of fondness
            for a Parent, what will it feel for a Lover? Nay, perhaps, what feels it for
            one even now? Tell me, my lovely Daughter; Have you known, what it is to love?
            Answer me with sincerity: Forget my habit, and consider me only as a Friend.' </p>
          <p>`What it is to love?' said She, repeating his question; `Oh! yes,
            undoubtedly; I have loved many, many People.' </p>
          <p>`That is not what I mean. The love of which I speak, can be felt only for
            one. <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0263" n="250"/>Have you never seen the Man,
            whom you wished to be your Husband?' </p>
          <p>`Oh! No, indeed!' </p>
          <p>This was an untruth, but She was unconscious of its falsehood: She knew not
            the nature of her sentiments for Lorenzo; and never having seen him since his
            first visit to Elvira, with every day his Image grew less feebly impressed
            upon her bosom. Besides, She thought of an Husband with all a Virgin's terror,
            and negatived the Friar's demand without a moment's hesitation. </p>
          <p>`And do you not long to see that Man, Antonia? Do you feel no void in your
            heart, which you fain would have filled up? Do you heave no sighs for the
            absence of some one dear to you, but who that some one is, you know not?
            Perceive you not that what formerly could please, has charms for you no
            longer? That a thousand new wishes, new ideas, new sensations, have sprang in
            your bosom, only to be felt, never to be described? Or while you fill every
              <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0264" n="251"/>other heart with passion, is it
            possible that your own remains insensible and cold? It cannot be! That melting
            eye, that blushing cheek, that enchanting voluptuous melancholy which at times
            over-spreads your features, all these marks belye your words. You love,
            Antonia, and in vain would hide it from me.' </p>
          <p>`Father, you amaze me! What is this love of which you speak? I neither know
            its nature, nor if I felt it, why I should conceal the sentiment.' </p>
          <p>`Have you seen no Man, Antonia, whom though never seen before, you seemed
            long to have sought? Whose form, though a Stranger's, was familiar to your
            eyes? The sound of whose voice soothed you, pleased you, penetrated to your
            very soul? In whose presence you rejoiced, for whose absence you lamented?
            With whom your heart seemed to expand, and in whose bosom with confidence
            unbounded you reposed the cares of your own? Have you not felt all this,
            Antonia?' </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0265" n="252"/>`Certainly I have: The first time
            that I saw you, I felt it.' </p>
          <p>Ambrosio started. Scarcely dared He credit his hearing. </p>
          <p>`Me, Antonia?' He cried, his eyes sparkling with delight and impatience,
            while He seized her hand, and pressed it rapturously to his lips. `Me,
            Antonia? You felt these sentiments for me?' </p>
          <p>`Even with more strength than you have described. The very moment that I
            beheld you, I felt so pleased, so interested! I waited so eagerly to catch the
            sound of your voice, and when I heard it, it seemed so sweet! It spoke to me a
            language till then so unknown! Methought, it told me a thousand things which I
            wished to hear! It seemed as if I had long known you; as if I had a right to
            your friendship, your advice, and your protection. I wept when you departed,
            and longed for the time which should restore you to my sight.' </p>
          <p>`Antonia! my charming Antonia!' exclaimed the Monk, and caught her to <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0266" n="253"/>his bosom; `Can I believe my senses?
            Repeat it to me, my sweet Girl! Tell me again that you love me, that you love
            me truly and tenderly!' </p>
          <p>`Indeed, I do: Let my Mother be excepted, and the world holds no one more
            dear to me!' </p>
          <p>At this frank avowal Ambrosio no longer possessed himself; Wild with desire,
            He clasped the blushing Trembler in his arms. He fastened his lips greedily
            upon hers, sucked in her pure delicious breath, violated with his bold hand
            the treasures of her bosom, and wound around him her soft and yielding limbs.
            Startled, alarmed, and confused at his action, surprize at first deprived her
            of the power of resistance. At length recovering herself, She strove to escape
            from his embrace. </p>
          <p>`Father! . . . . Ambrosio!' She cried; `Release me, for God's sake!' </p>
          <p>But the licentious Monk heeded not her prayers: He persisted in his design,
            and proceeded to take still greater liberties. <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0267" n="254"/>Antonia prayed, wept, and struggled:
            Terrified to the extreme, though at what She knew not, She exerted all her
            strength to repulse the Friar, and was on the point of shrieking for
            assistance, when the chamber-door was suddenly thrown open. Ambrosio had just
            sufficient presence of mind to be sensible of his danger. Reluctantly He
            quitted his prey, and started hastily from the Couch. Antonia uttered an
            exclamation of joy, flew towards the door, and found herself clasped in the
            arms of her Mother. </p>
          <p>Alarmed at some of the Abbot's speeches, which Antonia had innocently
            repeated, Elvira resolved to ascertain the truth of her suspicions. She had
            known enough of Mankind, not to be imposed upon by the Monk's reputed virtue.
            She reflected on several circumstances, which though trifling, on being put
            together seemed to authorize her fears. His frequent visits, which as far as
            She could see, were confined to her family; His evident emotion, whenever She
              <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0268" n="255"/>spoke of Antonia; His being in the
            full prime and heat of Manhood; and above all, his pernicious philosophy
            communicated to her by Antonia, and which accorded but ill with his
            conversation in her presence, all these circumstances inspired her with doubts
            respecting the purity of Ambrosio's friendship. In consequence, She resolved,
            when He should next be alone with Antonia, to endeavour at surprizing him. Her
            plan had succeeded. 'Tis true, that when She entered the room, He had already
            abandoned his prey; But the disorder of her Daughter's dress, and the shame
            and confusion stamped upon the Friar's countenance sufficed to prove, that her
            suspicions were but too well- founded. However, She was too prudent to make
            those suspicions known. She judged, that to unmask the Imposter would be no
            easy matter, the public being so much prejudiced in his favour: and having but
            few Friends, She thought it dangerous to make herself so powerful an Enemy.
            She affected <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0269" n="256"/>therefore not to remark
            his agitation, seated herself tranquilly upon the Sopha, assigned some
            trifling reason for having quitted her room unexpectedly, and conversed on
            various subjects with seeming confidence and ease. </p>
          <p>Re-assured by her behaviour, the Monk began to recover himself. He strove to
            answer Elvira without appearing embarrassed: But He was still too great a
            novice in dissimulation, and He felt, that He must look confused and awkward.
            He soon broke off the conversation, and rose to depart. What was his vexation,
            when on taking leave, Elvira told him in polite terms, that being now
            perfectly re-established, She thought it an injustice to deprive Others of his
            company, who might be more in need of it! She assured him of her eternal
            gratitude, for the benefit which during her illness She had derived from his
            society and exhortations: And She lamented that her domestic affairs, as well
            as the multitude of business which his situation must of necessity impose <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0270" n="257"/>upon him, would in future deprive her
            of the pleasure of his visits. Though delivered in the mildest language this
            hint was too plain to be mistaken. Still He was preparing to put in a
            remonstrance, when an expressive look from Elvira stopped him short. He dared
            not press her to receive him, for her manner convinced him that He was
            discovered: He submitted without reply, took an hasty leave, and retired to
            the Abbey, his heart filled with rage and shame, with bitterness and
            disappointment. </p>
          <p>Antonia's mind felt relieved by his departure; Yet She could not help
            lamenting, that She was never to see him more. Elvira also felt a secret
            sorrow; She had received too much pleasure from thinking him her Friend, not
            to regret the necessity of changing her opinion: But her mind was too much
            accustomed to the fallacy of worldly friendships to permit her present
            disappointment to weigh upon it long. She now endeavoured to make her Daughter
            aware of the risque, which She had ran: But She was <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0271" n="258"/>obliged to treat the subject with
            caution, lest in removing the bandage of ignorance, the veil of innocence
            should be rent away. She therefore contented herself with warning Antonia to
            be upon her guard, and ordering her, should the Abbot persist in his visits,
            never to receive them but in company. With this injunction Antonia promised to
            comply. </p>
          <p>Ambrosio hastened to his Cell. He closed the door after him, and threw
            himself upon the bed in despair. The impulse of desire, the stings of
            disappointment, the shame of detection, and the fear of being publicly
            unmasked, rendered his bosom a scene of the most horrible confusion. He knew
            not what course to pursue. Debarred the presence of Antonia, He had no hopes
            of satisfying that passion, which was now become a part of his existence. He
            reflected, that his secret was in a Woman's power: He trembled with
            apprehension when He beheld the precipice before him, and with rage, when He
            thought that had it not been <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0272" n="258"/>for
            Elvira, He should now have possessed the object of his desires. With the
            direct imprecations He vowed vengeance against her; He swore, that cost what
            it would, He still would possess Antonia. Starting from the Bed He paced the
            chamber with disordered steps, howled with impotent fury, dashed himself
            violently against the walls, and indulged all the transports of rage and
            madness. </p>
          <p>He was still under the influence of this storm of passions, when He heard a
            gentle knock at the door of his Cell. Conscious that his voice must have been
            heard, He dared not refuse admittance to the Importuner: He strove to compose
            himself, and to hide his agitation. Having in some degree succeeded, He drew
            back the bolt: The door opened, and Matilda appeared. </p>
          <p>At this precise moment there was no one with whose presence He could better
            have dispensed. He had not sufficient command over himself to conceal his
            vexation. He started back, and frowned. </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0273" n="260"/>`I am busy,' said He in a stern and
            hasty tone; `Leave me!' </p>
          <p>Matilda heeded him not: She again fastened the door, and then advanced
            towards him with an air gentle and supplicating. </p>
          <p>`Forgive me, Ambrosio,' said She; `For your own sake I must not obey you.
            Fear no complaints from me; I come not to reproach you with your ingratitude.
            I pardon you from my heart, and since your love can no longer be mine, I
            request the next best gift, your confidence and friendship. We cannot force
            our inclinations; The little beauty which you once saw in me, has perished
            with its novelty, and if it can no longer excite desire, mine is the fault,
            not yours. But why persist in shunning me? Why such anxiety to fly my
            presence? You have sorrows, but will not permit me to share them; You have
            disappointments, but will not accept my comfort; You have wishes, but forbid
            my aiding your pursuits. 'Tis of this which I complain, not of your
            indifference to my person. I have given <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0274"
              n="261"/>up the claims of the Mistress, but nothing shall prevail on me to
            give up those of the Friend.' </p>
          <p>Her mildness had an instantaneous effect upon Ambrosio's feelings. </p>
          <p>`Generous Matilda!' He replied, taking her hand, `How far do you rise
            superior to the foibles of your sex! Yes, I accept your offer. I have need of
            an adviser, and a Confident: In you I find every needful quality united. But
            to aid my pursuits . . . . Ah! Matilda, it lies not in your power!' </p>
          <p>`It lies in no one's power but mine. Ambrosio, your secret is none to me;
            Your every step, your every action has been observed by my attentive eye. You
            love.' </p>
          <p>`Matilda!' </p>
          <p>`Why conceal it from me? Fear not the little jealousy, which taints the
            generality of Women: My soul disdains so despicable a passion. You love,
            Ambrosio; Antonia Dalfa is the object of your flame. I know every circumstance
            respecting your passion: Every conversation has been repeated to me. I have
            been informed of <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0275" n="262"/>your attempt to
            enjoy Antonia's person, your disappointment, and dismission from Elvira's
            House. You now despair of possessing your Mistress; But I come to revive your
            hopes, and point out the road to success.' </p>
          <p>`To success? Oh! impossible!' </p>
          <p>`To them who dare nothing is impossible. Rely upon me, and you may yet be
            happy. The time is come, Ambrosio, when regard for your comfort and
            tranquillity compels me to reveal a part of my History, with which you are
            still unacquainted. Listen, and do not interrupt me: Should my confession
            disgust you, remember that in making it my sole aim is to satisfy your wishes,
            and restore that peace to your heart, which at present has abandoned it. I
            formerly mentioned, that my Guardian was a Man of uncommon knowledge: He took
            pains to instil that knowledge into my infant mind. Among the various sciences
            which curiosity had induced him to explore, He neglected not that, which by
              <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0276" n="263"/>most is esteemed impious, and by
            many chimerical. I speak of those arts, which relate to the world of Spirits.
            His deep researches into causes and effects, his unwearied application to the
            study of natural philosophy, his profound and unlimited knowledge of the
            properties and virtues of every gem which enriches the deep, of every herb
            which the earth produces, at length procured him the distinction, which He had
            sought so long, so earnestly. His curiosity was fully slaked, his ambition
            amply gratified. He gave laws to the elements; He could reverse the order of
            nature; His eye read the mandates of futurity, and the infernal Spirits were
            submissive to his commands. Why shrink you from me? I understand that
            enquiring look. Your suspicions are right, though your terrors are unfounded.
            My Guardian concealed not from me his most precious acquisition. Yet had I
            never seen <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, I should never have exerted my power.
            Like you I shuddered at the thoughts of Magic: Like you <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0277" n="264"/>I had formed a terrible idea of the
            consequences of raising a d&aelig;mon. To preserve that life which your
            love had taught me to prize, I had recourse to means which I trembled at
            employing. You remember that night, which I past in St. Clare's Sepulchre?
            Then was it, that surrounded by mouldering bodies, I dared to perform those
            mystic rites, which summoned to my aid a fallen Angel. Judge what must have
            been my joy at discovering, that my terrors were imaginary: I saw the
            D&aelig;mon obedient to my orders, I saw him trembling at my frown, and
            found, that instead of selling my soul to a Master, my courage had purchased
            for myself a Slave.' </p>
          <p>`Rash Matilda! What have you done? You have doomed yourself to endless
            perdition; You have bartered for momentary power eternal happiness! If on
            witchcraft depends the fruition of my desires, I renounce your aid most
            absolutely. The consequences are too horrible: I doat upon Antonia, but am not
            so blinded by <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0278" n="265"/> lust, as to sacrifice
            for her enjoyment my existence both in this world and the next.' </p>
          <p>`Ridiculous prejudices! Oh! blush, Ambrosio, blush at being subjected to
            their dominion. Where is the risque of accepting my offers? What should induce
            my persuading you to this step, except the wish of restoring you to happiness
            and quiet. If there is danger, it must fall upon me: It is I, who invoke the
            ministry of the Spirits; Mine therefore will be the crime, and yours the
            profit. But danger there is none: The Enemy of Mankind is my Slave, not my
            Sovereign. Is there no difference between giving and receiving laws, between
            serving and commanding? Awake from your idle dreams, Ambrosio! Throw from you
            these terrors so ill-suited to a soul like yours; Leave them for common Men,
            and dare to be happy! Accompany me this night to St. Clare's Sepulchre,
            witness my incantations, and Antonia is your own.' </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0279" n="266"/>`To obtain her by such means I
            neither can, or will. Cease then to persuade me, for I dare not employ Hell's
            agency. </p>
          <p>`You <hi rend="italic">dare</hi> not? How have you deceived me! That mind
            which I esteemed so great and valiant, proves to be feeble, puerile, and
            grovelling, a slave to vulgar errors, and weaker than a Woman's.' </p>
          <p>`What? Though conscious of the danger, wilfully shall I expose myself to the
            Seducer's arts? Shall I renounce for ever my title to salvation? Shall my eyes
            seek a sight, which I know will blast them? No, no, Matilda; I will not ally
            myself with God's Enemy.' </p>
          <p>`Are you then God's Friend at present? Have you not broken your engagements
            with him, renounced his service, and abandoned yourself to the impulse of your
            passions? Are you not planning the destruction of innocence, the ruin of a
            Creature, whom He formed in the mould of Angels? If not of D&aelig;mons,
            whose aid would you invoke to forward this laudable design? Will <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0280" n="267"/>the Seraphims protect it, conduct
            Antonia to your arms, and sanction with their ministry your illicit pleasures?
            Absurd! But I am not deceived, Ambrosio! It is not virtue, which makes you
            reject my offer: You <hi rend="italic">would</hi> accept it, but you <hi
              rend="italic">dare</hi> not. 'Tis not the crime which holds your hand, but
            the punishment; 'Tis not respect for God which restrains you, but the terror
            of his vengeance! Fain would you offend him in secret, but you tremble to
            profess yourself his Foe. Now shame on the coward soul, which wants the
            courage either to be a firm Friend, or open Enemy!' </p>
          <p>`To look upon guilt with horror, Matilda, is in itself a merit: In this
            respect I glory to confess myself a Coward. Though my passions have made me
            deviate from her laws, I still feel in my heart an innate love of virtue. But
            it ill becomes you to tax me with my perjury: You, who first seduced me to
            violate my vows; You, who first rouzed my sleeping vices, made me feel the
            weight of Religion's chains, and bade me <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0281"
              n="268"/>be convinced that guilt had pleasures. Yet though my principles
            have yielded to the force of temperament, I still have sufficient grace to
            shudder at Sorcery, and avoid a crime so monstrous, so unpardonable!' </p>
          <p>`Unpardonable, say you? Where then is your constant boast of the Almighty's
            infinite mercy? Has He of late set bounds to it? Receives He no longer a
            Sinner with joy? You injure him, Ambrosio; You will always have time to
            repent, and He have goodness to forgive. Afford him a glorious opportunity to
            exert that goodness: The greater your crime, the greater his merit in
            pardoning. Away then with these childish scruples: Be persuaded to your good,
            and follow me to the Sepulchre.' </p>
          <p>`Oh! cease, Matilda! That scoffing tone, that bold and impious language is
            horrible in every mouth, but most so in a Woman's. Let us drop a conversation,
            which excites no other sentiments than horror and disgust. I will not follow
            you to the Sepulchre, or accept the services of <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0282" n="269"/>your infernal Agents. Antonia shall be
            mine, but mine by human means.' </p>
          <p>`Then yours She will never be! You are banished her presence; Her Mother has
            opened her eyes to your designs, and She is now upon her guard against them.
            Nay more, She loves another. A Youth of distinguished merit, possesses her
            heart, and unless you interfere, a few days will make her his Bride. This
            intelligence was brought me by my invisible Servants, to whom I had recourse
            on first perceiving your indifference. They watched your every action, related
            to me all that past at Elvira's, and inspired me with the idea of favouring
            your designs. Their reports have been my only comfort. Though you shunned my
            presence, all your proceedings were known to me: Nay, I was constantly with
            you in some degree, thanks to this precious gift!' </p>
          <p>With these words She drew from beneath her habit a mirror of polished steel,
            the <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0283" n="270"/>borders of which were marked
            with various strange and unknown characters. </p>
          <p>`Amidst all my sorrows, amidst all my regrets for your coldness, I was
            sustained from despair by the virtues of this Talisman. On pronouncing certain
            words the Person appears in it, on whom the Observer's thoughts are bent: thus
            though <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was exiled from <hi rend="italic">your</hi>
            sight, you, Ambrosio, were ever present to mine.' </p>
          <p>The Friar's curiosity was excited strongly. </p>
          <p>`What you relate is incredible! Matilda, are you not amusing yourself with my
            credulity?' </p>
          <p>`Be your own eyes the Judge.' </p>
          <p>She put the Mirror into his hand. Curiosity induced him to take it, and Love,
            to wish that Antonia might appear. Matilda pronounced the magic words.
            Immediately, a thick smoke rose from the characters traced upon the borders,
            and spread itself over the surface. It dispersed again gradually; A confused
            mixture of colours and <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0284" n="271"/>images
            presented themselves to the Friar's eyes, which at length arranging themselves
            in their proper places, He beheld in miniature Antonia's lovely form. </p>
          <p>The scene was a small closet belonging to her apartment. She was undressing
            to bathe herself. The long tresses of her hair were already bound up. The
            amorous Monk had full opportunity to observe the voluptuous contours and
            admirable symmetry of her person. She threw off her last garment, and
            advancing to the Bath prepared for her, She put her foot into the water. It
            struck cold, and She drew it back again. Though unconscious of being observed,
            an in-bred sense of modesty induced her to veil her charms; and She stood
            hesitating upon the brink, in the attitude of the Venus de Medicis. At this
            moment a tame Linnet flew towards her, nestled its head between her breasts,
            and nibbled them in wanton play. The smiling Antonia strove in vain to shake
            off the Bird, and at length raised her hands to drive it <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0285" n="272"/>from its delightful harbour. Ambrosio
            could bear no more: His desires were worked up to phrenzy. </p>
          <p>`I yield!' He cried, dashing the mirror upon the ground: `Matilda, I follow
            you! Do with me what you will!' </p>
          <p>She waited not to hear his consent repeated. It was already midnight. She
            flew to her Cell, and soon returned with her little basket and the Key of the
            Cemetery, which had remained in her possession since her first visit to the
            Vaults. She gave the Monk no time for reflection. </p>
          <p>`Come!' She said, and took his hand; `Follow me, and witness the effects of
            your resolve!' </p>
          <p>This said, She drew him hastily along. They passed into the Burying-ground
            unobserved, opened the door of the Sepulchre, and found themselves at the head
            of the subterraneous Stair-case. As yet the beams of the full Moon had guided
            their steps, but that resource now failed them. Matilda had neglected to
            provide herself with a <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0286" n="273"/> Lamp. Still
            holding Ambrosio's hand She descended the marble steps; But the profound
            obscurity with which they were over-spread, obliged them to walk slow and
            cautiously. </p>
          <p>`You tremble!' said Matilda to her Companion; `Fear not; The destined spot is
            near.' </p>
          <p>They reached the foot of the Stair-case, and continued to proceed, feeling
            their way along the Walls. On turning a corner suddenly, they descried faint
            gleams of light, which seemed burning at a distance. Thither they bent their
            steps: The rays proceeded from a small sepulchral Lamp, which flamed
            unceasingly before the Statue of St. Clare. It tinged with dim and cheerless
            beams the massy Columns which supported the Roof, but was too feeble to
            dissipate the thick gloom, in which the Vaults above were buried. </p>
          <p>Matilda took the Lamp. </p>
          <p>`Wait for me!' said She to the Friar; `In a few moments I am here again.' </p>
          <p>With these words She hastened into one <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0287"
              n="274"/>of the passages which branched in various directions from this
            spot, and formed a sort of Labyrinth. Ambrosio was now left alone: Darkness
            the most profound surrounded him, and encouraged the doubts, which began to
            revive in his bosom. He had been hurried away by the delirium of the moment:
            The shame of betraying his terrors, while in Matilda's presence, had induced
            him to repress them; But now that he was abandoned to himself, they resumed
            their former ascendancy. He trembled at the scene, which He was soon to
            witness. He knew not how far the delusions of Magic might operate upon his
            mind, and possibly might force him to some deed, whose commission would make
            the breach between himself and Heaven irreparable. In this fearful dilemma, He
            would have implored God's assistance, but was conscious that He had forfeited
            all claim to such protection. Gladly would He have returned to the Abbey; But
            as He had past through innumerable Caverns and winding passages, the <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0288" n="275"/>attempt of regaining the Stairs was
            hopeless. His fate was determined: No possibility of escape presented itself:
            He therefore combated his apprehensions, and called every argument to his
            succour, which might enable him to support the trying scene with fortitude. He
            reflected, that Antonia would be the reward of his daring: He inflamed his
            imagination by enumerating her charms. He persuaded himself, that, [as Matilda
            had observed,] He always should have time sufficient for repentance, and that
            as He employed <hi rend="italic">her</hi> assistance, not that of the
            D&aelig;mons, the crime of Sorcery could not be laid to his charge. He had
            read much respecting witchcraft: He understood that unless a formal Act was
            signed renouncing his claim to salvation, Satan would have no power over him.
            He was fully determined not to execute any such act, whatever threats might be
            used, or advantages held out to him. </p>
          <p>Such were his meditations, while waiting for Matilda. They were interrupted
            by a <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0289" n="276"/>low murmur, which seemed at no
            great distance from him. He was startled. He listened. Some minutes past in
            silence, after which the murmur was repeated. It appeared to be the groaning
            of one in pain. In any other situation, this circumstance would only have
            excited his attention and curiosity: In the present, his predominant sensation
            was that of terror. His imagination totally engrossed by the ideas of sorcery
            and Spirits, He fancied that some unquiet Ghost was wandering near him; or
            else, that Matilda had fallen a Victim to her presumption, and was perishing
            under the cruel fangs of the D&aelig;mons. The noise seemed not to
            approach, but continued to be heard at intervals. Sometimes it became more
            audible, doubtless, as the sufferings of the person who uttered the groans
            became more acute and insupportable. Ambrosio now and then thought, that He
            could distinguish accents; and once in particular He was almost convinced,
            that He heard a faint voice exclaim, </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0290" n="277"/>`God! Oh! God! No hope! No
            succour!' </p>
          <p>Yet deeper groans followed these words. They died away gradually, and
            universal silence again prevailed. </p>
          <p>`What can this mean?' thought the bewildered Monk. </p>
          <p>At that moment an idea which flashed into his mind, almost petrified him with
            horror. He started, and shuddered at himself. </p>
          <p>`Should it be possible!' He groaned involuntarily; `Should it but be
            possible, Oh! what a Monster am I!' </p>
          <p>He wished to resolve his doubts, and to repair his fault, if it were not too
            late already: But these generous and compassionate sentiments were soon put to
            flight by the return of Matilda. He forgot the groaning Sufferer, and
            remembered nothing but the danger and embarrassment of his own situation. The
            light of the returning Lamp gilded the walls, and in a few moments after
            Matilda stood beside him. <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0291" n="278"/>She had
            quitted her religious habit: She was now cloathed in a long sable Robe, on
            which was traced in gold embroidery a variety of unknown characters: It was
            fastened by a girdle of precious stones, in which was fixed a poignard. Her
            neck and arms were uncovered. In her hand She bore a golden wand. Her hair was
            loose and flowed wildly upon her shoulders; Her eyes sparkled with terrific
            expression; and her whole Demeanour was calculated to inspire the beholder
            with awe and admiration. </p>
          <p>`Follow me!' She said to the Monk in a low and solemn voice; `All is ready!' </p>
          <p>His limbs trembled, while He obeyed her. She led him through various narrow
            passages; and on every side as they past along, the beams of the Lamp
            displayed none but the most revolting objects; Skulls, Bones, Graves, and
            Images whose eyes seemed to glare on them with horror and surprize. At length
            they reached a spacious Cavern, whose lofty roof the eye sought <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0292" n="279"/>in vain to discover. A profound
            obscurity hovered through the void. Damp vapours struck cold to the Friar's
            heart; and He listened sadly to the blast, while it howled along the lonely
            Vaults. Here Matilda stopped. She turned to Ambrosio. His cheeks and lips were
            pale with apprehension. By a glance of mingled scorn and anger She reproved
            his pusillanimity, but She spoke not. She placed the Lamp upon the ground,
            near the Basket. She motioned that Ambrosio should be silent, and began the
            mysterious rites. She drew a circle round him, another round herself, and then
            taking a small Phial from the Basket, poured a few drops upon the ground
            before her. She bent over the place, muttered some indistinct sentences, and
            immediately a pale sulphurous flame arose from the ground. It increased by
            degrees, and at length spread its waves over the whole surface, the circles
            alone excepted in which stood Matilda and the Monk. It then ascended the huge
            Columns of unhewn stone, glided along the <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0293"
              n="280"/>roof, and formed the Cavern into an immense chamber totally covered
            with blue trembling fire. It emitted no heat: On the contrary, the extreme
            chillness of the place seemed to augment with every moment. Matilda continued
            her incantations: At intervals She took various articles from the Basket, the
            nature and name of most of which were unknown to the Friar: But among the few
            which He distinguished, He particularly observed three human fingers, and an
            Agnus Dei which She broke in pieces. She threw them all into the flames which
            burned before her, and they were instantly consumed. </p>
          <p>The Monk beheld her with anxious curiosity. Suddenly She uttered a loud and
            piercing shriek. She appeared to be seized with an access of delirium; She
            tore her hair, beat her bosom, used the most frantic gestures, and drawing the
            poignard from her girdle plunged it into her left arm. The blood gushed out
            plentifully, and as She stood on the brink of the circle, She <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0294" n="281"/>took care that it should fall on the
            outside. The flames retired from the spot on which the blood was pouring. A
            volume of dark clouds rose slowly from the ensanguined earth, and ascended
            gradually, till it reached the vault of the Cavern. At the same time a clap of
            thunder was heard: The echo pealed fearfully along the subterraneous passages,
            and the ground shook beneath the feet of the Enchantress. </p>
          <p>It was now that Ambrosio repented of his rashness. The solemn singularity of
            the charm had prepared him for something strange and horrible. He waited with
            fear for the Spirit's appearance, whose coming was announced by thunder and
            earthquakes. He looked wildly round him, expecting that some dreadful
            Apparition would meet his eyes, the sight of which would drive him mad. A cold
            shivering seized his body, and He sank upon one knee, unable to support
            himself. </p>
          <p>`He comes!' exclaimed Matilda in a joyful accent. </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0295" n="282"/>Ambrosio started, and expected the
            D&aelig;mon with terror. What was his surprize, when the Thunder ceasing
            to roll, a full strain of melodious Music sounded in the air. At the same time
            the cloud dispersed, and He beheld a Figure more beautiful, than Fancy's
            pencil ever drew. It was a Youth seemingly scarce eighteen, the perfection of
            whose form and face was unrivalled. He was perfectly naked: A bright Star
            sparkled upon his fore-head; Two crimson wings extended themselves from his
            shoulders; and his silken locks were confined by a band of many- coloured
            fires, which played round his head, formed themselves into a variety of
            figures, and shone with a brilliance far surpassing that of precious Stones.
            Circlets of Diamonds were fastened round his arms and ankles, and in his right
            hand He bore a silver branch, imitating Myrtle. His form shone with dazzling
            glory: He was surrounded by clouds of rose-coloured light, and at the moment
            that He appeared, a refreshing air breathed <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0296"
              n="283"/> perfumes through the Cavern. Enchanted at a vision so contrary to
            his expectations, Ambrosio gazed upon the Spirit with delight and wonder: Yet
            however beautiful the Figure, He could not but remark a wildness in the
            D&aelig;mon's eyes, and a mysterious melancholy impressed upon his
            features, betraying the Fallen Angel, and inspiring the Spectators with secret
            awe. </p>
          <p>The Music ceased. Matilda addressed herself to the Spirit: She spoke in a
            language unintelligible to the Monk, and was answered in the same. She seemed
            to insist upon something, which the D&aelig;mon was unwilling to grant. He
            frequently darted upon Ambrosio angry glances, and at such times the Friar's
            heart sank within him. Matilda appeared to grow incensed. She spoke in a loud
            and commanding tone, and her gestures declared, that She was threatening him
            with her vengeance. Her menaces had the desired effect: The Spirit sank upon
            his knee, and with a submissive air presented to her the branch of Myrtle. No
              <pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0297" n="284"/>sooner had She received it, than
            the Music was again heard; A thick cloud spread itself over the Apparition;
            The blue flames disappeared, and total obscurity reigned through the Cave. The
            Abbot moved not from his place: His faculties were all bound up in pleasure,
            anxiety, and surprize. At length the darkness dispersing, He perceived Matilda
            standing near him in her religious habit, with the Myrtle in her hand. No
            traces of the incantation, and the Vaults were only illuminated by the faint
            rays of the sepulchral Lamp. </p>
          <p>`I have succeeded,' said Matilda, `though with more difficulty than I
            expected. Lucifer, whom I summoned to my assistance, was at first unwilling to
            obey my commands: To enforce his compliance I was constrained to have recourse
            to my strongest charms. They have produced the desired effect, but I have
            engaged never more to invoke his agency in your favour. Beware then, how you
            employ an opportunity which never will return. My magic <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0298" n="285"/>arts will now be of no use to you: In
            future you can only hope for supernatural aid, by invoking the
            D&aelig;mons yourself, and accepting the conditions of their service. This
            you will never do: You want strength of mind to force them to obedience, and
            unless you pay their established price, they will not be your voluntary
            Servants. In this one instance they consent to obey you: I offer you the means
            of enjoying your Mistress, and be careful not to lose the opportunity. Receive
            this constellated Myrtle: While you bear this in your hand, every door will
            fly open to you. It will procure you access tomorrow night to Antonia's
            chamber: Then breathe upon it thrice, pronounce her name, and place it upon
            her pillow. A death-like slumber will immediately seize upon her, and deprive
            her of the power of resisting your attempts. Sleep will hold her till break of
            Morning. In this state you may satisfy your desires without danger of being
            discovered; since when day-light shall dispel the effects of the
              enchantment,<pb entity="DSSR_000002619_0299" n="286"/> Antonia will perceive
            her dishonour, but be ignorant of the Ravisher. Be happy then, my Ambrosio,
            and let this service convince you, that my friendship is disinterested and
            pure. The night must be near expiring: Let us return to the Abbey, lest our
            absence should create surprize.' </p>
          <p>The Abbot received the talisman with silent gratitude. His ideas were too
            much bewildered by the adventures of the night, to permit his expressing his
            thanks audibly, or indeed as yet to feel the whole value of her present.
            Matilda took up her Lamp and Basket, and guided her Companion from the
            mysterious Cavern. She restored the Lamp to its former place, and continued
            her route in darkness, till She reached the foot of the Stair-case. The first
            beams of the rising Sun darting down it facilitated the ascent. Matilda and
            the Abbot hastened out of the Sepulchre, closed the door after them, and soon
            regained the Abbey's western Cloister. No one met them, and <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002619_0300" n="287"/>they retired unobserved to their
            respective Cells. </p>
          <p>The confusion of Ambrosio's mind now began to appease. He rejoiced in the
            fortunate issue of his adventure, and reflecting upon the virtues of the
            Myrtle, looked upon Antonia as already in his power. Imagination retraced to
            him those secret charms, betrayed to him by the Enchanted Mirror, and He
            waited with impatience for the approach of midnight.</p>
