<p>Note:  On page 299, paragraph 13 reads: "Well, then?"  "Yes; I 
remember." and I have changed it to two separate paragraphs, the 
first being "Yes; I remember." and the second being "Well, then?" 
On page 300, paragraph 5, line 1, I have changed "mustache" to 
"moustache" for consistency with other occurrences of the same 
word.  On page 305, paragraph 5, line 2, I have changed 
"philanthrophy" to "philanthropy."  On page 308, paragraph 9, I 
have changed the single quotation mark at the end of the 
paragraph to a double quotation mark: murder?' to murder?"</p>

<p>HUBERT GRANICE, pacing the length of his pleasant lamp-lit 
library, 
paused to compare his watch with the clock on the 
chimney-piece.</p><p> 
     Three minutes to eight.</p><p> 
     In exactly three minutes Mr. Peter Ascham, of the eminent 
legal firm of Ascham and Pettilow, would have his punctual hand 
on 
the door-bell of the flat.  It was a comfort to reflect that 
Ascham 
was so punctual&mdash;the suspense was beginning to make his host 
nervous.  And the sound of the door-bell would be the beginning 
of 
the end&mdash;after that there'd be no going back, by God&mdash;no going 
back!</p><p> 
     Granice resumed his pacing.  Each time he reached the end of 
the room opposite the door he caught his reflection in the 
Florentine mirror above the fine old walnut <hi rend="italic">credence</hi>he had 
picked up at Dijon&mdash;saw himself spare, quick-moving, carefully 
brushed and dressed, but furrowed, gray about the temples, with a 
stoop which he corrected by a spasmodic straightening of the 
shoulders whenever a glass confronted him: a tired middle-aged 
man, 
baffled, beaten, worn out.</p><p> 
     As he summed himself up thus for the third or fourth time 
the 
door opened and he turned with a thrill of relief to greet his 
guest.  But it was only the man-servant who entered, advancing 
silently over the mossy surface of the old Turkey rug.</p><p> 
     "Mr. Ascham telephones, sir, to say he's unexpectedly 
detained 
and can't be here till eight-thirty."</p><p> 
     Granice made a curt gesture of annoyance.  It was becoming 
harder and harder for him to control these reflexes.  He turned 
on 
his heel, tossing to the servant over his shoulder: "Very good.  
Put off dinner."</p><p> 
     Down his spine he felt the man's injured stare.  Mr. Granice 
had always been so mild-spoken to his people&mdash;no doubt the odd 
change in his manner had already been noticed and discussed below 
stairs.  And very likely they suspected the cause.  He stood 
drumming on the writing-table till he heard the servant go out; 
then he threw himself into a chair, propping his elbows on the 
table and resting his chin on his locked hands.</p><p> 
     Another half hour alone with it!</p><p> 
     He wondered irritably what could have detained his guest.  
Some professional matter, no doubt&mdash;the punctilious lawyer would 
have allowed nothing less to interfere with a dinner engagement, 
more especially since Granice, in his note, had said: "I shall 
want 
a little business chat afterward."</p><p> 
     But what professional matter could have come up at that 
unprofessional hour?  Perhaps some other soul in misery had 
called 
on the lawyer; and, after all, Granice's note had given no hint 
of 
his own need!  No doubt Ascham thought he merely wanted to make 
another change in his will.  Since he had come into his little 
property, ten years earlier, Granice had been perpetually 
tinkering 
with his will.</p><p> 
     Suddenly another thought pulled him up, sending a flush to 
his 
sallow temples.  He remembered a word he had tossed to the lawyer 
some six weeks earlier, at the Century Club.  "Yes&mdash;my play's as 
good as taken.  I shall be calling on you soon to go over the 
contract.  Those theatrical chaps are so slippery&mdash;I won't trust 
anybody but you to tie the knot for me!"  That, of course, was 
what 
Ascham would think he was wanted for.  Granice, at the idea, 
broke 
into an audible laugh&mdash;a queer stage-laugh, like the cackle of a 
baffled villain in a melodrama.  The absurdity, the unnaturalness 
of the sound abashed him, and he compressed his lips angrily.  
Would he take to soliloquy next?</p><p> 
     He lowered his arms and pulled open the upper drawer of the 
writing-table.  In the right-hand corner lay a thick manuscript, 
bound in paper folders, and tied with a string beneath which a 
letter had been slipped.  Next to the manuscript was a small 
revolver.  Granice stared a moment at these oddly associated 
objects; then he <pb n="289"/>  took the letter from under 
the string and 
slowly began to open it.  He had known he should do so from the 
moment his hand touched the drawer.  Whenever his eye fell on 
that 
letter some relentless force compelled him to re-read it.</p><p> 
     It was dated about four weeks back, under the letter-head of 
"The Diversity Theatre." 
"MY DEAR MR. GRANICE:</p><p> 
     "I have given the matter my best consideration for the last 
month, and it's no use&mdash;the play won't do.  I have talked it over 
with Miss Melrose&mdash;and you know there isn't a gamer artist on our 
stage&mdash;and I regret to tell you she feels just as I do about it.  
It isn't the poetry that scares her&mdash;or me either.  We both want 
to 
do all we can to help along the poetic drama&mdash;we believe the 
public's ready for it, and we're willing to take a big financial 
risk in order to be the first to give them what they want.  
<hi rend="italic">But 
we don't believe they could be made to want this.</hi> The fact 
is, 
there isn't enough drama in your play to the allowance of 
poetry&mdash; 
the thing drags all through.  You've got a big idea, but it's not 
out of swaddling clothes.</p><p> 
     "If this was your first play I'd say: <hi rend="italic">Try again</hi>.  But 
it 
has been just the same with all the others you've shown me.  And 
you remember the result of 'The Lee Shore,' where you carried all 
the expenses of production yourself, and we couldn't fill the 
theatre for a week.  Yet 'The Lee Shore' was a modern problem 
play--much easier to swing than blank verse.  It isn't as if you 
hadn't 
tried all kinds&mdash;"</p><p> 
     Granice folded the letter and put it carefully back into the 
envelope.  Why on earth was he re-reading it, when he knew every 
phrase in it by heart, when for a month past he had seen it, 
night 
after night, stand out in letters of flame against the darkness 
of 
his sleepless lids?</p><p> 
     <hi rend="italic">"It has been just the same with all the others you've 
shown 
me."</hi></p><p> 
     That was the way they dismissed ten years of passionate 
unremitting work!</p><p> 
     <hi rend="italic">"You remember the result of 'The Lee Shore.'"</hi></p><p> 
     Good God&mdash;as if he were likely to forget it!  He re-lived it 
all now in a drowning flash: the persistent rejection of the 
play, 
his sudden resolve to put it on at his own cost, to spend ten 
thousand dollars of his inheritance on testing his chance of 
success&mdash;the fever of preparation, the dry-mouthed agony of the 
"first night," the flat fall, the stupid press, his secret rush 
to 
Europe to escape the condolence of his friends!</p><p> 
     <hi rend="italic">"It isn't as if you hadn't tried all kinds."</hi></p><p> 
     No&mdash;he had tried all kinds: comedy, tragedy, prose and 
verse, 
the light curtain-raiser, the short sharp drama, the bourgeois-realistic and the lyrical-romantic&mdash;finally deciding that he 
would 
no longer "prostitute his talent" to win popularity, but would 
impose on the public his own theory of art in the form of five 
acts 
of blank verse.  Yes, he had offered them everything&mdash;and always 
with the same result.</p><p> 
     Ten years of it&mdash;ten years of dogged work and unrelieved 
failure.  The ten years from forty to fifty&mdash;the best ten years 
of 
his life!  And if one counted the years before, the silent years 
of 
dreams, assimilation, preparation&mdash;then call it half a man's 
life-time: half a man's life-time thrown away!</p><p> 
     And what was he to do with the remaining half?  Well, he had 
settled that, thank God!  He turned and glanced anxiously at the 
clock.  Ten minutes past eight&mdash;only ten minutes had been 
consumed 
in that stormy rush through his whole past!  And he must wait 
another twenty minutes for Ascham.  It was one of the worst 
symptoms of his case that, in proportion as he had grown to 
shrink 
from human company, he dreaded more and more to be alone. . . .  
But why the devil was he waiting for Ascham?  Why didn't he cut 
the 
knot himself?  Since he was so unutterably sick of the whole 
business, why did he have to call in an outsider to rid him of 
this 
nightmare of living?</p><p> 
     He opened the drawer again and laid his hand on the 
revolver.  
It was a small slim ivory toy&mdash;just the instrument for a tired 
sufferer to give himself a "hypodermic" with.  Granice raised it 
slowly in one hand, while with the other he felt under the thin 
hair at the back of his head, between the ear and the nape.  He 
knew just where to place the muzzle: he had once got a young 
surgeon to show him.  And as he found the spot, and lifted the 
revolver to it, the inevitable phenomenon occurred.  The hand 
that 
held the weapon began to shake, the tremor communicated itself to 
<pb n="290"/>  his arm, his heart gave a wild leap which 
sent up a wave of 
deadly nausea to his throat, he smelt the powder, he sickened at 
the crash of the bullet through his skull, and a sweat of fear 
broke out over his forehead and ran down his quivering face. . 
.</p><p> 
     He laid away the revolver with an oath and, pulling out a 
cologne-scented handkerchief, passed it tremulously over his brow 
and temples.  It was no use&mdash;he knew he could never do it in that 
way.  His attempts at self-destruction were as futile as his 
snatches at fame!  He couldn't make himself a real life, and he 
couldn't get rid of the life he had.  And that was why he had 
sent 
for Ascham to help him. . .</p><p> 
     The lawyer, over the Camembert and Burgundy, began to excuse 
himself for his delay.</p><p> 
     "I didn't like to say anything while your man was about&mdash;but 
the fact is, I was sent for on a rather unusual matter&mdash;"</p><p> 
     "Oh, it's all right," said Granice cheerfully.  He was 
beginning to feel the usual reaction that food and company 
produced.  It was not any recovered pleasure in life that he 
felt, 
but only a deeper withdrawal into himself.  It was easier to go 
on 
automatically with the social gestures than to uncover to any 
human 
eye the abyss within him.</p><p> 
     "My dear fellow, it's sacrilege to keep a dinner waiting&mdash; 
especially the production of an artist like yours."  Mr. Ascham 
sipped his Burgundy luxuriously.  "But the fact is, Mrs. Ashgrove 
sent for me."</p><p> 
     Granice raised his head with a quick movement of surprise.  
For a moment he was shaken out of his self-absorption.</p><p> 
     <hi rend="italic">"Mrs. Ashgrove?"</hi></p><p> 
     Ascham smiled.  "I thought you'd be interested; I know your 
passion for <hi rend="italic">causes celebres</hi>.  And this promises to be one.  
Of 
course it's out of our line entirely&mdash;we never touch criminal 
cases.  But she wanted to consult me as a friend.  Ashgrove was a 
distant connection of my wife's.  And, by Jove, it <hi rend="italic">is</hi>a 
queer 
case!"  The servant re-entered, and Ascham snapped his lips 
shut.</p><p> 
     Would the gentlemen have their coffee in the 
dining-room?</p><p> 
     "No&mdash;serve it in the library," said Granice, rising.  He led 
the way back to the curtained confidential room.  He was really 
curious to hear what Ascham had to tell him.</p><p> 
     While the coffee and cigars were being served he fidgeted 
about the library, glancing at his letters&mdash;the usual meaningless 
notes and bills&mdash;and picking up the evening paper.  As he 
unfolded 
it a headline caught his eye. 
</p> 
           <p>"ROSE MELROSE WANTS TO</p> 
<p>                 PLAY POETRY.</p> 
<p>           "THINKS SHE HAS FOUND HER</p> 
<p>                    POET." 
</p><p> 
     He read on with a thumping heart&mdash;found the name of a young 
author he had barely heard of, saw the title of a play, a "poetic 
drama," dance before his eyes, and dropped the paper, sick, 
disgusted.  It was true, then&mdash;she <hi rend="italic">was"</hi>game"&mdash;it was not 
the 
manner but the matter she mistrusted!</p><p> 
     Granice turned to the servant, who seemed to be purposely 
lingering.  "I shan't need you this evening, Flint.  I'll lock up 
myself."</p><p> 
     He fancied the man's acquiescence implied surprise.  What 
was 
going on, Flint seemed to wonder, that Mr. Granice should want 
him 
out of the way?  Probably he would find a pretext for coming back 
to see.  Granice suddenly felt himself enveloped in a network of 
espionage.</p><p> 
     As the door closed he threw himself into an armchair and 
leaned forward to take a light from Ascham's cigar.</p><p> 
     "Tell me about Mrs. Ashgrove," he said, seeming to himself 
to 
speak stiffly, as if his lips were cracked.</p><p> 
     "Mrs. Ashgrove?  Well, there's not much to 
<hi rend="italic">tell</hi>."</p><p> 
     "And you couldn't if there were?"  Granice smiled.</p><p> 
     "Probably not.  As a matter of fact, she wanted my advice 
about her choice of counsel.  There was nothing especially 
confidential in our talk."</p><p> 
     "And what's your impression, now you've seen her?"</p><p> 
     "My impression is, very distinctly, <hi rend="italic">that nothing will 
ever 
be known."</hi></p><p> 
     "Ah&mdash;?" Granice murmured, puffing at his cigar.</p><p> 
     "I'm more and more convinced that whoever poisoned Ashgrove 
knew his business, and will consequently never be found out.  
That's a capital cigar you've given me."</p><p> 
     "You like it?  I get them over from <pb n="291"/>  
Cuba."  Granice 
examined his own reflectively.  "Then you believe in the theory 
that the clever criminals never <hi rend="italic">are</hi>caught?"</p><p> 
     "Of course I do.  Look about you&mdash;look back for the last 
dozen 
years&mdash;none of the big murder problems are ever solved."  The 
lawyer ruminated behind his blue cloud.  "Why, take the instance 
in 
your own family: I'd forgotten I had an illustration at hand!  
Take 
old Joseph Lenman's murder&mdash;do you suppose that will ever be 
explained?"</p><p> 
     As the words dropped from Ascham's lips his host looked 
slowly 
about the library, and every object in it stared back at him with 
a stale unescapable familiarity.  How sick he was of looking at 
that room!  It was as dull as the face of a wife one has wearied 
of.  He cleared his throat slowly; then he turned his head to the 
lawyer and said: "I could explain the Lenman murder 
myself."</p><p> 
     Ascham's eye kindled: he shared Granice's interest in 
criminal 
cases.</p><p> 
     "By Jove!  You've had a theory all this time?  It's odd you 
never mentioned it.  Go ahead and tell me.  There are certain 
features in the Lenman case not unlike this Ashgrove affair, and 
your idea may be a help."</p><p> 
     Granice paused and his eye reverted instinctively to the 
table 
drawer in which the revolver and the manuscript lay side by side. 
 
What if he were to try another appeal to Rose Melrose?  Then he 
looked at the notes and bills on the table, and the horror of 
taking up again the lifeless routine of life&mdash;of performing the 
same automatic gestures another day&mdash;displaced his fleeting 
vision.</p><p> 
     "I haven't a theory.  I <hi rend="italic">know</hi>who murdered Joseph 
Lenman."</p><p> 
     Ascham settled himself comfortably in his chair, prepared 
for 
enjoyment.</p><p> 
     "You <hi rend="italic">know?</hi> Well, who did?" he laughed.</p><p> 
     "I did," said Granice, rising.</p><p> 
     He stood before Ascham, and the lawyer lay back staring up 
at 
him.  Then he broke into another laugh.</p><p> 
     "Why, this is glorious!  You murdered him, did you?  To 
inherit his money, I suppose?  Better and better!  Go on, my boy! 
 
Unbosom yourself!  Tell me all about it!  Confession is good for 
the soul."</p><p> 
     Granice waited till the lawyer had shaken the last peal of 
laughter from his throat; then he repeated doggedly: "I murdered 
him."</p><p> 
     The two men looked at each other for a long moment, and this 
time Ascham did not laugh.</p><p> 
     "Granice!"</p><p> 
     "I murdered him&mdash;to get his money, as you say."</p><p> 
     There was another pause, and Granice, with a vague 
underlying 
sense of amusement, saw his guest's look change from pleasantry 
to 
apprehension.</p><p> 
     "What's the joke, my dear fellow?  I fail to see."</p><p> 
     "It's not a joke.  It's the truth.  I murdered him."  He had 
spoken painfully at first, as if there were a knot in his throat; 
but each time he repeated the words he found they were easier to 
say.</p><p> 
     Ascham laid down his extinct cigar.</p><p> 
     "What's the matter?  Aren't you well?  What on earth are you 
driving at?"</p><p> 
     "I'm perfectly well.  But I murdered my cousin, Joseph 
Lenman, 
and I want it known that I murdered him."</p><p> 
     <hi rend="italic">"You want it known?"</hi></p><p> 
     "Yes.  That's why I sent for you.  I'm sick of living, and 
when I try to kill myself I funk it."  He spoke quite naturally 
now, as if the knot in his throat had been untied.</p><p> 
     "Good Lord&mdash;good Lord," the lawyer gasped.</p><p> 
     "But I suppose," Granice continued, "there's no doubt this 
would be murder in the first degree?  I'm sure of the chair if I 
own up?"</p><p> 
     Ascham drew a long breath; then he said slowly: "Sit down, 
Granice.  Let's talk."</p>

<div1 type="section" n="2" id="d4"> 
<head>
                      II 
</head><p> 
     GRANICE told his story simply, connectedly.</p><p> 
     He began by a quick survey of his early years&mdash;the years of 
drudgery and privation.  His father, a charming man who could 
never 
say "no," had so signally failed to say it on certain essential 
occasions that when he died he left an illegitimate family and a 
mortgaged estate.  His lawful kin found themselves hanging over a 
gulf of debt, and young Granice, to support his mother and 
sister, 
had to leave Harvard and bury himself at eighteen in a broker's 
<pb n="292"/>  office.  He loathed his work, and he was 
always poor, always 
worried and in ill-health.  A few years later his mother died, 
but 
his sister, an ineffectual neurasthenic, remained on his hands.  
His own health gave out, and he had to go away for six months, 
and 
work harder than ever when he came back.  He had no knack for 
business, no head for figures, no dimmest insight into the 
mysteries of commerce.  He wanted to travel and write&mdash;those were 
his inmost longings.  And as the years dragged on, and he neared 
middle-age without making any more money, or acquiring any firmer 
health, a sick despair possessed him.  He tried writing, but he 
always came home from the office so tired that his brain could 
not 
work.  For half the year he did not reach his dim up-town flat 
till 
after dark, and could only "brush up" for dinner, and afterward 
lie 
on the lounge with his pipe, while his sister droned through the 
evening paper.  Sometimes he spent an evening at the theatre; or 
he 
dined out, or, more rarely, strayed off with an acquaintance or 
two 
in quest of what is known as "pleasure."  And in summer, when he 
and Kate went to the sea-side for a month, he dozed through the 
days in utter weariness.  Once he fell in love with a charming 
girl&mdash;but what had he to offer her, in God's name?  She seemed to 
like him, and in common decency he had to drop out of the 
running.  
Apparently no one replaced him, for she never married, but grew 
stoutish, grayish, philanthropic&mdash;yet how sweet she had been when 
he had first kissed her!  One more wasted life, he reflected. . 
.</p><p> 
     But the stage had always been his master-passion.  He would 
have sold his soul for the time and freedom to write plays!  It 
was 
<hi rend="italic">in him</hi>&mdash;he could not remember when it had not been his 
deepest-seated instinct.  As the years passed it became a morbid, a 
relentless obsession&mdash;yet with every year the material conditions 
were more and more against it.  He felt himself growing middle-aged, and he watched the reflection of the process in his 
sister's 
wasted face.  At eighteen she had been pretty, and as full of 
enthusiasm as he.  Now she was sour, trivial, insignificant&mdash;she 
had missed her chance of life.  And she had no resources, poor 
creature, was fashioned simply for the primitive functions she 
had 
been denied the chance to fulfil!  It exasperated him to think of 
it&mdash;and to reflect that even now a little travel, a little 
health, 
a little money, might transform her, make her young and 
desirable. 
. .  The chief fruit of his experience was that there is no such 
fixed state as age or youth&mdash;there is only health as against 
sickness, wealth as against poverty; and age or youth as the 
outcome of the lot one draws.</p><p> 
     At this point in his narrative Granice stood up, and went to 
lean against the mantel-piece, looking down at Ascham, who had 
not 
moved from his seat, or changed his attitude of rigid fascinated 
attention.</p><p> 
     "Then came the summer when we went to Wrenfield to be near 
old 
Lenman&mdash;my mother's cousin, as you know.  Some of the family 
always 
mounted guard over him&mdash;generally a niece or so.  But that year 
they were all scattered, and one of the nieces offered to lend us 
her cottage if we'd relieve her of duty for two months.  It was a 
nuisance for me, of course, for Wrenfield is two hours from town; 
but my mother, who was a slave to family observances, had always 
been good to the old man, so it was natural we should be called 
on&mdash;and there was the saving of rent and the good air for Kate.  
So 
we went.</p><p> 
     "You never knew Joseph Lenman?  Well, picture to yourself an 
amoeba or some primitive organism of that sort, under a Titan's 
microscope.  He was large, undifferentiated, inert&mdash;since I could 
remember him he had done nothing but take his temperature and 
read 
the <hi rend="italic">Churchman</hi>.  Oh, and cultivate melons&mdash;that was his 
hobby.  
Not vulgar, out-of-door melons&mdash;his were grown under glass.  He 
had 
miles of it at Wrenfield&mdash;his big kitchen-garden was surrounded 
by 
blinking battalions of green-houses.  And in nearly all of them 
melons were grown&mdash;early melons and late, French, English, 
domestic&mdash;dwarf melons and monsters: every shape, colour and 
variety.  They were petted and nursed like children&mdash;a staff of 
trained attendants waited on them.  I'm not sure they didn't have 
a doctor to take their temperature&mdash;at any rate the place was 
full 
of thermometers.  And they didn't sprawl on the ground like 
ordinary melons; they were trained against the glass like 
nectarines, and each melon hung in a net which sustained its 
weight 
and left it free on all sides to the sun and air. . . 
<pb n="293"/> </p><p> 
     "It used to strike me sometimes that old Lenman was just 
like 
one of his own melons&mdash;the pale-fleshed English kind.  His life, 
apathetic and motionless, hung in a net of gold, in an equable 
warm 
ventilated atmosphere, high above sordid earthly worries.  The 
cardinal rule of his existence was not to let himself be 
'worried.' 
. .  I remember his advising me to try it myself, one day when I 
spoke to him about Kate's bad health, and her need of a change.  
'I 
never let myself worry,' he said complacently.  'It's the worst 
thing for the liver&mdash;and you look to me as if you had a liver.  
Take my advice and be cheerful.  You'll make yourself happier and 
others too.'  And all he had to do was to write a cheque, and 
send 
the poor girl off for a holiday!</p><p> 
     "The hardest part of it was that the money half-belonged to 
us 
already.  The old skin-flint only had it for life, in trust for 
us 
and the others.  But his life was a good deal sounder than mine 
or 
Kate's&mdash;and one could picture him taking extra care of it for the 
joke of keeping us waiting.  I always felt that the sight of our 
hungry eyes was a tonic to him.</p><p> 
     "Well, I tried to see if I couldn't reach him through his 
vanity.  I flattered him, feigned a passionate interest in his 
melons.  And he was taken in, and used to discourse on them by 
the 
hour.  On fine days he was driven to the green-houses in his 
pony-chair, and waddled through them, prodding and leering at the 
fruit, 
like a fat Turk in his seraglio.  When he bragged to me of the 
expense of growing them I was reminded of a hideous old Lothario 
bragging of what his pleasures cost.  And the resemblance was 
completed by the fact that he couldn't eat as much as a mouthful 
of 
his melons&mdash;had lived for years on buttermilk and toast.  'But, 
after all, it's my only hobby&mdash;why shouldn't I indulge it?' he 
said 
sentimentally.  As if I'd ever been able to indulge any of mine!  
On the keep of those melons Kate and I could have lived like 
gods. 
. .</p><p> 
     "One day toward the end of the summer, when Kate was too 
unwell to drag herself up to the big house, she asked me to go 
and 
spend the afternoon with cousin Joseph.  It was a lovely soft 
September afternoon&mdash;a day to lie under a Roman stone-pine, with 
one's eyes on the sky, and let the cosmic harmonies rush through 
one.  Perhaps the vision was suggested by the fact that, as I 
entered cousin Joseph's hideous black walnut library, I passed 
one 
of the under-gardeners, a handsome full-throated Italian, who 
dashed out in such a hurry that he nearly knocked me down.  I 
remember thinking it queer that the fellow, whom I had often seen 
about the melon-houses, did not bow to me, or even seem to see 
me.</p><p> 
     "Cousin Joseph sat in his usual seat, behind the darkened 
windows, his fat hands folded on his protuberant waistcoat, the 
last number of the <hi rend="italic">Churchman</hi>at his elbow, and near it, on 
a 
huge dish, a fat melon&mdash;the fattest melon I'd ever seen.  As I 
looked at it I pictured the ecstasy of contemplation from which I 
must have roused him, and congratulated myself on finding him in 
such a mood, since I had made up my mind to ask him a favour.  
Then 
I noticed that his face, instead of looking as calm as an egg-shell, was distorted and whimpering&mdash;and without stopping to 
greet 
me he pointed passionately to the melon.</p><p> 
     "'Look at it, look at it&mdash;did you ever see such a beauty?  
Such firmness&mdash;roundness&mdash;such delicious smoothness to the 
touch?'  
It was as if he had said 'she' instead of 'it,' and when he put 
out 
his senile hand and touched the melon I positively had to look 
the 
other way.</p><p> 
     "Then he told me what had happened.  The Italian under-gardener, who had been specially recommended for the 
melon-houses&mdash; 
though it was against my cousin's principles to employ a Papist&mdash; 
had been assigned to the care of the monster: for it had revealed 
itself, early in its existence, as destined to become a monster, 
to 
surpass its plumpest, pulpiest sisters, carry off prizes at 
agricultural shows, and be photographed and celebrated in every 
gardening paper in the land.  The Italian had done well&mdash;seemed 
to 
have a sense of responsibility.  And that very morning he had 
been 
ordered to pick the melon, which was to be shown next day at the 
county fair, and to bring it in for Mr. Lenman to gaze on its 
blonde virginity.  But in picking it, what had the damned 
scoundrelly Jesuit done but drop it&mdash;drop it crash on the sharp 
spout of a watering-pot, so that it received a deep gash in its 
firm pale <pb n="294"/>  rotundity, and was henceforth but a 
bruised, 
ruined, fallen melon?</p><p> 
     "The old man's rage was fearful in its impotence&mdash;he shook, 
spluttered and strangled with it.  He had just had the Italian up 
and had sacked him on the spot, without wages or character&mdash;had 
threatened to have him arrested if he was ever caught prowling 
about Wrenfield.  'By God, and I'll do it&mdash;I'll write to 
Washington&mdash;I'll have the pauper scoundrel deported!  I'll show 
him 
what money can do!'  As likely as not there was some murderous 
Black-hand business under it&mdash;it would be found that the fellow 
was 
a member of a 'gang.'  Those Italians would murder you for a 
quarter.  He meant to have the police look into it. . .  And then 
he grew frightened at his own excitement.  'But I must calm 
myself,' he said.  He took his temperature, rang for his drops, 
and 
turned to the <hi rend="italic">Churchman</hi>.  He had been reading an article 
on 
Nestorianism when the melon was brought in.  He asked me to go on 
with it, and I read to him for an hour, in the dim close room, 
with 
a fat fly buzzing stealthily about the fallen melon.</p><p> 
     "All the while one phrase of the old man's buzzed in my 
brain 
like the fly about the melon.  '<hi rend="italic">I'll show him what money can 
do!</hi>' Good heaven!  If <hi rend="italic">I</hi> could but show the old man!  
If I 
could make him see his power of giving happiness as a new outlet 
for his monstrous egotism!  I tried to tell him something about 
my 
situation and Kate's&mdash;spoke of my ill-health, my unsuccessful 
drudgery, my longing to write, to make myself a name&mdash;I stammered 
out an entreaty for a loan.  'I can guarantee to repay you, sir&mdash; 
I've a half-written play as security. . .'</p><p> 
     "I shall never forget his glassy stare.  His face had grown 
as 
smooth as an egg-shell again&mdash;his eyes peered over his fat cheeks 
like sentinels over a slippery rampart.</p><p> 
     "'A half-written play&mdash;a play of <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>as security?'  
He 
looked at me almost fearfully, as if detecting the first symptoms 
of insanity.  'Do you understand anything of business?' he 
enquired 
mildly.  I laughed and answered: 'No, not much.'</p><p> 
     "He leaned back with closed lids.  'All this excitement has 
been too much for me,' he said.  'If you'll excuse me, I'll 
prepare 
for my nap.'  And I stumbled out of the room, blindly, like the 
Italian."</p><p> 
     Granice moved away from the mantel-piece, and walked across 
to 
the tray set out with decanters and soda-water.  He poured 
himself 
a tall glass of soda-water, emptied it, and glanced at Ascham's 
dead cigar.</p><p> 
     "Better light another," he suggested.</p><p> 
     The lawyer shook his head, and Granice went on with his 
tale.  
He told of his mounting obsession&mdash;how the murderous impulse had 
waked in him on the instant of his cousin's refusal, and he had 
muttered to himself: "By God, if you won't, I'll make you."  He 
spoke more tranquilly as the narrative proceeded, as though his 
rage had died down once the resolve to act on it was taken.  He 
applied his whole mind to the question of how the old man was to 
be 
"disposed of."  Suddenly he remembered the outcry: "Those 
Italians 
will murder you for a quarter!"  But no definite project 
presented 
itself: he simply waited for an inspiration.</p><p> 
     Granice and his sister moved to town a day or two after the 
incident of the melon.  But the cousins, who had returned, kept 
them informed of the old man's condition.  One day, about three 
weeks later, Granice, on getting home, found Kate excited over a 
report from Wrenfield.  The Italian had been there again&mdash;had 
somehow slipped into the house, made his way up to the library, 
and 
"used threatening language."  The house-keeper found cousin 
Joseph 
gasping, the whites of his eyes showing "something awful."  The 
doctor was sent for, and the attack warded off; and the police 
had 
ordered the Italian from the neighbourhood.</p><p> 
     But cousin Joseph, thereafter, languished, had "nerves," and 
lost his taste for toast and butter-milk.  The doctor called in a 
colleague, and the consultation amused and excited the old 
man&mdash;he 
became once more an important figure.  The medical men reassured 
the family&mdash;too completely!&mdash;and to the patient they recommended 
a 
more varied diet: advised him to take whatever "tempted him."  
And 
so one day, tremulously, prayerfully, he decided on a tiny bit of 
melon.  It was brought up with ceremony, and consumed in the 
presence of the house-keeper and a hovering cousin; and twenty 
minutes later he was dead. . .</p><p> 
     "But you remember the circumstances," <pb n="295"/>  
Granice went on; 
"how suspicion turned at once on the Italian?  In spite of the 
hint 
the police had given him he had been seen hanging about the house 
since 'the scene.'  It was said that he had tender relations with 
the kitchen-maid, and the rest seemed easy to explain.  But when 
they looked round to ask him for the explanation he was 
gone&mdash;gone 
clean out of sight.  He had been 'warned' to leave Wrenfield, and 
he had taken the warning so to heart that no one ever laid eyes 
on 
him again."</p><p> 
     Granice paused.  He had dropped into a chair opposite the 
lawyer's, and he sat for a moment, his head thrown back, looking 
about the familiar room.  Everything in it had grown grimacing 
and 
alien, and each strange insistent object seemed craning forward 
from its place to hear him.</p><p> 
     "It was I who put the stuff in the melon," he said.  "And I 
don't want you to think I'm sorry for it.  This isn't 'remorse,' 
understand.  I'm glad the old skin-flint is dead&mdash;I'm glad the 
others have their money.  But mine's no use to me any more.  My 
sister married miserably, and died.  And I've never had what I 
wanted."</p><p> 
     Ascham continued to stare; then he said: "What on earth was 
your object, then?"</p><p> 
     "Why, to <hi rend="italic">get</hi>what I wanted&mdash;what I fancied was in 
reach!  
I wanted change, rest, <hi rend="italic">life</hi>, for both of us&mdash;wanted, above 
all, 
for myself, the chance to write!  I travelled, got back my 
health, 
and came home to tie myself up to my work.  And I've slaved at it 
steadily for ten years without reward&mdash;without the most distant 
hope of success!  Nobody will look at my stuff.  And now I'm 
fifty, 
and I'm beaten, and I know it."  His chin dropped forward on his 
breast.  "I want to chuck the whole business," he ended.

<div1 type="section" n="3" id="d5">
<head> 
                      III 
</head><p> 
     IT was after midnight when Ascham left.</p><p> 
     His hand on Granice's shoulder, as he turned to 
go&mdash;"District 
Attorney be hanged; see a doctor, see a doctor!" he had cried; 
and 
so, with an exaggerated laugh, had pulled on his coat and 
departed.</p><p> 
     Granice turned back into the library.  It had never occurred 
to him that Ascham would not believe his story.  For three hours 
he 
had explained, elucidated, patiently and painfully gone over 
every 
detail&mdash;but without once breaking down the iron incredulity of 
the 
lawyer's eye.</p><p> 
     At first Ascham had feigned to be convinced&mdash;but that, as 
Granice now perceived, was simply to get him to expose himself, 
to 
entrap him into contradictions.  And when the attempt failed, 
when 
Granice triumphantly met and refuted each disconcerting question, 
the lawyer dropped the mask suddenly, and said with a 
good-humoured 
laugh: "By Jove, Granice you'll write a successful play yet.  The 
way you've worked this all out is a marvel."</p><p> 
     Granice swung about furiously&mdash;that last sneer about the 
play 
inflamed him.  Was all the world in a conspiracy to deride his 
failure?</p><p> 
     "I did it, I did it," he muttered sullenly, his rage 
spending 
itself against the impenetrable surface of the other's mockery; 
and 
Ascham answered with a smile: "Ever read any of those books on 
hallucination?  I've got a fairly good medico-legal library.  I 
could send you one or two if you like. . ." 
</p><p> 
     Left alone, Granice cowered down in the chair before his 
writing-table.  He understood that Ascham thought him off his 
head.</p><p> 
     "Good God&mdash;what if they all think me crazy?"</p><p> 
     The horror of it broke out over him in a cold sweat&mdash;he sat 
there and shook, his eyes hidden in his icy hands.  But 
gradually, 
as he began to rehearse his story for the thousandth time, he saw 
again how incontrovertible it was, and felt sure that any 
criminal 
lawyer would believe him.</p><p> 
     "That's the trouble&mdash;Ascham's not a criminal lawyer.  And 
then 
he's a friend.  What a fool I was to talk to a friend!  Even if 
he 
did believe me, he'd never let me see it&mdash;his instinct would be 
to 
cover the whole thing up. . .  But in that case&mdash;if he <hi rend="italic">did</hi> 
believe me&mdash;he might think it a kindness to get me shut up in an 
asylum. . ."  Granice began to tremble again.  "Good heaven!  If 
he 
should bring in an expert&mdash;one of those damned alienists!  Ascham 
and Pettilow can do anything&mdash;their word always goes.  If Ascham 
drops a hint that I'd better be shut up, I'll be in a 
strait-jacket 
by to-morrow!  And he'd do it from the kindest motives&mdash;be quite 
right to do it if he thinks I'm a murderer!" 
<pb n="296"/> 
</p><p> 
     The vision froze him to his chair.  He pressed his fists to 
his bursting temples and tried to think.  For the first time he 
hoped that Ascham had not believed his story.</p><p> 
     "But he did&mdash;he did!  I can see it now&mdash;I noticed what a 
queer 
eye he cocked at me.  Good God, what shall I do&mdash;what shall I 
do?"</p><p> 
     He started up and looked at the clock.  Half-past one.  What 
if Ascham should think the case urgent, rout out an alienist, and 
come back with him?  Granice jumped to his feet, and his sudden 
gesture brushed the morning paper from the table.  Mechanically 
he 
stooped to pick it up, and the movement started a new train of 
association.</p><p> 
     He sat down again, and reached for the telephone book in the 
rack by his chair.</p><p> 
     "Give me three-o-ten . . . yes."</p><p> 
     The new idea in his mind had revived his flagging energy.  
He 
would act&mdash;act at once.  It was only by thus planning ahead, 
committing himself to some unavoidable line of conduct, that he 
could pull himself through the meaningless days.  Each time he 
reached a fresh decision it was like coming out of a foggy 
weltering sea into a calm harbour with lights.  One of the 
queerest 
phases of his long agony was the intense relief produced by these 
momentary lulls.</p><p> 
     "That the office of the <hi rend="italic">Investigator?</hi> Yes?  Give me 
Mr. 
Denver, please. . .  Hallo, Denver. . .  Yes, Hubert Granice. . . 
.  Just caught you?  Going straight home?  Can I come and see you 
. . . yes, now . . . have a talk?  It's rather urgent . . . yes, 
might give you some first-rate 'copy.' . . .  All right!"  He 
hung 
up the receiver with a laugh.  It had been a happy thought to 
call 
up the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Investigator</hi>&mdash;Robert Denver was the 
very 
man he needed. . .</p><p> 
     Granice put out the lights in the library&mdash;it was odd how 
the 
automatic gestures persisted!&mdash;went into the hall, put on his hat 
and overcoat, and let himself out of the flat.  In the hall, a 
sleepy elevator boy blinked at him and then dropped his head on 
his 
folded arms.  Granice passed out into the street.  At the corner 
of 
Fifth Avenue he hailed a crawling cab, and called out an up-town 
address.  The long thoroughfare stretched before him, dim and 
deserted, like an ancient avenue of tombs.  But from Denver's 
house 
a friendly beam fell on the pavement; and as Granice sprang from 
his cab the editor's electric turned the corner.</p><p> 
     The two men grasped hands, and Denver, feeling for his 
latch-key, ushered Granice into the brightly-lit hall.</p><p> 
     "Disturb me?  Not a bit.  You might have, at ten to-morrow 
morning . . . but this is my liveliest hour . . . you know my 
habits of old."</p><p> 
     Granice had known Robert Denver for fifteen years&mdash;watched 
his 
rise through all the stages of journalism to the Olympian 
pinnacle 
of the <hi rend="italic">Investigator's</hi>editorial office.  In the thick-set 
man 
with grizzling hair there were few traces left of the hungry-eyed 
young reporter who, on his way home in the small hours, used to 
"bob in" on Granice, while the latter sat grinding at his plays.  
Denver had to pass Granice's flat on the way to his own, and it 
became a habit, if he saw a light in the window, and Granice's 
shadow against the blind, to go in, smoke a pipe, and discuss the 
universe.</p><p> 
     "Well&mdash;this is like old times&mdash;a good old habit reversed."  
The editor smote his visitor genially on the shoulder.  "Reminds 
me 
of the nights when I used to rout you out. . .  How's the play, 
by 
the way?  There <hi rend="italic">is</hi>a play, I suppose?  It's as safe to ask 
you 
that as to say to some men: 'How's the baby?'"</p><p> 
     Denver laughed good-naturedly, and Granice thought how thick 
and heavy he had grown.  It was evident, even to Granice's 
tortured 
nerves, that the words had not been uttered in malice&mdash;and the 
fact 
gave him a new measure of his insignificance.  Denver did not 
even 
know that he had been a failure!  The fact hurt more than 
Ascham's 
irony.</p><p> 
     "Come in&mdash;come in."  The editor led the way into a small 
cheerful room, where there were cigars and decanters.  He pushed 
an 
arm-chair toward his visitor, and dropped into another with a 
comfortable groan.</p><p> 
     "Now, then&mdash;help yourself.  And let's hear all about 
it."</p><p> 
     He beamed at Granice over his pipe-bowl, and the latter, 
lighting his cigar, said to himself: "Success makes men 
comfortable, but it makes them stupid."</p><p> 
     Then he turned, and began: "Denver, I want to tell you&mdash;" 
<pb n="297"/> </p><p> 
     The clock ticked rhythmically on the mantel-piece.  The 
little 
room was gradually filled with drifting blue layers of smoke, and 
through them the editor's face came and went like the moon 
through 
a moving sky.  Once the hour struck&mdash;then the rhythmical ticking 
began again.  The atmosphere grew denser and heavier, and beads 
of 
perspiration began to roll from Granice's forehead.</p><p> 
     "Do you mind if I open the window?"</p><p> 
     "No.  It <hi rend="italic">is</hi>stuffy in here.  Wait&mdash;I'll do it myself." 
 
Denver pushed down the upper sash, and returned to his chair.  
"Well&mdash;go on," he said, filling another pipe.  His composure 
exasperated Granice.</p><p> 
     "There's no use in my going on if you don't believe 
me."</p><p> 
     The editor remained unmoved.  "Who says I don't believe you? 
 
And how can I tell till you've finished?"</p><p> 
     Granice went on, ashamed of his outburst.  "It was simple 
enough, as you'll see.  From the day the old man said to me, 
'Those 
Italians would murder you for a quarter,' I dropped everything 
and 
just worked at my scheme.  It struck me at once that I must find 
a 
way of getting to Wrenfield and back in a night&mdash;and that led to 
the idea of a motor.  A motor&mdash;that never occurred to you?  You 
wonder where I got the money, I suppose.  Well, I had a thousand 
or 
so put by, and I nosed around till I found what I wanted&mdash;a 
second-hand racer.  I knew how to drive a car, and I tried the thing and 
found it was all right.  Times were bad, and I bought it for my 
price, and stored it away.  Where?  Why, in one of those no-questions-asked garages where they keep motors that are not for 
family use.  I had a lively cousin who had put me up to that 
dodge, 
and I looked about till I found a queer hole where they took in 
my 
car like a baby in a foundling asylum. . .  Then I practiced 
running to Wrenfield and back in a night.  I knew the way pretty 
well, for I'd done it often with the same lively cousin&mdash;and in 
the 
small hours, too.  The distance is over ninety miles, and on the 
third trial I did it under two hours.  But my arms were so lame 
that I could hardly get dressed the next morning. . .</p><p> 
     "Well, then came the report about the Italian's threats, and 
I saw I must act at once. . .  I meant to break into the old 
man's 
room, shoot him, and get away again.  It was a big risk, but I 
thought I could manage it.  Then we heard that he was ill&mdash;that 
there'd been a consultation.  Perhaps the fates were going to do 
it 
for me!  Good Lord, if that could only be! . . ."</p><p> 
     Granice stopped and wiped his forehead: the open window did 
not seem to have cooled the room.</p><p> 
     "Then came word that he was better; and the day after, when 
I 
came up from my office, I found Kate laughing over the news that 
he 
was to try a bit of melon.  The house-keeper had just telephoned 
her&mdash;all Wrenfield was in a flutter.  The doctor himself had 
picked 
out the melon, one of the little French ones that are hardly 
bigger 
than a large tomato&mdash;and the patient was to eat it at his 
breakfast 
the next morning.</p><p> 
     "In a flash I saw my chance.  It was a bare chance, no more. 
 
But I knew the ways of the house&mdash;I was sure the melon would be 
brought in over night and put in the pantry ice-box.  If there 
were 
only one melon in the ice-box I could be fairly sure it was the 
one 
I wanted.  Melons didn't lie around loose in that house&mdash;every 
one 
was known, numbered, catalogued.  The old man was beset by the 
dread that the servants would eat them, and he took a hundred 
mean 
precautions to prevent it.  Yes, I felt pretty sure of my melon . 
. . and poisoning was much safer than shooting.  It would have 
been 
the devil and all to get into the old man's bedroom without his 
rousing the house; but I ought to be able to break into the 
pantry 
without much trouble.</p><p> 
     "It was a cloudy night, too&mdash;everything served me.  I dined 
quietly, and sat down at my desk.  Kate had one of her usual 
headaches, and went to bed early.  As soon as she was gone I 
slipped out.  I had got together a sort of disguise&mdash;red beard 
and 
queer-looking ulster.  I shoved them into a bag, and went round 
to 
the garage.  There was no one there but a half-drunken machinist 
whom I'd never seen before.  That served me, too.  They were 
always 
changing machinists, and this new fellow didn't even bother to 
ask 
if the car belonged to me.  It was a very easy-going place. . 
.</p><p> 
     "Well, I jumped in, ran up Broadway, and let the car go as 
soon as I was out of <pb n="298"/>  Harlem.  Dark as it was, 
I could trust 
myself to strike a sharp pace.  In the shadow of a wood I stopped 
a second and got into the beard and ulster.  Then away again&mdash;it 
was just eleven-thirty when I got to Wrenfield.</p><p> 
     "I left the car in a dark lane behind the Lenman place, and 
slipped through the kitchen-garden.  The melon-houses winked at 
me 
through the dark&mdash;I remember thinking that they knew what I 
wanted 
to know. . . .  By the stable a dog came out growling&mdash;but he 
nosed 
me out, jumped on me, and went back. . .  The house was as dark 
as 
the grave.  I knew everybody went to bed by ten.  But there might 
be a prowling servant&mdash;the kitchen-maid might have come down to 
let 
in her Italian.  I had to risk that, of course.  I crept around 
by 
the back door and hid in the shrubbery.  Then I listened.  It was 
all as silent as death.  I crossed over to the house, pried open 
the pantry window and climbed in.  I had a little electric lamp 
in 
my pocket, and shielding it with my cap I groped my way to the 
ice-box, opened it&mdash;and there was the little French melon . . . only 
one.</p><p> 
     "I stopped to listen&mdash;I was quite cool.  Then I pulled out 
my 
bottle of stuff and my syringe, and gave each section of the 
melon 
a hypodermic.  It was all done inside of three minutes&mdash;at ten 
minutes to twelve I was back in the car.  I got out of the lane 
as 
quietly as I could, struck a back road that skirted the village, 
and let the car out as soon as I was beyond the last houses.  I 
only stopped once on the way in, to drop the beard and ulster 
into 
a pond.  I had a big stone ready to weight them with and they 
went 
down plump, like a dead body&mdash;and at two o'clock I was back at my 
desk."</p><p> 
     Granice stopped speaking and looked across the smoke-fumes 
at 
his listener; but Denver's face remained inscrutable.</p><p> 
     At length he said: "Why did you want to tell me 
this?"</p><p> 
     The question startled Granice.  He was about to explain, as 
he 
had explained to Ascham; but suddenly it occurred to him that if 
his motive had not seemed convincing to the lawyer it would carry 
much less weight with Denver.  Both were successful men, and 
success does not understand the subtle agony of failure.  Granice 
cast about for another reason.</p><p> 
     "Why, I&mdash;the thing haunts me . . . remorse, I suppose you'd 
call it. . ."</p><p> 
     Denver struck the ashes from his empty pipe.</p><p> 
     "Remorse?  Bosh!" he said energetically.</p><p> 
     Granice's heart sank.  "You don't believe 
in&mdash;<hi rend="italic">remorse?"</hi></p><p> 
     "Not an atom: in the man of action.  The mere fact of your 
talking of remorse proves to me that you're not the man to have 
planned and put through such a job."</p><p> 
     Granice groaned.  "Well&mdash;I lied to you about remorse.  I've 
never felt any."</p><p> 
     Denver's lips tightened sceptically about his freshly-filled 
pipe.  "What was your motive, then?  You must have had 
one."</p><p> 
     "I'll tell you&mdash;"  And Granice began again to rehearse the 
story of his failure, of his loathing for life.  "Don't say you 
don't believe me this time . . . that this isn't a real reason!" 
he 
stammered out piteously as he ended.</p><p> 
     Denver meditated.  "No, I won't say that.  I've seen too 
many 
queer things.  There's always a reason for wanting to get out of 
life&mdash;the wonder is that we find so many for staying in!"</p><p> 
     Granice's heart grew light.  "Then you <hi rend="italic">do</hi>believe me?" 
he 
faltered.</p><p> 
     "Believe that you're sick of the job?  Yes.  And that you 
haven't the nerve to pull the trigger?  Oh, yes&mdash;that's easy 
enough, too.  But all that doesn't make you a murderer&mdash;though I 
don't say it proves you could never have been one."</p><p> 
     "I <hi rend="italic">have</hi>been one, Denver&mdash;I swear to you."</p><p> 
     "Perhaps."  He meditated.  "Just tell me one or two 
things."</p><p> 
     "Oh, go ahead.  You won't stump me!" Granice heard himself 
say 
with a laugh.</p><p> 
     "Well&mdash;how did you make all those trial trips without 
exciting 
your sister's curiosity?  I knew your night habits pretty well at 
that time, remember.  You were very seldom out late.  Didn't the 
change in your ways surprise her?"</p><p> 
     "No; because she was away at the time.  She went to pay 
several visits in the country soon after we came back from 
Wrenfield, and was only in town for a night or two before&mdash;before 
I did the job."</p><p> 
     "And that night she went to bed early with a 
headache?"</p><p> 
     "Yes&mdash;blinding.  She didn't know any-<pb n="299"/>  
thing when she had that kind.  And her room was at the back of 
the flat."</p><p> 
     Denver again meditated.  "And when you got back&mdash;she didn't 
hear you?  You got in without her knowing it?"</p><p> 
     "Yes.  I went straight to my work&mdash;took it up at the word 
where I'd left off&mdash;<hi rend="italic">why, Denver, don't you remember?"</hi> 
Granice 
suddenly, passionately interjected.</p><p> 
     "Remember&mdash;?"</p><p> 
     "Yes; how you found me&mdash;when you looked in that morning, 
between two and three . . . your usual hour . . .?"</p><p> 
     "Yes," the editor nodded.</p><p> 
     Granice gave a short laugh.  "In my old coat&mdash;with my pipe: 
looked as if I'd been working all night, didn't I?  Well, I 
hadn't 
been in my chair ten minutes!"</p><p> 
     Denver uncrossed his legs and then crossed them again.  "I 
didn't know whether <hi rend="italic">you</hi>remembered that."</p><p> 
     "What?"</p><p> 
     "My coming in that particular night&mdash;or morning."</p><p> 
     Granice swung round in his chair.  "Why, man alive!  That's 
why I'm here now.  Because it was you who spoke for me at the 
inquest, when they looked round to see what all the old man's 
heirs 
had been doing that night&mdash;you who testified to having dropped in 
and found me at my desk as usual. . . .  I thought 
<hi rend="italic">that</hi>would 
appeal to your journalistic sense if nothing else would!"</p><p> 
     Denver smiled.  "Oh, my journalistic sense is still 
susceptible enough&mdash;and the idea's picturesque, I grant you: 
asking 
the man who proved your alibi to establish your guilt."</p><p> 
     "That's it&mdash;that's it!"  Granice's laugh had a ring of 
triumph.</p><p> 
     "Well, but how about the other chap's testimony&mdash;I mean that 
young doctor: what was his name?  Ned Ranney.  Don't you remember 
my testifying that I'd met him at the elevated station, and told 
him I was on my way to smoke a pipe with you, and his saying: 
'All 
right; you'll find him in.  I passed the house two hours ago, and 
saw his shadow against the blind, as usual.'  And the lady with 
the 
toothache in the flat across the way: she corroborated his 
statement, you remember."</p><p> 
     "Yes; I remember."</p><p> 
     Well, then?"</p><p> 
     "Simple enough.  Before starting I rigged up a kind of 
mannikin with old coats and a cushion&mdash;something to cast a shadow 
on the blind.  All you fellows were used to seeing my shadow 
there 
in the small hours&mdash;I counted on that, and knew you'd take any 
vague outline as mine."</p><p> 
     "Simple enough, as you say.  But the woman with the 
toothache 
saw the shadow move&mdash;you remember she said she saw you sink 
forward, as if you'd fallen asleep."</p><p> 
     "Yes; and she was right.  It <hi rend="italic">did</hi>move.  I suppose some 
extra-heavy dray must have jolted by the flimsy building&mdash;at any 
rate, something gave my mannikin a jar, and when I came back he 
had 
sunk forward, half over the table."</p><p> 
     There was a long silence between the two men.  Granice, with 
a throbbing heart, watched Denver refill his pipe.  The editor, 
at 
any rate, did not sneer and flout him.  After all, journalism 
gave 
a deeper insight than the law into the fantastic possibilities of 
life, prepared one better to allow for the incalculableness of 
human impulses.</p><p> 
     "Well?" Granice faltered out.</p><p> 
     Denver stood up with a shrug.  "Look here, man&mdash;what's wrong 
with you?  Make a clean breast of it!  Nerves gone to smash?  I'd 
like to take you to see a chap I know&mdash;an ex-prize-fighter&mdash;who's 
a wonder at pulling fellows in your state out of their 
hole&mdash;"</p><p> 
     "Oh, oh&mdash;" Granice broke in.  He stood up also, and the two 
men eyed each other.  "You don't believe me, then?"</p><p> 
     "This yarn&mdash;how can I?  There wasn't a flaw in your 
alibi."</p><p> 
     "But haven't I filled it full of them now?"</p><p> 
     Denver shook his head.  "I might think so if I hadn't 
happened 
to know that you <hi rend="italic">wanted</hi>to.  There's the hitch, don't you 
see?"</p><p> 
     Granice groaned.  "No, I didn't.  You mean my wanting to be 
found guilty&mdash;?"</p><p> 
     "Of course!  If somebody else had accused you, the story 
might 
have been worth looking into.  As it is, a child could have 
invented it.  It doesn't do much credit to your 
ingenuity."</p><p> 
     Granice turned sullenly toward the door.  What was the use 
of 
arguing?  But on the threshold a sudden impulse drew him back.  
"Look here, Denver&mdash;I daresay you're right.  But will you do just 
one thing to prove it?  Put my statement in the 
<hi rend="italic">Investigator</hi>, 
just as I've made it.  Ridicule it as much as you like.  Only 
give 
the other <pb n="300"/>  fellows a chance at it&mdash;men who 
don't know 
anything about me.  Set them talking and looking about.  I don't 
care a damn whether <hi rend="italic">you</hi>believe me&mdash;what I want is to 
convince 
the Grand Jury!  I oughtn't to have come to a man who knows me&mdash; 
your cursed incredulity is infectious.  I don't put my case well, 
because I know in advance it's discredited, and I almost end by 
not 
believing it myself.  That's why I can't convince <hi rend="italic">you</hi>.  
It's a 
vicious circle."  He laid a hand on Denver's arm.  "Send a 
stenographer, and put my statement in the paper.</p><p> 
     But Denver did not warm to the idea.  "My dear fellow, you 
seem to forget that all the evidence was pretty thoroughly sifted 
at the time, every possible clue followed up.  The public would 
have been ready enough then to believe that you murdered old 
Lenman&mdash;you or anybody else.  All they wanted was a murderer&mdash;the 
most improbable would have served.  But your alibi was too 
confoundedly complete.  And nothing you've told me has shaken 
it."  
Denver laid his cool hand over the other's burning fingers.  
"Look 
here, old fellow, go home and work up a better case&mdash;then come in 
and submit it to the <hi rend="italic">Investigator</hi>."

                      IV 
</head><p> 
     THE perspiration was rolling off Granice's forehead.  Every 
few minutes he had to draw out his handkerchief and wipe the 
moisture from his haggard face.</p><p> 
     For an hour and a half he had been talking steadily, putting 
his case to the District Attorney.  Luckily he had a speaking 
acquaintance with Allonby, and had obtained, without much 
difficulty, a private audience on the very day after his talk 
with 
Robert Denver.  In the interval between he had hurried home, got 
out of his evening clothes, and gone forth again at once into the 
dreary dawn.  His fear of Ascham and the alienist made it 
impossible for him to remain in his rooms.  And it seemed to him 
that the only way of averting that hideous peril was by 
establishing, in some sane impartial mind, the proof of his 
guilt.  
Even if he had not been so incurably sick of life, the electric 
chair seemed now the only alternative to the 
strait-jacket.</p><p> 
     As he paused to wipe his forehead he saw the District 
Attorney 
glance at his watch.  The gesture was significant, and Granice 
lifted an appealing hand.  "I don't expect you to believe me 
now&mdash; 
but can't you put me under arrest, and have the thing looked 
into?"</p><p> 
     Allonby smiled faintly under his heavy grayish moustache.  
He 
had a ruddy face, full and jovial, in which his keen professional 
eyes seemed to keep watch over impulses not strictly 
professional.</p><p> 
     "Well, I don't know that we need lock you up just yet.  But 
of 
course I'm bound to look into your statement&mdash;"</p><p> 
     Granice rose with an exquisite sense of relief.  Surely 
Allonby wouldn't have said that if he hadn't believed him!</p><p> 
     "That's all right.  Then I needn't detain you.  I can be 
found 
at any time at my apartment."  He gave the address.</p><p> 
     The District Attorney smiled again, more openly.  "What do 
you 
say to leaving it for an hour or two this evening?  I'm giving a 
little supper at Rector's&mdash;quiet, little affair, you understand: 
just Miss Melrose&mdash;I think you know her&mdash;and a friend or two; and 
if you'll join us. . ."</p><p> 
     Granice stumbled out of the office without knowing what 
reply 
he had made. 
</p><p> 
     He waited for four days&mdash;four days of concentrated horror.  
During the first twenty-four hours the fear of Ascham's alienist 
dogged him; and as that subsided, it was replaced by the 
exasperating sense that his avowal had made no impression on the 
District Attorney.  Evidently, if he had been going to look into 
the case, Allonby would have been heard from before now. . . .  
And 
that mocking invitation to supper showed clearly enough how 
little 
the story had impressed him!</p><p> 
     Granice was overcome by the futility of any farther attempt 
to 
inculpate himself.  He was chained to life&mdash;a "prisoner of 
consciousness."  Where was it he had read the phrase?  Well, he 
was 
learning what it meant.  In the glaring night-hours, when his 
brain 
seemed ablaze, he was visited by a sense of his fixed identity, 
of 
his irreducible, inexpugnable <hi rend="italic">selfness</hi>, keener, more 
insidious, 
more unescapable, than any sensation he had ever known.  He had 
not 
guessed that the mind was capable of such intricacies of self-realization, of penetrating so deep into its own dark wind- <pb n="301"/> ings.  Often he woke from his brief snatches 
of sleep with the 
feeling that something material was clinging to him, was on his 
hands and face, and in his throat&mdash;and as his brain cleared he 
understood that it was the sense of his own loathed personality 
that stuck to him like some thick viscous substance.</p><p> 
     Then, in the first morning hours, he would rise and look out 
of his window at the awakening activities of the street&mdash;at the 
street-cleaners, the ash-cart drivers, and the other dingy 
workers 
flitting hurriedly by through the sallow winter light.  Oh, to be 
one of them&mdash;any of them&mdash;to take his chance in any of their 
skins!  
They were the toilers&mdash;the men whose lot was pitied&mdash;the victims 
wept over and ranted about by altruists and economists; and how 
gladly he would have taken up the load of any one of them, if 
only 
he might have shaken off his own!  But, no&mdash;the iron circle of 
consciousness held them too: each one was hand-cuffed to his own 
hideous ego.  Why wish to be any one man rather than another?  
The 
only absolute good was not to be . . .  And Flint, coming in to 
draw his bath, would ask if he preferred his eggs scrambled or 
poached that morning? 
</p><p> 
     On the fifth day he wrote a long urgent letter to Allonby; 
and 
for the succeeding two days he had the occupation of waiting for 
an 
answer.  He hardly stirred from his rooms, in his fear of missing 
the letter by a moment; but would the District Attorney write, or 
send a representative: a policeman, a "secret agent," or some 
other 
mysterious emissary of the law?</p><p> 
     On the third morning Flint, stepping softly&mdash;as if, confound 
it! his master were ill&mdash;entered the library where Granice sat 
behind an unread newspaper, and proferred a card on a 
tray.</p><p> 
     Granice read the name&mdash;J. B. Hewson&mdash;and underneath, in 
pencil, "From the District Attorney's office."  He started up 
with 
a thumping heart, and signed an assent to the servant.</p><p> 
     Mr. Hewson was a slight sallow nondescript man of about 
fifty&mdash;the kind of man of whom one is sure to see a specimen in 
any 
crowd.  "Just the type of the successful detective," Granice 
reflected as he shook hands with his visitor.</p><p> 
     And it was in that character that Mr. Hewson briefly 
introduced himself.  He had been sent by the District Attorney to 
have "a quiet talk" with Mr. Granice&mdash;to ask him to repeat the 
statement he had made about the Lenman murder.</p><p> 
     His manner was so quiet, so reasonable and receptive, that 
Granice's self-confidence returned.  Here was a sensible man&mdash;a 
man 
who knew his business&mdash;it would be easy enough to make 
<hi rend="italic">him</hi>see 
through that ridiculous alibi!  Granice offered Mr. Hewson a 
cigar, 
and lighting one himself&mdash;to prove his coolness&mdash;began again to 
tell his story.</p><p> 
     He was conscious, as he proceeded, of telling it better than 
ever before.  Practice helped, no doubt; and his listener's 
detached, impartial attitude helped still more.  He could see 
that 
Hewson, at least, had not decided in advance to disbelieve him, 
and 
the sense of being trusted made him more lucid and more 
consecutive.  Yes, this time his words would certainly carry 
conviction. . . 
</p> 
</div1> 
<div1 type="section" n="5" id="d7">
<head> 
                       V 
</head><p> 
     DESPAIRINGLY, Granice gazed up and down the shabby street.  
Beside him stood a young man with bright prominent eyes, a smooth 
but not too smoothly-shaven face, and an Irish smile.  The young 
man's nimble glance followed Granice's.</p><p> 
     "Sure of the number, are you?" he asked briskly.</p><p> 
     "Oh, yes&mdash;it was 104."</p><p> 
     "Well, then, the new building has swallowed it up&mdash;that's 
certain."</p><p> 
     He tilted his head back and surveyed the half-finished front 
of a brick and limestone flat-house that reared its flimsy 
elegance 
above a row of tottering tenements and stables.</p><p> 
     "Dead sure?" he repeated.</p><p> 
     "Yes," said Granice, discouraged.  "And even if I hadn't 
been, 
I know the garage was just opposite Leffler's over there."  He 
pointed across the street to a tumble-down stable with a blotched 
sign on which the words "Livery and Boarding" were still faintly 
discernible.</p><p> 
     The young man dashed across to the opposite pavement.  
"Well, 
that's something&mdash;may get a clue there.  Leffler's&mdash;same name 
there, anyhow.  You remember that name?" 
<pb n="302"/>   
</p><p> 
     "Yes&mdash;distinctly."</p><p> 
     Granice had felt a return of confidence since he had 
enlisted 
the interest of the <hi rend="italic">Explorer's"</hi>smartest" reporter.  If 
there 
were moments when he hardly believed his own story, there were 
others when it seemed impossible that every one should not 
believe 
it; and young Peter McCarren, peering, listening, questioning, 
jotting down notes, inspired him with an exquisite sense of 
security.  McCarren had fastened on the case at once, "like a 
leech," as he phrased it&mdash;jumped at it, thrilled to it, and 
settled 
down to "draw the last drop of fact from it, and had not let go 
till he had."  No one else had treated Granice in that way&mdash;even 
Allonby's detective had not taken a single note.  And though a 
week 
had elapsed since the visit of that authorized official, nothing 
had been heard from the District Attorney's office: Allonby had 
apparently dropped the matter again.  But McCarren wasn't going 
to 
drop it&mdash;not he!  He positively hung on Granice's footsteps.  
They 
had spent the greater part of the previous day together, and now 
they were off again, running down clues.</p><p> 
     But at Leffler's they got none, after all.  Leffler's was no 
longer a stable.  It was condemned to demolition, and in the 
respite between sentence and execution it had become a vague 
place 
of storage, a hospital for broken-down carriages and carts, 
presided over by a blear-eyed old woman who knew nothing of 
Flood's 
garage across the way&mdash;did not even remember what had stood there 
before the new flat-house began to rise.</p><p> 
     "Well&mdash;we may run Leffler down somewhere; I've seen harder 
jobs done," said McCarren, cheerfully noting down the 
name.</p><p> 
     As they walked back toward Sixth Avenue he added, in a less 
sanguine tone: "I'd undertake now to put the thing through if you 
could only put me on the track of that cyanide."</p><p> 
     Granice's heart sank.  Yes&mdash;there was the weak spot; he had 
felt it from the first!  But he still hoped to convince McCarren 
that his case was strong enough without it; and he urged the 
reporter to come back to his rooms and sum up the facts with him 
again.</p><p> 
     "Sorry, Mr. Granice, but I'm due at the office now.  
Besides, 
it'd be no use till I get some fresh stuff to work on.  Suppose I 
call you up tomorrow or next day?"</p><p> 
     He plunged into a trolley and left Granice gazing desolately 
after him.</p><p> 
     Two days later he reappeared at the apartment, a shade less 
jaunty in demeanor.</p><p> 
     "Well, Mr. Granice, the stars in their courses are against 
you, as the bard says.  Can't get a trace of Flood, or of Leffler 
either.  And you say you bought the motor through Flood, and sold 
it through him, too?"</p><p> 
     "Yes," said Granice wearily.</p><p> 
     "Who bought it, do you know?"</p><p> 
     Granice wrinkled his brows.  "Why, Flood&mdash;yes, Flood 
himself.  
I sold it back to him three months later."</p><p> 
     "Flood?  The devil!  And I've ransacked the town for Flood.  
That kind of business disappears as if the earth had swallowed 
it."</p><p> 
     Granice, discouraged, kept silence.</p><p> 
     "That brings us back to the poison," McCarren continued, his 
note-book out.  "Just go over that again, will you?"</p><p> 
     And Granice went over it again.  It had all been so simple 
at 
the time&mdash;and he had been so clever in covering up his traces!  
As 
soon as he decided on poison he looked about for an acquaintance 
who manufactured chemicals; and there was Jim Dawes, a Harvard 
classmate, in the dyeing business&mdash;just the man.  But at the last 
moment it occurred to him that suspicion might turn toward so 
obvious an opportunity, and he decided on a more tortuous course. 
 
Another friend, Carrick Venn, a student of medicine whom 
irremediable ill-health had kept from the practice of his 
profession, amused his leisure with experiments in physics, for 
the 
exercise of which he had set up a simple laboratory.  Granice had 
the habit of dropping in to smoke a cigar with him on Sunday 
afternoons, and the friends generally sat in Venn's work-shop, at 
the back of the old family house in Stuyvesant Square.  Off this 
work-shop was the cupboard of supplies, with its row of deadly 
bottles.  Carrick Venn was an original, a man of restless curious 
tastes, and his place, on a Sunday, was often full of visitors: a 
cheerful crowd of journalists, scribblers, painters, 
experimenters 
in divers forms of expression.  Coming and going among so many, 
it 
was easy enough to pass <pb n="303"/>  unperceived; and one 
afternoon 
Granice, arriving before Venn had returned home, found himself 
alone in the work-shop, and quickly slipping into the cupboard, 
transferred the drug to his pocket.</p><p> 
     But that had happened ten years ago; and Venn, poor fellow, 
was long since dead of his dragging ailment.  His old father was 
dead, too, the house in Stuyvesant Square had been turned into a 
boarding-house, and the shifting life of New York had passed its 
rapid sponge over every trace of their obscure little history.  
Even the optimistic McCarren seemed to acknowledge the 
hopelessness 
of seeking for proof in that direction.</p><p> 
     "And there's the third door slammed in our faces."  He shut 
his note-book, and throwing back his head, rested his bright 
inquisitive eyes on Granice's furrowed face.</p><p> 
     "Look here, Mr. Granice&mdash;you see the weak spot, don't 
you?"</p><p> 
     The other made a despairing motion.  "I see so many!"</p><p> 
     "Yes: but the one that weakens all the others.  Why the 
deuce 
do you want this thing known?  Why do you want to put your head 
into the noose?"</p><p> 
     Granice looked at him hopelessly, trying to take the measure 
of his quick light irreverent mind.  No one so full of a cheerful 
animal life would believe in the craving for death as a 
sufficient 
motive; and Granice racked his brain for one more convincing.  
But 
suddenly he saw the reporter's face soften, and melt to a naive 
sentimentalism.</p><p> 
     "Mr. Granice&mdash;has the memory of it always haunted 
you?"</p><p> 
     Granice stared a moment, and then leapt at the opening.  
"That's it&mdash;the memory of it . . . always . . ."</p><p> 
     McCarren nodded vehemently.  "Dogged your steps, eh?  
Wouldn't 
let you sleep?  The time came when you <hi rend="italic">had</hi>to make a clean 
breast of it?"</p><p> 
     "I had to.  Can't you understand?"</p><p> 
     The reporter struck his fist on the table.  "God, sir!  I 
don't suppose there's a human being with a drop of warm blood in 
him that can't picture the deadly horrors of remorse&mdash;"</p><p> 
     The Celtic imagination was aflame, and Granice mutely 
thanked 
him for the word.  What neither Ascham nor Denver would accept as 
a conceivable motive the Irish reporter seized on as the most 
adequate; and, as he said, once one could find a convincing 
motive, 
the difficulties of the case became so many incentives to 
effort.</p><p> 
     "Remorse&mdash;<hi rend="italic">remorse</hi>," he repeated, rolling the word 
under 
his tongue with an accent that was a clue to the psychology of 
the 
popular drama; and Granice, perversely, said to himself: "If I 
could only have struck that note I should have been running in 
six 
theatres at once."</p><p> 
     He saw that from that moment McCarren's professional zeal 
would be fanned by emotional curiosity; and he profited by the 
fact 
to propose that they should dine together, and go on afterward to 
some music-hall or theatre.  It was becoming necessary to Granice 
to feel himself an object of pre-occupation, to find himself in 
another mind.  He took a kind of gray penumbral pleasure in 
riveting McCarren's attention on his case; and to feign the 
grimaces of moral anguish became a passionately engrossing game.  
He had not entered a theatre for months; but he sat out the 
meaningless performance in rigid tolerance, sustained by the 
sense 
of the reporter's observation.</p><p> 
     Between the acts, McCarren amused him with anecdotes about 
the 
audience: he knew every one by sight, and could lift the curtain 
from every physiognomy.  Granice listened indulgently.  He had 
lost 
all interest in his kind, but he knew that he was himself the 
real 
centre of McCarren's attention, and that every word the latter 
spoke had an indirect bearing on his own problem.</p><p> 
     "See that fellow over there&mdash;the little dried-up man in the 
third row, pulling his moustache?  <hi rend="italic">His</hi>memoirs would be 
worth 
publishing," McCarren said suddenly in the last 
<hi rend="italic">entr'acte</hi>.</p><p> 
     Granice, following his glance, recognized the detective from 
Allonby's office.  For a moment he had the thrilling sense that 
he 
was being shadowed.</p><p> 
     "Caesar, if <hi rend="italic">he</hi>could talk&mdash;!" McCarren continued.  
"Know 
who he is, of course?  Dr. John B. Stell, the biggest alienist in 
the country&mdash;"</p><p> 
     Granice, with a start, bent again between the heads in front 
of him.  <hi rend="italic">"That</hi>man&mdash;the fourth from the aisle?  You're 
mistaken.  That's not Dr. Stell."</p><p> 
     McCarren laughed.  "Well, I guess I've <pb n="304"/>  
been in court 
enough to know Stell when I see him.  He testifies in nearly all 
the big cases where they plead insanity."</p><p> 
     A cold shiver ran down Granice's spine, but he repeated 
obstinately: "That's not Dr. Stell."</p><p> 
     "Not Stell?  Why, man, I <hi rend="italic">know</hi>him.  Look&mdash;here he 
comes.  
If it isn't Stell, he won't speak to me."</p><p> 
     The little dried-up man was moving slowly up the aisle.  As 
he 
neared McCarren he made a slight gesture of recognition.</p><p> 
     "How'do, Doctor Stell?  Pretty slim show, ain't it?" the 
reporter cheerfully flung out at him.  And Mr. J. B. Hewson, with 
a nod of amicable assent, passed on.</p><p> 
     Granice sat benumbed.  He knew he had not been mistaken&mdash;the 
man who had just passed was the same man whom Allonby had sent to 
see him: a physician disguised as a detective.  Allonby, then, 
had 
thought him insane, like the others&mdash;had regarded his confession 
as 
the maundering of a maniac.  The discovery froze Granice with 
horror&mdash;he seemed to see the mad-house gaping for him.</p><p> 
     "Isn't there a man a good deal like him&mdash;a detective named 
J. 
B. Hewson?"</p><p> 
     But he knew in advance what McCarren's answer would be.  
"Hewson?  J. B. Hewson?  Never heard of him.  But that was J. B. 
Stell fast enough&mdash;I guess he can be trusted to know himself, and 
you saw he answered to his name."

<div1 type="section" n="6" id="d8"><head> 
                      VI 
</head><p> 
     SOME days passed before Granice could obtain a word with the 
District Attorney: he began to think that Allonby avoided 
him.</p><p> 
     But when they were face to face Allonby's jovial countenance 
showed no sign of embarrassment.  He waved his visitor to a 
chair, 
and leaned across his desk with the encouraging smile of a 
consulting physician.</p><p> 
     Granice broke out at once: "That detective you sent me the 
other day&mdash;"</p><p> 
     Allonby raised a deprecating hand.</p><p> 
     "&mdash;I know: it was Stell the alienist.  Why did you do that, 
Allonby?"</p><p> 
     The other's face did not lose its composure.  "Because I 
looked up your story first&mdash;and there's nothing in it."</p><p> 
     "Nothing in it?" Granice furiously interposed.</p><p> 
     "Absolutely nothing.  If there is, why the deuce don't you 
bring me proofs?  I know you've been talking to Peter Ascham, and 
to Denver, and to that little ferret McCarren of the 
<hi rend="italic">Explorer</hi>.  
Have any of them been able to make out a case for you?  No.  
Well, 
what am I to do?"</p><p> 
     Granice's lips began to tremble.  "Why did you play me that 
trick?"</p><p> 
     "About Stell?  I had to, my dear fellow: it's part of my 
business.  Stell <hi rend="italic">is</hi>a detective, if you come to that&mdash;every 
doctor is."</p><p> 
     The trembling of Granice's lips increased, communicating 
itself in a long quiver to his facial muscles.  He forced a laugh 
through his dry throat.  "Well&mdash;and what did he detect?"</p><p> 
     "In you?  Oh, he thinks it's overwork&mdash;overwork and too much 
smoking.  If you look in on him some day at his office he'll show 
you the record of hundreds of cases like yours, and advise you 
what 
treatment to follow.  It's one of the commonest forms of 
hallucination.  Have a cigar, all the same."</p><p> 
     "But, Allonby, I killed that man!"</p><p> 
     The District Attorney's large hand, outstretched on his 
desk, 
had an almost imperceptible gesture, and a moment later, as if an 
answer to the call of an electric bell, a clerk looked in from 
the 
outer office.</p><p> 
     "Sorry, my dear fellow&mdash;lot of people waiting.  Drop in on 
Stell some morning," Allonby said, shaking hands. 
</p><p> 
     McCarren had to own himself beaten: there was absolutely no 
flaw in the alibi.  And since his duty to his journal obviously 
forbade his wasting time on insoluble mysteries, he ceased to 
frequent Granice, who dropped back into a deeper isolation.  For 
a 
day or two after his visit to Allonby he continued to live in 
dread 
of Dr. Stell.  Why might not Allonby have deceived him as to the 
alienist's diagnosis?  What if he were really being shadowed, not 
by a police agent but by a mad-doctor?  To have the truth out, he 
suddenly determined to call on Dr. Stell.</p><p> 
     The physician received him kindly, and reverted without 
embarrassment to the conditions of their previous meeting.  "We 
have to do that occasionally, Mr. Granice; it's one of our 
methods.  
And you had given Allonby a fright."</p><p> 
     Granice was silent.  He would have <pb n="305"/>  liked 
to reaffirm 
his guilt, to produce the fresh arguments which had occurred to 
him 
since his last talk with the physician; but he feared his 
eagerness 
might be taken for a symptom of derangement, and he affected to 
smile away Dr. Stell's allusion.</p><p> 
     "You think, then, it's a case of brain-fag&mdash;nothing 
more?"</p><p> 
     "Nothing more.  And I should advise you to knock off 
tobacco.  
You smoke a good deal, don't you?"</p><p> 
     He developed his treatment, recommending massage, 
gymnastics, 
travel, or any form of diversion that did not&mdash;that in 
short&mdash;</p><p> 
     Granice interrupted him impatiently.  "Oh, I loathe all 
that&mdash; 
and I'm sick of travelling."</p><p> 
     "H'm.  Then some larger interest&mdash;politics, reform, 
philanthropy?  Something to take you out of yourself."</p><p> 
     "Yes.  I understand," said Granice wearily.</p><p> 
     "Above all, don't lose heart.  I see hundreds of cases like 
yours," the doctor added cheerfully from the threshold.</p><p> 
     On the doorstep Granice stood still and laughed.  Hundreds 
of 
cases like his&mdash;the case of a man who had committed a murder, who 
confessed his guilt, and whom no one would believe!  Why, there 
had 
never been a case like it in the world.  What a good figure Stell 
would have made in a play: the great alienist who couldn't read a 
man's mind any better than that!</p><p> 
     Granice saw huge comic opportunities in the type.</p><p> 
     But as he walked away, his fears dispelled, the sense of 
listlessness returned on him.  For the first time since his 
avowal 
to Peter Ascham he found himself without an occupation, and 
understood that he had been carried through the past weeks only 
by 
the necessity of constant action.  Now his life had once more 
become a stagnant backwater, and as he stood on the street corner 
watching the tides of traffic sweep by, he asked himself 
despairingly how much longer he could endure to float about in 
the 
sluggish circle of his consciousness.</p><p> 
     The thought of self-destruction recurred to him; but again 
his 
flesh recoiled.  He yearned for death from other hands, but he 
could never take it from his own.  And, aside from his 
insuperable 
physical reluctance, another motive restrained him.  He was 
possessed by the dogged desire to establish the truth of his 
story.  
He refused to be swept aside as an irresponsible dreamer&mdash;even if 
he had to kill himself in the end, he would not do so before 
proving to society that he had deserved death from it.</p><p> 
     He began to write long letters to the papers; but after the 
first had been published and commented on, public curiosity was 
quelled by a brief statement from the District Attorney's office, 
and the rest of his communications remained unprinted.  Ascham 
came 
to see him, and begged him to travel.  Robert Denver dropped in, 
and tried to joke him out of his delusion; till Granice, 
mistrustful of their motives, began to dread the reappearance of 
Dr. Stell, and set a guard on his lips.  But the words he kept 
back 
engendered others and still others in his brain.  His inner self 
became a humming factory of arguments, and he spent long hours 
reciting and writing down elaborate statements of his crime, 
which 
he constantly retouched and developed.  Then gradually his 
activity 
languished under the lack of an audience, the sense of being 
buried 
beneath deepening drifts of indifference.  In a passion of 
resentment he swore that he would prove himself a murderer, even 
if 
he had to commit another crime to do it; and for a sleepless 
night 
or two the thought flamed red on his darkness.  But daylight 
dispelled it.  The determining impulse was lacking and he hated 
too 
promiscuously to choose his victim. . .  So he was thrown back on 
the unavailing struggle to impose the truth of his story.  As 
fast 
as one channel closed on him he tried to pierce another through 
the 
sliding sands of incredulity.  But every issue seemed blocked, 
and 
the whole human race leagued together to cheat one man of the 
right 
to die.</p><p> 
     Thus viewed, the situation became so monstrous that he lost 
his last shred of self-restraint in contemplating it.  What if he 
were really the victim of some mocking experiment, the centre of 
a 
ring of holiday-makers jeering at a poor creature in its blind 
dashes against the solid walls of consciousness?  But, no&mdash;men 
were 
not so uniformly cruel: there were flaws in the close surface of 
their indifference, cracks of weakness and pity here and there. . 
.</p><p> 
     Granice began to think that his mistake lay in having 
appealed 
to persons more or <pb n="306"/>  less familiar with his 
past, and to whom 
the visible conformities of his life seemed a final disproof of 
its 
one fierce secret deviation.  The general tendency was to take 
for 
the whole of life the slit seen between the blinders of habit: 
and 
in his walk down that narrow vista Granice cut a correct enough 
figure.  To a vision free to follow his whole orbit his story 
would 
be more intelligible: it would be easier to convince a chance 
idler 
in the street than the trained intelligence hampered by a sense 
of 
his antecedents.  This idea shot up in him with the tropic 
luxuriance of each new seed of thought, and he began to walk the 
streets, and to frequent out-of-the-way chop-houses and bars in 
his 
search for the impartial stranger to whom he should disclose 
himself.</p><p> 
     At first every face looked encouragement; but at the crucial 
moment he always held back.  So much was at stake, and it was so 
essential that his first choice should be decisive.  He dreaded 
stupidity, timidity, intolerance.  The imaginative eye, the 
furrowed brow, were what he sought.  He must reveal himself only 
to 
a heart versed in the tortuous motions of the human will; and he 
began to hate the dull benevolence of the average face.  Once or 
twice, obscurely, allusively, he made a beginning&mdash;once sitting 
down at a man's side in a basement chop-house, another day 
approaching a lounger on an east-side wharf.  But in both cases 
the 
premonition of failure checked him on the brink of avowal.  His 
dread of being taken for a man in the clutch of a fixed idea gave 
him an unnatural keenness in reading the expression of his 
interlocutors, and he had provided himself in advance with a 
series 
of verbal alternatives, trap-doors of evasion from the first dart 
of ridicule or suspicion.</p><p> 
     He passed the greater part of the day in the streets, coming 
home at irregular hours, dreading the silence and orderliness of 
his apartment, and the critical scrutiny of Flint.  His real life 
was spent in a world so remote from this familiar setting that he 
sometimes had the mysterious sense of a living metempsychosis, a 
furtive passage from one identity to another&mdash;yet the other as 
unescapably himself!</p><p> 
     One humiliation he was spared: the desire to live never 
revived in him.  Not for a moment was he tempted to a shabby pact 
with existing conditions.  He wanted to die, wanted it with the 
fixed unwavering desire which alone attains its end.  And still 
the 
end eluded him!  It would not always, of course&mdash;he had full 
faith 
in the dark star of his destiny.  And he could prove it best by 
repeating his story, persistently and indefatigably, pouring it 
into indifferent ears, hammering it into dull brains, till at 
last 
it kindled a spark, and some one of the careless millions paused, 
listened, believed. . .</p><p> 
     It was a mild March day, and he had been loitering on the 
west-side docks, looking at faces.  He was becoming an expert in 
physiognomies: his eagerness no longer made rash darts and 
awkward 
recoils.  He knew now the face he needed, as clearly as if it had 
come to him in a vision; and not till he found it would he speak. 
 
As he walked eastward through the shabby reeking streets he had a 
premonition that he should find it that morning.  Perhaps it was 
the promise of spring in the air&mdash;certainly he felt calmer than 
for 
many days. . .</p><p> 
     He turned into Washington Square, struck across it 
obliquely, 
and walked up University Place.  Its heterogeneous passers always 
allured him&mdash;they were less hurried than in Broadway, less 
enclosed 
and classified than in Fifth Avenue.  He walked slowly, watching 
for his face.</p><p> 
     At Union Square he felt a sudden relapse into 
discouragement, 
like a votary who has watched too long for a sign from the altar. 
 
Perhaps, after all, he should never find his face. . .  The air 
was 
languid, and he felt tired.  He walked between the bald 
grass-plots 
and the twisted trees, making for an empty seat.  Presently he 
passed a bench on which a girl sat alone, and something as 
definite 
as the twitch of a cord made him stop before her.  He had never 
dreamed of telling his story to a girl, had hardly looked at the 
women's faces as they passed.  His case was man's work: how could 
a woman help him?  But this girl's face was extraordinary&mdash;quiet 
and wide as a clear evening sky.  It suggested a hundred images 
of 
space, distance, mystery, like ships he had seen, as a boy, 
quietly 
berthed by a familiar wharf, but with the breath of far seas and 
strange harbours in their shrouds. . .  Certainly this girl would 
understand.  He went up to her quietly, lifting his hat, 
observing 
the forms&mdash;wish-<pb n="307"/> ing her to see at once that he 
was "a 
gentleman."</p><p> 
     "I am a stranger to you," he began, sitting down beside her, 
"but your face is so extremely intelligent that I feel. . .  I 
feel 
it is the face I've waited for . . . looked for everywhere; and I 
want to tell you&mdash;"</p><p> 
     The girl's eyes widened: she rose to her feet.  She was 
escaping him!</p><p> 
     In his dismay he ran a few steps after her, and caught her 
roughly by the arm.</p><p> 
     "Here&mdash;wait&mdash;listen!  Oh, don't scream, you fool!" he 
shouted 
out.</p><p> 
     He felt a hand on his own arm; turned and confronted a 
policeman.  Instantly he understood that he was being arrested, 
and 
something hard within him was loosened and ran to tears.</p><p> 
     "Ah, you know&mdash;you <hi rend="italic">know</hi>I'm guilty!"</p><p> 
     He was conscious that a crowd was forming, and that the 
girl's 
frightened face had disappeared.  But what did he care about her 
face?  It was the policeman who had really understood him.  He 
turned and followed, the crowd at his heels. . .

                      VII 
</head>
<p> 
     IN the charming place in which he found himself there were 
so 
many sympathetic faces that he felt more than ever convinced of 
the 
certainty of making himself heard.</p> 
  <p>   It was a bad blow, at first, to find that he had not been 
arrested for murder; but Ascham, who had come to him at once, 
explained that he needed rest, and the time to "review" his 
statements; it appeared that reiteration had made them a little 
confused and contradictory.  To this end he had willingly 
acquiesced in his removal to a large quiet establishment, with an 
open space and trees about it, where he had found a number of 
intelligent companions, some, like himself, engaged in preparing 
or 
reviewing statements of their cases, and others ready to lend an 
interested ear to his own recital.</p> 
<p>     For a time he was content to let himself go on the 
tranquil 
current of this existence; but although his auditors gave him for 
the most part an encouraging attention, which, in some, went the 
length of really brilliant and helpful suggestion, he gradually 
felt a recurrence of his old doubts.  Either his hearers were not 
sincere, or else they had less power to aid him than they 
boasted.  
His interminable conferences resulted in nothing, and as the 
benefit of the long rest made itself felt, it produced an 
increased 
mental lucidity which rendered inaction more and more unbearable. 
 
At length he discovered that on certain days visitors from the 
outer world were admitted to his retreat; and he wrote out long 
and 
logically constructed relations of his crime, and furtively 
slipped 
them into the hands of these messengers of hope.</p><p> 
     This occupation gave him a fresh lease of patience, and he 
now 
lived only to watch for the visitors' days, and scan the faces 
that 
swept by him like stars seen and lost in the rifts of a hurrying 
sky.</p><p> 
     Mostly, these faces were strange and less intelligent than 
those of his companions.  But they represented his last means of 
access to the world, a kind of subterranean channel on which he 
could set his "statements" afloat, like paper boats which the 
mysterious current might sweep out into the open seas of 
life.</p><p> 
     One day, however, his attention was arrested by a familiar 
contour, a pair of bright prominent eyes, and a chin 
insufficiently 
shaved.  He sprang up and stood in the path of Peter 
McCarren.</p><p> 
     The journalist looked at him doubtfully, then held out his 
hand with a startled deprecating, <hi rend="italic">"Why&mdash;?"</hi></p><p> 
     "You didn't know me?  I'm so changed?" Granice faltered, 
feeling the rebound of the other's wonder.</p><p> 
     "Why, no; but you're looking quieter&mdash;smoothed out," 
McCarren 
smiled.</p><p> 
     "Yes: that's what I'm here for&mdash;to rest.  And I've taken the 
opportunity to write out a clearer statement&mdash;"</p><p> 
     Granice's hand shook so that he could hardly draw the folded 
paper from his pocket.  As he did so he noticed that the reporter 
was accompanied by a tall man with grave compassionate eyes.  It 
came to Granice in a wild thrill of conviction that this was the 
face he had waited for. . .</p><p> 
     "Perhaps your friend&mdash;he <hi rend="italic">is</hi>your friend?&mdash;would glance 
over it&mdash;or I could put the case in a few words if you have 
time?"  
Granice's voice shook like his hand.  If this chance escaped him 
he 
felt that his last hope was gone.  McCarren and the stranger 
looked 
at each other, and the former glanced at his watch.  
<pb n="308"/> </p><p> 
     "I'm sorry we can't stay and talk it over now, Mr. Granice; 
but my friend has an engagement, and we're rather 
pressed&mdash;"</p><p> 
     Granice continued to proffer the paper.  "I'm sorry&mdash;I think 
I could have explained.  But you'll take this, at any 
rate?"</p><p> 
     The stranger looked at him gently.  "Certainly&mdash;I'll take 
it."  
He had his hand out.  "Good-bye."</p><p> 
     "Good-bye," Granice echoed.</p><p> 
     He stood watching the two men move away from him through the 
long light hall; and as he watched them a tear ran down his face. 
 
But as soon as they were out of sight he turned and walked 
hastily 
toward his room, beginning to hope again, already planning a new 
statement. 
</p><p> 
     Outside the building the two men stood still, and the 
journalist's companion looked up curiously at the long monotonous 
rows of barred windows.</p><p> 
     "So that was Granice?"</p><p> 
     "Yes&mdash;that was Granice, poor devil," said McCarren.</p><p> 
     "Strange case!  I suppose there's never been one just like 
it?  
He's still absolutely convinced that he committed that 
murder?"</p><p> 
     "Absolutely.  Yes."</p><p> 
     The stranger reflected.  "And there was no conceivable 
ground 
for the idea?  No one could make out how it started?  A quiet 
conventional sort of fellow like that&mdash;where do you suppose he 
got 
such a delusion?  Did you ever get the least clue to it?"</p><p> 
     McCarren stood still, his hands in his pockets, his head 
cocked up in contemplation of the barred windows.  Then he turned 
his bright hard gaze on his companion.</p><p> 
     "That was the queer part of it.  I've never spoken of 
it&mdash;but 
I <hi rend="italic">did</hi>get a clue."</p><p> 
     "By Jove!  That's interesting.  What was it?"</p><p> 
     McCarren formed his red lips into a whistle.  "Why&mdash;that it 
wasn't a delusion."</p><p> 
     He produced his effect&mdash;the other turned on him with a 
pallid 
stare.</p><p> 
     "He murdered the man all right.  I tumbled on the truth by 
the 
merest accident, when I'd pretty nearly chucked the whole 
job."</p><p> 
     "He murdered him&mdash;murdered his cousin?"</p><p> 
     "Sure as you live.  Only don't split on me.  It's about the 
queerest business I ever ran into. . .  <hi rend="italic">Do about it?</hi> Why, 
what 
was I to do?  I couldn't hang the poor devil, could I?  Lord, but 
I was glad when they collared him, and had him stowed away safe 
in 
there!"</p><p> 
     The tall man listened with a grave face, grasping Granice's 
statement in his hand.</p><p> 
     "Here&mdash;take this; it makes me sick," he said abruptly, 
thrusting the paper at the reporter; and the two men turned and 
walked in silence to the gates.
